true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;I didn't do it, it's your own perception of such. The fact someone has an easier way to enter employment in the UK, doesn't mean that UK is lowering standards, just because in one of those countries standards of something may be lower.

You just did exactly that.      
You have a real problem remembering what has been previously said, it seems.

      ""You guys show selfish approach, where only UK matters. 
       Cheap goods - fine. Controlled cheap migration - fine. 
       Importing best people from the world-fine. Absolutely 
       no global view on increasing standards and profits not 
       only in the UK.""

As soon as somebody asked what's best for the UK you yelled it was selfish and that there was a wider priority.

&gt;What? Jesus, mate, you have a rare ability to see and imagine things. I wasn't talking about levels of qualification when you compare medical studies did by some shamans with the ones currently recognised as suitable for such role. 

Yet that's exactly what you were saying, 
 
       ""Doctors from better unis may have priority, but 
        nobody will say ""No applications are allowed from 
        doctors who finished x university.""

You are talking there about level of education and qualification.   

You even go on to contradict yourself, 

        ""GMC allows all (?) EU medical qualifications to be used 
         as appropriate for GMC registration in the UK, without 
         the need to supply documents, other than basic ones.""

So now you recognise that we now have standard application across the whole UK, whilst you have already recognised that some of those states don't come to  typical UK standard.

You just got through asking how standards are being reduced and have gone on to answer your own question.

&gt;Are we discussing topics connected with NHS and the EU or have you somehow became an English teacher now? Use your intelligence and TRY do understand sentences which in your opinion aren't to your standard of discussion.

We're not discussing anything in those paragraphs where you drift in and out of realms of comprehension.  That's the point.

&gt;""Could"", as long as other criteria are met but we weren't discussing these.

Oh yes we are.  

Mine was the original comment.  We are precisely discussing what we  could do.

You started by saying 'bullshit' to this, but have now flipped to conceding the point with:

       ""Obviously if NHS heavily invested in EU recruitment, 
        then it could even increase.""

**That was the point you were addressing.   
That is the point you have now conceded.**    

--------------

You just admitted your original post was wrong.

----------------------

&gt;Yeah, you really are brilliant in seeing things from only yours, the most correct, point of view. I really doubt that such costs are only these and only so small... but as you've said it yourself, we are getting off the discussion.

So you don't know of any other costs but you're just going to stipulate an assertion, not back it up, and then run for the hills...

I'll take that as another concession too.

&gt;And how would you control that if there wasn't a WTD? You would ""rely"" on personal control? Maybe the same should apply to lorry drivers as well? 

We'd just be able to tailor it to UK needs.    

Don't need the EU enforcing a crude one-size fits all standard.

Net result?  NHS improves.

&gt;Nope, you seem to have some kind of misconception on basic topics. Of course NHS is important and it's a shame there are shortages but patients are also important and shouldn't be seen by doctors working 60h per week, just because NHS cannot resolve an issue of staff shortages in NHS since 1998.

So before the EU single market and EU working times we somehow managed...

I'll take that as another concession.

&gt;As I've mentioned in one of the above, training quality is controlled by GMC and I absolutely see no problem with GMC's requirements if they find out that teaching system in one of the EU countries isn't good enough for the level of medical care in the UK.

You already argued and contradicted yourself on this.  

I'll let that one stand.

&gt;Since it was agreed that level is fine, employing doctors from the EU is now easier as it doesn't require other processes, which are required from non-EU staff.

You already lost your temper when I used the poorest in the EU as an example.

You've already accepted that the UK could hire more EU staff if it so wished.

&gt;OK, I will agree partially with it but only in connection with certain sectors, like NHS. 

So you now accept that the UK would be better off tailoring its own regulation, which it needs to be outside the EU to do.

&gt;I'm getting more and more convinced that UK's problem (and the ones shown by nationalists like you) is exactly the above.

I'm not a nationalist.    
I'm a patriot.    

If you want nationalism look at your own defence of EU supranationalism.

&gt;Your main problem is that you regard the UK too often as the greatest country 

Nope.

I already said if there is better then we can hire, recruit learn.  You lost your temper over that one too,
 
       ""You guys show selfish approach, where only UK matters.""

That was in response to saying that we should recruit, headhunt and buy from those doing something well.  To make the UK better.  You responded with criticism because they wouldn't put others before the UK improvement.

&gt;Having closer connections via the EU is a good step towards such cooperation.

Don't need to lower the UK bar to have cooperation or trade.  We certainly don't need to sacrifice our own standards.

All points which you've indirectly now agreed too.

----------------

You should really go back and re-read what it is you're arguing because you keep getting lost and changing things.

New training ground looks great.

Two marquee pre season friendlies against European sides. One home, one away. Match at St Marys a festival to celebrate new signings and new manager.

New manager search has gone quickly, talk of looking at up and coming coaches with an emphasis on attractive, attacking style of play. There is a preferred candidate that they are working on the details with. Sooner rather than later.

Before Poch left 6-10 on a shortlist. Astounded by level of applicant. Final 4 on the list originally.

On the player front: equally high level of players excited about joining.

Not had as many bids as he thought would come in. Had enquires and some bids. No way he was making decisions without new manager assessing situation.

Other clubs bidding on our players are destabilising them a bit.

IF we sell, the money is reinvested in players. But Intention is to keep all core players.

I'm glad the club is doing stuff like this now. Always good to hear about how things are going behind the scenes. Exciting times.

It seems for ever 1 person who is actually helpful there's 10 others that aren't. As soon as you sign up you're paperwork, paperwork they don't want to deal with and will try and shunt you into any job going even if it's working 40 hours for a pittance. Of course not everyone is that way, and it seems you've found someone who is decent alas your husband not so lucky. 

Secondly, don't screw up paperwork. They will not hesitate to block benefits and cause all sorts of issues if you fuck something up. I once turned down a job application because I could not get to the location...it caused a huge issue, they blocked benefits for 3 months then started saying I was working and claiming benefits at the same time.. That's when I gave up on them and went back to freelancing.

That said your husband did nothing wrong, if the NCS told him to hold off on the CV then he was right to do so. I went through the same thing although fortunately for me the person I saw at the job center wasn't an ass. The problem is the NCS isn't actually part of the Jobcenter, they are a third party. And sometimes it's a case of one hand not talking to the other.

The reaction the woman your husband saw is nutty. I would highly suggest getting her name and finding out who to complain to. I would also suggest that if your husband sees someone again to specifically state that he will not deal with that woman. I had not filled my form out once as well (family issues so I was away). The person I saw just explained that I couldn't get benefits and to notify them before going away (which I hadn't done). That was it, he didn't cancel any of my various appointments with advisors or crossed anything off on the signing on sheet (let alone someone else's...wtf).

Tell your husband not to sweat it, he's not at fault and don't let it reflect poorly on him. Unfortunately dealing with the Job Center is like trying to pull teeth from a T-Rex with parkinsons...and you have no tools or arms. It seems if you're decent people you get shit on, but if you're some coked up baby spouting alcoholic then you get the royal treatment.

The National Careers Service has a pretty good site with lots of information on that you can check out from home, I believe they have CV stuff on there too as well as other stuff.

You're absolutely correct. Whilst moving South isn't necessarily the end objective here, I cannot rule it out. We obviously have family and friends North, want to raise children around family, etc - but plans can certainly change.

&gt; Generally speaking, having a house as a residence requires at least five years before the costs of buying/selling break even against just renting.

Could you elaborate on this a little please? I think my head is at the overall net cost of owning the property. Of course the general running costs (electric, council tax..) are equal for both. But, do you mean in terms of advisors/contracts/estate agent fees/etc for initially purchasing the property versus the rental cost?

&gt; You need to seperate out your requirement for a house, and your desire for an investment. BTLs are investments, and shouldn't be confused with a place to lay your head.

Great advice, I definitely had not considered this much.

I like your point about geared returns also. Part of the puzzle is indeed balancing time, with risk, with effort, with stability, with returns.. but I think part of the problem is that **I don't *really* know which of these I want**.

You're right though, I am almost wasting money by leaving the £95,000 lazing around. I received this sum several years ago (without getting into specifics, I was much younger and didn't understand why I would want to get 1-2% interest.. wasn't £95,000 enough?). Sure enough, as the years go buy, so does the potential 1-2% annual revenue, year after year.

At the moment, my mentality was geared towards purchasing two houses, with ~£35k deposit, and using rental income to work towards the total mortgage value - leaving me with a £25k buffer. Worst case scenario is that I end up having both houses empty and have to repay the mortgage with no tennancy.. but even that would take 25 months (approx) to use up the buffer. That being said, £35k was just a number I pulled out of thin air. It could quite have easily been £25k with 3 properties, £60k with 1 property.. I just don't really know

Whilst I had looked in to S&amp;S before, I was a little reluctant to pursue due to costs, risks, and length/period of the returns. I recall reading that for them to be really worth the investment, you should look to invest over 5-10 years... but in which time, I hope to be married with children. Wont I need this money for a house, or are S&amp;Ss just used for residual savings?

Once again, thank you for your advice.",0,1402428278,null,0,false,0,ci44kec,t3_27qj9z,t1_ci44kec,t1_ci3r4ow,null,1434179751,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

Other schools only require you to take classes within or related to your field of study. Those schools are mostly more technical schools. What I've noticed with my liberal arts education is that many of the general education requirements (non-major courses) I've taken have had crossover with my major courses in unexpected ways.

Another benefit of a liberal arts education is that even the students with the most technical majors (computer science, medical sciences, engineering, etc.) are able to communicate effectively.

I've always had hearing problems, idk if it's hereditary or what the deal is, but I'm the same as my mum: really struggle when there's background noise, and if people sit on my left in these situations I'm fucked, can't hear a word they're saying. I've been for ear tests though, apparently there's nothing wrong with my hearing at all. Also, I read a little while ago that there's some sort of psychological shizz when it comes to hearing. It may or may not have something to do with whether you're left or right handed, it was something along those lines - but the article claimed it's all in the head. Given that I'm a little bit of both, but not actually ambidextrous, that may go some way to explain my problem which is not apparently a medical problem. Either that, or I'm just mental. However, it's a pain in the fucking arse and annoying :(

Quality Reporting on the important topics, that.

Meanwhile, over at the [Sunday Times](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/), the top stories are about the secret dealings that got Qatar the world cup, Fifa and Adidas having a go at each other over Qatar, the new laws about Texting while driving, a fight between David Cameron and his Cabinet, and (the only piece I consider remotely necessary) an embedded journalist chronicling a fight between Ukraine militia members and Russian Separatists.

Over at the BBC, however, they're reporting about the Islamic Militants who just took over Mosul, giving them control of one of Iraq's largest cities, the deadliest friendly-fire incident ever in the Afghan conflict, and reports that Blatter has been asked to step down next year by European football leaders.

I've definitely abused my ears too much over the years with extreme volumes in nightclubs with earphones and at gigs, but when I was tested by a specialist I was somewhere between the ages of 16 and 20, which doesn't seem to be enough abuse to fuck my hearing given you could only ever find me with my head in a book til the age of 14.

Whatever it is, it's bloody annoying. 

&gt;and just sit there nodding at people like a simpleton

This is what people don't get. Us nodding 'yes, yes' types often appear to be disinterested, thick as pigshit or just plain rude to people conversing with us.

WBA is a team that was very much in danger of relegation for a large chunk of the season that doesn't feature a ton of talent on it. They are a team that traditionally spends very little money on incoming players but also don't have a steady and productive youth system churning out top level talent....throw into the equation that 3 of their regular players have left at the end of a loan (Popov, Vydra and Amalfitano as well as Bifouma ) and an additional 6 weren't offered new contracts (Reid, Lugano, Allan, Gera, Rdigewell and Jones) and it leaves the squad relatively thin.

So Tim would be going into a team that is lacking talent, is thin on overall squad depth, doesn't have a great youth system and rarely spends big......he will be in the midst of a relegation battle from day 1 and frankly regardless of what he does or doesn't do will be lucky not to be sacked with WBA in the drop zone in December as they try to ""right the ship"" yet again.

Not a great situation to go strolling into for a new manager role....then again if he can get them playing where they avoid the drop zone the club will probably be very happy with him. So....low expectations on him could mean he can pleasantly surprise a few people is suppose?

true,myimportantthoughts,null,null,"First, I am really sorry you are going through this, it sounds really stressful. I have a family member with autism so I have some advice for helping and dealing with  your brother:

1. Don't worry about him spending all day on a computer / playing with a yo-yo / reading or whatever he is into, a deep hobby (or even obsession) is common and keeps people with autism happy. Can I ask if he has a particular 'special interest'? It doesn't have to be a 'normal' interest like CSI or Lord of the Rings, it could be something like road signs or shoes or 17th Century piracy.

2. If you go to your local GP that might be a good start for getting him some help, you should not have to look after him on your own. He should have some kind of assistance, therapy, a social group etc, especially if he has low functioning autism.

3. If he has bizarre or annoying behaviours' pick your battles wisely. If he wants to eat peanut butter toast 3 meals in a row, you can just let him, it is not worth the trouble IMO. If he is being super noisy or doing something dangerous (to himself or others) then obviously you need to stop it.

Finally, you may be able to file a civil claim against your mother to get your brother's things, it is not legal to steal (in effect) an adult's posessions. I hope it doesn't come to that, but it might be easier than replacing everything your brother owned. Simply threatening to cut off your mother's carers allowance (which she should not claim if he doesn't live with her) might be enough to get her to hand them over. 

If you have any questions about autism or just need to vent feel free to PM me.

true,QueryingQuail,null,null,"Cost averaging (""dollar cost averaging"" or ""pound cost averaging"") is where you have a lump sum to invest, but rather than invest it all in one go you spread it out into multiple investments (purchases) over a period of time. The idea is that it protects you from the risk of your investment having a sudden fall just after you invest a lump sum.

This is definitely not financial advice, but I don't favour it myself. Given the timescales that people typically cost-average across (months to a year or two) and the timescales over which market bubbles and crashes happen, I can't see that it buys you a lot. Instead of worrying that the market might fall after a lump-sum investment, you have the risk of just the same thing happening just after, say, your last tranche of a cost-averaged investment. ISTR that some research from Vanguard indicated that cost-averaging generally lead to lower returns (which IMO is to be expected, as basically it means keeping low-return cash for some time instead of higher-expected-return investments).

I think the value of cost-averaging, if any, is likely to be psychological, particularly for new investors.

Personally, I think the bigger question about your strategy is whether you really want to be keeping money in lower-return cash throughout the year rather than higher-return investments. If we simplify massively and say you're putting back £X per year into savings and then into investments (excluding the part you use for your holiday) then over your term of investment you're losing something like the compounded difference between investment return and cash return on ~£X/2 for the entire term (decades?)

true,Lil_Miss_Scribble,null,null,"I'm sorry to hear that the advisor added to your difficulties especially at a time when you both need support.

The job centre is just a hoop to jump through in order to get the allowance. Designed to only be given to those that are persistent instead of those most in need. The career opportunities that are best for you are the ones you'll find through your own searches. The Job Centre will not necessarily have your best interests at heart - but they do hold the paperwork that leads to the allowance you need.  

The good advisors there probably get their patience tested daily and the bad ones are there as they have little other choice career wise.

So, with that in mind - treat the job centre as a means to an end (to get the support needed in times like this) - phone them, be rational, firm &amp; fair. Explain what you &amp; your husband want, which courses would suit &amp; what you feel is best. Get a firm understanding when you can expect your allowance to start. Explain the previous session didn't go well and that you are trying to resolve it. You know the previous advisor was wrong - be as objective as you can on the phone. This time around you will be speaking to someone different and hopefully more sympathetic. Unfortunately to get the allowance it does mean completing the job search diaries etc - even if it is very basic.

In terms of finding a job quickly, are there any agencies that you could sign up with? They tend to specialise in short term work, they can start staff quickly &amp; pay week to week. That would be ideal to get money coming in whilst still searching for a longer term job. 

If I can help in a more practical way, please let me know. I worked in recruitment for 3+ years and still write CVs on a freelance basis as it is very rewarding. If a CV re-write would be of interest I would be happy to do that. Currently I manage a team of I.T technicians so I'm regularly reviewing applications &amp; interviewing for jobs in that industry.

If he's an IT professional with relevant skills, he was probably on more pay than any of the job center staff will hope to make in that type of career, more knowledgeable than them and as you can see, what they offer is inadequate compared to what your husband is worth.

You wouldn't let someone who has a few ""MS Office Skills"" plan your IT deployment, why would you let someone with such little enterprise experience dictate what career path you take?

OK so with the elitism out of the way, if I was in your husbands position, I would look to immediately starting self-employed, but also sign up with an agency for day-to-day menial work to have some income.

First, some context. It's a fairly new school opened in the past 10 years, but going by GCSE and A-Level grades, this faith school is one of the best comprehensive state schools in the country and does outstanding in Ofsted inspections (as a result of intense preparation in the time given, it's all a farce). The majority of the pupils, including myself, aren't observant but nevertheless the school actively promotes orthodox values, to the point where the school tries its best to prevent students eating in ""inappropriate"" resturants in their school uniform and just generally control their lives when they're out of school. However, the secular education is excellent and the majority of students totally ignore, and sometimes actively mock the religious messages thrown at us.

Anyway, a couple of years ago a friend of mine was struggling with her sexuality. Due to problems in the home she was a smoker and was already pulled into meetings to try and force her off the habit. She even got in trouble various times for little things such as dyeing her hair. Eventually, she quietly came out as a lesbian and tried her best to hide it from staff, as homosexuality is viewed as ""an abomination"" (bible words) within the religion the students practice (yet it also preaches not to be homophobic, nice logic there). A week later, staff members found out and were already talking about it. At the behest of the headteacher, they tried to force her to see a psychiatrist in order to ""cure"" her homosexuality. Thankfully, the psychiatrist made a different judgement and deemed what the school asked of them to be unethical, thus causing the school to eat their words. They kept calling her into meetings throughout her GCSE's and she left the school after passing her exams. I am pleased to report that she's now happily in a relationship and taking her A-Levels in a secular school elsewhere.

**TL;DR: Girl came out as lesbian, school freaked out, hired psychiatrist to indoctrinate girl, psychiatrist then turned school away.**

Though it's also worth noting that you can do this by bouncing the same £500 between the TSB accounts and a non-TSB account (at least, that's how it usually works.)

So if you have two TSB accounts T1 and T2, and a non-TSB account N, you should be able to set up standing orders to (each month) move £500 from N to T1, then from T1 to N, then from N to T2, then from T2 back to N.

I also know that the school I went to topped national league tables a couple of times. Arguably this is because it was selective and probably had little do with segregation. I couldn't really say. All I know is I had a wicked time at school and so did most of my friends. The ones who had a bad time probably would have a bad time at a mixed school aswell.


I feel like you are turning a relatively harmless tradition into an issue when it isn't. And segregation is the wrong word to use. Most boys schools are paired with a girls school. We get the same school buses, have the same events and 6th forms are mixed. We were never discouraged from socialising with girls.

It'll be interesting to see what he does at WBA, because that's a team you can't just get by with winning only game against teams below you on the EPL table.

true,Nark2020,null,null,"&gt; That final point represents the heart of the matter. The problem is not that the schools were creating thousands of 11-year-old Osama Bin Ladens. It was that via religious indoctrination they were creating children who were being prized apart from modern British society even before they were ready to take their full role in it. 

These sentences form a sensible account of the situation, usefully avoiding the dog-whistle term 'extremism'. Kids seemed to be receiving an education that set them apart. 

&gt; And that charge can – to a greater or lesser extent – be levelled at just about every faith-based school.

Hmm. On this, I'm willing to go with 'Lots and lots of exclusive i.e. white and Christian private schools also segregate by gender and also keep their kids away from the realities of life'. 

Meanwhile, does anyone else feel as though this debate keeps going back to 'Faith schools are bad because they make people different'? That assumes a lot, namely that normal is good and different is bad. Should schools prepare their kids for McDonalds, call-centres and occasionally getting wanked off or fingered in the toilet of a provincial nightclub? That would be fairly 'normal'. 

The legitimate issue, I think, is were the schools teaching their kids in a way that would make their lives in Britain *difficult*. The kids are the people we should be caring about.

But our overall team play was sloppy. We couldn't piece more than two passes going forward and relied on going through the full backs to make it to the opposition half which made us easy to figure out for any team above us. When other teams had the ball, it was usually Lloris saving the day single handily. This was exemplified best by how Hugo said there is something wrong when the keeper is the best player in the team.

true,Fox_bat,null,null,"After a while you become numb to the travesty that is the DWP and their 'administration' of the benefits system and nothing surprises you any more. It makes you want to laugh and cry at the state of it but it doesn't surprise. But any way enough of that.
 
Firstly if nothing else complain. You must absolutely complain about the treatment you have received. Far too many people 'suck it up' especially those in the younger bracket for JSA (18-24). You can find information on the JC+ complaints procedure [here](https://www.gov.uk/complain-jobcentre-plus).

In terms of your financial situation you have some options so don't panic just yet. First ring the Jobcentre on 0345 604 3719 and ask for a [Short Term Benefit Advance](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/scotland/benefits_s/benefits_help_if_on_a_low_income_s/help_for_people_on_a_low_income_-_the_social_fund_and_other_welfare_schemes.htm#advance_payment_of_benefit). Clearly only having £10 in you bank account is the sort of situation that should trigger a SBA.

Then you should visit a local [Citizens Advice Bureau](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/wales/about_this_site/get_advice.htm) or contact your local authorities Welfare Rights Unit (if you're lucky enough to have one). They will be able to help you out both in dealing with your benefit issue but also they should be able to issue you with a voucher for a food parcel.

Also write to you [local MP](http://findyourmp.parliament.uk/) explain the issue, tell them that you are complaining. If the DWP don't resolve the complaint to your satisfaction tell your MP get them to chase it up with the DWP.

Don't worry about getting on someone's hit list. Jobcentre staff have legislation, that is law, that they must follow when regulating benefits. If they fail to do so properly you can beat them around the head with complaints and through HM Courts and Tribunals service. They might appear to have all the power but they most certainly do not. They are Civil Servants and the key word here is Servant. They might not like it but it is the truth. Do not give in.

Next that fact that your husband did not use their little booklet to record his job search activity is totally irrelevant. There is no requirement to use that booklet. The DWP's [Decision Makers Guidance](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/296117/dmgch21.pdf) Paragraph 21592 clearly states that proof that a claimant is actively seeking work includes: 

1. evidence in writing from employers, employment agencies or other bodies that the claimant has contacted **or** 
2. copies of letters that the claimant has sent to employers **or** 
3. the claimant's uncorroborated written evidence (claimants are advised to keep a record of their job search and other efforts to find work) **or** 
4. the claimant's own verbal evidence, recorded by an officer of the Jobcentre Plus office. 

Diddly squat in there about having a 'job search paper'. Hell by my reading if you turned up with no paperwork and described to the advisor what you'd been doing they'd have to accept it.

A couple of other points. You mention that your husband is disabled have you considered claiming [Employment and Support Allowance](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/wales/benefits_w/benefits_sick_or_disabled_people_and_carers_ew/employment_and_support_allowance.htm)? This might be a more appropriate benefit for you to claim and it's more geared towards someone who can't deal with the high pressure of Job Seekers Allowance. You could also think about [Personal Independence Payment](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/wales/benefits_w/benefits_sick_or_disabled_people_and_carers_ew/benefits_personal_independence_payment_e/benefits_pip_where_to_start_e/pip_where_to_start.htm) (if he isn't already getting it or the older benefit Disability Living Allowance). PIP isn't means tested and it isn't based off of National Insurance contributions and it almost always is paid in addition to other benefits so won't affect your JSA/ESA heck it normally triggers extra money.",0,1402440801,null,0,false,0,ci4auqu,t3_27t0ri,t1_ci4auqu,t3_27t0ri,null,1434182782,35,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,35

It is so easy to use and you just do small short strokes and you can get a pretty straight line especially with practice.

The Collection 2000 lasting perfection concealer is also really great, although I do find it is a little too cakey for me under the eyes but great to cover up blemishes.

Rimmel Stay Matte powder is my absolute favourite powder. You can get it in a coloured version or in the translucent shade which I prefer. I am very pale and usually when I purchase coloured powders they make my face a little too dark so translucent powder is great.

For blushes I really love the [MUA powder blushes]( http://bittersweetshelby.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/makeup-academy-mua-new-powder-blusher.html) that only cost £1. They have really great pigmentation and honestly they are so good for the price.

I disagree Scotland is a homogeneous country, 96% of it's country is White British, not including Black British and Wales which has a 97% British population. Not exactly multicultural.

true,eytiuqe,null,null,"Hi IanCal. Thanks very much for your response.

You raise some fantastic points with regards to capital gains (which I had never even come across), and rental income. Time and money I have, but just a bit baffled by the bits inbetween. Obviously you have raised points that I have not yet considered or knew existed (such as higher interest on mortgage rates and deposits).

Defaulting is of course a major concern. As I've just mentioned in another response, I had thought purchasing 2 properties with a deposit, but leaving myself enough financial backup to cover the mortgage for a period of time should there be issues finding tenancy.

However, I think you may be right with the cash ISA/S&amp;S. Initially I hadn't considered them (S&amp;S) as I read that you should *really* wait 5-10 years to see any significant gains.. however, as I mentioned in my initial post that it may be 5 years before I move North anyway - it may not be such a bad plan afterall!

I now further understand the concept of having to pay for a roof, whether or not a mortgage is taken out. Having done some calculations this evening.. greater fixed costs of owning a property and living far exceed my initial estimations. £500 rent doesn't actually seem so bad, anymore.

The capital essentially came from the sale of a web property back when I was a teenager, and no longer receive a regular income of any substantial amount (as I'm quite fortunate to have no dependencies and can rely on that to some extent). I should have perhaps asked some of these questions several years ago.. and the money could have perhaps gone to better use throughout).

Once again, thank you for your reply IanCal!

However, there's also the fact that once he's read their gravestones, it's fixed, as is -- most importantly -- the date of their death and their age at death. The gravestones mean that he cannot have saved them, ergo he cannot save them now; it's too late. Obviously, if he saved them he wouldn't allow them to age and die appropriately for that gravestone, and now that he's seen the gravestone, he can't have saved them or it would create a paradox.

Of course, in Waters of Mars, he already read about the deaths, death dates, and death ages of those two kids from the Mars base, and he was still able to save them without the universe ripping apart, so who the hell knows?

On a less technical note than everything else: 

It can be very stressful having money and reading all these posts. There are many pros and cons to everything you do, greater security vs greater risk, different time periods, feeling like you missed out on that great opportunity...

Always remember how well you're doing right now. Most people would be in debt, but you aren't. Few people would be looking into what best to do with their money. You're asking questions and even if we can't give straight answers the fact you're thinking about it puts you in a small minority. While there are different benefits of putting your money in one place vs another, as long as you're not wasting it everything you do will be *good* if not *the best*.

&gt;

&gt;The __Southern League__, currently known as the __Calor League__ under the terms of a sponsorship agreement,  is an [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) men's [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) competition featuring semi-professional and amateur clubs from the [South West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_England), 'South Central' and [Midlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Midlands) of England and [South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales). Together with the [Isthmian League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmian_League) and the [Northern Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Premier_League) it forms levels seven and eight of the [English football league system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_league_system#The_system).

&gt;The structure of the Southern League has changed several times since its formation in 1894, and currently there are 67 clubs which are divided into three divisions. The Premier Division is at step 3 of the [National League System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_System) (NLS), and is a feeder division, mainly to the [Conference South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_South) but also to the [Conference North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_North). Feeding the Premier Division are two regional divisions, Division One South &amp; West and Division One Central, which are at step 4 of the NLS. These divisions are in turn fed by various regional leagues.

Tough shit, I hate your interpretation of what it means to be English because it's horrifically inaccurate to reality. Your parents born here, you were born here and to my knowledge you continue live here, like it or not, you're English, though from what you're saying about this country could do without people like you whom will do nothing but insult it and rant about how shit it is all while refusing to move somewhere else, hypocrisy at its finest.

&gt;multiculturalism idea or opinion, You expect them to get all insecure and defensive (which is, just guess, what I'm doing right now!) so you can humiliate them and insult them.

Saying Britain is multicultural is inaccurate because it simply isn't, England is the only country that isn't homogeneous. 

I said previously that one of the reasons I'm proud to be English is because of the idea that we're a country of a large number of different races you pre-judgmental cunt. 


&gt;pretend to be an nice honest person.

Or maybe that said person is a nice and honest person, they do exist amazingly enough, ever thought that it's you that's being the dickhead?

&gt;When someone says ""I'm English"", no one in this country with skin darker than a peach thinks ""this person is a logical, rational thinker! His point is totally going to be based on reason!"".

Please don't speak for anyone other than yourself, you don't have the right, you're talking out of your arse. Go to any pub when England are playing and witness the mix of people there, heck watch the actual ENGLISH players whom aren't white, I know! It's amazing!

Look at all these 'peach skins' who are proud to be English, yes they exist, it's lunacy!

There is also the mortgage interest, which is what the bulk of your payments go towards in the early years of a mortgage.  On a flat there will also be leasehold charges to pay, plus all the maintenance and repairs which are covered in a rental will be down to you.

Just because somebody has come in to report a domestic assault, doesn't mean they're then held there until the person is traced, regardless of whether the checks were done or not, the woman still would have been taken home at some point that day. There's hundreds of high risk domestic victims in every city across the nation, the police station would be full of them if that was the case.

She was left in a secured house, he came bashing through the door with a hammer, you could have done all the checks on him you wanted, nothing would have stopped him kicking down the door...Again, having police officers stand outside the addresses of high risk domestic victims would leave no officers in any city.

I'm not a fucking babysitter, she's a grown adult who can make her own decisions. She started dating a guy who she thought had ""only been convicted of armed robbery"" well there was definitely no warning signs there. 

Modern Britain is completely devoid of any personal responsibility, everybody has to be babysat by the police, and when their shitty decision making comes to a horrendous conclusion it's the fault of the police.

Police Scotland have started taking domestics very seriously, we've got a zero tolerance approach to domestics nowadays, we deal with them with absolute paranoia. Even in Scotland, if this woman had nowhere else to stay, she would have been returned home and this would STILL have happened. Even in a land where the paranoia surrounding domestics is absolutely killing regular policing. 

England and Wales very well might not be doing enough for their domestic victims, but in this case, even in Scotland where we've gone so far to the extreme at the other end, this still would have ended in tragedy.

The system is designed to grind you down, but you know what they need to see and can supply it regularly, you'll find it gets a little easier.

Perhaps ask Citizen's Advice about whether it's worth submitting a complaint?  

I don't know the current system, but at the time I had to supply 15 'activities' a week, so each morning I'd check the UJ site, reed, cvlibrary, totaljobs, and maybe others, that'd take me up to 5 a day before I'd even applied for anything, then there'd be the weekly local papers, and when I did my weekly shop or went anywhere I'd check shop windows and the like and write that down too.

Anything that CAN go on your record should do.  In my experience, if you're regularly exceeding your targets they're not so harsh on you, tho I can't promise you'll get any sense out of your husband's adviser.

Having said that, and not defending their actions, they could just have had a lousy day and just had someone being really unpleasant to them, it's probably best to try to go in like nothing happened and try to just give them what they want.  If they're still being 'unhelpful' then it may be time to write to the manager.

true,bawbawbaw1,null,null,"I went through Irish medium education and in the long run I'm glad I did for a few reasons. 

It was unique compared to what my mates were taught in school, on both sides. It was secular. We learnt as much (if not more) about Protestantism, Judaism and Islam (this is before the mainstream scaremongering of Islam) as we did about Catholicism even though the school would have been about 99% ""Catholic"" (couple of token prods and a few Indian kids) and a lot of the teachers had previous involvement in the Republican movement in some form or another. Some were just passionate about their language and didn't get involved or even secretly resented the Politicisation of it. 

We didn't call teachers sir or miss or any of that bollocks, it was first name basis and it was actually a policy of the school. Obviously the entire purpose of Irish medium education is to promote the use of the language and stop it from essentially dying, rather than making it a working language - that's for other organisations to try and achieve in my opinion and you have to be realistic since most of the population don't know/don't care, but over a decade later and I'm glad I learnt it. I'm comfortable with my national identity as an Irishman, Ulsterman, a Nordie in general, and someone who accepts the border as it stands even if I don't particularly agree with its existence for nationalistic reasons. I think that knowing the language plays a big part in that, and I don't have to constantly re-enforce who or what I am to myself and others compared to how some others do. 

History was somewhat impartial, we learnt what was on the curriculum but like any school, you'll be taught other things depending on what the teacher knows. So we learnt the general stuff about WW2, as well as Irish history, but very little of English or British history other than ""the Empire was bad"". Importantly, our teacher made it clear that Irish people played a massive part the growth of that Empire and that's pretty significant because its taboo in the nationalist community and especially taboo down south - people don't want to know that their ancestors were part and parcel of the Empire and helped it expand into the biggest Empire the world has ever seen in the traditional sense of taking over other peoples lands. He didn't make it a shaming session, it was just an open and honest discussion about our role. I welcome that 100% and that class was very influential on how I formed my opinions about my identity and our history. 

The downside was the over-emphasis of Irish culture (not Republican Irish culture, but a kind of weepy eyed traditional perception of what Irishness is) which meant that football was frowned upon in favour of GAA, and Rugby was non-existent. I firmly believe that sport is a real possibility to be a unifying force from a young age, and I never liked GAA anyway because I was shite at it. So that bit wasn't so hot. 

Honestly, two modern languages should be compulsory at GCSE level, and before that, Irish should be taught to all, if not to speak it, then to understand the cultural importance it has to everyone in Northern Ireland whether or not they actually realise it. Philosophy, Politics and Sociology should be taught from the second you walk into secondary school. That includes the practical elements and some basic theoretical elements that are easy to understand. We should be teaching children the concept of ""rights"" and how having a ""right"" to something does not give an automatic ""right"" to offend others. Basically teaching kids not to be ballbags when they grow up.

Most important of all, kids should be taught real geography. I don't mean how earthquakes work or what the symbols behind the weatherman mean, I mean the different regions of the world, the different cities, countries, their laws, customs, fairly in-depth stuff. Too many kids from the Falls and Shankill believe the world ends when those roads hit the city centre.

true,groovyreg,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"I used to work for JCP. Processes will have changed a bit since my time there but this principle will no doubt remain: the Jobcentre isn't there to find you work, it's there to administer unemployment benefits. To 'earn' your JSA you need to carefully jump through the hoops placed before you. If that overlaps with actually getting closer to employment then that's great but it's not the most important thing. Once you get into the groove this shouldn't take up too much of your time. 

There's always one advisor at every Jobcentre who is either bitter at the world or on a jumped up power trip, who delights in giving jobseekers a hard time. Don't take it personally. In due course you'll both be in employment, hopefully doing jobs you enjoy - that challenge you, where you are respected for your efforts. The Jobcentre advisor still be sat behind that desk taking petty revenge on poor unfortunates. They will still be hating their job and their life but will be too scared of losing their pension, too institutionalised to ever have a prospect of employment elsewhere themselves. 

TL;DR Keep your heads down, attend your appointments, complete your job search. The Jobcentre can't really help you find work so the less you appear on their radar the less chance they'll get in your way.

Rahul Verma, a Delhi expert on street food, stated in 2009 that the dish originated - probably by accident with subsequent improvisations - in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh during the last 50 years.*

*One claim recounts how a Pakistani chef, Ali Ahmed Aslam (proprietor of the Shish Mahal restaurant in the west end of Glasgow) invented chicken tikka masala by improvising a sauce made from yogurt, cream and spices. His son Asif Ali told the story of its 1971 invention to the BBC's Hairy Bikers TV cookery programme:*

*""On a typical dark, wet Glasgow night a bus driver coming off shift came in and ordered a chicken curry. He sent it back to the waiter saying it's dry. At the time Dad had an ulcer and was enjoying a plate of tomato soup. So he said why not put some tomato soup into the curry with some spices. They sent it back to the table and the bus driver absolutely loved it. He and his friends came back again and again and we put it on the menu.""*

*In July 2009 Pakistani-born British MP Mohammad Sarwar tabled an Early Day Motion in the House of Commons asking that Parliament support a campaign for Glasgow to be given European Union protected geographical status for chicken tikka masala. The motion was not chosen for debate, nor did Sarwar speak on this subject in Parliament.*

*Ethnic food historians Peter and Colleen Grove discuss various origin-claims of chicken tikka masala, suggesting that ""the shape of things to come may have been a recipe for Shahi Chicken Masala in Mrs Balbir Singh’s Indian Cookery published in 1961"".*

who knows what to believe in the T window...maybe we'll be able to hold on to him by shipping him out for a full season loan. hopefully to an EPL team to show him he's in our future plans.

Nope to that also.

If Suso is the yard stick for world class talent then Sterling, Texeira, Coutinho have it too. 

Coutinho is just over a year older than him. But Coutinho is pretty much the age he is now when he first came here and yet within that second half of the season he was running games. Fulham, Wigan, Newcastle. He was tearing teams apart. Suso is nowhere near that, and I can't see him making that much of an improvement either. If he was as good as ""world class talent"" do you not think there'd be a host of other clubs wanting to take him off our hands? Suso drifts in and out, in and out.

I'm not justifying it or condoning it, but one perspective that not many people see is from the other side which goes some way to explaining this.

I used to work at a welfare to work provider - one of the companies that JCP refer people to after a certain period of joblessness under the work programme. I was in IT for them so didn't do anything customer facing but I did get to see things from the other side of the table from colleagues (including my girlfriend at the time who was a trainer). The sad fact is that the vast majority of people don't want the help and have absolutely no intention of doing a days work in their life. From an honest, hard working persons perspective (like the OP sounds), it's difficult to understand just how bad this is.

We had statistics on what customers told us their priorities were - in some parts of the country (London was the worst) it was well over 95% and you can safely assume some people lied on that question to try and stop their benefits being taken away.

I'll reiterate, I wouldn't condone any such behaviour but when you see how bad it is, you can understand how people at least begin to get jaded - how they react when this happens depends on the individual.

Sterling and Coutinho indeed have world class talent.  But they are way ahead of Suso because they play like men. ""Running games"" has less to do with your raw ability and more to do with your intelligence and understanding. Suso's development doesn't have anything to do with his base level of talent. And you can't deny that there is a HUGE base level of talent. 

His ball control is easily world class. there are few players that can hold onto the ball in tight situations as well as he does. he does this consistently. This is a special talent and very useful to a team. think about a player that draws 2-3 defenders in, then gets passed them with the ball at his feet. also a pressure outlet that can be trusted. Not only that but his range of passing is better or just as good as any EPL midfielder. There are plenty of grown midfielders who can't cross as well as he can. if you're above the average professional, I consider that world class.

GCSE maths, whilst being dumbed down to the point where it's almost meaningless to anyone who would want to judge someone's mathematical ability (If maths matters for a university course/job, then your GCSE maths isn't where they'll look), having a basic understanding of maths is more important than any other subject done to a GCSE level at school. 

The argument that ""I'll never have to solve a quadratic in the real world"" is just weak; When will anyone have to discuss whether the Russian revolution was a positive force in European politics? Or some other history question (I didn't do GCSE history, so I don't really know what they ask (also, sorry for picking on history, it's just an example)).

Do you think that people should decide what job they want when they're 12, before we have any idea if they would be suitable for it? GCSEs have to be general because people don't know what they want at the age of 12/13.

The current system works well, because people can do what they enjoy when they have the choice, but before they're old enough to be deciding what they want to try to do in later life, they don't decide. which means that people are generally educated in what they are interested in post GCSE, which in turn means that they have a better chance of finding a fulfilling job.",0,1402474676,null,0,false,0,ci4ngm6,t3_27sokp,t1_ci4ngm6,t1_ci4dajx,null,1434188788,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Answers to some common questions:

The level of unemployment is not calculated from the number of people on JSA, so sanctions will not affect it. These figures are based on a survey called the Labour Force Survey. There are unemployed who are not entitled to JSA (e.g. those with a large household income due to a spouse, or those with large savings, or those on sanctions) and there are arguably people on JSA who are not unemployed (i.e. fraudsters). The two are not the same.

The figures are calculated by the Office of National Statistics. They are independent. The government does not interfere with the calculation of the figures, or set the way in which they are calculated. Though knowing how the numbers are calculated does mean governments can set policy accordingly. It may create targets which are not in the best interest of the public. The way the numbers are calculated is based on internationally agreed conventions.

Zero-hour contracts are not measured. However there is some measure of “underemployment” in that those who are in part-time work but wish to be in full-time work are recorded. People self-select whether they are full time or part time. Equally those on temporary contracts who wish to be permanent are also counted. 

The rate of unemployment is an economic measure of spare labour in the workforce, not a political measure of how well a government is doing at making sure everyone is happy with their job situation. As such, those on workfare, government training programmes or unpaid internships are not counted as unemployed. They do not currently have spare labour to add to the economy. However, those on “Government supported training &amp; employment programmes” are reported separately, so you may recast the figures should you wish.

The figures are seasonally adjusted, so there is no effect from things such as Christmas jobs.

Given that the numbers are based on a survey, the figures can never be perfectly accurate and there is a substantial margin of error. The numbers should be seen as approximate and are best understood in terms of the trends they show over time.

With my sister, she doesn't have social or general anxiety. It's very much specifically health related. My mom is a definite enabler which doesn't help and my dad is really just as bad. Hypochondria is something fairly prevalent in my family so I guess it's no surprise. 

As for treatment, she's seen shrinks and been to therapy for a bit but stopped going after ""her therapist told her she has no more problems and doesn't need therapy any longer..."" Which I highly doubt. It's just frustrating to me especially as I suffer pretty much all the time with my OCD, anxiety and depression. Often times it's me trying to explain or help family understand my issues and for the most part my sister is the main detractor. She tells everyone that I'm just lazy and that my problems are in my head (duh) and that I just use them to manipulate family or friends, which is not at all true. 

Me and my sister don't see eye to eye and she carries a massive amount of resentment towards me for the almost constant treatment cycles, therapists and medication which all bring attention to my ""patient status"". I'm not sure what to name it as but it seems she is seeking some kind of chronic diagnosis in order to receive the same patient treatment that I get. I don't blame her for being jealous, at times it's too much for me. I wish her and I got along better but she has no respect for me or my personal struggle. Obviously as you can tell this whole thing frustrates me because instead of looking for phantom tumours, constantly missing work for inpatient procedures, she could be working with a good therapist who could really help her a great deal more than going from one doctor to another looking for second oppinions. 

I hope this doesn't come across as resentful because I truly want her to get well and to find happiness, however I see everyone around her enabling her to be more and more concerned about non-existent illnesses or diseases. A big part of the issue is that because of my long history of mental illness and therapy etc, she views anything therapy related as only being for people with ""mental problems"" or serious issues with drugs. I wish I could help her get help but she doesn't listen to anything I say and most of my advice is sneered at as the rantings of some disturbed sibling Shed rather not be around.

true,BittersweetShelby,null,null,"My all time favourite 'nude' lipstick is the [Rimmel Lasting Finish]( https://imgur.com/a/uMAq5) by Kate in 101. This shade is a nude pink colour which is great for people with paler skin. Many true 'nude' almost conealer like lipsticks are not great for those of us with pale skin as it can really make you lose colour within the face and make you look very sickly. Because of this I like using a very subtle pink shade to give a little colour while still giving a nude type of finish on the lips. 

This lipstick has great pigmentation and is a matte formula. if you prefer the normal lipstick formulas you can add a touch of gloss over the top to give it a little shine. Although the lipstick is matte it is by no means drying on the lips ( I have very sensitive lips and this is usually a problem for me but this lipstick does not bother them at all ). 

I also own a ton of the [Nyx Round Lipsticks]( http://bittersweetshelby.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/nyx-round-lipstick-reviewswatches.html) which are very reasonably priced.

Free healthcare for all but she and my dad made their mind up to go privately so in my mind there is a big incentive to exhaustively try all diagnostic procedures as she is paying out the ass for them. I get such great care through the nhs.

I feel he has engrained in my sister the same entitlement and superiority complex. That part probably saddens me the most because I was raised to be humble and thankful for what we have.

the Postcode Address File. The PAF is a computerised list, owned by Royal Mail, of all the
addresses to which mail is delivered. The PAF is updated by ONS every six months.The actual frame used for the LFS, and most other ONS social surveys, is the ‘small users file’, a
sub-file of the complete PAF. 'Small users' are defined as delivery points which receive relatively
few items of mail per day. This automatically excludes from the frame many businesses and other
non-household institutions. However, the small users file still contains some non-private and nonLabour

residential (therefore ineligible) addresses, which cannot be identified prior to the interviewer
making contact. Interviewers have instructions to exclude such institutions and classify them as
ineligible.
The number of addresses selected from the PAF for Wave 1 each quarter is currently 16,640 – a
number that has remained constant for many years now. The selection process currently
employed is as follows:
• The complete frame of delivery points is first ordered by Postcode, and within that by
address.
• The sampling interval, k, (required for systematic sampling) is then calculated by dividing
the total number of addresses (that is delivery points in England and Wales, and the
multi-occupancy size marker in Scotland) by 16,640. This currently gives a 1-in-1586
Wave 1 quarterly sample size.
• A random start is chosen from {1, 2, …, k}, and that address and every kth one after it are
marked. This selection creates what is called the pre-sample.

And it is not so cut-and-dry that going to a segregated school will make a person more or less able to socialise with the opposite gender.

In my case, I went to a mixed school up to the age of 16, then moved to a boys' school for A-levels. I was extremely shy in the mixed school, but after moving to the boys' school, I became much more self confident and this carried over to university where I was much less awkward around girls. Also, my academic abilities went up by a huge amount at the boys' school.

Obviously there are many factors in play, like the people I met, the different setting, just plain growing up, the teaching quality, etc. But I personally found that being at that boys' school was a huge improvement to almost every aspect of my personality and abilities, rather than a hindrance.

Just my own experience, obviously can't say it applies to everyone.

true,pharao007,null,null,"&gt;As soon as somebody asked what's best for the UK you yelled it was selfish and that there was a wider priority.

Mate, you have serious issue with interpretation and again switched to different topic. This discussion is getting ridiculous. In your quote of what I've written I don't say ANYTHING in relation to your suggestion that I want to decrease UK's standards. Why are you jumping few steps forward and make some kind of own vision of such?

&gt;*Doctors from better unis may have priority, but nobody will say ""No applications are allowed from doctors who finished x university*...... You are talking there about level of education and qualification

That sentence related to the UNIVERSITIES IN THE UK!!! And I am NOT talking about qualification as qualification is recognised as being on the same level. If you become a doctor in the UK it doesn't matter which university you did. Level of education can vary but at worse is the minimum required for the degree sought. Of course employers may prefer graduates from Oxford, rather than some uni which is at the bottom of the best unis in the UK but it is only up to them to decide and they won't automatically say in an advert that application from university xxx won't be counted as this university isn't in the top three.

&gt;You just got through asking how standards are being reduced and have gone on to answer your own question.

NO! I did NOT! Standards are NOT reduced, because those standards ALREADY EXIST in EU countries! If a required standard didn't exist and that was recognised by the GMC (specialistic body - not some think tank or group of politicians) than I have absolutely no problem with GMC not allowing easier registration. I don't know how exactly they worked that system out but it's very probably it was done on international level, between GMC and all other EU medical bodies, most probably supervised by the EU.

If your perception of what I have written was that I wanted for the UK to automatically assume ALL qualifications in the EU are already on the standard required in the UK, then you are wrong. Standards of such are done on educational level (as in required bodies, schools or whatever). My main point was in relation to the visa system.

&gt;You just admitted your original post was wrong.

**NO IT WAS NOT** - I have absolute right to judge a current situation on CURRENT solution, NOT ""WHAT IF"". You fail to acknowledge that and always try to find something potential which would back up your argument, which is simply a ridiculous way of making a discussion. The point still stands as correct, especially that we can't predict what will exactly happen, how long it would take, what costs of such would be. Just because similar solution is applied in some non-EU countries, it doesn't mean the same will apply and meet all above requirements in potential situation.

&gt;So you don't know of any other costs but you're just going to stipulate an assertion, not back it up, and then run for the hills...

Why would I do that? What is this, a homework? Just because something isn't proven, in ANY way (you haven't proven to me that costs are indeed low) it doesn't mean it's incorrect. Again, we are going off the original topic (reminds me of grandpa Simpson), as you made some kind of connection with possible scenario and now want to pursue it because you can't admit you were wrong. 

In any case, the costs will ALWAYS be higher, just take into account the cost for a visa or administration work connected with helping that person migrate to the UK. Knowing the UK's prices, which are often overpriced in certain sectors, the whole thing isn't cheap as you have described it. Even the plane ticket for that person and the distance to home country is an issue. I have migrated so know a little about it, have you? At the end of the day a person takes everything into account before making a final decision on whether to migrate or not. The same applies with the NHS, who I bet prefers making a local advert for a doctor, next step looking at CVs and final asking people for an interview and if successful, completing an employment by getting relevant paperwork, which is NIN, copy of passport, copy of medical certificate... and that's it, they have an employee.

You arguing above only shows the way you people think ridiculously. You love your great leader so much you absolutely see no negatives in your anti-EU agenda. It's like your great leader praising Putin and later you lot defending him. For fuck sake, I have a whole bunch of things which I could say toward a politician, whose party I support.

&gt;You've already accepted that the UK could hire more EU staff if it so wished.

Under what cost? How long it would take etc. Look point above. Oh, you mentioned yourself that WTD was bad and NHS can't cope because of that. How long would it take for the NHS to switch to higher recruitment in the EU, if they couldn't recruit as easily as they can now? How long until the immediate gap of shortage would be filled. You act like absolutely there is nothing to worry about which is simply delusion. Brexit would certainly have some NEGATIVE consequences but your great leader doesn't want to admit that any exist... which is simply lying just to win an argument.

&gt;So you now accept that the UK would be better off tailoring its own regulation, which it needs to be outside the EU to do.

No. Standardisation happens around the world and I am more than certain that GMC doesn't force ANY country to somehow accept education standards automatically, especially when it's obvious they aren't. At the end of the day all still depends on an employer, who if he things a doctor from Bulgaria may not be good enough to work in the UK, he simply won't employ him.

It's exactly like GMC was moaning it can't check level of English language of EU doctors... which was simply a LIE because EU said they don't object and never did to that... and somehow those English checks are being introduced now. So, yeah, another great example showing how often the whole anti-EU agenda works.

&gt;I'm not a nationalist. I'm a patriot.

Yeah... right. Never forget that the line between these is often very thin. I'll tell you how I look as things. Nothing is perfect, absolutely nothing! Constructive discussions are very important. Plenty of things in the EU should be changed. Making however whole campaign and agenda, which is based on purely positives of certain change is just idiotic. Not admitting single positives from current solution is being desperately one sided and as soon as you lean towards borderline of one side, you become a fanatic.

&gt;That was in response to saying that we should recruit, headhunt and buy from those doing something well

And nothing stops UK recruiting people from non-EU countries. Just because EU citizens have ""priority"", it doesn't mean non-EU recruitments fully stops.

&gt;To make the UK better.

It shouldn't be. 

&gt;The fact that the decision was made by a majority nationalist council should tell you that their motivation was obviously not to be more like the UK as you say.

Arguably the Nationalists wanted it taken down full stop. Alliance mediated a (what should have been) reasonable suggestion and since the previously DUP voting constituents had protested by voting for Alliance they had the power to decide. This is how democracy works. People out rioting and wrecking shit because they disagree in the name of culture is ridiculous.

&gt;It was provocative and it provoked a lot of trouble. People obviously felt very strongly about the flag being taken down, much much more strongly than anyone felt about leaving it there, nobody felt intimidated walking past city hall because of it. 

That's not the point. It shouldn't have provoked shit. The fleggers just thought if they threw all their shit out of the pram they could keep their fleg up all year round. 

Nobody felt ""intimidated"" by the flag but there is no reason to fly it more days than other major UK cities especially when this city is individual in that it is the capital of a country/state/province/whatever where there are both Nationalist and Unionist beliefs being represented in government. 

&gt;Wanting the decision to be reversed is in no way bigotry, if anything the decision nationalists made to take it down was the bigoted act.

Fair point, having it taken down altogether would have been as wrong (if not a little bit more wrong) as keeping it up all year round. Alliance made a decision based on what they thought would be best for EVERYONE, not just Unionists nor just Nationalists and look what that got them. The attacks on Alliance were most definitely bigotted.

I have a degree, and obviously was applying for skilled positions, all over the country, but 5 a week is a nonsensical rate, there's only a few dozen realistic companies in my field I could have worked for, and they aren't all always hiring. 

So I had to write down on my JSA card that I was applying for local jobs, all menial stuff like working in local shops, hotels and restaurants. (I was applying, but obviously wasn't pushing very hard to get those jobs). As long as you do that, they won't hassle you about your JSA.

How would you know?  You started by responding to an original post not appreciating that it said could.  You argue at cross purposes with yourself, within the same comment.  You admit to not being able to read perfectly coherent English sentences on occasion (even trying to blame someone else).  You openly contradict yourself.

Switched to a different topic?  I'm referencing the original comment that I made and which you replied to!!!

&gt; In your quote of what I've written I don't say ANYTHING in relation to your suggestion that I want to decrease UK's standards.

You're arguing that it is selfish to want to put the UK first.

&gt;That sentence related to the UNIVERSITIES IN THE UK!!! And I am NOT talking about qualification as qualification is recognised as being on the same level. 

And it was an analogy to standards in the EU.  I pointed out that we can pick and choose universities, even rule them out if we wish.  Yet we don't get that choice with the EU club.  You accept all 28, and there's an ECJ to make sure they're treated equally.

&gt;NO! I did NOT! Standards are NOT reduced, because those standards ALREADY EXIST in EU countries!

Yes you do.   

You even admitted that there should probably be a change to the WTD for the NHS, in connection precisely to what Professor Dalgleish argued that standards are dropping.    

You got in a hissy fit when I used Bulgaria as an example (which has a terrible child mortality rate.)   You openly acknowledge that medical professionals find it easier to roam inside EU, but get angry as soon as an undeveloped example within the EU is used - but still acknowledging an undeveloped country.   

If we put all medical professionals on a visa system then we'd simply just be choosing the best - regardless of where they come from.  

&gt;NO IT WAS NOT - I have absolute right to judge a current situation on CURRENT solution, NOT ""WHAT IF"". 

Too late, you're not taking that back.

I say the UK *COULD* hire whoever it wants by being outside the EU.  Clearly could, and clearly not the current situation (as we were talking about being outside the EU).

You said 'bullshit'.   You then tried to change what I had said to something else, arguing that we were talking would and not could.

You then conceded that there was nothing stopping the UK and they indeed COULD do exactly as I said.

The very first comment.

Britain is also proud (and rightly so) of having a food culture of cakes and biscuits. The ""sugar aisles"" in the supermarkets scare the crap out of me! They're huge, with so many different types of snack food. 

When I lived in Australia, pudding/dessert was a thing you had now and then. Here it seems that people have pudding after every meal! I have free lunches at my work and every single day there is a pudding available. I wouldn't eat sweets every single day because *thar be diabetes!*

I'd expect the same people go home, eat dinner, and probably eat another pudding.

In Australia, I didn't eat a sweet course with my lunch, and certainly not every day.

Then there's the cheap alcohol (major source of calories), and the *super sweet* ciders. Some of the ciders are great, but some of them are just ridiculously sweet. I've noticed that most of my British female friends go for these fruity sweet ciders.  With the effect of noticeable weight gain.

I'm fairly food aware, but I've started putting on weight since I arrived here because it's really hard not to and to avoid the bad food. I certainly found it easier to eat right in Australia than I do in Britain. Maybe it's because in Australia I was living in Sydney, which is similar to London in that it has lots of healthy options available. e.g. sushi as a lunch option. In Britain, I've been living in the smaller towns and the lunch options are a lot less healthy.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;You want a discussion on how many Islamic countries stone people as capital punishment.

Not really, it's already well documented - and it leads to the wider question of how many other preposterous practices are also still in use because a book says so. The Bible may have a horrible history of what's been done in it's name in the past, but the relevance is in what's being done in the name of specific religions *right now*.

It's easy to list nonsense stuff in the Bible asserting that gays, or eating shellfish (etc.) are an abomination, but we can have a laugh about that because nobody in any great numbers takes those things quite so literally anymore - at least, not in numbers to have the law changed to reflect it (although Ireland is still a bit in the stone age with their abortion law).

Therefore the stoning issue/ actual practices are relevant because it can't be reduced to an historical event/ practice in a religious book - change the religion, and it's taken as active encouragement/ divine blessing *in the modern world*. Hence although it's easy to find reference to such things in the bible, it's not as if people are actively taking the bible literally (any more) in a way that will affect/ dictate to everyone regardless - and so we can have Christian countries that *don't* get to stop gay marriage purely because their bible says so. Taking gay marriage as an example, have a look at how well that's working out in Islamic countries.

&gt;The conversation is on books found in a school that promote stoning.

Which is a practice that is still happening, particularly in countries which assert to practice that religion. If that kind of thing was still prevalent in Christian countries, then it would be hypocritical to assert that a different religion was in the wrong for doing the same thing. But it isn't, so it's not.

It's like saying that by doing Brexit, UK ""could"" be again on the same position as it where when it was an Empire. Any sane person would respond to you by saying ""bullshit"".... but then, we could figure out some kind of twisted scenario, that UK could potentially start nuclear war and win over the globe, or join some new organisation with Russia and China and indirectly profit from their bad practice of work or even conquer.

&gt;You're arguing that it is selfish to want to put the UK first

First, under ANY circumstances.

&gt;And it was an analogy to standards in the EU. I pointed out that we can pick and choose universities, even rule them out if we wish. Yet we don't get that choice with the EU club. You accept all 28, and there's an ECJ to make sure they're treated equally.

Incorrect as I doubt education standards, or rather their lack is forced upon the UK by the EU. These are discussed and agreed at completely different level. No requirement from GMC, while requirement from HPC gives you an idea that EU doesn't meddle with it and forces anybody to do anything ridiculous.

&gt;You even admitted that there should probably be a change to the WTD for the NHS, in connection precisely to what Professor Dalgleish argued that standards are dropping.

Working Time Directive is completely different to the ""standards"" you were arguing. In fact, it is meant to actually INCREASE standards of service.

&gt;You got in a hissy fit when I used Bulgaria as an example (which has a terrible child mortality rate.

And why do you suppose that happens? Is it because level of education for doctors is too low in Bulgaria? I don't know details but as I've mentioned to you previously, there are other factors connected with that (remember the road type comparison?). So yeah, just because mortality rate in Bulgaria is higher, probably because they don't put enough money into having enough doctors, enough facilities etc, it doesn't automatically mean that a doctor who finished medical studies in Bulgaria, where those studies were recognised by international body as covering material, teaching methods etc as adequate to be recognised also in the UK, will be of lower standards than British doctor.

I'm sorry, but what you're suggesting is simply.... kind of racist. Just because a country is poor, it doesn't mean it can't have an excellent service in certain sectors, even better than one in rich countries.

&gt;If we put all medical professionals on a visa system then we'd simply just be choosing the best - regardless of where they come from.

But that is already happening!!! If employer doesn't like Bulgarian doctor, just because he is racist, he will not employ him anyway.... and the EU can't force him to employ him (of course unless he starts bragging about why his application was refused based on his perception).",0,1402486193,null,0,false,0,ci4pgtt,t3_27m2id,t1_ci4pgtt,t1_ci4ouqp,null,1434189800,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

While this is true people get overweight easily enough without touching this stuff. There is a huge problem about misleading messages about dieting.

Weight gain or loss is purely about ∆E. This message needs to be drummed into people because they don't believe it. By all means people should be educated that it is easier to lose control of ∆E if you are eating particular foods but it should never be described in terms of good or bad foods in a general sense.

There are various reasons to not do this. Firstly some people simply won't give up their junk food. There are ways to work around junk food in a diet but if you teach them, wrongly, that weight control is impossible without cutting it then they will not bother.

Which isn't to say Britain is worse than any other country.

This whole issue is just pandering to the right, probably UKIP supporters to be perfectly honest.

I don't moderate it, I don't think I make too many what aboutish(if you follow me) comments or posts. If you think it is a persistent problem then you would be better talking to the mods about it as they might be able to do something about it.

 I think your comment about GA being in denial about being a member of the IRA meaning SF can't claim to be a progressive party is interesting. I believe GA was in the IRA(even if he didn't swear an oath or whatever it might be as mentioned in another comment, he was to all intents and purposes a member). I was merely pointing out that the main nationalist party has a very strong stance on extremists within the nationalist movement and pointed out some on the language they use to spin this. The fact that someone like Willie Frazer is being briefed by the DUP prior to the Hass talks obviously shows that a difference stance is taken by the main unionist party. They appear to be trying to deal with them by inviting them into the fold and I don't think that its a good way to do nor do I think that its working. Don't forgot I was commenting on a political article I wasn't just randomly beating the drum for SF. 

I don' think 'the uncomfortable truth' about figures involved in nationalist politics should be ignored. I don't think GA ever physically pulled a trigger in they way MMCG or GK did but I certainly think he was involved in planning these decisions. However none of that is new information and to continue to get hung up on it is not good for the people or the politics of N. Ireland. This breed of politician exists on both sides, but happily as we move on in a peaceful society they will fade away and most people joining politics today will never( I certainly hope) have been active members of a paramilitary organisation. 

If there is a nationalist bias then again thats nothing to do with me.

 [**Transfer window**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer%20window): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __transfer window__ is the period during the year in which a [football club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_club) can [transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(association_football\)) players from other countries into their playing staff. Such a transfer is completed by registering the player into the new club through FIFA. ""Transfer window"" is the unofficial term commonly used by the media for the concept of ""registration period"" as described in the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Player.  According to the rules, each national football association decides on the time (such as the dates) of the 'window' but it may not exceed 12 weeks. The second registration period occurs during the season and may not exceed four weeks.

They would argue that we have immortal souls. If you kill someone with a soul, they are murdered. This applies to fetuses, therefore they should be protected. It is just coincidental that this is a policy that restrains women.

They would argue that homosexuality is a sin and a temptation/addiction you particularly have, and you are damaging your immortal soul by indulging in it. They fight against the acceptance of this sin in order to protect people's souls falling foul of it, like stopping the spread of an STD.

It's just a coincidence that this persecutes difference and reinforces the conservative, breeding patriarchal family-unit structure that they traditionally strengthens their organisations and that they model their theology on (...just a coincidence that they worship God ""the father"" rather than the trans-gender deity of their theology.)

You're very right, that's the major falling point. While it's understandable it shouldn't be acceptable. The failing is mainly due to people not using their time correctly.

Sex is not the problem but her myself and my younger brother all went to the same private schools and I know first hand (being that I'm the eldest) that I came out of primary school (age 11) knowing exactly how sex works and contraception works. She knows too, but the attitude of it can't happen to me prevailed. 

In my mind consequences for actions is far more important than simply demonstrating why a certain action may lead to those consequences. Had she been more disciplined early in life and not doted on and her every whim given into, I feel she would have been better prepared for knowing that unprotected sex + birth control pills you don't use + lack of parental figures reinforcing missed periods is NOT normal = 6 months pregnant without adding up the signs of weight gain, morning sickness and raging hormones. 

I truly don't understand how these basics were forgotten. She's no late bloomer and had her first period at around 10. She knows all the information yet chose to ignore her birth control, condoms or general smart practice of not sleeping with a guy named Merlin who picked you up on a park bench and took you home soon after. It's just basic shit here and it annoys me that excuses are made for why it was not already known by her. Like I said, she had too notch education and good sexual practices were 100% reinforced in the home. What gets me is that my choices to use drugs are exactly that, my choices- however getting pregnant in such a manour- well that's just an unfortunate circumstance for a 21 year old girl. 

Seems pretty broken as far as logic goes. Not trying to make the situation less than it was but I knew the dangers of drugs and did it anyway. I don't expect sympathy for my bad decisions but when others bad decisions lead to a totally different outcome, it makes me question what was really going on in her mind as well as others at the time.

As you eloquently have now stated, we COULD do the things I said outside the EU.

What you had called bullshit you went on to accept.

&gt;As I didn't know exactly what you meant by ""could"" I had a full right to respond in that way as

So rather than asking for a clarification you immediately went on an assumption, and an assertion, with 'Bullshit'.

The problem here was your reading comprehension.     

&gt;First, under ANY circumstances.

We were talking about a specific circumstance, specifically the NHS.   Go back and read again if you must.

&gt;Incorrect as I doubt education standards, or rather their lack is forced upon the UK by the EU. These are discussed and agreed at completely different level. No requirement from GMC, while requirement from HPC gives you an idea that EU doesn't meddle with it and forces anybody to do anything ridiculous.

You do it to yourself.   You say incorrect, based on 'doubt', but don't bother to check.   Here's what the GMC are reported as saying,

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/mar/29/gmc-demands-minimum-standards-eu-doctors

     ""UK medical regulators have demanded minimum standards 
      for doctors' training across all 27 EU member states, 
      saying the present variety of systems could endanger 
      patients and undermine public confidence in healthcare 
      and in the single market in jobs.

      The General Medical Council has called for urgent 
      checks of all national medical qualifications to prevent 
      migrant foreign doctors working outside their own country 
      in health systems they may not understand.

      Lack of information about the nature and content of 
      training in other countries means regulators ""cannot 
      have full confidence in each other's medical training 
      and education"", it says in its response to a European 
      commission review of a 2005 directive that governs 
      automatic recognition of the different systems...

      The GMC's devastating attack is the most outspoken 
      critique yet of the European system which requires 
      states to recognise each other's medical qualifications, 
      meaning that regulators cannot test their competence or 
      language skills, as they can with doctors from other parts 
      of the world.""

So YES, the GMC itself is saying that it can't regulate or maintain the same standards as it can with other doctors coming from outside the EU.

It's only as of this month that they're able to legally test language proficiency!!!  EU Directive actively restricts the GMC from upholding its own higher standards or calling qualifications recognised by the EU into question.  

http://stevebarclay.net/gmc-launches-consultation-following-foreign-doctors-language-testing-campaign/

The Commission even held a consultation with the GMC over their concerns.  An EU Directive is trying to push through a medical e-card for health practitioners to show cross-state qualification and the GMC is concerned about this too:  

     ""We are concerned that the competent authorities 
      in the home member states will find it difficult to 
      cover the increased administrative costs that will 
      result from a shift in responsibility for recognition. 
      Furthermore, it is unclear what incentives sending 
      member states will have to assess the documentation 
      at the point of departure with the same rigour as the 
      host competent authority, especially in light of the 
      tight deadlines proposed.

      Under the current system we receive documents 
      issued by the home member state in error and without 
      due care from time to time. The increased pressure on 
      home member states could increase this risk of error and 
      put patients and the public in the host member state at 
      risk unnecessarily.""

The GMC is saying that they're having standards foisted upon them, and they're concerned about the diligence of other member countries to keep to the same high standards, or even their ability to process the administration and accurately present the information.  That they're effectively rubberstamping qualifications that they must recognise and it is putting NHS patients at risk!

http://www.gmc-uk.org/GMC_response_to_EC_consultation_on_European_professional_card_54844518.pdf

They're desperately trying to get a decent *minimum* standard, even knowing that they already have an above average standard, to actively stop the rot coming from within the EU.   As a regulator the GMC is not restricted when it comes to vetting those coming in with a visa.

&gt;Working Time Directive is completely different to the ""standards"" you were arguing. In fact, it is meant to actually INCREASE standards of service.

I gave a link to a video to argue the case for the standards.  It was an NHS professor, and he very much spoke about the Working Time Directive.    [I linked to the video straight as soon as we started talking about the Working Time Directive.](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/27m2id/in_support_of_the_nhs_and_eu/ci3s1nq)

The WTD may have been introduced with the best of intentions but it has not only failed to improve, it has and is proving disastrous for standards.

The Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons have both warned against the way the Working Time Directive is having a disastrous impact on standards:  

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/9607646/EU-working-time-rules-put-patients-at-risk-warn-doctors.html

So don't say it was different to what we were arguing when you've nt watched the video in the comment you were responding too!

&gt;And why do you suppose that happens? Is it because level of education for doctors is too low in Bulgaria? I don't know details but as I've mentioned to you previously, there are other factors connected with that (remember the road type comparison?). So yeah, just because mortality rate in Bulgaria is higher, probably because they don't put enough money into having enough doctors, enough facilities etc, it doesn't automatically mean that a doctor who finished medical studies in Bulgaria, where those studies were recognised by international body as covering material, teaching methods etc as adequate to be recognised also in the UK, will be of lower standards than British doctor.

Then speak to the GMC, because the argument that you doubted they're actually the ones desperately arguing when in consultation with the Commission...and this issue already has happened, is happening.  It's why they're trying to bring in these new e-cards, but the GMC is saying that they're flawed and specifically expressing concerns with the poorer countries.

&gt;But that is already happening!!! If employer doesn't like Bulgarian doctor, just because he is racist, he will not employ him anyway.

Yet the GMC are saying as a regulator the 2005 Health Directive is tying their hands behind their backs.   That the 'Good Clinical Practice Directive' is actually watering down UK standards and limiting what they can and can't do.

I would simply try and find the savings account with the best rate.

You could take on some risk with some investments but you will be opening yourself up to potential loss. I would suggest that you do not invest in things that you don't understand until you have some money you are happy to lose.

I would think about a secondary income. A paying hobby or 2nd job. Can you make anything or tutor anything? Any sellable skills? Dog-walking/baby sitting is great if you can get it, house sitting even more so.

The value/frugal mindset can be amazing when you get into it. When you know what your time is worth then you know what is and isn't worth your free time

Little frugal things like selling your old crap (and other crap) on ebay can do surprisingly well. Getting another year out of your phone/laptop/desktop/tv. Walking instead of paid transport (I take taxis approximately 1/40th as much as my friends, and exclusively drunk or extremely tired). Do get a credit card but don't ever use it for credit (any debt/credit except student loans is viscous IMO), pay off the balance every month and collect the rewards.

Religious groups inevitably bend the religious teachings they have inherited into an excuse for their socio-political and cultural leanings.

Right-wing Christians are Patriarchal groups, and justify this through the teachings of the Old testament Patriarchs and Paul.

Quakers are pacifists at heart and justify this with some of Jesus' teachings.

Jehovah's Witnesses are millennials who justify their teachings with many of Jesus' and those of the early church.

The same applies to politics. Dedicated Socialists celebrate freedoms until they are in power and fear losing it. Dedicated Fiscal Liberals celebrate state non-intervention until it threatens to up-end the system. Dedicated Social conservatives celebrate the family unit and traditions until they want to indulge themselves or find out that their son is Gay. Fiscally Progressive young graduates are all in favour of high taxes until they enter the earning middle class and find that they're paying.

Humans use ideology as a justification for their urges or interests far more than they use it to inform their lives.

Giving LFC an ultimatum is also evidence of this. I think loaning him out to a premiership club nxt season would be best for him and Liverpool but he seems to have his own ideas and demands now.

It's not even about talent. He accomplished more than Ronaldo. Where's Ronaldo's World Cup? 

Get some perspective. Messi plays with half of the World champion Spanish team. What has he done with Argentina. ""Club accomlishments"" have only really become popular in the last 20 years. 

If they can't do it at international level, they won't be remembered as one of the greatest.

Republicanism on the other hand has the goal of a United Ireland. Again I think this is inevitable in the next few centuries.

For me it's important.

(I'd love to hear what a psychologist would make of that game btw :|)

A lot of people say it should be left to parents, but how can parents educate their kids on LGBT people when they had no education themselves? The thing that helped my internal homophobia more than anything was education; reading studies and learning about it. 

I think before homophobia can be stopped in this country, we have to start teaching the facts, because otherwise parents fill their kids heads with their own 1950s recycled prejudices and the cycle continues. Nobody bothers to take the time to learn more themselves as adults, what straight person would spend 20 minutes on google learning about something that doesn't apply to them? How many straight people here have taken the time to learn about this?

We're a progressive club by English standards, especially now with Poch at the helm, and Lennon is a very traditional player. I've no doubt Poch will prefer Lamela and Townsend on the right, and rightly so considering they each arguably have more impact and are five years younger. I think the time has finally come for the club and Lennon to go their separate ways amicably, for each of their sakes.

For instance; most people currently can't seem capable of comprehending that in urban centres a bicycle is much quicker and convenient than a car most of the time. Instead of building more capacity for cars, we should change the way people travel.

Follow this by presumed liability, as discussed in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/27vfg5/an_open_discussion_about_our_transport_systems/ci4r72e), and we have a structure to improve attitude on our public road network.

Public transport is incredibly lacklustre. Buses in most of the country are OK, in rural areas they're manageable at best where they exist. The train network is awful; we pay through the nose for the privilege of using overcrowded, often late or cancelled. It's too easy to cancel a train.

true,Robware,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire East,"Helmets and high-vis have been put on a pedestal by a lot of people. In actuality they do little to improve safety.

Helmets are designed to work in impacts up to 12MPH and only protect the head from impact injury up to that point. They don't assist in preventing rotational injuries or whiplash, and in some cases can cause them. 12MPH is the total impact speed between all involved parties. 12MPH is a slow cyclist hitting the floor. A helmet won't help much in a multi-vehicular collision, and won't do anything against an HGV (which is largest contributor to cyclist fatalities). Helmets are inadequate for general road use.

As for high-vis; during the day you should be aware enough of your surroundings to be able to identify objects without a fluorescent coating. Most objects don't have a high visibility colour scheme. During night they're useless as fluorescent colours rely in reflecting ultraviolet as visible light to appear brighter, and artificial lighting doesn't emit any ultraviolet light. Reflectives are key at night, but they only work when the viewer is directly behind the light beam being reflected. [Take a look for yourself](http://www.croydoncyclist.co.uk/how-reflective-clothing-works/).

Your experience probably not only comes from confirmation bias, you likely don't notice the good ones, but also the fact that driving is a privilege. A license is required, and you have to work for it. You also need to be able to afford and qualify for insurance. Everyone has equal rights to use the road by what ever means, and a bicycle is much easier to get a hold of as a fast mode of transport, so you're more likely to find people who don't quite understand how to safely use the road network.

90% diet, 10% exercise.. Not even joking. 

I'd say that the single biggest cause of rising obesity is people thinking they need to exercise to lose the weight. It's been wheeled out on every lunch time TV show for god knows how long. 

The misconception that 'You must diet and exercise more..'

Why bundle two things that people almost instinctively hate? Remove the biggest barrier to entry (exercise) and keep the easiest one to accomplish (diet).. 

Another problem is people thinking they can quick fix being fat. You can't. 

People say a diet won't work, and they're completely correct. A diet won't work. Changing your diet, however, will work. That means a permanent change. 

If I claimed I showered two weeks ago and now I smell, therefore showers don't work then people would look at me like I was fucking insane. 

They don't seem to understand that it requires a lifestyle change and it might suck in the short term but it's really not that hard in the long term. 

tl;dr telling people to exercise is counter productive when it comes to getting them to lose fat. Stress diet instead. It's the easier of the two to do.

true,pharao007,null,null,"&gt;It was obvious to everyone else what COULD means, you just clearly misread it as WOULD, and argued along those lines.

Your ""could"", without clarification under what circumstances meant ""would"" to me as I'm not in your head and don't know what kind of plan for that to happen you have prepared. You could have replied to that ""bullshit"" in the first post by clarifying that NHS would have to pump in quite a lot of money, so again, it would totally change the whole situation, making my response perfectly fine. You've actually said *We simply recruit.* so basically lied to what possible negatives of such change would be.

&gt;So YES, the GMC itself is saying that it can't regulate or maintain the same standards as it can with other doctors coming from outside the EU.

GMC and the rest is overreacting on that one case which simply had a ""bad"" doctor included, exactly like when British educated doctors are struck of because of some similar reasons. Medical qualifications in the EU were recognised by a panel of specialists and in connection with the GMC. Of course, GMC could argue and use some silly examples for ""lack"" of training as it's simply easier to have UK educated person to work here, as there will always be some form of adaptation.

&gt;It's only as of this month that they're able to legally test language proficiency!!!

The EU didn't forbid them doing it in the past. It was GMC's - *Until now, Britain has interpreted EU law as meaning that doctors who qualify in any of the 27 countries must be free to work elsewhere, without restriction.*

&gt;They're desperately trying to get a decent minimum standard, even knowing that they already have an above average standard, to actively stop the rot coming from within the EU.

Yet, the highest struck number of doctors comes from.... India. There are 25k doctors from the EU, yet none from the EU are in the ""top 5"" of struck off... with a remark of 27 cases of struck off doctors from whole Eastern Europe (of how many isn't provided and I couldn't find that data).

So basically, what we have here is you arguing that doctors from the EU should be treated exactly the same as doctors from no-EU countries, as this would increase standards, yet it is some non-EU countries which have highest number of struck off doctors, not the ones from the EU.

To me this is an non-issue discussion, especially knowing that nothing stops UK in introducing further local checks, what has been done with revalidation or some induction programmes. The fact is that UK can very well increase standards if it has any doubts of qualifications in the EU, in many different ways, but somehow even current changes were done because of a single one or two examples of EU doctors being in wrong.

If something, there should be a question why so many non-EU doctors have such high number of struck off, showing that current ""great"" system you propose to have for EU nationals.... doesn't even work to the ""standard"" required in the UK.

&gt;So don't say it was different to what we were arguing when you've nt watched the video in the comment you were responding too!

I rarely ever listen to video links but in any case knew that there will always be someone complaining about something. I know that WTD may not be ideal but the opposite of working unrestricted hours may be even worse. Using arguments that it would be better for patients to see familiar face...... does his 60th hours of work in a hospital is just idiotic. I'm surprised that even such professionals want to argue with that limit on hours but at first they want to indicate to current problem which should be somehow reduced but not necessarily by removing the WTD.

&gt;Yet the GMC are saying as a regulator the 2005 Health Directive is tying their hands behind their backs. That the 'Good Clinical Practice Directive' is actually watering down UK standards and limiting what they can and can't do

I don't see anything wrong with GMC trying to increase those standards throughout whole EU... but as it currently stands, they don't even have a good case (apart of that German doctor, which case I find irrelevant to the whole panic) where they can base their fear on and at the same time they fail in keeping standards with doctors with whom they have full power of control.",0,1402499386,null,0,false,0,ci4tpxg,t3_27m2id,t1_ci4tpxg,t1_ci4q5ln,null,1434191804,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It always amuses me when people suggest firearms should only be stored at a range.

Yet if we all had to store our firearms at a range we might as well just leave the doors unlocked. Any range storing firearms would be broken into within a matter of weeks, if not days. 

Im not sure what benefit storing firearms at a range has given security is far greater in a regulated, inspected home (as all the homes of British firearm owners are). It would seem to me that giving the general public a false sense of security is the only real purpose?

And also correct.

&gt; but it's been seem that removal of parking and motor vehicle access has actually boosted the high street. I believe the big one was New York, where they made a massive pedestrian area where a large multi-lane road used to be, and people flocked to the new area.

Because it's shiny and new people will go there.  This has always been the case and it's largely human nature.  However in the high street you don't just want people wandering around, you want customers buying stuff. 

&gt; They can use a bus, 

Which has limited storage space for bags of shopping beyond the first 4 or 5 people.

&gt; or a bike, 

Which has less cargo capacity than the bus does. 

&gt; or a trolley, 

Which just locked its wheels as you tried removing it from that store.  

&gt; Or they could just opt to carry it like a normal human being.

Not everything you can or indeed could buy in the high street lends itself to being carried a great distance by hand.  

&gt; Now before you mention grocery shopping; most of those are out of town with their own dedicated car parks.

Most notably, it overlooked the fact that someone who's going to disregard the law about not murdering people probably isn't going to care about the law 'preventing' them from owning handguns. 

Just look at the number of homicides involving firearms since the ban in 1997 ([page 11](http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn01940.pdf)). Clearly the handgun ban has had absolutely no effect.

true,w0ss4g3,cnty-wales,Not Welsh but I live here,"But I do get blamed, I regularly get people having a go at me when I've done nothing illegal or stupid (I follow the rules and I have lights and reflective clothing). The typical bollocks is about jumping red lights and cycling on the pavement, usually accompanied by the words ""You lot"".

I cycle a lot, I also drive and I observe equal proportions of stupidity from drivers and cyclists. However, the drivers are in control of a 1+ tonne metal object and are meant to have been qualified to be in control of it. Focusing on cyclists doing this and that doesn't get to the root of the problem. The truth is that the mentality of this country is that the car (namely the one I'm sitting in) is in control of the road and fuck everything (namely everyone) else. Until the majority of car drivers attitudes change to accommodate other road users and road planning actually reflects it too, nothing will change.

I agree that cycle training should be made more visible and available to everyone - I doubt many people have even heard of Bike-Ability or the various local schemes (e.g. From my local council, there's 3 sets of progressive free one hour session available to anyone who books it). These should be pushed into view for anyone who's just getting started, particularly those who've not ridden for years and think it's a good idea to go up the inside of a bus/HGV.. something I see on an alarmingly regular basis.

However, awareness of other roads users (e.g. cyclists, horses, etc) should be included more into driver training. The thing is, the majority of idiotic driving I see is done by middle-aged people who passed their test a good 10-20 years ago. There is almost no helping these people because they will never be re-educated unless something drastically changes.

EDIT: apologies for the long rant, but this is something I'm quite passionate about.

&gt;  where did I say there could only be 11 world class players? Oh yeah, I didn't

Here is what you said: 

&gt; World class means players who could walk into any team and demand a starting role.

So, tell me then - how many goal keepers can walk into any team in the world? Only one obviously, because there is only one best GK in the world and he is the only person who can walk into his current team. How many defenders can walk into any team in the world? Four obviously, as the 5th best defender couldn't walk into a team which contained the four best. Etc.

For example: a bike can carry as much as you want. That's the beauty of bikes. You can get them with trailers, with long rear racks, with rear and front racks, [with a large front tray](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=cargo+bike&amp;safe=off&amp;hl=en&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=B3qYU7OaGaLE7AaQzIHQBg&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1066&amp;bih=630). It really is what you make of it. I can carry much more on my bike than I can on a bus. I can also wheel my bike right up to my cupboards, should I want, and not bear any weight at all.

My trolley example was only semi-serious, but there are more trolleys than you find at a supermarket. The most commonly seen type would be the ones typically used by OAPs. But really, [look at the range of types](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=trolley&amp;safe=off&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=Pw6&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1HaYU7-0OoSp7AbNqIDwBQ&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1066&amp;bih=630).

As for my carrying statement, that was also a bit of mockery. You see people walk around carrying their loot all the time. Just go in to town during Christmas. Hell, look at the Trafford centre: 3 floors and 3 miles of shops. You think people keep going back to the car after every shop visit? Sure maybe you get something really big and heavy, but in this day and age you can almost always arrange a delivery if nothing else.

Some people predict doom and gloom when their dependency on motor vehicles is put in to question at the prospect of keeping them out of towns. But what tends to happen is that the general populace is happy to be able to walk around without having to worry about some 2 tonne metal beast running them down.",0,1402501789,null,0,false,0,ci4utit,t3_27vfg5,t1_ci4utit,t1_ci4u0pq,null,1434192323,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

And all the big stores you could probably rattle off that supply such things... have large online presences and will delivery.   Even the ""small indie traders"" people seem to be enamoured with are online now; often selling via ebay, estsy or Amazon if not having their own dedicated web presence.

*nods* And I shall reply to it in that vein.

&gt; the Christian church has been running schools for a very long time.

They also used to run hospitals to a great extent. However, times change, knowledge/learning/skills etc. move on and there is no fundamental reason as to why churches should be allowed to do either any longer. With the hospital example this is somewhat clearer - with schools people seem to have a blind spot. But it's even more apparent that they shouldn't do so when the majority of the population do not belong to that religion and/or do not practice that religion. To an extent that acknowledges the issue of whether or not the state should take a hand in forcing religion on children.

&gt; They are running a more or less secular school. 

And so there is no reason to have the vicar 'running the show' or the church council have undue influence. (by the by, to add to the conversation, [no publicly funded school in the UK is truly secular](https://humanism.org.uk/education/parents/collective-worship-and-school-assemblies-your-rights/)).

&gt; But they have been running the school for 200 years, they own the building, they employ the staff, . 

To an extent this is a section the [""...we're a Christian country because...""](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/27ojwo/ann_widdecombe_says_difficult_to_do_christianity/ci3fmqj) loop I always end up mentioning on a thread like this. They might employ the staff, but they don't pay their wages (afaik). Incidentally the staff they employ can be discriminated (e.g. no gays) against under the exemptions given to religious groups under the Equality Act 2010.     
And they own the buildings? I'm pretty sure that's not the case for most - or if it is then it wasn't (Church) 'private' money that went to pay for it. Some older buildings, perhaps, but even then I would say likely most were paid for through local or national taxation, even back in the day. That's something to look into, actually.

&gt; they get some money from the government

""Some""? I was under the impression it's pretty much all, particularly given the continued claim that the CoE doesn't have any cash to hand to repair buildings and the like.

&gt; It's just what they do.

That sounds rather defeatist. It seems to imply that such groups are never to be challenged regarding their roles and influence. 

&gt; What are they just going to give up? Why would they? It is just inertia.

I'm more of an advocate for the removal of power and influence from such institutions without asking, really.

If you know the type of company you want to work for, just start trawling through their websites/careers pages. www.milkround.com can be useful for finding internships and placements, so maybe give that a go.
