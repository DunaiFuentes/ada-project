Giving our inexperienced DM less space to cover and decisions to make. Again in the Villa game Gerrard was running around chasing shadows as we were so open, he doesnt read those situations as well as Lucas. Now he sits in a defined area with other players covering him.

Lack of a genuine third CM to press high up the pitch. Coutinho works hard but sometimes opponents just run straight through him.

Sturridge's lack of pressing game and general lack of involvement off the ball, and preference for running onto through passes on the counter.

As I don't have enough national insurance contributions and I live with my girlfriend, the Job Centre told me that in order to apply for Job Seeker's allowance that I needed to submit information about both of our incomes, not just my own (Despite the fact my partner is in full time education doing a Masters degree and therefore is not seeking work). This is a rule designed to prevent one partner claiming whilst the other is in full time work, which is perfectly understandeable; if they are living together they should share a combined income. But the unintended consequence meant that I could not claim just for myself, we had to claim as a couple, meaning we effectively get double what I asked for.

It's been bounced back and forth to 3-4 different decision makers (On my own request) and apparently it's ok.

Before I talk about Hendo, I want to say that before I even looked at the title of the post, I knew that it would be something negative about LFC. Why did I know? Because for me, /u/rztzz has a -5 next him. Now I don't usually down vote on this subreddit because I value reasonable/diverse input on our subreddit; however, I do consistently down vote those that I think provide unreasonable/unnecessary views. The -5 tells the whole story for me; check out his posts/comments for yourself. Now let me defend Hendo:

I'll be honest upfront; I think Hendo has a lot of potential, energy and desire. The only thing he lacks is consistency...and I honestly think that boils down to the inconsistency regarding where he's played and the amount that he's actually played.

First, BR has played him at Right Wing, Right Wingback, CAM, CM, and CDM during the course of the season. That's way too many positions to let a young player develop but unfortunately that's necessary given our lack of depth


Second, he has the most appearances (27 starts and 1 Sub) with Skrtel, second place outfield player, having 24 starts and 0 subs. He's played way too many minutes this season and that's starting to affect his performance. 

For me, Henderson looked spent yesterday. He hasn't been rotated enough and that's because he's our most consistent and reliable CM. I think he could evolve into a perfect performer for us. I posted this in a previous discussion, ""In the 2003/04 season, Gerrard at the age of 23/4 had 7 goals and 7 assists from 49 appearances. Henderson, this season at the age of 23/4, has 2 goals and 6 assists from 24 appearances. Now I'm not saying that Henderson is comparable to Gerrard in overall impact on the pitch but I think he has the potential to be and the statistics support that.""",0,1391497954,null,0,false,0,cf6mmzb,t3_1wwyly,t1_cf6mmzb,t1_cf641mv,null,1432244899,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Thyrotoxic,cnty-wales,Not actually Welsh,"Hitler wasn't a socialist and working Nazi ideology when they ascended to power had nothing to do with socialism. He had the communist and socialist deputies arrested before the enabling act was signed. He also murdered the main radical leaders, who took the socialist and workers part of the NSDAP seriously, such as the Strasser brothers and Ernst Rohm in 1934. 

There's not only that but Hitler's reaction towards popular labour movements and private business are the complete opposition to socialism. 

&gt;""On Monday, 20 February 1933, at 6.00 p.m., a group of about twenty five businessmen were summoned to attend a private meeting in the villa of Hermann Goering, now acting as president of the Reichstag, at which Hitler, the Reich Chancellor, was to 'explain his policies'. The guests were an oddly assorted bunch. The invitees included leaders of German industry, men such as Georg von Schnitzler, second in command at IG Farben, Krupp von Bohlen, who was both head-by-marriage of the Krupp empire and the current chairman of the Reich industrial association, and Dr Albert Voegler the CEO of the Vereinigte Stahlwerke, the world's second largest steel firm...

&gt;Hitler..launched into a general survey of the political situation...the experience of the last fourteen years had shown that 'private enterprise cannot be maintained in the age of democracy'. Business was founded above all on the principles of personality and individual leadership.Democracy and liberalism led inevitably to Social Democracy and Communism...[the NSDAP] would show no mercy towards [its] enemies on the left. It was time 'to crush the other side completely'...

&gt;[Hitler] planned to crush the German left and in the process he was more than willing to use physical force. At least according to the surviving record, the conflict between left and right was the central theme of the speeches by both Hitler and Goering on 20 February...Since German business had a major stake in the struggle against the left, it should make an appropriate financial contribution. 'The sacrifice[s]', Goering pointed out, 'would be so much easier...to bear if it [industry] realized that the election of 5 March will surely be the last one for the next ten years, probably even for the next hundred years.'

&gt;Over the following three weeks [the NSDAP] received contributions from seventeen different business groups. The largest individual donations came from IG Farben (400,000 Reichsmarks) and the Deutsche Bank (200,000 Reichsmarks). The association of the mining industry also made a generous deposit of 400,000 Reichsmarks. Other large donors included the organizers of the Berlin Automobile Exhibition (100,000 Reichsmarks) and a cluster of electrical engineering corporations including Telefunken, AEG and the Accumulatoren Fabrik...it was the donations in February and March 1933 that really made the difference. They provided a large cash injection at a moment when the party was severely short of funds and faced, as Goering had predicted, the last competitive election in its history.

&gt;[T]he net effect, by the end of 1934, was precisely as intended: a comprehensive popular demobilization. The contrast with the German political scene ten years before was stark. The labour movement was destroyed...[L]eaders of German business thrived in this authoritarian atmosphere. In the sphere of their own firms they were now the undisputed leaders, empowered as such by the national labour law of 1934. Owners and managers alike bought enthusiastically into the rhetoric of Fuehrertum. It meshed all too neatly with the concept of Unternehmertum (entrepreneurial leadership) that had become increasingly fashionable in business circles, as an ideological counterpoint to the interventionist tendencies of trade unions and the Weimar welfare state.

&gt;In material terms, the consequences of demobilization made themselves felt in a shift in bargaining power in the workplace. In effect, the new regime froze wages and salaries at the level they had reached by the summer of 1933 and placed any future adjustment in the hands of regional trustees of labour...this [can be] taken as an unambiguous expression of business power, since the nominal wage levels prevailing after 1933 were far lower than those in 1929.""

Even if everything had gone right we would have struggled to win this. We need to accept we're going to lose sometimes even in the modern era. They aren't Stockport, it's OK to lose to teams of that calibre from time to time.

1. Injuries. We're missing Fernandinho in mid-field and Aguero up-front

1. Demichelis is iffy at the best of times. Pushing him forward into a position he hates playing against that midfield? No. Milner please.

1. Complacency. Yaya needs to understand he needs a different mental attitude when playing Chelsea to when he's playing Watford. Negredo got subbed(!) and Dzeko's work-rate was not what I expected it to be.

1. The attack had a bad night. Because Chelsea were getting behind the ball so quickly we knew when the ball came to us we had one touch at best so everybody was rushing. We seem to struggle when working under closed down pressure, and that was part of Chelsea's plan. Other teams will now be watching with interest.

1. We lost our cool. The pace of the game was high. The work-rate was high. It must have been exhausting, frustrating and at times confusing. Chelsea wore us down and we came apart a little bit.

All of this is OK, it can be dealt with. We've come a long way from worrying about relegation at this point in the season, so let's take positives: it was an amazing game to watch (painful for me at times), and we were going to lose a game at the Etihad eventually.

- As wingers, Lennon/Chadli/Townsend/Siggy haven't been producing much for us. (to be fair, Townsend is a question mark since we haven't been able to see him much on the left). This formation instead brings our two best wide players into that role instead.

- On the topic of wingbacks, a 3-5-2 is well suited for wingbacks that are great on the attack but sometimes iffy on defense

- Lets us use three of our great CB's, and gives us an extra man against a 4-4-2 (a favorite tactic of Bielsa, also very successful against Spain in Euro 2012). 4-4-2 and 4-4-1-1 are becoming increasingly common in the top teams lately, particularly the ones we struggle against (Liverpool, City, etc)

**Cons**

- Defense is more exposed on the flanks, and the danger involved when they're pulled out of position is greater.

- This relies on a central CB that's dominant in the air and great positioning and movement. Dawson might fit this mold positioning-wise, but there's still a liability with his speed. If Kaboul was back, he'd be perfect for this. Caulker also sounds good for this, if we (hopefully) have a buyback claus.

Why play three CBs when we only have four and Kaboul isn't reliable anymore (in terms of health)? Also, Rose and Walker are not wingers, despite their speed. Walker is definitely a RB and while Rose is barely a LB at times, he not nearly as good as other options as a winger. I'd rather put Townsend, Chadli, Sigurdsson, Eriksen, Lamela or Lennon there (keep in mind that Lamela and Lennon are basically useless there). Rose only gets so much space because he is coming in from deep, uses his speed and often has the player in front of him drifting into the middle. 

I don't think we'd actually use Lamela as a forward either. More like an attacking midfielder positioned off of the striker. 

As for the overall idea of a 3 back formation, it would never work in the Premier League. It's just too fast here and is susceptible of getting caught out. Not to mention it takes away too many spots from the midfield, which is our deepest and best position.

- The school can probably claim more money from the government based on the more students they have requiring a free school meal. The government is providing free school meals for everybody in those age groups but you don't **have** to have the free school meal. However it is in the schools interest for your child to do so. I imagine that extra money then doesn't necessarily all have to be spent on the food/catering and can be cleverly moved around the school budget for something else. 

- They're cutting the desserts/treats out now and making it seem normal for when your child isn't offered one after the Summer as part of the free school meal package. This is because desserts and treats are expensive but they'll do it under the guise of healthy eating. If they are offered a dessert, which I think will be unlikely, it will be just 1 small item per child to keep costs down. 

Clarification on point 1: The government aren't banning packed lunches for these age groups.

Edit 2: 20 mins, no email yet. Also closed the web page by accident, so I don't have the confirmation code to check the status. I can't go to the shop without the email, so either way I'm just waiting. 

Edit 3: no email, have resubmitted two more orders and had no confirmation email. Coming up to one hour. Also dosnt work with ghostery browser, I used chrome iOS. 
Noticed some things on resubmit- asks for country twice, and the birthdate is not uk format ( asks for yyyy-mm-dd which is fine but isn't obvious and didn't flag my error ). 

Edit 4: given up. No emails, status is pending and jammed. Dosnt work! Maybe the shops I selected don't know about it, in which case I'd rather I wasn't pointed in their direction. Very disappointed. I'll update this if I hear any further news but I'd be interested to know if anyone gets any joy in their local shops. 

Edit 5: progress! The system doesn't like hotmail. Switched to another and now waiting for ID approval.

Equally as awful, appointment letters don't arrive until after your stated appointment, and even then I'm receiving 4 other peoples mails to my address from them, and they don't care. In fact, they even tried to get me sanctioned 2 weeks ago and I'm still waiting on hearing back from the decision maker. 

This could render me homeless by a week today, and yet they refused to let me make my case in person, it all had to be via mail to a decision maker that lives on the other end of the country, 

It's ridiculous. Avanta also got me to attend a work trial for some commission based sales company twice in the space of 2 weeks. Now, my first work trial went amazing I thought. I managed to get a confirmed appointment for a new boiler after cold calling for only 2 hours. I've done sales before, that's not easy considering half of the time is spent receiving abuse from those that have paid not to receive such calls.

But yeah, 15 of us attended those work trials, none of us even got offered a one on one with management, it was basically you go in, they give you sheets of numbers, and you're there for 8 hours not talking to anybody else that works for the company.

Just last week I went to my Avanta appointment and they tried putting me on a 2 week, full time course for the same employer. The course was introduced by our Avanta branch manager, whose first words out of his mouth were ""I know you might have heard bad things about Mainframe (the cold calling company), but things have changed in the past 12 months.""

I feel utterly sorry for everyone that stayed on that course (I managed to get out of it after explaining I was there twice only last month). 

It's a fucking sham. Commision work without a minimum wage should not be forced onto those that don't want it, if any of those people go a week or two without managing to make some decent sales (which is going to be most of them), they're going to have to explain themselves to the job centre why they no longer have that job, and you can almost guarantee that they'll have a hard time signing back on so quickly.

in a 3-5-2 the job of the fullbacks is MASSIVE. they have to continually go up and down the wing much more then with 4 at the back. they have to be supreme at going forward or else the play will just get congested. our fullbacks aren't good enough to give quality delivery. if we had someone like baines/shaw then maybe, but walker and rose, definitely not. they struggle enough as it is with only the responsibility as a fullback, let alone the entire flank.

no team has had sustained success with a 3-5-2. wigan had a small degree of success with it a few years ago under martinez but they soon stopped that. tell me why no team (bar Juve's Conte) is using a 3-5-2? Napoli tried it, but quickly reverted back to a back 4 under Benitez. Rodgers tried it for a few games at the start of the season and they had good results, but he's back to the trusted 4 at the back cause that's the way the premier league is accustomed to. not to mention our players have never played in a back 3/5 before, so yeah let's start a whole new learning curve for the defence, who are struggling enough as it is.

PL pitches are big. on a wide pitch, 3 defenders is not enough. you get exposed in the wide areas. the wing backs have a thankless task - expecting them to cover the whole flanks alone is an impossible job.

oh yeah, when a team is under the cosh, 3 at the back very quickly becomes 5, leaving the 3 in midfields to be overwhelmed by the other teams 5, leaving the 2 upfront isolated.

it's a terrible formation to use up against a team that uses width, and guess what? most PL teams love using width exploiting teams down the channels. a back three with wingbacks is a defensive formation designed to combat teams who a) play narrow and b) play with 2 out-and-out frontmen. most of our opponents in the PL do not play this sort of way.",1,1391510081,null,0,false,0,cf6oqre,t3_1wz0wr,t1_cf6oqre,t1_cf6ocri,null,1432245890,-1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,-1

After the camera was turned off, 08076 David Kehoe breaks camera strap in order to seize camera from lawful observer. Because of advanced storage technology, the video data was stored by the device to be recovered when the camera was eventually returned on 31st January 2014. Uniformed hired thug for IGAS David Kehoe blatantly lies about what is said, even though there is a camera pointed at him recording his lies.

* The protester gives no explanation for how he could be at the location without driving such as 'my friend drove me' or 'I've been here all day/night'. He also does not answer the question about his car's location. Obviously he is perfectly entitled to not answer these questions but it certainly adds weight to the police's suspicion.

My grandma bought her council house, but if she hadn't, she'd be entitled to live in a 3 bed house at the taxpayers expense as a pensioner. She's lived there by herself for 13 years (since my grandad died).

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"I think it's a totally valid option.  Juventus play this regularly (although they have better players in nearly every position across the park), and it works terrifically well for them.

The thing is, because you can get exposed out wide by opposition wingers, you really need the midfield three to work very hard to contain play.  They need to press, hassle and harry, not allowing many easy out balls out wide or over the top.  Pogba and Vidal are tailor-made for this kind of play because they are quick, physical but also technically very good.  They are great all rounders, and constantly get into goalscoring positions themselves.  I don't know if we have any midfielders who can do all that.  Paulinho is probably the closest, but I think his passing needs some work in the EPL.  Eriksen is supremely gifted, but high pressing is not in his wheelhouse.

Your two wide men need to do a lot of tracking back and forth.  Rose and Walker definitely have the pace and stamina for it, but I don't think Rose is technically good enough for the role.  He needs to be able to take men on, play quick one-twos, and generally be an attacking threat.  I think Rose is only very modestly gifted at both attacking and defending, not good enough at either to be entrusted with running a whole wing.  A better LB could do this though.

Finally, key to Juve's use of this formation is Pirlo - a deep distributor with immaculate positioning, passing and good with the ball in tight situations.  Again, we don't have anyone in this mould.  I think Sherwood probably sees Bentaleb as someone who can do this, but he's too young and inexperienced to be gifted that position.

&gt;**Tomintoul** ( listen (help·info); from [Scottish Gaelic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language): Tom an t-Sabhail meaning Hillock of the Barn) is a village in the [Moray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moray) [council area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdivisions_of_Scotland) of [Scotland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland); [until 1975](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Scotland) it was in the county of [Banffshire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banffshire).

&gt;It is said to be the highest village in the [Scottish Highlands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_Scotland), but at 345 m (1,132 ft) is still much lower than the highest village in Scotland ([Wanlockhead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanlockhead), in [Dumfries and Galloway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumfries_and_Galloway)).

As it stands the majority of children have packed lunches, of which, only 1% meet the nutritional requirements laid out for school meals. 

You argue that 'the government' is incapable of doing the job properly.

I argue that given that the majority of children are eating pack lunches and that 30% of children aged 2-15 year olds are overweight [(source)](http://www.noo.org.uk/NOO_about_obesity/child_obesity/UK_prevalence) that perhaps parents are not doing it all that  well themselves. 

Perhaps it is high time that the government did interject and ensure that children receive at least one healthy, nutritionally sounds meal a day.

I think our famous fickleness is coming out and Spurs supporters are getting personal and chippy with one another. It is pretty sad. The whole tone of the sub has changed IMO.

As for Bentaleb, I think he's played incredibly well and composed for a 19 year old in the Prem. He's excellent on the ball and rarely plays a bad pass. He is playing the retainer role in midfield incredibly well. Tim loves to dominate possession. Possession based systems almost always rely on someone with good positional sense to play slightly deeper and be a constant outlet to retain possession. Bentaleb has done incredibly well and has looked poised on the ball for someone playing in such a tough league at such a young age. Where he currently needs to improve is in his reading of the game and with that he needs to improve his tackling. He doesn't have to be purely a destroyer, but he needs to win ~66% of his ground 50/50 duels and improve his aerial dueling ability. The only way that he is going to do that is by playing. These past few weeks have been great for him. He should continue to play in my opinion, especially given the not so often spoken of central mid mini injury crisis we had with Sandro, Dembele, Paulinho and even Capoue all who were out for a little while. I'm not suggesting that Bentaleb should start over the likes of Paulinho, Sandro or Dembele, but it seemed that people were calling for others to start over him when they weren't fully fit time and time again. I'd rather have Sandro and Paulinho and Dembele fully fit and ready to play rather than have them forced to play at 60% as they have been in the past and then have them aggravate the same injury they're trying to recover from.

true,samw11,null,null,"Things that I remember from when I worked in recruitment; (some people have strange ideas).

Men:

- always wear a tie, even if it's your old school tie for an interview.

- Never wear jewellery (apart from a wedding band) during the interview (the 'right' candidate for a job can be rejected based on an ear-ring, it's stupid, but true)

- iron your shirt with tramlines in the sleeve. Yes, I know that it's better to avoid tramlines, but the interviewer can see you have made an effort.

- long hair should be tied into a pony tail.

- shave or trim beards


Women:

- one pair of ear-rings only, and no unnecessary jewellery (bangles/necklaces etc)

- natural looking make-up.

- if you are wearing a skirt, wear tights. Bare legs are bad.

- hide your cleavage - it puts a lot of men off as well as women.

- wear a suit. A lot of women, wear smart casual clothes, but not suits, especially for jobs where they won't wear a suit for work, but for an interview wear a suit - even a cheap one.


BOTH:

- cover/hide tattoos

- wear a watch (unless it's a Mickey Mouse one), even if you're late, wearing a watch makes an impression that you can actually tell the time. (avoid anything too overt).

- wear dull/muted colours &amp; make sure that your clothes are clean, pressed and in good condition (a stray thread can catch someones attention &amp; then they forget how wonderful you are).

- accept a drink by all means, but try to stick to water (less chance of damage if you spill it).

- look the interviewer in the eye &amp; shake hands &amp; thank them for their time both on arrival and at departure.

- get there a few minutes early &amp; straighten your clothes/hair before you go in.


On your CV

- most go via email now, but if you are doing a paper copy don't use funky colours.

- Do check your spelling &amp; grammar.

- Don't let it be too long (even if you have to put old jobs in bullet points) try to stick to 2 pages max.

- Do have an email address that looks like your name rather than ""DestroyerofSomethingStupid42@dodgyip.com"", you'd be surprised how quickly that'll get your CV binned.

- Don't put socialising down as a hobby - it translates as ""I spend my spare time drinking heavily.""

- Make sure that you can talk about your hobbies. If you say cinema/reading, be able to talk about a book you read or a film you've seen.

- Do NOT lie about your qualifications - they may ask for a certificate - but you can say that you studied something at college without getting the qualification. It proves your honesty &amp; it shows that you have studied it at college, even if you didn't get an HND in it.

- Don't put referees on your CV - if they want a reference, they will ask.

- Don't put too much personal detail on your CV, they don't care if you are married or have twelve children - at this stage, they are not supposed to let it matter.

If you are still really struggling, try and find some volunteer work, there's usually some about. The forestry commission &amp; wildlife charities often look for people for short term projects, help out at a charity shop. It adds something to your CV that says ""I can get out of bed of a morning. I will put effort in. And I don't think things that are below my paygrade are beneath me.""

depends how much they know, if they know the kid has continuous dental problems and has extreme unsuitable lunches they can pass their concerns onto social services to investigate sure, they cant stop the child themselves.

true,JimmySevere,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,"&gt;Because you work for a union and therefore support its members.

I think you're having trouble with causation here. I dislike the plight of others (both members and non-members - we do a great deal of case work for people who are not members and never become ones) therefore I work for the union as a method to support people. Like I said, a voluntary union (not a single person in the union is paid); it can only mean this way round of causation.

A vested interest is the idea that the issue of workfare would impact me personally and as a result I would be more inclined to have a particular opinion on it. While I do have a vested interest in the sense that I could become unemployed and on JSA, it is the same interest as most people. Likely the same as you.

To consider the idea of taking action against something which you are ideologically opposed as being a vested interest only serves to cast vested interest as irrelevant to any debate. To say that in order to have a legitimate opinion you must not act on it is just plain ridiculous and I would suggest that in such a world, merely offering up an opinion is to act upon it and therefore voicing opinions is to stake a vested interest.

&gt;And yes, I do know what purpose trade unions serve. Once upon a time they used to be about the workers and now they're all about lining the pockets of the leaders.

Ermm, ok, I'm in a voluntary trade union. So, even if it were true for other unions, which I dispute, it clearly isn't true of mine.

&gt;All unions when it comes to the crunch will leave you to the wolves but gladly still take your union dues every week.

As dues in most every union are set according to pay, even in a straightforward capitalist sense it wouldn't make sense to ""leave members to the wolves."" While I would agree that unions are not nearly as effective as they once were, I'd argue that much of this is down to legislative changes undermining unions and solidarity resulting in a number of unions behaving more like an insurance policy than a campaign for fairer pay and conditions.

I'd also like to note that it'd be your employer sending you to the wolves and whilst inactivity on your union's part would be terrible, it's not them instigating the affair.

&gt;You don't see Bob Crowe living on strike pay when he calls the rail workers out do you? No. He sits there in his council house on more money than the prime minister.

It's peculiar and rather comical for you to choose one of the most successful unions in the UK at the moment. While I agree that Bob Crow does get paid over the odds, he has been a very effective gen sec for RMT members. If you're trying to argue that TU leaders are just in it for themselves, the RMT is a poor choice. I can't think of what would be an especially good choice for your argument though.

The fact he lives in a council house isn't all that pertinent an issue as I understand that that is down to his personal belief that basically everyone should.

I tend to work early shifts, so I go after I finish, and I get that daytimes are never going to be the busiest times, but even then, there's been a noticeable increase and drop off.

Most often, it's been a lot of very overweight people going hell-for-leather. Often they're with a friend, and are talking about how they're going o go every day, not eat ""naughty"" foods, going to eat 800cal a day, etc etc.

That sort of thing is unrealistic, unsustainable, and not going to work in the long run.

I like the exercise side of it because I have early onset arthritis and it helps that. If I keep active,  it keeps my joints in an okay state, and I experience less pain,so it's a win all round.

I put on about 30lb in fluid weight due to steroid treatment for this a while back, and I've had some other health issues, so the exercise has had a real psychological impact, and has made me more inclined to keep up my lifestyle changes.

And I guess that's where people go so wrong.diets don't work.

They've gone for the type of ""meat and two veg"" approach that doesn't treat macro or micro nutrients at all. That doesn't deal with stuff like measuring your TDEE and recording your daily intake with respect to it. You know actual dieting. If you want to treat obesity scientifically you have to record calories. Otherwise it is impossible to say where a person is.

At this point my position has actually moved on. Even if schools have the expertise at this point the government is giving them advice that doesn't actually help anything. So it is possible at this point that where schools have the expertise they could end up overruled by a government with ""old fashioned"" advice.

FWIW I don't necessarily disagree with this. Hell I only took a huge interest in diet because of being too far in the other direction.

It is just at the current degree of competency I think it is more likely people will be put off. The biggest reason people struggle with diet is a lack of faith in the official plans. People really don't believe it works. Mainly because they've been badly advised (or incompletely advised).

I also think they are doing this via the wrong channel. Dieting is a scientific process. You record numbers and make judgements in the long term. This process needs to be taught. Children should be taught how to record what they are eating. By all means make this part of their lunch. Have them tot up the nutritional reality of the lunch they've just had.

It's the same thing that happened with John Terry under AVB, I hate Terry but putting that aside, he has looked much better under every Chelsea coach to come in since AVB and him and Cahill look to be an outstanding duo because they are in a system that plays to their strengths.

true,samw11,english,Sunny Runny,"no, I'm sorry - you can't just call someone an idiot when you are using a spurious example. Taking sweeties off a child because *you* don't think that children should eat sweets when you are not in any form of charge of that child is theft, pure and simple.

The school (&amp; therefore teachers &amp; dining assistants) are in loco-parentis. They *do* have the right to prevent my child from doing something, even if it is something that she is allowed to do at home. It's implicit in the rules of sending your child to school.

These rules are there. They are known prior to sending your child to that school. If you don't like the rules then there are other (albeit drastic) alternatives. You can home-school your child, you can send them to a different school (every school interprets some rules differently), hell, you can leave the country or pay an arm and a leg to send your child to a school in a different country.

Your example was originally of ""disciplining"" my child. If my child slaps you as she walks past, then yell at her. Especially if I didn't see it, because if I had seen it, she'd be getting yelled at already. *Then* you moved the goal posts. Randomly taking a sweet from a child because of *your* views does not constitute disciplining someone else's offspring.

Don't call me an idiot because your original example made the wrong point. What you meant, was how would you feel if a random stranger stopped you from raising your child the way you see fit. It's still a spurious example, because the school, her teacher &amp; the government do not constitute random strangers.

But you want me to answer that point? Yeah, I'd be pissed off if a random stranger in the street took my parenting to task. I'd DEMAND to see their credentials &amp; believe me when I tell you, I *can* cause a scene. But, her teacher? Well, it annoys me that the children are sometimes given packets of sweets as special treats. Wanna know what I do about it? I trust that one packet of sweets more or one packet less, is not going to change the disciplines I instill in my daughter. &amp; want to know something else? It works, because if she is given sweets at school, she doesn't eat them, she brings them home &amp; puts them in the kitchen drawer until the weekend. She is 6 &amp; has more willpower on that score than I do. That tells me that my methods work &amp; school doing something a bit different, won't change that.

Three at the back is just another way of allowing a team to use 2/3 forwards and still not get over run in the middle of the field.

He also looked knackered, and I can't blame him because he was trying his best to do a job, but he never had a chance. So I take back my lazy comments.


Yaya confounded things by not really adapting at all. I think he started the game expecting to rampage around with 'dinho mopping up, but circumstances changed and we could have done with Barcelona Yaya last night, but he wasn't really interested for most of the game, then we were chasing and he had no choice but to attack full time.


**TL;DR** MDM was a liability vs those players, but its not his fault or Pellegrinis. Injuries, tactics and Yaya not helping early on left us a complete state in midfield.

---
P.S. Nastasic was not the plague, he was nervous as hell because he was exposed and out numbered several times. He's lacking game time and several times last night found he had no LB or DM to help him and kompany out vs Ramires, Hazard, Eto'o and Willian. Frankly I'd panic too, but its clear he's lacking confidence, thats all.

Did you watch him in the build up to the goal? He does a good job getting out to Hazard, then once Hazard moves towards the middle and Chelsea players are lining up in the box he leisurely walks that way, fairly disinterested, meanwhile Yaya who was deployed ahead him is in the box where he should be throwing blocks in but Ivanovic comes in to improve them numbers and scores a good goal.

Their were numerous events like this were he was lazy, also look at his positioning to allow Matic the shot he hits off the post from the edge of the box. Demichelis wasn't happy playing midfield at Bayern and he showed why yesterday.

I just want to point out how its pretty obvious as a response, its a certainty it would be thought of by many separate groups in the instance they heard such an attack happened, and it would be developed quickly. The components that would go into making it are all open source. 

Thinking what would go into its design, there would be some kind of encryption tool, Truecrypt is easy to use almost open source and might be hackable into an app, a BitTorrent client many of which are opensource and so is the protocol free to use, and some kind of rss client built in too, to announce the magnet link for the torrent to all the offices running the app, which automatically add the torrent to their list.

The files would probably be small, many revisions could be kept before some get purged after a few months say. 

Getting blue sky, im wondering if some kind of git repository system could be built on top of a distributed (similar to torrents) filesystem, where subsequent uploads can be submitted in chronological order to the distributed file system, still encrypted, and make the thing easy to navigate... I think thats overkill and probably a much more difficult project.

The deadman is overkill for what its being designed for, the threat is to the destruction of one journalists individual story being sabotaged through confiscation, theres no indication of a legal or physical threat to their person or freedom of movement, and until that becomes apparent, it seems silly to build a tool like that with no ""safety switch"" built in, it makes the tool a little more dangerous when it needn't be. The app could be updated to feature that if the political climate changed.

The issue we're having is, if we play Sterling, we have 3 attackers + Countinho, leaving 2 MF spots. Countinho has been trying defensively but hes no Joe Allen or Lucas.

As you stated schools will receive a sum to fund the free school meal system. Obviously the amount given by government is going to be relative to the needs of each school. It's not going to be X amount for a school with 300 pupils and the same amount for a school with 100. 

However if parents register as not requiring a free school meal (because they provide packed lunch) then that would take the student figure for the school down meaning less money from government. 

So they're going to ban packed lunch and force everybody onto their free school meal scheme. 

Meanwhile, the minimal amount of money from that sum will be used to actually fund the system. Corners will be cut, savings made, desserts either removed or limited in the name of healthy eating.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Basically, in the English/Welsh act as passed and the Scottish bill before it was amended, then if you were issued a Gender Recognition Act and your spouse agreed, your marriage would be re-registered and your legal gender would be changed. All good, right?

The problem is what happens if your spouse *doesn't* agree to it - then your legal gender won't be recognised, nor will you be able to get it recognised until the marriage ends. Now, granted, your spouse getting a GRC is automatic grounds for separation if you wish to do so. The problem is that separation proceedings can take a very long time, and so a malicious spouse could try to extract concessions with the prospect of a quicker separation, since the transitioning spouse would really not like to wait any longer to have legal recognition.

Supposedly those provisions were to protect the non-transitioning spouse from having their marriage re-registered as a same-sex/opposite-sex marriage. However, that argument makes no sense considering that simply to obtain a Gender Recognition Certificate requires you to have been transitioned and living full-time in your new gender for two years - if the spouse didn't want to continue the marriage, they had ample opportunity to start divorce proceedings in that time.

So, the Scottish bill was amended such that if your spouse doesn't consent to re-registering the marriage, you can change your gender anyway, but the marriage will still be under your old name and gender. This solves the problems mentioned above, because divorce and recognition of your gender are no longer linked and your spouse would have no power to delay your ability to have legal recognition of your gender.",0,1391523562,null,0,false,0,cf6razd,t3_1wz4o1,t1_cf6razd,t1_cf6r5n5,null,1432247165,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

They're not raising the price on wine, or anything drank by those who vote.  They are raising the price primarily of that drank by addicts - white cider for the most part, at £4.49 for 22 units - close to a full bottle of spirits.

Only people with a drink problem buy white cider, and an alcoholic doesn't give a shit if his carryout costs a pound more. He'll just eat even less and drink the same. He'd drink the same even if it meant no food whatsoever. Believe me, big business is very well aware of that. They spend a lot of money learning these things.

This is all about the government courting the drinks industry whilst appearing to do the right thing.

These things are never about the public good. As always, follow the money.

The 3-5-2 does work when used effectively. Your squad has to be smart, quick, and technically savvy. So in answer to your specific selection, I would say that it won't work against a decent side.

Verts and Chiriches  are a good choice, although Chir is still error prone. As long as Dawson doesn't come too far forward, he'll do his job. My personal opinion is that Rose and Walker were almost made for the role you gave them, but Rose isn't quite as sly as he needs to be (no matter where he plays), and Walker has this mad proclivity of getting lost in the opp. corner or skying a shot.

The Pau-San-Erik midfield you have almost guarantees that it will be effectively a 3-3-2-2, because Paulinho likes to jet forward... which is good, but not particularly for this position. Finally, I would love to see Lamela where you have him, but Ade up there doing his coin-flipping will-I-play-or-not routine just scrubs the whole plan.

In this formation, we really need to depend on everyone doing their job with full concentration.

There is substantial research to suggest that increasing price decreases consumption by heaviest drinkers and levels of liver disease down the line accordingly.

So are we all paying a price for the actions of two-thirds of ""young people"" from *one city* who got arrested for crimes committed while drunk?

Opposition to Gay marriage crosses the sectarian divide with religious bigots and zealots from both sides united in their stand against it.  Perhaps, it this particular brand of ""Unionism"" that you mean in your comments.  On the up side, it’s nice to see that there is some common ground out there.


While I don’t agree with religious inspired sentiments that oppose Gay marriage, I realise that these beliefs are firmly held and I do respect and tolerate this kind of viewpoint (although not understand them).   I also feel that it’s morally indefensible to force any religion to participate in a Gay Marriage ceremony against their beliefs. 


My solution would be simple; remove the authority of any Church/Religion (of any kind) to Licence or Officiate at a legal marriage ceremony.  Only the state can marry couples and only the State marriage is legal, no other marriage ceremony would be legal and binding.  If couples then want the “window dressing” of a religious ceremony then that’s fine, but only the State marriage is valid.


That way we have marriage for all, and avoid trampling on some (strange but deeply held) religious beliefs.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"Libya exposed all the reasons we need EU defence co-operation and simultaneously all the reasons it cannot work. It was a tour de force on the necessity and complete impossibility of it.

Honestly I think the EU is the wrong vehicle for this. Simply because Germany are involved. I don't want the Germans outside but we have an actor that is quite happy to sell weapons to all of Europe but doesn't want to contribute lives, money, time or even political weight to foreign policy objectives.

I think a new European project for defence is necessary. We need to agree on the following issues:

1. What are the foreign policy focuses of the European project? In particular in our back yard we have issues in North Africa, the levant, the balkans (less so than historic), the caucasus, the middle east and now near civil war in Ukraine. What are appropriate European responses to these threats? How does Europe feel about foreign jihadists taking over Mali? If we agree that having jihadists overthrow a government isn't ideal what are we prepared to commit? Under what circumstances? France was invited to Mali, is that the condition? Libya had UNSC clearance, is that what is required? Are there conditions under which we would go in without UNSC or invitation?

2. Division of labour. Are we to have a Europe where Britain and France do most of the fighting while others provide fuel, munitions, support? Is there to be full defence contributions from all sides? With some schedule to ensure all take part?

Right now I can't imagine getting agreement on these from the EU. France and Britain could certainly agree on these. Others maybe can join.",0,1391528940,null,0,1391529462,0,cf6t652,t3_1wyuty,t1_cf6t652,t3_1wyuty,null,1432248044,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Not a chance, because the artificial high price of the cheap crap will increase the demand for the nice stuff, which will then raise the price.

true,0x_,null,null,"It didn't seem to make design sense to include a DMS in the app. But then i realised you're already depending on a centralised server when you use RSS to announce the torrent, and the reporter would probably use some kind of seedbox at the office to initially upload the file to. It would make sense if the file at arrival at the seedbox could be verified as intact, as once its being shared, its integrity is very likely guaranteed, its that first upload thats most at risk. Anyway so i realised. With a centralised server required to do announce by RSS you *could* host a DMS service on the same website if needed, i just dont think it is.

Going back. I dont think the RSS being centralised to the newspapers office is as foolproof at using a service like twitter to announce new magnetlinks, which would remove the need for an RSS service. Skipping the newspaper office hosted seedbox would be ideal too, but this would mean the reporter cannot just ""upload and go"" in a few minutes, but must wait for the magnetlink announce over twitter to pick up a another few seeds, ideally verified as including the public IP addresses of several newspapers and media organisations, then they can disconnect and the torrent is securely ""in the cloud"". This could take an average of 5-10 minutes i'd guess. Which might dissuade the reporter from making as regular backups as one where they just say FTP the thing over to the office seedbox and its done.

Im not mad keen on the DMS functionality being part of the same software. I do see the need for timer-activated release of decryption keys, or even timer-activated destruction of keys in some drastic cases, but its better as a separate service, especially as i've shown this software app i've defined, could work completely independently of any centralised server except twitter, and twitter is presently ideal for this kind of thing.

 [**Chinese New Year**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese%20New%20Year): 

---

&gt;**Chinese New Year** is an important [traditional Chinese holiday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_holidays) celebrated at the turn of the [Chinese calendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calendar). In [China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China), it is also known as the **Spring Festival**, the literal translation of the modern Chinese name. Chinese New Year celebrations traditionally run from Chinese New Year's Eve, the last day of the last month of the Chinese calendar, to the [Lantern Festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lantern_Festival) on the 15th day of the first month, making the festival the longest in the Chinese calendar. Because the Chinese calendar is [lunisolar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunisolar_calendar), the Chinese New Year is often referred to as the ""**Lunar New Year**"".

No, no need for you to have such an inferiority complex. I was saying that I was basing it on having watched the games rather than whoscored.com's stats. 

But you certainly get a different perspective attending a game. And the consensus of people that sit near me, and of my friends is that jis long passes are erratic at best.

There's no conspiracy. There's a very clear link between pricing and abuse. It's backed by scientists, the BMA and has nothing to do with some price fixing plan between supermarkets. We've also done similar things already, with high taxes on cigarettes making them expensive to put people off, and by banning certain types of drink promotions.

Bars and clubs are under much better control now than they used to be, and local police seem to be a bit harder with regard to licensing. But supermarkets have been pulling this shit forever, offering cut-price alcohol, even selling at a loss, because it makes you more likely to buy something else while you are in there.

For you to say that the government never do something in the public good is just over-cynical nonsense. Believe it or not ""the government"" is made up from normal people and most of them are decent and want what is best for the people in the country.

true,[deleted],null,null,"But again, Hazard was named POTY in France the year he moved to Chelsea. Eden played brilliantly and attacked the opposition and created lots of chances for Chelsea pretty much the whole year. Lamela looks like he is out of bounds when on the pitch for us.. He is far from as pacey as Hazard, but still. 

If Lamela started with an assist and a penalty the first 10 minutes of his first match, it would've been something else. AVB saw so much we didn't. I don't think you can blame him as much as you'd like to, really..

How exactly would this work?  Are these people really just pretending to be fruitcakes, or have they somehow been manipulated into joining UKIP by someone else?  Are the people behind this plot the same as the people behind the various climate and health-related conspiracies that UKIP believe in?  If so, they have their fingers in a lot of pies - must be the New World Order or something.

&gt; This guy was originally a Conservative employee and member, then voluntarily joined UKIP for a very short period, then went back to the Conservatives, and now this story has broken and everyone is talking about him being a UKIP representative, but not about his Conservative connections? The Conservatives are trying to distance themselves by saying they ""never fully took him back"", whatever that means.

This article says he was a Conservative member during 2008-9, then a UKIP member from 2011 to 2013, during which time he served as a spokesperson for them and was praised by senior party officials, then recently tried to rejoin the Tories but was rejected due to his prominent UKIP role.

There is a difference between inter- and intra-country correlations between price and consumption.  It's difficult to correlate across culture divides, yes, but it can be done provided you adjust the data.  Since we are talking about the correlation on a per-country basis, there is a lot of evidence to link price decreases with increased consumption.  See [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1360-0443.2003.00461.x/full) in Switzerland for example.  Or you might like this [extensive review (pdf warning](http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh26-1/22-34.pdf).  

The price elasticity of spirits in the UK [is estimated at -1.31](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/research/alcohol-demand.pdf) - a 10% increase in cost could expect to reduce consumption by 13%.

Our rates of liver disease related to alcohol are average, but increasing.  Regardless of whats happening in other countries, increasing price would cut down consumption, and reduce harms, especially where wines and spirits are concerned.

That rate gives us a difference between 27 and about 27.5 points from the last 14.

This is all of course neglecting our improvement in the first part of the season, we've improved by 13 points from the same fixtures season over season, which is the highest of any team in the top 6, even beating City who slipped to 10 after the defeat to Chelsea.

EDIT: Looking at the number of points we've gained over 24 match weeks. 

We've improved by 13 points ---&gt; our ppg rate has improved by 0.542 ppg! 

If we add that ppg improvement to last years rate over the corresponding fixtures.... 

we would be doing 2.47 ppg!! 

This implies if we improve our performance over the same fixtures are the same rate as over the whole season we would end the season with ~81.6 points...

Of course the conservative estimate of 74 is a safer bet. I think we'll end up with something between 74 and 81.6 points.

Just as a note, there can be motivations to learn the language that are entirely unrelated to 'heritage' and 'culture'. I understand those words are the best way to get through to the man who struggles to hear you over the beat of his lambeg drum though. 

Personally, I couldn't give much of a toss what my family did or thought beyond those that I knew first-hand. If history shows anything, you know it's almost certainly something that you wouldn't be entirely proud of since times and attitudes change, and the idea that you should somehow be defined by the actions of your ancestors is a whole lot of the problem when it comes to our part of the world. I would just like to learn Irish because I have independently come to identify as an Irishman who is also Northern Irish (part of the UK), living in England and therefore now British (to a far greater extent than I previously considered myself British). But you won't see me at the twelfth, the bonies, singing the sash or voting for the DUP.

There are various reasons why one or both parties might prefer a divorce though, aren't there?

&gt; The only way a spouse can drag this out is by refusing to agree to the petition for nullity, which would be prima facie evidence of their intention to allow the marriage to continue.

As far as I understand it, for the GRC to go ahead, the spouse has to formally agree to it - I don't think evidence suggesting that they probably would agree to it is enough.

I think the main problem with it is symbolic, though.  It seems to suggest either that the government still considers same-sex marriage to be a fundamentally different beast to opposite-sex marriage (so that your permission is necessary to move from one to the other), or that someone undergoing legal gender recognition is such a horrific and controversial thing that their spouse has to have the option to get divorced first, so that they don't have to spend a short period of time officially married to a trans person.",0,1391539371,null,0,false,0,cf6xu6u,t3_1wz4o1,t1_cf6xu6u,t1_cf6rirv,null,1432250309,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I've spent the majority of my life being single on Valentine's Day or being with shiesters who think a potted plant ('cos roses are a rip off on Valentine's aren't they?') from M&amp;S signifies true love. I hope he was embarrassed when the £80 bouquet I sent him arrived, the skinflint! Yeah, he didn't last long. Not just because he was tight, but because he'd eat with his mouth open and tut all the time too.

I think my husband might've dressed up in a tux and cooked a three course meal once, I *think*, the old memory's a bit hazy-like due to being ancient.

I used to be obsessed with making sure I had something to do on Valentine's Day so when asked the inevitable 'what are you doing tonight' question, I had an answer. One year, this lead (led? I can never remember) to me seeing The Go! Team, LCD Soundsystem and Soulwax at the same gig (I arrived late and missed Juliette - Ms Lewis - of Juliette and the Licks, which I was pissed about). My 'date' was someone I'd had a brief fling with some years back and we were at the 'let's pretend to be friends' stage some years later, and he didn't like the music. Still, I had a bloody good time.

Without a doubt one of the greatest things about getting older is developing the ability not to give a shit about what other people think.

This year, I'm thinking of repeating the sexiest experience have had thus far in 2014: having a haircut I don't thoroughly detest. To say I left there moist would be a slight exaggeration, but it's the god damn closest I'll be getting to that state of excitement for a while.

I think everyone is quick to blame him, but he wasn't that bad. I blame the forwards more for losing possession too easily and starting a lot of Chelsea's counter attacks.

Chelsea was consistently countering, forcing players like Zabaletta and Toure to hang a bit deeper which really weakenned our offence. Navas isn't as useful without a player on the over/under lap. 

Kolarov got away with playing so high on his side since it was Ramires playing that wing who was dropping deep to defend. 

The offence Pelle wanted to play wasn't working due to bad form of the strikers and the threat of the counter attack. He should've switched to plan B (1 striker, three central mids).

There are lots of French names and different points in the castle I'm meant to remember and can't, but essentially it's a very old detective novel with quaint language and it's alright.

Before that I finished [The story of Edgar Sawtelle](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2731276-the-story-of-edgar-sawtelle?bf=1000&amp;from_search=true). He's deeply into dogs. It grabbed me for probably 1/3rd of the book but lost me at the end, when I just felt angry about the first third I'd forced myself through, fighting the inclination to throw the damn thing in the bin. I doubt he's going to write anything else soon, he's a dog breeder or something. 

Next up, unsure. I've still to finish a book on how France formed, I've got a PDF of American Psycho, and the CS Lewis Narnia collection which has been collecting dust on my shelf for five years is calling to me.

On liver damage, I know we've tried it before and failed, but one of the biggest improvements we could make to liver health in the UK in relation to damage caused by alcohol I'd guess would be to change our drinking culture.  Drinking large quantities of alcohol regularly without eating, specifically without eating fibrous foods at around the same time, is the surest route to liver damage in the medium to long term.  If we can't go the whole way to drinking only when dining and become a Mediterranean or Gallic culture overnight, perhaps there are other ways to encourage consumption of fibre when people are drinking?

Public transport is handled by passenger transport authorities, ""Transport for London"" in this case, these authorities are regulated and governed by, in part, the Transport Act.

&gt; Part II Local transport
Local transport plans and bus strategies
&gt; 108 Local transport plans.

&gt; (1)Each local transport authority must—

&gt; (a)develop policies for the promotion and encouragement of safe, integrated, **efficient and economic** transport facilities and services to, from and within their area, and

&gt; (b)carry out their functions so as to implement those policies.

&gt;(2)The transport facilities and services mentioned in subsection (1) are—

&gt;**(a)those required to meet the needs of persons living or working in the authority’s area, or visiting or travelling through that area, and**

&gt;(b)those required for the transportation of freight;

&gt;and include facilities and services for pedestrians. 


And from TFA 

&gt;The measure, which was first revealed last year, is being introduced **despite being backed by only one third of bus users** in a recent public consultation.

Since the CoE allowed contraception there was an implicit acceptance that procreation was not the be-all of marriage. As social rules should broadly be promoting the passing on of our culture to future generations, this altering of the social fabric was significant. Today, allowing unions where procreation is inherently impossible, unions that aren't about the future of society (but only about the future of the couple, adoption aside, which is a related issue that I won't touch upon) should not necessarily be implicitly promoted as they change the wider conception of what marriage means. One possible example is that having less emphasis on raising kids and the social-future as a central meaning of marriage might mean that other couples take their duties to the young less seriously (less worry about divorce, especially with other welfare help available).

Even if you don't agree with the above (I don't), your comment indicates that you think social changes are totally independent of one another (I.e. gay marriage can't possibly influence other attitudes towards marriage or relationships in general) This seems an odd stance to take. As an example of interrelated things: in the US, without free healthcare, people often don't get treated for minor concerns and they often linger until they're major concerns, leading to more time off work (and less herd-immunity from lower vaccination rates) for illness.",0,1391543443,null,0,false,0,cf6zw07,t3_1x08bt,t1_cf6zw07,t1_cf6zerx,null,1432251276,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

This identified significant risks with persistent standing and ability to steward and police potentially disorderly and violent behaviour on the upper tier.
The cup game against Chelsea proved this to be a correct assumption. Very few of the spectators on the upper tier sat and those who wanted to were unable to do so unless in the front rows of seats.
The front two rows had been netted, as we did for previous cup games, but this was breached by spectators wanting to sit and get out of the crowd, or by others leading chanting and singing.
The increased level of stewarding and policing had no impact on behaviour and attempts to throw missiles onto the Arsenal fans below were witnessed.
Flares were let off in the lower tier and had this happened on the upper tier, this could have precipitated panic amongst the standing fans.

In order for a proper 3-5-2 to be successful you either need two of the best wing backs in the game, or you need 4 wing backs (that is to say, 2 to be subbed in at 60' when the others are dead). Furthermore, you have to be willing to have your CB make heart-attack stops in defence. A 3-5-2 is a formation that lets the attackers rest/focus purely on attack while the backs do all of the build-up work. This makes it a formation that is outstanding if you have a multitude of backs at your disposal or are short on good holding midfielders.

Basically, we have the starting XI to do it well, but we don't have the bench. We have too many good midfielders to rely on a formation that kind of requires you to win 4-3 every game.

http://connect.garmin.com/activity/361074700

Some parts of the route are quite exposed (between Oakington and Longstanton), and can be quite windy. But usually when the BBC weather reports something under 15mph, it's not too bad. Other stretches are either in cuttings or have some shelter against the wind.

Flooding is really bad on the stretch between Swavesey and St Ives making the route impassible 2-4 months of the year. I work around this by leaving at the cycle track at Swavesey and taking local roads and tracks just south of the flooded lakes (adds about 15-20 minutes).  If you need to go to St Ives, you will need to do a similar thing and continue through Fenstanton along the road (follow national cycle route 11 signs), and get to St Ives along Low Road (also flooded sometimes).

However I genuinely think the weak link in this formation would be Dawson who simply does not have enough pace to play in a defensive three.  

Without wanting to be rude it seems a crude attempt to shoehorn as many of our attacking players in as possible. At times we have struggled with having 4 at the back, so to have one less and be even more reliant on people tracking back is not something I think we're capable of.

What we really need to is start playing two holding midfielders together, instead of Ferdinand's rather pointless assertions that DM's aren't required.  Under AVB last season we seemed to be more defensively resolute with an emphasis on playing from the back, this was achieved by the fullbacks pushing forward, and centre backs separating, DM's dropping back to collect the ball and the attack starting.

I think our best formation would be to have pace out wide, and actually use it. It's no use having Lennon in the side to then constantly moan about him being anonymous when he's starved of service. Having Eriksen behind Adebayor, or Ade with Soldado rounds things of nicely, having said that, is love to see Lamela getting game time when fit. Maybe as part of a 3 up top. 

Oh and final part, switching to a 352 now would create more problems as we don't have sufficient time to start trying to work out a new formation as we chase 4th or higher.

In both Canada and South Africa, couples with British CPs have had to resort to expensive litigation to have their partnerships recognized. Similar problems could be expected in the US now that the federal government there recognizes SSM.

* If a person who is married or in a civil partnership wants to change their legal gender under the Gender Recognition Act, they are required to get divorced. Even if the couple wants to stay together - they can get civilly partnered or married (as appropriate) immediately after the gender recognition certificate is issued, but they still have to go through the whole divorce.

Look at it this way: assume that there is 33.3% chance of a win, 33.3% loss, and 33.3% draw in our match (read: Arsenal away to Liverpool is a completely even match). So there's a 33% chance we lose. Then say the same for the Everton match. 33% chance they win. Now, the probability of both happening is 0.33*0.33 = 0.11 or 11%. Taking into consideration that home teams have a massive historical advantage (at least in the last few years) and the drop from 11% to 8% in odds that both away teams win should not be all that surprising. 

This is how they lure people into betting on stuff like this though.

Everything you said about married couples not having kids and unmarried couples having them is *exactly* what you'd expect if the nature of marriage, as an institution to protect cultural inheritance, has changed. Read any C19 British novel and you'll see a totally different aspect of marriage where it was quite explicitly about procreation. The fact that you led with ""procreation has nothing to do with marriage"" is clear proof that the nature of marriage has changed. Two major reasons it has changed are contraception and women entering the workforce, causing huge social changes.

However, I am careful to say ""changes"". Personally, I think those changes (women's emancipation) are positive ones by most measures. However, that doesn't mean that all change is good. As a historical counterexample, Communism, as practiced in the USSR, radically redefined the individual's relationship to the state. Everyone, even most functionaries within it, were subject to a monolithic construct of forced equality. People were largely forbidden from acting outside the purview of the state and this caused a lot of misery.

My central point: marriage has changed in the last hundred years. Gay unions will likely change it further. Some change is good, some is bad, and we can't necessarily predict which in advance.

I think this exact issue is what troubles me so much in terms of our play.  We have very little control of the game, especially when we are out of possession.

The fact that we've now had four games with losses of three or more goals (and three of those games at home!) shows that we have no ability to stem the tide, even for the simple sake of avoiding embarrassment.

Unfortunately, we don't have the quality to break down top teams at the moment.  So we need to rely on clever team play and smart tactics.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"There are definitely other ways of playing a back three (Bielsa traditionally uses a different setup to this, especially when he was in charge of Chile).  I do think Juve's current side are the best modern exponents of it however, which is why I leaned on that comparison so much.

It is true that distribution between the lines is important no matter what formation you play.  I think three at the back makes it more crucial, simply because any ball lost in deep midfield almost necessarily forces one of the CBs to step up.  If another gets pulled wide due to a run up the flanks, it then leaves you with only one man against the opposition striker.  Juve's back three are very well drilled and have an implicit understanding about who steps up and who stays back, which somewhat mitigates the problem.

The reason I don't think Sandro is that suited to a deep midfielder in this system is because I think his distribution is lacking.  He's more effective as a destroyer than a builder, as I'm not sure his range of passing is good enough.  The regista (or CDM, however you want to play it) will necessarily end up playing some long balls to release pressure from the back, and Sandro struggles at that a little I find.

If we did play a deep passer in the mould of Juve, Sandro would almost be more suited to the Pogba/Vidal, chasing down the ball higher up the pitch and keeping the opposition under constant pressure.

&gt;- How come the Doctor can speak English, and I mean **perfect** English, and with an accent, this isn't adequately explained, it makes sense he'd understand the language of the region he's going to, but this means he'd have to know **a lot** of languages, and that'd require a lot of time and brain space. 

He's good with languages and has both time and brain space. He claims to speak everything now.

&gt;- On the subject, how come he looks so **human** while being an alien, did he purposefully take this form so he could blend into human society or is there some other reason?

That's what Time Lords look like; if anything, humans look like them.

&gt;- How come the Doctor was so **casual** about the fact he had a time machine and was an alien? I mean, you'd think this would get him in trouble with basically **anyone** who wouldn't mind murdering him to seize his time machine and study it. 

He's just like that, plus no one would be able to gain the upper hand anyway.

&gt;- Why is the TARDIS a police box? That sort of camouflage would only work on **Earth** and at a time where police boxes are a common sight. Does it automatically camouflage to the place and time it lands in, or is there some sort of reason for it?

It was on Earth when the  chameleon circuit got stuck. It's not supposed to look like that, and he fixed it once, but he likes it like that and doesn't bother fixing it.

&gt;- How come he just let Rose ride with him in the TARDIS, I mean, it was done fairly casually with him knowing **little to nothing** about who she was and what her importance in that place and time was, basically **anyone** would take him up on the offer, leading to a lot of issues that could arise.

true,Silocon,null,null,"If marriage between male-female couples who cannot procreate (due to age, illness, or other reasons) has never been disallowed then what could their existence in society change marriage from/to?  Change inherently means that what comes after is different from what came before. Also, having parents stay together after childbearing years has obvious benefits to their offspring in providing emotional support, childcare, advice, maybe financial support etc. While that doesn't directly address your point about couples that marry after childbearing age, I imagine that it was supported as marriage was considered a generally ""proper"" way of living, as well as providing support to any children from earlier marriages.

As to your last point, I don't agree that gay marriage ""devalues"" marriage, nor does my friend (AFAIK). What both he and I are saying is that it *changes* how society views marriage. The word ""devalues"" was thrown about a lot, especially in the USA debate - but disagreeing with gay marriage certainly doesn't align anyone with those nutters. Neither of us are making moral judgements that gay marriage is sinful, as the word ""devalues"" would imply.

He thinks that such social changes should be adopted only very carefully and slowly because gradual change is the safer route. Rapid change can lead to societal collapse (though doesn't necessarily); in an extreme example, consider the Central Americas when Europeans arrived. He sees British history as a gradual evolution over ~1000 years and it has survived and prospered, so he sees no reason to rapidly change social institutions. As before, I disagree with him and think that some drastic social changes are a good thing, such as the creation of the NHS, or state pensions (good as an idea, though I strongly disagree with their implementation). There's another example: pensions radically altered our conceptions of old age. Before there was a strong incentive to have children to support you in your infirmity when you *couldn't* work anymore. Thanks to healthcare and nutritional improvements, many people are fully able to work past 60/65 but there is a common attitude nowadays that people deserve a rest at the end of their life to enjoy their hard earned wealth even if they're fully able to continue working. Personally, I think this is a good thing (though poorly administered), but now we hear much news of a pensions crisis because people are living so long and retiring at such a young age and yet there's huge resistance to increasing the pension age (see the 2011 national sector strikes).

TL;DR ""change"" is different from ""devalues"" and requires that what comes after is different from what came before. Sometimes slow change is advisable.",0,1391555330,null,0,false,0,cf75opq,t3_1x08bt,t1_cf75opq,t1_cf74nr4,null,1432254074,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

&gt;I've been to farms and quarries where palestinians and jews work side by side, sharing jokes and arguments like any other workplace in the world.

I agree that there's no fundamental racial incompatibility between Israelis and Palestinians, and those that say otherwise are evincing more about themselves than they are about the problems of the region.  The problems are ultimately political.

true,puckyou,flair7,,"Honestly, AVB did a pretty good job here. He got the team within one point of fourth place in his only full season while also securing Tottenham's most points in the Premier League era and second most in the 3 point era, behind the 77 recorded in the 1984-85 season. 

I also think that possession style football could work at Spurs. A lot of people thought Everton couldn't pass out of the back and play a possession style but look at how well they've played under Martinez.   Part of the reason it didn't work out all that great was that a lot of new players came into the team. Many of these players came in near the end of the window and never really got a chance to get acclimated to the system of play before the season started. 

As for Laudrup I don't really rate him as a manager. Like a lot of people said he seems a bit disinterested. I feel he is a bit overrated because of the cup run that Swansea had last season. Also since the beginning of last January Swansea have won 10 of 41 games and only recorded 41 points not really the mark of a great manager.

Edit: Also to add to my point about Laudrup I think that he inherited a team that was put in a fairly good position to succeed due to the club's previous two managers being Martinez and Rodgers. Both of whom are now managing a teams that have a good shot at finishing in the top 4 this season.

true,sn7x,null,null,"To an outside view this seems like an absolutely bizarre decision, but it isn't. As much as ML has done for us, and we'll always be grateful, we haven't been great since winning the league cup. Laudrup's tactics have been sussed and instead of juggling them around he continued to use the same ones as before. We've won just 8 out of our last 36 league matches, that's absolutely shocking, we've won just 8 home games under Laudrup's tenure and as some of you might know we had decent home form under Brendan Rodgers.

There has also been an extreme amount of tension surrounding the backroom staff which had caused ML's and Huw Jenkins' relationship to become severed.
There has also been very little passion under ML, players don't seem to want to play for him and that's obviously a very bad thing. I don't know if this was because of ML's attitude rubbing off onto the players as he was leaving the club in the summer anyway to pursue ""bigger"" prospects. If anyone has watched our recent games we literally haven't shown any passion, the odd few players have such as Williams, Shelvey, Ben Davies and Rangel but apart from that they've had the negative attitude of Laudrup rub off onto them.

In conclusion, it's been coming for a long time and we might finally get rid of some of the shite in the squad that are only there for the money and not the club or the shirt. I'm now hoping that Garry Monk and Alan Curtis, both arguably club legends, can instill the mentality of the derby into the players and explain to them that this isn't just a regular premier league match and how much it means to us as fans.

When it comes to possible replacements I'd really like to see Gus Poyet take the reigns but that's highly unlikely considering the miracle work he's currently performing at Sunderland, other possible replacements I'd like to see are di Matteo or AVB, again both unlikely. I wish all the best to Michael Laudrup and I'm incredibly grateful for what he has helped us achieve but it's time to end this chapter and start a new one.

It doesn't take ""guts"" to be a homophobe. They're pathetic. Ask any homophobe to justify their position with logic, reason, facts, evidence or sources and they run away with their tail between their legs. Call out any homophobe to provide sources for their ""opinion"" and watch them high tail it out of there or dig themselves into a hole of idiocy or resort to ad homien attacks and insults. Their ""logic"" and ""facts"" quickly crumble under the slightest scrutiny, and their ""opinion"" is founded on nothing short of horse manure.

They have to resort to petty lies, deliberately obtuse arguments and straw men when they ""debate"".

Not sure who this would be, but hopefully not Balotelli. It sure seems like Mourinho has broken Hazard's ego for the better, but I don't even care to see Jose try with Balotelli. He draws too much attention to himself, which is the opposite of what Jose seems to want from this team. 

Luke Shaw is another potential signing that I would definitely support. I'm not sure where that would put Azpi, unless he maintained the starting spot and Shaw rotated in. Bertrand would probably get sold in that case, I suppose to Villa if his form keeps up. 

Besides those two signings, I think it really all hinges on whether or not the old guard finally step down or stay on for one more season. If Terry leaves we'll probably need another CB unless we moved Ivanovic there. If Lampard leaves we might not need to buy since MVG will be back and we'll have Mikel, Matic, and Ramires with the potential of Chalobah coming home.

Well then perhaps you shouldn't have said ""Look at the new set of demands having arisen from those who wanted gay marriage."" if you don't even know what those demands are.

&gt;That 'thing' was the canadian prime minister seeking legal advice to assure peoplethat 'marriage equality' would not lead to polagamy and the advice was actually no- if you say all people are equal and should be free to marry who they want then you cant ring fence it to just those with a high media presence.

According to [the National Post article](http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=8451dc17-5b5f-4ea4-a05f-71f7c758662a&amp;), the demands for polygamy were coming from fundamentalist Mormons and from Muslims, both groups who are heavily *opposed* to same-sex marriage. So that is definitely not a case of a demand that arose ""from those who wanted gay marriage"", as you put it.

&gt;Does it have to be unique to exist or does it just not matter because other people do it?

It doesn't have to be unique to exist.

However, it is the average player positions for the entire match ([link](http://i.imgur.com/feLBkCH.png)) that make me think it was a 4-2-3-1. There is a clear divide between Luiz and Matic and the rest. Furthermore, Ramires' position is the widest of all the midfields, even Hazard.

 New forest is on the doorstep and there are a few beaches nearby ( although not in Southampton itself, Bournemouth is nice about an hour down the road).

If you really want to reduce obesity, my tips would be...

1.  Make healthy food as affordable as all the carbs-and-fat junk food. That includes protein, not just fresh fruit and veg.

2.  Education to counter all the carbs-and-fat junk food advertising, and more regulation of food advertizing. It should be impossible to be fooled into believing that those ""healthy"" cereal bars are healthy compared with anything other than maybe chocolate bars (and some are worse than e.g. a Mars bar). Remember - if you're overweight and hungry, you probably need to eat more of something - but less fat and carbohydrate. The only other form of calorie is protein.

3.  Make it a criminal offense to ridicule or harass fat people, especially when they're out trying to get exercise. Chronic stress has been linked to obesity (no, it's not behavioural, it's related to metabolic changes) and besides, driving people back indoors is a moronic way to try to motivate them to lose weight. Include it in discrimination law, perhaps. TBH this is less of an issue than it was in the past, but it's still an issue.

If someone fenced off most of Ealing Common and told me I couldn't cut through I'd be pretty pissed off too. Their complaints about the architecture I have little sympathy for. Their argument that the sports facility has been poorly managed I can buy - but will Ealing ever manage it well? As an Ealing tax payer, maybe I'll benefit from them dropping it out of the budget.

I have an 06 Range Rover which is showing a fault with the adaptive headlights (#12 on [here](http://ww2.justanswer.com/uploads/AR/Arench/2013-01-01_171419_rover.pdf)). I'm not sure what the actual fault involves though as everything appears to work fine. The headlights swivel about and point in the direction the car is steering and the correct sidelight is illuminated if you lock over further.

The car also has another fault which I'm hoping is alternator/battery related. The car sometimes needs to be jumped if it's been stood for more than a day or two. It probably isn't, but I'm hoping it's a battery/alternator issue, (if it's a proper electrical fault they can be extremely hard to diagnose on Range Rovers and can get expensive to fix).

I live in rural South Notts and rarely come into Nottingham itself but if this is something you think you could diagnose then I might try and swing by next time I'm in the area (probably won't be for a while though). I'm always looking to help out fellow small business owners.

Also, do you do MOTs?

Another thing, do you have a Mazda/Ford OBD adapter cable?

I also have an 04 Ford Ranger which is showing an ABS fault, I could do with that diagnosing at some point as well. The truck is mainly used offroad and is caked in mud at the minute so I'm suspecting a simple sensor issue. No rush with this one as the MOT isn't due for a while and I'm not too fussed about not having working ABS as you [don't really want it when driving in mud anyway](http://www.4x4abc.com/4WD101/ABS_offroad.html).",0,1391568057,null,0,1391568849,0,cf7bgh4,t3_1x1bfp,t1_cf7bgh4,t3_1x1bfp,null,1432256795,2,false,nottingham,t5_2qmbu,2
true,LongDongShagswell,null,null,"That Luiz/Matic combo is very situational.  It's perfect for playing against a 4-4-2 like City runs.  It forces every midfield player into a 2 vs. 1 scenario: Silva against Ivanovic and Luiz/Matic, Navas against Azpilicueta and Luiz/Matic, or Toure/Demechellis against Luiz and Matic.  When City inevitably gives up possession, there is tons of space to exploit, as there is no more than one of City's central midfielders hanging back to defend.  So that gives our D-mids four options going forward and only five players to beat tops (there could be fewer if City's fullbacks overlapped).  Most of our attacking players can win a 1 vs 1 scenario with relative ease, so any of our defensive players can play the ball forward and watch the magic happen.

Unfortunately, this strategy is only tailor-made to beat a 4-4-2. While we could use against a team that runs this formation like Tottenham, it probably won't work too well against a team with a five-man midfield.  With two holding midfielders in the center of the park employing such a rigid strategy, we'll run into trouble on the break.  Instead of only two center backs, one central midfielder, and 0-2 fullbacks, we now have an additional central midfielder to beat.  This clogs up the midfield and makes playing longer passes to our attacking players difficult.  Against the standard 4-2-3-1 or any variation of a five-man midfield, our Matic/Luiz tactic will look like a rigid anti-football style of play.  There simply isn't enough space to whack the ball at Willian, Hazard, Eto'o, or Ramires when there's an extra man covering the central zones.  We would need a smoother transition from defense to attack because space in the middle of the park will be limited and the defense will be harder to break down.  Additionally, it puts our central attacking midfielder against two d-mids, so it's easier for them to keep possession in the middle of the field as well.

TL;DR: Matic/Luiz works against 4-4-2's because there's enough space for direct counterattacks.  More fluidity is needed if the opposition clogs the midfield.",0,1391568059,null,0,false,0,cf7bgif,t3_1x0fcv,t1_cf7bgif,t3_1x0fcv,null,1432256795,45,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,45

His off the ball movement isnt up to our standard.

Theres a reason they have struggled without Michu.

There are two players we could use. Ben Davies and Nathan Dyer. Both would be an upgrade to what we have or at least give us some depth. Ben Davies and Rose are probably at the same level and i rate Nathan Dyer higher than Lennon.

Theres also Michu and Vorm, but we already have enough midfielders and Vorm is only interesting if Lloris leaves.

Unless Michu wants to play as a striker like he did earlier for Swansea.",0,1391568302,null,0,false,0,cf7bkkh,t3_1x0fqy,t1_cf7bkkh,t1_cf71894,null,1432256847,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

Charles N’Zogbia is expected to play for Aston Villa again this season after Paul Lambert dismissed suggestions the injured winger’s claret and blue career is over.

N’Zogbia has been out of action since July after rupturing his Achilles heel during a pre-season jog while on holiday in Miami.

There were strong rumours N’Zogbia was no longer in Lambert’s plans after he was given the ‘Bomb Squad’ treatment and stripped of his number.

But Lambert is hopeful the 27-year-old wideman will return to action before the end of the campaign as he steps up his rehabilitation.

Asked if the number situation with N’Zogbia carried any significance, Lambert replied: “No, you’re looking for something that’s not there.           

“The lad’s hurt his Achilles and we’ve got to get him back fit. He’s doing really well.

“You would think he would play before the end of the season, yes, but it’s not nice, that injury. I think his Achilles heel just went and once you get that it’s a major injury.”

With Villa failing to recruit a No.10 style playmaker during last month’s window it seems Lambert is prepared to give N’Zogbia’s creative potential another chance.

“You’re right, when you have those sort of players coming at you, you know you can score,” said Lambert.

“I think I’ve said before, if you damage your Achilles heel, it’s a major injury.

“Sometimes you’re better off having a straight break rather than that injury because it’s a nightmare.

“He’s doing well. He’s just started back with the fitness lads, doing little bits, but his match fitness is not there.

“He’s not really done training or anything. He’s just getting the fitness levels up a little bit.’’

Lambert confirmed N’Zogbia sustained the serious injury during an innocuous exercise session in the States as he tried to get in shape ahead of returning to Bodymoor Heath last summer.

“I think he did it on a jog,” added Lambert. “He was running. I think every player does that in pre-season.

“They go out for a jog just to get going again and maybe your legs just aren’t as good as what they were during the season. It can happen that, from a really simple jog you can hurt yourself.

“That’s it, I just need to get him fit.”",0,1391568717,null,0,false,0,cf7brg6,t3_1x1o4z,t1_cf7brg6,t3_1x1o4z,null,1432256937,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1
