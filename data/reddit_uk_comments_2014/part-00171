For one thing, the problem of cross contamination doesn't just arise from washing chickens, it arises from handling them and then inadequately cleaning – or not cleaning at all – hands and/or contact surfaces. People working in professional food preparation may be well versed in the proper procedures, but the vast majority of ordinary folks have no idea. They think rinsing their hands under the hot water tap is sufficient, when it actually requires thorough scrubbing to be sure. 

For another, it shifts the blame for any public health issues caused by cross contamination from producers onto consumers. It promotes the belief that it's okay for them to deliver a dangerous product because only foolish people will be harmed – or will *do* harm – by it.

In the technical sense, there has never been a communist or anarchist state. In the popularist sense, there have been communist states, but again no anarchist states.

Communist states (again in the popular sense) have many many flaws, but it is worth considering that a) for a considerable period of time the USSR had a more powerful economy than the rest of the world put together, and b) the second largest national economy on the planet right now is communist. Does that mean we should be a communist country? Hell no - I don't think that for a moment. Does that mean we should consider them and potentially integrate certain lessons from their ideologies? Absolutely.

As for anarchist states, there's very little evidence that they do or don't work, so to say they are ""failed"" is a total misnomer. The closest that mankind has gotten to an anarchist state was the Free Territory in the Ukraine - a society which was, according the more reliable reports of the time, a great success, but which was invaded and occupied and dissolved by burgeoning soviet states.

So feel free to disagree with those forms of government, but to refer to them as ""failed"" (indicating that they have been tried and found lacking) is a bit misguided.",0,1402939329,null,0,false,0,ci9143k,t3_2891zo,t1_ci9143k,t1_ci8zccb,null,1434264466,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

There is only one Kingdom now, the United Kingdom.

Obviously the term ""United Kingdom"" came about to reflect the fact that 3 previously separate kingdoms (or 2, depending on how you count it) are now united into a single kingdom. So perhaps it would be a bit strange to continue to call it the UK when it only contains the complete territory of one of those former kingdoms.

But on the other hand, technically speaking it is still a kingdom that is united.

What I suspect would actually happen is that the full name of the UK would not change immediately. There would be discussions about a name change that wouldn't get anywhere for many years.

I think a name change will happen more organically. Over time people would settle on a name for the UK minus Scotland, and eventually the official name will change to reflect that.

Road closures, deliberately inconvenient one way systems, removal of free street parking etc etc.

The latest 20 mph plan is ridiculous. It will increase congestion (50% more cars on the road at any time due to longer journey times at slower speeds, more traffic jams as a result, more fuel burnt, more pollution, less observance and respect for speed limits, more disgruntled residents.

true,Lit-Up,null,null,"&gt; No need to tar the wider unionist or protestant communities with the same brush.

As I already stated - the DUP and UUP have the lion's share of the unionist vote and are therefore ""mainstream"" unionists and represent ""the wider unionist or protestant communities"". I know you're trying to say that sane, moderate unionists are the majority but that simply isn't an *electoral fact*.  Until ""the wider unionist or protestant communities"" stop voting for DUP/UUP then they will automatically be tarred with the same policies, including tolerance of (and active participation with) loyalist shitstirring. What other possible conclusion can one come to? A vote for the DUP is a vote for bigotry - it always was, always will be. The numbers suggest most unionists vote for them.

&gt;  and paint all that crap as something unionism and protestants as a whole are behind. 

Again, not enough condemnation from mainstream unionist parties to put clear blue water between the two. The whole ""Protestant Unionist Loyalist"" moniker is of course uncritical as it combines three categories into one hence distorting the nuances between them, however mainstream unionist parties don't emphasise these nuances enough, because ultimately they benefit from a combined unionist vote (hence why 'unionist unity' is often on the agenda)

&gt; I doubt most mainstream unionists would have agreed with any of that crap, and wouldn't want any part of what the self described loyalists have been getting up to, even if some of their leaders were clearly egging the loyalists on.

There's nothing to say that there's a gulf between the leadership and the other party reps within these parties. The ranks of NI21 and Alliance have hardly been flooded with former DUP/UUP representatives... Basil and John are two lonely examples.

How do you decide who owns what land? At the moment the government decides with land deeds and things. What does ""own"" even mean? Do those people who have fucked us over through state influence for so long and own so much under state-capitalism just get to keep everything they obtained through it?

IMO, ideally a replacement for Johnson would be first choice at RB, with Flanagan as backup. In the middle, Sakho on the left and a new CB on the right. At LB, Moreno (pleeeeease) and Enrique backup.

Then behind all of them we have players like Kelly (unfortunately, a permacrock. He'll undoubtedly be injured again, as much as I hate to say it) and Wisdom, who may go out on loan again. Agger and/or Skrtel 2nd choice, and Flanagan  third-choice at LB  behind Moreno and Enrique (as well as being 2nd choice at RB, like I said earlier).

All in all, I just want someone to come in at CB and partner Sakho. I've never really grown on Skrtel and Agger playing together. There's a reason we started conceding goals left and right when Hyypia (and later, Carra) left. Neither of them has the leadership qualities to get the defence together and hold them accountable. Hell, even in 12/13 we had to bring Carragher back into the side because we needed him. Sakho is 23 or 24. He's our future. Skrtel and Agger have had a good run in the side and we've never been that successful when they play together.

No one said you couldn't? Again, if you are going to endorse capitalism, sweatshops for mass production of clothing(and in other cases: other things) through cheap labor are one of its consequences.

&gt; In fact, Nike could still turn a profit whilst obeying labour laws... slightly less, but a profit all the same... but they don't.

Speaking of ""false dilemma"", you might want to provide proof for a claim like this. Also, public companies(as in stock market listed companies) are all about profit optimization. Nike only profited on a bit under 10% of its total revenue(meaning they had to spend $24.4 billion out of their total $27 billion fiscal year revenue to operate their business). You want to profit as much as you can so your stock can generally improve as well, thus making the shareholders richer(which can include Nike sponsored companies/funds). There is no space for ""Nike could still turn a profit"", every dollar made is a dollar that should be saved(public corporation motto). Please restrain from commentating on these topics, or at least inform yourself first.

&gt; Also, as a large American company, it can be argued that Nike doesn't just play the game but also helps set the rules.

Online abuse serves no purpose other than to allow the perpetrators an opportunity to chimp out. There is no ulterior motive, and everyone online has such abuse directed at them regardless of gender, race or background.

I think they overpaid, though.

Apparently Saints want something like £30m for Luke Shaw. You would probably get more mileage out of Shaw than Filipe Luis and there are the added bonuses of him being English and whatever. 

That much (£27 - 30m) could also potentially lure a club like Real Madrid to drop Coentrão who played like 10 games last season. Again, probably more mileage out of Coentrão than Luis.

It essentially sets out on paper things that are either a) glaringly obvious things that don't even need to be written down - like the rule of law applying from day one of independence, b) things that are already the case or c) SNP political objectives (like *a commitment to negotiate the removal of trident*). 

I think if there is any real story in this, then it is actually their precise wording about Trident... To me, this reads as a significant softening of the SNP position. Previously they always have talked about ""removing trident"" as a no-brainer. Now suddenly it seems to be about *""negotiation""*. Essentially their constitutional commitment would be to talk about removing trident - not a commitment to actually achieving it, and certainly not in any sort of time frame. It strikes me the SNP are positioning themselves now so that, in the unlikely event of a yes vote, they have some room to maneuver... since they themselves probably appreciate that Trident is going to be on the Clyde for some significant time to come - for complex economic, international and technical reasons that are largely beyond the control of either Holyrood or Westminster. 

Why is that a big deal? Because of all the SNPs crazy policies, removing Trident from the Clyde is one that is fairly universally popular in Scotland (because *""nuclear weapons are bad""* is an easy-sell message to undereducated provincial types that have little understanding of what nuclear weapons actually do, or how they work and often conflate them with the safety issues associated with nuclear power out of ignorance).",0,1402952478,null,0,1402952763,0,ci97vzj,t3_28ahne,t1_ci97vzj,t3_28ahne,null,1434267724,-5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-5

i personally don't think mignolet is a good keeper, let alone great. in fact i don't even think mingolet is good enough to be our no.2 keeper. But most people on the sub are so in love with mignloet it actually sickens me to read the totally and utter bullshit.        

Mignolet made a few good saves, and yes saved that pen on the opening day and from then on i think a lot of fans have fallen in unconditional love for him. Ive been watching our previous games the season just gone on LFCTV religiously and the mistakes mignolet makes is truly disturbing. Mings has no authority over our defence, lacks distribution and decision making. Yet renia was such a presence for us, he held our back line together and truly screamed and shouted at everyone constantly! where as mings barely talks to anyone, let alone shout! when renia use to concede a goal, you could see it in his face how pissed he was, we use to beat himself up after conceding one goal, last season watching mingolet after we conceded he pulls a face like ""oh well"" and just looks sorry for himself!                          

Im a massive and i mean MASSIVE liverpool fan and when i watch mings near the ball, I panic... and anyone who disagrees I advise you to watch some more of our games last season and focus on the guy.. he makes huge fundamental keeper mistakes.            


Ive mentioned this around 5 times on the sub and i mostly get down voted. But Im just baffled by the way most fans have turned their back on a keeper who had been a total boss for us FOR YEARS, and praise a keeper who is MASSIVELY over-rated and in my opinion cost us the season. (YES THATS RIGHT I SAID IT! - put it in simpler terms.... everyone says we lost the season cause of our defence right? 3 seasons ago we were known for having one of the best defensive records in the league... and who did we have in defence then?

Baines has been the best left-back in the best domestic league in the world the last two seasons, his starting position in the England squad is completely justified.  He was completely hung out to dry against Italy both offensively and defensively.  Defensively he had no support from midfield and was constantly 1v2 or 1v3; this meant he was unable to risk venturing forward and contribute to the attacks, and on the rare occasion he was able to his teammates (particularly Sterling) ignored him and lost the ball.

England are and always will be shit if their ""star"" players continue to have their egos unjustifiably inflated by massive paychecks and television ""experts"" whose only true purpose is to promote the wealthiest clubs which bring in the highest ratings.  The whole system is rotten to the core and I'm fucking sick of it.  It's just a shame that talented but humble players such as Baines and Jagielka are made scapegoats for the inevitable failure of England's overhyped players to meet the unrealistic expectations of the British media.

I'm pointing out that it is easier to sell the message of *""nuclear weapons are bad""* to under-educated localists than it is to give them the knowledge to understand that they are extremely safe, inert things unless used purposefully. Perhaps even more challenging is the concept of nuclear weapons as a device with a ""functional"" use as a weapon, whose real purpose is actually quite different... infact if we ever reach a point where we have to use a nuclear weapon as a mechanical weapon then it's real purpose has long since failed... which is to provide a deterrent against aggression.

Say what you will about the horrors of the modern world, the middle east and conflicts in S.East Asia, but the world has never known peace like it has the past 60 years. No two major powers have come to blows and that's remarkably impressive... certainly for the history of Europe. I can't recall a time in history where Europe has known such peace as it has the last 60 years, even considering civil war in the Balkans. Don't forget, that in the 5 years before the invention of nuclear weapons, 2.5% of the worlds population died in a horrific total-war. People tend to forget that.

To say that all people who disagree fall into the group of being ignorant is your own inference. I'm just pointing out that selling messages to ignorant people is what straw polls like this referendum are all about - and the nuclear one works well in Scotland because it has ample supply of people who dislike nuclear weapons for reasons which, when challenged, don't in my experience tend to hold up and are often born out of misunderstanding.

You're slightly missing the point that some people's objections may in fact be based on the idea of them being used.

I'm sure that'll be of great comfort to the people who die.

Schools will have someone escort you at all times and won't let you be alone with kids. They'll do a list check (there's a number like 65 but I can't remember it) which is sort of like a short term dbs check to make sure you haven't walked out of the nearest prison.Secondly, call them and explain who you are, say you want some experience in a school and that if possible, could they kindly put you on the phone why with the person who deals with this sort of thing? You'll get a receptionist who'll say she'll pass on your message and get someone to call you back. No one will. Keep trying. Best time is about half an hour after school finishes, but try lots of different times if you can. And keep calling. Its the only way, because emails will get buried.Thirdly, make sure you know why you want the experience, and tell them why. And don't go for your old school either.Hope this helps!

It is not nearly as clear-cut as a jogger being violently assaulted by a complete stranger and violated.

In a situation where you have a current sexual relationship with somebody more information is needed - was the act consensual and later she changed her mind? Did they previously discuss sex-during-sleep (as unlikely as you think that may be some couples do discuss it)? Did the act occur at all?

And one wonders why the women didn't call the police at the time. How could he escape the country if such a serious incident occurred?

I'm not an Assange fan, so I wouldn't know. 

&gt; Why say the girl, when there were clearly two?

I was clearly referring to one incident, the torn condom claim. But both claims are addressed here:

http://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/17/julian-assange-sweden

&gt; Early the next morning, Miss W told police, she had gone to buy breakfast before getting back into bed and falling asleep beside Assange. She had awoken to find him having sex with her, she said, but when she asked whether he was wearing a condom he said no. ""According to her statement, she said: 'You better not have HIV' and he answered: 'Of course not,' "" but ""she couldn't be bothered to tell him one more time because she had been going on about the condom all night. She had never had unprotected sex before.""

&gt; In submissions to the Swedish courts, they have argued that Miss W took the initiative in contacting Assange, that on her own account she willingly engaged in sexual activity in a cinema and voluntarily took him to her flat where, **she agrees, they had consensual sex**. They say that she never indicated to Assange that she did not want to have sex with him. They also say that **in a text message to a friend, she never suggested she had been raped and claimed only to have been ""half asleep""**.

I think it's the idea of washing off any chemicals, cleaning products or general factory slime from being produced and packaged. Also removing any left over innards at the same time.

If you are very careful, even if it doesn't produce any actual positive results, it is absolutely fine to wash a chicken. 

The reason they give this kind of advice is because statistically some people will just splash it everywhere and contaminate other stuff with their hands.

Some people might even use their washing up bowl, or not have a washing up bowl for plates etc.

&gt;but 20 million pounds for someone turning 30 is daylight robbery.

Well, he's 28 for one thing. 20 millions pounds for the best available player in that position doesn't sound too bad. I'd prefer David Alaba but other than that I can't really think of anyone better.

Cesc is home-grown and, we don't actually need that many home grown players. We can't name more than 17 foreign players over 21.

He could also become the next Steve Sidwell, or just not develop beyond the high - but not world class level which he's playing currently.

50% less money on a better player.

Who won't be a huge Torresian burden if he's just not that good.

You are right, my mistake, he is 28 but will be 29 by the time the season starts.

&gt; He could also become the next Steve Sidwell, or just not develop beyond the high - but not world class level which he's playing currently.
 
Anyone can turn out to play badly, even Luis. But just like Filipe will almost certainly not flop in the EPL, Shaw will most likely not stop improving his already great play. He would start on every single team in the EPL except Everton and *maybe* City and Arsenal.

&gt; 50% less money on a better player.

I think your math is off. Unless we are suddenly spending 40 million pounds on Shaw.

&gt; Who won't be a huge Torresian burden if he's just not that good.

I don't understand what you mean by this? I don't think anyone expects Filipe Luis to not be good. Actually quite the contrary, I expect him to do great. But that doesn't change the fact that he will only last a few seasons before we have to buy another LB.

And that last part I am not sure what you are trying to say, but Filipe Luis is both a great defender and a great attacker which is what I was getting at in comparison with Azpi on the left side.

But, just as women have the right to choose to cover their legs (I'd prefer short skirts every day of the year, personally) they also have the right to cover their hair.

The fact that he is good, still in his teens and would start for almost every single team in the EPL. Him being a Chelsea fan is also a bonus. 

&gt; Luis is such a phenomenal signing I actually find it frustrating that people don't understand how good he is.

I have seen very few people who say that he isn't a great player. To me he is easily one of the best LBs in the world, but that doesnt mean we should have shelled out an insane amount of money on him.

&gt; That's not really a problem though, left backs tend to be cheap.

Finding a good, young LB is what has been difficult, not finding a cheap one.

The club could not be put into the position of finding a last minute keeper or waiting to see if they had a first choice keeper come fall. The new first choice would need time to settle in and would need to know that he was first choice. Then, Reina didn't get his move, and suddenly we have a problem. You can't have two first choice keepers- not on their wages at a club like Liverpool. So who leaves? The guy that put us in this position and was declining in performance.

Look, I love Reina, and I always will remember all the good times he had with the club, but Mignolet is our keeper now. He's young, an excellent shot stopper, and will only get better. His distribution will get better with time (and is minimized by Gerrard sitting deep.) Mignolet didn't lose us the season; in fact, he earned us points on his own.

You're free to disagree, but Mignolet is a top keeper who is getting better and hopefully will be our keeper for a long time.",0,1402965906,null,0,false,0,ci9eae9,t3_28a4g6,t1_ci9eae9,t1_ci9859q,null,1434270806,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

true,justthisplease,null,null,"""Increasing the penalty wont change that"" - I totally disagree. First you said they do it because they think they won't get caught, so increase the likely hood of them getting caught and increase the penalty and they wont do it. The PM proposals would do that in theory as investors money is at risk so the investors will demand more transparency with what is happening with the money and more accountability when it goes wrong. Now you can put money in a savings account in a bank and whatever happens the government would pay you up to £85k. 

You also do not know how wide spread the practices were in the companies, obviously the companies would prefer to scapegoat individuals.

And just because we cant make something perfect i.e. 100% independent we can definitely make it better than the system now i.e. 100% doggy, nontransparent, undemocratic. The committee would be a work in progress like every democratic organisation, the public would be able to see how it functions and understand economics better. We all know the USA democratic system is corrupt, but the UK system is different and not as bad, this is [Lord Turner's take on that issue] (http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/01/10/adair-turners-denunciation-of-the-banking-lobby/) I have faith the UK would be  better than the USA, although nothing is perfect.

I think it is a travesty that around 85% (guess) of people have no idea how money is created and no idea how this impacts our lives on a daily basis. More knowledge, transparency and bringing the process under democratic scrutiny has to be a good thing IMO. There is no God given right that private corporations should control 97% of the money supply. In fact I would go as far as saying that there is a right for the people to determine how the countries money is created and I would be astounded if any normal person thought the current system was a good idea.

As you have accepted PMs argument of how money is created (Endogenous Money Theory), that is all I can ask.

true,rev9of8,null,null,"Yes there damn well was good reason to doubt what the government was saying. 

People seem to have forgotten that there were actually two dossiers produced by the government - one in around Sept 02 and another in, IIRC, Feb 03.

At the time, the Feb '03 dossier was originally referred to as the 'dodgy dossier' because it was cribbed from a well-old student's doctoral thesis and misrepresentations of articles in Janes. But that dossier has largely been forgotten.

However, it was the Sep '02 dossier that resulted in the secret briefings to the press that provided for the much-ridiculed 45 minute story. We later discovered that much of the '02 dossier was provided by the Cureveball source. Nowadays when people speak about the 'dodgy dossier' they mean this first dossier.

But as a result of the publication of that dossier, Hussein allowed a sizeable cadre of journalists to inspect sites that had been identified in the dossier as being those sites the British government had strong intelligence as either currently or recently most likely to have been used for the production of chemical weapons.

The journalists were allowed to take their own experts along and were allowed to pick the sites they visited each morning if I remember correctly. At none of the sites that the British government had claimed in the dossier was any evidence whatsoever of any recent activity found - it was obvious in all cases that the sites visited had long since been abandoned yet these were the sites the British government was claiming were the most likely to be being used currently or recently for chemical weapons production. These were the sites were the dossier claimed the intelligence was strongest.

Because of things like this, it was obvious to more than a few of us that the intelligence the government was claiming to have was utterly piss-poor and caused us to question whether Iraq had any chemical or biological weapons capability. Of course, we all much later learnt that the intelligence had simply been fabricated out of whole cloth by Curveball.

Claims that we all believed the intelligence and claims and that we had no reason to doubt them are nothing more than revisionist bolllocks.

An argument at least would have *some* objective data behind it that one could look at.  You don't even have that and you're actively avoiding the opportunity I'm giving you to *look* at the data we have that shows that governments are dangerous and murderous.

Since you won't guess, I will tell you. From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democide#Research_on_democide: ""After studying over 8,000 reports of government-caused deaths, Rummel estimates that there have been **262 million victims** of democide in the last century. According to his figures, *six times as many people have died from the actions of people working for governments than have died in battle*. ([source](http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM))

There is also strong evidence that the UK is participating in the willful killing of people, such as the [Liverpool ""Care"" Pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Care_Pathway_for_the_Dying_Patient) that actively kills off hundreds of thousands of elderly that the NHS system chooses not to give care to.

No one can say that violence will ever be totally eliminated, but what we can do is stop blindly trusting in pervasive and persistent violence that governments commit every day just by virtue of them existing. I am sorry that you feel like you don't have to do the research into the objective evidence that shows exactly how much death results from government... while pretending that you have any idea that a free and voluntary society would turn out.",0,1402969790,null,0,false,0,ci9g0nj,t3_289gpa,t1_ci9g0nj,t1_ci9fnwz,null,1434271621,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1

Neither group's behaviour can be predicted by economic models.

Your words not mine. If you're in front of two doorways leading to other rooms - you can clearly see a mugger standing in one room but the other is dark and unknown - don't you at least take a chance and go into the unknown? I am not making promises or ""pie in the sky"" claims here... I'm pointing out that the current system is violent and dangerous (and that you, by supporting it are condoning violence), and asking you to reevaluate your support of the violent system. Your fear of losing government right now will change to fear of keeping it the more you look at the reality around you.

Scarcity is a fact of nature, and will never change. It is absolutely true that resources are limited, but human desire is infinite. The best system for fulfilling the desires of the most people in the most peaceful way is to recognize their right to own their body and the productive results of how they use their bodies. You let people collect resources, and trade freely. The system adjusts prices based on the efforts and needs of the people participating it, and results in the most ""fair"" allocation of scarce resources. This mechanism has been well-understood for centuries. 

What you *do not* do is give the power of choice to a small group of people... they will always use that power to give themselves as much as possible and to maintain the system as it is.

http://youtu.be/jHXLaio8G3I

It's a bullshit argument but nonetheless it is the explicit reason he gave for his actions. 

She is not defending those actions she is merely stating what is being said in these videos. 

&gt;*The impression is created that all Muslims who are critical of the impact of foreign policy – and certainly any Muslim who recognises the rights of those in Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq to resist the occupation of their countries – give succour to those who preach the language of violent extremism here.*

So recognising the right to resist an occupying force makes you an extremist now. 

Those Palestinian protesters who campaign against Israel illegally building on and occupying the occupied territories but don't support Hamas are extremists? 

The French and Dutch resistance in world war two were extremists?

All those who supported the cause for a United Ireland while condemning the actions of the IRA are now extremists. 

This is what that article is suggesting.

So if you are going to make a valid case that Yaqoob is an islamist I want your definition of what an islamist is so that we can compare her words and actions against that definition.

Yes there are background checks for rental, you'll probably have to pay upfront since they won't be able to do one on a non-resident. Of course you will have to pay utilities unless your rent is inclusive of those costs, you might want to look into temporary accommodation since it'll most likely be furnished and inclusive of utilities, as well as having a shorter minimum term of contract. 

Some questions are worrying? Why do you think that anyone on this forum is going to know about a town with 25,000 people in it? Where do you get ""groceries""? At the shops like you would anywhere else. Yes this town is small a quick google could answer that... of course shops accept cards unless they're small corner shops of whatever. You can't drive without a licence, if you get caught you could get deported. Will you need a car? Well only you can answer that, you're going to be in a village, do you want to do a lot of visiting other places whilst you're here? How do you intend to get a car in the first place, buying one is probably not possible for you without the necessary documentation. Then you need insurance and road tax and MOT etc. Rental is possible but expensive. You could get a series of trains to the town you're planning on going to from London. First to Nottingham and then to Kirkby.

Eh, not upset about it. Provided some amusement.

That's not what the downvote is for. The downvote is not an ""I don't like this."" button. It's meant for posts or topics which are off topic or don't contribute to the community. And I'm not the type to downvote and move on. I hate that. If I downvote, I explain why I downvoted.

Again, not shitting on anyone's parade. Just because I'm not jumping in on the parade does not mean I'm shitting on it.

Further, an affection for the American team seems utterly harmless, unless you're a German/Portuguese/Ghanaian supporter obviously-- klinsmann is a legend at our club, despite only playing two full seasons with us-- a testament to his character.  

Finally, while I am sympathetic that not all American fans are at the same level as some more seasoned European supporters, a great deal try hard to learn, and a great many more are exceptionally well informed. We have a smaller community than some teams who wear red or blue and are much more numerous and ignorant when it comes to their American supporters. One of my favorite things about this club is that it feels like a community, so don't be unwelcoming of people who want to be here. You come off like a supporter of one a ""them""

Dempsey accomplished more than KPB at Spurs obviously, but in terms of their tenure at WHL, they were roughly equal. KPB was a promising youngster we brought from Germany that unfortunately didn't pan out for us here. Dempsey was a useful squad player that made about 30 appearances for us and scored a few goals. Berbatov was one of the most talented and prolific players we've had in living memory and played a huge part in the last piece of silverware we won and almost qualifying for the Champions League in 2007 and then left for a massive amount of money.

true,mookx,null,null,"These kind of social anxiety issues aren't going to be cured by anything I can say. But my wife has similar issues--she dreads social interactions and is terrified of small talk. But despite this she has been able to move to another country, start her own business, raise two kids, and make me happier than I ever thought anyone could. 

A big part of her success has been counseling and a good zoloft prescription. The zoloft leveled off the highs and lows, which wasn't so great for real happiness but it allowed her to slowly adjust her thinking over time and get over some of the anxiety. The mind is like a massive, slowly flowing river--you can't change much in a day, but if you carefully work on re-routing it, over the course of several years you can improve. She hasn't used zoloft for 6 or 7 years now. 

Assuming you follow my advice and go down this route as a long-term strategy, in the short term you really need to work on acquiring some skills. Ok, so you don't want to talk to people. Develop some skills you can learn on your own. Becoming a good freelance software coder is just a matter of reading, thinking, and doing. Online marketing, graphic design, freelance writing....thanks to the internet there are lots of opportunities out there for you to become remarkable at something without leaving your couch. The problem is you've conflated all possible success as contingent on social interaction, and that's a copout. Your anxiety (and likely consequent depression) is giving you a mental free pass to laziness. You can't talk to people, therefore you can't do anything. You need to turn that shit around and realize your handicap is an extra hurdle most of us don't have, and therefore you need to work a lot fucking harder at working on these non-social skills because it's the only shot you have at happiness. 

You are like the vet who has lost a leg. Laying in bed doing nothing is never going to get him anywhere. He needs to work that much harder with his remaining leg or he's going to waste his life. There is a lot of your mind that isn't crippled with anxiety if you just challenge it to do something. Become excellent at something, and as a bonus you will be surprised at how this competence can become a crutch for you in social situations. People are less terrifying when you clearly better at them in some context.

The 90% line was at a different draft, and most of the agreement is essentially propping up the status quo.

Also I think you miss the point of the process, there was supposed to be an agreement everyone could get on board with, when parties representing over 50% of the population said no it doesn't say much for a consensus, not to mention the Alliance didn't sign up fully either. You also miss the nature of a compromise, both sides reduce their demands and give a little bit in return, demanding less isn't a compromise. Where was Unionism's gain in the final draft?

In the short term, can you try to force yourself to start having interactions you don't necessarily need to get yourself into a habit, such as conversing with shopkeepers, calling utility companies on your parents behalf to pay bills etc? Most things get better with practice, even if the fear of them is crippling. Try to make yourself have at least one interaction every few days, and slowly build up from there. Note: I'm not a counsellor! But I do think you'd benefit from counselling of some sort on this matter. A little each day is what's needed, small baby steps will lead to progress.

You seem like a humble person and I don't sniff the slightest sense of entitlement from you, so I think you'll be okay once you get past your biggest hurdle. 

You may need to do some volunteer work initially to get work experience as you have no qualifications; charity shop work, working with children, volunteering at a homeless shelter - think about what may make you the least uncomfortable; perhaps volunteering on the Samaritan's helpline so you don't have person-to-person interaction too much (except I guess you'd have to work from their offices).

That's not going to happen. We don't have many 'funny farms' these days, and those we do have usually contain those who are a danger to themselves or others. 

Good luck OP. I have faith that things will turn out well for you.

Also, head over to /r/beermoney where you can make money from your computer, it may help ease the burden you feel if you can give a little back to your parents. Also, Project Gutenberg are always looking for contributors to type up pages of books; I realise that's not a big thing, but at least when you get to the stage of creating a CV you can say you collaborated on something - the most important thing in your situation is to show a willingness to learn and to do things - that's the attitude which will get you a job.

I know exactly what to do if a pipe bursts, because when it happened, I phoned my dad and asked him.

Complete independence is touted as the most important thing a person over the age of about twenty should have, but that's nonsense. Yes, you should probably have a job and money coming in (by the way, you're probably going to want to at least get GCSE Maths and English, a *lot* of employers ask for those), and be able to take care of yourself on a daily basis, but a huge part of the reason humans build social relationships is so we have people to help us out when we need them. You do somebody a favour like helping them move, and other people think of you as a helpful person and are more likely to do you favours. You ask your parents to help you out now, and when they're older and less able you help them out, and you pass on the things you've learnt to your own children, if you have them.

You're probably the kind of person who would gain a lot from the right kind of volunteering, assuming you can overcome your nervousness in starting. Find something you're interested in, stick at it, and reap the rewards in terms of social skills and confidence.

It would have to be a heck of a strong belief though - something like 99.5% of Muslims against gay marriage before youhave a10% chance of seeing that result.Since I got three 'hits' in three trials, it makes it very, very unlikely that the first explanation is correct (that the vast majority of Muslims disapprove of gay marriage) which makes the second explanation extremely likely.

true,who8877,null,null,"&gt; So - that does raise the question, how are the super wealthy paid with out being paid via quite so highly taxable means?

The super wealthy generally don't ""work"" for a living.  They've accumulated enough capital assets that they live almost entirely off of capital gains and dividends.  In essence they are full time investors theoretically distributing capital to the best places (when they fail at this they tend not to be rich much longer).

The US does have some rather strange laws that allow hedge fund managers to get taxed as capital gains and not income - however I don't think there is anything equivalent in the UK.

&gt; That also raises the question couldn't the company deliberately over pay knowing they would take the hit on of the tax aka, pay £1,000,000 in shares, knowing the value after tax would be accurate for the intended payment (I guess this would be akin to net income vs gross income)

I think you are describing a tax gross up - sometimes companies will do this.  Meaning they say they give you £1,000,000 but actually give you £1,450,000 (not exact but I'm lazy) such that minus taxes it equates to £1,000,000.  However that is more the way they are phrasing the compensation - tax wise its them giving the employee £1,450,000.

Generally this is only done for things like travel expense reimbursement that still falls under taxable income for whatever reason.",0,1402991186,null,0,false,0,ci9niw0,t3_289ls0,t1_ci9niw0,t1_ci9nf2x,null,1434275224,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Using house price to annual salary ratio (which I think is a more informative measure of actual price), in the North it went from like 4 down to 3.  That's a big fall, and long term I think the measure has tended to hover around 3-3.5.

However around London/S.E the ratio dropped from 7 down to 5.5, but has since climbed up to 8.  Admittedly London is kind of odd, and there are probably all sorts of wildly expensive houses being sold that distort those numbers (unless they cut out the top 5% of sales, say) along with all sorts of god knows what other london-only factors.  Before the house market fucked up in the late 80's the ratio was around 6.

Any rise in rates could screw a lot of people.

&gt;__Council Tax__ is the system of local [taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation) used in [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England),  [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland)  and [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales)  to part fund the services provided by local government in each country. It was introduced in 1993 by the [Local Government Finance Act 1992](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government_Finance_Act_1992), as a successor to the unpopular [Community Charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Charge), which briefly replaced the older system of [domestic rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_rates_in_the_United_Kingdom); these changes were never applied to [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland), which continues to use a system of [domestic rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_rates_in_Northern_Ireland). The basis for the tax is residential property, with discounts for single occupants. As of 2011, the average annual levy on a property in England was £1,196.

Your best bet for living in that area would be a bedsit/houseshare or something similar for 6 months, then you're just paying the landlord all in for your accommodation and dont have to take out utilities. There should be plenty in and around Kirkby.
Dont worry about getting a license. Your US one will be fine for 6 months. I wouldnt expect to get pulled over anyway, ive been driving for 9 years and have never been pulled over.
Best bet for travel would be National Express Bus, from Heathrow/Gatwick to Mansfield.

The house drops in price, and your equity, is the first to go, that's one thing if it's equity from increasing prices, but another if that's just the deposit you saved hard for, or worse, money you don't have.
Through the North and Wales house prices haven't risen in years, and in many cases have dropped already. ANy further drop will see people having lost all they've put in already.

If you're in negative equity, you aren't just in position of having to save a new deposit, you have to save out the negative equity first, then save a new deposit. You're worse off then a first time buyer, despite have already successfully saved a deposit.

It seems to me that the recent NHS changes have been driven by cost/benefit analysis. Instead of trying to be perfect for everyone (which was the unwritten goal before), treatments are allocated by its cost, the number of people it serves and (I hate to say it) how ""important"" those people are to society. I honestly believe there is eg systemic ageism in the NHS, where the elderly who provide less economic benefit, are ranked below younger people who are (or will soon be) employed and tax-paying.

I am sure it isn't deliberate, but is rather emergent behaviour from the way NHS resource decision making is set up.

I've heard this a lot and I don't really agree. Whilst going running for 30mins/5k may only burn 400calories which can be eat back easily may look like exercise is pretty ineffective, that's is not what I am suggesting.

The difference between someone who lives an active lifestyle vs a sedentary lifestyle, as I fear modern kids are, is much greater.

Anecdotally, there is a guy at my work who is what I'd describe as sedentary he gets the train to work the train and home and not much else. On the other hand, I cycle and walk everywhere as well as cycle 'hard' as a form of exercise a couple of times a week. I eat WAY more than he does, he's gaining weight, I am loosing it. 

Apply that to kids, when I was young we'd spend our evenings playing out, kicking a football around cycling to places we shouldn't and so on. I am sure some kids still do, but I am also sure plenty of kids don't.

That puts you above quite a lot of people so do see that as a good thing!

&gt;Though if any domestic crises were to befall me at home and I was on my own, such as the boiler breaking down in the middle of winter, or a pipe bursting, [...]. These are things that should be second nature to most functioning adults, but are not to me. 

Trust me they are not! I'm in my late 20's, own my own house and car with a good job. 

My domestic crisis through process is 

1. Panic, if possible get coffee
2. To the Googles - this is either a) a very good thing and provides info to fix it, or b) a very bad thing cause it makes whatever problem I have seem uber scary (e.g. look up a headache and it will tell you that you have cancer not that you need water and nurofen!).
2. Call Dad - freak out down the phone while he offers sensible suggestions. 
3. Listen to Dad and put whatever plan he has in action.

Over time I've learnt  some things (where &amp; how to turn the water off, how to switch the fuses back on, how to blow up a boiler (when to ignore Dad's advise and just call the electrician) but many adults will just call an engineer for any of these issues - British Gas etc do sell support contracts for these things (for a cost).

So, you want to do these things for yourself - this is the first and hardest step - Well Done, you've passed! :-D

Next, well for a job you need some education - base line is generally a GSCE in Maths &amp; English or perhaps look in the Key Skills in Maths/English which are aimed at people without the GSCE's (or you can retake then GCSE's).

You also need to get out there - I know this is not easy and you can and should look for support - speak to your Doctor or a local charity to help with this. Start with volunteering and find somewhere where you can go and help out - even something small will get you out of the house and in the public. You'll start to talk to people and get the all important experience on your CV. Again a local charity might be able to offer ideas for this.

It was still on the original clutch. They absolutely love high mileage.

No doubt people will come out with a long string of hatchbacks but if you're doing 30k a year you want something with plenty of cabin space and comfy seats that you get out at the other end feeling as fresh as you did when you set off and hatchbacks such as the Ford Focus size and smaller don't offer that.

Suppose we have a cancer which automatically kills you after six years, and we can diagnose it immediately. 100% of people survive 5 years, so our healthcare system looks really good.

But then someone in the NHS goes 'You know what, this test we're doing to screen for this cancer isn't actually adding any healthcare; people are still dying six years after catching the disease, we're just diagnosing it earlier'. So the NHS switches to a cheaper test which only catches the cancer two years after it appears. Now our five-year survival rate is 0%, but everyone is exactly as healthy as before.

This is what happens in real life; the Yanks spend a lot of money on fancy diagnostic equipment that catches cancers earlier and earlier, and this leads their five- and ten- years rates to be much better than ours.

&gt; Where do I get my groceries?

Supermarket or local shop

&gt; Will I need to use my credit cards that auto convert?

You'll have problems if they're not chip and pin. Also using your own credit cards from the USA is the most expensive way of spending. They'll screw you on currency conversion and usually charge a transaction fee as well.

&gt; Is this town a small one where many places are cash-only? 

No. We're massively down the road towards a cashless society compared to the USA. Debit and credit card usage is very widespread - 9/10 adults have them and we spend more than three times the EU average using them. Many places will be cash only for  purchases below £5 though. 

&gt; How important is it to have a license in the UK? I mean 2 questions really: how dangerous is it to drive without one

You cannot drive on the road without one. As a foreigner it will be a case of being locked up in a cell in a police station overnight to be put before a judge in a Magistrates Court the following morning if the Police stop you. If your car is uninsured or untaxed it will be seized on the spot by the police and taken to a storage compound where upon you have 14 days to remove it once you've proven it is insured and/or taxed and you'll pay a £150 fee plus daily storage as well. After 14 days its crushed. We're quite strict on enforcement. Oh and DUI is treated completely differently here too. Its an automatic minimum 12 month ban. 

&gt; how likely do I need a car in that area?

You'll find it easier to get around with one.

First of all, get it out of your head that you're falling behind. Life is no race. And there's a bit of a secret everyone's in on: Nobody has any idea what they're fucking doing. Paying bills? Finding a job and a flat? All those things are much easier than they sound, thank god. 

I don't mean to pry, but I'm surprised your parents aren’t charging you rent or something I would have happily sat on my arse as a teenager if my dad hadn’t said “no more pocket money” as soon as I hit 13 and was old enough to get a job. Have you talked to them about how you feel? 

Anyway, it sounds like a lot of your anxieties and insecurities stem from fear of the unknown. You might find cognitive behavioural therapy helpful, as it primarily focuses on changing your attitudes toward certain behaviours. If you go and talk to your GP this is also what they’re likely to suggest. You can also do an online CBT course, but to be honest I really think you need to go and talk to somebody face to face if it’s goin to make any kind of difference.

Try not to get overwhelmed. How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. You can’t panic about cooking and cleaning for yourself until you move out; you can’t move out until you get a steady full-time job; you can’t get a full-time job until you get some qualifications. Right? So all you need to work on right now is qualifications. Just one thing. Easy peasy! You’ve clearly got a good grasp of language and I assume you can work a calculator and Google, so you should look into studying Maths and English GCSEs – you can find evening classes that do this for adult learners. That and a chat with your GP should be your first priority.

Keep us updated on how you get on!

Yes its LEGAL but that's utter bullshit and needs to be fixed.

Yes your right entities operating in the UK do generate some tax - but far less than they would if not using the avoidance schemes for example Amazon pays NI and generates tax on its employment costs; but it also is being given access to the UK market, and access to the markets of the UK should not be tax free and should incur corporation tax.  I totally agree they invest capital in wages and jobs and the VAT on sales, and that's fine.  But to deliberately offshore profits to avoid paying tax despite access to a given market is a joke.

The main point is the people being squeezed in this recession had very little to do with creating it, and are now being forced to pay to fix it.

You really so no looming crisis in the United Kingdom? To take your list and as I see each with doing no on the side research:

* Poverty - rising
* Crime - all time low
* Drug abuse - this needs legislative change to swap from criminal to mental support
* Rising health costs - need to swap around to aim more for preventative care than reactionary - long term change in NHS direction required
* Rising elderly-care costs - not sure how we're going to deal with this on top of everything else

Now the things you haven't mentioned:

* Large scale unemployment which I cannot see ever going back down in percentage points due to automation and many other processes
* Huge lack of housing stock thus massively inflated market, which anyone who owns doesn't want depressed, and everyone else needs depressed - you're going to hurt half your population one way or the other now.",0,1403001900,null,0,false,0,ci9peev,t3_289ls0,t1_ci9peev,t1_ci9p7yj,null,1434276107,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In reality, if treating early makes a difference it would show up in both the survival AND mortality rates. If we see a difference between the survival rates but not the mortality rates for two countries, we can conclude treating early makes no difference to age of death, and we shouldn't pay for earlier diagnosis.

Your second point is also quite interesting; in the UK we typically under-treat prostate cancer compared to the US. This is because prostate cancer is slow-growing and most people will die of something else before they die of prostate cancer. In the US, prostate cancer is aggressively screened for and treated with chemo. This means that in the UK, slightly more people die of prostate cancer than in the US (23.7 per 100,000 compared to 23.0 in America), but almost none of those 23.7 people will have had debilitating chemotherapy, and so will go on to live longer on average. Basically, the UK system always tries to maximise the number of healthy life-years people live, even if that means doing odd things like deliberately setting up the population to die of prostate cancer more often. The US system competes in a much shorter time frame, so the 'appearance' of good medicine is more important (for example aggressively treating everything that might be a cancer, including benign lumps).

Not everyone will be receptive to it, but personally I would like to think that most people care about their kids well-being and so there is an opening there to try and help these people feed their kids better.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"If you're actually being serious and we're dropping jokes, there are two faults with the science in his comment.

One is this one

&gt; A smooth surface — say, of a clean-shaven face — will cause air to stick to the front of it. This increases its wind resistance at high speeds. A clean-shaven player that is running will thus be slowed down as such.

This is kinda true, but neither running through air nor swimming are ""high speeds"". You need the high speed to induce turbulence - without turbulence all you're doing with a rough surface is increasing the surface area for drag and making things less efficient. As water is more viscous than air, you need higher speeds to induce turbulence so the effect lasts even longer. 

The second one is:

&gt; A turbulent boundary layer reduces drag (wind resistance) and thus increases speed.

This statement isn't generally true. Turbulent boundary layers actually massively increase skin friction drag (the drag created by air rubbing against the surface) and decrease form drag (the drag caused by the big low-pressure region that forms in the hole in the air behind the object as it moves). The overall drag is not always reduced by turbulence and depends on the speed and shape. 

For not very aerodynamic shapes like balls the big killer is form drag, which is why you want dimples and stiches. The dimples create turbulence that stops a big low-pressure hole forming behind the ball - this is exactly why you can't kick smooth plastic soccer balls as fast as stitched leather ones. For more aerodynamic shapes, namely things like boats, aeroplanes, and a person swimming, the main form of drag is skin friction so you want things to be as smooth as possible. This also links in with the ""high speeds"" thing, as form drag tends to dominate at higher speeds and skin friction is more of an issue at lower speeds. 

Joking aside (though it was a great joke imo), being hairy doesn't make you faster at running (air resistance isn't that big of a deal for running anyway unless you're in Olympic sprinter territory) and has an even worse impact on swimming (where drag forces are huge and speeds are slow).

true,AliJDB,null,null,"In the UK there are 3 main types of student finance you're able to get. A Tuition Fee Loan, a Maintenance Loan and a Maintenance Grant. 

Tuition Fee Loans cover your tuition fees, and get paid directly to the university, usually at £9000 a year. As long as you are studying your first degree at a university that offers a qualifying course, and you are a UK national (or possibly EU national, though my knowledge on this isn't great) you should qualify for a tuition fee loan, regardless of any savings. 

To qualify for a maintenance loan and maintenance grant you need to be a full time student. This money will be paid directly to you for living expenses, student accomodation, etc. This amount will depend on your household income. You'll have to have someone to support your student finance application (usually your parents, or the parent you live with if they are seperated) and they will have to submit details of their income to Student Finance, who will in turn work out how much of the maintenance loan/grant you are awarded. There is a [Student Finance Calculator](http://www.studentfinance.direct.gov.uk/portal/page?_pageid=153%2C4680136&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL) which may help you estimate how much you will get prior to submitting your application. 

Your personal savings should not have an affect on these 3 main types of student finance. There are many additional bursaries and grants available, some of which you may not qualify for if you have a large amount of savings.

I hope this helps. If you have any more questions about the process etc, holler at me, I just went through the hell that is Student Finance applications, as you might be able to tell.

Even thgough we have the money, we will still try not to pay by their terms and once again lose out a prime target. This despite the fee being agreed which means we have money but are a clusterfuck internally. 

&gt; It seems that we evaluate players at a certain price and don't move past it.

Good, you're saying exactly what I am. We're a joke to an extent.

It covers nothing. You're stating we have money. Then you're stating its the calculations, then you're saying we just ask around for players and dont bid. Is exactly what I'm saying. We have no plan B and when we lose a prime target each time, we end up looking like clowns in the market.

So....we have the money....but we dont....make up your mind.

Suffices to see that you're more or less agreeing that we are a joke in the market. Lowballing, window sopping, not tabling bids, just showing interest, losing out primer targets etc....I'd say we need to sort ourselves out transfer wise.

true,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt; Fascism was originally considered ""the third way"", since it is neither laissez-faire nor communism.

At the time of the rise of fascism and nazism, socialism/communism, liberalism and conservative ideologies were already well established. So third way? Fourth if we're being generous, but in reality the ideological landscape was already vastly more fragmented. 

You may be thinking of Third Position, which was an extreme right, ultra nationalist set of related ideologies that could be seen as proto-fascist/nazist. Their argument was that they were against both socialism and capitalism, and took ideas from both. However Third Position groups are generally ultra-nationalist and pro-racial segregation, and while they are notionally ""anti capitalist"", they were/are ""anti-big-capital"" and ""anti-capital-owned-by-brown-people"" rather than against all forms of capitalist economy. Some refer to Third Position as a precursor for Apartheid, for example, as it is probably the closest an actual government has gotten to Third Position politics.

In the UK, Third Position split out of National Front to form ""Official National Front"" (and later went through a number of renamings) at some point in the 80's I believe.

&gt; He describes the means as ""centrally planned state economy"", which Hitler's National Socialist party clearly did not institute.

The idea that socialism requires a planned economy is an idea one often finds drawn out of a lack of knowledge of socialist ideologies - not even authoritarian socialist ideologies like Leninism/Stalinism are intrinsically tied to a planned economy, and many libertarian socialist ideologies are specifically either opposed to it, or contradicts it in principle (as many libertarian socialist ideologies takes Marx' discussion of the ""withering away of the state"", ironically made most famous by Lenin's discussion in State and Revolution, seriously, and sees the dismantling of central power as a vital). 

A centrally planned state economy was something the Bolsheviks didn't intend either. It became doctrine as a result of the wartime economy put in place because of the European powers supporting the White's in the civil war. 

Specifically, the original policy of central planning was called ""War Communism"" and was the official Bolshevik policy until 1921 and was a pure ""survival mode"" to keep things running during the civil war. In 1921 it was replaced by ""New Economic Policy"" which remained in force until Stalin replaced it with increased collectivisation in 1928. New Economic Policy actually *loosened up* on the government control of the economy (Lenin described it as ""state capitalism""), and Lenin intended it to last for decades to help develop and prepare the economy. The full step back to central planning was supported mainly by Stalinists and Trotskyists.

Many other socialist ideologies explicitly favour the use of markets for resource allocation. But in the SSSR, non-authoritarian socialist ideologies were either already outlawed, or about to get you executed, towards the end of NEP.

&gt; All that said, I certainly wouldn't consider the NSDAP to be ""right-wing"", since that represents laissez-faire economic freedom. They are the perfect example of an authoritarian centrist party.

That requires employing a rather novel left-right wing axis. Liberal and libertarian ideologies started out to the left of conservative groupings by the original left/right grouping: The left were originally those that supported republicanism in the French parliament, while the right where monarchists. In fact, in several European countries you find this even reflected in party names. In Norway, for example, the liberal party is name ""Venstre"" (literally ""Left"") and the conservatives are names ""Høyre"" (""Right""). *Some* laissez-faire parties get placed on the outer right - generally certain forms of right wing populist parties where the main draw of laissez-faire is tax-cuts.

Laissez-faire first came to start being associated more with the right after 1848 when the capitalist part of the European left sought out the monarchist right to forge alliances against the working classes, which is how we came to get the right-wing libertarian construction of being for the reduction of government interference *except* in the enforcement of property rights. That Laissez-faire is seen as a ""right wing"" thing is a modern phenomenon, because ""our"" modern right consists of a merger of the original monarchist right and parts of the centre-left, while libertarian socialist ideologies were marginalised from the early 1900's until after the fall of the Soviet Union.

Hitler *did* on occasion talk about taking parts from socialism, but then again he was in good German right-wing tradition in doing so: The worlds first ""proper"" welfare system was introduced by Chancellor Bismarck. He was ""accused"" of being a socialist by other parts of the right over it, but made the argument that it was a necessary means to undermine the socialist parties, by giving just enough to pacify the working classes, and then he adopted the ""slur"" his opponents had used against his policies by explicitly referring to his policy as ""state socialism"".

Ignoring all your social anxiety issues, what I believe you need is a job which involves working on your own, is not complicated, is cheap to get into, and doesn't require any qualifications. Find something to do with your hands and stick with it.

My suggestion would be something like gardening. First of all, get yourself an edging knife, a dutch hoe, a brush and a wheelbarrow. Then tidy up the edges of your own front lawn, and offer to do your neighbour's for free. Then, go door-to-door selling your services. It's not a skilled job, the tools are cheap, and you won't have to talk to people except a well-rehearsed ""Hi, I'm Notafunctioningadult. I've been tidying up the edges of people's front lawns in the area, and was wondering if you'd be interested?"" If they say no, you leave your telephone number and a quote (roughly £10-£12 an hour to start with, but just take a guess and give them a cash quote, not an hourly rate), along with details of other houses in the area which you have done.

Chances are, half of them will see their neighbour's lawn looking fantastic, and give you a ring. This quickly turns into a race to not be the last one on the street with a shitty front garden.

The fresh air will do you good, it's honestly a fun and relaxing job, and it's easy to expand later into other gardening areas.

Well, yes, they effectively would. They would be stuck/imprisoned in a house and therefore forever in debt, if the value remained lower than the mortgage. (This is already the case for large numbers of people who bought before 2009.) 

Unable to leave without taking a massive financial hit. For who? People who haven't bothered to save for a house? Or just those who can't afford one but are trying to save? Fair play to them, but they're no more deserving than anyone else is.

Really...

All homeowners? What about the ones who bought their house 30 years ago? What about those who bought this year, when prices were vastly below that seen in 2007? They're all to blame are they?

No.  It's that the distances involved in the commute are now for the majority of people beyond what public transport (or indeed cycling) can accomplish in a reasonable amount of time. 

To get from where I live, to Staines (where my other half works) by car takes about 1hr 40min.  The fastest the train can do it is 2hr 11min and the slowest is 2hr 50min.  On a push bike, according to Google maps, you are looking at 4hr 41min. 

Driving is the only way to accomplish the daily commute and not spend the majority of the day travelling too/from your place of work for a lot of people. 

If you want to see less cars you need to figure out how to reduce those public transport figures to the same as (or preferable less than) the car for no more money fiscal outlay than the car costs per year.

&gt;You may be thinking of Third Position, which was an extreme right, ultra nationalist set of related ideologies that could be seen as proto-fascist/nazist.

Apologies, I have no formal economic education so the jargon is a little hard for me to grasp at times. This proto-fascism of racist capitalism sounds very familiar to me when I read accounts of National Socialist economic practices. 

&gt;The idea that socialism requires a planned economy is an idea one often finds drawn out of a lack of knowledge of socialist ideologies 

I don't necessarily disagree, but your position here diverges rapidly with the position stated by Hayek in TRTS. As I'm sure it's clear, my thoughts on what socialism ""is"" are not in agreement with Hayek's.

&gt;That requires employing a rather novel left-right wing axis.

I would smugly argue that the left-right axis is a poor comparison of different views of political though, in an effort to avoid having to defend something I know relatively little about.

&gt;Laissez-faire first came to start being associated more with the right after 1848 when the capitalist part of the European left sought out the monarchist right to forge alliances against the working classes, which is how we came to get the right-wing libertarian construction of being for the reduction of government interference except in the enforcement of property rights.

I see, but is this appropriate when one is attempting to consider the modern, post-1848 right wing where laissez-faire is usually the rule and not the exception? 

&gt; He was ""accused"" of being a socialist by other parts of the right over it, but made the argument that it was a necessary means to undermine the socialist parties, by giving just enough to pacify the working classes, and then he adopted the ""slur"" his opponents had used against his policies by explicitly referring to his policy as ""state socialism"".

Doesn't that return to my original objection, that Hitler cannot be accurately described as a socialist?

true,Hobgoblinpie,eng-eastsusex,East Sussex,"What annoys me more is when people claim that 'diets do not work', rather than looking at the actual reasons why people put on weight after dieting. It's a lack of willpower.

All people have to do to lose weight is eat less. It's not difficult to eat what you want and still lose weight, but the amount of people I know who jump onto the latest fad diet, like the 'juice diet', lose some weight and then immediately rebound back is ridiculous. You don't need to sacrifice all the food you enjoy to lose weight, and it shouldn't feel like punishment, but I suppose years of stuffing their faces full of cake, pies and sugar means they know more about this subject than I do.

Physics dictates that you cannot gain weight if you take in less energy than you require. This is a very basic 'formula' that a lot of people seem to think is bullshit.

And all this is disregarding the fact that obese people are known to over-report the amount of exercise they do, and under report the amount of calories they take in ('I only eat 1000 calories a day but I keep gaining weight'). It's generally good advice to disregard what someone says about their own body when it comes to calorie intake:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1454084

true,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt; Of course Hitler was a kind of socialist, he was leader of the National Socialists after all.

That's a ludicrous argument. By this line of reasoning, North Korea is a democratic state. After all its name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The name in itself is just a label.

&gt; Socialism isn't a monolith, it incorporates a vast array of often contradictory ideologies. 

Here we agree. Case in point: In the Communist Manifesto, Marx and Engels devoted a whole chapter to bitching about forms of socialism the did not agree with, ranging from utopian socialists (Fourier, Owens etc.), to ""reactionary socialists"" that argued for the use of socialist policies, often either out of morality and/or as a means of pacifying the working classes, while propping out feudal power structures (Bismarck and his social welfare program could possible be argued to fit into this category). 

&gt; Nazi style groups often tend to have collectivist policies -- after all they do advocate total state control.

There's nothing about collectivism that makes an ideology more or less socialist. Many socialist ideologies are explicitly individualist. 

More relevant to evaluating nazism this way, nazism explicitly put the protection of private property rights high on their agenda. 

If Hitler was in any way ""socialist"", it was in the way a feudal lord was ""socialist"": He subordinated society and its members to the state. When you belong to the state, rather than the opposite, the state has a vested economic interest in providing a certain level of care for you: You're an asset; if you die or stay sick you can't meet your duties to the state. If you use the word ""socialism"" the way Marx used it, it may not then be unreasonable to describe this as ""reactionary socialism"". But Marx' point with this classification was to tear them a new asshole by pointing out that despite the superficial similarities, these ideologies were actually actively damaging to the economic and political interests of the working class. 

Of course pretty much nobody uses ""socialism"" that way today anyway - the meaning started shifting already in the 1840's and 1850's. The NSDAP were explicitly trying to capitalise on the word to draw in working class voters, while at the same time appeasing other parts of society with Hitlers insistence that ""their socialism"" had nothing to do with Marxist socialism.

true,hotcod,null,null,"Knowing and understanding something =/= agreeing with it. Unless you're trying to tell me that you're against face covering while having no concept that they exist? Point being unless you live under rock seeing a Burka in a bank isn't going to come as a existential shock no matter if you personally feel the concept of them is shocking.

&gt;The real problem, of course, is that of validation. How can I be sure that veil wearer is a woman, is following her religion? And not some bratty teenagers, or a man, or a criminal?

None of which are problems for you until it's perfectly obvious they are not who you'd expect. A bunch of men tried robbing a jewelry (?) shop while wearing Burkas... they were easily run down because running away from a crime is a bit harder to do with a sheet over your head. 

Honestly your paranoia is almost palpable and I'd suggest you'll have a much less stressful life when you realise that if someone wants to do something bad to you without you seeing their face or being aware of it coming there's endlessly better ways to it than them wearing a Burka and most of them you'd never see coming... so best to just relax a bit.

Hell most of them won't give a fuck even if you can see them. For example I'm personally missing a front tooth after some guy made a grab for my phone on my walk home one night. I have no real idea what the fucker looked like but not because he was covering his face but because he blindsided me with a punch to mine.

&gt;Of course when you hide your face you prevent anybody from verifying the validity of your actions.

From which I can also presume you also want to ban people from putting their hoods up in public places since ""trouble makers"" often do so with express intent of making it hard to identify their faces?

&gt; if veil wearers wore registration plates (like cars) that permitted the public to identify lawbreakers, the anti-social, litterers.

Why not just make everyone have one? Eyewitness identification is notoriously unreliable after all ""yes officer the snotty toe rag had a shaved head, was so high wearing a grey hooded top!"" ""So like that lad over there?"" ""yes"" ""or that one"" ""maybe"" ""or how about that one?"" ""Well yes"" ""So is it one them?"" ""I don't know isn't that *you're* job? what's all this CCTV for anyway!"" 

&gt;We must have the ability to identify people. For centuries that was by the face. If the face is no longer an option then registration plates are essential.

You have never been able to personally identify most people on the street, in fact you only need to look at the current moral panic about the invasion of privacy that wearing tech like Google Glass is causing with regards to providing possibility of facial recognition to see just how not true that is historically. 

(As an aside if these systems ever become common place I'd not be surprised by a new fashion trend for partial/full face coverings to spring up in reaction.)

There are times and places that people need to be identifiable and most of them are not you being able to identify some one on the street and flat out banning the clothing of a religious and cultural minority is a massive over reaction to the few, if any times, that it would ever make a difference in your life.

No its not. If your family says they will disown you if you don't wear it, its not your choice. If you are brought up as a child to believe you have to wear it, then your parents start to dress you in it when you turn 13 it is not your choice. If your teachers and religious leaders tell you that if you don't wear it you are doing something wrong, and everyone in your community will be disappointed in you, it is not your choice. 

The point of making it a law is to take the power of oppression away from the people who might try to abuse it, and give power to the people who might be oppressed. 

Its why for example we have equality laws, which mean that a man cannot be promoted over a woman in an organisation just because she is a woman. Again you might call that an oppressive law by the government, and that organisations should be free to do as they wish, but it protects women from being treated unfairly, if things are left up to business to decide for themselves, men will on average get promoted over women, because of how the system is.

true,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt; I don't necessarily disagree, but your position here diverges rapidly with the position stated by Hayek in TRTS.

I'm not surprised. 

For a consideration of how silly the idea of socialism as requiring state control, consider that during the period of the First International (the International Working Men's Association), exactly the issue of the role of the state was the foundation for a major power struggle in the organisation, between Bakunin and Marx. The main difference between Bakunin and Marx was that Bakunin saw the destruction of the state as an immediate goal, while Marx saw the state as a temporary tool for restructuring society, until it would ""wither away"". Bakunin explicitly rejected state power as too dangerous, and this is now one of the defining characteristics of anarchism - both socialist and non-socialist forms. But Bakunin was clear that he was a socialist _and_ anarchist. Thus even before considering that major tendencies within Marxism either explicitly rejects central planning, or is open to decentralised or market methods, one of the two major factions in the first international socialist organisation explicitly wanted to make centralised planning impossible by removing any central authority.

If one assumes that Hayek is talking about ""Soviet socialism"", his argument may be reasonable, but then it also applies only to a small subset of socialist ideologies, and even within ""Soviet socialism"" it only really applies with Stalin onwards.

&gt; I would smugly argue that the left-right axis is a poor comparison of different views of political though, in an effort to avoid having to defend something I know relatively little about.

That we can agree with. The left-right axis works best if you simply treat it as an indication of the historical development of ideologies. Without that, it gets messy very quickly.

&gt; I see, but is this appropriate when one is attempting to consider the modern, post-1848 right wing where laissez-faire is usually the rule and not the exception?

Pretty much none of the dominant right wing parties in Europe are strongly laissez-faire, so I think so. ""Social conservatives"" in particular tend to not stomach laissez-faire very well, since it would involve stripping away most laws founded in moralistic concerns where they interfere with business. 

&gt; Doesn't that return to my original objection, that Hitler cannot be accurately described as a socialist? These words are really just labels, not religious dogma, so surely they only hold value based on how accurately they describe ideas.

That part we agree on. I just disagreed with details about why, and had a strong urge to procrastinate ;)

true,houseaddict,null,null,"&gt; Well, yes, they effectively would. They would be stuck/imprisoned in a house and therefore forever in debt, if the value remained lower than the mortgage. (This is already the case for large numbers of people who bought before 2009.) 

Yeah, debt they voluntarily took on in order to own a home I don't see why the people who didn't jump on the housing property bubble bandwagon should be bailing out those that did and OVERPAID for it.

You talk about getting yours and selfishness but in reality it the people who took on those huge mortgages 6 times their salary only have themselves to blame.

If you bought it as an investment, well then investments can go up as well as down. If not, well you still have a house to live in, just keep paying it until you own it. you agreed the price and you knew the interest rates could change.

So yeah, I don't have any sympathy for either of these scenarios and frankly I can't wait for interest rates to go up and for the bubble to burst. I am sitting ready with a fist full of cash but I won't buy into a market like this.

&gt;Really...

&gt; All homeowners? What about the ones who bought their house 30 years ago? What about those who bought this year, when prices were vastly below that seen in 2007? They're all to blame are they?
&gt; 
&gt; I think it's very hard for some people to save and buy a house. Believe me, I know. I just bought one. I suppose I'm to blame too. I guess we should all just never aspire to owning a home ever, because.... why again?

The ones who bought their houses 30 years ago are really not at all relevant here unless of course they try to sell, in which case obviously they are going to attempt to get the best price possible. It's the idiots who over extend to get it that drive prices up generally.

I am not having a go at 'all' home buyers just to be clear, but those that are now demanding we protect them form their own bad decisions by propping up a market to benefit them to the detriment others.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Yeah, debt they voluntarily took on in order to own a home I don't see why the people who didn't jump on the housing property bubble bandwagon should be bailing out those that did and OVERPAID for it.

House prices haven't been high since 2008. No one who bought after that overpaid for it. Those who did overpay at the time are suffering now, and yes, you could argue that they bit off more than they could chew. Those buying RIGHT NOW are still paying less than they were 6 years ago. The people who overpaid for it did so for exactly the same reasons you will when the time comes, because you think it's a viable possibility and you'll see it as an investment. People who don't think they should think of plonking 80-150k down on a property as an investment are financial morons. The art is knowing when to get in and get out.

&gt; So yeah, I don't have any sympathy for either of these scenarios and frankly I can't wait for interest rates to go up and for the bubble to burst. I am sitting ready with a fist full of cash but I won't buy into a market like this.

You're delusional if you think the bubble's going to burst just because interest rates go up. House prices haven't recovered from 2008 and they're going to go up for a long time to come. Every party, whichever one gets elected, will continue to make damn sure of that. You think the BoE is going to let interest rates go up too quickly after the worst economic crisis in history? Good luck.

So you better get on board quickly, because the train's leaving the station. 

Yeah, some people will get shafted and lose their house due to interest rates rising, but there are plenty of others who bought after the crash that won't be going anywhere any time soon, and in fact given how low prices were after 2008, more buy-to-let landlords than ever have been stocking up. So, if you're banking on a collapse once interest rates go up, then sorry, but your in a fantasy world and in for some serious disappointment. 

&gt; I am not having a go at 'all' home buyers just to be clear, but those that are now demanding we protect them form their own bad decisions by propping up a market to benefit them to the detriment others.

The same applies to non-homeowners. Haven't saved your deposit? Why should anyone give a shit?

Presumably you're fully paid-up on tax and insurance and the car is MOTd though?

The police generally don't pull over cars at random, they will usually only stop a car for one of three reasons:

* The driving is obviously erratic or something else is visibly dodgy (e.g. 8 people crammed into a Fiesta etc)
* The number plate comes up on the PNC as having ""previous"" (i.e. the car has been stopped by the police in the past, or is known to be owned by people involved in crime)
* The PNC indicates that the car is currently untaxed or doesn't have an MOT or isn't insured.

It's the last of these that will get OP (or anyone else) who drives an uninsured car. Almost all police cars these days have links to the PNC, many of them have automatic number plate readers too so all the cops have to do is drive along the street and let the system alert them if there are any uninsured vehicles anywhere nearby.",0,1403009523,null,0,false,0,ci9r5p5,t3_28c0z8,t1_ci9r5p5,t1_ci9o1fn,null,1434276935,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

The company that I founded has created a number of highly paid jobs for British individuals, and its contribution to the UK GDP is in the tens of millions of pounds. 


In the last few months more and more things are making me change my mind and question the validity of the choice I made. Everything seems to point towards Britain becoming more and more a nation of xenophobes and bigots, and I'm starting to consider taking my company, my jobs and my business to a country that better recognises the positive contribution of immigrants to the economy and the culture. 

Apparently, according to 73% of the people I shouldn't have the same rights as a British citizen just because I was born abroad, although I like to believe that my net contribution to Britain has been higher than that of most Brits.

Also, even if I became a naturalised British citizen, I still wouldn't be considered ""the same"" by over 50% of the population, for not having been born here and not having British ancestry.

true,Perihelion_,null,null,"&gt;I appreciate your frankness on all accounts. To be clear, I am not trying to establish permanent residence or anything in the UK. I really do intend to just network and explore the country.

Cool beans. As others have said though, it's not us here you'll have to convince, it's the UKBA and they get stricter every year. I can't stress how important it is to make sure everything is slap up to order with finance, story, itinerary, definitely having somewhere to stay pre-arranged etc in case they decide to question you as it could mean serious consequences if they choose to refuse you entry, including being banned from the country for 10 years and sent directly home at your own expense. It's better safe than sorry!

&gt;also, I suppose I apologize for the licensing question and will likely just get mine renewed here before I leave. The more important question was how important driving is in most of the UK. E.g. are most people used to being able to use public or private transit and walking?

In most urban areas of the UK I would say driving is far from a necessity especially as a visitor. Nottingham in general has a very good public transport network that you can use to get around very easily and walking around the city centre itself is perfectly fine (I don't drive and I live and work here with no problem), but Kirkby itself is a pretty small isolated town well outside of the actual city itself, it takes a good 45-50 minutes (assuming the traffic is good) driving to get there from Nottingham city centre and the bus links take even longer and are fairly costly. The train is quicker but much more expensive. If you plan on staying in and around Kirkby/Mansfield rather than Nottingham itself then the ability to borrow a car would be massively helpful if you plan on getting out and about and seeing Nottinghamshire and stuff nearby / not going stir crazy. It's pretty quiet (aside from the odd burglary or fight outside the Nags Head, it's still a rough arse place) around Kirkby itself with very little to do for a visitor- any sort of night life or daytime activities are extremely limited and you'd be quickly bored of sitting around or having to snooze on the bus for an hour or so to reach civilization. Shopping in Kirkby to meet day to day needs is fine as it has all the usual array of shops that you find in a small town in the UK to feed yourself and so on, and a short drive or bus ride will get you to our equivalent of a WalMart. But if you actually want to do something other than sit around playing with yourself, Kirkby's a bit rubbish.

&gt;The working online part is interesting and a bit of new information for me. I will have to look into that more because I certainly don't think I could pool all the money I'd need to live work-free before then. **Perhaps there is some subtle definition of work I will look into.**

Unfortunately not - the only way you'd legally be allowed to work at all is to be sent on a short term thing by your employer in which they would deal with all the paperwork needed to get you in and cover what you're doing. This is pretty much an option limited to people who work for large multinationals with a heavy presence in both countries and very valid reasons for needing to send their own people in to do a job, rather than using UK or EU based workers. If you're say self-employed or run your own small business in Hawaii then that won't happen and if you've not got the built up cash to pay your way while you're here you're going to struggle a bit I'm afraid. Nottingham is a pretty cheap place to visit but renting a bedsit / all inclusive flat for a few months, food, travel fees etc will still rapidly mount up and everything is still more expensive than most places in the US.

&gt;I don't intend to bring weapons or drugs into the company or to partake in illicit activities

Oh, that's no bloody fun! :)

Of course educated/professional types would be welcome, but just as welcome as anyone else who's doing it all above board. The UKBA doesn't care if you've got a degree and are well read, keep tropical fish and enjoy the smell of a second hand paperback novel, they're looking purely at whether you're doing everything properly and intend to continue to do so.

And please don't get me wrong on my frankness,  it's not a case of ""you're not welcome!"" or trying to put you off in any way - it's just that it would be a real pain in the arse for you to fly all the way from the middle of the Pacific to sunny, sunny England and end up having to fly all the way back for naught.

Going through Totterdown once, a passenger in a suit and trainers got verbally aggressive with the driver and tried punching him through the perspex screen when the driver pulled over and told him to get off.

The bus was over capacity, in fact the man had barged his way on earlier after originally being told the bus was full. The driver had relented in an attempt to avoid a confrontation, but the man decided to berate the driver rather than being thankful.

Nobody at the front felt like ejecting him by force. Men squared their shoulders but took a step back, mothers tried distracting their entranced children, but the very Bristolian women at the back started yelling at him to ""get off the fucking bus"", which had most of us nodding in agreement, although I managed to feel some disquiet over them swearing in front of the children.

Then the united front split as a couple of Asian women started crying and pleading with them to stop shouting at him. I'm not sure why they were so scared, as the retreat from the front had packed the aisle with a thick human shield that they were safely behind.

In the meantime the besuited thug had turned around and tried to spot his hecklers, who were by now arguing with the Asian women. Perhaps realizing he would have to punch his way through thirty people, with what I hope was now a saw fist, he left the bus and stood on the pavement swearing profusely at the driver as he closed the doors.

The bus pulled away, there was an audible cheer, and as my row passed him, the girl next to me lent over and flicked a V sign.

&gt;Dear Editor,

&gt;I would like to congratulate the coalition government for bringing a whiff of privatisation into the beleaguered National Health Service. The fact that successive governments have undertaken what they call ‘substantial’ changes to the NHS should tell us all we need to know: there is something fundamentally wrong with how we treat the ill in our country.

&gt;The NHS is the second biggest employer in the world, beaten only by Walmart, but as with all state monopolies, it is costly, inefficient and stuffed with bureaucrats. In New Labour’s NHS, for every nurse there is a manager and vital workers, such as midwives, are falling in numbers.

&gt;The problem, however, goes far deeper. I would argue that the very existence of the NHS stifles competition, and as competition drives quality and choice, innovation and improvements are restricted.

&gt;Therefore, I believe, as long as the NHS is the ‘sacred cow’ of British politics, the longer the British people will suffer with a second rate health service.

You admit you know nothing about market research, then claim the Muslims interviewed were cherry picked.  Again, more speculation based on no actual evidence.  Show me how you know they were cherry picked.

Market research is based on random sampling, and I see no reason why Gallup would have chosen to throw this established principle out of the window purely in an effort to make Muslims look bad.  

You also utterly ignore the 400 leading Muslims and imams that prepared an open letter to the telegraph condemning homosexuality.

Of course there are more liberal Muslims.  And you happen to know three of them.  But that does not mean you can simply ignore market research that demonstrates a pervasive attitude in a particular demographic that runs utterly counter to modern society and attitudes.

It's not so much about what you eat, but how much you eat. Again, this type of addiction can be improved by weaning yourself off slowly. As you take a few snacks out per week, you'll slowly stop gaining weight, and then as you become more proactive about portion sizes, you'll gradually lose weight.

It depends if you'll be using an S&amp;S ISA, how you'll be investing, how much money, etc.

It sounds like you need to do a decent amount of reading before moving a penny. Smarter Investing by Tim Hale is a good book. I also like monevator.com (discusses both active and passive investing).

I'm not giving you financial advice here, but one option is to stick the money in a Vanguard Lifestrategy fund. There are funds with 20, 40, 60, 80 or 100% equities (with the rest in bonds). The higher the proportion in bonds, the safer/less volitile it should (in theory) be, but there is always risk and you must understand what you're investing in. As a 5 year horizon is fairly short I'm guessing you'd be looking at the lower end of that scale (to minimise the risk of your investment being worth less than the initial amount when you liquidate it - but this risk will be present anyway if you invest in equities like this - so you may just want to keep the money in savings). You do pay a premium for the LF funds over the indvidual funds they consist of, but for that you don't have to manually rebalance, and dealing fees could be much lower.

Here's a discussion of the LifeStrategy funds: http://monevator.com/vanguard-lifestrategy/

Yes, sometimes insurance isn't enough because the hospitals don't recognize all insurance companies. I think the insurance need to have a legal entity or partner company in Switzerland that gives a guarantee. As the costs for treatments can be very high and the hospitals don't have the capacity to track down insurance companies all over the planet, they're usually quite strict and require an upfront payment, bank guarantees or so.

&gt; I don't think the patient would have to pay if they're uninsured, though.

Without insurance or upfront payment, they won't treat you beyond the point where your life is save. And you will have to pay for that too. Sure, if you don't have any money at all, at some point they will have to let you go and it would be very hard for them to get your money back once you're back in your home country, so you could get away with it.
