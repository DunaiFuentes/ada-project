You have to remember that people sometimes choose to be ignorant in order to validate their side of an argument. 

They have been made aware of the Hillsborough tragedy and basically don't give a fuck because it doesn't concern their team or community, in fact it annoys them because they are asked to stand in silence once a year (if they even go the game) so they choose to take an issue with the disaster it's self, ignoring the fact that 96 families have been lied to for 25 years by the establishment and have had their name dragged through the mud at the same time. If something similar happened at a concert and not at a football ground then things would have been handled with massively different.

I called some twat out on r/sports for making a Hillsborough 'joke', his defence was that the campaigners and the people who want justice and the truth have damaged their cause by 'acting like it is the worst thing to happen to this country for decades'. I could not believe what i read, i told him that the people who campaign done the exact opposite, look at the developments in the case in the last 30 months and you can see that things are finally paying off. People forget or don't know of the injustice that people have suffered. 

You will also find people who don't know the facts about either of the incidents and just know what to say to touch a nerve. I even met a Liverpool 'fan' from Watford at Aintree this year who told me 'all this Hillsborough stuff, don't you think it's time to just forgive and forget' i cannot explain how angry and upset that made me. 

The best thing to do is to make sure you are educated (which OP seems to be) on both disasters and fight any of their ignorance with the truth, as tempting as it is to want to lash out at these people its not the way to handle it.

I originally planned to use a doctor from Pakistan as an example, but realised I could expect a common 'kipper response of ""it's unchecked European migration we're against"".

I'm sure that few of their voters share this limitation, however.

We have 3 kinds of ""immigrants"" to the UK:

* Those from EU nations with whom we're in reciprocal agreements, agreements which allow us to engage in dental tourism to Poland and buy ski lodges in Bulgaria. 
* Skilled workers that we need, such as doctors, nurses and engineers from the 3rd world.
* ""Asylum seekers"", which is a dog-whistle term meaning ""people seeing refuge because their lives are at risk at home. We're obliged to offer them refuge under international agreements. 

It seems unlikely that UKIPpers, who go on about the ""threat to British culture"" posed by the ""hordes of foreigners"" who are ""flooding the country"", would be happy to end only the immigration of European migrants who are most like us.

Its why C.Ronaldo isn't the captain of Madrid even though he is one of the best performers. A leader's job isn't just performing on the pitch.

Cahill, in my opinion isn't vocal enough. Doesn't even do too many interviews, and when he does you can hear the nervousness in his voice. You compare him to JT and JT is cool as ice. Lampard too. Drogba too. Those are the real leaders. I'd take Ivanovic or Luiz over Cahill as captain.

Cahill is already 28 and will be 29 half way through next season where I expect JT to remain as club captain. Which would mean Cahill (in in contention) would only become captain till he's almost 30.. So calling him a ""future captain"" isn't really worth mentioning.

It's good if you can, and you should always try to respect it, but some things are just not worth respecting. 

I do not respect a lot of UKIP supporters because the reasons they vote UKIP are based on misinformation, distortions of the truth, and Nigel Farage's personal likeability and ability to 'score points'.

The way that grown up internet forums work - unlike the ""imageboards"" frequented by spotty-faced, masturbation-frenzed teenagers - is that replies should be relevant to the parent comment, and that you make a new comment tree if you want to talk about something else.

All I meant to say really was that without a actual bid being accepted by a player's club it's a bit disingenuous to say a player was close to coming to us or they chose someone else over us (they have no choice to make until a bid is accepted).  

I think in general people tend to get a little stuck on transfer rumors that haven't actually gotten very far into the process.  We scout and then enquire through agents about probably dozens if not hundreds of players.  Some of those we'll go a step further with (if the response is positive from the agent) and hash out things in broad terms.  Of those, some will move forward to discussions with the parent club and of those some will possibly get to a formal bid being made and official conversations with the player can commence if it's accepted.  It's a long, drawn out process and I think because of that people make more assumptions than they probably should (e.g. we enquired so he must be coming).  

We apparently enquired fairly recently about Bertrand, as an example.  This doesn't mean we'll necessarily buy him, but it is an indication of interest, versus say Shaw where we've made no enquiry I've heard of anywhere so it would seem rather less likely to happen regardless of what people may want (although apparently United are seriously looking at him whereas Chelsea was put off by the asking price quoted and are onto other targets).",0,1398402010,null,0,false,0,ch1i4c0,t3_23wfs5,t1_ch1i4c0,t1_ch1ci77,null,1433511701,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

&gt;Steven actually took time out to help one of our young players Adam Forshaw earlier this season. Adam, who was voted League One player of the year, used to be at Everton's academy but is a big Liverpool fan. 
Yet he had got a bit down over an injury and I contacted Steven to give him a lift. Without a second thought, Steven invited us up to the Tottenham game last month and Adam and I watched the game from his private box. Steven came in afterwards with his shirt from the game and gave it to Adam. It made his season.
When Steven sent me the message on Friday, he didn't forget Adam either, saying to wish him all the best for next season. It was a really nice touch.

All games were available to Bainshie and **to my knowledge** he casted everything he could, thanks to Arya, without Arya he would of unfortunately probably missed the chance to cast any matches, as he hadn't been in contact with any other admin in relation to casting (and Arya was a last minute addition to the admin team).

&gt;We know the first day was difficult for all as the Dota 2 client is very buggy at the moment with tournament admin rights and the ticket is still yet to be added to the store, but everyone tried their best in persevering through, in particular Arya in getting Bainshie in the games.

true,Andures,null,null,"Did Liverpool bid for Costa? There was interest, and probably an enquiry, but no actual bid. 

&gt;by no means anything remarkable and not much fuss about him.

You must not have been in Spain. Last season Costa was being talked about by fans much more than Falcao, because EVERYONE hated him. 

&gt;Try buy him for 20m now and see how that goes.

I don't know what your point is. That he improved? Sure. It always comes along with the fact that the team as a whole improved, and Costa is getting so much attention because he is the current top scorer in Atletico Madrid. Falcao was the top scorer last season, so he got the plaudits instead. Last summer, no one would have said that Costa is a better player than Falcao (and I doubt anyone would even now). It only makes sense to pay attention to the one likely to leave since it was exceptionally clear that Atletico was not going to sell **both** their top scorers in the same window. Also, the big clubs ***DON'T*** need to buy him for 20m when they can just buy him for 40m.

Going by the main gist of your argument, it seems that you are basing your idea of how other clubs were not paying attention to those players on the fact that English media was not reporting about them. I saw speculation in the German papers about Dortmund being interested in Mkhitaryan literally the week that Gotze announced he was going to Bayern. 

It's a little funny how you talk about the priority. How do you know what the other clubs' priority was? Last season, Liverpool did not have European competition, and so they hoped to get the drop on other clubs by making very early attempts. Other clubs that were stronger financially and in Europe could simply sit and wait to see the selling club's response. Just because Liverpool bids first doesn't mean other clubs did not know of the player or were not interested in them. 

Also, shouldn't Siquiera be a blackmark against the scouts since Liverpool ended up signing Cissokho on loan? 

Due to circumstances, Liverpool **had** to look for players who had more potential than fame, unlike the big clubs who could simply buy players who were much more polished and closer to a finished product. All the big clubs have scores of scouts who keep track of hundreds of players in Europe.

Arrest after Bali plane 'hijack' bid in Indonesia
Breaking news

A passenger has been detained in Indonesia after an apparent attempt to hijack a plane that landed at Bali airport, reports say.

The Virgin Boeing 737 plane had flown from Brisbane in Australia.

Police told Indonesian TV that a passenger tried to enter the cockpit and take over the plane but had since been arrested.

An Indonesian air force spokesman told the BBC that troops had boarded the plane.

You're looking for a Circle or Hammersmith &amp; City line underground (yellow or pink) and get off at Paddington. Once there you'll walk to the train station (200m, follow the signs) and board the train to Bath Spa (it will say Bristol Temple Meads as that is the final destination).

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"&gt; Sorry if I've got this wrong or not but, would an example of a light touch be for example subsiding companies such as gas or internet so it's a less of a cost to the people?

No, it's the complete opposite. What you're describing is government interference in the marketplace; economic liberalism shies away from this and believes that in general capitalism works best when business is allowed to manage its own affairs. The extreme form of this belief is economic libertarianism or anarcho-capitalism, which says that no matter what happens, the government must never interfere with business.

Few real-world major political parties subscribe to such an extreme view however, and most would argue that government intervention is sometimes necessary to prevent companies abusing the system via cartels, for example, or to regulate certain industries such as banking (in effect, to say that certain things banks would like to do are actually against the law).

Intervening in a market with government subsidies to make the cost lower for the consumer, as you describe, is very much a socialist / social-democratic concept. There are many in the Lib-Dem Party who would approve of such a policy, but it's certainly not their current way of thinking.

&gt; Would you say or know if this 'sizeable minority' would increase into a majority in the future, to possibly gain popularity, as surely this would favour the majority of the population?

I can't predict what's going to happen to the Lib-Dem's membership over the next few years, I'm afraid! One point worth making is that the Lib-Dems are, as the name suggests, far more democratic than the other major parties. By this I mean that the party's policies are decided by its membership during debates and votes at the annual conference, whereas for Labour and the Conservatives the leadership decide policy, and conference can at best either approve or reject specific ideas.

So this means that if the more left-wing members of the Lib-Dems manage to persuade enough of their colleagues about their point of view, they can change the party's official policy. However even if that were to happen I expect that the party leadership would point out that they're the junior partner in a coalition government and no matter what the Lib-Dem rank and file members might want to happen, Nick Clegg and the other Lib-Dem MPs can't go round single-handedly creating laws.

&gt; If you don't mind me asking, could you care to briefly explain the reason in recent increase of UKIP's popularity

The reasons are varied. Firstly there's the simple Farage factor. Nigel Farage is a very skillful politician. By this I mean he not only knows the right thing to say to appeal to a significant group of people, but he also knows *how* to say it. In short, the man is charismatic, and that's a huge benefit for any ambitious politician.

Secondly, UKIP (the leadership, at least; perhaps less so for individual councillors and candidates) have been very clever in presenting their position in a way that appeals to a very broad spectrum of people. Many of their economic policies are essentially repackaged versions of ideas that the right wing of the Conservative Party have been proposing for decades, and so at a time when the Conservatives are perceived to have moved towards the centre, UKIP can pick up votes from disillusioned Tory voters. However at the same time the anti-EU core rhetoric of UKIP appeals to those who are in low-skilled jobs and/or part-time jobs and who feel their position is under threat because of EU immigration -- these are people who would traditionally have voted for the Labour Party.

Finally UKIP is making good use of the current public distrust and dislike of politicians. Events such as the expenses scandal, along with a perception that many MPs are career politicians (i.e. have gone straight from school to university to politics, with no experience of ""the real world"") means that politicians are held in quite low regard these days. Nigel Farage has presented himself as a man-of-the-people type of character who aims to shake up the world of Westminster and who is not afraid to tell the politicians exactly what he thinks of them. Whether this is true or not is debatable but it certainly appeals to a lot of people when he appears on television saying the same thing that they were thinking.

true,Andures,null,null,"Siqueira signed for Benfica on loan. According to transfermarkt.com, the loan fee was 1 million Euros and the option to buy is 7 million. That's too high? Or did the Liverpool management consider him not worth that price?

Big clubs didn't buy Costa because they wanted Falcao, who was and still is better. The clubs that missed out on Falcao didn't go for Costa because they knew Atletico would not sell. 

Mkhitaryan **was** an unproven gamble. The big clubs did not need to gamble. Only Liverpool and Dortmund did. By the way, he has been pretty inconsistent this season, and his performance has been good, but no world beater. 

By the way, going by your logic, if Liverpool turned out to be the first club to bid for Koke, are you going to put that down to the scouts being ahead of the game again? Because even though the papers have yet to catch up, I can assure you that every single club is looking at Koke right now. Chances are, however, they know that there is a higher chance of Costa moving in the summer, and Atletico won't sell Koke so they'll probably look elsewhere. 

The 2 points are very simple. First, Liverpool being linked in the media to a player first doesn't necessarily mean that the scouts at other clubs don't know the player. Bigger clubs with Europe and more money can afford to bide their time. 

Secondly, your main source of information regarding transfers is likely to come from English media, which tends to have the fans of the English Premier League in mind. Media in other countries also linked clubs with these players, but you didn't see them because you were not from those countries. 

You really need to have a better understanding of how transfers, scouting, and player agents work with media before making a claim that Liverpool scouts are way ahead of their game. ",0,1398415071,null,0,false,0,ch1lb1i,t3_23wfs5,t1_ch1lb1i,t1_ch1kwgk,null,1433513203,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,Norvaldov,lfc68,,"Depends on how you want to look at it, I suppose. I think it would be reasonable to say that the players I'd expect to start more or less any given game with everyone fit is Cech, Ivanovic, Terry, Cahill, Azpilicueta, Matic and Hazard (and probably Oscar). As of now, three of them are out. Actually, come to think of it, we're possibly without three of our starters as well (Enrique, Henderson, Sturridge(?)). 


Kalas is the odd one out in the line up, but apart from wanting to rest Azpilicueta (understandable, if so, but he **is** avaliable), Mourinho could move Ivanovic in and play Azpilicueta on the right. Terry is a great defender and will be missed, but Ivanovic is up there too.


After his re-arrival, Matic looks to be the first choice as one of the two DMs. This leaves room for one more out of Lampard, Ramires, Luiz and Mikel. Ramires has had a bit of an off season, so I'd imagine Luiz would have started there. Both are fit and Matic cant play CL anyway so he's a lock. 


They've changed it up a bit on the wings too, but with Hazard out that's a clear loss. Still, with Schurrle, Willian and Salah (who again is cup tied and will probably feature), they've got good players to come in, albeit not as good as Hazard. Oscar is probably their first choice as the number 10, but he's trailed off some after a great start to the season.


Torres is the striker with the most minutes in the EPL for Chelsea this year. Ba is in decent form at the moment. Let's be honest, they've had a problem with their strikers all season and Eto'o really isnt the decisive first choice. If all else fails, they can field that small horse here.


Who's resting?
 
In defense: Cahill? Azpilicueta? Ivanovic (was suspended vs Atletico, so should probably play)? 

In the centre (competing for **one** spot): Luiz or Lampard or Mikel?

On the wings (competing for one spot): Schurrle (who got 20 minutes tuesday) or Willian? 

In the hole: Oscar (didnt play mid-week, so would be surprised)?


In the end, Mourinho's weaker squad could include what I'd claim to be seven first team starters, and that's with a wild card up front. Or, as I still hold possible, he could just sabotage the hell out of things and field something ridicilous out of spite for the FA or something.

The reality is that some businesses simply cannot take on the risk associated with a full-time salaried staff with a minimum term contract, and all that comes with it.

Less risk to employer but slightly more of a guarantee and huge benefits to the employee. ZHCs are far from ideal for anyone but the reality is that the economy is still extremely fragile and a great many businesses are only just now starting to slowly recover. Forcing many businesses to only offer normal salaried positions is, I think, a terrible idea. Encourage them, yes, perhaps with some form of financial incentive, but don't force them. And actually this is also about the employee too. Maybe some people are perfectly happy with a ZHC? My sister just finished a stint at a company on a ZHC and both she and the employer were more than happy with the arrangement. She was recently promoted to a normal salaried contract.

Land buyup would be a lot cheaper too, and it might even help create economic centres in the North (which the government bangs on about, but does nothing to promote).

The Aberdeen -&gt; Edinburgh line is a joke. It takes 2.5 hours, about the same time as driving.

Another point: Anyone else think the time scale for HS2 is fucking ridiculous? I mean, its what, 400 miles of track? And its not going to open until 2033! To put it in perspective, China is building at least 1,000 miles of track per year. Can we not just contract it out to a Chinese company?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;According to traditional sources, Aisha was six or seven years old when she was married to Muhammad and nine when the marriage was consummated.[6][7][8][9][16][18] However, al-á¹¬abarÄ« records that she was ten.[9] Ibn Khallikan, as well as Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi citing Hisham ibn Urwah, record that she was nine years old at marriage, and twelve at consummation.[19] Muhammad Ali, an Ahmadiyya leader, challenged the notion that Aisha was as young as the traditional sources claim; arguing that according to the compiler of the hadith collection Mishkat al-Masabih, Wali-ud-Din Muhammad ibn Abdullah Al-Khatib, Aisha would be nineteen years old around the time of her marriage.[20]

Cursory research provided the exact opposite, that traditional sources hold it the age of 9 or 10 and one fringe source holds it at 19(ie. not a traditional islamic text). 

The article then goes on to say the issue is of contention so you probably can't say one way or the other -  100 percent.

Yet your comment is misleading because you assert it's untrue when only one fringe source is claiming Aisha was 19 and the rest argue 9 or 10. Given the high prestige held on virginity of the time, child-marriages used for political unions and especially in Arabia I'd put my money on 9 or 10. 

I'd be interested if you can provide a verifiable source proving the above wrong - otherwise consider yourself haraam'd

Has this actually been stated by the party somewhere?

There's nothing wrong with that, it should be said - if the only thing NI21 had to offer was a Unionist party free of the baggage of both religious and paramilitary issues, that would still be a welcome addition to NI's political landscape.

This whole discussion seems to echo one of the points in the article - NI21's current representation presents one outlook (unambiguously pro-union, centre-right), while people commenting and supporting the party have quite another (agnostic or economically driven on the union, more left-leaning). A similar disconnect between supporters' and politicians' views caused issues for the Lib Dems when they finally made it into power, I wonder if NI21 has a similiar surprise waiting in the wings.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Nope dude, wikipedia isn't cursory research, it's basic information. Research is when you go beyond that.

And I'm not claiming a fringe source I'm actually referring to the Hadith itself. Saad al Baghdai himself says you should discount  Hisham's sources in Iraq because he was senile. I think Imam Malik comments on it some length can't remember the exact source. Will find it. 

Secondly, both Bukhari and Tirmidhi are a couple of hundred years later than Mohammad's time, on top of that the Tabari is even later than that. Tabari himself is supposed to be very famous as a seera scholar - but he's been criticised by later scholars for having a certain agenda and even some Salafist ( the extremists) discount some of his history. 

The idea that all this is accepted by Islamic scholarship unquestioningly is just a myth generated to make people think Islamic scholarship is uniform.  Earlier scholars weren't that certain about the ages or dates.  The earliest recorded history of islam by Ibh Ishaq is very fuzzy on the ages. Considering Ibn Ishaq Tabari's main source , it's interesting that this obsession with the age crops up later.

There are reasons for this that people have speculated on which I can't be bothered to go into because it won't really mean much to you, as you don't know the subject and won't be interested anyway. I'll just say this - Constantine made Christianity into a very Roman religion. The Abbasid and later Turkic dynasties that appeared later in Islamic history had their influences on Islam too. It's interesting that a lot of ""traditional"" scholarship actually appears in the heyday of these empire. The ""Sahih"" hadith collections are an Abbasid era enterprise

Thirdly, the only records we can actually confirm though multiple sources are when Aysha died , when her sister died, and the difference in ages puts at around 18/19 by simple maths. 

Fourthly, Shia muslim scholarship is almost as old as sunni scholarship and it paints a very different picture of Islamic history . That alternative narrative is very interesting to read.

Can you tell us by how much? Is someone afraid of snipers? This isn't the 70s or 80s.

Surely you would pop over the border because that's what cyclists do? Why would you pop over just to say that you did? Is it some kind of boast now? Going into no-man's land?

It's not a ""conspiracy"" for a shows producers or a channel's editorial to be reluctant to go into, say, Donegal - just narrow minded.

Where's the laughs? You've got some D-list motormouth with a couple of cameras on the bike, making unfunny jokes and using the show as an ego vehicle.

We shouldn't underestimated Schwarzer either, he's experienced as fuck, not some back up kid who is happy sitting on the bench and collecting his weekly pay cheque, he'll come in and give a good showing, I mean the title and the European title is at stake? He's not exactly lacking motivation to perform is he.

I think we'll play the diamond, if Sturridge is fit to start. Chelsea are strong defensively so we'll need the extra threat of two forwards pulling their defence around the pitch. Sterling and Coutinho should both start also with Gerrard and Allen holding and pulling the strings deep. The question is Sakho or Agger, we showed a lack of organisation last week against Norwich, maybe Skrtel realises that and will start to lead a bit more at the back which he should already be doing, that's one thing we definitely miss when Agger isn't playing, he learnt a lot from Carragher and we might need that leadership quality on Sunday.

I'm slightly worried about Suarez and Sturridge, I feel like they've been underperforming by their standards for a couple of games now and hopefully they step it up at the weekend, obviously Suarez got a goal against Norwich last Sunday but in terms of the goalscoring form they were in last month etc. - they are no where near that kind of form. Albeit, they are providing the space and assists, I just thought I'd point out that we need them to be at their best against Chelsea because they will park the bus from the word go, I just think we will tire them out as we pass it about and get at them.

We are still limping out of recession, and for many businesses (though many companies absuse it to fuck also - the care industry being a particular example in my experience) taking people on, on a permanent basis with fixed hours is not an option given the amount of work coming in. 

If it ends up anything like how many 'temporary contracts' go, they'll be left to labour roles that need limited skill sets and designed for a high turn over - in effect, soon as the obligations come close to kicking in, you get fired.

As it stands right now the NHS provides primary healthcare to people regardless of their income.  If the NHS is privatised, people who cannot afford advanced medical care will be deprived of that care.  Case in point - Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy drugs are astronomically expensive; but if you have cancer in the United Kingdom you will get these drugs for free via the NHS.  Privatise the NHS, and you will likely need a private Medical Insurance, which may or may not pay for your chemotherapy regimen.

The government wants to privatise healthcare to reduce government expenditure, as the NHS receives government funding from tax revenue etc.  There is concern, however, that this is not the only reason that it is being done, and that there are various factions within the government who will benefit financially from the sell-off of the NHS.

Personally, I believe that primary or critical-need healthcare should be free - this is why we pay National Insurance after all.  However, I do not believe that elective surgery e.g. breast enhancement, rhinoplasty, tummy tucks, stomach staples etc should be funded via the NHS, except where there is a clinical diagnosis that concludes that they are necessary for the patient's physical and mental wellbeing - translation: I'll gladly pay NI so you can get your cancer meds, but I do not want to pay NI so you can get liposuction, you fat pie-eating fuck.

If you don't find Smiley funny and/or interesting then I guess this programme isn't for you and even if we spent the whole show in Donegal and Cavan it wouldn't make it any more appealing to you.

&gt;It's not a ""conspiracy"" for a shows producers or a channel's editorial to be reluctant to go into, say, Donegal - just narrow minded.

There were a lot of places we didn't go to in the 6 counties either. Ballymena, for example. Portadown for another. Was that also ""narrow minded?"" There was no *reluctance* to go to Donegal (or Ballymena for that matter) but we chose the best locations/stories that we could do justice to within our time frame and budget. Speaking solely as a production researcher (ie; I have no power to actually make this happen) I would be very happy to take the show to both Donegal and Ballymena next time if we found the right stories.

&gt;Surely you would pop over the border because that's what cyclists do? Why would you pop over just to say that you did? Is it some kind of boast now? Going into no-man's land?

Cyclists do a lot of things that we didn't have time to feature in the programme. Also just riding on the roads over the border isn't enough to justify the expense of filming it, we would have needed an item for the programme. I would have liked to include something like the Inishowen 100 (an amazing 100 mile bike race around Donegal) but unfortunately our schedule didn't line up with the event. Again, this is something I would love to include in a future series of the show if/when etc.

&gt;Can you tell us by how much? This isn't the 70s or 80s, is someone afraid of snipers?

 I don't know a *lot* about this but as far as I understand it insuring a production to film in one country (say, the UK) is cheaper than insuring it to film in 2 (the UK and Ireland for example). This isn't my particular area of expertise so I'm not able to tell you more. I do know that it has nothing to do with snipers, however.

&gt;Why would it be so hard to editorially justify including Donegal in a show about cycling in the north of Ireland?

It absolutely isn't, but it is *easier* to justify items in the 6 counties when your production base is Belfast, you are on a tight filming schedule, it costs more money to film in Donegal and all the events that you wanted to film there happened months before you were scheduled to start filming anyway...

It wouldn't be professional of me to go in to any more details about the production of the programme here so that really is all I can tell you. 

I get the feeling that you're going to have a bee in your bonnet about this programme no matter what, so the best advice  I can give you is that life's too short to spend it watching TV shows you don't like and then complaining about them on the internet.",0,1398425659,null,0,false,0,ch1n2pe,t3_23o9zj,t1_ch1n2pe,t1_ch1mkob,null,1433514110,3,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,3

what this means is that if you just got a year's worth of interest paid in one month ago, you today have got another month's worth of interest, somewhere in the bank's system.  hopefully someone here will confirm this, but my understanding is that if you were to close an account at any time in between interest payments, the bank would pay you the accrued interest. you certainly wouldn't lose it for ever, and you wouldn't have to wait until next year to receive it. can someone who knows a bit more about retail banking help?

assuming that's correct, it means you shouldn't worry too much about whether an account pays monthly/annually/other. the interest rate is the most important thing, and the only real advantage of receiving interest more frequently is that you get a bit more visibility on how much you are accruing.",0,1398426045,null,0,false,0,ch1n5lz,t3_23v3d6,t1_ch1n5lz,t3_23v3d6,null,1433514145,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

I doubt it. You can generally transfer the 'current years funds' into a new account and keep the 'previous years funds' where they are (and by years we are talking tax years and not calender years of course). 

In your case, as the Nationwide don't take transfers in, your best bet is to check the date that you S/O hit the Tesco ISA this year, look at the Tesco T/C's and find out if there is a cooling off period (likely if the interest rate or T&amp;C's have changed in any way since last year) and if so, are you still within it. If you are lucky, you might be able to just get a refund of the Â£6 and open a new ISA with Nationwide.

If not, you might be able to persuade Tesco that the last transfer in was a mistake and get them to refund it so that you can open the Nationwide ISA.

If you want an old town will be better off down the road in Shrewsbury (pronounced Shrewsbree), which has a bit more of an old world feel, it has a [castle with a museum](http://www.shrewsburymuseum.org.uk/visit-shrewsbury/shrewsbury-castle/) and [church in close proximity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's_Church,_Shrewsbury) right in the city centre, it is also reachable by train. Near Telford is [Ironbridge and the Ironbridge Gorge museum](http://www.ironbridge.org.uk/), which will certainly provide you with some local (industrial) heritage. If you want to visit a typical old Victorian manor house, [Attingham Park](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/attingham-park/) just outside of Shrewsbury might be good. The nearest large city is Birmingham which is the biggest in the UK after London, again reachable by train, there are plenty of free Art galleries and old buildings dispersed between the shopping centres and busy streets. However you'll want to plan where to go and how to get there before just setting off since it's not as Tourist friendly as some places, you won't just be able to flag a taxi and get taken places, you'll have to find a taxi rank and know where you want to go. As for food I recommend getting a Balti (indian) or going for a pub lunch somewhere that seems more food orientated (not Weatherspoons). The nearby West Midlands prides itself on having the best Indian cuisine in the UK due to a high indian/pakistani population, pub lunches are the same all over the UK more or less but look for somewhere that is more like a pub restaurant than a drinking pub. You'll usually be able to get a good Fish and Chips, Roast lunch, Yorkshire pudding, Steak and ale pie and so on at these places. I hope the weather is nice since rural England is a thousand times nicer when it is. Hope you have a nice time.

The maths - Aysha was actually 18/19 because she was ten years younger than her sister, Asma, who died in 693 C.E


According to Abda-Rahman ibn Abi Zanna: 

&gt;Asma was 10 years older than Aysha

(Siyar Aâlama-nubala, Al-Zahabi, Vol. 2, pg 289, Arabic, Muassasatu-risalah, 1992).

According to Ibn Kathir:

&gt;Asma was older than her sister Aysha by 10 years

(Al-Bidayah wa-nihayah, Ibn Kathir, Vol. 8, pg 371, Dar al-fikr al-`arabi, Al-jizah, 1933).

According to Ibn Kathir:

&gt;Asmaher son killed during that year and died 100 days later. 

(Al-Bidayah wa-nihayah, Ibn Kathir, Vol. 8, p. 372, Dar al-fikr al-`arabi, Al-jizah, 1933); Ibne Asakir vol 69 Page 18; Alsunnan Alkubra Albehaqi Vol.6 Page 204).

According to Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani:

&gt;Asma lived a hundred years and died in 73 A.H (693 CE).

(Taqribu-tehzib, Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani, p. 654, Arabic, Bab fi-nisa, al-harfu-alif).



So let's do the calculation

   Birth of Asma: 693 -100= 593 C.E

  Birth of Aysha , who is 10 years younger than Asma: 593+10= 603 C.E

  The marriage occurred after the Battle of Badr - 624 C.E

  624-603=19

That's the maths. 



Now here's the language Arabic can be very precise when it comes to language ,especially when they denote specific ages. 

&gt;âI was a young girl (jariyah in Arabic)âwhen Surah Al-Qamar was revealed.""

(Sahih Bukhari, kitabuâl-tafsir, Bab QaulihiBal al-sa`atu Maw`iduhum waâl-sa`atu adhaâ wa amarr).

That Surah of the Quran was revealed eight years before exile from Medina so around 614 C.E. If Ayesha was nine in 623 CE or 624 CE, she'd be a newborn infant.

How do we know this - in Arabic Ayesha uses the word ""Jariyah""  which means young girl. A newborn is ""Sibyah"".

That word ""Jariyah"" is important because it clearly defines a stage in girls life. Now bear that in mind when I quote one the most prominent scholars in Islamic history - source for a lot of the Salafism you see in Saudi:

Ahmad ibn Hanbal says that when Khadija , his first wife died in 619CE , the clan came to him and asked : 

&gt;âYou can marry a virgin (bikr) or a woman who has already been married (thayyib)â. They mentioned Aysha as *""bikr""*  or a virgin **not** as ""jariyah"" young girl.    Bikr is used for an unmarried with no sexual experience prior to marriage. 
(Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Vol. 6, pg 210, Arabic Dar Ihya al-turath al-`arabi).

Also, if you feel like the drive, and some nice fish and chips, go to the Black Country Living museum, it's a working town, and freaking awesome. http://www.bclm.co.uk/ is the link, see how you feel.

However, if you plan on going to Birmingham, leave the car at home, and take the train, parking is a pain, and expensive.

There is a closer airport though the prices may be expensive to there, its called Birmingham International, and you can take a train from there, to birmingham new street. Unless you plan on renting from near the airport, that's all up to you.

That's just not fair. The scottish government puts millions of pounds into things like Gaelic teaching, which is great, and I'm proud that those who wish to use it have the freedom to. However it's just one facet of the nation's culture; the rest largely ignored. This particular legislation pours it all into one pigeon hole, holding the celtic aspect in higher regard than the rest.

I think Liverpool is a city that has such a crap reputation for people in the UK who have never actually been, and it's so undeserved. So many people I come across down South just assume it's like Stoke or Wolverhampton - some crappy run-down industrial city somewhere north of the M25 with no real soul and not much to see (sorry if anyone here lives in either of those places, but I've spent time in both and that's my opinion of them). They assume the whole place is just a collection of run-down council estates that bleed into some sort of city centre. 

Yet its not - the city centre is actually a pretty fantastic place to visit, especially since the refurb for the Capital of Culture stuff in 2008. I've read somewhere that it has more museums and art galleries than any other city in the UK outside of London (most of which are free), plenty of interesting architecture (Pier Head, two pretty impressive cathedrals...), and you can have an absolutely cracking night out there - probably one of the best nights out in the UK in my opinion for any city besides Newcastle. 

I've always really liked Liverpool as a city, though had a sense that maybe it was just local bias. But then I've had a few southern friends visit the city recently, one who lived there for six months, and it made me happy how they came back with glowing reviews and saying how much they loved the city. More people should go visit the city for a long weekend because there's plenty to do and see, even if you don't give a toss about football or The Beatles.

While data limitations mean that we cannot make a direct connection between the growth of zero-hours contract use and rising rates of under-employment since 2008, there may be a link between the two

which seems a little like acknowledging limitations but drawing conclusions anyway. If you compare their estimates of ZHC numbers (most growth since 2010), most of the growth comes after the surge in underemployment according to the ONS (which as 2008-09, and little since then).

&gt;Taking all known accounts and records of Aisha's age at marriage, estimates of her age range from nine to 19.

&gt;Because of this, it is impossible to know with any certainty how old Aisha was. What we do know is what the Qur'an says about marriage: that it is valid only between consenting adults, and that a woman has the right to choose her own spouse. As the living embodiment of Islam, Muhammad's actions reflect the Qur'an's teachings on marriage, even if the actions of some Muslim regimes and individuals do not.

So the answer really, after all this research is anywhere between 9-19 and respectable historians er on the side of 9. So I have my answer really.

Up front I can't imagine Chelsea having much luck. No Hazard and probably no Eto'o who were the main two to link up at Stamford Bridge. Torres could cause problems but I have faith that he'll stick his guns and be woefully ineffective. Ba would probably be the most dangerous option but most likely the main threat will come from the Chelsea midfield. 


Willian/Oscar/Lampard/Salah/Schurrle scare me. Gerrard will have to be disciplined and constantly sit deep to block Willian and Schurrle around the box and whoever sits on the left of the diamond will have to track back against Salah because Flanagan could be exposed with his pace.

Hence, the Popperian/neo-Popperian view is that a counterfactual question is not falsifiable, and therefore not a meaningful question. Unverifiable (cross-world) assumptions are needed to express a joint distribution of variables in separate counterfactual universes. For this reason, causal inference in epidemiology is generally based on average causal effects, on individual causal effects (as you suggest here). From a practical point of view, jumping to thinking about counterfactual contrasts without thinking carefully about interventions is dangerous (as here - changing the rules on admissions would have many complex effects which are difficult to predict).

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; respectable historians er on the side of 9. So I have my answer really. ..

No.. that's not what Myriam says..

&gt; Other Muslims doubt the very idea that Aisha was six at the time of marriage, referring to historians who have questioned the reliability of Aisha's age as given in the saying. In a society without a birth registry and where people did not celebrate birthdays, most people estimated their own age and that of others. Aisha would have been no different. What's more, Aisha had already been engaged to someone else before she married Muhammad, suggesting she had already been mature enough by the standards of her society to consider marriage for a while. It seems difficult to reconcile this with her being six.

This is *particularly* appropriate for you:

&gt;The Islamophobic depiction of Muhammad's marriage to Aisha as motivated by misplaced desire fits within a broader Orientalist depiction of Muhammad as a philanderer. This idea dates back to the crusades. According to the academic Kecia Ali: ""Accusations of lust and sensuality were a regular feature of medieval attacks on the prophet's character and, by extension, on the authenticity of Islam.""



&gt;Since the early Christians heralded Christ as a model of celibate virtue, Muhammad â who had married several times â was deemed to be driven by sinful lust.

&gt;Those who manipulate her story to justify the abuse of young girls, and those who manipulate it in order to depict Islam as a religion that legitimises such abuse have more in common than they think. Both demonstrate a disregard for what we know about the times in which Muhammad lived, and for the affirmation of female autonomy which her story illustrates.

One of the things that does piss me off about how the NHS is treated by politicians regarding it's cost.

When it was set up, we were utterly bankrupt from the war. We had a massive surge of a disabled and injured population to deal with and this was done at a time where the economy had no indication of improvement and at a time when it was changing back from a wartime footing when we had massive debts and were losing what remained of our Empire.

We could afford it then (at the same time as we were building millions of new homes). And that cost also included setting up the basic infrastructure which is now established.

But now? Despite Britain being in the top ten economies in the world, even with the problems, suddenly it's not affordable.

At a time when millions (if not billions) is being earmarked for a project that will save 20 minutes on a train journey and we are considering replacing our nuclear ""deterrent"" (doesn't seem to have deterred Argentina), suddenly saving lives and improving the life quality of hundreds of thousands isn't important enough a reason to pay for it.

If we are running out of money, the last thing that should have it's budget cut is the NHS. The BBC is far less important than health, as is political funding, subsidising energy companies, fucking railway lines and all the other things considerably less important than health.

In 1946, politicians weren't paid anything. If the government wants to save millions, stop taking our fucking money for yourselves. That's going to save a lot more than trying to force my severely disabled son
(that became disabled fighting in a war that only benefited oil companies) into a job that isn't even there for able bodies people.

The NHS has saved the lives of millions. What can be more important than that?

&gt;

&gt;__Tachycardia__ is a [heart rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate) that exceeds the normal range. In general, a resting heart rate over 100 beats per minute is accepted as tachycardia. Tachycardia can be caused by various factors that often are benign. However, tachycardia can be dangerous, depending on the speed and type of rhythm. Note that, if it is pathological, a tachycardia is more correctly defined as a [tachyarrhythmia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyarrhythmia).

It's called fronting and is classed as fraud. If your girlfriend is willing to change the name on the V5 document to yours then you can put the insurance in your name and accrue No claims discount.

I will second the suggestion of putting an experienced older driver down as a named driver. I put my dad down, he's 60, and has bee driving since he was 17 he's been a named driver on my policies since i passed my test in '08 it's only now that i'm getting to full no claims that it's not making much difference in price. I think he's only driven my car 3 time max, but at first it halved my premium. It's the driving experience that knocks the premium down. 

Insurance is based on risk, and as someone with no, no claims you pose a higher risk, if you have a named driver that poses little risk (eg. parent with no claims &amp; more driving experience) then the insurance company sees it as you having less time on the road, as the named driver will be using the car also, so therefore there is less likely going to be an accident/claim.

As for accruing no claims, some insurance companies will accept being named on a policy as proof but most won't. I'm afraid you're stuck between a rock and a hard place really.

So if LvG had odds of 4/1 and FdB had odds of 50/1 then the bookies are saying it is much more likely that LvG would be named the manager.

People are saying that because the FdB odds have been cut down that there may be information implying that he is signing with Spurs (or multiple large bets have come in for FdB or a high number of bets overall have come in for FdB so the bookies are slashing odds to ensure they are protected)

Thing is, the bookies tend to move the odds up and down to ensure that they can make the most money and guard against potential losses...this can happen for any number of reasons so you can't use betting odds as an indicator of something happening.

I didn't ask for your government to steal from every man, woman and child to pay for those roads and then claim ownership. Could roads not be built without a government? How ridiculous is that? Saying I should be stolen from because there are already public services and I would be stealing from you. No, I'm not stealing from you. Your government actually is though.

Yep. I didn't ask for that. I would rather pay my own private security and fire service. At least then I know I'm not paying for my police force to go rough up someone just because they're smoking a spliff or some other archaic reason. You know, they would actually be helping because otherwise I wouldn't pay them. Oh yes, I could not pay them if they did something I didn't like. Unlike now where you grin and bear it.

""The general idea they have is that the country is simply too overpopulated. "". Academia has shown that  immigration is of benefit financially to a country, and many hold the opinion it a cultural positive too. (source: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24813467 ). What evidence do we have for it being overpopulated?



""My single room studio flat is currently on the market by my landlord for Â£230k."" I don't know if anyone is blaming this on immigration. Instead a lack of social house building is commonly cited as a main cause. 



""Of course Billy and co. down the street might be huge racists, but I'm sure that doesn't neccessarily reflect on the entire party"". Although true that it's not fair to judge people based on the company they keep, UKIP is primarily a single issue party and that issue is based on cultural xenophobia, rather than economic benefit (as we've seen above, immigration is a good thing).



"" There are places where there is a significant lack of british culture due to forgien influences."" This is an opinion. Many people believe that british culture includes the foreign influences. We didn't just appear in the UK, we were all immigrants once and our national identity is based on culmination of many foreign influences. It's a continual process, not a static template. 



Lastly...
"" in my local schools, 40% of kids are white british. It's perfectly OK to worry about this"". It's not perfectly OK to worry about this, this is racism.

Please look at recent example:
http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/bnp-food-banks-are-for-indigenous-brits-only-says-nick-griffin-9226911.html

&gt;ridiculous prices of housing

The house price situation in/around London isn't caused by immigrants. It's caused by all the people, British and foreign alike having to work in concentrated areas. This problem would hardly be dented even if you cut all immigration.

&gt;40% of kids are white british

You seem to be set on making a distinction between *white* British and everyone else. Do you think non-white British don't deserve to be treated the same as white British or are less deserving of being a citizen by virtue of not being white? That is by definition, racist.

&gt;Enjoying your national culture isn't racist

When talking about culture, numerical supremacy is not required to maintain a culture. There is absolutely no chance of your culture disappearing into the annals of time. Will it change though? Yes it will, as all things do over time, just as it has for the last thousands of years through the various religions, wars, invasions, etc etc. Things can never stay the same, it is the natural way of things.

&gt;there are more afro-carribean food places than chip shops and cafes on the main shopping street near me now, which is the kind of thing people worry about

The world is becoming ever more globalised. People of all races and countries and cultures are mixing. You will see more and more foreign customs and foods appearing around you in greater frequency. But that's not because they are *replacing* the customs and foods you enjoy, they're *adding* to it. The fish and chip shops are still there, but now there are more shops overall, and they cater to everyone, not just fish and chip lovers.

And why is this a bad thing? Isn't it great that at pretty much any time, I have access to fish and chips, curry, chinese food, pizza and all the other delights of our wonderful planet, all within a short walk from my home?

&gt;We simply can't afford all this immigration

If you're talking about our economy as a whole? Immigration is the most fantastic thing. It brings so many hard workers to our country, who all pay their tax, who all do their part, just because they just want to live a good life like us. Immigration helps, not harms our economy, and we as a country can definitely afford it.

BUT, immigration does indirectly harm individual people who feel, like you do, that it is unfair that an immigrant is willing to do your job for less, so he gets your job, or forces you to take a lower pay. This is an unfortunate side effect of capitalism and globalisation which disadvantages low skilled workers. That's the angle that BNP and UKIP take to get support.

The only real solution to train our workers to be skilled instead of unskilled and able to compete in the global market.",0,1398437486,null,0,false,0,ch1r02t,t3_23y9hq,t1_ch1r02t,t3_23y9hq,null,1433515957,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6

true,paleogirl,mccoy,McCoy,"For the modern series, my favorite Eccleston moment is the first conversation with the eponymous Dalek in *Dalek*:

""I AM ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE...""

""Yup.""

""... SO ARE YOU.""

And you just see Nine's soul go completely hollow.

For Tennant, it was the *End of Time* conversation with Wilf in the diner. I may despise the way his Doctor was written, but you can't fault him as an actor for his delivery. I sniffled a bit... and I *hated* that two-parter.

For Smith, it's a tie for me between the speech to little Amelia in *The Big Bang*, and the ""Good men don't need rules. Today is not the day to find out why I have so many"" scene in *A Good Man Goes To War*.

However, I'd also like to throw some Big Finish Doctors in here, because there's been some damn fine audio acting in recent years that should get more love.

Peter Davison goes above and beyond the call of duty in several scenes of [*Son of the Dragon*](http://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/son-of-the-dragon-265). At one point, he has been caught in a major battle between two armies in 15th century Romania; forced to defend himself with a sword or be killed. After the battle, he attempts to aid the dying, only to be told that the army can spare no water or supplies for men who are going to die anyway.

Throughout the story, Davison gives off this amazing and increasingly desperate ""Oh, crap, what have I gotten us into, and how the hell am I going to get my companions out of it alive?"" vibe. His focus continues to narrow onto keeping Peri and Erimem from getting killed, in a way which is somewhat reminiscent of *The Caves of Androzani*... but the man has had many more years to hone his acting craft since then. Davison was a good actor in the 80s, but he's an outstanding one, now.

For Colin Baker, I'm quite partial to the climax of [*Arrangements for War*](http://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/arrangements-for-war-223), in which the Sixth Doctor, having just witnessed the pointless deaths of the young couple whom he has been mentoring throughout the story, completely loses his shit and has to be talked down from breaking the First Law of Time by (companion) Evelyn Smythe.

Sylvester McCoy has a stunningly lovely scene with Sophie Aldred's Ace on a hotel balcony in [*The Fearmonger*](http://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/the-fearmonger-623). It's only a quiet moment between two friends, discussing butterflies (the ones who start hurricanes), but it has stuck with me for the fourteen years since the story was first released.

Paul McGann... happily, this sub already sings the praises of McGann as an actor. Big Finish has battered and pounded the poor Eighth Doctor down to his constituent parts before painfully putting him back together on numerous occasions, and McGann delivers, every time. I don't think I could choose a single scene, but some highlights are the ""old man"" speech in [*Chimes of Midnight*](http://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/the-chimes-of-midnight-653), and the transformation into [*Zagreus*](http://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/zagreus-216)-- ""Did you miss me? Did your little human heart ache when I was gone? Did you have bad thoughts about me in the small dark hours before the dawn?"" (Answer: Yes, Paul. Yes, I did. Keep talking like that, please.)

But citizens would be leading really unpleasant lives, because they wouldn't have any of the things that make life enjoyableâthey'd have spent all their money on health care. There are unavoidable tradeoffs to be made in health care systems, and citizens of any country should acknowledge that.

One other thing is that health care is actually much more expensive now than it was in, say, 1960. There are many diseases that were untreatable thenâall you could do was help the patient die less painfully. This is pretty cheap. Now, we're much better at prolonging people's lives, but it's because of technology that can be very expensive.

&gt;In [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology), __haar__ is a [coastal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast) [fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog). Haar is typically formed over the sea and is brought to land by wind [advection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advection).  This commonly occurs when warmer moist air moves over the relatively cooler North Sea causing the moisture in the air to condense, forming haar. Sea breezes and Easterly winds then bring the haar into the East coast of Scotland and North-East England where it can continue for several miles inland. This can be common in Summer when heating of the land creates a sea breeze, bringing haar in from the sea and as a result can significantly reduce temperatures compared to those just a few miles inland.

true,digitalhuxley,null,null,"There's definitely more we could do to teach languages - a native English speaker has the advantage that English contains elements from the romance languages and the teutonic languages, so for us to learn the differences in these would be an obvious educational step in the right direction.  I love your idea of non-language classes taught in other languages, though I imagine it would be end up being seen as un-economic.  I'm not sure why it should stop at Europe though, ideally a good education should prepare you for more than just European culture... or at least inspire the pupils to learn these things themselves.  For instance I remember we were taught nothing in our school about the colonisation of India, which seemed kind of ridiculous given that the majority of people from India will see british people through that lens - not knowing about what it puts a person at a disadvantage.

Schools have probably changed since I left mine, but you ask where language classes are - can one not learn a foreign language when starting a high school in this country?  I remember when I joined high school at 11, I was put into a German class, and also had a French class later, and I would be able to have continued these up to GCSE equivalent and then on to A-level.  In those language classes we had an exchange programme, and in history I remember us studying the history of Europe.  Is this stuff not in place any more since I left school (in the nineties?)

Ultimately, although we should sort educational shortcomings for the good of everybody, it would need a cultural change so that parents saw the value.  I know I will encourage any child of mine to jump into other languages and cultures.  It may well be that many parents in this country don't have it at the front of their mind.  Things being what they are, the parents who see the value will help their children out, and those parents that don't consider it will have children that are focussed on other things, and this applies across the board - to appreciation of science, the arts, etc and just plain seeing the point of learning things.  It'll be a long wait before the state manages to foster this appreciation country-wide... in the meantime, we must give our loved ones the tools and inspiration we can.",0,1398438691,null,0,false,0,ch1rke4,t3_23y6lt,t1_ch1rke4,t3_23y6lt,null,1433516223,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4
true,[deleted],null,null,"Spoiler - it doesn't. Almost every country requires a working knowledge in that language. Look at Germany that wouldn't even give you an interview without a CV in German and fluency in German. And Germans speak exceptional english.

Then look at Spain/Italy/France/Portugal where even in the big cities the average person doesn't speak great english and your chances have gone from maybe to zero. France and Spain have VERY, very good translation/dubbing of popular works into French or Spanish making it a much harder bet. When I was living in Lyon Matt Damon did an interview and they literally dubbed over him live and people generally weren't comfortable conversing in English (some brits/americans put it down to ""french pride"" but i genuinely believe because of how widespread french is they haven't had the americanisation smaller countries like Holland/Scandinavia have because their dubbing &amp; arts industry is so good so people are either only consuming french arts or arts that have been redubbed or written into french).

Holland/belgium (the dutch side of belgium) would probably be your best bet as they reasonably like British culture, speak exceptional english and with Amsterdam as big as it is a lot of working envrionments are in English - but you're still at a disadvantage to an average dutchmen. But then they have similar weather to the UK, and taxes are so high you might be sick (road tax is like 120 euros a month in Holland just on a bog standard car). 

Scandinavia you might fare better in the big cities but then you're at a disadvantage because the cities tend to favour hiring locals over foreigners. The best Swede for the job is a common saying in Stockholm and same for the rest of Scandinavia.

The best way to move within Europe is to be head hunted - and no supermarket worker is getting head hunted. 

The good thing though is that if you go to another country you can get free lessons in that language provided by the government (the same way our ESL teachers studying for their CELTA's provide free English lessons to foreigners). 

That requires a decent amount of money  saved which isn't typical of the working class purely for the paltry wage their paid. So from a working class perspective it's not really as if you can just pick up and move within the EU. We're nowhere close to a united states of europe.

true,EvilTerran,null,null,"&gt; You sound like a prisoner in your own country.

You yourself have been saying that it's impossible to escape from the influence of government. In that case, if I'm a prisoner to anything, it's to a *global* tyranny of the majority -- evidently, the world over, the majority would rather have taxes, government, the rule of law, etc. My country is no more to blame than any other. (Not, I must add, that I personally consider public services funded by taxation to be tyranny -- but never mind that, I'm trying to find some common ground here.)

&gt; Everyday your government becomes less and less relevant [...] and every generation becomes more knowledgeable of the fact it's all immoral bollocks. [...] So much for democracy and having a voice right?

Well, yes, I'm with you on those points. I just don't believe that espousing anarchy, and opposing any-and-all government action as a matter of principle, is the way to fix it. I think these parts are where we differ:

&gt; Everyday your government [...] holds less and less sway [...]. So enjoy it while it lasts.

I just don't see the current state-and-taxation based model of society going away any time soon. It seems to me as unlikely as Marx's ""international communist revolution"" that's been stubbornly failing to materialise ever since he predicted it.

Even if that did happen, I very much doubt what came after would be any better. Government-proper at least has the vestiges of accountability to the masses -- should the current model go away, the forces that would become de-facto governments in its place would lack even that, I guarantee it. See... well, the aftermath of pretty much every revolution ever: the reign of terror, the rise of Stalin, the innumerable tin-pot post-revolution dictatorships across the world...

There will always be people at the top, and they will always abuse their power. Under the current model, we little people may have precious little control, but it's better than nothing.

He may let me off for a year or two, but at some point the price goes up. After 15 years my rent will be twice what is today, but a mortgage payment would have remained unchanged.

Your wage point is irrelevant*.

true,nineinchheel,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"Consider the following extract taken from the letters page of the Weekly Worker (the publication of the CPGB) dated 21st May 2009

Firstly, there can be no equivalence between the freedom of capital to move across national frontiers and the âfreedomâ of labour to do the same. Marx made it quite clear that there was no balance in the contract between the capitalist employer purchasing labourpower and the proletariat forced to sell it in order to survive. Similarly, the real freedom of choice that the capitalist has in the current deregulated  global economy to invest their capital where it would yield the greatest profit cannot be put on the same basis as the need of the proletariat to seek employment wherever it is to be found. The âfreedomâ of the  proletariat to cross national borders is in reality a coerced movement - in effect, a wageslave trade no less invidious because of its supposedly âvoluntaryâ nature. It is the consequence of the âpushâ of poverty and/or political oppression, and the âpullâ of usually false dreams and promises of wealth and success elsewhere. The âfreedomâ of the worker to
migrate is also an individual bourgeois right that needs to be considered
against a socialist collective responsibility to remain where they are
in the midst of their own family and the community that have âinvestedâ social capital in their upbringing. The impact of the migration of the most energetic, intelligent and hard working young men and women from their homes is devastating upon those left behind. The depopulation of Ireland and the highlands of Scotland gave enough of an example to Marx and Engels in their day of the wholesale destruction of long-established communities. No individual worker has a ârightâ to desert their own community and enter another in order to undercut and divide
the recipient society. Every worker, whatever their background, should be welcomed in another country so long as they abide by the hard-won terms and conditions established by the working class already settled on that territory.",0,1398440003,null,0,false,0,ch1s7df,t3_23vmmh,t1_ch1s7df,t3_23vmmh,null,1433516524,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Let's compare it to banking.  Banks have at least some incentive to keep consumer costs down, since when they don't customers leave them for other banks.  But given that banks collaborate on fees through back room deals (a la Libor) one cannot argue that they are keeping costs down through competition - rather, they are keeping prices similar through collusion.

Healthcare would be the same, with the additional cruelty that people with chronic diseases or serious medical needs would not have the ability to change their suppliers, because the market would be small and there would ultimately be little difference between the 'competing' entities.

Providers are completely separate. You can go to a GP, then a specialist and then a hospital. You had better make sure that you have all information with you, otherwise the next stage will have to repeat tests. 

There is little control preventing service providers from attempting to maximise income (extra tests, hospital stays up to a week longer than the NHS). All patient consumables have to be billed so there is a massive administrative layer charging patient insurers per aspirin.

There are no incentives to lower costs (because the government can't go to a competitor) or to improve quality (because the government can't go to a competitor).  Just as importantly there is no option to not have the service because people will die.  By privatising you can create competition (even if that competition is only the knowledge that you will lose your contract for that area because a nearby area has a contractor who is outperforming you).
2. Having an insourced NHS means there are a number of overheads that you pay for whether you need them or not.  By outsourcing, you put that risk and resource back onto a private organisation to pick up the slack.

You might change your mind if you or your family were dependant on medical care to survive. 

I don't mean to suggest it should be the last thing to cut, but it's considerably more important than many things that aren't being forced to cut (and that only benefit a small section of society). 

Is a slightly faster rail journey for some individuals more important than medical care that keeps my son alive?

There has got to be some middle ground between us sitting in darkened rooms starving to death, but with excellent health care. And having to turn people away from medical treatment because of lack of funds, but having expensive nuclear weapons that's only purpose is for cock measuring purposes in international diplomacy?

The problem is that when the NHS was born, the country owed a massive debt to it's population for the suffering endured in the war and the thinking in British society at the time was ""helping others to help yourself"". 

Now after a shocking turn about in the 1980's the country is all about ""me! Me! ME!"" (or at least that's what the politicians and newspapers seem to think). Spending has gone from the masses to the few and it's only getting worse.

Never mind that Bale was the focal point of our 2012-2013 campaign and he is now the most expensive player in the world.

The story could just as easily been, ""Bale leaves and Spurs manage to maintain their Europa position.""  Was status quo this season really a failure?  Granted I think we could have played much better, but a lot of things went really wrong (injuries, ade's demotion/promotion, manager change), and we still managed to stay in the top end of the PL in one of the most competitive seasons ever.

Let's look at our purchases:

Eriksen:  Success

Capoue:  Injured

Paulinho:  Long-term injury, marginal success

Lamela:  Injured

Chadli:  Wasn't given any playing time for 80% of the season, and I'd rate his last few weeks as successful

Soldado:  We can debate this one for forever, but I'd say those few weeks where we actually stuck with the 4-4-2 and he and Ade linked up was the best we played all season.

Chiriches:  Long-term injury, but didn't he win MOTM in one game?

I'd rather see failure as totally be out of favor.  Nearing the end of the season, the Magnificent Seven are all either finding regular playing time or injured.  That really isn't a total bust.

true,Basmati_Rice,english,England,"&gt;You yourself have been saying that it's impossible to escape from the influence of government. In that case, if I'm a prisoner to anything, it's to a global tyranny of the majority -- evidently, the world over.

Yeah exactly. Democracy is majority vote over the minority and the individual. No matter how morally right or wrong it is.

&gt;. I just don't believe that espousing anarchy, and opposing any-and-all government action as a matter of principle, is the way to fix it. I think these parts are where we differ:

The reason I oppose all government action, well the main reason is because it's funded through theft and it's pretty rich having a government telling you it's immoral and against their law to steal someone's possessions or property when that's how they make their money. You might have a government party that was in line with some of my views, maybe they want to minimize or completely dissolve the government but to fund that they would still need to steal from the same people they claim to help. At least in the mean time of them reaching their goal (if they actually did). Also voting in a sense is written permission for a party to rule you. You can't have a morally sound government regardless of what goals they say they want to reach. That's why I oppose it.

&gt;I just don't see the current state-and-taxation based model of society going away any time soon. It seems to me as unlikely as Marx's ""international communist revolution"" that's been stubbornly failing to materialise ever since he predicted it.

I don't think they'll be a violent revolution and I don't think it will happen over night or even during either of our life times but it will happen and already is. Albeit very slowly.

&gt;Government-proper at least has the vestiges of accountability to the masses

That's false. I can safely say our government does things you don't like. Does the fact you disagree make it change? No. What about war? Was Tony Blair and George Bush or their parties held responsible for the people that lost their lives in the middle east, even if those said people were involved or not? No. Government officials are not accountable for what they do. They do what you like and you grin and bear it. They can literally get away with murder.

&gt;There will always be people at the top, and they will always abuse their power. Under the current model, we little people may have precious little control, but it's better than nothing. ""DemocÂ­racy is the worst form of GovÂ­ernÂ­ment, except for all those other forms that have been tried"", an' all that.

Your government is supposed to work for you. but realistically you literally work for your government. You pay their way not because you choose to it's because they take it by force and you're right there will always be someone who has more, and holds more sway but where you choose to take your business is very powerful. You can't take your business away from your government because they forcefully take their fee like some mafia extortion ring.

If you had choice in everything. From who protects you and your family, to who might perform life saving surgery on you. or be on the watch to make sure a fire doesn't break out in your house. Those powerful people are there only because you physically put them there, and it's not like in democracy where they get a 4-5 year run regardless of how bad they are at their job. If they do something you don't like you can go elsewhere that very day. They're powerful because you pay them. That's way more control that you currently hold in our current democracy (which it barely even is)

We have social media now as well, if someone high up did something in business, all you need to do is type a sentence to your friends and family and they won't use that specific business, and their friends and family won't and so on. They have direct interest in providing a service that you find acceptable, if they don't they won't have a service to provide very long. You now have a voice, a real voice unlike you're current voice in democracy that politicians will ignore when some company gives them a couple of quid to change their mind.

Democracy might be the worst form of government except for all the others. but who says we need someone to govern?

That was long and no disrespect to you if I've insulted you along these many many replies but I strongly believe this shit and I know I'm very much in a minority here but that won't stop me saying how I feel regardless of how many imaginary internet points I lose or how many people tell me to move to Somalia.

I guess what I'm suggesting is that we'd scrap History, Geography, R.E, Citizenship, PSHE, etc and work them into appropriate language based courses.

For example, rather than having 1 or 2 lessons a week on German language, that's expanded to perhaps 4 or 5, and the curriculum expands to cover Weimar and Nazi Germany, Turkish immigration (pretty sure that came up in Geography?), the Rhein, major religions, etc. If it was taught from Year 7-11 you may have to focus more on basic language skills in the first two years, but then once they're in place then you'd spend less time on them, and confidence in the language and new vocabulary would come from learning other subjects in that language.

You could take the same approach to teaching a second language, and further reinforce it by teaching other courses (Art, Music, Drama, PE, D&amp;T) in the second or third language too.

Is 10-12 GCSE's a normal workload? That'd be English Language, Maths, 2 or 3 Sciences, ""German Studies"" (2.5 GCSE's), ""French/Spanish studies"" (2.5) then PE and an arts subject on top of that. Similar content, but you've then got a little under half taught in English, and the rest split between two languages.  

To do it would be a huge shift, and probably not cheap, but I don't think it'd be impossible. Retraining current teachers to teach in a foreign language many probably don't already speak would be the tricky bit, but an overhaul of the way we train teacher's should render this less of a problem long term.",0,1398441276,null,0,false,0,ch1stsu,t3_23y6lt,t1_ch1stsu,t1_ch1rke4,null,1433516818,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

40 year olds who don't do modern technology are rare - if you're 40 and don't have a mobile phone and access to a computer and the internet at home you're weird. 50 year olds who don't are somewhat surprising. 60 year olds who don't are fairly common.

Even if you take the issue to a tribunal (after having worked for them for 2 years minimum and paying ~Â£1000 for the pleasure) they can just say they were giving you all the hours they were obligated to in the contract.

This is 100% to do with Islam, and very little else. Many young people will clearly find this calling strong, and that's what this 'religion' plays off of. 

Quran 9:081-096:

Those who remained behind rejoiced in their staying [at home] after [the departure of] the Messenger of Allah and disliked to strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah and said, 'Do not go forth in the heat."" Say, ""The fire of Hell is more intensive in heat"" - if they would but understand.

So let them laugh a little and [then] weep much as recompense for what they used to earn.

If Allah should return you to a faction of them [after the expedition] and then they ask your permission to go out [to battle], say, ""You will not go out with me, ever, and you will never fight with me an enemy. Indeed, you were satisfied with sitting [at home] the first time, so sit [now] with those who stay behind.""

And do not pray [the funeral prayer, O Muhammad], over any of them who has died - ever - or stand at his grave. Indeed, they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and died while they were defiantly disobedient.

And let not their wealth and their children impress you. Allah only intends to punish them through them in this world and that their souls should depart [at death] while they are disbelievers.

And when a surah was revealed [enjoining them] to believe in Allah and to fight with His Messenger, those of wealth among them asked your permission [to stay back] and said, ""Leave us to be with them who sit [at home].""

They were satisfied to be with those who stay behind, and their hearts were sealed over, so they do not understand.

But the Messenger and those who believed with him fought with their wealth and their lives. Those will have [all that is] good, and it is those who are the successful.

Allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally. That is the great attainment.

And those with excuses among the bedouins came to be permitted [to remain], and they who had lied to Allah and His Messenger sat [at home]. There will strike those who disbelieved among them a painful punishment.

There is not upon the weak or upon the ill or upon those who do not find anything to spend any discomfort when they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger. There is not upon the doers of good any cause [for blame]. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

Nor [is there blame] upon those who, when they came to you that you might give them mounts, you said, ""I can find nothing for you to ride upon."" They turned back while their eyes overflowed with tears out of grief that they could not find something to spend [for the cause of Allah ].

The cause [for blame] is only upon those who ask permission of you while they are rich. They are satisfied to be with those who stay behind, and Allah has sealed over their hearts, so they do not know.

There are no fewer than 150 more verses like this in the 'holy' book. There is little wonder so many young Muslims are desperate to join this fight. If you believe in this shite, then why wouldn't you?

A 4-3-3 could have two holding midfielders or just the one, with two attacking midfielders. Obviously a 4-2-3-1 is a bit more structured with two definite defensive midfielders. 

But I do get what you are saying, BR plays his team to the point where it could almost be said is formation-less. Gerrard more often than not plays almost smack bang in between the defense instead of at the pivot of the midfield. The front three (or even four) chop and change throughout the game. Suarez almost seems to have free roam - he's usually all over the bloody pitch. 

I don't really pay attention to our ""formation"" considering how unpredictable it is throughout the game. But there are other teams who definitely play by a structured formation, and it's incomparable to the way that Liverpool play.

true,Evis03,cnty-uk,Welshman-on-Mersey,"First, you asked if that money went back into the NHS, I said I didn't know but thought the question was invalid. You didn't ask if the taxation covered the cost. the article suggests nothing different because I never claimed sin tax covered the cost of the health bills to begin with.

Second, if you want to look at this as just numbers you're going to oversimplify the entire thing. That tax money stops people smoking which reduces the cost of treatment as well providing funding for those that continue. Anti smoking campaigns cost money but also potentially reduce the cost of treatment. Simply pointing at the current crop of in and out figures and making claims that the sin tax doesn't cover the entire cost is failing to account for other factors.

Third, you didn't even read your own article. Go back, try again and pay attention to what the numbers actually are instead of just picking a big one. Here's a clue, the figure you quoted as 'suggesting differently' is NOT the one associated with NHS costs, which was the assertion you made initially.

&gt;Does the money earned from taxing cigarettes **go back into the NHS?**

Looking at the actual tobacco costs to the NHS quoted in your article against revenue, and they come up similar. If you want to compare the 'societal impact' number, then you also need to include the other economic activities of tobacco companies too (providing jobs etc). Societal cost/revenue is an entirely different affair from healtcare cost/revenue.

The agreement is still in negotiation; negotiations aren't expected to be concluded until late this year/some time next year, due to several sticking pointsâincluding your example of private service providers.

Once the FTA has been fully negotiated, it will then be voted upon by the member states of the EU in the EU Council of Ministers. Should it pass that vote, it will then be passed to the European Parliament for another vote. After that, it is likely that some, if not all, member governments would need to ratify the agreement themselves (the French constitution states that trade treaties can only be ratified by a law; in the US, the Congress would have to ratify the text.)

So it's hardly an inevitable requirement; nor is the FTA a done-deal, or even close to one.

For the high achieving types maybe. I was by any measure among the top students at my school and I was doing about 11.5 (the half was a mandatory ""short course"" in Religious Studies, which had a year's worth of content dragged out across 2 years)

Full list was Maths, Statistics, English Language &amp; Literature, 3 separate sciences, RS, and 4 options which for me were IT, French, D&amp;T Graphics and Sociology. PE was on the timetable but wasn't something I did exams in or got a GCSE from.

BT are not allowed to pull the kind of stunt you're suggesting where they preferentially treat their own ISPs at the expense of competitors and there are hefty penalty clauses for doing so plus the regulator would vice-lock their balls for it.

One way or another everything has to be paid for, it's just a question of how much and when and of course who.

Which is better for a nation as a whole? I honestly don't know, although I'm sure people have strong opinions on the matter. You think that society is better off with more people in the underclass and no medical taxes? I'm not being perjorative here, I'm honestly asking you if you think things would be better.

Some details...

* 4,800sq ft farmhouse.
* 4.5 Acres of gardens and paddocks.
* 6 Bedroom (two are pretty small attic rooms though)
* Situated pretty much equidistantly between Nottingham, Leicester &amp; Melton (about 15-20 mins from each).
* Multiple outbuildings with existing planning for office developments (potentially could be transferred to residential planning).

They paid Â£365k for it, although it needs some money spending as the interior is pretty dated.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As someone who works for the competition, this is great.  But if you are invested in RBS or have any stake in them doing well (which at this point is every British citizen) this is an unbelievably terrible idea.

RBS isn't just British, it owns banks around the world.   It's also in the complete shitter at the moment.  And now this action is tantamount to saying to their best employees in America, in Asia, in Japan, in Africa that ""sorry guys we can't pay you your bonus because the British government decided to ban us from doing so"".  

Faced with the loss of their bonuses, what are RBS' best employees (the very few ones they have left as they've haemorrhaged talent over the past three years)  going to do?   

1.) They're going to leave.  Banking is hiring again, and regardless of the economic situation if you're a top guy whose done well (and remember you can still do well even if the company as a whole is losing money) there are lots of people on the lookout to recruit you.   

2.) They're going to demand that instead of a bonus, they get their bonus 'paid' to them in the form of a higher salary.   This means that the money is guaranteed rather than a reward for good performance, significantly reducing the incentive to do well (since they know they're getting the cash).  

In essence, they'll see a further drain of the best employees (the only ones who have any hope of returning the business to profitability), while being forced to pay for existing talent they can't afford to lose by massively raising base salaries, removing the entire incentive to do well in the process. 

All the people arguing that bank employees should be paid the same as government bureaucrats or nurses or whatever, well, you may well have a point!  But unless you convince every single bank on planet earth to pay their employees those kinds of salaries, RBS exists in a competitive environment.  If I pay half what the competition does, I'm only going to get the people who failed to get hired by the competition!

true,TheObservantPheasant,null,null,"The word privatisation is thrown around a lot by the media here in Britain and, while what's being done has both benefits and downsides, it's more scaremongering by the media than anything else. The media has a way of making anything different look bad and this is largely a case of this.

The principles of the NHS are that healthcare is universal, free at the point of use and based on clinical need and not ability to pay. The ""privatisation"" currently being pushed through does not directly affect these principles and people who are in need of healthcare will not be turned away. The public facing components of the NHS will still look and feel the same.

The main change being done is that some services will be provided by companies external to the NHS, but will be commissioned by the NHS, which means the money used to provide your treatment in the past is now being used to pay the company providing your treatment. The reasoning behind this is that the private companies may be able to provide you the same service as the NHS but at a lower cost, and the companies will be given the opportunity to do so provided that they meet a certain standard of care.

While this may seem a novel concept in terms of providing care, it's already being done throughout the NHS for cleaning services, IT, maintenance etc. This can be done because of the NHS's collective bargaining power - the NHS is the only provider of state-funded care, so being contracted to provide services to the NHS means the company has an effective monopoly (a very attractive prospect for a private company) and they will compete with each other for this opportunity. The company involved will need to keep costs low and/or improve the standard of care or risk losing their contract to another company.

The same principle also applies to pharmaceuticals. Any drug companies who wish to supply drugs to the UK will need to supply to the entirety of the NHS, or none of it. This all-or-nothing approach means the drug companies will lower their prices to a level that is attractive to the NHS (to an extent). The benefits of this can easily be seen by looking to the United States, where there is no single payer and drugs cost significantly more than the UK.

Also worth noting is that this ""privatisation"" is not happening in Wales (I'm not aware of what's going on in Scotland and NI), and the Welsh Government scrapped the ""purchaser-provider split"" in 2009 (a complex system introduced by Thatcher's government where the people paying for the service were not the same as those providing the service, also known as an ""internal free market"").

Edit: **TL;DR - The NHS is safe (for now) and you won't be paying any more for treatment, but you can move to Wales and avoid the ""privatisation""!**",0,1398449090,null,0,1398449794,0,ch1wssm,t3_23xwsk,t1_ch1wssm,t3_23xwsk,null,1433518754,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

true,Kesuke,null,null,"My guess is, as much as the conservatives may actually support introducing measures that would open up the healthcare market via back doors like this, the healthcare systems of other European nations are equally vulnerable to being fully exposed to US competitors... so there are likely to be pan-european exemptions to protect EU member states respective health industries. Basically, I don't think there is anything in this story. We aren't going to see big US providers like *[kaiser permanente](http://www.kaiserpermanente.org)* setting up shop and displacing the NHS overnight. Furthermore, the NHS is effectively in state possession of all the healthcare infrastructure (e.g. hospitals) - meaning anyone setting up over here will actually have to physically construct, staff and fill a hospital with all the expensive things that make it function. That will make competing with the established NHS very expensive... they'll also have to do it without NHS level access to the Royal Colleges and Deaneries, who provide the middle grade doctors that actually carry out the bulk of a hospitals day to day running. 

**Remember**: Health is both an expensive and lucrative industry depending on how you look at it. It's one of the biggest single-ticket items of expenditure from our GDP, so the last thing anyone wants to do is start fucking around with it too aggressively if that increases costs.

**Now also remember**: Healthcare is a big big deal in the US, because healthcare = big bucks. President Obama largely got elected on a ticket of major healthcare reform. Institutions like the American Medical Association (the US equivalent of the BMA) are incredibly powerful politically. The private healthcare giants like Permanente are also extraordinarily influential via lobby groups. The last thing the US will want is to have European providers setting up shop in the USA, and providing better services with better outcomes at lower costs. That's like their worst fucking nightmare... because the bottom line is the US providors know they provide the worlds 37th ranked healthcare service - for the number 1 ranked cost and virtually every European nation has better healthcare in terms of most global rankings. After a decade of political wrangling over healthcare reform in the USA, nobody over there is going to want to upset the applecart with an EU-US trade agreement.

**tl:dr**: The FTA might open up the healthcare market a little, but the NHS is in such a privileged monopoly position that it isn't going to be displaced **unless the alternative is better** and people actually vote with their wallets.

We should be more picky about the skills of the people we allow to work here. We should be picky over how much they'll have to earn and ensure that everybody who should be paying their way is. I wouldn't move to another country, whether in the EU or not unless it was for a job that I held qualifications and skilled for  - not everybody could do your job of Software Developer for example.

It's a difficult stance to make.

There are significant up-front-costs when buying, and a potentially very large deposit that can't be invested elsewhere.

Meanwhile, renting is (practically everywhere I've seen) cheaper per-month, so not only can you invest what would have been your deposit, but also add to it.

Eventually though, inflation will cause rent rises increasing your costs, while people's mortgages won't have gotten larger (well, not if they've got any sense) - although people may be surprised by interest raises and non-linear house price inflation, it's not all plain-sailing, not by a long way.

But it does take years for this cross-over to take effect.  Someone who buys a house won't show any real gain over a renter for years...

In a closed system, I think subsidies would probably be the best way to ensure healthcare for the poor. However, a given country does not exist in a vacuum...as a result, welfare programs such as this are implicitly held up by immigration restrictions. If anyone in the world could walk into your country, single-payer systems would quickly devolve into a situation with unacceptably low quality, and subsidy systems would be overwhelmed by cost (or would spread the money so thin as to make it meaningless). Since the true poor are global immigrants (for a sense of scope, a 40hr/week minimum wage job in the US still puts a person in the top 10% of global income), the truly compassionate thing to do is to open the borders.

Like for like it really isn't. You're probably prepared to rent a shit hole for a cheap rate, but if you're looking to buy you wouldn't consider the same property. Where I am looking monthly mortgage payments generally seem to be at least Â£100 less per month than rental rates. If it was the case that renting was cheaper than a mortgage the buy to let market would be much smaller than it currently is and house prices would not be rising so sharply. I suppose it depends what area of the country you're in though as where I am property prices are rising over 10% year on year right now which is more than you could reasonably hope to make by investing unless you're prepared to take some risks.

Due to the deposit, they are bound to get back at least what you owe them, even if the market has fallen a bit, even if they have to sell it cheap for a quick sale. There is probably going to be enough left over to cover their costs and any unpaid interest. Anything else goes back to the buyer (but it won't be much).

So if somebody lies to borrow more than they can afford, the bank don't really give a shit. The borrower is digging his own grave.

The only advantage to this scheme that I can see is that it maybe makes people think a bit more before they borrow recklessly. Reckless borrowing can be contagious.

Their issues with growth are in no small part due to their lack of easy interconnectedness. A HS line should go further than Leeds though, connecting with Newcastle and Hull. London's slice of the pie is unfairly large at the moment. Upgrades on the East Coast Main Line should be done to improve its speed and capacity, but I do feel that the 6/7ths of people who do not live in London ought to have the rejuvenating effects of modern public transport shared with them, and a cruxiform high speed network just makes sense. London is becoming a plughole draining the life out of the rest of the country. That's a bad deal for everyone. It makes London worse and it makes the rest of the country worse. 

There are a whole raft of things that need to be done to make non-London cities more appealing of course. Though no government or council can take credit for it, MediaCityUK in Manchester is a major step in the right direction - a modern, hi-tech complex which de-emphasizes London's place in the media. If the core cities focus on technology and hi-tech manufacturing, they can stay relevant, but that will take nation-leading infrastructure they are currently unwilling or unable to build. Central Government is no doubt significantly to blame, this administration's attack on vitally important quangos being just one signifier.

Our house for instance had loads of black mold that would grow on the walls all the time, no matter how much you cleaned them and the place itself was falling apart. Things would often be on the fritz.

Also it doesn't really work out to be much cheaper, you have to share your internet connection with X number of other people. You are also sharing a bathroom/shower with complete strangers who probably won't keep it clean.

You share a kitchen in private student accommodations, but you have people on the desk at these places 9-5 and also security on the desk whenever the management isn't there. So if your flatmates aren't keeping the kitchen clean, being noisy, or stealing your food/drink, you can complain to the desk and they will get kicked out.

Because private accommodations are also manned in such a way, they also have their own maintenance people who work on the site. Shower not working? They'll fix it within a day. Good luck trying to get a boiler repaired by a landlord who doesn't really give a shit (They'll send the cheapest plumber around and it'll take ages).

Also in private accommodations, all your bills are included (apart from internet). So you don't have to worry about paying your water, gas, electricity and phone bill. In a shared house, if people use a lot of hot water or always leave their lights on, you are essentially paying for that, because you would normally split the bill equally each month.

Also the bus from Smithdown to Uni and back is always packed. and it will cost you around Â£250 per year. 

Just be super cautious about going to live in a house with strangers, they are after all strangers and they could be awful to live with. From people I've known throughout Uni, people who lived in house shares are always really really really glad to either go live in private student halls or get their own place.


EDIT: Maybe I just had some bad experiences, and everyone I met may have had the same. I don't doubt that there are some really nice house shares out there, just know that it can be a bit of a lottery, especially if you don't know who you are living with.

It's easy for all the idiot fans who were questioning Rodgers into this season to eat their words now. Great. Good for you. But what're you going to do if next year we struggle? What're you going to say when we miss out on another top signing? Perhaps to Utd?

I hate fickle fans. I'm shocked we are where we are this season. I don't think anyone would've put the title within our reach if you were talking 2 seasons from now. But here we are.

That said, I'm still capable of seeing this as a project, knowing there's work to be done. I hope beyond hope that all these fans will act that way as well. Because I can already see us going through a rough spot next season, having missed out on some signing who's making Utd look like world beaters, and hearing these same fans saying things like, ""Last year was a fluke, we need to bring in a guy like Pep Guardiola or let's give Carra a shot"".

However this past summer we were coming off a record point haul in the league. Sandro had gotten hurt but prior to the injury we had lost a single match (if i am not mistaken) when Sandro and Dembele had played in the same midfield.

The idea was to add talent and depth to what we already had on the books.

Paulinho (who was a player AVB wanted) came in to pair with Dembele. Capoue came in to pair with Sandro after we sold Parker. We then had Eriksen, Holby and Siggy as potential players to use as CAM.

We needed more talent on the wings not an 8th CM.

Lamela was one of the top prospects in all of Europe coming off a season where he was the 5th highest scorer in Serie A. It was regarded as an absolute coup that we signed him.

On the other hand, their chances of winning the Champions League are fairly good (in comparison). They have to beat Atletico Madrid next Wednesday and then whoever they face in the final. In other words, it's in their own hands and they are more in control of their own destiny.

That's why Mourinho's saying he'll put out a weaker side on Sunday (which I don't believe anyway).

Sure, GDP or whatever is beginning to increase, but that's really only a fraction of the story - average wages are still down, especially in relation to the cost of living, or inflation - which is what really matters. People are able to buy less and less of the things they need on the salaries they're earning.

Salaries are *still* not keeping pace with inflation, so the money we're earning is on average, worth less and less each day.

Not to mention that the recovery in our economy is largely propped up by more speculation in property, which is another bubble waiting to burst, and the fact that nearly 100% of the ""recovery"" is happening in the south-east. Travel outside of London, things are a lot less optimistic.

Unemployment has gone down, great, but there's a lot more people who are underemployed, employed-part time, and on zero-hour contracts. So these people *might* be off the dole, but they're still not earning enough to live on, or enough to live on comfortably.

true,noghead,lfc99,,"Its Sunday, Chelsea are at Anfield and look like they will frustrate Liverpool -not by parking the bus like many expected but with stellar attacking football and getting 3 goals by the 90'th minute. The ""weaker"" team look better than the one that's suppose to play on Wednesday. Jose is hailed as a mastermind for motivating under performing players.

All is not well for Chelsea however, without the usual bedrock at defense, they have conceded 3 goal. One goal for Suarez and 2 for Sturridge.

The game looks to be headed towards a draw. Its a result that isn't going to help either team but its not terrible either. Jose is happy because things are looking good for 2nd leg of Champions League and Brendan Rogers figures its a decent result that still has Liverpool ahead of City by a point.

Both managers look to bring on substitutes in the dieing moments of the game. Torres comes on replacing Ba and Aspas replaces Sterling. Chelsea have the ball and are just passing it around in their own half. Desperate to get a touch on the ball before the final whistle blows, Torres comes back to pick up the ball. As he is about to turn and look up field, he is in immediate pressure from a relentless Suarez who is still pressing even in stoppage time. Torres turns back again shielding the ball and gives a back pass intended for the keeper....but no, Sturridge is there.

Its Sturridge, the unwanted Chelsea striker, on a hat trick. With a swing of his left boot he curls it past the keeper -CRACK!! It hits the woodwork. Anfield is silent and devastated...but wait! Its Aspas on the rebound, Iago Aspas taps it in with his first touch!!! Silence erupts to a roar!

The camera focuses in on Torres as it was his mistake that gave Liverpool the winning goal in the last minute of added time. A rueful look turns into a hint of smile. The Kop start singing his song

There are top-down limits to what can be charged by the private market for insurance that covers non-elective general and specialty medical care, as well as limits on what can be charged by private health care services and consumables providers. 

Insurers and providers both compete on a level playing field, not one in which each team decides where the goal post is, how many players are on the field, and how many points a goal is worth depending upon which stadium is filled.

For non-elective, medically necessary care, there is no financial incentive to turn away publicly insured patients in favor of those who are privately insured or paying out of their own pocket.

&gt;All examples of fighting in The Quran are related to self-defence of oneself or in defence of others who are clearly oppressed, never as aggressors, for example

&gt;Except for those who reach a people between whom you have a covenant, or if they come to you with a reluctance in their chests to fight you or to fight their own people. Had God willed He would have given them strength and they would have fought you. But if they retire from you, and did not fight you, and they offer you peace; then God does not make for you a way against them. [4:90]

&gt;And why should you not fight in the cause of God and the weak and oppressed among men, women and children who say, ""Our Lord rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors. And give us from You, a protector. And give us from You, a helper"" [4:75]

&gt;Retaliate with equivalence:

&gt;And if you take your turn, then retaliate with the like of that with which you were afflicted; but if you are patient, it will certainly be best for those who are patient. [16:126]

&gt;The sanctity of life:

&gt;For this reason did We prescribe to the children of Israel that whoever kills a soul, unless it be for murder or for corruption in the land, it is as though he killed all men; and whoever keeps it alive, it is as though he kept alive all men; and certainly Our messengers came to them with clear arguments...

true,Popeychops,lfc99,,"**Simple view**: Chelsea have to win three games in the league, and have other results go against their rivals in order to win the league now. It doesn't look likely. 

They have to win only two games in order to win the Champions League, regardless of how the other match goes. It's entirely down to how the team plays.

**A more subtle view**: It's a deception. Chelsea might play a ""weaker"" team, but it's far from being a ""weak"" team. Their investment in their squad will mean that their most likely XI on Sunday will be more expensive than Liverpool's entire squad of 25. The idea of Liverpool winning the league is embarrassing for teams like City, Chelsea, United and Arsenal, because Liverpool demonstrate an ability to do more with less.

So by suggesting that Liverpool are going to face a ""weakened"" team, it implies that it's a ""weak"" team, even though it isn't. It gives Mourinho that excuse in case Liverpool hammer them something silly (which remains a possibility even if the best availabe XI was picked, Liverpool are on a charge towards the finish now, and it's at Anfield. Liverpool almost embarrassed Chelsea on the away leg where Eto'o should have been sent off early on).

Not only that, but it plants the seed of complacency in the minds of the team. But Rodgers has worked under Mourinho before, he knows his M.O. Liverpool are ready for whatever team Chelsea field on Sunday, and Rodgers sees through the flimsy excuses. 

Chelsea don't worry me as much as Crystal Palace do. They haven't showed any interest away from home and will be torn apart if they try to have a go at Liverpool. They have to take care of three central threats: Suarez, Sturridge and Sterling. They have to weather a storm at any set-piece they concede, because we're rather good at them.

true,[deleted],null,null,"That is codshit. You honestly think Mohammed managed to go from one end of Arabia to the other fighting, and took all that land in self defence? Pull the other one. Mohammed would 110% be behind his followers going and fighting in Syria. He himself attacked Christians in Syria, purely for the purpose of furthering his cult. 

If you can quote that site, surely I can go ahead and quote thereligionofpeace.com? Didn't think so. 

Any way, here's some examples of Mo Mo fighting aggressively, and no t in self defence:

Volume 3, Book 46, Number 717:
Narrated Ibn Aun:

I wrote a letter to Nafi and Nafi wrote in reply to my letter that the Prophet had suddenly attacked Bani Mustaliq without warning while they were heedless and their cattle were being watered at the places of water. Their fighting men were killed and their women and children were taken as captives; the Prophet got Juwairiya on that day. Nafi said that Ibn 'Umar had told him the above narration and that Ibn 'Umar was in that army.

There are no passages talking about Mohammed trying to make peace with these otherwise peaceful cattle grazers. 

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: If you come to a township (which has surrendered without a formal war) and stay therein, you have a share (that will be in the form of an award) in (the properties obtained from) it.  If a township disobeys Allah and His Messenger (and actually fights against the Muslims) one-fifth of the booty seized therefrom is for Allah and His Apostle and the rest is for you. (Sahih Muslim 4346)

As you can read (I hope), even if people weren't at war with Mohammed and merely resisted Muslim rule, they were subjugated. Resisting subjugation = Mohammed killing you and raping your women. So as you can see, Mohammed's bar for 'self defence' is non-existent or extremely low. 

Then the apostle sent Khalid bin Walidâ¦ to the Banu al-Harith and ordered him to invite them to Islam three days before he attacked them. If they accepted then he was to accept it from them, and if they declined he was to fight them. So Khalid set out and came to them, and sent out riders in all directions inviting the people to Islam, saying, âIf you accept Islam you will be safe.â So the men accepted Islam as they were invited. (Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 959)

The issues it picked up were mainly recent.


The report explained exactly what needed to be done and stated for a fact these were issues... if we had a homebuyers report it would only have 'suggested' that these issues be investigated further by a structural engineer.

A structural engineers report costs roughly the same as a homebuyers report (a little bit more if you include a roof inspection)... People think that a SE report will cost a huge amount more... really not the case.

I think there is much to be said for locals feeling their local community is being overrun due to unmanaged immigration. I think Peterborough is a classic example of this. (someone poke me for stats, but I'm on my phone). This has been caused by a large influx of immigrants in a very short period of time. This leads to people seeing their local shops changing, clientele in their pubs and cultural shifts happening so quickly people can't adjust. This can also lead to the immigrant community not adopting the local ways of life (doesn't mean they need indoctrinating, but there should be a healthy give and take). This typically happens with the large scale, low skilled (and therefore eastern European) immigration. Specifically exacerbated by the different policies during EU expansion. 

Immigration of skilled labour, particularly in tech and other high end industry, has never been a problem. I work for a small software consultancy in London and often jest that I'm the minority on our team. However the people I work with are highly skilled, fluent English speakers and drink with us at the pub after work. They are my colleagues, friends, and we have friendly banter over our national differences and histories, particularly the many ways all European nations have gone through. I love my foreign colleagues (mostly EU and Commonwealth) for all the bullshit we banter over st the pub after work, and whatever holidays, foods and customs they want to share.

It's not quite clear whether you're asking 'can a health professional carry something knife-like to save lives?', or 'can a health professional carry a shank and talk his way out of it if the police search him?' And I think the distinction will be crucial.

Because obvously, if you were after the former, there would be alternatives to a knife: powerful scissors with rounded instead of pointed tips; those hook-shaped webbing-cutters that can cut seatbelts. Items for different scenarios (e.g. a roll of bandages instead). A full first-aid kit.

If you're *not* carrying any other kit, just a lock-knife in your pocket, I think the argument that it's there to save lives is going to look like a flimsy attempt at justification.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; Although I don't see myself ever voting for UKIP based on a single policy, this policy does make sense, but only if they also introduce stricter guidelines on qualifications and job eligibility.

This has got nothing to do with UKIP really, more politics in general, but I don't really agree with this view on immigration.

One of the reasons people immigrate to the UK, and probably the main one discussed in the media, is economic. Wages are lower in places like Eastern Europe, so someone doing the same job in the UK and, say, Poland, would get paid a higher wage in the UK than Poland. They'd also have access to better public and social services. 

Now, I'm not sure why it's fair that I get those benefits. Why should I get higher wages and better public services simply because of where I was born? I'm not genetically or culturally superior to people from around the world in countries where they don't get those higher wages and better public services. That's why I think the view of UKIP, and quite a few Tories, not just in reducing immigration, but complaining about money that goes into the EU to help less economically advantaged countries, and wanting to drastically reduce the foreign aid budget, is pretty selfish. Their view is 'we've got ours, and it's not our problem that you haven't got yours', even though international economics and general human sympathy would suggest it is our problem.

I'm not suggesting here that we open the borders and let everyone move to the UK. What I am suggesting is that I support cooperation between countries to help everyone, and to improve the economic standards of people who are less advantaged for no other reason than the country they were born in. If we were able to increase the economic standings of people in these countries, there would be no economic reason to emigrate, so there would be a reduction in immigration overall, meaning we wouldn't need to pretty much close the borders. 

If one group of people in the UK had much worse economic standards than another group, we wouldn't build a wall around the richer group and say it isn't our fault the other group is poor, we would try to help them. I don't see why we don't do that with other human beings. ",0,1398464306,null,0,false,0,ch23zki,t3_23z0ge,t1_ch23zki,t1_ch236qw,null,1433522205,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

He never had a love affair with Queen Sybella, but she had a leaporous brother, who was King of Jerusalem. When he died, it passed to Guy, Sybella's husband. He marched an army into the desert to support one of his men starting a new war with the Saladin, but at Hattin he was out-maneuvered and defeated. Bailin was there, and got away. He was then captured whilst fleeing, in another battle, at which point Saladin let him go in the promise he never raised arms again. He went back to Jerusalem, and was nominated to lead the defence, which he did. He also knights roughly 60 Knights from the Men at Arms there, and they held the city for a while. He then bartered peace with Saladin, who ransomed some of the civilians back. He put the rest into slavery, though some reports suggest that he let most of those go to, because he wanted to avoid a massacre like in 1099, during the First Crusade, when the Christians sacked Jerusalem and killed thousands of innocent civilians.

true,mister_zurkon,eng-durham,Durham,"I suspect a lot of people are just not convinced that paying large bonuses improves shareholder value at all.

It's quite possible that, regardless of the competitive environment, the size of bank bonuses simply represents management taking advantage of lax shareholders. (Banks are complex hence their management is mysterious, they have traditionally high profits that will discourage rocking the boat, and are largely owned by historically-inactive institutional investors).

As a thought experiment, if all the other banks were paying bonuses ten times as great, would RBS have to pay them too? A hundred times?  A thousand? Your point about 'the people who failed to get hired by the competition' is true, but RBS would still fill the posts, and if the competition couldn't create the extra value out of those top people it would be a net loss for them.

I'm not saying all of this is right and you're wrong. After all, in the complex world of international finance, the best people can probably generate absolutely shedloads more money.

true,Woodentop_renegade,null,null,"In England and Wales you may carry a knife which folds (must not lock) which has a cutting edge (blade) of no more than 3 inches in length. If it falls into that category, that's one thing. If it doesn't then you need to have lawful authority or a reasonable excuse. With the exception of folding pocket knives this goes for any sharply pointed or bladed article. Lawful authority is express and applies to (for example) an on duty squady carrying a bayonet as a part of their lawful duty. 

Reasonable excuse means having a good reason to carry the knife. A good reason means a specific need. A carpenter requires a Stanley knife, saws and so on for obvious reasons whilst he is working. The same carpenter does not need a stanley when he's down the pub. In the same way I wouldn't bat an eye-lid at an on duty paramedic carrying such a tool as they attend PI-RTCs and such a thing could be helpful I'd question their reasoning for carrying one off duty. 

To be honest if it concerns you that much I would purchase a Resqme tool. They're not expensive and they provide the best vehicle extrication capability you're going to get short of a Holmatro combined spreader and cutter.

I, personally, think we should tie Barry down as a top priority. His work with McCarthy has been nothing short of excellent. Re-loan Deloufeu if it's possible. 

Next, inquire about Lukaku. Get him for Â£20m or less, but no more. If we're outpriced, we should go for Bony. TraorÃ© should be re-loaned should Monaco allow it. 

A few more midfield options would be helpful as well. I don't think Cleverly is who we need but he could be a good rotation player. If we had the chance, I'd take Lallana as first choice. Then Holtby if we can't get him. 

Our options at RB are fairly limited. Coleman is great but if he gets injured is Hibbert really the man to cover for him? Stones proved in the derby that its not his position. I for one would take Richards but he's set for Liverpool if you believe what you read in the papers. Still, he's out of contract at the end of the season. 

Our squad is actually quite strong and a lot of players we could sign would probably not start every game for us, and it's hard to pick players that you want to bring in solely to warm the bench, so it's tricky.

That shouldn't be taken to mean that Italy (my country btw) has a mixed public\private system though. The system is almost entirely public, but the expenditures in healthcare are partly financed by the state and partly covered by the patients themselves (generally at subsidized prices). For example, non-lifesaving drugs have to be paid at the point of purchase even though they are dispensed through the public system; many medical exams also have a 'sticker price' (almost always subsidized) that the patients cover with their own funds. But for the vast majority of people, all medical professionals they are ever going to meet and all healthcare institutions they are ever going to make use of are public.

The system as it is now provides a balance between the advantages of single-payer systems (we buy supplies in bulk and can negotiate heavy discounts) and the budget constraints that make it impossible to finance it completely through taxes (lifesaving or necessary treatments are still free in any case).",0,1398470331,null,0,false,0,ch26g9n,t3_23yild,t1_ch26g9n,t1_ch238y7,null,1433523366,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The only reason he gets such leeway is that he's English, and he's England's number one.

That isn't enough for me.

I can count half a dozen keepers just in this league that I'd sooner have than Joe, and Lloris would be top of that list.

We keep possession, our goalkeeper usually doesn't have much to do, he just needs to keep a cool head and remain composed and focused to switch on when he's called upon.

That keeper is not Joe Hart.

We need a keeper who can play it out of the back, has good distribution, and can read danger. We need an intelligent keeper who has a calming influence on his back four, a reassuring sense of control. A keeper with a calm head.

Joe Hart has none of those qualities. None.

I carry [this](http://www.schmalhaus.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_5712-8.jpg) most of the time as having a pocket knife is just useful (only today I used it to pry a atm receipt out of the machine it was jammed into). What you cannot do is carry a locking knife of any size or a fixed blade knife, and the legal non-locking folding knife becomes an offensive weapon if it's used as a weapon (although, so would a copy of the Bible).

If you are a police office, what would your view of [this](http://www.desirethis.com/images/entries/661/1793/1793-1280.png) or [this](http://www.patrolstore.com/media/catalog/product//g/e/gerber_strap_cutter_black.jpg) be? I've been in a car wreck before, and while my car has a strap cutter attached to the dashboard now, having one on my bag would keep my mind easy. Both are designed to cut belts and break glass, but are made for the military and are angled in such a way as to make it safe to cut clothes off of people without cutting the person. The first one is deffinately something I would see as sensible for medics to keep about them (again, unless they are at a bar).",0,1398472873,null,0,false,0,ch27glk,t3_23zigi,t1_ch27glk,t1_ch23phc,null,1433523841,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

If you are caught doing something bad by the police and you have a knife on you (even if it's a 1"" rusty swiss army knife with no edge that needs pliers to open and is in the bottom of your bag), they will probably class that as having an offensive weapon on you.

true,Melberger,null,null,"Unless we pull off the spectacularly implausible and win the league, ultimately; no.

The league campaign is the ultimate measure of a club's progress, and there has been no discernible progress here.

We have wasted opportunity after opportunity to take a lead at the top. We started the season very poorly, transition period mitigates it somewhat, but in essence that period will cost us this year.

We turned it around and played the best football in the league for a period of around 3 months, since the loss to Chelsea we've tailed off, and again, thrown several opportunities to close in on the title.

I firmly believe that we rely too heavily on a core of key players. The likes of Silva, Yaya and Aguero. Many of the rest are peripheral figures, whose contribution is fleeting and inconsistent. Should we miss the influence of a key player these peripheral figures fail to rise to the plate and lead.

No better example of that than against Sunderland the other week. A key fixture against a side that had a handful of points in their last 8 fixtures. A fixture that would've seen us still in with a realistic shout of the title should we have come away with the 3 points, as it turned out we were lucky to come away with 1.

I think we don't have enough hungry players with a desire and courage around those key players. We have too many talented, but comfortable players.

Players earning a fortune with a few medals to their name, who are content with their lot. Great example of everything I've highlighted would be Nasri.

We need more hungry and young players with the talent and desire to drag us over the line when we falter. We don't have that at present. We need players like that around that core of key players, otherwise we're often outfought by inferior teams with the desire we lack.

The key players don't lack this desire, but the peripheral figures earning a fortune and content with their lot do.

And it isn't good enough.

It's frustrating to think we've pissed away the opportunity to win 2 or 3 back to back titles due to this lack of fight and desire. Due to an arrogance, an absence of courage and metal.

It's galling to think that we regressed last season, after winning the title in spectacular fashion (when the whole of the league feared we'd go on to become a real force and dominate), to concede our title miserably to an entirely average United side, and now this season to have a stuttering challenge and watch as Liverpool leapfrog above us from 7th to Champions.

Its all good and well being content with our lot, given where we've come from, but after many a deep reflection, I really believe we've underachieved hugely since Sergio's spectacular last gasp winner against QPR on that glorious Sunday May 13th 2012.

I still recall the fear among our rivals after that title, fear that we'd cement that title and become a dominant force.

It never happened.

We had divisions at boardroom level, on transfer spending that summer. We had divisions with Mancini his players and staff. We had injury problems.

Likewise this season, really unfortunate with injuries to key players.

But nonetheless, the fact that we have underachieved so greatly with the talent at our disposal, at a time when our rivals have been vulnerable, is particularly disappointing.

I think this season we've underachieved, and we only have ourselves to blame.",0,1398475176,null,0,1398475430,0,ch28dg0,t3_23oyzc,t1_ch28dg0,t3_23oyzc,null,1433524275,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

When I was around 16 I used to go fishing with friends on a Saturday.

This one occasion I had do something on the morning so my friends went early and I travelled by my self and met up with them.

I got the bus into town then had to walk through the city centre on my way to the river where we fished.

I was wearing my waterproofs, carrying a rather large fishing seat box on my back with my fishing rod in my hand.  So it was obvious where I was going.

I was stopped by a policeman who asked what I was doing and where was I going.

He wanted to see my fishing licence,  which you don't need to have for salt water fishing.

He didn't like that so decided he wanted to search me to see if I had something on me I shouldn't have.

I did have a swiss army knife in the bottom of my tackle box which took him some time to find.

I was told it was an offence to be carrying a knife in a public place so he would have to confiscate it.

He said because I didn't know he wouldn't take it any further and he would dispose of it in a knife amnesty bin.

I was pretty gutted to lose it as it was a present a relation had brought me back from holiday.  I was made to feel like it was my own fault for carrying it, even though I did have a legitimate use for it.

What really pissed me off though was just next to where he stopped me all the Goths used to hang around. 

There was about 5 of them stood yards away with those chains hanging off their trowsers,  one of them had this metal claw thing on his hand.  All of which could have done far more damage to someone than my piddly little Swiss army knife which wasn't even that sharp.
