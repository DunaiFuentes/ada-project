**SORRY THIS WAS A LITTLE LONG**

I'm not one for ""circle jerking"" (I do it a tad bit with Ladmela) But Soldado is far from our third choice. Definitely not our first choice however though. Yes, he had a really rough first season but that was a non-Bale AVB system which was destined for failure and my main man Tactics Tim. Ade did find somewhat of his old self under Timmy, which I'm thankful for, and he deserves to be our first choice. However, why would we choose Kane as a second choice over Soldado? Yes, I know Kane is English but Soldado I feel is still better than Kane. Soldado hasn't really had the chance to prove himself. Poch is getting it out of him which is why I'm loving the Poch system so far. It's the beginning of the new season anyways, everyone is going to get their turn in, that's why Bobby isn't starting so I don't know why everyone is asking that (plus, I still would give the start to Ade anyways, him and Eriksen just seem to understand each other on the pitch, then again, so does Ladmela and Bobby.) Though, I will say Bobby should be getting played over Ade because Ade's fitness isn't ready yet. He didn't play much pre season at all compared to Bobby. To wrap it up, Adebayor should be our first choice, Soldado our second and Kane our third. Kane simply shouldn't be second choice over Soldado. There is one condition that fights that order though, Bobby ends up doing badly then falls down a slot and Kane gets to start. Though, I'm not entirely convinced that will happen yet.

However the gap between both of them and Ade, currently, is undeniable. You're 100% correct, if Soldado finds his shooting boots from Spain, he's clinical and if we end up with those two battling it out then that could be special.

It's doing no favours to the people of Ardoyne either. It's the same thing as the mural in West Belfast that went up a while ago as well. You've elements of the community (In a lot of cases SF themselves) who want to constantly keep bringing up a past that has little relevance to the young people there or the issues they face.

The suicide rates and instances of depression amongst the young in these communities are far too high to be trying to force them to dwell on a troubled past like this. These kids need positive displays of culture, something positive they can feel a part of without feeling a need to be threatened by those who aren't. Something that makes them think toward the future and how they can have a positive place in it.

Whoever organised this ought to be utterly ashamed of themselves. They've done nothing good here.

true,puppetjustice,null,null,"As an ex financial advisor I can shed some information on this. (apologies if this has already been answered) 

the banks have very little interest in working for people. I worked for HSBC (who turned out to be amazingly evil) to leave and go to Natwest (who turned out to be also amazingly evil).  as the two of the top UK banks this is what you can expect and why.


personal accounts make a bank pretty much nothing. The reason they give 'normal' people accounts is because they use your money to prop up various funds while they play roulette with your money. Their bonus comes from charging people.  They will (and do) plan and make more money off people's charges and fees than they will off gambling with your money.  They will keep you around and pay lip service to you in the hope you will start incurring charges (which basically equals free money to them)  

their account opening bullshittery is directly related to how often they unjustly fucked the average consumer, who then panicked and tried to hide from his life destroying and psyche crushing debt.  The financial institutions actively seek out people who will need these products in the future. to start off with this seems innocent or at least a reasonable business practice, but it is far from. 

The banks actively employ staff to sift through their customer data to search for potential at risk customers. These customers are targeted as people who will,  with high certainty get themselves into further financial trouble, creating revenue streams for the banks. The personal circumstances are rarely considered and the banks pressure all staff from the counter to management  to increase the free services with the bank so you can sell unnecessary services to the customer.

the prospect of 'free' banking isnt considered anything special to the people who are unaware of the foreign banks charging for most services. but when they are made aware this is falsely attributed to the banks being nice to you or some UK claim to financial niceness.  This allows the banks to pass off their charges as reasonable to the customer considering their lack of charges otherwise. you can and will be allowed by all (of the major banks at least) your first two charges back. They are instructed to challenged you but if you persist it is (or was last year) a bank policy to refund 'reasonable' requests. 

This is where it goes wrong though.......


you are worthless to the banks. I don't care who you are or how big you think you, are there are richer and more important people than you, as far as the banks are concerned (it's the bank executives in case your wondering.)

banks are shareholder companies and their only concerns are meeting the global share index profit predictions (how much phat stacks they were planning on making off nice people).

 to do this they balance their insurance income (basically free money) minus against their predicted payouts to customers for accounts, insurance and interest (several departments jobs are to find any legal way to keep this as low as possible).  

Their stock price gambling income (it's not gambling really, all banks have very successful means of inflating their profits and stealing/robbing money for customers, trading, investments and futures....... or at the very worst they just tell the public to cough up huge sacks of cash.)  vs their investment debts (usually covered by tax payers. This all started again  after banks paid political figures for financial deregulation in the past 20-30 years. I can only certainly say us and UK for certain.) 


you bank accounts etc are a petty cash fund that takes up the slack. now admittedly that's a lot of waffle to get to the pint of why the banks don't give a fuck but you effectively do nothing for them, thus they couldn't give a shit.   The excess ID is so that if you have the cheek to play them at their own game and defraud them it allows them to hunt you nationally and depending on  the amount of money owed, internationally.   currently legislation stands at a 6 yr data limit.  so if you can avoid contact with the banks for what ever reason for 6 years they can no longer chase you for debt or fees.

hope this is helpful 



TL; DL: banks are fuckers and designed to sick money out of you. Our free banking is just a farce to lull you into debt. I worked for banks as was at meetings for these ideas to get implemented.  I left shortly after.

4: Ill people at work. This is partly ""stiff upper lip"". Also, ring in sick and you'll lose a sick day from your allowance. Have your boss tell you to go home, no frigin way am I taking a sick day cause my boss told me to leave. That's like taking holiday because I've been fired!

5: Da fuq else do you do with vinegar?

6: Seriously, drive on the left. There is no reason to hog the middle lane. Similarly, there is no reason to do 72MPH anywhere on the motorway. Do 55-70/80/90+ in the respective lanes.

7: Here was me thinking on street parking was pretty limited.

8-9: Taps and messy people, these piss me off as well.

10: Incompetence in services, yeah, see ""stiff upper lip"" and not complaining.

11: Insurance, I guess so. Very little is required though. I don't think I've ever had tennants insurance. You can choose to live the polish way and not have pet insurance? But what do you do in poland if your pet is injured/ill?

12..14: Agreed on the trains. And the Daily Mail. And Cameron is as bad as both combined.

15: Education, you might have just got unlucky and got a bad school. Or you might be clinging to some poor examples. Though I do see the benefits mentality more than I'd like. I think reflection is why people also think the easter europeans want to do the same. We've got a class of people in the UK who do not value themselves or working for themselves. This is a sad thing.

16: Phat amaze balls, self-service means I don't have to talk to bored old ladies on the till. Though, why would you use a walk around self scanner. I need things, I put them in my basket/trolley. I don't need a rolling total, I need the things.

17: No road police, but lots of static cameras. This bothers me to no end. I'd far prefer to see road police who can make judgement calls, and provide aid to people, than the fixed cameras we have all over the place causing people to emergency brake.

18: Sour cream has limited use. Off milk has none. Just sayin'

I was really looking forward to a new older doctor the way they have made him look and sound in interviews, trailers and such made him seem like a more mature doctor with a sense of responsibility. But, this first episode really let that down. 

With all the childish writing sounds effects and general silliness of it all and yea I get it it's a show who's target demographic is children but still. 

Also the inclusion though relative to the plot of Matt smith was a bad move in my opinion, they want people to move on and recognise that this is the doctor yet all I see in the comments is that their favourite part was matts cameo. It ruins flow of it all. 

I said this to my significant other that the episode really suffered from being a regelation episode meaning they are usually all the same all new doctors get written as a moron who can't control what comes out of there mouth until the very end where they 'discover themselves' (David after having his hand cut off, Matt after raiding the locker room, and Peter after leaving Clara behind) they all follow a trend that doesn't sit well with me.

However all of that being said I still liked it a lot more than I did Matt smiths first episode and by the end of his run I really enjoyed his doctor. So I won't see this as a definition of the series or of Peters doctor. 

TLDR: didn't like it liked it more than matts first episode still look forward to both peter and the series. ",0,1408999039,null,0,false,0,ck09s7k,t3_2ee4u1,t1_ck09s7k,t3_2ee4u1,null,1427362406,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

It's all well and good if your passing and mode meant is great in midfield, but if your defence and attack can't do the job, you're gonna lose a lot of games. Awareness was simply non-existant in the squad in the Etihad tonight.

First goal, Loven got caught too close to Skrtel and Moreno was flat-footed.

Second goal, the entire defence got caught running towards the ball. Other than Johnson, who was tracking back onto the line, nobody even considered the acre of space that was probably about 50x50 yards for anyone who wanted to use it.

The third goal, Lovren was weak. He got shouldered out by AGÜERO. He was caught in two minds, went to cut the ball out but didn't and was punished, also Mignolet left his line way too early and left a mass of space at his near post.

In attack, Sturridge did nothing. Had one or two decent moments but did nothing to actually benefit the team other than that. His movement was non-existant and he never actually looked like scoring at all. Sterling was good at first, great running, was showing for the midfield, and then it all dried up and stopped working. He was a shadow of himself in the second half.

""Yid"" is very different. The club has never appropriated the name. And the use of yid came about in a very different way. Tottenham has historically been an immigrant neighborhood. Early in the 20th century lots of German labor migrants settled in London. A few of the migrant laborers in Tottenham were also Jewish.

* Markovic looks right on track to be a great player

* Don't look into Moreno's performance too much, big task and thought he showed some good signs, as well as poor ones.

* Back four need to be organized better and we are still hurting without a true DM, that will haunt us all year I guarantee it. As long as Gerrard is in the line-up we will be weak defensively. Gerrard plays in a deep role yet he doesn't have the legs, or frankly the defensive ability to handle games like this.

* To be honest I thought we played quite well and just snatched at a few chances. 

* Balotelli should help with the shot conversion rate, and offer a threat to let Sturridge roam a bit more and provide balls like he did on our goal.

* Emre Can will be a viable option to out muscle mid-table teams and possibly a year European opponent, really like him for the future. 

So next weekend is a major match, we are battling Spurs and United for 4th this year so this is a 6 pointer.

They usually require finicky positioning to get approximately the right temperature, and as they don't normally have thermostats you need to leave the water running long enough to let the hot water reach equilibrium before you stand any chance of setting the temperature. Then when you try to set it, the lever is sticky so that it jumps by half an inch, catapulting the temperature from freezing to scalding, rather than moving smoothly over a wide range to select the temperature you want.

Then of course they usually combine the temperature adjustment with the flow rate so that adjusting one always upsets the other. Why?

Basically they don't work well, and they are aimed at solving a problem that doesn't really exist. If you want to wash your hands, a single tap is fine - cold, or hot if you don't take too long.

true,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"Painful game in the end, especially after what seemed to be such an encouraging start. Disconcerting to see such a collapse in the second half and whilst one can put some blame on Lovren for both the second and third goals, really, few on the pitch had a good game. So, a few thoughts on what happened both on and off the pitch. 

To me, Balotelli is an important signing for us as he is a very unique player in one respect: his unpredictability. This is something he shares with Suarez and it is this part of his game that, I think, is what is going to be very important for us. It is also the part of our game that was missing tonight. 

Our current forwards are all very good players, but defenders know what to expect from each. Sterling has the ball? He is 90% likely to try to dribble past you. Just keep your calm and your feet composed and you can stop him getting through. Sturridge? He will be on your shoulder waiting for that through ball. Don’t give him that space or opportunity to run. Coutinho? Close him down and put pressure on him. Southampton shut him down this way. 

Of course, I am exaggerating a little, but the gist of it sticks, I think. Now, you are a defender and Suarez has the ball. What happens now? Dribble? Maybe. Through ball to someone else? Possibly. Get a touch in and shoot? Yep, he’s done that. Shoot first time? Has happened (we miss you Norwich). Or do something completely out of the Book of Football and write a new chapter, either by doing a completely ridiculous move or, perhaps, French kissing Joey Barton, pooping out a banana and drawing a huge pentagram in the centre circle. 

Whatever it is he chooses to do – you just don’t know what it will be and this makes you nervous. This makes you think that you need more than one man drawing their attention to him. Two men on Suarez? One less man focussing on Sturridge and Sterling, giving them a chance to break. This is what made us so potent last season. You take away that element of surprise away from Liverpool, we remain a very talented and able side, but a solid defence can contain us if they remain organised. We stop being the attacking force of last season and start being Arsenal. 

This, to me, is where Balotelli comes in. He is that sort of player, like Suarez, who makes defenders nervous, as you don’t know what it is he will decide to do. You keep an extra yard away from him. But that gives him space. You close him down? He might get past you. So you put an extra man on him. Freeing the others. If Balotelli repays our faith in him by giving us more of his talent than he gave any of his previous teams, he can have this effect on Premier League defenders and on Liverpool. If he does, we have something very few teams do: we have a laxative for their centre backs. 

Now, onto the other bits of the game. I was surprised Maquillo did not start tonight, considering he had such good games against both Dortmund and Southampton. Perhaps Rodgers did not trust him in a game of this magnitude. But this makes his decision to start Moreno all the more surprising. 

It was Moreno’s first game in a new league. Mistakes happen and he shouldn’t really be blamed for the City goal – clearly he did not expect Jovetic to pounce on the ball like he did. I hope this proved to be a very long-lasting albeit costly lesson to learn.  The responsibility for the goal, if anywhere, lies with Rodgers but, again, he would be damned if he did and damned if he didn’t when it comes to including Moreno in the starting line-up. As it is, the risk didn’t pay off. One wouldn’t expect this sort of mistake in the later stages of the season – for now, the new signings will have to be allowed to bed in. Offensively though, he had a few bright moments. Certainly more than Glen on the other side. 

Markovic: only played 30 minutes but my initial impression is that he is a very bright young gent and, truth be told, I thought his thinking was about two steps ahead of everyone else, including our own players. It seems good things will happen when the rest of our front three catches up with him. 

Jordan Henderson needs a bit more shooting confidence. There were two very good opportunities where he should’ve gone for a first-time shot. Instead, he tried to take a touch and played himself out of a good position. 

Finally, I can’t wait for Lallana to play. I don’t think Joe Allen did much today and I’d rather see Henderson doing his box-to-box thing in his spot and Lallana being our most advanced midfielder. 

Onto better things though! These are all things we can improve and Tottenham should prove to be a different proposition altogether.

true,specofdust,,Abbot. Lots of Abbot.,"Alright you silly cunt, here's what you do:

Take a big chunk of butter, maybe the thickness of your thumb, and chuck that fucker into the biggest pot you have.

Get a kilo of braising steak, or brisket. Chop that shit up into nice cubes, go for a generous centimetre per side. Mix that lush meat in a bowl with some garlic. How much? About half a fucking head unless you're a total grade A cunt. That shit isn't getting chopped, it's getting ninja chopped. I'm taking slices so thin the garlic thinks you're shaving it's god damn pussy. Get that garlic in with that meat in a mixing bowl (A.K.A *A fucking bowl)*. Then add a tablespoon of ground cumin in there, and about 1.5 teaspoons of salt or more if you're an aspiring diabetic like myself. Then I want you to get your chilli powder and chuck that shit at ducks or old people or something then go buy some proper hot fucking chilli powder. Take 4 (FOUR) tablespoons of that shit and mash it in with your meat. Get that all mixed in and just let that meat sit there, feeling the pain your arse is going to the following day, for a living.

Once that's done and the butter is melted down, on a medium heat, add a couple of large, roughly chopped onions and stir those fucks about until they're see through. Do not let them burn. Sodomise yourself with the woodenspoon if you do.

Once those onions and/or sodomy are done, make sure you've got plenty of room in that pot because, surprise surprise, you've still got to cook your fucking meat. Chuck that meaty garlicly spicy mixture you've got in your bowl into the pot and then throw in about 600 ml of water. Why about? Because chilli is man food and exactitude is for fucking pansies, that's why. Replace the water with fucking beer for all I care, it'll be amazing regardless because it's my fucking instruction.

Stir that meat-mix and liquid in until it's all homogeneous, then get that on a high heat. We're not talking the god damn sun here, just a good high heat, and get that meat's boil on. Give it a stir every few minutes you twat, you know you're going to burn the water if you don't. Once you've got a boil in that, take that high heat and make it low heat. Very fucking spot on low. You want a simmer, not a boil, not a nothing, a simmer. Then fuck off and do Brawl things for 20 minutes before coming back to stir. Repeat this step until that sexy pan of mouthgasm has been simmering away for about 3 hours then taste the god damn thing you fool. It's going to taste amazing, but on the off chance that you're actually not a pussy you'll probably want to add more chilli powder and possibly more salt at this stage - you'll almost certainly want about another half tablespoon of cumin. If you do add more, give the chilli at least another 20-30 minutes on the hob simmering away to let the flavour from the powder get inside all the meat.

Don't fuck this up Brawl. If you do this right, people will not know that you're an imposter. In fact, people might even think you're a pro. This is not a complicated recipe I'm giving you, this is not the most interesting one there is, but it's fucking solid chilli.

For bonus points, while at the festival, be sure to refer to anything which has beans in it as stew. Chilli does not contain beans and anyone who thinks it does is a retarded leper.

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"Shit match, but some positives.  
Moreno was refreshing despite his mistake.  


Lambert is great off the bench, and should have taken that shot, but it's a ""new"" club and when Sturridge asked for the ball he put too much pressure on him.  


Markovic will fit in well with the rest of the team, he is explosive, presses well for a flair player and looks for pass rather than trying to take on players and shooting.


Sterling and Coutinho should be as central as possible.


We have a lot of positive influence from bench, which has affect both on the league and CL (unlike people who think depth means just extending starting 11 performance throughout the season).


Lovren and Skrtel aren't designed for high line up (I'm talking about near half line), but they saved us from conceding 3-4 more goals. Last season we would concede 1-2 goals from relegation candidates because we retreated into our box, can you imagine doing it against Dzeko? He was quiet and we got beat on runs through the lines and good passes, it's purely down to lack of tracking back from midfielders than our defenders having shit positioning.


The future looks bright. Lallana would be fucking great in this game combining Allens pressing with danger in front of the goal and creativity. Balo would also be dangerous as he gives us that option Lambert did whole game rather than last 30 minutes. A strong forward like him would allow Sturridge and Sterling to make runs without being double marked. 


For the next game I would love one of Lallana or Balo to start, can't ask for both but one of them should be able to link up well with the team and we would fuck Spurs up. We were able to press and hunt for goal even being down by 3.

We lost to City away last year and there's no shame in losing to the current champions. We actually have a lot of positives to take from this! We dominated the first half an hour, we just lacked firepower, we didn't play that badly, but individual mistakes cost us. Moreno was very good, with the exception of his mistake that led to the goal, that can be blamed on it being his first game, he looked solid at the back and strong going forward. Lovren was good too, a couple of errors of positioning, but improving constantly. Sterling and Coutinho were very good in the first half hour, and city couldn't handle them at all. Markovic was very lively coming on and made a real difference both on the wing and through the middle, he looks very promising!

But we do need to learn from what went wrong. The goals were all caused by errors in defence, and we seemed to have a complete lack in concentration for the third. We also seemed to fall apart after the third as well, which is worrying, but we did then look dangerous after the third, before injuries started hitting us!

All in all, this was a disappointing result, but this is a long season and we're only two games in, we've played good football and we've just made a good signing in Balotelli, heads up everyone!

true,Sleww,lfc68,,"**Pros**:

* Except for a couple missteps, Moreno played very well and showed his best abilities. He's got an actual cross on him. If Brendan can teach him some better positioning, he could be successful here for a long time.

* Markovic was absolutely on fire. Very impressed with his limited minutes.

* Sturridge had a great game in terms of positioning. The problem we had was finding him in those positions.

* Lambert has now positively affected both games in which he's come on and goals have resulted in only a few minutes after his substitution.

* We controlled the pace of the game for quite a bit really.

**Cons**:

* Not a great performance for the midfield. Lost a lot of runners in the defensive half and stalled a lot of attacks. Allen and Hendo did participate in some very useful pressing, but left holes in behind them.

* The entire back line seemed to be either too confident or coached poorly. They went into needless challenges quite often and paid for them far too easily.

* Coutinho just had a bad game. It happens from time to time and Brendan needs to know when to sub him off. He really shouldn't have been on after half time today.

* The City players are just so much more quality than ours at the moment. It makes sense because of the inexperience and youthfulness of our side, but the difference was staggering.

**Other Thoughts**: At the end of the game, only 5 players were on the field that played for us last year. This team is a work in progress. It's tough that we've got a difficult fixture list at the beginning of the season this year, but I'm sure Brendan can improve this side greatly with time.

The biggest problem was probably that we would have had a lot more of them had Johnson not been playing.

Then it comes down to one mistake by a new player who otherwise had a very good debut. Mignolet could perhaps have done better - a world class keeper would have stopped at least one of those.

- City get in between defense and midfield better than any team in the world imo. They showed the frailty in having Gerrard as the shield behind the midfield. There was so much space once he was drawn out of position, and he doesnt have the pace to cover.

Countinho looked like a different player in the pre-season, though I feel he's only as good as the players around him, if Raheem and Studge are making good runs he will find them, if they're having off games then he looks a little ineffective given his poor shot.

Moreno looked good, hopefully such a glaring mistake will be all he needs to come to terms with the speed of the prem. Lovren &amp; Skrtel looked strong again, that 2nd goal was just a great touch by Jovetic, and I thought Migs could have done better on the 3rd.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Overall I thought we played a good game, unfortunately it looks like we still aren't clicking as we should be. Lots of positives though. With Balotelli coming in we can switch back to the 442 diamond that was used for our best moments last year. That should help with the clicking. Sturridge IMO is not a player to lead the line on his own, especially against a team as strong as City (we were without him for this game last season and Suarez struggled - goes to show their defensive strengths) In switching the formation we can also get Couts back in the hole, he is wasted on the wing. Tottenham this weekend will be a 6 pointer (a team we will be competing against for top 4) and we should be stronger for it.

 Second half was looking promising, as a team we were playing well and on another night we would have scored leading to a different game (which would've no doubt brought forward the inevitable cardiac episode this team will give me) I was very happy with the substitutions we made, all 3 players looked hungry. Markovic looks the real deal and he was linking up promising down the left, which at this stage bodes well. Lambert brought in plan B and got us a consolation goal. He looked utterly focussed when the camera panned to him and hopefully, now that he's got a goal (sort of) he can build some momentum and get plenty more. Can looked a bit like Bambi learning to walk with the ball at his feet but he always seemed Tactically adept (tight to his man, reading of the game) and willing to get stuck in. 

Moreno I was very pleased with on his debut, bit of a teething problem for City's first but overall I was very pleased with his performance. Read the game well defensively I thought with his positioning and looked very good going forward. Had one moment where he linked up with Markovic very nicely, hopefully promising for things to come. 

In conclusion, I thought we played very well as a team, 2 of the 3 goals we conceded came from slight errors from new players, which I am confident will be ironed out in due time (Rodger's rollicking I'm sure). It's a cheap approach to take but we haven't dropped any points on last season yet. Let's hope that stays the same against the spuds in a key match on Sunday

However in other parts of the country I feel the traffic police can be really bad in comparison (and in more plentiful supply).

As for driving in the middle lane, I completely understand where you're coming from and this is why the problem subsides. People get angry with middle lane drivers, then act in the exact way that makes people not want to use a lane properly. Personally the best I find this works is when the average traffic speed is around 80. We keep a faster pace and people seem to use lanes properly and it doesn't take too long for spaces to come and go to filter in and out of traffic.

Yeah, it's not right to hate Glen and he's certainly been a great player for the club. However, he does tend to lose the ball in attack and he does tend to stand and watch as the opponent counter-attacks.

He's a good tackler and his positioning defensively is mostly solid. He wouldn't be a bad player for a mid-table PL club. But there's little doubt he's not the quality we need. 

Playing as we do now, with Couthino playing insideforward and Sterling also going into the pitch a lot, we NEED energic fullbacks with high workrate.

We didn't lose this game because of Glen, but he doesn't add much to our offence, and when he tries he often ends up compromising our defensive integrity.

Thus my comment was aimed really at the loud, annoying, brash internet kippers, who are so persistent with their *can't-barrage-the-Farage* narrative. They feel they're on the side for change.

With regards to UKIP's conservatism, I guess I'd agree that they've appealed to many traditionally tory voters (""it was better in the old days"" and ""it's double-dipping to tax inheritance"") but they're also managing to appropriate disillusioned labour voters, too, people who feel shat on by new labour (political correctness and affirmative action) and suspicious of the EU and immigration generally.

That they were screwed over by Thatcher fits the established narrative perfectly up north, yet Labour had a dozen years in which to change things, and they didn't. The whole of Westminster has turned their backs on some areas and communities.

So Farage's soundbites really hit the right note - he talks about ""common sense"" and ""the ordinary working man"". He talks about £50million a day going to Brussels - it doesn't matter that the numbers are wrong, there are still plenty of people who think ""imagine what £50million would do up here"", when the council are cutting back on meals on wheels, or whatever.

My direct reporting accounted for around £5bln, so when say gobsmacked, its should be taken in that context.

My opinion is coloured by this, and it is my view that while I can't say categorically for each and every one, the majority of these councils could make these cuts from their numerous portfolios and not even break sweat. 

The majority of these types of claims are playing politics, and many councils would rather make nurses and firemen unemployed than admit that they can **more than comfortably** make cuts from their own pension pots.

True story: I left the industry a few year ago after the last election. In my local area a group was mobilising to help the community in the midst of all the oppressive cuts being forced upon the intrepid and brave council. I went down and offered my services, and was gladly received. Funnily enough, the council was one of my old clients and while I didn't reveal any specific information, I did suggest some questions which if put forward by the group, could easily sniff out a rat. Needless to say, I never got a call back, and I doubt the questions were ever asked... because I doubt that was ever the point.

true,p_gascoigne,flair3,,"The problem of racist logic is that is not an universal one. Racism is a power system that is always rooted in particular places and events. The way, in particular among American liberals, that race is thought about is reaching a dead end. In this PC view all labels should be left out, and no reason to ask about power relations, what racial labels means etc. ""Best to stay quiet about it!""

A slur is not always slur. It's like white Americans claiming they can be victims of racism too. Which is absurd. As long as there is no underlying power relation giving said slur some purchase: The slur being tossed at you doesn't matter much.

Now to the Yid chant. Except for the lesser fans found around London (Milwall, West Ham and Chelsea), nobody uses Yid aimed at jewish people. It is understood it is a word that was used to negate the effect of xenophobic labels. It is known that the chant is about inclusion, not exclusion. The chant is bascially responding to the xenophobes: ""You know what, we are all Yids"". Rather than the banal comparison with the Redskins, and apt comparison to the U.S. would be if a supporter group of a team in a region with strong anti-Latino sentiment responded by saying: ""You know what, we are all illegals/wetbacks etc"".

Lastly, I wouldn't be surprised if the liberal PC approach to race that you adhere to is in fact the wrong side of history.

It's a little bit different. Creme fraiche is supposed to contain at least about twice as much butter fat than sour creme and that's about it. Although there are many additives used today. 

Cream is an emulsion and when used for cooking it will also both serve as this as well as an emulgator.

There are things about the show under his guidance that I feel aren't in sync with what I personally envision for Doctor Who but he hasn't utterly destroyed the show and from my take on B.B.C. politics has managed to keep the show alive and I'll give him credit for it. He's had Neil Gaiman stories (e.g. Doctor's Wife) so he can't be the horrible showrunner some might feel he is. 

I think there's a lot of projection towards Moffat. I have some of my own towards him but with Capaldi he seems to be righting the ship away from the companion infatuations and focusing more on the Doctor as an alien and not a romantic partner. 
If he brings Gallifrey back and the Time Lords back I'm on board. If he has the Doctor travel back to the prime of Gallifrey when they were at their peek then he gets double praise. If he on-record reverses his comments about the show being about the companions and not the Doctor then he's starting to earn some of my respect.  
In my view, the show has been off trajectory for a bit. While still entertaining I would like Moffat to return focus back on the Doctor, his culture, his people, his planet and the impact of the time lords on the current universe we view each week.

I mean both intros have their drawbacks. I don't think they *needed* to go with either. Only that if these two were the only options I would argue the one I linked works better as a motif.

They've at least touched on the idea that it can move purely through space, even though there is literally no *reason* it needs to. Usually when they show the Time Vortex (at least in the current series) there aren't magical, metaphorically real clock parts flying about in view.

Problem was that Coutinho didn't have enough in front of him and got caught trying to pass the ball sideways in front of the opposition box plenty of times. Markovic came on looking strong because he did what Sterling did for bits earlier in the game; came at the box through the sides. 

Coutinho can't play if there's 2 DMs of the quality Man City has surrounding him; he doesn't have enough people and space in front of him to make incisive passes, he's not a natural dribbler when he's not running, and Fernando and Yaya were never going to let him pass the ball sideways back and forth to Hendo/Allen til they found a break. Markovic (or Lallana) were the better choices for this game, but I don't believe Markovic is ready for 90 minutes and Lallana isn't back yet, so it's what we had. 

I'm not saying this to complain about Coutinho because I think he's fantastic but it wasn't a game where he could do what he knows how to do. Balotelli in for him would've been an option too; if he played behind Sturridge, he's the kind of player that can find long shots and can dribble past opponents even in front of the box (which Coutinho doesn't really do). I think overall we had a VERY positive game. Other things besides not having the right formation for this game that stood out, in terms of negatives: 

1. Johnson is awful. He wasn't at fault for the goals or anything, but he's not good at anything anymore. He can't attack OR defend.

I haven't down (or up) voted you, but your ""votes at 16 is an under-hand tactic"" argument is incorrect.

Lowering the voting age to 16 has been a long-standing SNP (and Plaid Cymru, and Lib Dem) policy - it's unconnected to the referendum.

The origin of it is simply that the [Age of Legal Capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Legal_Capacity_(Scotland\)_Act_1991) is 16 in Scotland, not 18 as it is in the rest of the UK.

If you wanna be near the city centre and such for not too much money, Edgbaston, Selly Oak, Jewellery Quarter are probably good places to look. Edgbaston is within walking distance to the city centre and has lots of student house shares and such. It has dodgy areas but also some nice areas. Selly Oak is also very studenty. Slightly further out but still close enough to the city centre, although It'd be a longer walk to the city centre. It is also on the cross city train line which runs every 10 minutes until late at night. Again, it can be a bit dodgy in places but nothing you wouldn't expect from a student area and there are some nicer areas too. Jewellery Quarter is within walking distance of the city centre and is very lively with plenty of nightlife. Again, it's close to the city centre so can be dodgy but nothing you wouldn't expect of a major city.

Another option to look at might be Digbeth. It's an up and coming area within 5 - 10 minutes walk from the city centre. It's got plenty going on but still a bit rough so fairly cheap. I personally wouldn't want to live there but it's not awful.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"I'm honestly more positive about the side today than I was this time last week. We got three points against Southampton, but the performance was decidedly flat, and we made Southampton look impressive. I'll admit was a bit worried that we weren't going to carry the promise we showed pre-season into competitive games and it might take too long for us to really get going.

For the first half today I thought we were comfortably on top. They created maybe one half-chance for the first 40 minutes, whilst we had some really good periods of sustained pressure and keeping them stuck in their own half. Then we gifted them a goal and kind of went to shit after that for a bit. But for the rest of the season and for the Champions League in particular, I think the fact that we had the current league champions pinned back at their own ground is a good sign. And if Lambert had finished the great chance he had to make it 3-2 I really think we could have somehow snatched a draw from that game.

Add onto that for new signings Moreno looked pretty good aside from one mistake, Lovren played well again, Lambert showed he can cause trouble coming on later into the game, and Markovic gave them a solid ten minute spell where they just couldn't handle him. Honestly think that with time to gel we've got a squad that should be odds-on for a top four finish this season. Plus there's still the likes of Lallana and Balotelli to slot into the side.

Statistically I wouldn't really have expected us to take more than a point from the game today. One point dropped is far from the end of the world. In terms of final result it's obviously not as good as last weekend, but I felt our standard of performance overall was far more promising.

Suddenly, the Doctor and Rose were both horrifyingly twisted space-time events that needed to be righted, even if it meant cutting them both out of the timeline. It even broke the TARDIS!

It's probably a lot to do with a human, who lacks the innate understanding of the flow of time, playing with Timelord technology, which allows far greater manipulations of the timeline than any other known form of temporal technology. The Doctor can go back and even act on impulse when crossing his own timeline because he understands intuitively how it works.

As an example of the way that Timelord tech can circumvent normal time-travel limitations; TARDIS travel somehow negates the 'time differential effect', through which sparks of potential time energy can violently move from one object to another instance of it at another point in its timeline. The problem is apparent for objects which have traveled by way of Vortex Manipulator (such as 11's screwdriver in *Big Bang*).

The problem is probably dramatically exaggerated by the fact that Rose is the Bad Wolf- a character who dramatically influences the Doctor's past...

After considering this point for some time I've come to a conclusion. First, I think education is good here but the quality of schools can vary quite drastically.

I've heard this complaint from various eastern europeans, and the statistics don't back their claims that schools in those countries are better. This is my theory anyway.

That's actually quite a hard market to play in, at least in the UK. A lot of people seem to think the treatment from private care is better. I would disagree with this myself. The main thing people are paying for when going private is to ""jump the queue"" of the NHS waiting lists and have the convenience of having treatment done on their schedule and not on whatever the NHS can offer (i.e. not having to structure their lives around available care, but scheduling the care around their lives).

The specialists I've worked with offer the same standard of care and treatment options regardless of the patient being on the NHS or being private. The main difference is the person being able to have that appointment or operation this month, in a hospital with cable TV and newspaper delivered to your bedside and not in 10 months time in a hospital that has no available parking and food that I wouldn't feed to a rat.

The NHS is, for the most part, excellent. It is also oversubscribed and additionally weighed down by the costs of drunks and an obesity epidemic. Private care isn't any better from a clinical standpoint, its just a way of getting treatment on your schedule, in nicer facilities, without having to listen to a family of chavs argue in the berth next to you.

Not to be a massive hipster but I had the same thought around graduation (and many times since having worked with graduates - in theory educated young people - who have *no* idea what they're doing when it comes to even writing a CV or speaking to other people in a professional manner): 

Why do Universities not teach this? 

Hell why don't colleges teach this? 

I was on a train earlier today and spent the hour or so trip chatting to a girl who works helping people to get back into employment by polishing up their life skills. She was telling me that there were even plenty of adults who struggled with basic CV writing etc. in their 40's (plus). 

It's kind of shocking when you think about it. Ideally after education we should be ready to handle at least the basics of what life is going to throw at us and it's going to throw these things (writing a CV, registering at a doctors or dentists (and why this is important) etc.) equally and universally. We're *all* going to need it at some point 99.999 times out of 100. 

So - yes - I entirely agree.

true,calw,eng-Oxfordshire,Oxford,"A lot of the time the way that Salmond spoke today was not based on reasoning and debate but more based on trying to win rhetorically. 

For example with the currency issues Salmond and a loud share of the crowd seemed to think that it was a great victory that Darling 'admitted' that Scotland could use sterling without the rest of the UK's consent. However no one denies that they could, it would just be a terrible idea for Scotland because they would have no control over their own monetary policy, so for example if inflation is low in the rest of the UK and high in Scotland and there is no formal currency arrangement the BoE would take measures, using primarily interest rates and quantitative easing to raise inflation and this could be disastrous for Scotland. Furthermore, despite the recent high profile backing of the idea by prominent economists, I didn't quite understand his point that Scotland would accept a share of public debt if there was no currency union, one seems to be a fiscal issue and the other a monetary one but I'm not a lawyer nor a politician so I can't say he's wrong but he didn't do enough to make him trust him. Darling's point about the amount of dependance on Westminster that a currency union would entail I think was important, even if it wasn't emphasised by either side tonight. 

Regarding oil, Darling mentioned how it was volatile and perhaps risky to rely so heavily on it, and Salmond just said there was a lot it and that Darling's worries meant that he didn't view it as an asset. 

Salmond won the NHS debate in my view, however I think if Darling stressed more heavily how NHS success is much more easily obtained with a good economy then perhaps he could have won if he had successfully argued that the economy is healthier together. However that's a big burden in itself, albeit one that I'd lean towards agreeing with. 

The trident debate was interesting, I think that Salmond saying that it might not be relocated has some truth to it but it was fairly weak, also I think I was more convinced of Darling's promise of jobs in the area. 

Ultimately I think Darling's point that a lot of 'The Yes' campaign's promises relied on a trust that the negotiations would go their way was the most important thing for me. I'm not sure I could risk so much with the current faith I have in some of the SNPs promises.

However, I have seen surreptitious clues that the end is nigh for Imperial.

By your estimation, if all white people starting saying, ""no, it's cool, we're all niggers, mah nigga"" that would, by definition, be inclusionary and thus not racist.  But that's on its face, ridiculous.  No one would defend that stance.  So, all we're really arguing about is the level at which a slur word crosses that definition.

Now ""yid"" isn't ""nigger"" - there's not so much angst around the word.  So we could assign in a value where nigger is worth 100 points of offensiveness.  Let's assess ""yid"" or ""redskin"" or ""wetback"" etc.  Where is the dividing line where it's cool for a non-member to use the slur?  20?  40?  60?

This is (reduced somewhat absurdly for illustrative purposes) your argument: some words, while still being widely recognized as a slur, are not actually slurs because some non-members have attached ""special circumstantial meaning"" to it or ""are not offensive enough by some unknowable scale.""  

This is pretty much a variant of ""Redskins"" (albeit less terrible).  If you are not Jewish, you don't get to say if it's a slur or not.  And even if it is endorsed by some Jewish people, it certainly is not endorsed by them all.

And finally, if we assign any social value to the historicity of hooliganism from which the ""Yid"" chant is sprung, we can fairly agree that, at least in England, the hooligan era is over.

Things you will need for this week's hobby:

1 large red onion     
Some garlic    
500g of mince    
A tin of baked beans    
A tin of kidney beans,  I normally get the ones in chilli sauce    
A pack of black beans    
A pack of chorizo    
A bottle of wine     
Shitloads of spices and stuff    

Pour yourself a glass of wine

Finely chop the onion and garlic and whack it in a pot with some hot oil in it. Add some chilli powder and paprika at this point as well. 

After a little bit (don't overdo it) add the mince and cook it all up until the mince is just browned. 

Add all the beans,  I normally pour a little of the baked bean sauce away so it's not too sweet. 

Add some wine so stuff doesn't burn to the bottom. 

Cut the chorizo finely and add it. 

Add a load of paprika, chilli power, cumin whatever really hot spices. Actual chillis if you have them. 

Salt to taste, salt can take away the throat burning chilli and make it a full mouth thing. 

Let it simmer for as long as you like, add wine if it gets too unfluidy or if it gets too winey I have used passata in the past. Probably just water wouldn't be bad. 

Serve with rice or doritos.

Nothing stops your NHS doctor making a private prescription for you. You'd probably have to pay retail prices for those items which aren't available on the NHS (i.e. not the basic £8.50 prescription charge), but its an option. That said, its pretty rare for something to be unavailable on the NHS without good reason. Prescribing guidelines and alternatives normally keep costs in check and there are exception processes for things not generally available. 

A doctor might charge you a fee for a private prescription (I have no idea what the going rate for this is - a private appointment is about £150-£200 for 30 mins), I would guess it would be about £30 for a private prescription, but ask your local GP for their rates to get an idea.

His alternatives are spending 3/4 of it on a mix of petrol and London parking fees (with the latter constituting a greater share) or getting a better paid job, a couple of housemates and living in London.

The suppression of African Americans in the U.S. is based  skin color. A white person, regardless of background/wealth/class cannot be called ""nigger"" with any effect. The inherent logic of American racism makes it impossible for ""nigger"" to be an effective slur against white people (or anybody else that does not have dark skin). Correspondingly, ""nigger"" as a re-appropriated word can only be used by people that has this particular skin color. Anything else would be absurd.

Migration and/or being Jewish on the other hand are social categories. You can't see the migrant on someone, just like you can't tell whether someone is Jewish or not based on they physical characteristics. So what happens in areas with lots of migration is that all people, regardless of nationality, become undocumented/aliens/illegals/job stealers etc...or in the vernacular of the early 20th century in London: Yids.

EDIT: Hooliganism has lost most of its presence, but it still around. But, importantly, xenophobia and nationalism is on the rise in the UK. And nationalism in the UK is based on an idea that Brits are white, christian, and speak English. So I certainly do believe there is still much football fans can do to support inclusion, diversity, and acceptance.

EDIT II: It's not small-mindedness/tradition. It is the fans celebrating a history of inclusion. When the club was painted as something most English people at the time saw as something bad, namely being Jewish. The club's fans responded by embracing the Jewish community rather than rejecting it.

EDIT III: Sorry about all the edits, but there are just so many holes in your argument. ""Nigger"" along with black, negro etc. was a category that was purely constructed to enslave and take rights away from people.

true,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"That's fair enough - it is something I cannot prove or disprove. But it is my feeling that it does play a part. To me, the idea of having to pay money in order to receive better education seems ludicrous. As you say, there are both good and bad state schools, that's not the issue. But I do think the moment you introduce monetisation in an education system, you apply a plaster to the problem as opposed to a solution. 

People who can afford it will and do pay for their kids to go to better schools. Unfortunately, it is these same people who are often in a better position to influence political discourse in this country. The effect of that is that the reform of education inequality is not as pressing an issue as it would have been, had these same people not had the opportunity to 'throw money at the problem' and had a direct vested interest in ensuring a level playing field for all kids. 

If you look at Scandinavia or Central Europe (at least from my personal experience and the people I met there), there almost seems to be a social stigma attached to one's children attending a private school in that it implies they are not clever enough to make do with the otherwise quality state education system. 

Here it feels like it's a bit of the opposite, where people on my university course who have come from state schools were seen as somewhat of an oddity and a deviation from the norm. Nevertheless, that was a very particular environment, I admit. Still, even in my professional life, none of the people I work with have their children in state schools bar one (where her daughter's state school outranks the private ones in the area). 

To me it seems like a strange way to do it. I feel the continental Europeans have it the better way around, as it ensures that real talent is what decides one's academic progress and this is not influenced by the personal wealth or place of residence of one's parents.

-  Coutinho had below average match, he shrank and disappeared gradually through the game, whilst he was our best attacking midfielder in the pre-season. He didn't offer much and out muscled by City's midfielders defence, the moment he was replaced with Lazar our offence improved. 

- Hendo at times seemed lost, in *arguably* our best chances tonight he was slow.


- All City's goals came from individual mistakes, two from our side backs, the first Moreno failed to clear (or at least protect) the ball, the second Glen chose to protect the goal instead of covering Jovetic. The third was Lovren's who ran ahead of Agüero, instead of letting him caught offside.

- We could have done more damage on the frontlines if we deployed two forwards from the start, also we could have been more challenging if we started with physically stronger player(s) like Can.

true,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"The Irish did not use the British pound, they used the Irish Pound, which was a different currency. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_pound 

The Scots *could* use the British pound after independence but they would have lost input on monetary policy, which means stuff like interest rate controls and liquidity controls would be deployed in the interests of the English, Welsh and Northern Irish economies only. 


The SNP economic plan involves cutting corporation tax and wealth taxes in Scotland to undercut England's tax regime so there's not really any incentive for the Bank of England to bend over backwards to make things easy for them.  If they choose independence they'll be a competing economy and would rightfully be treated as such.  

If the Scottish and English economies were to travel along parallel trajectories Scotland could probably use the £ without hassle, however if future Scottish governments wish to rely heavily on oil exports to fund public services etc (as the SNP has clearly indicated) than you have the prospect of Scotland being a predominately exporting economy with England remaining as a predominately importing economy, which would mean England would want a stronger £ and being in charge would be able to control that. 

You also have the prospect of Scotland turning in to a petro-economy, heavily reliant on stable fuel prices. Other petro-economies can offset fluctuations through currency manipulation, but no currency control means this isn't an option. 

Honestly, I don't get why any Scottish person would think keeping the £ and having less control is a good idea for Scotland. It makes me think Alex Salmond is secretly English and it's all an evil ploy to ruin the Scottish economy. The Euro isn't much better; the Irish economy is just about growing this year but that's because it started from such a low base and has been benefiting from exporting to a growing UK economy.  

In the long run if economic independence is going to work they'll need a new currency, keeping the £ or adopting the Euro will just mean a political and economic union with either England or the EU, which is shared sovereignty, not independence. If that's what the SNP wants fine, but they should call a digging implement a digging implement and they shouldn't beat around the bush in explaining the pitfalls to voters.

Privately it costs me about £50 for a check-up (I do twice a year) and about the same for a hygiene treatment which I do once a year. Insurance covers this anyway. I think I pay about £15/month overall for dental cover which covers the cost of check-ups / hygine treatment and the lions share of any work that needs doing.

true,MrNorbertHubitch,null,null,"Nothing to panic about. We started very brightly and we were the better team until the defensive lapse that led to their first goal. Even before their opener I felt we looked a little stunted in front of goal and we needed to be a bit more incisive to open them up. Had we kept it tight at the back then having the extra options of Lambert and Markovic is perfect for games like that, were it's apparent that trying to open them up through the middle is going to lead to little joy.

Shame about the first goal and especially the timing of it. Felt bad for Moreno but it's just one of those things, he recovered well though and never let his head drop and ended up having a fine game. There were one or two moments in the later stages of the game when he linked up very well with Markovic, which is certainly promising. 

I have to admit to having a few doubts over Mignolet and again he was could've done better with at least two of the City goals. I'm not sure why Sakho isn't starting either. I don't know if it would have made a huge difference today, but for me he's our best defender and I'd much prefer to see him lining up alongside Lovren than Skrtel. 

Disappointed but let's not get too downhearted just yet. We were playing the best team in the league away from home and perhaps this fixture was just a little too early for us. There's plenty of time to iron out our deficiencies and there's also a fair few positives to take out of the game, such as the performances of Moreno, Markovic and Joe Allen. Sterling too for that matter. He's continuing his rapid development and well on the way to becoming one of our most important players.

It implies that a country can't be 'fully' independent as a member of the EU.

&gt;Salmond's argument is the one that talks down the EU, suggesting people outside of Scotland aren't capable of making laws Scotland must abide by.

That's not Salmond's argument at all.

&gt;All your laws don't come from Westminster, but Salmond feels that the people debating and legislating them aren't qualified to based on their country of origin not being Scotland.

Eh? You're the one who brought up laws here. As far as I'm aware, Salmond has made no such argument.

&gt;If you felt that not having a positive vision of the UK was bad for the No camp, you wouldn't mind them not having one.

I do think it's bad for the No camp. I'm not set to Yes by default, I've just been utterly unconvinced by Better Together.

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"Yeah, if it was only Dzeko it's one thing, but there are 2 player behind, there are times to push up (when the ball is deep in the other half or one player is trying to take the defense further from midfield) but here they should be dropping back, just like with Aguero goal. Think Neuer as great defensive line except for the last part when he enters the box. If the ball is being passes around in the opponents box by our players, stay at midfield, if the ball comes to their mid half, drop a bit deeper as our players also drop deeper, but if the ball is in our half don't try to create high line for them to pass into and Aguero to run in to. Make the distance between defense and keeper a priority when it's in our half (except our box), while when it's in theirs make the distance between our defense and midfield the priority.


Here 2 players want to close down space so that City doesn't move into it, while 2 are trying to retrieve the ball (Lovren) and close space further up (moreno). Let Moreno close Zabba (his mark), Lovren space, and GJ and Skrtel mark Dzeko and close space around him.


It was pretty shit defensive work, like Sturridge making diagonal runs while Coutinho fails at dribbling and Sterling keeps passing to defenders for a comparison of how bad this is if it was our attack. The priority should be to close down space regardless of presence, but closing down players who expose space, it's a mix of zonal marking and man marking with the former being first priority. But Skrtel will always prioritize Zonal while it looks like Lovren prioritizes man marking, the question is which one can adapt first as Sakho is good at both (lacks direction/ decision making). Lovren is good but based on this post you would think he was world class and Skrtel shit. The guy needs to develop or we wouldn't have been the only ones in for him, he does provide one excellent quality in closing down the players, and pushing our defense line up to close space, but he isn't complete.",0,1409009633,null,0,false,0,ck0f3my,t3_2ekkwm,t1_ck0f3my,t1_ck0eab3,null,1427359855,13,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,13

true,Lailah20,null,null,"Hello Michal :) Fellow Polish here, but with a much longer ""residency"" in the UK (9 years and counting...). I could add a couple of things to your list, get rid of few, but it is surprising that they are pretty much similar. 

1. Banks - I fully agree with those. It used to drive me mad, but since everything can be done online, I simply stopped thinking about it.

2. I am a freelancer and work at home. Well OK, anywhere where the Internet is, which is almost everywhere. When I worked at school (6 years - high school and colleges) sick people did not come to teach, because that meant spreading the diseases, so I guess it depends.

3. Tea with milk - god, no. Salt and vinegar crisps and chips - hell yeah. I sort of got ""infected"" with them by my son. His fault. Yes, I do like them.

4. Weather! It might be crazy but I love English weather - warm summers and mild winters. I never want to go back to snow (up to -30 in winter in Poland!) and scorching sun (+40 in summer!). 15-20 degrees is perfect.

5. Parking and driving in general - It is shockingly easy to drive here (parking - well, if you are confident). I drove left-hand drive vehicle for 7 years and I have never had any issues with driving, parking or the police. People are generally kind, calm and you never have issues to join the traffic.

6. Customer service - sorry, but it is simply incomparable with Polish one. I spent a week in July in Poland. Not a single person smiled, looked in the eyes or made me feel welcome in any shop whatsoever.

7. Education - again, it depends where you ""land"". I am a qualified teacher/lecturer and I have been working in education here for 9 years, so I could write a book about it. I also have a son who finished primary school and just started high school, so I guess I know a lot about every key stage. It is a completely different world - it has advantages and disadvantages. If a parent bothers to find a good school and makes a serious effort in the child's education, then it beats Polish education by a mile. In fact, it was one of the most important factors of my arrival to UK - to be able to send my son to school here. Ofsted reports will give some basic indication of the school's quality, it is possible to see most schools in action, talk to students and parents. OK, I'll stop here :)

8. I can't praise the paramedics/health care and police enough. Those few occasions that I had to use the services were shockingly positive. The staff was always polite, professional and supportive. I was never once ""sent away with paracetamol"" or ignored by the police. It was just the opposite. Yes, I am well aware NHS is a bureaucratic mess. I sometimes do projects for them.

9. Transport - buses - in my area are terrible -pricey and rare. Trains - by far my favourite mode of transport but so terribly expensive. I love travelling by trains! Especially to London!

10. Self-employment. Oh. Yes, no paperwork. No visits to the offices. No dealing with incompetent workers. Oh, no one is trying to destroy my company with constant inspections, taxes, forms, fees and whole load of Polish crap. In fact, it is just the opposite. I am being offered help at any time to deal with the tax man properly and efficiently. This is beyond comparison with Polish reality.

I will be getting my British passport at some point this year and at the moment, despite quite a few bits that drive me mad (insurance companies!), I would not change this place for anything else in the world. I have a fantastic career, own house, friends and family here. This is my place too :)

One year I had an attendance rate of 55%, and yet I was still credited as a hard working student for placing in the top three percent. I did the very bare minimal, just quickly, on time, with a well learned syllabus. Saying that, when I missed exam days, I would take them when I came in, in another classroom. Which class? The lowest graded children. Having sat through three classes of 30+ children being taught shapes and dimensions in year 11 was mind-boggling. They were taught to achieve C's, being drilled the same information for hours and hours. 

On the other hand, adults are constantly telling us how easy we have it today compared to them. How our exams are easy, how easy it is to find a job, we're just lazy. Radio stations for call-in critics telling us how much harder O-levels were, stories of studies where teens fail old O-level test papers. 

At the end of the day, we're teaching kids to study and pursue their own interests, but that doesn't guarantee employment. I can tell you all about old English authors, of renaissance scientists, the rise and fall of empires, and religions... but changing a light fitting? I'd have to find a youtube video. Drain a radiator? Youtube. 

School teaches you a little of everything, and then encourages you to specialize, leaving with a narrow set of skills, and a wide birth of inapplicable knowledge that you'll never, ever require.

true,Isogash,null,null,"I think the lack of self-improvement is a HUGE issue in education though, up until GCSE's at least. Kids don't see school as training, but just as something they have to do until they (don't) get a job. It would be incredibly hard to change this perspective since it is so ingrained into modern British culture. Maybe we have kid's TV and the media to blame for this?

Also, the government knows bugger all about education. We would be so much better off with educational decisions made by the schools and teachers, and not some completely unqualified, out-dated, posh wankers. For reference, Michael Gove's education policies received ""a vote of no confidence"" from basically all major teaching unions. One of these was unanimous with all members.

The school environment is also crap now, probably as a direct result of the removal of teacher planning time in school (until recently, teacher's had to be given a certain amount of time in school to plan lessons/mark books). I finished AS last summer with 3 A's (Maths, Further Maths, Computing) and 2 B's (Physics, Music). During my entire school life, I've almost never bothered with homework. Sure, I did the important/interesting bits, but I will almost always refuse to do a sheet of repetitive maths questions unless there is a really good reason for it (I'm a fast learner, so I find it completely unnecessary). I left after a month of A2's because teachers were bad-mouthing me to other kids while I was in the room. Abusive teachers are becoming more and more common, and the line between banter and bullying is very thin.

My mother can also testify that recent education changes were absolute shite. She is a secondary school maths teacher. Whilst teaching may look like a cushy, high paid job with lots of holidays, I can assure you it is anything but. Firstly, most people don't realise, but planning a one hour lesson takes up to an hours or m~~~~ore. You need to plan every minute, find or create resources and print them (using your own printer because the government is also cheap). She also has to provide proof that she planned it, in case Ofsted come knocking. So, 7 hour school day (has to arrive early) with 5 hour-long lessons requiring 5 hours of planning beforehand (thanks to the new changes she has to teach mostly 5 lessons a day) and at least another 5 hours of marking homework each night. So, 75 hours a week (normal work week is 40). Her salary is quite comparable to a graduate software engineer by the way, despite her having a 2-1 degree in Maths and doing proper teacher training to become fully qualified.

No wonder all of my maths lessons were questions from a textbook.

Maths is a complete joke. You know what sorts of questions will be asked before you go into the exam, you know how to answer them. Congratulations.

Sciences use a lot of the same questions but the context is changed around a lot. The main concern here is working out what it is that you're being asked, then applying the basic knowledge to these. These exams are by far the hardest to get right and they punish mistakes heavily (misunderstanding the original context can lose you up to 12 marks). 

English lit. We are told to use the text to support analysis about the writer's intentions with a passage. An example of what has to be done

- In Djekyll and Hyde, the use of 'stampeding' to describe Hyde portrays Hyde's character as being similar to an animal.

This seems useful in its concept, but going into an exam, the marker will have generally have a checklist of correct analysis points that need to be made. Making up your own relevant and correct analysis doesn't matter if you don't regurgitate the important analysis your teacher would have had to have focused on.

Other subjects: Humanities are a huge amount of fact regurgitation.

Languages are done over the course of the year as a series of speaking tests, writing pre-prepared passages and then a horrible Reading and Listening exam. The tape plays through twice (split up into small chunks) for the Listening and you have to answer through a booklet full of trick questions (e.g. Where did Tim go, after hearing - Tim avoided the mall because ...,  he enjoys the beach and was planning to go there after visiting his friend until his phone went off). Misinterpreting one or two things can send you down completely the wrong path.  

I did the first year of A levels this year (AS). Maths is still a memorizing joke but with some level of working out what you have to do on the final couple of questions. Physics is very much based around being given a scenario you won't have encountered and dealing with it. English is much more free in analysis but everything must be very relevant and tight-knit.

However Darling froze up when asked how they would tackle poverty in Scotland and Salmond has made plenty of noise about that.

Salmond did answer the currency question although clearly favoured a currency union. Whether one is possible or not is another thing entirely. With that said he did say directly that without it Scotland will (at first I assume) peg itself to the pound.

true,AluminumFalcon3,lfc12,,"Disagree. While I would like to see how we do without him, I think Gerrard gives our side much more than he takes away. The first is leadership and experience--it goes without saying that Gerrard is a fantastic captain in terms of spirit and organization who has stepped up time and time in so many different scenarios to lead is to victory. Look at him last season after the City game--he was an incredible leader in our 11 game streak. 

The second is distribution and passing ability. Gerrard not only has the ability to pull off some fantastic passes, he also has confidence to try the harder ball when necessary. He provides us with a much better passing range, passes on the counter, passes to switch play quickly, and in general is comfortable at back dropping between CBs. 

I'm going to give assists and set pieces their own section here because he contributes so much with them. We were a huge threat at set plays last year, which helped us immensely, and that was largely thanks to Gerrard's deliveries. 

Finally he can and has slotted home penalties with confidence under pressure. That in itself is huge, though obviously on its own not a reason to justify a player's selection. 

Yes Gerrard is not a mobile defender, which means he has a hard time dealing with midfielders and attackers with good movement. But I think he is an exceptional asset to the club and is definitely part of our strongest XI over Can or Allen or anyone else in that holding role.

A more effective use of resources would have been to let the strengths of our core players dictate the shape of our formation.  Then we could have used the transfer window to add depth in those positions.  You see, we have players like Phillips, Hoilett, Simpson, the guys who got us where we are.  Simpson, a consistent defender through and through last season, who even managed some quality crosses in the attacking third.  Hoilett, we literally would not be promoted without him.  Won the penalty in the semi-final, and assisted the winner at Wembley.  These guys in my mind are Premier League quality.  They have shown they will fight for the club and put in a shift.  We all know the saying, hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.  As cliche as it is, it is true and I would rather see the guys who got us to the Prem be given a real go.  Even if they struggle more so than some of our new signings, it is the feeling of seeing a player fight for their club that bestows pride. It is difficult to see how they fit into this ""new"" formation?  Personally, I would be gutted if my club replaced me after a season of hard work and determination.

What would be simple, if they're desperate to have sanctions, is to issue the sanction, but don't stop the money, informing the claimant, who can then appeal with their side of things, which then goes to an independent body, to throw out stupid bullshit like 'had a job interview that clashed, informed them 3 times and they said it was fine, then got sanctioned for not attending the Jobcentre in the middle of my job interview.'  

If they then uphold it, consider a partial sanction instead of stripping all support away, and no sanctions for people with mental or physical health issues, as it's the system's fault they're parked on JSA anyway, to save thirty quid a week ... which is then lost by the NHS treating people who can't deal with the increased stress and anxiety.",0,1409011902,null,0,1409012327,0,ck0g5zp,t3_2ekj6x,t1_ck0g5zp,t3_2ekj6x,null,1427359358,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

- First goal 3 defenders are standing close to Dzeko. Instead Lovren should have tried to reduce the gap between him and Moreno. And Gerrard also did not cover Silva well.

- Second goal, no one is covering spaces well.

- Third goal, the gap between Moreno and Lovren should not have been that high. Either Gerrard should have been there or Lovren should have moved as Neville says. Its a very easy for Navas to make the pass when  he knows Aguero will defeat Lovren for pace.


I am really worried about Gerrard being the defensive midfielder with attacking full backs. He does not anticipate and cover spaces well. Lucas is better at that, but he lacks the dynamism and creativity. We will need to work more hard on training field to defend the spaces better. Other wise teams like City who are good at finding those spaces between lines will score goals against us. 

We should not worried much too, most of the other teams in league are not as good as City in finding those spaces and exploiting them. ",0,1409011904,null,0,false,0,ck0g60w,t3_2ekndz,t1_ck0g60w,t1_ck0f9w4,null,1427359358,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11

Lets not forget though that although Darling didn't have that answer, Salmond still didn't say what option he is going for as his plan B... he just listed several options that Scotland could follow on independence without a currency union.

He also had no answer as to how Scotland would deal with £5 billion budget deficit Scotland would have once Independent instead trying pointing the finger at Darling for running up a deficit bailing out the banks. 

If I were a Scot I would be worried as to why Salmond has no plan for dealing with a £5 billion deficit especially since borrowing it by issuing bonds would be pretty difficult for any new country without very high interest rates and even then without even knowing what currency your going to issue those bonds in. Salmonds currency plan B option list (all 3) all lead to alot of monetary control still being in the hands of the bank of England, which at this point (if the yes vote wins) would mean if Scotland gets in trouble financially (which it will eventually, or possibly if  sooner if they can't fill the immediate deficit) they can't devalue their currency if you don't get a new one and create a new central bank of their own.

&gt; ""A private system will always, after being given time to equilibrate, prove to be the most efficient and effective system"" 

This is simply untrue. It may be more frequently successful depending on the market, but its simply not guaranteed. Monopolies form in unchecked private markets and even with regulation you have regulatory capture to worry about. 

America's healthcare system is a pretty damning indictment of that argument alone. They pay more (&gt;7% more per capita) for worse clinical outcomes. That is neither efficient nor effective by any measure a patient would benefit from.

Healthcare is a very dodgy example too as it typically suffers from a huge [information asymmetry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_asymmetry) between patient and care provider. Additionally, healthcare generally has huge externalities applicable to it (the whole reason [why we vaccinate people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality#Positive)). 

&gt;  This is why huge waiting lists exist in the NHS; because we are terrible at allocating time , manpower and resources. 

First, most of the waiting lists aren't huge - clinical need jumps people too. Second, they vary from hospital to hospital and from trust to trust. Third, this problem is common in private sectors too. It's not the case that there is always a flight from the airport you want, at the time you want, going to the destination you want, at a price you can afford. You have to work around what the market offers. There are barriers to entry to all industries and 
 the private sector can be as bad as the public sector, especially when you operate at the scale the NHS does.

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

Both link up well, and their passing percentage is about the same.  Kane doesn't play quick flicks as often as Soldado, but he sure can weight a through ball or a cross every bit as well as Soldado can.   And right now, Kane is doing a better job of scoring goals and setting up goals.

Since last August:

* Kane has 7 starts and 10 sub appearances, and in that time he has 3 non-penalty goals and 3 assists.

In terms of who's in better form right now and adds more to the team, how is it not Kane?  (Yeah, yeah, Soldado-Lamela bromance ... Kane and Lamela have also played well together.)

Election is held, where the scottish MPs are no longer a problem to Cameron and where he can claim he has supported the UK people (by getting a good deal). Economy is doing better, and UKIP can be bought off - meaning his chances of winning are high.

Assuming he can get back in under this (and I'm betting that he plays up the EU vote - ""the only way you will get a say this decade"") he then waits for scotland to collapse under the weight of it's own folly (and his mates in the City); and then says (or more probably has already said in the terms of independence) these are the revised terms for us taking you back and bailing you out.

&gt;The __*Chesapeake*–*Leopard* Affair__ was a naval engagement that occurred off the coast of [Norfolk, Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk,_Virginia), on 22 June 1807, between the British warship [HMS *Leopard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Leopard_(1790\)) and American [frigate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigate) [USS *Chesapeake*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Chesapeake_(1799\)), when the crew of the *Leopard* pursued, attacked and boarded the American frigate looking for deserters from the [Royal Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy).  The *Chesapeake* was caught unprepared and after a short battle involving broadsides from the *Leopard*, her commander, [James Barron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Barron), surrendered his vessel to the British after firing only one shot. Four crew members were removed from the American vessel and were tried for desertion, one of whom was subsequently hanged. The *Chesapeake* was allowed to return home where James Barron was [court martialed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_martial) and suspended from command.

Yes the organization of the midfield in the picture is a mess, and what I'm trying to say is that if all four defenders had kept a straight line at the back (preferebly a high one) that would give our midfielders an easier time covering the right spaces. The reason I'm targeting Skrtel and Johnson is because Johnson is generally just terrible at positioning himself defencively and Skrtel plays better in a deep line where he don't have to worry about the space behind him. Skrtel in particular has a tendency to drag the defence too far behind, leaving more space for city to take advantage with their exellent link-up play.",0,1409013930,null,0,false,0,ck0h4c0,t3_2ekndz,t1_ck0h4c0,t1_ck0fyfd,null,1427358843,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

Honestly, I'd love to see Gerrard play CAM for 45 minutes, then sub him for Coutinho if needed.  He's still, in my opinion, the best attacking midfielder in our side, he just can't do it for 90 every game and don't expect him to spend a lot of time tracking back.

true,higgins091,,Guzan will save us!,"- Cissokho is current my signing of the summer. He is currently head and shoulders over any LB that we have had for the past 5 years. Finally we have a LB that is as good defensively as he is offensively.

- Despite the decent start, there is still a great deal of uncertainty around the club. Sacking Paul Lambert and replacing him will Roy Keane is a bit like Sunderland replacing MON with Paulo Di Canio. Keane is a live grenade and while he brings a lot to the table as an assistant, i suspect bringing him in as manager will end the same way as Paolo Di Canio did. It's started out as a good partnership but that's as far as it should go. If Paul Lambert were to be sacked, Roy Keane should be nothing more than a stop gap solution. Short of us losing 5-0 to WBA, Lambert should remain manager as i can pretty much guarantee that in our situation as an ownerless relegation candidate, there is no better manager that would even consider managing us. I think Lambert will prove to be the right man for the job this season. He finally has a balanced team and Roy Keane will bring the best out of us. The partnership will flourish as it is and we should give it time to grow.

- To be honest, survival should be our only aim. With the summer we have just had (Club put up for sale, no CEO, No transfer funds) many were tipping us to go down. We have had a good start put that shouldnt change things too much. Last season we won on opening day at Arsenal and as great as that was, it became a double edged sword as it raised our expectations to a largely unreasonable level. It made our season that much harder to watch as it created an unreasonable expectation of success that we were never going to reach. Don't get me wrong, we should be happy that we have started so well but we shouldn't change our expectations of the season based on a few good results. Survival should be the goal, anything else is a bonus.

- No, just no

true,fenellakettlewitch,null,null,"I'm sorry, but if someone doesn't have the confidence or skill to drive on the motorway, then they should stick to the minor roads. All it takes is some common sense.  I wouldn't expect someone to move into the left lane if they were going to have to move back immediately to overtake, but on a freely running motorway there is no excuse. There are some rules of thumb that apply for motorway driving:

If in the middle lane and there is a reasonable gap on the left, (a couple of minutes before you will have to move back in to the middle lane),  then you should move left. 

Etiquette is slightly different if you are moving to the right lane from the middle, then you should move back to the middle as soon as possible to let others overtake you on the right as they have no where else to go. Even if this means you make more frequent lane changes. 

And on a very crowded motorway the rules change again, changing lanes becomes less productive and you tend to get all three lanes moving at the same speed. This is the only time where it is ok to stay in the middle lane.

I don't see why some people find this concept so difficult. As I said, its just common sense. No one expects you to move left for 30 seconds when they have another choice of lanes for overtaking; but driving in the middle lane when there is a long stretch clear on the left is just rude, and very annoying.

To Missy every soul sent to the afterlife because of the Doctor is like a bouquet of flowers at her doorstep with a love note.

People abducted and turned into Cybermen are basically killed, as they can't be saved once they're assimilated. In a sense they're the walking dead.

The Doctor will find himself in the middle of the Apocalypse aka the End of Days aka the End of Time. With the Earth potentially becoming the new Realm of the Dead, Missy will attempt to assume her place as the guardian/ruler of this new realm and have the Doctor join her at her side.

This is the moment the Doctor asks himself one last time ""Am I a good man"" when he discovers that he's been ""asking the wrong question"" all along.

Although I do agree with you that in this picture, having a slightly deeper line to help the defence and midfielders get a chance to organize themselves is the right thing to do, I still think we generally were giving city too much time on the ball, and by pushing the line higher it would have made it easier for our midfielders and attackers to press the man with the ball without giving away too much space.

The question is ""who should be our #2 and #3 right now.""  And Soldado may have been clinical two seasons ago, but he's not right now, and hasn't been for a year.

As you say, ""**if** he recaptures that form,"" then he will be great.  But he is not in that form now and has never shown that form in the Premier League.  So I think it's completely fair to judge his current level based on, y'know, his *current level.*

If Soldado starts actually performing like his old La Liga self, then might well overtake Adebayor as our #1 striker.  But it's far from clear that he will regain that form, and if you want to try to play him into that form, you'll be taking a risk that he won't recapture it; and you'll be doing it at the expense of Kane, who has been playing better and needs the minutes to continue his growth.

true,Evis03,cnty-uk,Welshman-on-Mersey,"1. This is part of the British obsession with bureaucracy. We tend to design business processes to cross every possibility, even ones that are stupid. Also, businesses like to have as much information as possible on who they are dealing with, and the British as a people really don't give a flying fuck about their privacy or their rights- 'I have nothing to hide' is a common sentiment here.

2. Banks can charge you when this happens, so they let it happen. Why? Because fuck you.

3. Older British citizens still use them as, I believe, do businesses. That said yeah, they really are totally unneeded in today's world. However the British tend to be loathe to let go of anything in favour of something new if it's been around for a while. This is also visible in many other areas of our culture and the way that we do business. We are quite retrospective as a society.

4. Oh god this one. The British have the most fucked up set of work ethics. In essence, if you're off sick you're deemed to be 'less of a worker'. It's seen as a badge of honour to fight through your sickness and deliver a day's work anyway. People who don't do the same are lesser workers. Never mind if you fucked up the simplest tasks because you couldn't think straight or if you infected the entire office- you made the effort and came to work. Well done. That guy who stayed home with the highly infectious flu? Fucking freeloader.

5. Salt and vinegar on chips is flawless. I don't drink that much tea (which makes me a freak among the British), but I do drink herbal teas, mainly to try and help me sleep. They don't need milk. I take my coffee black though. 

6. This one's been done to death, but yeah- don't hog the middle lane. You fuck up the traffic flow.

7. As a people we tend to polite to those we can see. Not so much to those we can't. So when you're parking and make eye contact with people, decorum tends to take over. In parking you make eye contact. Except when you don't. Seriously, you'll notice that people tend to 'steal spaces' and such far more often when you can't see their face.

8. We are finally catching up on the plumbing. Most new bathrooms have single taps.

9. Yeah this is pretty common among a certain type of person. Typically they're yuppies, but you get cocks in any walk of life. The psychology is 'if I'm somewhere else, it's someone else's job to clean it up'. It's like people who leave shit on the floor at the station because 'it's the cleaner's job to sort it'. No, it's the cleaning staff's job to handle daily wear and tear. That said many stations don't have bins anymore because it's too easy to put bombs in them. So in many cases you're ENCOURAGED to litter.

10. Get used to it. The British have a shit way of doing things. I spent 6 months arguing with British gas about a bill I didn't owe and have just spent another three arguing with Scottish power about the same thing. I work for an outsourcing provider and our service quality is terrible. British management is terrible management. They don't have the analytical minds associated with German business, or the charisma and confidence associated with Americans. They don't have the loyalty of the Japanese, or the hard work of the Chinese. British management is a fucking disgrace, and it's a shame because the average British worker while they have some screwed up priorities (see sick leave) are generally dedicated and well meaning. But without decent managers employees can only do so much.

11. Insurance is easy money when the British are generally happy to disclose almost anything on an application form.

12. This is a huge national problem and is only going to get worse. Our method of privatization just hasn't worked. At all. Taxpayers still subsidize the services a lot and service users still pay stupid prices. It seriously needs to be overhauled.


13. Too many people. The average Brit is right wing. They often talk like they are left wing and hold left wing values in many parts of their psyche, but certain triggers just turn us into Fox news anchors. The Daily Heil has learned to capitalize on that.

14. We haven't had a genuinely good leader in a while. Tony Blair was a good politician, but his abilities as a leader (not to mention certain high profile decisions) are highly questionable. The current crop are just complete shits.

15. Our education system is a favoured whipping boy. High pass year? Exams too easy. Low pass year? Children too stupid. The real issue is that many children are not taught a subject, but how to pass an exam on that subject. Actual proper education doesn't really start until University. Sadly the right wing element that is so common in Britain favours rote learning and rigid academia. As such this isn't going to change soon.


16. See Cheques. People don't like new stuff here. That and there's also this other peculiar element of the British psyche that helps explain a lot of your observations. In essence, a British person would rather spend 10 minutes actively working on a task, than spend 3 minutes doing nothing, followed by 2 minutes of work, in order to achieve the same task. Basically, we prefer to maintain constant activity rather than do something in a way that would require sitting around. In work, this means people tend to favour manually sorting and fucking around with spread sheets than using an automated system to get the same result. When something goes wrong at an automated till, you wait 30 seconds to a minute for someone to help. That time is seem as wasted, even though accounting for that time you're still probably ahead of a regular till. It's a serious problem with our culture and I feel it holds many people back from realizing their potential. 

17. Dangerous driving isn't polite. That said you will encounter nutters quite often. Country roads are filled with people who assume there's no one around and large cities have their petrol heads.

18. What?

19. Never encountered this. Are you living in Worcester?

Cheques are awesome because they're a physical payment method you can use without fear of it being stolen or misappropriated. You can give someone the cheque as you would cash but at the same time you can carry it around and nobody can steal it (well they can steal the cheque but not the money). They're also useful if you need to hand over a large sum physically. Rather than a duffle bag full of notes you can write a cheque for £10,000 and be done. As long as cash remains relevant, cheques will too - electronic payment isn't always possible or practical, particularly for older people or those without internet access.


&gt; 15.A girl from my stepson's class was saying that she doesn't have to learn, as she will finish the school, will have a baby, and will get money and housing from the council. So, is that a reason for points 10, 13 and 14? And if yes, is that intentional?

Sort of. The reason people can live off benefits so easily is because the previous Labour government (lasting 13 years) hugely expanded the welfare state (using borrowed money) to the point where it actually started to make sense to live off welfare rather than working, particularly if work was scarce. Then the recession hit, jobs (particularly better-paid ones) became scarce and so naturally people just sat around at home on benefits instead of going out to work for less than they'd recieve otherwise. This issue was perhaps compounded by the open-border with Europe which was also affected by the recession so a lot of people (willing to work for less than most Brits) came here looking for work. Cameron was then elected (well, nearly. He needed some help from Clegg) to try and sort the whole mess out and whilst he's made some progress there's still a lot of work to be done.

&gt; 16.Self-service cash registers. I love them. But why do I seem to be in a minority? Even better: portable scanners that I can take shopping. Nobody uses them but me. People sometimes think I'm the store employee as I'm scanning the stuff I'm putting in the basket.

Brits aren't generally huge fans of automation. We love technology but we have to be in control. A good example is automatic cars - you don't see many here, whilst in the US they're everywhere. Brits like the manual gearbox because we don't trust some newfangled thinkerbot computer to do things for us. We know what gear we want, and we're quite capable of changing it ourselves thank you very much. This extends to trusting another human more than we trust the device.

&gt; 18.Sour cream is a surprisingly rare thing.

It's considered gone-off or spoiled that's why. If milk goes like that we chuck it out, or perhaps sigh disappointedly and decide to make scones with it since that's about all it's good for.

&gt; 19.WTF is it with boilers?

Cold, wet country with small homes so the boiler represents not only a major element in the house physically, but also functionally because it's responsible for heating I guess.

&gt; 20.Why do I buy petrol in liters, but have the mileage in miles per gallon?

Because some genius decided we should adopt the metric system, but nobody liked it and most people kept using imperial anyway despite it being literally illegal to do so in a lot of cases, so ultimately we arrived at this stupid situation where, as you point out, some stuff is in imperial and some is metric. Generally, imperial is used colloquially but metric is used officially - miles are an exception, presumably arising from the fact that the average UK roaduser has almost no idea how long a kilometer really is relative to a mile and getting them used to it would be too much of a ballache. Personally, I prefer imperial for almost everything.

true,yatsey,null,null,"It's becoming incredibly hard to hire truly competent staff within my sector. I manage a specialist retail outlet for a company formed in 1997 with fewer than 10 locations, to almost 200 internationally. Sadly, they've only grown from the bottom and are becoming increasingly naive of the business they're running, the products they're selling and how to incentivise PEOPLE. 

Not wishing to come across like I've an inflated ego, but taking the risk - I understand the dynamics of the company,  know the products, the specialist and general consumer, but most of all the importance of invested hiring. 

For example, a little bit of insight into how the hiring process of the big wig works.

My area manager is a woman who has been hired before as an area manger in the same company. After a year or so she was directed to step down for not making the cut. Two years later, when the job became available again, every single one of the top candidates turned the job down. When offered DIRECTLY  to a good number of managers on the area? No takers. So, evidently never having heard of the Peter principle, they saw she was performing well back in her shop and...well, why not give her another chance? Well things aren't going well, but not so terribly that she's in the firing line.

By the way, I don't think she's a bad woman, she's perfectly pleasant at times...but she doesn't see past a company ideal - no original thought.

Anyway, getting back to the nitty gritty - because they're willing to settle for second best there is a dreadful stagnation. People don't move up because there are blockages - EVERYWHERE. 

Finding a person who actually understands what customer service is AND how to sell without becoming manipulative and overbearing is not easy when I, as the interviewer, hold no cards. I offer menial rewards, an uncompetitive wage, and next  to no opportunities for promotion. I can only guarantee that if they've got my back, I've got theirs; it's the only reason my staff turnover isn't quite so high. 

I have aspirations of my own, and they require money, so if promotion isn't an option - I'm looking elsewhere. 

TL;DR - Some companies after advertising and interviewing for a position, will offer top candidates the job to find all of then declining. Then they offer the job directly to managers on the area with no takers and end up giving it to someone who had already failed miserably a few years earlier in the same job. All this without considering they should probably just, offer more money and get a good deal.

true,Rohaq,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridgeshire,"It seems you're fitting in well in Britain, where complaining is a national pastime!

Anyhow, I'll go over these!

1. There's a reason why people are more likely to move house, than to switch their banks. Banks are a pain in the ass in all senses. Only open during the times you're working (or wanting a lie-in on a Saturday, but they close at 12), still charging 'admin' fees for payments and direct debits, in what is ultimately now a pretty much automated business. It's nuts.
2. See above.
3. Nobody uses cheques, except for my grandma, and she only uses them to send money to other people because she's legally blind and can't use online banking, or get to the bank easily. Even she uses chip and pin at the supermarket.
4. This depends on the company you're working at; mine will regularly ask ill people to go home if they're feeling crappy, for the very reasons you've stated. They won't even let you work from home if you're looking bad enough, because they want you to recover! But other places are complete bags of dicks about it.
5. I won't have you sullying my tea and my chips! Still, it's just a local cultural thing; me, I can't stand black tea, and love some salt and vinegar on my chips. They've got to be proper, chunky, and preferably slightly crunchy chips mind, because *fuck fries.*
6. (Apologies for the wall of text, Reddit's lists don't allow line breaks!) This is more of a safety issue. Slower vehicles move to the left to allow traffic to flow smoothly without jarring changes in speed (remember it's not speed that kills, it's sudden changes in it :P), to provide drivers with the expectation that people will generally only be overtaking them from the right side (which decreases driver stress and improves safety; ""undertaking"" is actually illegal in some countries, with the exception of certain conditions), and to help prevent the [accordion effect](http://www.ajac.ca/web/resources/article.asp?aid=2); if you're in the middle lane, there'd better be something in the left lane, and if there is, you'd better be moving faster than stuff to the left of you, otherwise why aren't you in the left lane? You're all of 20 metres further ahead just to move at the same speed, blocking off a lane that could be used for overtaking by faster traffic. If the traffic ahead of you keeps slowing down, use that opportunity to overtake them if it's safe. You should be far enough back to see a truck's side mirrors (because otherwise they CAN'T see you), which should give you enough opportunity to manoeuvre. In any case, most larger vehicles (&gt;7.5 tonnes) are limited to 60MPH anyway, fitting with the national speed limit for these vehicles, so you should have an opportunity to overtake in most cases on the motorway. Also, whilst I understand that you might be doing the speed limit, let the assholes who are speeding pass; it's far safer to let them disappear off into the distance than it is to hold them up and have them then try and undertake you later on. Let them get caught by the cops/cameras, you're not doing anybody any favours by playing traffic cop deputy.
7. Parking is interesting; expensive in places, but depending on where you live, it is nice to be able to park on the side of the road in places! You'll soon find yourself learning the free places to park in busy areas you frequent regularly, try to get there early for a spot, and then cursing the people who got there first as you grudgingly pay for parking elsewhere.
8. Double taps? As in water? I didn't even know this was a British thing.
9. Yes, these people are assholes. It's not a British thing; assholes are everywhere, even if their behaviours differ by country/region. Don't be like them!
10. Yep, services can be hit and miss. If you don't like it, complain, and take your business elsewhere; these guys don't deserve to remain open. As a result, it's not uncommon to rely on word of mouth here: Be sure to ask friends/neighbours for their recommendations!
11. Well, you don't have to insure everything, I'm pretty sure my car insurance is the only legally required one! I get medical insurance from my employer, and house contents insurance just in case. You're free to take any others as your own risk, but I would definitely recommend keeping animals insured if you have any, because vets bills can be killer, especially in their later years. But yes, you can buy insurance for virtually everything, which is good for people who do feel that they need it, but if you don't, outside of legally required insurance, don't feel that you have to buy it!
12. The quality of public transport varies greatly depending on your area, but yeah, trains are fucking expensive.
13. Morons, or people who don't know any better. It's a complete rag.
14. There are a *lot* of people who'd agree with you; his party didn't even get in with the majority vote. Unfortunately the other main party didn't either, and their leader has all the presence of a wet rag. People seem to be stuck with voting for one or the other, for fear of voting for any alternatives being a ""wasted"" vote. And honestly, under the current voting system, it pretty much is as it's lead to the current situation; a shakeup of the voting system is sorely needed.
15. This depends on your area too; in some poorer areas, many kids feel that there's no point in trying any harder, whilst in some middle/upper-middle class aras, there are parents pushing their children so hard that they're virtual wrecks before they've even left the education system. Not sure how to address this one, as I'm not a parent/child specialist myself, and whilst I hate the idea of a benefit state, benefits do need to be there for those who actually need them. Personally, I was raised to do my best, but never overly pressured. I actually ended up not doing so well at A-level (due to some of my own issues at the time), but going straight into work after, then doing extremely well in university a few years later. Now I'm reasonably well paid at a decent job and have a decent life; I couldn't imagine not working for a living.
16. Self-service cash registers are great for small purchases, but Christ, some people seem to have no idea how to use them. Watching someone slowly scanning their shopping, or failing to understand how it works is something that stresses me out big time. At least manned registers have someone on them who just wants to get someone scanned and packed as quickly as possible. I also use the portable scanners, but they're relatively new technology that not everybody is comfortable yet. Stores also seem to have gotten into the weird habit of having no bags at the cashpoint at the end, or a place to pack properly without holding up the register; I wish they'd fix that, I'd happily wheel my trolley over to a packing zone once I've paid for everything to pack it all up without feeling like I'm inconveniencing someone else.
17. No road police that you've noticed; we often get unmarked cars on some of the roads more popular with racers. I've also heard that we have one of the most stringent driving tests in the world; I'm pretty sure overtaking on a corner would get you a fail, as well as undertaking a driver outside of congestion. We have the basics of road etiquette drilled into us as soon as we get into the driver's seat. You still get dickwads on the roads, but they're thankfully the minority.
18. Tell me about it. I love fajitas, but I rarely make them because finding sour cream is a pain in the ass without paying through the nose for it. That said, it's easier to find here than it was for me in France, where virtually nowhere stocks it. Luckily they have much higher quality food otherwise though.
19. We live in a very temperate climate with very changeable weather, and not having a boiler in the winter is a nightmare, especially if you live further north - Kent probably has much milder weather.

People aren't asking Soldado to be on the pitch because of last season anyway.  They're asking for it based on his pedigree.  He had a terrible season last year, but it was an anomaly in his career.  He suffered from terrible tactics, injury, transition, etc and so while bad, he is now unburdened of a lot of that stuff that might've held him back.

Let's face it... if we were going on last year's form, did Lamela deserve a start this weekend?  Chadli?  Capoue?  Rose?  Heck, even Vertonghen?

Arguably, the only reason Lamela and Vertonghen started was because of their pedigree.  People know what they can do even if they had a lacklustre campaign last year, and so they were given a chance to play.  That they took it with both hands shows what a difference a year makes.  Bobby's got an even better record over the last four years than either of those two.

Maybe Soldado hasn't impressed Poch much during training, but he looked bright in preseason and scored a vital, well-taken goal midweek.  I never thought he was gonna start after playing on Thurs night, but to be subbed on after Kane is a bit rich I reckon.

I'm sorry but ask any leading economist. It will suffer (like everything) during a downturn but it is a far cry from how the NHS suffers during a downturn. It is much more effective at reacting.



&gt;America's healthcare system is a pretty damning indictment of that &gt;argument alone. They pay more (&gt;7% more per capita) for worse &gt;clinical outcomes. That is neither efficient nor effective by any &gt;measure a patient would benefit from.

Because America's system is not a true private healthcare system. It is full of inefficiencies because of socialist policies built up over the years (see Medicare for instance).

&gt;Healthcare is a very dodgy example too as it typically suffers from a &gt;huge information asymmetry between patient and care provider.

Ahah you can say that again. Being forced to pay for one source of healthcare and not having any choice? No one would feel like they would know what they are getting in that position.

&gt;First, most of the waiting lists aren't huge - clinical need jumps people &gt;too

I'm thinking something like this:

Dembele

Holtby

Bentaleb


**Defensive Midfielder**

Capoue

Sandro

Bentaleb if necessary

----------------------------------

With Bentaleb around, we definitely have enough CMs, so unless Paulinho can get going under Poch, he's pretty redundant in my mind. If we were to pick up Schneiderlin, he would probably be in the DM category and then we should probably look towards unloading Sandro simply because of him having been injured for so long, whereas Capoue is playing brilliantly right now.

That said, I honestly don't think we need Schneiderlin, *especially* not with the form Capoue is in. That money would really be better spent on a LW like Jay Rodriguez, because even if we keep playing with three rotating attacking midfielders, we sort of lack cover there. In that case, I would really propose we unload Lennon, unless he can find his form under Poch.

&gt; 
&gt; A contentious point, but one I feel has validity. 

hm, i feel he could have elaborated on education more, so here's my perspective on it at least

i'm from the north of england, i think our quality of education is fine, but at gcse level most local british people here don't want it/reject it

it's kind of funny because a lot of foreign students for some reason happen to really crave the education they're being given at gcse level, and completely flourish off of it

then what's pretty interesting is that you're able to leave school at 16, so all the deadheads quit ASAP and go to work at B&amp;Ms of whatever for the rest of their lives, but then all the people who actually care about education move on to A-Level where the standard of teaching is just as good, but yeah, because the people there want it, the education system from there on out is able to produce some REALLY smart people,

same with university

so yeah, the people that come out of university (having been given this amazing system of education) are some of the smartest in Europe, but like, the 70% that never really cared to begin with and drop out at 16 like... the football hooligans, the racist van drivers, the chavs, the clubbing women, are by contrast some of the stupidest in europe

so basically there is a big, biiiiiig divide, and it's to do with the quality of the person (upbringing, wealth, family background, location), which is what the government should be trying to change, not the education system, which although will never be perfect, is very solid",0,1409019145,null,0,false,0,ck0jlu9,t3_2ej1zf,t1_ck0jlu9,t1_cjzxtkb,null,1427357683,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I would rather add couple of points too, from non-drivers perspective, I you like:

- _Buses_:  having ride in bus is a whole culture. I wonder why bus drivers are so nervous, everytime, especially at night shift they turn even more susceptible to external factors such as plead to open the door, ask the road, or ask for something else. There is always some prick in the lower deck who drives the driver nuts. In the upper deck there is always a crackhead smoking a pot and halucinating, a homeless having a childish sleep and a group of drunk as fuck teenagers shouting as if they own the whole universe. Daytime bus shift is all about mommies with their buggies.

-_Big Issue Salespeople in the street_: What do these guys do for living? For the last 3 years of living in London, havent seen anyone buying it. There are other useless stuff sold on London streets such as cheap watches, used phones and PCs. Who is going to buy them?

-_Marmite, Kidney Pie and Black Pudding_: Honestly , guys, why?

-Unplanned suspensions in Tube lines and Overground, especially during weekends.

-London Cabs: I don't know what these cars do in the streets, because they are always occupied, and it is impossible to catch the empty one. Only way to find a cab is to order one by telephone.

-_No transport to Heathrow terminals at night._  I have spent 5 hours and commuted 4 buses to get from South East London to Heathrow T4. This is so foolish. I understand that there should less transport during the night, but in every major city in the world airport communication works all arounf the clock. There must be shuttles every 15 mins going to Heathrow all terminals from Central London. 

-_No food after 11 PM_: You cannot buy or even order food online after 11 PM, as if noone works at night, and the whole city dies. Only some rare Macdonalds stores work, but they are usually filled with half-conscious drunkards.

So I had the luxury of experiencing some decent highs (FA Cup Trophy and Champions League) but mostly lows.  I had the opportunity to see Spurs on a few different occasions when they passed through the States and intend on visiting WHL this year (as a co-worker based in London has been a lifetime supporter and has season tickets).

I recall the days of scouring the internet for a livestream but with NBC covering all EPL matches, it makes it almost too easy.  The challenge comes during tournament play but FSC or Bein are pretty good.  You made the right choice.

The attackers are encouraged to take liberties and find places where they feel comfortable/ where they can create positive opportunities with their teammates, but the system itself is there to support them. 

so often last season it felt like players were either glued to their position on the formation graphic or just running around like kids. This year were already seeing players find each other in positions that they *want* to be in-- it's not like they need to be taught how to make plays, they just need to be given the green light to do it within a system that has their back if it doesn't work out.

&gt; A girl from my stepson's class was saying that she doesn't have to learn, as she will finish the school, will have a baby, and will get money and housing from the council. So, is that a reason for points 10, 13 and 14? And if yes, is that intentional?

How does the relative ranking of your Polish school compare with that of your son's British school? Because that's quite important.

I know East Europeans like to wax all superior about their school systems relative to the Brits or the Americans (I would know, being Russian) but for some reason it isn't getting translated into more productive workers or more innovative scientists. I suspect a large part of it is accidentally comparing higher than average or merely average schools in their home countries with below average British schools.

&gt;__Caernarfon Castle__ ([Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language): *Castell Caernarfon*) is a medieval fortress in [Caernarfon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caernarfon), [Gwynedd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwynedd), north-west [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) cared for by [Cadw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadw), the Welsh Government's historic environment service. There was a [motte-and-bailey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey) castle in the town of [Caernarfon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caernarfon) from the late 11th century until 1283 when King [Edward I of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_I_of_England) began replacing it with the current stone structure. The Edwardian town and castle acted as the administrative centre of north Wales and as a result the defences were built on a grand scale. There was a deliberate link with Caernarfon's Roman past – nearby is the [Roman fort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castra) of [Segontium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segontium) – and the castle's walls are reminiscent of the [Walls of Constantinople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walls_of_Constantinople).

pros:  Well, she actually didn't do much fighting but she was smart. I mean really smart. Grow up on Galifrey smart.  Always good to have someone around capable of operating the TARDIS and knows the fundamentals of space and time. (a testament to the Galifrey Public School system)

* Having Suarez wouldn't have prevented those three goals from being conceded. Defense still an issue, but hopefully it will improve as new signings bed in and back four becomes more settled.

* Johnson poor again. Never like to see a player get injured, but it may be a blessing in disguise.

* It was good to have some of the new signings get some minutes after the game was pretty much gone.

On one hand, they need to acknowledge that the show is almost fifty-one years old and has had some great moments over the years that ought to be remembered.  On the other, they should allow the new series to be an actual show and not just an hour of nostalgic fangirling each week.  I think it ought to be a continuation of the classic show and if Doctor Who hadn't been taken off air in 1989, would they be quoting The Three Doctors just for the sake of it?  I think the way they've been doing it is the best way.  They try to bring back at least one classic monster every series, and I think that's enough.  As far as quoting classics and dialogue referencing classic episodes go, they ought to keep it to a minimum.  That quote about the TARDIS having been redecorated to the displeasure of the speaker is starting to get old from overuse.

true,grollcool,null,null,"Not really. And for the record I am not against Chelsea buying out Torres contract, I would actually prefer it if it was the only option, but the thing is that it shouldn't be.

Buying out a contract is essentially the price of a transfer. Torres in essence is asking the club to pay ***him*** 16 million pounds as a transfer fee, only then to go to another club and probably sign a huge sign on bonus because he would be free.

Not only would he get 2 years of wages for nothing, but he would get much more as a sign-on bonus and would be able to use the next 2 years to be paid another set of wages by his new club.

In football, if you want to leave to another club you hand in a transfer request. You don't fucking ask the club to buy out your contract. This way Chelsea can negotiate a settlement (transfer fee) with another club and he can continue his career. That is the industry standard, this method he is trying to do is as far down as you can go. It's a disgusting business practice and is **never** encouraged. Try to find out the last time someone tried to make a club buy out *their* contract just so they could go to another team.

If he tries to make it an ultimatum and refuses to transfer to another team and demands all his future wages payed and full the club should simply banish him to the reserves. Just like he is within his rights to ask for his contract to be bought out, the club is within their rights to not play him and exclude him from the first team for the duration of his contract with the club. 

If he prefers that instead of getting a transfer to another team it says a lot about his character.",0,1409032133,null,0,false,0,ck0ose7,t3_2eiqz0,t1_ck0ose7,t1_ck0eayo,null,1427355161,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

I worked with Polish software developers and worked in Poland one week in three.

1. Apartment blocks look like something out of District 9 - on the outside. Inside, flats are cosy little palaces.  
2. Washing machines in the bathroom? I guess it kind of makes sense - there's already water and a drain. Do you wear ear defenders when you're busting for a poo and its just started a spin cycle?   
3. Every apartment block seemingly has a) a tanning salon b) an alcohol shop open from 6:00am to 4:00am.  No corner shop. Don't people ever need milk or eggs  or Bisto or a lottery ticket?  
4. Winter tyres! I didn't know these existed before I spent time in Poland. I asked a friend how people managed to drive so well in freezing conditions - in the UK people slide into each others cars at T junctions at the first sign of a frost.  
5. That horrible Pork Gristle on bread people eat with beer.  
6. Jars of sauerkraut big enough to house a family of four for a couple of Zloty. I miss sauerkraut.
7. What is it with those ultra-salty twiglet-sticks and dry wafer biscuits? It's like crack to software developers. Every half hour they'd hit the kitchen to re-salt themselves, then eat two handfuls of dry pink wafers. The cupboard under the sink was stuffed with industrial quantities in catering packs.  
Edit: more...
8. Education. The guys I worked with were very well educated, ultra-bright and very academic. Sometimes this caused its own problems, partly I think because there wasn't the same built-in 'commercial awareness' you get in non-ex-soviet Europe. We were two days away from a delivery deadline when the development team leader asked me to ""Please explain to customer that there is a six month delay and they must pay extra"".  He'd  been having a beer with his University Professor (he'd left university six years before), who had advised that the software architecture we were using was 'incorrect' so we would need to scrap the current build and three months work, design a new framework and recode the solution. It turned out that 'incorrect' meant not wrong, not faulty, not less supportable, just 'not perfect'. We delivered the original software on time, but it was an immense struggle to get pretty much the whole team to understand good-enough is perfectly acceptable, and that we'd have been out of business in a week if we'd changed to the new 'perfect' solution.

true,theodrim,null,null,"I'm still sticking to the Rani, though it may be a healthy amount of wishful thinking on my part. Why:

- Michelle Gomez is the spitting image of Kate O'Mara. She even had the mannerisms and speech down. In an episode the subtext of which were familiar faces and familiar places, that's not easily ignored or passed as mere coincidence.

- There were two direct parallels in *Deep Breath* to *Mark of the Rani* I've noticed so far. The opening of *Deep Breath* was the TARDIS being coughed up by a time-displaced T. rex; the ending of *Mark of the Rani* was a time-displaced T. rex about to eat the Master and the Rani while inside a TARDIS. During the climax of *Deep Breath*, the Doctor makes a snarky comment about Clara not being vegetarian in the context of a larger dialog about killing without purpose; in *Mark of the Rani*, the Rani makes a snarky comment to the Doctor about humans being carnivores, in the context of a larger dialog about killing without purpose.

- Both episodes were about, more esoterically and less persuasively (because it's the plot of about half of *Doctor Who* in sum), predating humans. In an episode the theme of which was ""been there, done that, can't quite place it"" this and the previous points are not easily ignored.

- In universe, the Rani is a Time Lady in exile, and therefore likely to have not participated in the Time War. Not that she'd have cause, save as justification to engage in more experimentation. More importantly, the last we saw of her she still had her TARDIS. Both these things point to a high likelihood the Rani is still alive, outside the time lock on Gallifrey, and up to her old tricks, and with the oldest question in the universe extent and suddenly silenced likely to come looking for the Doctor if alive and active.

- The Rani and the Doctor were youths and went to the Academy at the same time, so there is a possibility they at some point had at least a dalliance.

- Lastly, if the leaked script pages and reports from on-location shooting of episode 12 (I'm not posting spoilers, you can find those yourself if so inclined) are accurate...that's absolutely, positively a stunt the Rani would pull.",0,1409033473,null,0,1409034206,0,ck0p5zw,t3_2el2t7,t1_ck0p5zw,t3_2el2t7,null,1427354985,16,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,16

The character had the potential for greatness,  but in her time,  the Doctor was so in woe over his loss of Rose,  that the focus on that took away from Martha's development.  Or so i think.

At first I disliked the first episode a lot, and thought they should have done a better episode as a reboot episode, for a long time, I wished they had of had 'blink' as the first episode, and had Sally sparrow join as a companion. That would erase eccleston's stupid smile, and get rid of rose as well. Not that in HATE rose, but she is my lest favorite companion, and everyone else's love for her makes me dislike her more for some reason. 

But now I sort of appreciate him as the 9th doctor, mainly due to the fact that nobody could have done 'empty child' as well as he did (except maybe capaldi, but that's still a pretty big maybe)

Although this is a common claim, it is rarely followed up with a compelling 'because..'

But that's the point about why Salmond is using the terms ""asking for a mandate to negotiate"".

Darling couldn't add the because either, because it makes Westminster appear a bit like a bunny boiler acting irrationally when a relationship breaks down.

To clarify, there is nothing to compel England to be in currency union, but if it doesn't there will be a negative impact on England.

One of the most important items are that without currency union the mechanism for splitting up the national debt is problematic. The thing is it can't be claimed that Scotland refused to take it's share, it can be claimed that Scotland was refused to be given it

true,PRFourL,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"I'd like to wade in here, having just passed the whole GCSE thing myself, first of all, I agree completely with the notion of your education depending on where you live. Thankfully in my hometown in Hampshire the schools are superb (and the colleges) and my 5 years were full of dynamic learning and problem solving, however I have many a friend in the north of our country where it seems (bit of a broad statement, I know) that the standard of education is horrific and consists of learning out of a textbook for 5 years. 

With your point on ""regurgitation of data"" yes, there are some courses that still rely on you learning fact but moving on to A level there are some facts that you just need to know. However this is a minority if your school picks the right courses. I did OCR Gateway science where 25% of my course was a practical investigation (for each science) which consisted of: research using secondary data, plan, prelims, plan, experiment, data presentation, data analysis, evaluation, conclusion. This whole thing seemed pretty robust to me, in addition to this the actual science papers were heavily focused on methods and investigation with long answer questions making up the majority of the marks. Also the course is so regularly updated that all the learning is of new and relevant science.

I agree with your statement on English but think that it is more what you can get away with rather than the actual courses being useless.

Apart from that my option subjects in history and geography were fantastic based around debating, questioning and evaluating. Sure you needed to learn facts but only so you can strengthen your argument and understand context.

true,rosscatherall,eng-TyneWear,Zoocastle,"I'm currently in receipt of jobseekers allowance. Since January of this year I have received 9 sanctions. All of them have since been overturned after it was all found to be the fault of my advisor at Avanta (a work programme the jobcentre works closely with).

The problem with fighting a sanction, is that the sanction department no longer have time limits to get back to people on it being sorted out, because there's that many of them being passed through.

I went 5 weeks without anything coming in a couple of months ago. 5 weeks waiting on a decision of which I had written evidence that it was the fault of my advisor (sending my post to wrong addresses).

It's easy to forgive them for it happening once, perhaps twice due to system errors. But after the 9th time spread over a number of months and getting the same excuse, you kind of figure something else is going on.

I had to get my MP involved for the 8th sanction. That's the one that took 5 weeks, and it was only 5 weeks because my MP took on my case and chased it up.

It's easy to say 'he must have been doing something wrong' if you haven't had the experience yourself. It's a long, worn out process you must go through to get your sanction repealed. I'm still paying back debts I had to take on at the time to pay rent and bills.

Last month I got in contact with the jobcentre to request all correspondence between Avanta and the jobcentre regarding these 9 sanctions of which they complied. I have masses of paperwork backing up my claims, if you're still in doubt I wont hesitate to put these up.

I also have a recorded conversation I took with my Avanta advisor claiming that the 'work programme regulation book' that they must abide by, is apparently wrong. That was after I confronted them about sending my post out too late to arrive to me. That was what my 9th sanction was for. An appointment letter arrived too late for an appointment. My advisor claimed that posting the letter 2 days before my appointment, second class, was more than enough time. The regulation rulebook states they must give a weeks notice for appointments.

*Edit*

I feel I should add in that my jobcentre bent over backwards to help me out with my sanctions. But with the sanction department being hundreds of miles south, there was only so much they could do. Often times they themselves weren't even informed about the sanctions so on going in to try and appeal them, I just couldn't due to a lack of information being passed over.",0,1409037062,null,0,1409039847,0,ck0q172,t3_2ekj6x,t1_ck0q172,t1_ck0odhp,null,1427354581,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

true,Grrrmachine,null,null,"This post will get drowned, but it'll provide some counter-perspective for you. I'm an Englishman who's lived in Poland for 10 years, and your country still weirds the hell out of me sometimes.

* Food. You have amazing recipes like pierogi, leczo, bigos, big chunks of golonka, and the world's most incredible array of sausages. It's like you can turn a pig into a magical meat wonderland of flavour. And the bread? Loaves stuffed with plums or cranberries, soft or crunchy rolls, dark, grain, rye... it's a baker's paradise. Considering these two incredible foodstuffs, can I get a bacon sandwich anywhere in the entire country? Nope

* Christmas food. You celebrate Christmas the night before, by banning all the tasty stuff mentioned above (no meat, no alcohol) and instead punishing yourself with the worst food available. Carp. Herring. Bland pasta covered in poppy seeds. Is this some masochistic torture for all the sinning you've done that year?

* Religion. Apparently, everybody's Catholic. If your car breaks down on the street no-one will stop and help you. Old ladies will spit and curse at you for kissing in public, and everyone cheats each other as much as possible, including never paying any taxes. People really are awful to each other on a daily basis. But they still go to Church on Sunday and own a picture of...

* John Paul II. Yeah, I know, 28 years a Pope. 28 years where he did nothing to help the spread of AIDS in Africa or end the sexual abuse of children in the Church. Dead for 9 years. But still many Poles think he's a saint and own a poster/calender/icon of him. What's the new Pope's name? Don't care, the only Pope is JP2.

* Driving. Bulgaria has worse roads than Poland, and fewer people are killed in car accidents. The Lithuanians have worse cars, and kill fewer people. The Italians have more treacherous geography, the English and Swedish have worse weather, and the Germans drive faster, and still Poland kills more people with cars than these countries. Why? Polish people suck at driving. Really, you're awful. Maybe because you're always rushing around the country on...

* Holidays. 26 days per year once you reach 10 years of employment (or 3years + 5years of studying). Plus 12 national holidays, so 38 days off a year, or nearly two working months. How does anything get done? How, even in the capital city, do shop-owners shut down for the whole of August and still run a successful business? Which leads to...

* Service. You'll never feel less welcome than when you walk into a shop and ask the seller for something. 99% of the time the answer will be ""no"". The other 1% the item will be handed to you in awkward silence, with an evil glare for interrupting their peace and quiet. In supermarkets, you'll go the entire transaction without hearing a single word from the cashier except...

* ""Do you have any change?"" I'm used to this from homeless people. Not from the store clerk, desperate to get the 5- and 10grosze coins from my pocket. The sale was 49.56zl, I gave you a 50zl note, but you still desperately plead for the 56grosze in change so that you can give me 1zl back. In a tiny village shop, ok, I get it, but in massive outlets with 20 cashiers? This is retarded. Especially in...

* Home improvement stores. Castorama, Praktiker, Obi, Leroy Merlin - huge palaces to consumption where you can buy curtains, wood flooring, lamps and bathroom furniture. Finally, you can decorate your apartment the way you always dreamed, filled with furniture from Ikea or BlackRedWhite. These names are confusing, but it's ok: *they all sell exactly the same products for the same prices*. You had Communism for 45 years where everyone wore identical clothes and lived in identical apartments with identical furniture. Now, after 25 years of capitalism it's exactly the same, except it's the people's choice. And Ikea in Poland is more expensive than the UK.

* Bureaucracy. I'm from the UK; I don't have an ID card. I don't have one in Poland either, but I do have a unique ID number (PESEL) and a registered address (meldunek) and a tax number (NIP) and a business number (REGON). I couldn't get an ID card becuase you need meldunek for that, but you can't get meldunek without an ID card. I worked my way around it to buy a car and a flat, butI can't be registered (meldunek) in  my own flat for more than 5 years because I don't have an ID card, even though I'm listed on the land ownership record (KW) as the owner. It takes five different offices to deal with this shit.

* Decograms. If I buy ham or cheese I don't buy it in kilos, or grams, but decograms. What the fuck is a decogram? ""20 decos of ham, please."" Or 200 grams, for normal people. You don't use decolitres for beer or vodka, but you'll use decograms for ham, as if you've invented a metric pig. 

So if it's so awful, why do I stay here?

* The weather. People think of Poland as some grey gloomy landscape, like Siberia but with more pork products. But it isn't. It has 4 very distinct seasons that are all just long enough, and even from my window in Warsaw I can see gorgeous August sunsets shining on the browning leaves of the old chestnut trees over the road. I regularly stop and stare at the beauty of the weather here.

* The geography. Mountains to the south, sea to the north, a massive lake district and some of the most ancient oak and pine forests in Europe. This place is a natural wonderland, achingly beautiful in its wilderness.

* The architecture. Poland's awful and awesome history means towns are actually distinct from each other, and Lublin is different to Krakow or to Wroclaw or to Gdansk. This is unlike Britain, where every town up and down the country has a stone cathedral surrounded by fake Tudor townhouses and a generic high street filled with the same bloody shops. Yawn.

* The people. Once people accept you, Poles display a level of genuine warmth that I never experienced in the UK. They'll hurl abuse at you on the roads and elbow you in the street without saying sorry, but if you're invited to their house you're an honored guest and nothing is too good for you. Instead of a bland evening supper of polite conversation and dinner party games (like England) you'll be invited to a three-day weekend at their place in the country with rivers of alcohol and more sausage than a Gay Pride festival. Which is how Poles ""relax"". A ha ha ha.

* The humour. A very dry humour prevails in Poland, mixed with a taste for the absurd. Classic books and movies are either very subtle or utterly outrageous in their weirdness, and once you get that into your head, real life in Poland starts to make sense (in the sense that you know it will never make sense).

* The work/life balance. The long holidays and generic product availability is frustrating at first, but then you learn it's how Poles think; Work to Live, not Live to Work like in the UK. Britishers put in 40-60 hours a week to fill their overpriced house with stupid shit they don't need, so that after 45 soul-destroying years they can die of a heart attack with shitloads of debt. Poles would rather save save save, pay cash up front for a couple of good products, and make those things last the rest of their life. People at the age of 25 are trying to buy the houses they'll die in, people avoid mortgages and credit cards as if they were ebola, and trade promotion and career prospects for family time with the wife and kids. As a result, they have much less stress and more stronger relationships with their family, even if it means they can't afford a 50"" TV and three foreign holidays a year. I think that's a much healthier balance (although it's starting to change).

* Food. Microwave and oven-ready meals are almost unheard of. People cook fresh, and cook often (or their mothers do it for them). In summer the street stalls are bursting with fresh fruit and vegetables, and beside a few kebab and Asian bars, fast food is almost unknown. People don't really go to restaurants at all, and even Warsaw (a city of 3million people) has a very limited range of places to eat out - not only because of price, but because the stuff made at home really does taste so much better. It's also healthier, which leads to...

* Women. Girls here are beautiful, not because of genetics but because of style. They don't turn into lardbuckets at 25 like their British counterparts, they don't sport horrendous fake tans, buckets of makeup or trampstamp tattoos, or follow the latest retarded fashion trends. Sure, there's always a tasteless minority, but more often than not the women focus on looking elegant or chic rather than Kardashian clones. It's beautiful without relying solely on sex appeal.

* You can compliment people. I can tell the women in the office that their hair looks good today or that I like their new shoes without being considered sleazy or a potential rapist. Men can say nice things to women (things they honestly mean - those *are* nice new shoes) without the risk of HR getting involved for sexual harrassment. 

* More seriously, politics. People here are informed, and the newsagents actually have a choice in weekly magazines on art, science and politics (wprost, polityka etc). Even the existence of metalist idiots like Kaczynski and Korwin-Mikke helps people have actual debates on what's important for the country, rather than the pathetic dribble of PR quotes that the British hear from Cameron and Clegg.

* Largest apple producer in Europe, and you've only just (last three years) learned how to make cider. But it's good cider - clean and fresh.

* Culture. People here have read books, recognise classical music pieces, enjoy attending the theatre and are open to discuss these things. Water cooler talk is about current events, be it big sports matches or global wars. It's not endless asinine bleating about whatever was on telly last night.

There's some snark and humor involved, but it's part of his charm. He also does episode reviews and reviews of several other toys/collectibles.

The trans-temporal is fun just for being different and making so many different sounds. And also compatible with the personalise your own sonic set...which I'll eventually shill out for just to have them.

11's has the big red button flap and that's the only way it can be activated in the extended position. 12's replaces that with a modified button meaning that the same button activates the effects in both positions. The effects and such are exactly the same.   They are, however releasing/released a ""touch control"" sonic which has the button to extend, but instead of buttons to activate the effects has some form of touch control to activate(haven't seen anything other than the promotional images on online merchant's pages to give any more detail about that) and like every 9/10 sonic, the bottom part will come off, but instead of being an ink nib or just a plastic tailpiece, it's what's called a ""power core."" Could be something from future episodes or just another sale gimmick. Honestly, it's barely worth it unless you just want to be a completist about it.

EDIT: Also, if you have 4's, 5's is just a slight repaint. That's really the only difference. And 8's...well...It has a button to activate instead of sliding the collar down.

Please don't read this as a criticism of your driving, but more as an explanation as to why changing your driving makes sense (for you and others). I enjoyed your post immensely, I miss so much about my home country, other things not so much (I'm talking to you, weather!) 

The first point is on safety. You may not realise it from your position, but it is exceptionally dangerous in the circumstances when two drivers travelling at different speeds, but faster than you arrive at the same time. They both have to judge and so just their speed, looking around unnecessarily. At high speeds the potential for driver error (not everyone is an amazing driver, sad fact of life that we have to deal with) is increased. It's pointless, just move over, consider others. Why do you feel the need to sit in the middle? (Genuine question, please answer.) 


Secondly, you should only really leave the left hand lane in order to overtake, it's the law. Now, I and many others adopt a more dynamic approach. You have stated it seems ridiculous to hassle someone and then overtake at only a couple of mph faster... But you wouldn't think this if they were travelling that speed, having not had to get you to move over.

As for the dynamic approach, I think there is nothing wrong with little burst of gentle acceleration in order to overtake a vehicle that is travelling very slightly slower than you. You may well be breaking the speed limit for a couple of hundred metres, you won't be burning in hell for that. In this way, you can accelerate into the traffic flow, when there is a reasonable gap, overtaking that Eddie Stobart, pulling back in and settling back to your comfortable speed, leaving the maximum amount of carriageway free for other road users.

The only reason you would ever get stuck behind a slow coach in the left hand lane and is poor anticipation, particularly on motorways you should be looking round constantly checking mirrors (and blindspots if you need to) and always have a pretty good idea of what the traffic is doing 10, 15, 20, even 30 seconds from now. Particularly large, slow moving vehicles... You can see them for miles, why not react sooner.

&gt;___Y Wladfa___  ('The Colony'), or more fully ___Y Wladfa Gymreig___  ('The Welsh Colony'), also historically and occasionally ___Y Wladychfa___  and ___Y Wladychfa Gymreig___,  is a [Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) settlement in [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina), which began in 1865 and occurred mainly along the coast of [Chubut Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chubut_Province) in the far southern region of [Patagonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonia). In the 19th and early 20th century the Argentine government encouraged immigration from Europe to populate the country outside the [Buenos Aires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires) region; between 1856 and 1875 thirty-four settlements of immigrants of various nationalities were established in [Santa Fe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Province) and [Entre Ríos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entre_R%C3%ADos_Province). In addition to the main colony in Chubut, a smaller colony was set up in Santa Fe by 44 [Welsh people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_people) who left Chubut, and another group settled at [Coronel Suárez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronel_Su%C3%A1rez) in southern [Buenos Aires Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires_Province).  In the early 21st century around 50,000 Patagonians were of Welsh descent.  The Welsh-Argentine community is centred on [Gaiman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaiman,_Chubut), [Trelew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trelew) and [Trevelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevelin).  Chubut estimates the number of [Patagonian Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonian_Welsh) speakers to be about 1,500, while other estimates put the number at 5,000.

&gt;**Quick-fire Questions for 1 word answers**

&gt;1. Who has been our best player so far this season

&gt;2. If a £16.5m offer came in for Mirallas, do you sell?

&gt;3. What position do you think we will finish?

&gt;4. What ended up costing us the most- bad luck, bad tactics or bad play?


1. It would be James McCarthy. No one else is even close.

2. No. Who can we get for that money who's better than Mirallas?

3. I think we will finish 5th, maybe 6th, although with a bit of luck 4th isn't out of the question.

4. Bad mentality. We choked and the lack of concentration is costly and has cost us points.


&gt;
**Post-Arsenal match discussion topics**

&gt;Mid-term (until Rossy is back), what is the best position for Naismith and Lukaku. Naismith up top worked well this week, but is Lukaku wasted when pushed out wide?

&gt;Expanding on the last question, ours wings have talent- but who is the best option on the left and right hand sides of the pitch?

&gt;How can we get Lukaku into the game more, without the direct linkup balls from Rossy that he thrived on last season?

&gt;Who should be buy and why?

I think it's just more of a makeshift tactic to take advantage of Monreal. Lukaku started up front with Kevin on the right and Peanuts on the left and Naisy in the hole. Rom didn't move to the right until Peanuts got injured. I think he'll be up top again.

With Rom starting at the 9, I think he'll be just fine.

true,moulting_mermaid,null,null,"This is probably going to sound slightly offensive but I think many of these observations are to do with the area this person lives in and thus quality of schools, restaurants and class of people
he is hanging out with. 

As a South African who has lived in the UK for more than 6 years and has worked in educational psychology in the UK, I can honestly say that I've never come across many of the things he talks about. Firstly, the UK has some of the top universities in the world and along with the US has a disproportionate number of top universities relative to it's population size. It goes hand in hand with this that it's schools can't be bad. Unfortunately because the majority of people send their children to state schools the school you end up at depends on the area you live in. Some schools in areas with high areas of immigrants fall sharply behind because the teachers are teaching children how to speak English while their contemporaries are moving ahead with other things. What is great though is that all schools are independently assessed and ranked and so you can choose what area you live in based on how good the schools are. Some inner city schools in poor areas have had so much investment from government and charities that they outperform schools in richer areas. I use to work at one of these schools.

I've never heard anyone talk about their boiler unless the damn thing has unexpectedly broken but I'm sure this would be true of all people who own electrical appliances.

I've never seen dirty plates in a restaurant and I've never been into a place that offers vinegar with chips. Although that is a traditional English thing it seems that in more upmarket areas it has died out. 

What he says about cars, traffic and driving is largely me same as my experience. 

One other thing is that I find the Englishnto be amazingly unmaterialistic despite the eneonous wealth of many people. In many countries people spend a disproportionate amount of money on their cars. In South Africa someone with a house worth around £100k will spend £25k on a brand new BMW whereas in the UK people with £1 million houses will be happy driving around in a slightly worse for wear second-hand Volvo worth £12k.

The people I'm living with have been a big help in finding my way around and introducing the country to me.  Another tip that may be useful is that the cost of living does seem to be a bit higher than in the states, depending on where you're from.  Their money here is worth a bit more but tend to have the same number for the price. For example, say a bottle of coke in the US is $2. Over here it could be £2 which converts to roughly $3.40.

2: US does this too. It helps them get money, and the bank owners become rich. It's not really for your benefit

3: I don't know, a lot of places seem to require checks (US again... since that's my only source of knowledge) or stuff that is not cash, so that it has a lower chance of being counterfeit or something.

4: You only get a set amount of ""sick"" days. A lot of people literally cannot afford to go over the amount of days they are allowed to be sick, or, in severe cases, can be fired simply for being sick too often even if they don't go over. Why? Because they are costing the company money for being absent. I am not sure how this translates to Britain though, because the state I'm in has job laws that allow either you or your employer to terminate your employment at ANY time. Others force a notice of two weeks.

5: I don't know, this is British people being all British or something. Also at first I thought you meant ""crisps"" because we call them chips, with vinegar, and I was going to comment on how delicious they are. I could see your version of chips being okay tasting too.

6: Middle/right lane are for faster travelers if I recall. It's common courtesy to let the guys who think they need to get somewhere in a hurry go in those lanes, and if you're driving slower to be in the leftmost lane (rightmost if in America or... Australia. maybe Canada too... I think) Also what you described is called a ""Douchebag"", ""Douchecanoe"" ""Wanker"" or ""Ass/arsehole"". Sorry you come across so many of them.

7: If you visit America you'll find a lot of the same practices from Poland, it seems. Only specific areas you're allowed to park on the street for free, and it is not always calm.

8: I'm not following this one, sorry. (I don't know what you're ""on about"".)

9: People who wear suits for a living are usually the most disgusting of us all. They're entitled assholes who treat everything and everyone else as if they are inferior (typically) even if subconsciously. Welcome to the first world.

10: What the fuck? .... Okay either you're going very cheap, or something is very wrong. I don't know what's going on here, but that sucks.

11: In America we are pretty much forced to insure now, seriously... It's law. House, Car, Health. You can have renter's insurance, phone insurance, bicycles, animals, life insurance, expensive item like tv's/computers.. Everyone wants to make money off you by promising money back if stuff fails, then making you go through hell to actually get some of the money you paid them already for said item. YAY capitalism!

12: Trains... Trains.. Oh those things that make my 50 mile commute take longer. Yeah, no. I have no idea what riding on a train is like because my state is as large as the entire country you now reside in, and it would be woefully inefficient to set up proper mass transit to get from one side to another cheaply and effectively since our population density is far lower.

13: Is that a newspaper? I have no idea. Those aren't really circulated as much anymore.

14: Sorry, I don't keep up with politics. It just infuriates me, and I get enough of that from working in a call center.

15: Hit and miss here. General rule of thumb seems to be stay away from large cities with a reputation like milwaukee or detroit if you want to get a good education.  What you explain seems to be someone that tries to game the system for a free ride. They're not usually intelligent, and seem to think the world exists to support them. It can, kind of, but only barely. They'll be in crippling debt most likely for the remainder of their life if they stick to that plan. Or at least that's what would happen here.

16: Technophobia.  Old people that have gradually seen technology rise around them are afraid of it, rather than embracing it, and prefer speaking with an actual person. Maybe that or we are just sociopaths, since I do the same.

17: I think this has to do with how people are raised. I assume it's similar where from a young age you are taught to look both ways, be kind or whatnot.. and the government likely advertises or supports driver safety in some way. Also I don't know how easy it is to find a very cheap car in Poland, but here it can be very very necessary (reminder: 50 mile commute, one way) so you want to take care of it because you can't afford not to.

18: It may be that I live in wisconsin, but we have a lot of sour cream things. Also cheese curds. You should try some :)

19: boilers as in... machinery that heats water to make what comes out of the faucet/shower warm? You've got me, I can't imagine why it's so popular.

20: I apologize for the imperial measurement system, even though my country didn't start it, yours did. We didn't get the update though and forced it to stay 'popular'.

 [**Time-weighted return**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-weighted%20return): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __time-weighted return__ (or __true time-weighted rate of return (TWROR)__) is a measure of the historical performance of an investment portfolio which compensates for external flows. (External flows are net movements of value which result from transfers of cash, securities or other instruments, into or out of the portfolio, with no simultaneous equal and opposite movement of value in the opposite direction, as in the case of a purchase or sale, and which are not income from the investments in the portfolio, such as interest, coupons or dividends.) To compensate for external flows, the overall time interval under analysis is divided into contiguous sub-periods at each point in time within the overall time period whenever there is an external flow. The returns over the sub-periods between external flows are linked geometrically (compounded) together, i.e. by multiplying together the growth factors in all the sub-periods. (The growth factor in each sub-period is equal to 1 plus the return over the sub-period.)

true,Snixozz,null,null,"Welcome to the family!

What every Liverpool supporter, player and manager likes to say is that this club, is more then a club. It's a family.

For history of the club, a quick wikipedia search will do it. But for short: Club started in 1892, have won the premier league 18 times, and the champions league 5 times. (Haven't won it since they changed the name to Barclays Premier League though.)

This year we sold our best player by far. He scored 31 goals for us in 33 matches. (He had a 10 match ban for biting a Chelsea player back in the 2012/13 season, and still managed to get top scorer to find a Liverpool player also taking on 2. place, which was Daniel Sturridge.) I am of course talking about Luis Suarez.

We now have built up a stronger squad overall, which is mostly consisted of young players. Except Lallana (26) and Rickie Lambert (31). Lallana isn't ""old"" to be a football player, but comparing him with our other transfers such as Oirigi (19) Emre Can (20) Lazar Markovic (20) you see the difference.

So short said, this year Liverpool aren't favorites. We are being critisized for our signings this year, and such as ""Liverpool had an iPhone and lost it. To make up for the lost iPhone, Liverpool bought a Nokia, A computer, an old camera, and a typewriter"". This of course is complete ballocks if you ask me, as I think our signings have been amazing, and if not this year, then next year or the year after that we will finally lift the trophy that our legend captain Steven Gerrard will be very happy about without doubt.

This club needs time this year as our newest signing -----&gt; Mario Balotelli, needs time to find his place. 

Brendan Rodgers also needs time to figure out the best formations and starting lineup to go with all his new signings and the squad overall.

I just thought i'd do a quick summary for you to have a read on and get some insight in what's happening and what's good to know when following Liverpool.

true,JoeMTB,null,null,"My two pence as a duel national British American:
1. Banks are ridiculous. Don't even get me started on things like mortgages, opening times, online accounts, over drafts. Ridiculous. 
4. Ill people at work? British people love complaining, if they stay at home then they can't voice their complaints to as many people! I'd like to think that complaining also explains point 10 - we secretly enjoy a bad service so that we can moan about it. My girlfriend REGULARLY pays £50 for a haircut and ALWAYS complains that they didn't do it right but never says anything to them. I got so fed up of having shit hair cuts that I started doing it myself and 9 times out of 10 I do a better job than they would!
5. You're wrong. On both counts. 
11. Don't insure everything. Ensure your car and building and contents, then everything else is optional. Getting a mortgage I had the bank trying to get me to buy life insurance for me and my partner teling me it was essential, but upon reading up I found out they just wanted the 25% commission from their chosen insurance company. Scumbags. 
Ironically, scumbags is also the answer to 13.
14. Why stop at DC? Name one politician who isn't a complete wanker, I dare you. 
15. If you think the British system is bad, take a quick look at the US education system. Going from British to US and back to British I can happily say that British is far more advanced but there are some serious changes that need to be made. Having an actual teaching in charge of the gov's education department could be a good start... just saying. 
17. Are you serious? In London there are cameras ever 10meters. In Wales, we have lots of warning signs and no actual cameras though - swings and roundabouts. 
20. Our entire measuring system is flawed. We buy milk in pints but Pepsi in litres? We measure driving distance in miles but running in meters? And let's not even get onto the subject of cooking... it just goes mental there.

I actually didn't see the Doctor Who movie but when Eccleston and the reboot came out I was quite pleased with what they'd done.  Sure, they were a little too cautious in some respects with breaking old habits (*coughslitheencough*) but the Ninth Doctor felt like a genuinely fresh take on the character, like he had actually grown.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The first issue they ignored was the European Union. The current President of the European Commission has stated that it would be difficult for Scotland to become a member of the EU in the case of independence. There is a suspicion that Spain will block Scotland's entry into the EU to stifle their own independence movement in Catalonia. Also, it will most likely take a long time for the Scottish government to successfully complete the process, which leaves it in a limbo state for some time. The question of needing to adopt the Euro to become a full fledged member is also a problem. Some other countries have their own unique agreements, but I wonder why Scotland believes that it will be on an equal negotiating table when attempting to receive the best deal. Also, considering that the debate on Scottish independence was focused on Scotland's sovereignty, it seems rather ridiculous that they are not discussing the EU in further depth. There is a massive debate in the UK and other European nations about the organisation due to the burdens it imposes in terms of regulation and austerity measures (see PIIGS countries). How does Salmond intend to retain Scotland's sovereignty and ensure that the will of the Scottish people is followed? With the UK, Cameron has a better position of renegotiating the relationship as the UK is one of the biggest economies in the EU. Scotland by itself will not be such a large economy.

Leaving aside the issue of the EU, I believe that the real issue of Trident was fully ignored. Although there was a reference to the costs of continuing it, Salmond and Darling completely ignored the deterrence theory and how having nuclear weapons can affect our military power. Plus, Salmond did not answer the question of nuclear sharing in relation to NATO. All member states do have to help with the delivery or storage of nuclear weapons, even if they do not have their own weapons. The Scottish government's anti-nuclear stance and its willingness to join the NATO seem to be at conflict with each other. 

The issue of Scotland's relations with other countries was also not discussed. Scotland as a smaller nation would have less negotiating power in the world in deals and may be more susceptible to pressure from more powerful nations. China is an example. Recently, when the Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited the UK, he met the Queen. It was reported later that the Chinese government threatened to cancel the visit if a meeting with the Queen (for propaganda purposes) was not included. Bear in mind that this happened with the UK, one of the biggest economies in the world and still a global power of sorts. How weak would Scotland be in negotiations with the Chinese? 

The question about the military and intelligence services was not addressed at all. Many intelligence operatives come from Scotland. What would they do in the case of independence? Furthermore, how would Scotland develop its own intelligence services? Also, would Scotland be part of the Five Eyes? Ireland isn't. Considering that the nature of security threats is evolving (with more terrorists coming from groups like the Islamic State), it may be dangerous if Scotland doesn't have access to the best intelligence.

Also, it seemed strange to me that many of the problems they were discussing came about because of the Conservative government. Many people agree that the privatisation of the NHS is being accelerated under this government and its efforts to reduce the deficit have led to welfare cuts. Many problems exist (in their eyes) because of a 5 year government, in a union that has lasted for over 300 years. Does it make sense to vote for independence because they disagree with the policies of the Conservative government? Indeed, Labour have stated that they intend to repeal many laws like the popularly dubbed 'Bedroom tax'. 

Those are just a few issues that I believe were ignored or sidelined.

I'm hoping to see Davies instead of Rose for this game. Despite his great performance against QPR, he's still a bit shaky defensively and most of Liverpool's attacks will probably come from one Coutinho/Sterling/Sturridge from either side feeding balls to a lazy but clinical Balotelli. I think its key we stop the balls from coming into the box in the first place, rather than have 2 or 3 people man-mark Balo all the time.

Might consider playing Bentaleb and Capoue again, or even Paulinho for Bentaleb at maybe half-time or vice versa. A lot of us will probably we cooped up behind the halfway line and having someone who can quickly bring the ball forward to our strikers will be really crucial.

true,AlxxS,null,null,"&gt; The NHS is a monopoly. It is an inefficient system that allows people no choice in their healthcare ...  

&gt; Being forced to pay for one source of healthcare and not having any choice? No one would feel like they would know what they are getting in that position.

Whether its a monopoly or not is debatable, but the NHS typically doesn't act as one (i.e. doesn't abuse its position to keep others out of the market, doesn't implement price discrimination etc.). This is evidenced by the fact I and many others get effective private healthcare in the UK alongside the NHS.

The NHS acts as competition in the market forcing providers to offer better service to be viable, it doesn't keep other providers out of the market. 

If private providers can offer effective treatment at lower cost [then the NHS will even outsource work to them](http://nhsforsale.info/private-providers/private-provider-profiles-2/virgin.html), just as it can - and does - for many other services such as HR, IT and other back-office functions.

&gt; It is an inefficient system 

All operations, especially at that scale, have inefficiencies. I've not seen any compelling evidence that the NHS is less efficient than it's peers; indeed, the studies I've seen [conclude the opposite](http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Guardian/documents/2011/08/07/JRSMpaperPritWall.pdf). Do you really think that WalMart, McDonalds, Target, HP etc. don't have efficiency issues? 

&gt; What the market offers is what people want, and resources are allocated accordingly. Having humans predict where time and money should be spent does not work as effectively.

For basic commodities like pasta and curtain hooks then, for the most part, sure it generally works. Still, as I said before ...""Market failures of all kind exist in the private sector as well."" and ""This is simply untrue. It may be more frequently successful depending on the market, but its simply not guaranteed."". 

Ethical issues such as [those raised](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2ek1vc/superior_private_health_is_a_myth/ck0qqel) by /u/Ed__ below aside, I really do take issue with your apparent faith that the free market would work here.

The competence of our representative is a question, but the system for appointing the officials is pretty transparent.

The president then takes all these nominees and decides which position to give them.

Effectively we've given Juncker a mandate to pick the nominees in whatever position he likes because we voted for him.  In the same way we don't get to decide if Theresa May is given a Home office job or another job because that is David Cameron's decision. In this case Lord Hill isn't getting a key role because Cameron (because he is petulant and was throwing his toys out of the pram) picked someone who was unknown in European circles and who has little experience in this area.

Banks - Agree with the debit thing. NZ, commonly about 3-5 years behind on most things the US or UK will have (Internet Speeds, TV shows, Fashion, etc), has had EFT-POS for over 17 years (Electronic Funds Transfer at Point Of Sale). It's instant, and declines if you have no money. You can also access up to 3 accounts from the one card. UK, 1 card, 1 account, and it will then take between 2 hours and 5 days for the funds to be taken out. Then you go into overdraft you didn't authorise.

The account getting is worse than I think OP is letting on, and the same goes for Utility Bills and anything else. To get a bank account, they want a utility bill with your name on it. The get a utility bill with your name on it you need a bank account. You also need a job, typically. Most work places won't put through you contract until they have all you bank details for HR and accounting. To get the account you need a signed letter saying you have a contract....


Why exactly do I have to remember my National Insurance number, and my NHS number? The only reason for the NI number is to contribute to the NHS. One number should cover both (again, I'm spoiled in NZ with a single ACC number)

Transport - ok this one's very recent, and probably only for London - but if I have money I should be able to get on. Now they are all card/Oyster card (travel card) only, but there are only top-up points at tube stations. Well if I have to get a bus to get to the tube station...

Food and Drink - Fish and Chips, why do they leave the skin on the fish, it's 15 seconds extra filleting, and you can eat the whole thing. Also, pints are served in pint glasses - so unless it's your drink you're buying and you sip it down a bit the moment you get it, you spill the first 2 mouthfuls carrying it away from the bar. This goes double for cider.

Other - Celsius when it's cold, Fahrenheit when it's hot? (Ooh, it'll be down to -2 tomorrow... Oh but today it was in the nineties!). 

I love this country and don't plan on going anywhere else at this stage in my life. And the people are fantastic.

Yes, their money may go further than ours, but that is no good if the majority of them have very little money in the first place. If you have 10 Americans, 9 of which are on 5k a year, and 1 American on 55k a year, that looks like a GDP(per capita) of 10k. When in a matter of fact, 90% of people earn half of that. We use the GINI to measure inequality and really ought to be taken into consideration as well as the PPP. The US has very poor income equality, which should massively skew results.

So what needs to be done is a consideration of living standards (we can use the Human Development Index - which includes GDP, rather than GNI) against the GINI.

Luckily said work has been done for me;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_inequality-adjusted_HDI

It would be better if we could equalise income demands (taxation, etc) as the two countries place very different requirements on gross-income even before considering the price of goods. This needs to be equalised first. This is called the GNI and measures gross incomes. What we need is then is something similar to the PPP, with income and purchasing taxation removed, then the elements of the HDI applied, then GINI coefficent applied.

If Quebec is any indication, a No vote would actually strengthen the SNP as they can continue campaigning as a national centrist party which can blame failure on Westminster, keeping them relevant. This is especially true since Yes voters are getting the impression that Westminster is not going to play nice afterward and would rush under the banner in self-defence. They might even develop like Labour, treating Scotland as a safe seat and growing fat and corrupt of it.

A Yes vote might actually weaken them considerably as it would remove the cohesion which has kept largely disparate elements of the party together and it no longer has an exterior force to oppose, while the subsequent disorder of the scottish tories and labor giving new parties the opportunity to get ground.

I was raised by a very hardline unionist family (all TUV voters, stupid I know) personally I consider myself to be a human (not saying that unionists and nationalists aren't human lol) rather than a unionist or nationalist. That said I still have very strong views on the union, I don't class myself as a unionist because I feel badly represented by the politicians in that field plus its easier to make friends with someone of a nationalist background when they ask your religion/tribe and you just tell them neither.

That said I do still go to the twelfth, bonfires etc. I don't go for secterian reasons. I just go because it is good craic.

If tomorrow I was to wake up to a united Ireland however I'd leave for England. I just hate the thought. We wouldn't have as much representation in parliament as we do in stormount and as such I'd be a little worried of how we would be treated. Particularly unionists around issues like Parades, Flags etc. such a view is probably nuts in this day and age but I thought it worth mentioning.

I would genuinely feel like my culture was under threat. And I know people take the piss out of us for saying things like that but things like the twelfth is a big thing to me. It is a part of who I am. The British culture is my culture because that is how I was raised. I have no doubt that the Irish culture is good but I PERSONALLY think that as we are we have the best of both worlds. 
We can say we are Irish and also British and both cultures can be celebrated side by side. There is a legitimacy in both claims of being British and Irish.

Okay, so as long as you're fine with dealing with international fees etc., and assuming you won't have a problem with being a little bit older than your course-mates in Sidney (Cambridge has four dedicated mature colleges, which obviously would have a different, more 'mature' atmosphere), then I couldn't recommend Sidney more, especially for history!

A couple of useful links, first on undergraduate admissions at Sidney which is worth having a click around:
http://www.sid.cam.ac.uk/admiss/ugrad/index.html
And second, University advice on mature students, perhaps useful to you:
http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/access/mature/

A note on **entrance requirements**, obviously Cambridge is very competitive, and offers made to UK students are very high. I don't know about the NZ system, but I found this page on the Cambridge website: http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/international/qualifications/newzealand.html
A quote from that page on entrance requirements based on the NZ system...
""Typical offers for applicants studying the *NCEA Level 3 would be based on a majority of Excellences* in relevant subjects to be studied. This is to be endorsed with Excellence.""
Of course, mature applications are different, so I don't know if these sorts of expectations would apply to you too, so if you don't have these kind of results don't give up hope immediately, to be honest the best way of finding out if your application would have a good chance is asking directly. I'll give you a useful contact for that in a second.

A note on **History at Sidney Sussex**. It's fantastic. Sidney has some extremely well respected historians in diverse fields who you will come to know personally. Prof Tim Blanning is *the* name for almost anything in 18th Century European history, and if there's something worth reading about Medieval France, Prof Rosamond McKitterick probably wrote it. Along with these leading lights are several other History fellows, all of which are both friendly and extremely bright. And if you decide to study in their fields, students from Sidney will have priority to have them as their supervisor (ie. one on one teacher, you have a hour long session with them a week, where they will mark and discuss your weekly essay with you, before setting you another for the next week). Of course if your interest isn't served by one of the Sidney History fellows, that's no problem, you will then be paired with a Supervisor from another college, who is an expert in that field. There is an diverse range of period which you can study, to give you an idea, in your first two years, you will study five papers, chosen from this list: http://www.hist.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/tripos-papers/part-i-papers-2014-2015

Finally, **Life in Sidney Sussex**. I love Sidney. It's right in the centre of town, which is convenient, but it has some gorgeous gardens hidden away round the back which are fantastic if you want to escape for a little while. It's one of the old colleges (418 odd years!), so its front three courts are beautiful, and the college itself is steeped in history. It's also not too big, so you will come to know quite a few members of college quite well, giving the place a nice community atmosphere I can't imagine you'd get at the huge colleges like Trinity or St John's. Overall I love it, but do think carefully about what you want from your college, like I said in my earlier post, it's an important choice!

There's much more I could say but I've written too much already. **My overall piece of advice would be to email the Admissions Director at Sidney, Dr Kirsten Dickers**. She's absolutely lovely, and if you ask her any questions you have about entrance requirements, fees, being a mature student, or indeed anything about applying, she'll be very happy to answer. Her contact details are here: http://www.sid.cam.ac.uk/aboutus/people/department.html?deptrequest=A

Other than that, I hope this has been useful, any more questions you have please fire away, and good luck!

---

&gt;Joel Hirschhorn  of Harvard Medical School discovered that lactase persistence was due to the presence of a haplotype composed of more than 1 million nucleotide base pairs, including the lactase gene. The presence of this gene is the cause of lactase persistence. Today, this haplotype can be found in 80% of Europeans and Americans of European ancestry. On the other hand, the percentage of the population who are lactase persistent in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia is very low. It is absent in the Bantu of South Africa and most Chinese populations.  These geographical distributions strongly correlate with the spread of domesticated cattle. About 5,000 to 10,000 years ago,  this haplotype came under very strong selective pressure. This period matches the rise of dairy farming. As dairy farming originated in Europe, Europeans were exposed to increased lactose nutrition provided by dairy products, resulting in positive natural selection.  The additional nutrition provided by the dairy was very important for survival in the recent history of Europe; therefore the supply of fresh milk leads to the favoring of the lactase persistent trait. As dairy farming spread across the globe, after the separation of Europe-derived populations from Asian- and African-derived populations, and after the colonization of Europe,  the strong positive selection occurred in a large region, leading to the global spread of lactase persistence.

Scotland, in the past has shown remarkable innovation in the field of science especially for a country of its size. The question is that would Scotland be able to keep up this trend without adequate Government funding? I don't think anyone wants to see Scotland lose it's edge in Science as it has contributed so much. But would the an independent Scotland have time to focus on more niche science markets in an independent Scotland? What would stop them from travelling to the United Kingdom where their research could be funded?

There are a lot of research based charities who also rely on the money that is given to its area and I am personally worried about the their ability to perform up the same standards without as much funding. This world doesn't need less funding to Science and Scottish scientists shouldn't have to leave the country to receive it. Could a few agreements be brought up when discussing independence such as maybe a British Isle wide science funding agency? I personally don't think that Science and research has been getting enough attention during this referendum with a lot more focus on other albeit more important question to the average Scot. 

Feel free to add any thoughts.

[Subside](http://www.subsidebar.com/) is my usual haunt, dirt cheap on tuesdays and wednesdays, and open till 6 in the morning on weekends so you can keep drinking for longer! Very friendly place too, you'll always have people coming over to say hi if you're on your own.

More specifically for the metal music and my other usual pub is [Scruffy Murphys](http://scruffymurphys.co.uk/), a rock/metal pub with a great atmosphere, but lacking in anywhere to dance or headbang (although you'll often find a few people in the middle of the pub floor giving it a try), and is also on the slightly more expensive side (compared to Subside)

And similar to Scruffys is the [Flapper](http://www.theflapper.co.uk/), another excellent rock pub with a good atmosphere too, although it seems to alternate between metal and indie music there, still haven't quite figured out the pattern yet though!

For a dedicated nightclub you'll want [Eddies](http://www.eddiesrocks.com/), recently moved to a new venue and is probably the only dedicated rock/metal club left in Birmingham. Atmosphere and music are both great, and the prices aren't bad either!

While I'd describe it as more of an alternative club than a rock/metal club [Uprawr](http://www.totaluprawr.com/about-uprawr-birmingham/) exists, and while it is very cheap the music certainly doesn't appeal to everybody in our musical community. I know for myself I prefer my rock and metal classic or heavy, whereas Uprawr is more metalcore, pop-punk and the odd bit of dubstep.

So on that basis a family *could* afford the trip but would need to save up for it and not spend disposable income on other things. Assuming they mean disposable as in ‘once rent and food and bills are factored in’ – a day at the beach seems entirely affordable to any family that doesn’t mind cutting back on a couple of things in order to achieve it.

For instance, GCSE geography just required you to take in the information the teacher gives you then spit it out onto a page.

You have to find reliable information on your own, developing your research skills. Part of the course requires you to set up a study of a local area (using an aim, hypothesis, theory, safety test, location planning, method); a skill I've been assured is useful in many areas. It the also teaches useful data analysis skills such as spearmans rank and chi squared, and other geographical tools such as mapping, graphing and reasoning in a conclusion. 

Then the tests themselves require a whole lot of reasoning and thought - much of it will be taking what you learn and applying it to a question rather than regurgitation. For instance, we learn about overpopulation in Sao Paulo and use this information to answer something like ""Explain the likely consequences of urbanisation in an area you have studied"" - the questions are way more ambiguous so you aren't prompted to start writing everything you've learnt. Also, if you did do that, you'd run out of time and fail because you only need to write according to the question, so writing everything you kno would be a complete waste of time because half of it would be irrelevant.

1) Shoes in the house. Take ya fuckin shoes off! Filth from the street in my living quarters. Yuck!

3) Dining al fresco is basically impossible, the weather here being uniquely grey and damp. Guess that's why we small talk about it all the time..

4) Everything is so smooth. I take your point about morons who don't know/don't care to help you out in shops, etc. But mostly, everything is where it should be, and services are reliable.

5) Agreed, we are the best drivers in the world. There ARE haughty, ornery pricks on the road (they are always older, white men with more money than me) but mostly the etiquette behind the wheel is in a league of its own, even amongst European nations.

6) We need to quit this Amercanised, watery frappatino ""coffee"" bullshit. Buy a percolator; percolate. The Mediterranean way is the only way.

7) I actually think English kids are pretty intellectual. I have been teaching English for a while in Britain to economic migrants from Spain, Italy, France, etc. Not one of my students has been able to tell me how old the earth is. Not one has been able to tell me why drugs are illegal. Not one has been able to tell me who said ""cogito ergo sum"" nor what it means. And these are all highly-qualified professionals - engineers, architects, chemists. I find that strange.

8) That said, we English people are so propagandised. We have some education, but our political awareness is pretty low. My friends are aware that the queen is a nazi-sympathising vampire with 1/6 of the inhabitable land of planet earth in her possession. But most (older?) people think she's ""just a nice old lady"".

true,ryzzus,null,null,"Hello,

The most ridiculous point for me is second one. Once I lived in Scotland for nearly 6 months, found place to stay, managed to open bank account, worked - life went well. 

After this period I came back to Poland for a year or so. Before leaving, I managed to get the cash from the bank account through ATM. When I was in Poland I've payed something with the card through internet, don't really remember what and what amount it was - not huge for sure.

Imagine my suprise when I went back - this time to England. Started working, gave the account number to my new employee, went to the bank to check if everything is fine and find out that I owe 450 pounds! I've overdrawn for like 4 pounds when I was in Poland - and they kept charging me with the same amount every month untill I've reached this level of overdraft - then it was passed to debt collector and they were about to chase me. 

When you read this, the question appears - how I didn't know about that? - it's my fault because I didn't have internet banking and didn't check what is going on with the account when I was in Poland. Landlord from whom we've rented house didn't have contact with me - probably bank gave me notice to that address.

I just had to pay the money.

I've tryed to get the money back but the bank refused. I've heard that there was like big case in UK about that kind of situations. 

Always open simpliest account that they have in your branch. It's possible to have an account that they don't charge you with overdraft - they just didn't inform me with that when I was opening one.

(basically a few companies offer a couple of days a year where basically you can skip work for no reason. they instituted it so people stopped lying about being ill)

10) thats a 'your mileage may vary' situation. It's not symptomatic of all services

13) the daily mail is the residue of a colonial mindset where britain ruled the world for several hundred years. As people got less bigoted over time (mostly because older generations were dying off) the niche right wingers who think that AIDS INFECTED ILLEGAL EUROPEAN ASYLUM SEEKERS ARE GOING TO COME OVER AND TAKE BRITISH JOBS AND MAKE YOUR CHILDREN OBESE, require something to voice their backwards and scarcity mindset.

14) hell to the yes about Dave. but you have to remember about one thing, as bad as there are aspects of britain it is infinitely more multiculturally tolerant than europe and in particular eastern europe. I'm sorry but its true. I have friends of different ethnicities over here that can get around in most towns aside from stoke, inner city london and glasgow no problem. The worst they get is maybe some people talking shit about them or denying them job applications. In eastern europe they would get jumped. It gets worse the further east you go. This is unpleasant to say but its true as well. Inter-ethnic hostility is very much normalised in europe.

16) people hate self service cash registers because they like not having people unemployed and replaced with automation. Also it goes back to tradition and having someone to nod at and thank when they're doing your shopping is normal. Also it feels like a fucking chore. So you're telling me i drive into your store, pick up my groceries, **and** you're not even going to do the bare minimum of processing my goods or bagging them up? why the hell should i even go to the store, better to order online in that case. I come to the shop to get my shit and have someone process it and bag it for me and smile fake pleasantries with me. 

19) This has literally never been a topic of conversation ever by friends. In fact there's a polish guy who lives near me that fixes up fridges and white goods (electricals). All he ever talks about is white good electrical. But i don't extrapolate to say all polish care about that.

true,p_gascoigne,flair3,,"Well, first of all Song is not a box-to-box midfielder. Also, Wanyama is very much a defensive midfielder. 

The term Box-to-box does not imply that the player is merely running from box-to-box. But, that the midfielder has good skill around both boxes. Zero goals, as with Wanyama for Southampton, and 11 goals throughout his career for Song (even though he has played for two of the most free scoring teams in Europe) certainly does not imply you have much presence in the opposition box. 

Examples of a box-to-box midefielder: Kroos, Toure, Lampard (in his youth), Paul Pogba, Dembele, Schweinsteiger, Jamie Redknapp, and finally, the best box-to-box midfielder the world has ever seen: Paul Gascoigne.

At Southampton Poch used two defensive midfielders, along with an attacking midfield troika behind a striker. Not unlike what we have seen at Spurs so far.

The second risk is what we've seen happen to the euro, where a lack of the correct political union has caused a number of problems. Scotland is debating independence, but then wants to hand over some of those powers... Something the rUK wouldn't be willing to do.

&gt;___I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream___ is a [point-and-click adventure game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-and-click_adventure_game) based upon [Harlan Ellison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Ellison)'s [short story of the same title](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_No_Mouth,_and_I_Must_Scream), developed by [The Dreamers Guild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dreamers_Guild), co-designed by Ellison and published by [Cyberdreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberdreams) in [1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_in_video_gaming). The game's story is a set in the world where an evil computer named AM has destroyed all of humanity except for five people, whom he has been keeping alive and torturing for the past 109 years. Each survivor has a [fatal flaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamartia) in its character, and in an attempt to crush their spirits, AM has constructed a [metaphorical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor) adventure for each that preys upon their weaknesses. To succeed in the game, the player must make choices to prove that humans are better than machines, because they have the ability to redeem themselves. Woven into the fabric of the story are ethical dilemmas dealing with issues such as [insanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insanity), [rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape), [paranoia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia) and [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide).

On the other hand, the people of Britain are a lovely bunch and the right cup of tea after a hard days work is to die for.

So take the good with the bad I suppose, except here the good is really good and the bad really bends you over. Some people are a real stickler for following the rules and get scared when they stray outside of it, which leads to anger and then things may start to get unreasonable. An example of this is middle lane hogging, where people think because they're going faster than the lorries that they shouldn't be in that lane because it's *effort* to change.

To be honest, if the left most lane is clear you should be in there, it's not the ""lorry lane"", it's the left lane. If you aren't overtaking the people on the left at a reasonable pace then realistically you should drop a few MPH and travel with them.

With regards to aggressive drivers, don't worry about them, some people aren't the most pleasant. If you get someone belting up behind you while you make a manoeuvre, just complete your manoeuvre then let them get on their way. I usually drive at 80 on the motorways, it's the speed I default to, during the night it's easy, sit in the left lane, there's nobody around. However during the day, this usually means I'm switching between the middle and right lane quite a lot. I'm cool with the constant switching, if you check your mirrors in advance it's quite a painless experience indicating then switching lanes, but sometimes you will have people come up and start to be aggressive and to be honest, it doesn't really matter. I usually find making brief eye contact using my rear view mirror to be an effective way to get them to back off.

He pointed out that this education system promotes laziness, doesn't require effort and does not award any actuall skills, knowlege and basic IQ.  
Someone respondend that the education system is more focused on training actuall job skills, before basic knowledge and overall academic information. 

What I meant, is that even me, who has some serious reservations to the education system, understands and agrees with the basic principles of a broader range of basic education. It's not to fill your mind with useless and forgetabble dates, definitions and strings of numbers. It's to offer every child, teen and adult with a broad field of knowledge, and allow them to learn just a tiny bit of everything in order to let them choose their future career with as much opportunity and options available to them. No child at the age of 10, 15 or even young adult of the age of 18 or even 20, despite their former educations being basic or very specific, will be able to fully tell you what he or she is going to be doing in his or her future, or what his best skills are and what type of job or carreer is the best for them. Because it's not that simple. A human is a complicated organism, having a brain with a very large potential does not automatically mean you will use the most of it towards betterment of human species.  Some people, even smart people are very happy with their simple job, simple life and some people, even in their limited options, will always remain unhappy, whatever they decide or are forced to do.   Of course, there are always exceptions to the basic rule. 
Education does not equal future job skills and does not guarantee future employment. Even if you dropped out of elementary school and went to welding school, it does not guarantee that you will be a welder in your future, as much as if you went to university to study science, does not guarantee that you will become a scientist. Both of you might end up flipping burgers or winning a noble prize in the future. However, both of you are a bit more prone to end up in the field of your chosen education.    
Education is not for you to memorize poems, it's to learn history of literature, it's to let you understand poetry, to understand why some people are great at moving the hearts and emotions of millions ,and some people should not be allowed near twitter. Of course not everybody will understand it, not everybody will appreciate it, but all of them should be given the option to do so, even if it means forcing young children to read boring poems and sometimes memorize them as part of your student activities in school. It's not all just gold stars and cheating on tests.   
I wen't throug all the classic education. I remember very little of it. My father went through all the classic education. He is a very learned, educated, well spoken man, and I envy his wast knowledge on some many fields of science, history, technical and literal skills. It just means that not everybody is able to fit in the education system, and for some people, university is not the best option. Nor is colledge, or high school, or technical school or whatever you may call it. That is why our education is segmented into parts with multiple options to fit the widest scope of humans.    
I do agree, that the system is flawed, that universities fill you up on useless bullshit and studies are clogged up with paperwork, busywork, and copy and paste, memorize and forget type of in and out education. However, I do not need a degree of physics to have a vague understanding on how a tv works or I don't need a degree in literature to be able to discern a good book from a terrible waste of paper. I am able to do those things thanks to some of my education I took in school, which I didn't really want since I hate physics and I am very bad at it, but that does not exclude my main hobby to be hardware and computers, and does not forbid me from building pc's as a great use of my free time. I've been building my computers for over 15 years. I didn't like very much many of subjects I was forced to learn, but I need them to be able to discern bullshit from real science. To not believe creationism over evolution, and to not to give my money to solar highway scammers out there. I need to know how my body functions, to understand how to feed myself and how to dress, and how to function, to discern when I'm sick and when I just have the cold. These all things are available to us through common education system. And training us to be programmers or paper pushers or burger flippers does not allow it all. Saddly, most of people who even are able to make a rational decision about their future when they are in their teens, won't end up in their chosen fields, and it is still mostly luck or connections that allow us to have great jobs, or even bad jobs at all, and not our very specific education, even it you have a very narrow specialization. I myself for most of my life wanted to be in a specific field, I studied it wih a passion, I still love it. But I'm not working in this field, and I  am able to still be happy and to like my job. Nobody, except a very few lucky ones, knows what to do with their life, and even less people will be able to do what they really want to do. That is why they need the options to be somebody else, or else they end up unhappy and uneducated with nothing to help them in their unknow and uncertain futures.

If she hasn't looked into it already, then a Debt management plan may be the way forward. This would allow you to stay debt free and would allow her to pay off the debt in a more manageable way.

If you are certain you want to take out a loan for her, which I would discourage if at all possible, I'd definitely recommend having a look at the [Money Advice Service's advice on deciding on the best type of credit for you](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/deciding-on-the-best-type-of-credit-for-you) and specifically their advice around [credit unions](https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/credit-unions). A credit union is likely to be your best bet so have a look into them.

My last piece of advice would be not to go anywhere near payday lenders, the interest they require you to pay back is extremely high and will trap you in a cycle of debt. It is not worth it and there is always another way.

Also: renting a flat. 

You might as well be buying instead of renting for all the references/checks/credit/downpayments they require you to have for a flat rental. Landlord references, credit checks, employment checks (at least 6 months of paystubs required...so good luck renting if you've just arrived in the UK), downpayments for rent before you've even signed a letting agreement that can span anywhere from 1 week's amount to 8, and they still might even ask you pay 6 months rent up front.

It is there, in their hopeless situation, that they learn about a man named Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, a peculiar cross between Osama bin Laden and Tyler Durden, who calls on them to leave the prison cells their parents rent behind and head to Syria or Iraq to engage in a holy war.

&gt; And so off they go. After their copy of Islam for dummies arrived in the mailbox and their neckbeard had grown long enough to make the girl their age behind the counter in the supermarket frown a bit, it is time for them to head to Iraq.

&gt; Mind you, these young men don't go there to kill. Killing is secondary to the higher goal, which is martyrdom in the name of Allah. It is time for us to recognize what this is, a thinly concealed suicidal impulse by youth from a culture where suicide is highly taboo. The rate of suicide attempts in youth from Muslim background in Europe tends to be much higher than it is in indigenous Europeans. To assume that this desire is caused by religious fanaticism is to seek too much behind it, religious fanaticism is merely an expression of the real desire they have, which is to die.

you are correct that the main problem you might face is her not paying you back. but this could happen for a variety of reasons - she might lose her job, or she might start spending all her income on something else (it could be something positive like a masters degree, or something bad, like a gambling addiction). Equally, she could choose to stop paying you, particularly in a situation where you guys break up.

it isn't fun to consider, but you have to know what you would do in any of them (and others besides).  If you were a bank, you'd repossess the car in fairly short order, because it is losing value every day.  you may be reluctant to do that, and unless you have proper legal documentation, you won't have the power to do so anyway. getting a solicitor to write out how the loan would work is expensive and annoying, but protects you both from misunderstanding each other or a change in the situation. 

i don't know about the mortgage/credit rating situation, but if you were buying together, i would hope that a bank would view it as a zero-sum gain (she has an existing liability, but you have an equivalent cash-paying asset)

would it not be simpler for you to just buy the car, and let her use it in return for paying for all maintenance/consumables/insurance?  you could always sell it back to her in a couple of years if she is desperate to consider herself the owner. this would have the advantage that you'd be the legal owner, and aside from you suffering the depreciation, you'd stand to lose much less in the negative situations because it would be your name on the V5. that's probably what i would do.",0,1409053831,null,0,false,0,ck0t5mr,t3_2em6q1,t1_ck0t5mr,t3_2em6q1,null,1427353123,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

Maths isn't much harder than GCSE IMO (especially C1) although further makes you think a bit more.

You get a formula book so not much straight out rote learning.

&gt;__The Europa Tower__ ([Lithuanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_language): *Europos bokštas*) is the tallest [skyscraper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper) in the [Baltic states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_states).  It is located in a district of [Lithuania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuania)'s capital, [Vilnius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius), called [Šnipiškės](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0nipi%C5%A1k%C4%97s). It rises 148 meters above ground level. It was designed by the Vilnius based, *Audrius Ambrasas Architects Company*. Dominating the skyline of the newly developing New City Center, the building was completed and officially opened on 1 May 2004, as part of Lithuania's celebrations upon entering the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union). The [skyscraper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyscraper) caused some controversy among some of the public and some watch-dog groups because of its interference with the historic skyline of the [Vilnius' Old Town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius%27_Old_Town). Despite varying opinions, the tower is now often regarded as a modern landmark of the Lithuanian capital. There is an observation deck on the open roof terrace at 114 m (374 ft).

true,sunbeam60,null,null,"Start keeping track of what you actually spend. Most banks allow you to download your statements as an excel file or similar. Start categorizing and summarizing your actual spends per month - you'll be surprised (I was) where your money is going and it's a real eye-opener.

Getting an overview is step 1.

Step 2 is letting your spending patterns be changed by your new knowledge. ""Gosh, I spend a lot on takeouts; maybe I can let this one slide"". This means you create a budget where, informed by your knowledge of actual spending patterns, you allocate fixed payments and averages of your spending. Consider opening a second current account, with no overdraft but with a VISA attached, that you can use to transfer your spending money to. Let all the fixed spends come out of your salary account and use your spending VISA day to day. If it denies you a transaction, it because you're spending too much. Every time you have to use your regular current account card, absorb the fact that you're now spending your savings (as you will have to transfer from savings to cover it).

Step 3 is creating a savings pot. As you will be saving month by month (or, potentially, as larger contracts pay out), an ISA makes the most sense. Moneysupermarket.com, or any other comparison website, can give you best rates. Most you can open on the internet. Do yourself a favour and get a 30-day retained payout account, so that you can't immediately move money from savings into your current account. Also open a non-ISA savings account with the bank you've got your current account with - use this as a buffer so some money is immediately available. When it overflows some limit, move the money to the ISA. If it underflows, suck it up and transfer from your ISA and let that pain form a constructive memory.

Step 4 is planning how to allocate your savings. What is the goal with the money your saving? If it is long-term, start investing. Fidelity, and many, many others, offer investment funds (pooled, managed allocations of bonds and shares) that have various risk strategies. The less risk, the less chance of gain or loss. If you need the money in less than 5 years, keep them in cash/bond funds, or in your savings account. The further away from 5 years you need the money, the more risky your investment should be (remember ""risk"" is defined as chance of gains or risk of loss). Keep investing in funds or keep in savings accounts, don't invest in shares directly - chances are you won't know enough to manage your savings directly (I don't, so I don't blame you).

Step 5 is feeling that warm feeling of saving for something and actually buying it.

Throughout, be wise about how you spend, seek better deals, negotiate with all providers, keep changing insurance providers every year etc. etc. Subscribing to Which and reading personal finance blogs (like moneysavingexpert.com) will help you in this.

Stay away from most finance deals unless you absolutely have to - most have to get a mortgage, but don't drive in a financed car or something like that. Accept that it will look like you have less money than others, but you're actually just being wiser. 

Being good at personal finance is about accepting crap now for better gain later. Drive a 7 year old car. Keep using your old TV. All that money is now working for you instead, which means you can retire early and/or in comfort.

true,Throne3d,eng-somerset,Somerset,"I definitely agree with your description of the GCSEs - just went through them myself, and the language exams are evil. Not just that they have trick questions, often use short words like ""doch"" or ""nie"" (German: however or never) or ""malgré"" or ""ne... que"" (French: despite or ""only"" (though it's got ne, it's not actually negative - it's really harsh)). Plus, after that, the grade boundaries are really close. So, it's fine if you have a really good understanding through to an amazing understanding, as you'll probably be at A or A*, and ranging somewhere between 60% marks and 100%. However, if you get just 10% fewer marks, you could have dropped down to a C.

I did, however, ""enjoy"" them (not really, but I preferred them to the other exams), because they weren't so mind-numbingly boring. They also help to pick out the difference between ""I heard a word, so I'll guess the sentence"" and ""I heard a lot of the words, so I'll fill in the blanks, and I understood the sentence"", which is basically the difference if you're actually in the country (at least in my experience).

true,sdtp,cnty-england,Southern Fairy,"Several reasons:

My job is located just outside central London. I'd equate it to being from New Jersey and trying to drive into downtown Manhattan at 8:00am... Probably slightly less crazy, but still a long, tedious, traffic-laden commute to work. I *hate* traffic. I find it incredibly stressful.

It would be probably adding 70 miles per day to the mileage of my car - that all adds up and would eventually lead to me having a worthless car that I couldn't resell. I have a car, by the way, as where I live there isn't a train station and it's a 6 mile drive to the nearest one.

Convenience. Believe it or not, I would rather sit on a train for 50 minutes and read a book/catch up on sleep than have to be in the car, driving, fully alert, not able to relax or sleep or anything, for up to an hour... maybe more, traffic going into London is nuts.

I've figured out the price and cost, and the cost of driving (including insurance, more regular and expensive servicing to my car, petrol) is actually about £70 a month less than getting the train, but for me, personally, I don't think driving is worth it. The train is the lesser of 2 evils, so to speak.

I cherish my reading time every day. For an hour and a half I get to be someone else. I get to view the world through someone else's eyes. I can get wrapped up in the emotional struggles of fictional people and it can really help put my problems into perspective. For an hour and a half every day, I don't hate my job, I don't hate my commute, I don't hate my cunt of a boss, I'm not nervous about my finances or my future, I'm not lonely, I'm not sad - it's a form of escapism. That reading time is incredibly important to me, and it is easily the best part of my day - it's one of the few parts of my monotonous routine that I do not despise. It's ending in 2 months, and I will make room for it in my new life and career, and I cherish it for keeping my head above water.",0,1409056397,null,0,false,0,ck0tu2z,t3_2ej1zf,t1_ck0tu2z,t1_ck0tniu,null,1427352807,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,MJRocky,null,null,"The team has won, but Torres has largely been a disappointment. His form had actually fallen off before we bought him while he was still playing for Liverpool. There's even rumours that we rushed the deal through and didn't even do a proper medical. His injury played a big part in his decline, as he was a player that depended greatly on his physical gifts (namely speed) and now that those have dissipated his average technical ability is exposed. But I don't even think that's his biggest problem. It seems like his confidence has been supremely deflated for many reasons, and he struggles because of it. And since he keeps on struggling, it has become a bit of a snowball effect. 

Credit to him, he still puts in his shift but he just doesn't have the same mentality of a top striker anymore. I remember situations when he was at Atletico or Liverpool where he would take a defender on and shoot by three people and score, and now he won't attempt things like that. He might try to take people on, but stumble with the ball and give it away. 

I still maintain that when he doesn't have time to think, only react, he plays well. An obvious example is his [great finish in the Supercup last year](http://youtu.be/EnnnCWoE6Rc?t=16s) (caution the video volume is loud). There he doesn't have time to over-think, only react to the quick ball coming in. But most of the time Torres looks like a shell of himself for many reasons, chiefly being his knee injury and his waning confidence. But who knows? Maybe in a different league like Serie A he can return to being a decent player.

2. Start their own currency, probably backed up by oil. Not a great thing to back up with since it is an unrenewable resource.

* After discovering the advertisement, Madame Vastra exclaims ""The Game is Afoot!"". These words are from The Adventure of the Abbey Grange.

Almost. If Lucas goes (even if he stays) we need another defensive midfielder. We were killed in midfield yesterday. City probably have the strongest (physically) midfield in the world and they tore us apart. If Alex Song is available he'd be worth a punt. We really should be looking at someone of Khedeira's quality though. Can looked lost when he came on yesterday. He's one for the future and I wouldn't feel comfortable starting him in a crucial game.


&gt; Are you happy with the prices paid for players both coming in and leaving the club?

Yep. We've done really well. We could have got more for Suarez but after the biting incident our hands were tied. Slightly overpaid for Lallana but not by much and thanks to the home grown rules its what you have to do for English players these days.


&gt; Is there another position you would have wanted more depth in?

As I said earlier DM/CM. We also need a decent backup goalie.


&gt; Who do you think will still leave, whether it be a sale or on loan?

Lucas. I really like Lucas but his time here has come to an end it seems. He doesn't fit into BR's system and gives an infuriatingly large number of stupid free kicks away.

Suso will probably go on loan, there are too many players ahead of him in his position now.

Borini will probably go, be it on loan or permanently. He's just not quite good enough yet. He'd be ok cover if he stayed but he'd have to be happy with being 4th choice.

One of Coates or Agger will also go. If it's Coates I hope it's just a loan. He's a good ball playing defender. Agger is 4th choice CB at the moment.

Always look at income/expenditure on the same scale, i.e. a year, or a month, so you can see you've got £30K/year salary and £7.2K/year rent. Ideally work with after tax/NI numbers for the salary.

That way you can look at a daily posh coffee correctly as a £300/year expense, rather than a £1.50 a day cost that isn't worth worrying about.

If you're trying to manage your spending, look at sticking to say a credit card and restricting the amount of cash you carry, and for a week or two actually carry a note book (or smartphone app I suppose) to note what you spend money on.

The trick isn't 'having a budget' IMHO, it's getting into the habit of not routinely spending more than you need to or have good reason to. That's a behaviour/self control thing, not a matter of having a piece of paper/spreadsheet filled in in advance.

I think it will be as difficult for Liverpool getting into the top four as it will for Spurs this season. It is undeniably a weaker team this season. Most of their signings are of the same or lesser quality that what they already have. The one exception is Balotelli.

Suarez was not only a Bale-like match winner, he also brought great energy and creativity to their offense, and, he is a great team player. Balotelli will certainly bring goals, but he does not have nearly the same work rate, and is as far away from a team player as you can get.

Gerrard is not getting younger--and Joe Allen or Leiva will never offer the same commanding presence in this deep lying role. 

Their biggest weakness remains in defense. It is no more sorted than it was last year. I am not saying it can't improve, but as it stand now, it is still Pool's main weakness.

Spurs on the other hand offers a stronger team this season.

He has the potential to be great but getting there and consistantly being there is not easy. They are no doubt all great talents, but they have proven nothing so far. That's how we should look at it.

Also, if we want Suso to improve, he will need to play. He has great potential as well, and I'm not sure how he will fit in this year. 

Lastly, and the downvotes will surely follow, we should NOT even think about moving Lucas. He played in one game starting next to Stevie which was poor, but we know doesn't work. Lucas, in my opinion should start ahead of Gerrard there. It's a bit mental to think, but as a CDM, Lucas is better. Going forward of course, Gerrard is much better, but if Lucas is healthy, he will provide much better cover for the back four than Stevie would. We got scored on 50+ times last year. That cannot happen this time around. We no longer have Suarez to romp goals in every game. We need clean sheets, and Stevie playing as a CDM is not going to get us that. IThat's the turth. Gerrard should not be our CDM. If him and Lucas cannot play together there, try Lucas and Allen. I say Lucas cannot be sold because I do not see us buying a replacement with EPL experience in time. There are a few out there, but not sure it will happen. And Can is not ready, so don't bring him up.

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"There were a lot of emotions yesterday and some might even disagree with BR today when he says we were the better team up until they scored. But looking back there are tons of positives to take away. Ignoring the individual performances we looked comfortable in possession. Can anyone remember the last time our defense and keeper weren't panicking in possession when under pressure? Just watching the game again you see multiple City players pressing us in small area and our defenders comfortably finding their man higher up the field.


Then there is the mentality we have gotten over the last couple of seasons where we don't give up regardless of the scoreline, our players believe we can get back even if we are down 3 goals, is it a wonder then that I can't recall the last time we lost by 3 goals when supposed superior teams/squads get beat by huge margins multiple times a season. In attack our problems can be easily sumerized as a system we built over maybe 1.5 seasons being re-organized now that our former nr 7 is gone, for all the talk of our defense needing to mesh we have attackers who have lost a vital part of the movements they used to make and anticipate, the runs they used to see that are now gone. We will need to build both attack and defense, yet it isn't as bad as it looks, it only looks this bad compared to a team that had back 4 and midfield that were as settled as our attack last season, with their strikers being of such quality that they can come in and contribute respectably.


Positives for me are the comfort Migs and defense has with the ball at their feet, their ability to move out of the box and play high line with little panic, last season we panicked even when there was no threat. That BR has the balls to try to go to Ethihad to control the ball and stop their threat even if it lasted half a match also tells us where he wants to take the team, counter-attacks combined with high pressing style is not sustainable over a season if we want some of our players to play 40-50 games like other teams. We have to take control over the ball and the space without expanding too much energy, combining this with counter-attacks and high pressing when we lose the ball we can win over teams who aren't very organized with far less energy than we did last season. The more comfortable our players get with the ball the less we will see of the games against Norwich, Fulham, Cardiff etc. where scoring a goal meant they would push us into our box and we would have trouble stringing passes together. Even Real Madrid doesn't constantly counter attack smaller sides, they have players that can pass and keep the ball when needed, but then those magical moments when the smaller team tries to get their equalizer they have players who can take the ball and get 1v1 against the keeper. The best of 2 worlds as Heynckes Bayern discovered. 


That the team can go from sitting back against Norwich to pressing City away in the space of pre-season is amazing to me. People who compare this to previous seasons are being unfair on the coaching staff, Southampton game was horrible and it showed, but we quickly changed the plans and showed more composure against far better team. 


For Spurs match I'm hoping more of the same in terms of ball possession, with a better organization in the back and hopefully a better composure in the final third. We aren't likely to see the 4-0 or 0-5 but they are still adapting and we will have a superior depth from bench to change the game like City and Chelsea did against us last season. BR doesn't want to revert back to diamond I think (doesn't work well for a full game against teams that have great wide forwards), but we will hopefully see a proper wide forward on the left and hopefully Coutinho in the center where he will shine more.",0,1409060532,null,0,false,0,ck0vajo,t3_2emd49,t1_ck0vajo,t3_2emd49,null,1427352127,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

I think the point was more that a day out at the seaside used to be something that rich and poor could fit into a budget fairly easily, now it's something that has to be saved up for.

It's the change in what's a normal expectation in our society. When my dad was growing up in the 50s he went cinema every week, these days despite me being on over average income (and two income household too) I do have to stop and think whether I can comfortably afford the cinema.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; The whole point of a welfare state is so that people do not have to struggle to afford what you are currently calling 'luxuries', but are in actual fact necessities of a modern, civilised society. 

Sorry but no. The point of a welfare state is to support people during times of need - not to ensure you have enough money to get drunk / smoke fags all day. That's completely backwards. 

Christmas presents become more of a necessity as they’re not just for you – they’re for others who will notice if you celebrate Christmas without them. There’s a lot of pressure to ensure that doesn’t happen. 

You can however still go to a bar with friends and not smoke – or drink – if you choose. It’s not great, but it’s possible. That’s kind of the point – not to make sure your life continues on completely as before but that you CAN continue until you sort yourself out and get back in to work or whatever your problem might be! 

As for the rest of it – I’ve not been away for two weeks in Majorca this year (or last year, or the year before that) but do I feel excluded or judged by my peers, friends or family? No. I do not. Regardless I’ve already proven that if a holiday is a higher priority to you than smoking – cut back on smoking and save for your holiday. If it’s the other way around then do that instead. Better yet – find work and have the finances to do both, but where you’re wrong is assuming you should be able to do both whilst being poor. 

That’s the point. You’re poor. It sucks – but you need to change that before doing holidays and smoking and drinking. The state is not obliged to support your holidays or smoking or drinking and nor should it be. 

It’s not a grand existence to have to cut back – I never said it was – but demanding your luxuries be supported by the state is daft at all levels from poor people wanting to drink through the day to MP’s wanting a second home. It stinks universally.

Absolutely. Don't get me wrong, I make stuff that looks like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Bowl_of_chili.jpg) sometimes and it's tasty and filling and probably relatively healthy, but it's not chilli. It's stew. Your average Brit has no idea what chilli is - the perception is one of simplicity yet they'll still add every vegetable they've got in the cupboard to it, add virtually no spices, and cook it for 15 minutes before declaring it's ""ready"".

Chilli comes from the American South (AKA Mexico but don't tell Americans that), where cows were plentiful and men needed a good feed. In ye olden days when said cows were very plentiful beef was cheap in a way that beef has never been cheap in the UK, so you weren't looking at a meal which was 20% mince, 40% veg, 40% rice, you were pretty much just getting a bowl which was just spiced cooked meat, maybe with some cornbread or fried tortillas on the side.

It's a wonderous dish, but to do it properly in the UK it's actually relatively expensive. Most chillis aren't made with mince, they're made with cow meat from the front of the cow (What our butchers would call chuck and blade), in chunks, cooked not as a quick 15 minute meal but over hours and intentionally so that they can be kept warm for long periods and not get less tasty. They're not made from much *other* than meat though, and because of the huge expense of cow meat in the UK that makes for expensive chilli.

Chilli purists don't debate beans very often because it's pretty much done and dusted that they're out. Debate exists on things like spices other than chilli powder and cumin, whether adding tomatoes is legit or not, stuff like that. I can't be arsed with all that shite because I just like tasty chilli, but I do like it to actually *be* chilli, and dishes filled with loads of kidney beans and bell peppers are too different to be classed as the same thing.",0,1409061521,null,0,false,0,ck0vpko,t3_2ek5wq,t1_ck0vpko,t1_ck0pwt9,null,1427351892,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

Absolutely. We have depth in every position except GK (low risk) and CDM (we can easily adjust to play Henderson + Allen + other if Gerrard is out).

&gt;Are you happy with the prices paid for players both coming in and leaving the club?

I don't think we've overpaid for a single player. Even Rodgers' record signing, Lallana, only cost 25m, which is about market value for his importance to their team. Compare this to united, who haven't bought a single player this season less than Rodgers' record bloody signing (Rojo's fee + Nani's wages probably brings the total up to Lallana's fee) and we're looking pretty good. Moreno was an absolute bargain. Balotelli's fee was something else.

&gt;Is there another position you would have wanted more depth in?

Moar strikers. Nah, if anything a pure DM for the short term to chuck in if Gerrard's injured. Long term a DM is not where we want to be (probably want to be grooming Can for the role), but it'd be handy for the coming season or two.

Also if you need to exchange money with someone who doesn't use online banking (maybe an older generation?) it's going to be easier for them to just send you a cheque rather than you trying to get them to phone their bank up to set a transfer up.

Finally if you're closing an account with a company who don't have your bank details (eg. letting agent who you pay by standing order) they can just send you a deposit refund cheque and not have to collect bank details just for the purpose of closing your account (and also not have to deal with any complaints that the sort code or account number were wrong etc.)",0,1409062166,null,0,false,0,ck0vzht,t3_2ej1zf,t1_ck0vzht,t1_ck0uerl,null,1427351763,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,WillSpur,flair2,,"Completely agree with the comments on the defense. I really think that hole where Gerrard sits can be exploited by Lamela. He doesn't have the legs anymore and he isn't a defensive player despite what others may think, he is the football equivalent of a quarter back. Pinging balls across the park. I would bet a lot of money on Eric earning one or two free kicks from that area too from simply being brought down. 

He is not a Capoue type and honestly I think that team cries out for a true DM at times, but they sacrifice this by playing Gerrard which does of course have it's benefits. Throw in the potentially injured back line and the fact lovren and moreno are clearly not on the same wavelength or settled yet and I think we have every opportunity to take 3 points. 

What Liverpool do have, like us, is lots of pace. Sterling is unbelievably quick and even when you think you have him under control his burst of acceleration is so fast that it's irrelevant how well prepared you are. This is where capoue will be key I think in intercepting these type of balls. Sterling loves to dart off the backline and make those diagonal runs. 

I predict a game of counter attacking football from both teams, which makes me optimistic purely because I believe in our back line more than theirs (taking into account the injury and ""settling in"" comments I mentioned).",0,1409062308,null,0,false,0,ck0w1sl,t3_2emga8,t1_ck0w1sl,t1_ck0v5ag,null,1427351733,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

&gt;Fuck that. He's not British. He's an asian that happens to have lived in Britain. He has absolutely no connection to you or me.

&gt;Nothing that we can do now will matter if the muslim population gets too large. Unlike most british people, muslims vote in their own self-interest which is why people like George Galloway and Lutfur Rahman get elected. If the muslim population gets too large then they have the power to elect politicians who turn a blind eye towards or condone extremism. That's why curbing immigration needs to be our top priority. 

.

&gt;I don't see how my stance is close minded. The people who believe that britishness is solely defined by where someone was born, and that culture or ethnicity are irrelevant fail to see the bigger picture. By saying that pakistanis (for example) whose familes recently arrived in Britain are just as british as people who's families have lived in britain for hundreds, if not thousands of years is to say that britishness doesn't exist.

Until there is such a thing as ""Scottish citizenship"", which you can take with you when you move, the decision has to be for the people who've chosen to live in Scotland.

Say you were 40, and lived in Scotland for 39 years before moving away. Should you get a vote? What if you had decided to move away permanently and had no intention of returning - should you still get a vote then? What if you'd lived in Scotland for the first year of your life, then in England for 39 years? Should you get a vote then?

Say /u/DemonEggy was 50, and had lived in Scotland for the last 10 years. Should he get a vote despite spending more time outside Scotland than in? Should he get a vote if he's planning to retire here? What if he's here on a 12 month contract and then plans to leave?

Wherever you draw the line you're always going to find someone on the other side of it who feels disenfranchised.

It's natural to feel that if your self identity is Scottish, and you're not living in Scotland, that you're somehow being deprived of a vote. But you can find as many cases on the other side: your self identity might be Polish, you're living in Scotland, and you decided to stay here because you're bringing up your children here. Should you not get a vote even though you see yourself as unequivocally Polish?

How does that 'refute' anything? If anything it makes it even clearer that reporting on sexual violence by ""one of their own"" is considered bringing the paper into disrepute. When you've an alleged victim posting pictures of her bruised face, that's enough evidence to move the story beyond simple gossip.

&gt;It is interesting to note that he never formally raised such an allegation until he resigned, while facing further investigations into allegations of misconduct.

Yeah, funny how someone who was basically told ""drop it or you'll be sacked"" didn't mention it again until resigning.

Let's be honest here.....a great number of teams will look very poor against City this year. There is a reason City is one of the true favourites for the PL title this year...they are exceptionally good, rounded and deep.

This week i think we have as good a chance to take 3 points from LFC as we could hope for.  With their back line dinged up we could hit them hard and effectively with our front 4.

However no matter what we do we are going to need Capoue/Bentaleb to really play exceptionally well and help the back line out against Sterling/Sturridge (who i don't think our back line match up particularly well with) making those dangerous runs off the CB's and getting fed by Coutinho.  We also need our Lamela/Eriksen/Chadli to really work at closing down Gerrard, he may not be strong defensively but he can still pick out a pass and the attacking players of LFC really know all the nuances of creating space and putting themselves in a dangerous position for his passes from deep.

This weekend is a very good chance to take 3, but it is by no means a situation where we can expect a win. However this is a very good test for us....this is the type of match that good teams capitalize on by stealing 3 points.

true,w_is_for_tungsten,null,null,"&gt;How do you decide which GCSEs you take? Is it just based on your preferences, or do you take them in all subjects and then choose A-Levels based on your GCSE results?

You get a degree of choice,  I can't speak for everyone but at my school everyone did english literature, english language, maths, biology, chemistry and physics, then you got 4 choices, but 1 had to be a language, I did spanish, history, art and latin.  You choose A-levels based on preference and GCSE (to an extent) ie if you wanted to do spanish A-level you will have done it at GCSE, or some subjects want you to have at least a certain grade at GCSE to continue it.

&gt;I have heard people say that they needed ""two Bs and an A"" to get into uni. Do you still have to apply to universities, or can you go anywhere that accepts your A-Level results, without having to worry about applications beforehand? Also, does each department have different A-Level requirements, or are they generally the same for the whole university?

You have to apply to universities, you apply through a system called UCAS, and get 5 choices of university.  You put your grades in your GCSEs, AS levels (half of a levels) and predicted grades.  You also get a personal statement, a little similar to college essays but more about why you want to study the subject as you choose before you apply in the UK.  Universities then give you an offer of certain grades to achieve in the exams you take before you go, or if you already have grades it would be an unconditional offer.  Different departments will have different grades depending on the competitiveness of the subject and its difficulty.

&gt;I have heard that you can stop school and go to college at 16, or you can continue and do A-Levels before going to university. In the US, college and university are pretty much the same thing. Is college in the UK like a technical/vocational thing, and then uni is for getting a degree?

Now you have to stay at school until you are 18, college is where you study for a-levels generally, you might hear people call it 6th form, or 6th form college, or just school if it their school goes from 11-18.  No-one here really calls university college though.  If you don't go to university a lot of people do apprenticeships or other vocational courses.

&gt;Is there a large gap between privately educated students and publicly educated students? I understand that in the UK, public schools are the US's private ones and state schools are our public ones. Is that right? In the US, especially on the East Coast, there are several boarding schools that try very hard to imitate British boarding schools (they have forms, terms, holidays, and pitches, rather than grades, semesters, vacations, and fields). The kids who attend these schools are very often rich and privileged, but there doesn't seem to be the same disdain for private education that there seems to be in the UK.

I have never heard of forms instead of grades, I would call them grades.  There is a large gap I would say, but there are super famous private schools like Eton and Westminster who are very privileged and send lots of people to oxford/cambridge and lots of alumni are prime-ministers.  There are also grammar schools in the UK, more selective than state schools, but with no fees, but many were shut down.  

&gt;Do you like the uniform thing? It seems like most UK schools have one, but in the US, usually only religious schools do.

I do think lots of schools have a uniform, but lots of 6th forms/colleges do not.  My school had a uniform but I have no idea of the prevalence, I would say it is not an uncommon thing though.

&gt;Do schools have sports teams? In the US, each school has sports teams that you can join, and then you go play teams from other schools, and it's all a pretty big deal. I have some friends from France who say that their schools didn't have sports teams, but many students belonged to club teams that they would play for after school. What is the UK's like?

Yeah there are school sports teams, but because *American* football is obviously not as popular here is it mostly centered around football/soccer, but this isn't an area I know a lot about, sorry.",0,1409064257,null,0,false,0,ck0wxdu,t3_2emnem,t1_ck0wxdu,t3_2emnem,null,1427351323,10,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,10

For university applications, you apply in the October of year thirteen after you have your AS results. If you are applying for Oxbridge or Med then you will have an interview. Most redbricks don't interview. Around January time you will receive offers. These are the ""A\*A\*A""  type things you hear about. You need to make these grades in that Summer's examinations in order to confirm your place at the university. If you don't make them then hope you made the grades of your insurance university. 

College means different things in the UK depending on who you are talking to. It can be where you take vocational courses, AS and A2 levels. If it is in reference to Oxbridge, London or Durham then it is a subsidiary of the university which students are a member of. For example, Trinity College, Cambridge or Royal Vet College, London. 

There are four tiers of schools. Public schools are the old private schools with a lot of history and influence. For example, Eton, Harrow or Winchester. These are selective on academics and money. 

Then there are grammar schools which are state funded and very highly selective on academics. You have to score incredibly well in a test at age 10 or 11 to get in. 

Then there are normal private schools which are usually worse academically than grammar schools and are for students who didn't get into grammars or their parents don't want them mixing with the riff raff. 

And finally you have your state funded comprehensive schools. 

Almost every school will have a uniform up to the age of sixteen. In Sixth form, they either do away with uniform or have a suits only policy. 

Yes, school's have sports teams but students who want to play more competitively join external clubs.

true,_The_Editor_,null,null,"1. You take a core set (English, Maths, Sciences), and then pretty much get free choice to fill up the rest of the timetable (Geography, History, Psychology, Music, Physical Education etc.) so long as you don't have timetable clashes.. When I was in school (many years ago now!) you had to chose a tech too (food tech, textiles, woodwork, systems &amp; control etc.). 

2. You apply to universities before getting your results, and they'll make an offer based on AS level results, predicted grades, and interview performance. Each different course/department will set a different requirement for each student - typically they'll either specify required grades (e.g. AAB) or minimum UCAS points (an A is worth 120, B is worth 100, etc.). You can apply anywhere you want, any time you want.

3. Yea compulsory education stops at 16, though most people I know continue to 18. College is for A-Levels, NVQs (national vocational qualifications), and other similar level qualifications. I used college as very much a prep-ground (foundation 2 years) for my degree, but for others taking NVQs etc. it gives them the skills/qualifications they need to get the jobs they're after. 

4. Yea Public Schools are actually private, and the actual public schooling is State schools. There are also Academies now, which tbh I have no idea how they're meant to fit in with the rest of it.. You can get great state schools, and crap ones.. You can get great private schools, and crap ones.. Hard to fully answer this one tbh., as often (in my perception) those that attend public (private) schooling ate already privileged before they come out of school, so whether or not they attended public school doesn't change the fact that they might well be from a rich and well connected family.. 

5. Yes. For many reasons, but chiefly because the school uniform is the great leveler. If everyone is wearing the same clothes, then they can't be bullied for not having the latest trainers etc. 

6. Yes, but it's not as big a deal.

1. You decide which GCSEs you are going to take at the end of Year Nine  (Grade Eight, two years before the end of secondary school). You decide which subjects you want to drop and choose four GCSEs to take alongside the compulsory GCSEs which are - English Language (+ English Literature, depending on the school), Mathematics, Science (sometimes split into Physics, Biology and Chemistry, again depending on the school).

2. You apply to university through UCAS which is a non-profit university admissions service. You apply to five (I think) universities and then, when given conditional offers by universities after they've read your application (or not, as the case may be), you narrow this down to two - your firm choice and your insurance choice. If you meet the conditions of your firm choice you are automatically accepted into that university. As for your other question - of course! Imagine being able to get into a Robotics course with three As in Fine Art, Film Studies and Textiles.

3. College is, I believe, what you lot across the pond would call your 'senior years' of high school - Grades 11 &amp; 12. It can be vocational or otherwise, but you cannot get into university with GCSEs alone.

4. In a word, no. Privately educated students actually tend to get worse grades at university. Many people here feel that public schools don't provide kids with a proper holistic education - that is, state schools teach you proper social skills, respect, solidarity etc. in ways that public schools cannot. Having said that, I know a girl who went to a public school and she's actually alright, if a little sheltered.

5. I actually didn't mind it at school. It meant that the poorer kids who couldn't afford lots of clothes didn't have to worry about being singled out because they wore the same shirt twice in one week. Plus there's something to be said for making your own little alterations to your uniform e.g. tie length, untucking your shirt, wearing a jacket over the top etc. etc.

6. Yes, but it isn't taken nearly as seriously. The most common will be athletics teams, football teams and rugby teams. Women's football is becoming increasingly popular.

true,hitchenfanboy,null,null,"1.English and Maths are compulsory, as are Chemistry, Biology and Physics (though the latter three can be condensed into two GCSE certificates if you aren't too great at science). The rest depends on your school. There are various options and permutations including modern languages (typically French, German, Spanish). More GCSEs include: English literature, Geography, History, Latin, Ancient Greek, then art and design and other less academic subjects are available too, like Computing (ICT). There are many more which I will have forgotten. People typically do 9. 

You choose A levels from any 4 available to you at your school or college. Some may require a GCSE, others won't. They are typically anything you can do a GCSE in, plus more diverse subjects like Economics, Politics or Business. 

2.you have to apply to universities in the first year of your A levels. They then make conditional offers based on your academic record and application strength. you are not guaranteed a place anywhere, even if you have all the grades. This is especially true for the top of the table universities. Some require interviews. Universities often require certain A levels to be completed. You can't just rock up for a Chemical Engineering degree with non-relevant A levels. 

3.Education is now compulsory up to 18. some schools don't offer A levels. Ages go up to 16 and you then move to a ""6th form"" or College, for those between 16-18. Some do A levels, others do more technical/vocational qualifications which do not lead to university, some do both. University is University in the UK. A college is just for 16-18 year olds. Although some universities do have 'colleges' where the undergraduate body are split up into dormitories or are taught just in those groups. This is not the norm, however. 

4.State school in the UK are publicly funded. They are free. 94% of children go to these. There are then independent schools. These are typically not boarding schools, cost around £10-15,000 and are mostly middle class kids. There are scholarships available in most of them. The very top are public schools. They are anything but public. One of the most famous, Eton college has produced 19 Prime Ministers and countless other eminent men. Often very wealthy parents, often very privileged. These cost around £20-30,000 and are boarding schools. This isn't to say all public schools churn out the best and brightest. There are still stupid rich kids who do much better than they should because of the quality of their education. 

Are they derided? Probably. But the UK still has a class system where they would be derided anyway, and they in turn will look down on the plebeians. Such is life in Britain. 

5.Most schools have uniform up to 16. It's entirely normal. The idea is that behaviour is better as you are more accountable and recognisably associated with an institution. It also diminishes the socio-economic differences in background of the pupils, thus reducing shame and bullying. Everyone looks the same and should be treated as such. It's not even a debate in the UK. Uniform is a standard. 

6.Typically only the fee paying schools play other schools.  Mostly rugby in the autumn and Winter and Cricket in the spring and summer. Some state schools do have fixtures, but tend to find it more difficult as staff are civil servants and heavily unionised and refuse to give up their evenings or Saturdays.

However, you would think there would be a random selection of areas across Northern Europe with low gdp per capita as well if it was caused by random variations in local industry and population density - but actually of the 10 poorest regions in Northern Europe, the UK has 8 of them.

This seems to indicate there is a larger systemic issue of poor/deprived areas in the UK, which is supported by the evidence that we have higher levels of inequality of income and inequality of wealth in the UK.

My 2p theory would be that it's high prices and high cost of living in the UK, that means these areas struggle with GDP per capita **if** you compensate for purchasing power. My theory is if you were able to live on a Welsh income but somehow spend more along the levels of a Lithuanian you would have a comfortable life.

See here as well for full stats:

http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/1-27022014-AP/EN/1-27022014-AP-EN.PDF

from the chart you can see the large spread in UK GDP per capita (e.g. high income inequality, also go to the last page to see UK data)

edit to add: I don't know how they calculate PPS for the different areas, it might be on a country wide basis e.g. assume London prices = Wales prices

edit2: yep.

&gt;The PPS (purchasing power standard) is an artificial currency that takes into account differences in **national price levels.** This unit allows meaningful volume comparisons of economic indicators over countries. Aggregates expressed in PPS a re derived by dividing aggregates in current prices and national currency by the respective Purchasing Power Parity (PPP).

therefore the research accounts for the fact that the UK is more expensive than say Lithuania, but does not accout for the fact that London is more expensive than Wales",0,1409064790,null,0,1409065319,0,ck0x6ks,t3_2ej4p6,t1_ck0x6ks,t1_ck05zcl,null,1427351205,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Private schools and public schools are the same thing, both cost money in fees. It's a quirk of the language.  
State schools are schools run by local authorities (free)  
Academies are an entirely different beast that I know little about

1) There are several ""core"" subjects that most schools enforce. These tend to be Maths, Science, English. Other subjects are chosen as an ""option"". Some schools are set up in such a way that some options are scheduled at the same time, limiting the choice.

2) Different universities have different requirements. Most students will have their applications into a few uni's, and their requirement will be based on this. [UCAS](http://www.ucas.com/) as more info

3) Colleges teach 3 things (genreally): A-levels, NVQs and specialist qualifications. University is the step after A-level or NVQ.

4) Yes and no. This mostly depends on how the student performs and behaves. Having a private education does not guarantee Uni entry. However, once at uni, private;y educated students generally have an easier time due to the amount of preparation they received at school.

5) Uniform is actually quite good. All the kids at school are wearing the same. This helps cut down on bullying, peer pressure and parental shopping bills. However, custom uniform (school tie, blazer, etc) is massively overpriced (because you HAVE to buy it and only one place sells it)

&gt;4  The issue of race 

&gt;108. The vast majority of convicted child-sex offenders in the UK are single White men. However, with this specific model of offending, there is a widespread perception that the majority of perpetrators are of Asian, British Asian or Muslim origin. This would certainly seem to be the case from the major grooming prosecutions which have gone to court so far, but in fact both CEOP and the Office of the Children's Commissioner have found serious inconsistencies with recording of ethnicities and gender of both victims and perpetrators across UK forces.[238] Given the number of child sexual exploitation cases which have so far failed to make it to court, for the reasons discussed, this highly unsatisfactory situation means that it is extremely difficult to form an evidence based opinion on the true nature of what is still a largely hidden crime. Nevertheless, the perception, that grooming perpetrators are largely of Asian, British Asian or Muslim origin colours the attitudes of those working in the field, as well as the media and the wider public. 

....

&gt; 115. A factor that may reinforce the perception of localised grooming being carried out by Asian men against White girls could be the under-reporting of offences against children from ethnic minorities. Witnesses told us that there were cases of groups of Asian men grooming Asian girls[260] but these do not come to light because victims are often alienated and ostracised by their own families and by the whole community if they go public with allegations of abuse.[261] The inquiry by the Office of the Children's Commissioner also found that there was an under-reporting of ethnic minority victims of child sexual exploitation. The interim report noted that children from a minority background were unlikely to be identified as victims by police or social services. Instead victims tended to be identified by ""BME, faith and statutory and voluntary sector youth justice agencies,"" if at all. [262]

&gt; 116. Given the high level of debate around the issue and the fact that many of those involved in investigating the issue of localised grooming have warned against citing race as a key factor in these cases,[263] it is not difficult to see why the British Pakistani community might feel that the suggestion that this is an ""Asian problem"" is inaccurate and unfair.[264] There is certainly evidence of localised grooming being carried out by offenders from other ethnic groups. Tim Loughton cited cases involving offenders from central Africa.[265] The CEOP 2011 report cited a study from 2004 of a case in Lewisham involving Eastern European offenders, which followed much of the recognised pattern of localised grooming, including girls being passed to much older men by a younger 'boyfriend'.[266] The Deputy Children's Commissioner cited ""White, Pakistani, Afghan, Traveller, Gypsy and Romany travellers"" communities where children were seen as an opportunity for sexual exploitation.[267] **She considered that the race factor in the cases in northern towns was an artefact of local demographics, not culture.[268] This point was also made by Emma Jackson who told us that, whilst all of her abusers in Rotherham had been Asian and the victims White, in subsequent work that she had done in other areas, the ethnicity of the perpetrators would reflect the local demographics.[269]**",0,1409064861,null,0,false,0,ck0x7tn,t3_2emih6,t1_ck0x7tn,t1_ck0wbo0,null,1427351189,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

&gt;It says: ""While some organisations were consistently supportive in their response, overall child welfare organisations missed opportunities to provide a comprehensive, co-ordinated and timely response and, in addition, the criminal justice system missed opportunities to bring the perpetrators to justice.""

&gt;It also reports that ""activity to disrupt alleged offenders was developing on the ground, but this was not always followed through at a more senior level"".

&gt;""The early investigations of crimes and the prosecution of alleged offenders were flawed.""

That dentist became our family dentist. Our kid's check-ups were free. My husband and I paid maybe(?) the equivalent of about twenty-five bucks for preventative visits and less than maybe(?) fifty bucks for services (fillings).

The *only* problem I can remember hearing of about NHS dental care is that there weren't enough dentists in some areas so folks had to go to surgeries that weren't local to them. (This was about ten years ago. Things may have changed?) Maybe that's why they might want to encourage folks to get private dental insurance?

Here (US) we pay around $500/year in premiums for three of us. Preventative care is free and I think we have an 80/20 deal until we reach our deductible (not sure how much that is).

I've got a kid in braces. (Not sure what they do in the UK for orthodontics.) Our insurance paid around $1100 and we're paying the balance. The total was around $5200. This is not about my kid having ""perfect"" teeth. The braces will correct her bite and eliminate crowding (which helps prevent decay).

Either way (UK or US), I have been fortunate enough to have had/have excellent dental care.

Somewhat OT: I do wish we could ease-up on each other with the Brits=bad teeth and Americans=fake, ""perfect"" teeth. It's just not true at all.

EDIT: Oops! I've just realized that I may have misunderstood your post. Apologies! I was just sharing my experience. I hope I didn't come across as if I was directing anything negative your way.

EDIT: I need more coffee. That stupid bad teeth comment was much further down.

true,verygneiss,null,null,"It's worth pointing out that there is no 'British' education system, but rather there are several education systems in the UK. The GSCE/A level system is the English system, with different systems being used in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

I won't answer questions 1 and 2 as they are quite specific to the English system, which I have no experience of.

Q3. 'College' has at least four meanings in the context of the UK education systems:

(a) '6th form college' is the last two years of secondary school in England, and is generally a separate institution from the school you sat your GSCEs in (English people please correct me).

(b) In Scotland, a college is similar to an American community college, i.e. an institution where you study for vocational qualifications or qualifications equal to less than a degree.

(c) At some ancient universities (Oxford and Cambridge mainly), the university is divided into separate colleges which are essentially independent institutions. Other universities have this in a more limited sense, e.g. St Andrews and Durham.

(d) Some universities use 'college' to denote a large-scale academic division, e.g. the University of Glasgow has a College of Science &amp; Engineering, a College of Art etc., each of which contains more specialised departments.

Q4. At the university level, my experience is that there is relatively little difference between privately and state educated students. Private schools typically can afford extra tutoring for their pupils, but I didn't think the gap was that large.

Q5. I haven't worn a uniform since 2007, but I though they were generally good. They stop school turning into a fashion show, and they also let people identify you, which discourages antisocial behaviour and dogging classes.

Q6. In my experience (a normal Scottish secondary school), taking part in sport was quite common. The football and basketball teams were pretty good, and lots of people played football at lunchtime. There were also other clubs, e.g. mountaineering, Warhammer, painting etc. What we didn't have was hoards of people turning out to support the teams - it just wasn't the done thing. Parents would sometimes go along to watch matches, but there wasn't 'school spirit' like you see in American movies - taking part in sport was more important than supporting it.",0,1409064993,null,0,false,0,ck0xa1z,t3_2emnem,t1_ck0xa1z,t3_2emnem,null,1427351159,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4

true,sennalvera,null,null,"1) Some GCSEs are compulsory - you have to do Maths, English, at least one science and a foreign language. Schools may add their own requirements to that. Mine required at least one humanities subject. I did ten GCSEs, seven of which were fixed, one was a choice of language, one was History/Geography/Business, and one was a free choice. A Levels are a free choice but many subjects will assume a GCSE-level prior knowledge.

2) You have to apply to a university regardless of whether your results are pending or not, and the requirements will vary from department to department, largely based on demand. Unless its a top ten uni, when it'll be A*AA/AAA across the board.

3) Legally you can leave school at 16 but even if you were a prodigy and had got your A Levels by that time most unis would still not accept you. Insurance reasons, I think? Nearly all degree courses require A Levels. Those which don't tend to be from universities at the bottom of the tables. Vocational training is usually quite separate from university and happens in technical colleges, or 'techs'.

4) There is a gap, yes, but both the gap and the disdain surrounding it are more to do with class issues than money. Although attempts have been made to change it, public school alumni are still very overrepresented in top universities and in politics.

The closest thing I can think to an answer is that the Doctor ended up looping time at least once (I think twice, IIRC) changing the fate of Gallifrey multiple times.  That the War Doctor initially *did* destroy Gallifrey, which then got mitigated when All The Doctors! got involved, creating the Time-Locked Gallifrey that (our) Ten knows about, but only after forgetting about having been involved in its Time-Locking, which to him, happened at the end of the War.

&gt;4 The issue of race

&gt;The vast majority of convicted child-sex offenders in the UK are single White men. However, with this specific model of offending, there is a widespread perception that the majority of perpetrators are of Asian, British Asian or Muslim origin. This would certainly seem to be the case from the major grooming prosecutions which have gone to court so far, but in fact both CEOP and the Office of the Children's Commissioner have found serious inconsistencies with recording of ethnicities and gender of both victims and perpetrators across UK forces.[238] Given the number of child sexual exploitation cases which have so far failed to make it to court, for the reasons discussed, this highly unsatisfactory situation means that it is extremely difficult to form an evidence based opinion on the true nature of what is still a largely hidden crime. Nevertheless, the perception, that grooming perpetrators are largely of Asian, British Asian or Muslim origin colours the attitudes of those working in the field, as well as the media and the wider public.

&gt;....

&gt; - 115 A factor that may reinforce the perception of localised grooming being carried out by Asian men against White girls could be the under-reporting of offences against children from ethnic minorities. Witnesses told us that there were cases of groups of Asian men grooming Asian girls[260] but these do not come to light because victims are often alienated and ostracised by their own families and by the whole community if they go public with allegations of abuse.[261] The inquiry by the Office of the Children's Commissioner also found that there was an under-reporting of ethnic minority victims of child sexual exploitation. The interim report noted that children from a minority background were unlikely to be identified as victims by police or social services. Instead victims tended to be identified by ""BME, faith and statutory and voluntary sector youth justice agencies,"" if at all. [262]

&gt; - 116 Given the high level of debate around the issue and the fact that many of those involved in investigating the issue of localised grooming have warned against citing race as a key factor in these cases,[263] it is not difficult to see why the British Pakistani community might feel that the suggestion that this is an ""Asian problem"" is inaccurate and unfair.[264] There is certainly evidence of localised grooming being carried out by offenders from other ethnic groups. Tim Loughton cited cases involving offenders from central Africa.[265] The CEOP 2011 report cited a study from 2004 of a case in Lewisham involving Eastern European offenders, which followed much of the recognised pattern of localised grooming, including girls being passed to much older men by a younger 'boyfriend'.[266] The Deputy Children's Commissioner cited ""White, Pakistani, Afghan, Traveller, Gypsy and Romany travellers"" communities where children were seen as an opportunity for sexual exploitation.[267] **She considered that the race factor in the cases in northern towns was an artefact of local demographics, not culture.[268] This point was also made by Emma Jackson who told us that, whilst all of her abusers in Rotherham had been Asian and the victims White, in subsequent work that she had done in other areas, the ethnicity of the perpetrators would reflect the local demographics.[269]**",0,1409065304,null,0,1409065554,0,ck0xfk2,t3_2emih6,t1_ck0xfk2,t3_2emih6,null,1427351089,-19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-19

true,dukwon,null,null,"Just to start off with, education is devolved in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, with Scotland being the most different to the rest. I went to school in England, so I'll answer from that point of view.

1. I took 11 GCSEs. 6 were compulsory (English language, English literature, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology). I had to choose between French and German (or both) and between geography and history (or both). The other 3 I was free to pick myself. Different schools will do things differently, but English, maths and ""double science"" seem to be the absolute minimum.

2. People generally apply to 5 universities in their second and final year of A-levels. They'll know your results from the first year, and universities will make an offer based on those plus any interviews, personal statements and references from teachers. The entry grades are specific to each degree (we apply to do a particular degree from the very start, by the way) and are advertised beforehand. They can be a bit flexible and make you an offer conditional on getting ABB where AAB was advertised. If you miss all your offers, there's ""clearing"" where you can get last-minute places on courses that aren't full.

3. The word ""college"" has a few meanings in British English. If you say it on its own, it's a ""further education"" institute that may offer A-levels along side vocational qualifications that are usually named some sort of ""diploma"". Universities are ""higher education"" institutes with degree-awarding powers. 16 year olds used to be able to straight-up drop out entirely but I think the law has changed so they have to be in some sort of education, employment or training.

4. There's less of a gap than in the US, as far as I can tell. However, top jobs and good universities have a disproportionate number of privately-educated. ""Public school"" is a term that dates back before the concept of a public sector. They are a sub-set of private-sector schools. I think the more general term is ""independent school"". State schools are public-sector schools, but may have varying degrees of autonomy (e.g. academies, ""free schools"" and the few surviving state grammars).

5. Kids are shits, so having uniforms removes the possibility of bullying based on fashion or income. You can also tell if a child has snuck away from school.

Either I'm missing something, or the producers felt they needed Matt Smith to flat out reassure fans (especially those who think Smith was so hot and had more of a crush on Smith than liked The Doctor) that they are changing to a new actor (who I think is absolutely brilliant and is going to be wasted on writing like we've seen). There feels like there is no consistency with all of these things. 

I hope the season improves. I'm extremely excited to see Campaldi be The Doctor as he's not only a damn fine actor, he brings a lot of new elements to the character we haven't seen since the reboot. He has a chance of really bringing depth to the character, further maturing a character, and expanding on the entire universe in a positive way.

true,_The_Editor_,null,null,"I used to work in a biochemistry lab at my local hospital, so can give you a little insight into how it worked from our end:

1. Patient goes to their local surgery, produces blood/urine/fecal/sputum/CSF/other sample for their GP. GP fills in a patient ID form, detailing the personal details, required tests, and any relevant clinical details (e.g. *why* the GP has requested the tests).

2. All the samples from the surgery are piled up and collected by a courier at some point - this can be anything from a few mins to a few hours after the sample is taken. 

3. Samples sit in the back of the couriers van as they do their rounds, collecting from the surgeries - this will be another few hours. 

4. Samples arrive at the main lab at the hospital, and are decanted into trays for sorting. 

5. Samples are unbagged, patient details cross-checked between the samples and test-request forms, and ID labels/barcodes are attached to each - it could take upwards of an hour to get to the sample if it's in the bottom of a tray.

6. Sample request forms get scanned and booked into the mutlitude of pathology system software and lab systems, all linked to the unique code on the barcode label. 

7. Samples are prepped (typically centrifuged) and then sent towards their disciplines for analysis (Chemistry, Haematology, Immunology etc.).


8. Samples are then queued up in the analyzers, some tests are performed in 5-10 mins of the samples being loaded, others take 30-60 minutes of running through the machines.. Any results generated by the analyzers will be automatically uploaded to the various pathology systems in the hospital IT system.

9. Samples are out-sorted from the analyzers, and then taken to an archive sorter. This scans the barcodes of every sample it see's, and any with outstanding tests will get sent back around or put to one side for a biomedical scientist to check up on. 

10. Most results are usually out to the GP surgeries within 4 hours of the samples being received at the lab, however any which have been specifically requested can be process urgently and have the results telephoned as soon as they're available. Most of the time these results are telephoned back to the reception desk at the surgeries.

11. Once the GP surgeries have the results, it's up to them what to do with them; however the GP that ordered the tests will usually want to review them before they're released to the patient. Without knowledge of the usual reference ranges of the various tests that were performed (and other details, e.g. what medication the patient is on) the numbers themselves are pretty meaningless...

That's the *usual* route of tests/results as I experienced it.. *However* anything that was abnormally high/low would run past the duty clinical scientist for approval/interpretation, and if they deemed it something worth knowing about they'd advise the GP surgery to contact the patient ASAP... If it was out of hours then the Out of Hours doctor service would pick it up.. On occasion they have caused ambulances to be dispatched to pick patients up before they knew they were properly ill..

So in short, if you've not heard back yet it's almost certainly a bottleneck at your surgery.. *However* it's also almost certain that there's nothing drastically wrong else you'd have been picked up one way or another.",0,1409065676,null,0,false,0,ck0xlub,t3_2empva,t1_ck0xlub,t3_2empva,null,1427351007,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

true,MuffinYea,null,null,"&amp;gt;* How do you decide which GCSEs you take? Is it just based on your preferences, or do you take them in all subjects and then choose A-Levels based on your GCSE results? 

Some are compulsory, some are optional - English, Maths, Sciences, sometimes Religious Education (not all about religion, often involves ethics and PSHE-type stuff) and sometimes a technology of some kind (at my school the choice was between textiles, food, electronics, graphic design and wood/metalwork) and a language. Some PE is usually undertaken but not as a GCSE unless it is chosen. Then you have a few empty slots to fill for options - IT, computing, history, geography, art, music, drama, business, etc. Students will usually have had some experience with most of these before GCSEs are chosen.

&amp;gt;* I have heard people say that they needed ""two Bs and an A"" to get into uni. Do you still have to apply to universities, or can you go anywhere that accepts your A-Level results, without having to worry about applications beforehand? Also, does each department have different A-Level requirements, or are they generally the same for the whole university?

This is usually because they have received a conditional offer from a uni. They submit their GCSE grades and AS grades along with a personal statement, and can be given a conditional offer saying ""if you get an x, a y and a z at A2 you can have a place guaranteed on this specific course""


&amp;gt;* I have heard that you can stop school and go to college at 16, or you can continue and do A-Levels before going to university. In the US, college and university are pretty much the same thing. Is college in the UK like a technical/vocational thing, and then uni is for getting a degree?

It is possible to go to college and then uni. I think your last sentence is mostly accurate, yes.

&amp;gt;* Is there a large gap between privately educated students and publicly educated students? I understand that in the UK, public schools are the US's private ones and state schools are our public ones. Is that right? In the US, especially on the East Coast, there are several boarding schools that try very hard to imitate British boarding schools (they have forms, terms, holidays, and pitches, rather than grades, semesters, vacations, and fields). The kids who attend these schools are very often rich and privileged, but there doesn't seem to be the same disdain for private education that there seems to be in the UK. 

Yes to your second question there. I'd say the gap is more about economic standing class and where the school is situated than state vs public. I say this because some state school are as good as some private schools - but there's fairly few of them and they tend to be situated in affluent areas, so it could be hard for children from poorer backgrounds to get a place in such a school as they are so much less likely to be in the catchment area. This is just my personal experience - others have probably had different ones (please chime in).

&amp;gt;* Do you like the uniform thing? It seems like most UK schools have one, but in the US, usually only religious schools do. 

You know what you folks often say about guns being the great levellers of the playing field? Well, that's what uniform is. Almost all primary schools and many secondary schools have a uniform. I, for one, am strongly in support.

&gt;* Do schools have sports teams? In the US, each school has sports teams that you can join, and then you go play teams from other schools, and it's all a pretty big deal. I have some friends from France who say that their schools didn't have sports teams, but many students belonged to club teams that they would play for after school. What is the UK's like?

Both are true, but school sports are not a big deal at all for most. It's just a little after-school club. Those serious about a sport will play it outside of school in a club.",0,1409065717,null,0,false,0,ck0xmjs,t3_2emnem,t1_ck0xmjs,t3_2emnem,null,1427350998,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

In Poland, I suppose it's been 2006 since you can't cash your check, you can only make a deposit. It's only used by those who get checks from the US for some reason (working overseas, etc.) and it's pretty hard to find a bank that accepts checks at all.
Seriously. If you came to a bank with a check, the teller would probably be boggled, because it's something he's probaby never seen before.

Never have I seen a single check in Poland in my life, nor anyone using it or even mentioning it, except for Poles who live in the US and come here for vacation. They use checks a lot and that is crazy :)

It's just that we skipped the checking part and jumped from backwards socialist economy straight to card payments and online banking. And checks have never been popular in Europe, that's another reason for no chcecks in here.

If you are dealing with an older person who does not know how bank transfers work then you're inconveniencing them for a tiny increase in convenience for yourself. In fact you may end up inconveniencing yourself more if you count the time to teach said person how to do a transfer!

I'd say the need to send money like this isn't often enough that we should force everyone to learn online banking, but is still enough that we shouldn't get rid of cheques.

One senior officer suggested that some influential Pakistani-heritage councillors in Rotherham had acted as barriers.

Several councillors interviewed believed that by opening up these issues they could be 'giving oxygen' to racist perspectives that might in turn attract extremist political groups and threaten community cohesion. To some extent this concern was valid, with the apparent targeting of the town by groups such as the English Defence League. The Deputy Council Leader (2011-2014) from the Pakistani-heritage community was clear that he had not understood the scale of the CSE problem in
Rotherham until 2013. He then disagreed with colleague elected members on the way to approach it. He had advocated taking the issue 'head on' but had been overruled. He was one of the elected members who said they thought the criminal convictions in 2010 were 'a one-off, isolated case', and not an example of a more deep-rooted problem of Pakistani-heritage perpetrators targeting young white girls.

Mine was always more relaxed, just a black skirt, blue shirt and blue sweatshirt but my brother was at a different school and had the full blazer, shirt and tie regalia. I always liked my uniform; it showed I was a member of that particular school (which had a very good reputation), it meant I didn't have to worry about showing my 'style' every day, and taking it off at the end of the day always signalled time to play rather than time to work.

Christs Hospital School has this [rather unusual uniform](http://www.adp-architecture.com/img/projects/CHMP/ChristsHospital_Exterior_4.jpg) for [both boys and girls](http://cdn.thedistrictpost.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/WEB-Christs-Hospital1.jpg) that hasn't changed since its Tudor founding. As the school says on its website, ""In recent years pupils have been given the opportunity to complete a survey to find out their opinions of their iconic Tudor uniform and the results have been overwhelmingly positive."" Eton and Harrow both have their students wear [morning suits](http://sisterbrotherstyle.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/eton440.jpg) on certain days. It gives you an identity, and I like that. 

We do have some sports teams, but it's nowhere near as big as the American school version. School sports is always seen as quite hobbyish and amateur - just something to fill the after school time slot rather than something big and important and cool. Our universities don't really offer scholarships, so there's not that pressure to excel at sport, either. It mostly all boils down to the very British sentiment of 'don't try too hard'. Don't be a swot, don't be a sports star, don't be too much of anything. Be modest. We like underdogs, not big stars and that all starts from school age.

7 years of primary school (P1-P7) followed by 4/5/6 years of secondary school (S1-S6). The exams taken are National exams (roughly equivalent to GCSEs), followed by Highers (optional, primary university entrance qualifications, roughly equivalent to AS levels), followed by Advanced Highers (optional, roughly equivalent to A levels). Scottish students can go to university at 17, and university is free for all Scottish &amp; EU students studying in Scotland. Scottish degrees are typically 4 to 5 years long, and professional degrees (law and medicine) are undergraduate courses. All state schools in Scotland are comprehensive schools.

They literally had one of those old range cooker type things you loaded with coal which was your heater / cooker, no showers just hot water poured into a bathtub that everyone shared.

But when they came to the UK they managed to buy a three-storey terraced house in Leicester with three bedrooms (between 2 adults + 7 children). I know because I actually spent the first few years of my life in that house! (shame now it's just let out room-by-room to students by some shady landlords  - it would have saved me a lot of cash if I'd inherited it!)

Their standard of living in the UK rose practically exponentially and by the 60s when the 7 kids were growing up, they could afford their own cars and motorbikes and routinely took trips wherever they felt like. They didn't get paid a lot - but the money went pretty far. It was a fairly carefree time to be alive, when you could lose all your wealth one day, and be working for an honest wage and living somewhere the next.

I don't think things are worse now I should add - I can buy an iPhone or two with a weeks pay, when carphones came out for some people it would be the equivalent of a years income, but it is just a change from paying a peppercorn rent and easily being able to afford to go out, do things, go to the pub every day, eat out lots with change left over - to today where rent / fuel / etc. costs take a huge portion of my salary, and 'basic' things like restaurants, trains, or a day out are quite pricey, but I can buy a computer-in-my-pocket for £99...

Despite the ""obvious"" majority of perpetrators being white, the prejudice is still there.

EDIT: [Found some.](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/214970/sexual-offending-overview-jan-2013.pdf)

&gt;Demographic breakdowns of defendants prosecuted for sexual offences 
In 2011, males accounted for the vast majority of prosecutions for sexual offences 
(98.2 per cent). More specifically, males aged 18 and over accounted for 89.7 per 
cent of proceedings for sexual offences, with similar proportions for rape (89.6 per 
cent) and sexual assault (89.2 per cent) proceedings (see Table 4.2). 
9,042 defendants proceeded against for sexual offences in 2011 (91.2 per cent of 
total) were of a known ethnicity (see Table 4.4). Of these persons: 

&gt;78.0 per cent were White; 

&gt;9.9 per cent were Black; 

&gt;9.7 per cent were Asian; 

&gt;The remaining 2.4 per cent were of ‘other’ ethnicity. 

[This compares to national demographics of 85% white, 3.5% black, 7.8% asian, and either 1% other, or 3.3% other + british mixed according to the 2011 census.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_England)

So disproportionate, but not outlandishly so - probably account for due to terrible education and other factors.

2. Average witted, but can be charmingly fun and useful at times.  These tend to be fan favorites that people connect with emotionally.  Often they are a bit of a caricature.  Jamie, Sarah Jane Smith (before her own series, where she moved up to 1), Rose, Clara.

3. Dumb, largely useless screamers.  These companions are out of their element and pretty much serve only to be captured and later rescued.  Victoria, Jo Grant, Romana II, Peri, and most of the rest.  Frankly Donna probably belongs in this category as well.

In 2001, a young girl who had been repeatedly raped had tried to escape her perpetrators but was terrified of reprisals. They had allegedly put all the windows in at the parental home and broken both of her brother's legs 'to send a message'. At that point, the child agreed to make a complaint to the Police. The researcher took her to the police station office where she would be interviewed in advance in order to familiarise her with the place and the officer who would be conducting the interview. Whilst there, the girl received a text from the main perpetrator. He had with him her 11-year old sister. He said repeatedly to her 'your choice…'. The girl did not proceed with the complaint. She disengaged from the pilot and project and is quoted by the researcher as saying 'you can't protect me'. This incident raised questions about how the perpetrator knew where the young woman was and what she was doing.""

Also just to add on a different note, as no one has specifically mentioned it yet - when applying for university we apply for one subject, and all of your GCSE and A-Level choices are meant to point towards that subject. So if you want to do Medicine or whatever, you're supposed to have good results in all of the sciences and maths. A history degree application should show GCSEs and A-Levels in something like History, English Literature and I dunno, maybe Classical Civilisation or something. 

It does mean that English school students get funnelled towards one degree from the age of 14 when you're first making these GCSE decisions.

Page 93 of the report:

One senior officer suggested that some influential Pakistani-heritage councillors in Rotherham had acted as barriers.

Several councillors interviewed believed that by opening up these issues they could be 'giving oxygen' to racist perspectives that might in turn attract extremist political groups and threaten community cohesion. To some extent this concern was valid, with the apparent targeting of the town by groups such as the English Defence League. The Deputy Council Leader (2011-2014) from the Pakistani-heritage community was clear that he had not understood the scale of the CSE problem in
Rotherham until 2013. He then disagreed with colleague elected members on the way to approach it. He had advocated taking the issue 'head on' but had been overruled. He was one of the elected members who said they thought the criminal convictions in 2010 were 'a one-off, isolated case', and not an example of a more deep-rooted problem of Pakistani-heritage perpetrators targeting young white girls.

But you forget the Black &amp; Tans were Scottish as well and there were many Scottish settlers in Ulster.

&gt;Scotland consumes a huge amount of English culture and TV shows and what not, while very little goes the other way. 

Uhm, but this is the thing, in the context of British T.V where does England stop &amp; Scotland start? Most of our TV is shared. A large proportion of BBC reporters &amp; presenters are Scottish. The new Doctor Who is Scottish and so was the one before the last. Scottish people win on those crappy Singing TV programs all the time...

&gt; English culture

Which English Culture is this we consume? The Queen? Strictly Come Dancing? Is that what English culture is? You sing Rule Britannia in Hyde Park and in your Scottish Tweed and Woolen socks, stuffing your face with Scones (Scottish too) erstwhile not knowing Rule Britannia was written by a Scotsman, all like some regretful night with a mysterious Thai transvestite you met after one two many Scotch whiskeys. And then you have the gall to patronize us about a one way culture!

Don't get me wrong, I read Chaucer but I'll read Dunbar too.  

&gt; There is obviously some hatred and complaining, but it's more than that and something I saw in Ireland as well, they compared themselves to England all the time. 

Tell me my friend, what are we comparing? Is it penis size?

Here's an opinion which might change your view - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOm5U1Rsvu8

With the Irish its no wonder that part of their culture is engrained in their struggle against the British. But Scotland was a different matter and you must realise that Scotland was not nationalist in the 19th or early 20th century, we got on with Empire just like you did. But some people in Scotland want to govern themselves now again because the Empire finished long ago and all we are left with is ineffectual rule from a place that's a little too far from our doorsteps. None of this debate in Scotland is about comparing ourselves to England or complaining. 

You would probably be surprised that at least 50% of those Scots you believe spend their time 'comparing themselves to England' are great supporters of the Union, and want the Union to endure because they believe in our shared heritage and future. That's why a Scotsman wrote Rule Britannia. I'm sure hearing from their English brethren that  

&gt;  they compared themselves to England all the time. 

Is going to be very warming! Hurrah for the Union everybody, lets talk about English! rah rah rah.

true,TheBraveTroll,ni,Northern Ireland,"&gt;Health care doesn't work in a free market because becoming ill is largely random

Ex-ac-tly. That is my ENTIRE POINT. Humans are TERRIBLE at predicting where resources are needed. In the NHS, hospitals have to constantly predict how much of everything they will need. And in a system that is given a set budget this doesn't work. The point of private healthcare is that it will always spend money where it is needed, due to basic supply and demand. While what does the NHS do? Well it constantly has to predict and make-do. Hence why there is ludicrous waiting times and even times when they are greatly understaffed. Here in Northern Ireland we have had number crises in our major hospitals in the last year because the health service can never figure out how much money they need to pay for supplies, workforce and equipment.

&gt;There is also the problem that it will never be profitable to treat poor &gt;old people, in a private system they are left to die.

..........What even does this mean? Are you actually this childish and ignorant to think that ""hurr hurr big evil private company want to kill all people"". Having people die is BAD BUSINESS. THAT'S THE ENTIRE POINT OF A HOSPITAL. If a hospital receives a bad reputation, then it goes out of business and is bought over with new management; who will not make the same mistake because they are fuelled by the ambition of making money. 

&gt;No one does this in practice for obvious reasons.

Oh really? So the NHS is perfect? No one EVER meaninglessly dies in that system. Oh no. Haven't seen ANY OF THAT recently in the news.

&gt;Markets are great but there are cases they don't work, Natural &gt;monopolies like water is another.

Well no, the CEOP study was specifically called out by a couple of researchers at UCL. CEOP used their (UCL) study, focussed in specific areas, to make claims about the widespread prevalence of asian background sex offenders.

http://www.theguardian.com/law/2011/jan/06/child-sex-trafficking-racial-stereotyping

&gt; Researchers into child sex trafficking within the UK have warned of the dangers of racial stereotyping amid claims of a widespread problem of British Pakistani men exploiting under-age white girls.
&gt; 
&gt; Authors of the first independent academic analysis looking at ""on-street grooming"", where young girls, spotted outside, including at the school gates, have become targets, said they were concerned that data from a small, geographically concentrated, sample of cases had been ""generalised to an entire crime type"".
&gt; 
&gt; **The authors, Helen Brayley and Ella Cockbain, from UCL's Jill Dando Institute of Security and Crime Science, said they were surprised their research, confined to just two police operations in the north and Midlands, which found perpetrators were predominantly but not exclusively from the British Pakistani community, had been cited in support of the claims that such offences were widespread.**
&gt; 
&gt; Their comments follow claims that a culture of silence has impeded investigations into a hidden pattern of offending by British Pakistani gangs sexually abusing hundreds of young white girls.
&gt; 
&gt; The view points to the convictions of 56 men, all but three of whom were Asian and most from the British Pakistani community, found guilty of sexual offences involving on-street grooming. There have been 17 court cases in 13 urban areas in the north and Midlands since 1997.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; But Brayley and Cockbaine, whose six-month study was cited as evidence, said they were worried that limited data had been extended ""to characterise an entire crime type, in particular of race and gender"". They challenged claims that white girls were deliberately sought out by offenders. ""Though the majority … were white so too were the majority of local inhabitants."" Comparing the percentage of white people in the areas with black and ethnic minorities, their data, they said, showed ""black and ethnic minority girls over-represented among the victims"".
&gt; 
&gt; **They added: ""This challenges the view that white girls are sought out by offenders, suggesting instead that convenience and accessibility may be the prime drivers for those looking for new victims.""**
&gt; 
&gt; Conclusions from their study were cited in an investigation by the Times into the subject, which sparked calls for Home Office research.

A study of only 2 cases in localities being applied to the entire nation is nowhere near accurate.

true,TheBraveTroll,ni,Northern Ireland,"&gt;The NHS acts as competition in the market

No it doesn't. Because IT IS THE MARKET. Private healthcare in the UK is tiny in comparison. Private companies can't compete because the NHS basically controls everything in the country(whether that be facilities or equipment.);there's this huge thing called the 'government' that backs the NHS, and companies can't compete against it. That is a monopoly. And it doesn't force anyone to offer better service because the NHS doesn't improve over time. It remains the same because there is no monetary incentive for anyone to invest in it. For it to be competitive it must improve. But again even then it wouldn't work because of the before mentioned monopolisation. 

&gt;If private providers can offer effective treatment at lower cost then &gt;the NHS will even outsource work to them, just as it can - and does - &gt;for many other services such as HR, IT and other back-office &gt;functions.

Now imagine that private companies had the complete freedom to compete amongst each other and and IMPROVE their quality of care; without having to constantly be held back by the NHS for the before mentioned reasons.

&gt;ll operations, especially at that scale, have inefficiencies. I've not seen &gt;any compelling evidence that the NHS is less efficient than it's peers; &gt;indeed, the studies I've seen conclude the opposite

Thank you for proving my point. Private healthcare suffers under the NHS. Move along.

&gt;Do you really think that WalMart, McDonalds, Target, HP etc. don't &gt;have efficiency issues?

Not on the level of the NHS. When you go into McDonalds you get your product. When you go into Walmart, you get your product etc. Minimal hassle.

&gt;For basic commodities like pasta and curtain hooks then, for the most &gt;part, sure it generally works. Still, as I said before ...""Market failures of &gt;all kind exist in the private sector as well."" and ""This is simply untrue. &gt;It may be more frequently successful depending on the market, but its &gt;simply not guaranteed."".

Again you're not saying much by quoting what you said. Market failures exist, as I agreed with you. The point is that a private system will cope with market failures a lot better than a public service. Healthcare is a commodity. In economic terms it is a service like anything else. You make a transaction of currency and you receive a product or service. You can not argue against this. It is simple fact.

&gt;Ethical issues such as those raised by /u/Ed__

He didn't say anything. Words with little to no meaning.

&gt;Most of the evidence contradicts this view

.......where? 

&gt;as well as the much of the economic theory (vis-à-vis information &gt;asymmetry, positive and negative externalities, etc.)

Again you spout terms but you don't form arguments. I already told you that you can not argue that information asymmetry does not exist in the NHS. Having a standardised service that gives the customer no choice opens up the highest level of potential abuse of information asymmetry.

&gt; positive and negative externalities

That occurs in any economic format. It is not an argument. It is possible to get this in the NHS or a private company.

Children now have to stay in education until 18. Some schools take students up to age 18. There are 6th form colleges that just take 16-19 year olds for gcse retakes and Alevel. There are some colleges that do more vocational courses such as child care or catering which 16 year olds can do instead of alevels.

Remember that Ireland used the pound after independence before they created their own currency. With no currency agreement, it is most likely Scotland would eventually launch their own currency, probably on the model of Denmark (although our currency could be pegged to the pound rather than the Euro). 

However, the SNP have been recommended by a panel of experts including Prof Stigletz (http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-28929433) that they should seek a  currency union, which is why this is their policy and in seeking this as a first choice they naturally do not want to look indecisive. You must understand that a big part of the politics that you see on TV is a game (unfortunately) and if Salmond puts too much emphasis on a plan B then the media will depict him as indecisive and not serious enough. As he explained, they also would want to maintain a very hard stance on this going into any negotiations and not give a message of 'we want this but of course we'd settle for less'.

Could you imagine David Cameron going into EU negotiations and before the negotiations starts, he might talk on live TV about how the results he does not want from that negotiation could also work well for his nation? That would not leave him in a great position for bargaining. At this stage, negotiation will be the only way we can get a CU post-yes - we'll need to do some hard bargaining to get the monetary arrangement that two Nobel Economists believe is best for us. 

In the long term it may also become favourable to use the Euro. A developed small country in the Euro can be successful, with examples such as Finland, the Netherlands &amp; Belgium all being richer and having lower spending deficits &amp; debt levels compared to larger nations like the UK, France, Spain &amp; Italy.

true,powatom,null,null,"At some point in time, a heated home was considered a luxury. Nowadays, an unheated home is held up as a mark of poverty. Times change, as do our standards of living. What I'm saying is that what you are calling luxuries are not actually luxuries at all, given the context. Christmas presents, toys, books, etc - all of these are things which our society deems 'normal'. All it takes for division to appear (and I'm not talking about riots in the street, just general unhappiness, lack of education, frustration etc) is the perception that your life is not as good as 'those people over there'. Call it jealousy, resentment, whatever you want - but simply ignoring it does not work. Why do you think poor areas have bad reputations? Why do you think the 'chav' stereotype even exists? Feeling excluded is a major, common factor in the types of problems that poor areas have. Gangs of aggressive, disaffected, uneducated lads in their North Face tracksuits aren't natural features of the landscape - they're a symptom of wider, subtler problems.

I'm not saying that the government should just pay for every little thing people decide that they want, but I am saying that we need to seriously reconsider how we approach welfare because our current system, despite being considered 'too generous' by many, is obviously not curing the problems that poverty is creating. Why do you think the stereotype of a poor, working class family is one where they all eat shit, all smoke and drink, and barely ever do anything which could be considered 'self-bettering' such as actively pursuing education, work etc? If they're just lazy, then why are they also unhappy? Why do poor areas have more crime, more violence? I don't own a Lamborghini, but I'm not bitter about it when I see somebody else with one, because its not something I want or need. However, we constantly shove 'normal things' in everybody's faces, as though not doing X or not owning Y means that you're weird or different, and then act surprised when people who cannot afford those things complain about it or act out. 

If we're going to have a happy, functioning society, then perhaps we need to seriously think about what that society values as 'normal', and then stop acting surprised when those who cannot afford the 'normal' way of life start causing problems. Perhaps if we catch these situations early enough, we won't end up with bigger problems further down the line. Most people aren't naturally lazy, apathetic, and ignorant. Human beings are by our nature (mostly) inquisitive, inventive, and excitable. If we are identifying whole swathes of society as 'lazy', then surely we're doing something wrong? Perhaps if we give people (and I mean everybody) an equal footing, whereby the things we think of as 'normal' are actually easily attainable by everybody regardless of their income, then we won't end up with these issues.

Its less about capitulating to lazy people, and more about protecting the fabric of a happy, civilised, cultured society. Some people will always take the piss, but on the whole, people are happy to sacrifice to get the things they REALLY want. Imagine how bad it feels if every single little thing is a struggle to obtain. Imagine the frustration of living on the edge of normality - where you can kind of get the things that everybody else already has, but where it feels like a big pain in the arse to actually do that.

&gt; By far the majority of perpetrators were described as 'Asian' by victims, yet throughout the entire
period, councillors did not engage directly with the Pakistani-heritage community to discuss how
best they could jointly address the issue. Some councillors seemed to think it was a one-off problem,
which they hoped would go away. Several staff described their nervousness about identifying the
ethnic origins of perpetrators for fear of being thought racist; others remembered clear direction
from their managers not to do so.

That's in the executive summary.

The council and the police really don't come off nicely in this:

remove them from houses where they were being abused, only to be arrested
themselves when police were called to the scene.

Essentially you pay yourself the minimum salary offered tax free (around 6-7k before NI kicks in), and then pay yourself the rest through dividends. Even after Capital Gains and Corporation Tax you will be taking home around 75% of your salary.

However, I'm hearing about umbrella companies that can pay you 85% of your take home, although this might be tied to you making pension contributions. (An umbrella company is a company that employs you on paper, and then invoices you out on your behalf.)

I would find it very difficult to operate as an employee having being used to this set up for some time.

What I don't know though is whether or not this is worth pursuing on 14k... may be below the threshold for it to be worth it. Lower band of tax vs accountancy fees/cost of setup etc may tip it the employee route.

Looking at the online calculator here (http://www.sjdaccountancy.com/contractor_calculator/index.html) I did do some calculations, however maybe take with a pinch of salt as it's from an accountancy firm after sales!

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; What I'm saying is that what you are calling luxuries are not actually luxuries at all, given the context.

There is no context. Alcohol and smoking supplies are luxuries. You can absolutely live and function without them. If you become addicted to either then there is help available from a national health service that is fortunately available to so many people here where - abroad - they do not have one at all. You'd have to pay for help. 

Let's recap - you can become addicted to substances and then receive free help with getting over that addiction - all because you wanted a drink / smoke. 

That's a luxury. 

Christmas presents, toys, books - also luxuries to an extent - but with £100 a week you could probably buy one or two a week and still have room for some cigarettes and a bottle of wine. It's not *fine living* in truest sense - but neither is it a complete impossibility. 

I'm right there with you in being in favour of a happy, functioning society but a lot of that could be helped by education and reworking social structure - not just throwing more money at poor people and hoping it sticks. I'm sure they'd be happy in their way, which is great, but I'll bet you any money it would breed more people who live the same way. 

This isn't a 'the poor only have themselves to blame' post - but arguing that society as a donor should gift people 'normal' modern items like alcohol and smoking products is silly to me.

true,ZeekySantos,jack,Jack Harkness,"She probably is. 

But in Sherlock she clearly states that she is gay. Then a single man comes along and changes that. That's not writing with an open outlook of bisexuality, that's a female character literally being changed and proven wrong about her sexuality by a single male character.

In the original Sherlock Holmes story that the episode was based on, Adler's character outwits Holmes and escapes. In Moffat's adaptation, the only reason she outwits Holmes is because she had help from Moriarty. When she escapes she dooms herself to almost certain death, that is until Holmes swoops in and rescues her. 

She goes from being a clever character who can best Holmes on her own, to a damsel in distress who can only compete with the big boys if they help her. Moffat had no reason to change these fundamental aspects of her character from a 100 year old story, which is why I conclude that Moffat is sexist as fuck.
