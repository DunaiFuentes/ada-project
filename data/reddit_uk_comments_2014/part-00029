true,andrew137,null,null,"When Dzeko goes in behind the defence, there are four possibilities

1. (No Goal) Rose makes a legitimate tackle and wins the ball
2. (Probable Goal) Rose doesn't make a tackle and Dzeko likely scores
3. (Penalty and Send-Off) Rose tries to make a tackle but fouls Dzeko before winning the ball
4. (Penalty and Caution) Rose makes a tackle and wins the ball, but puts Dzeko at serious risk of an injury

The referee adjudicated that Rose had tried to make a tackle and fouled Dzeko, denying him a goal scoring opportunity. We can therefore rule out 2 and 4. The referee DID NOT rule that the tackle was dangerous or malicious (otherwise he would have called it instantly), therefore the fact that Rose came in from behind or the side is completely irrelevant. The referee has already deemed that it was not a dangerous tackle and hence, the only issue is whether or not he won the ball. From the replays, it is very clear that Rose won the ball whilst making minimal contact with Dzeko until after he won the ball (i.e. a proper sliding challenge). 

It is not Rose's job to referee. It's his job to make a judgement. He believed that he could win the ball and prevent a probable goal. He did. His judgement was spot on. The risk was that maybe he would miss the ball and foul the player - that did not happen as mentioned above.

Are we hoping to use our midfield 5 to control possession against City's midfield 4? Maybe we should play an actual defensive midfielder, then, instead of leaving space between the lines for Aguero/Silva.

9th Doctor (Season One) -

Pros: 

the show from this point introduces you to the show and it's history without the need for any prior knowledge at all here.

Christopher Ecclestone (as the Doctor) is a wonderful performer and brings serious dramatic chops to the show. He can make it possible to invest in The story boo matter how bizarre.

His relationship with Rose is beautifully portrayed.

Cons:

Effects can feel dated, this is something that'll either bother you or you'll just embrace as part of the fun!

Can at times fell like a show still finding its feet.

10th Doctor (Christmas Episode, pre season 2)

Pros: 

Brings a strong sense of pace adventure and a cavalier attitude to the show.

Often said to be the easiest Doctor to empathise with. The least alien.

Probably has better consistency in its writing, though again, this is highly debatable.

Cons: 

Expects certain knowledge in the shows audience by this time. 

Missing out on Roses developments with the Doctor.

11th

Pros

Plotlines and characters from previous era evaporate (though occaisionly referenced), making 11th a great jumping off point for new viewers.

11 is an immediately charming Doctor, easy to love. 

Effects have improved a great deal by this time.

PRO/CON - The show becomes a bit less driven by character and a bit more by plot at this point.

Cons:

9/10 are both superb

Some of the shows more 'meta' moments may be lost on you, especially in the 50th anniversary special.

Here is a good article from [The Swiss Ramble](http://swissramble.blogspot.com/2013/05/uefa-prize-money-rhapsody-in-blue.html) explaining the gulf in prize money between the two tournaments. Excerpts:

&gt;Each of the 32 teams that qualify for the Champions League group stages is guaranteed a participation base fee of €8.6 million even if it loses every single game. There is also a performance bonus of €1 million for each victory in the group stage plus €500,000 for a draw. So if a team manages to win all six of its group matches, it will get €6 million on top of the base fee.


&gt; ... Europa League.... Each of the 48 clubs involved in the group stages receives a participation base fee of €1.3 million. In addition, there is €200,000 for each win and €100,000 for each draw in the group stage....

&gt;Turning to the knock-out stages, clubs competing in the round of 32 will receive €200,000 each, clubs in the last 16 €350,000, the quarter-finalists €450,000 and the semi-finalists €1 million. The Europa League winners will collect €5 million and the runners-up €2.5 million.

It is the easiest place to jump in for new fans of the show, as the show had not been on the air for 16 years and the creators wanted a good jumping on point for both new and old fans alike.

That said, there are some benefits to having a bit of foreknowledge of the classic series, but it can be summarized easily:

The Doctor is a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, who has spent roughly 900 years traveling through time and space in his TARDIS (short for Time And Relative Dimension In Space). Being a Time Lord, The Doctor can regenerate when his current body is dying, meaning all of the different actors are indeed playing the same man. The Doctor's earliest, and most dangerous enemies are [the Daleks](http://static4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20111226141846/tardis/images/8/8b/Meets_the_daleks.jpg), a race of cold, emotionless mutants who have enslaved entire planets.

That should mostly catch you up to speed, and everything else will be explained as the show progresses. 

And just for fair warning, please don't be put off by the first few episodes of the show (I've seen many people try to judge it on its first episode alone). The special effects from almost 10 years ago are a little off putting and, as the show was trying to regain a broad *family* audience, some of the episodes have a more light hearted approach. But, the show's writing and special effects get much better with time, and by the middle of the first season you really get a strong hint of just how great this show can be.

Also, if you do get hooked on the show, try your best to avoid spoilers (many are posted in this subreddit daily) and don't look up too much on wikipedia, as there are some great surprises ahead of you.",0,1391058538,null,0,false,0,cf2h4jj,t3_1wix1x,t1_cf2h4jj,t3_1wix1x,null,1432170768,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

With the competition for top four so tight, this is not necessarily good enough to earn us CL privileges, but we should recognize that we are making clear, meaningful, quantifiable progress under Rodgers.

Eights wins, eh? That's certainly possible.

Y'know, I go back and forth on all this... If you told me back in August that we'd have 70 points by season's end, I'd be happy no matter if we got Champions League or not. However - as you've pointed out - with the top four race so tight, I think the bar has changed for me: This season might be the *best* opportunity in recent memory to snag that top 4 spot.

It's no secret that a Champions League spot is crucial. With Champions League money we'd be able to retain the services of a certain Luis Suarez **and** add a lot of depth to the team for the Champions League campaign and battle for 4th place yet again.

Cisssokho was horrible against Everton, the BT commentators were ridiculing him during the game, he had 60% pass completion rate and his positioning was horrid.

However (you knew there was one coming), there are certain things that can interfere with this arrangement. Weapons, poisons and diseases exist that can kill a Time Lord outright without the opportunity to regenerate. If a Time Lord is wounded fatally before their regeneration kicks in, they will die, and they can also elect not to regenerate for whatever reason (spite, in the one instance we've seen).

Time Lords can also be granted additional regenerations in various ways, mostly demonstrated by the Master, who has in canon both burnt through his alloted regenerations in record time and also devoted considerable effort to cheating death in a variety of creative ways. At some point during the Time War, the Master was revived yet again by the Time Lords, and bribed with a new regeneration cycle to help fight the Daleks.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"&gt; So, like you, I am appreciating and enjoying it while not getting crazy with expectations every time we win. And I'm not a doomsday-preaching-Grinch every time we draw or lose either.

Precisely! I won't fall into the depths of despair because we only got one point from Villa. And I won't start talking about the title simply because we thrashed Everton.

That goes for the transfer window as well. I'm not going to be depressed because we missed out on Salah nor will I think we're an automatic lock for a Champions League spot simply because we get someone like, say, Konoplyanka.

In recent years, perhaps we needed that *one* player, that Suarez, that Sturridge or that Coutinho. But this January window? It's not so clear (at least to me).

Sure, a lot of supporters want that DM but on the defensive side of things I feel as if the players have to come together as a unit - which takes time - as opposed to, say, an attacking player who can slot in a bit more easily (which is why I think you find us targeting attacking players this January window; attacking players who can make a more immediate impact a bit more quickly).

Anyway, I'm rambling a bit now but the point is we're steadily improving and if we improve a little bit with each match we're going to put ourselves in a good position. When we get a fit Enrique, Sakho, Agger and Johnson, that will surely steady our defense and if our defense improves even just a little bit and with the way score goals?

Let's not kid ourselves they are about to run away with the league having won 8 in a row (winning streaks like that are the hallmark of a title winning side) which included victories vs Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham, and Newcastle. The question for me at this point is whether Arsenal will collapse or fight to the end and additionally whether Chelsea'a recent string of good results will continue or whether they will regress to the mean. In the former scenario they fight it out with the top 2 for the title and stay out of reach but in the latter scenario they finish below Liverpool(where they've been most of the season so far) which is why I am pulling whole-heartedly for a confidence-destroying thrashing by City. As much as 4th is our goal we really want to finish 3rd to avoid an awkward qualifier against the likes of Athletic Bilbao, Napoli or Borussia Monchengladbach. This season Liverpool have been the most consistent team having no more than 3 points off our current pace of 2 points per game either above or below (76 points for the season for you mathematically challenged/lazy). This total *will* put us into the CL but in what place will depend on what the other teams around us do.

Also, watch out for cyclists, horse riders etc. They are required on roundabouts to stick to the outside edge so they may wish to cross an exit road to get to the one they want. When doing so they should make a right-hand turn signal (raise their right arm to point to the right) but a lot of people don't know this rule.

Oh, and if someone tells you to ""go straight over"" don't drive over the grass ;-)

EDIT ADDITION: Mini-roundabouts are treated the same as roundabouts as far as priority goes - give way (yield) to the right, but if they are just painted on the road people tend to drive over them like a junction.

**West Brom (A) - draw** - we're riding high now after the Derby, which is why I expect complacency to creep in - we'll go a goal or two down and then have to catch-up to earn a draw. 

**Arsenal (H) - win** - imperative we win. Arsenal have their own injury woes that have crippled their attack a wee bit, which is why I expect Gerrard will do fine in the DM role. Even if Arsenal do sign Draxler, he won't be bedded in just yet. 

**Fulham (A) - win** - 19th at the moment and I can't see us losing this one, even when factoring in complacency. 

**Swansea (H) - win** - Swansea are struggling a bit and I expect us to beat them 3-1. Jonjo Shelvey to score for both Swansea and Liverpool. 

**Southampton (A) - draw** - EDITED: three wins on the trot, very close to 3rd and 2nd in the table. Brendan and the boys will start to dream of titles once more and attacking Southampton at home should provide the necessary reality check, exposing Gerrard's weaknesses as DM. 

**Sunderland (H) - win** - following the Southampton wake-up call, I expect a sober and focussed performance against struggling Sunderland. 

**United (A) - loss** - United are on the way up and I believe their rise will continue with a hard-fought narrow victory over us at OT. 

**Cardiff (A) - win** - Cardiff are a bit of an unknown with the new manager, but I still sense we will win this one and comfortably at that. 

**Spurs (H) - win** - I don't quite see what Sherwood can do to stop the SAS onslaught at Anfield. They can't play their attacking game here, as they will be too exposed. I expect Sherwood will try to play a cautious game, a style with which both he and the team he manages are unfamiliar. I don't expect another rout, but I think Tottenham will be too confused and sloppy to cope. 3-1 Liverpool. 

**West Ham (A) - loss** - Carroll back, a physical 'English' side - Liverpool's Achilles' heel. West Ham to win 2-0; Rodgers to be baffled by the result. 

**City (H) - loss** - we'll give it our best, which is why we'll only lose 1-2. 

**Norwich (A) - 12-0 win**, Suarez scores a triple hat-trick. 

**Chelsea (H) - draw** - Mourinho's Chelsea do not concede goals lightly. They don't score them either though, so I expect this to be a dull but tense low-score draw. Flanagan to give Torres a wedgie mid-way through the second half. 

**Palace (A) - win** - it's a Pulis side, so it'll be tough, but I think will grind out a 2-1 win. 

**Newcastle (H) - win** - last game of the season, 70 points, Liverpool are riding high. Depending on what the table looks like, this will either be a nervous and careful narrow victory or a celebratory rout, welcoming European football back to Anfield. Little European flag confetti to fall from the sky at full time, You'll Never Walk Alone ringing through the stands, John Henry smiling smugly and satisfied. Brendan Rodgers' words will fail him as he'll simply have no superlatives left after a season of 'brilliant' and 'outstanding' performances. Barcelona to bid £95 million for John Flanagan over the summer, an offer that is instantly dismissed as 'insulting'. 

76 points in total. Should be doable. 

Maybe it is good I am not a gambling man...  :/

Your criticisms are absolutely valid - I tend not to include sources for the articles on Darkerside. That doesn't mean that I don't research what I write, and the final decision not to include citations took me about a year to make. Let me explain why, and then I'm quite happy to take further comments!

Firstly, I just don't have time (around a real job and a family) to properly cite everything I read. I remember stuff, and I'll check back to make sure what I remember is correct, but if I then insisted everything I write included links out then I'd publish about one article a year.

Next, inline citations don't fit in with what I want Darkerside to be. I try to present sometimes pretty dull issues in a manner that's bearably readable, as if I was talking to you over a coffee. I wouldn't lob research at you face-to-face, and so I don't include it in my writing unless it's absolutely vital (so I *did* include detailed citations in the thing I wrote about Glasgow Park Management Rules, because I needed to explain some of the legal guff before the conclusion I presented made sense). I'm not trying to be a journal or an encylopedia; I'm trying to be a faintly amusing site to read about once a week over lunch that maybe prompts you to do your own reading into a subject. If that isn't what you want then I'm sorry to not have you as a reader, but I accept I can't please everyone.

In this particular case I tried desparately not to ""wade into the helmet debate"". It's dull, it wasn't relevant to the story, and no-one should base decisions on their personal safety on what someone else says on a blog (especially one that doesn't cite evidence!). As you've done, people should read around, look at research, and form their own decisions. The facts I presented I hope are absolute - I certainly didn't say that helmets are of no safety benefit.

I hope that explains a bit about why I write how I do. If you're around Glasgow feel free to collar me on the street and chat about it - I'm the guy on the white recumbent.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There are many reasons why any piece of art holds value. And this value is not set in stone. Ten years from now that piece could be worth nothing. It is based heavily on who the artist is and what they were feeling when they made it, how it influences the art world, how it makes you feel etc. Compare it to a song. To you, a popular song might be boring and shitty, and you might even think 'I could make that!'. It doesn't mean others don't appreciate it, or that it hasn't inspired other musicians or even redefined the industry. Just because at face value it seems simple doesn't mean that it hasn't made a real impact among other artists, or that the original artist didn't pour their whole self into it, for example something by Bob Dylan. Its simple, but to some can be very thought provoking. Now imaging that song only existed as one copy. This popular song that many people love can only be heard in one place from one hard copy. Would that original copy be valuable? Probably very valuable. The reason music isn't valued like this is because it can be heard anywhere. Pieces of art can have the same impact artistically as a song, but the difference is that there is only one copy to be appreciated. So just because you don't appreciate it doesn't mean it isn't a valuable thing. There are very good reasons as to why that piece is worth that much money, and the fact that you or I don't like it or think it is crap won't change that. The artist didn't jut decide it was worth 10 million.

I'd also argue that car owners are a lot less responsible with their big metal death boxes on wheels, given that the rate of car deaths in 2010 per 100,000 people was 2.75, but the rate of unintentional accidents involving firearms in the same year was 0.01 per 100,000. (Before you say that those numbers are *because* of the gun laws, the pre-1997 ban had similar numbers - 0.00 in 1996 and 0.02 in 1995).

What I'm basically saying is that if you want to apply some logic to one thing, you have to apply it to other things:

""Guns should be banned because they can be used to kill people"", then why not ""Cars should be banned because they can be used to kill people""?

""Cars have an intended purpose other than killing people (transportation)"", then why not, ""Guns have an intended purpose other than killing people (sport)""?

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hi Rob, thanks for the reply, apologies if I sounded like a grumpy bastard but it's an issue that I try so hard not to care about but for some reason helmet use evokes a response in me. I appreciate your article is supposed to be an combination of opinion, entertainment and fact but you write in a persuasive way and I suppose I felt you should have more responsibility to encourage positivity and education about helmet use, but it's your article at the end of the day. Of course people shouldn't base their views on personal safety on an unsourced blog but people do, people are persuaded by what they read even if not consciously especially if they didn't hold an opinion before reading your article.

While you say you didn't say that helmets are of no safety benefit you do say that ""None of the research has found any evidence that people who regularly wear cycle helmets get killed or seriously injured any less often than people who don’t."" I think you're trying to make the point that wearing a helmet won't improve your chances of being in a crash but as you know it will have a statistically great chance of a serious head injury so I'm not sure what statements like this serve other than to discourage helmet use.

You also claim in your reply that people should be stimulated by your article to make further research of their own but in the article you state ""There is no worthwhile evidence either way"" when a whole host of quality research and evidence exists.

Anyway I don't suppose there is much point in trying to pick apart your article further but maybe in the future you might keep in mind that you do have some responsibility as a writer and as someone who is going to shape people's opinions and maybe you could use that influence to encourage a more positively balanced view of helmet use.

If we were to make the playoffs this year and get promoted then the team is really unprepared for the premier league and we would go straight down. Look at Crystal Palace, the signed a bunch of players when they got promoted and are going to be close to relegation.

Due to her not being able to do that, she then opted for ""Voluntary Refusal of Food and Fluids"" when she was meant to get a feeding tube to help her swallow - she refused to let them put the tube in, so that she would die of starvation and dehydration. It's the only legal method of euthanasia in the UK at the minute, as doctors are allowed to help in terms of giving pain medication and all that because it's a ""refusal of treatment"" rather than an active way of ending your life. It's a horrible, painful experience for the person doing it but it was quicker than her prognosis, and she was actually completely conscious and with it for about 18 days, during which she would frequently write ""you wouldn't put a dog through this"", because you wouldn't, you would put it down.",0,1391082029,null,0,false,0,cf2mm2v,t3_1wjnks,t1_cf2mm2v,t1_cf2m0jd,null,1432173430,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23

Assisted suicide has a very decent principle and as such should eventually be allowed. Simply because we can take our own lives if we want to (suicide) but can't if we don't have controls over our body.

The same principle came with the idea of abortion in UK. Of course it is good to have possibility for an abortion. The law is actually quite good about it. The issue is its implementation in the real life. You can go to a doctor and say ""I don't want to have that child"" and have an abortion. No reason to provide is necessary at many places (especially private clinics). That is why there are ""gender abortions"" (wanting girl/boy, not having it so an abortion) or as a form of contraceptive, where some people don't care they can get pregnant and even though no social, economical nor mental reasons exist they still go ahead with the abortion.

When I raised an issue I meant it would be risky to have assisted suicide implemented in UK (judging on abortion implementation) without having plenty of cases where such would be misused.

**Original Version:**

""The home secretary is seeking powers to strip terror suspects of UK citizenship even if it leaves them stateless.

The amendment to the Immigration Bill could see naturalised citizens whose conduct is deemed ""seriously prejudicial"" lose their nationality.

People with dual nationality can already lose their British passports.

It comes as the government faces backbench rebellions over the rights of foreign criminals and Romanian and Bulgarian migrants.

BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says critics of coalition policy on the Conservative back benches are concerned that the Immigration Bill does not go far enough and believe there has been a concerted attempt to deprive the Commons of enough time to discuss their amendments.

Home Secretary's Theresa May's last-minute addition to the list of about 50 government amendments to the Immigration Bill would not apply to people born in UK.

The Home Office insists the powers would be used sparingly and in strict accordance with the UK's international obligations. It also has the support of the Lib Dem leadership, who accept it would only apply in a tiny number of cases.

Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ""Citizenship is a privilege, not a right. These proposals will strengthen the home secretary's powers to ensure that very dangerous individuals can be excluded if it is in the public interest to do so.""

But the legal charity Reprieve has described the plan as an ""alarming development"" saying it would give the home secretary power to ""tear up people's passports without any need for the kind of due process"".

The home secretary's move follows a UK Supreme Court ruling in October that said she was wrong to take away citizenship from a terror suspect who became British after leaving Iraq in 1992 as a refugee, leaving him stateless. The Home Office is appealing against the decision in favour of Hilal Al-Jedda, who now lives in Turkey.

Family life
The prime minister's spokesman has defended the government's stewardship of the parliamentary timetable, pointing out that it is for the Speaker to decide the order in which amendments are debated.

The proposal to extend restrictions on Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants to 2018, tabled by MP Nigel Mills, has garnered the signatures of 70 backbenchers, but is not expected to win enough votes to result in a government defeat.

Conservative ministers, the Lib Dems and Labour are all expected to oppose it.

It was originally tabled before the immigration controls ended on 1 January.

However, the legislation has been on hold since 19 November, fuelling speculation that it had been delayed to thwart the rebellion.

Ministers denied the charge, and PM David Cameron said the UK was ""not allowed"" to extend the restrictions further under current EU law.

A second amendment, tabled by MP Dominic Raab, would remove the right of foreign criminals facing automatic deportation to make an appeal based on their right to a family life in the UK.

Labour MP Mark Lazarowicz said in Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday that ""dozens"" of Conservative backbenchers were pushing for changes ""which everyone knows will be totally incompatible with the European treaties"".

""The prime minister has given concession after concession to his anti-Europeans,"" he continued.

""When will he finally learn that they will never be satisfied with anything but British withdrawal from the European Union?""

But Mr Cameron said: ""We need to make sure that people cannot come to Britain and abuse our health service and get rights to council or other housing or bank accounts or driving licences if they have no right to be here.

""These are all very good changes and I hope that we won't delay too much before passing this important bill.""

Mr Cameron said there was nothing ""anti-European"" about the bill.

It aims to force private landlords to quiz tenants about their immigration status and restrict access to bank accounts for people in the country without permission.

A requirement is also included for some migrants to make a financial contribution to the National Health Service.

It would also streamline the appeals process in immigration cases.",0,1391082209,null,0,false,0,cf2mn2d,t3_1wjab8,t1_cf2mn2d,t3_1wjab8,null,1432173443,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I enjoy not having any proper responsibilities or commitments and being able to live on impulse is pretty good.

But at the same time I hate my university and dislike most people on my course. I've not once felt challenged at uni which results in a poor work ethic and laziness. But it's my own fault, I didn't put the effort into my A levels/didn't want to move away from where I am so I ended up at a second rate university.

I'm really worried about future job prospects, I genuinely haven't a clue what I'm supposed to do once university ends and I worry that whatever it is, I'll always feel like it's not good enough because I was lazy as a kid.

Does he have any idea how long teachers work already?  
They don't just turn up in a morning, deliver off-the-cuff lessons until 3pm, then bog off home and sit in front of the TV for the rest of the day.

About half a teacher's time is lesson planning, marking, CPD and all the other admin stuff they have to do.

And schools would have to pay teachers for those extra hours, probably employing extra teaching staff to cover the afternoon shifts so that teachers working earlier in the day have time for planning.

Children getting home from school at about 5-6pm would have very little time left over for other activities which they currently do after school, like sport, music, or just playing outside with friends.

Just a word of warning if you go through comparison sites like Late Rooms that for any cancellations etc have to be done through the website and not the hotel. They'll likely have a booking fee too. Always compare the third party price with the price on the hotels actual website or on the phone so you can see if it's cheaper like for like, if not ring the actual hotel and speak to in house reservations who can normally pull some negotiation. 

From my experience the least pain in the arse websites I had to deal with were Laterooms.com and bookings.com. Their bookings were always correct and they rarely fucked it up. However I dreaded Trivago and TripAdvisor calls because they created an entire world of issues like booking a single bed for 2 people or booking the wrong country on one occasion.

&gt;Don't you see ANY difference whatsoever between a gun and a car?

Of course I do. Straw man argument.

&gt;Like something along the lines that guns were invented for killing and cars for driving people around? 

It doesn't matter what they were invented for, it matters what you use them for. Shooting a projectile at a paper target harms nobody.

&gt;How many guns in total in the world are used for sporting purposes?

Why do the numbers here matter? Why should what somebody else uses something for have any impact on how *I* use it?

&gt;You can also live pretty as usual without a gun. It's very hard these days to not use any form of transport to get around.

&gt; to not use ***any*** form of transport

We're just talking about cars here. There are plenty of other forms of transport that could be used to reduce road deaths. It's perfectly possible to live life without a car.

And besides, is that what we should be restricted to, *only* what we need to live and devoid of hobbies or entertainment? I'd argue that one needs enjoyment in order to live.

&gt;I really struggle to understand why people defend something as idiotic as possession of guns and comparing it to everyday objects like cars or football.

They're only ""everyday"" items because they are popular. I've never been a fan of the law being a popularity contest, it leads to bad things. I bet more people would be in favour of banning football to curb hooliganism if only a minority of people played/watched it.

&gt;MAIN purpose of guns is to KILL.

Absolutely false. Possibly true for some military weapons, but you're lumping all guns together. If you look at something like this:

So basically your argument goes along the lines that a sport should be equal with all other aspects of life. Even if that sport uses lethal and deadliest weapon the law should be constructed in a way it allows people to keep sport tools like guns just because they want to.

You really are pushing your arguments into a pointless void. I don't mind guns used for sports. I mind keeping those guns at homes as they bring extra threat, which you don't see with most other things in sport or daily life. You just can't compare cars and guns together as it doesn't make any sense. As a matter of fact, I can even defend that argument and tell you that some cars are not allowed for public roads and used only for sports - showing correlation with guns used only for sport and guns which don't have to be kept at home.

And yes, I'm lumping all guns together as their main reason of existence is killing people, whether at war or on streets. Reducing number of weapons subsequently reduced risk of their possible inadequate use. In any case, most people don't need a gun kept at home.

But there was a fair amount of frustration from a number of people that Sherwood chose to start him and leave Capoue on the bench.  Against a team like city that can shred any team in the league exposing the defense seemed like a very naive tactical decision.

During the match Bentaleb was shaky, but i agree not the worst on the pitch.  But with how our midfield got bowled over Sherwood's decision to play a young player who was over-matched in the middle seems like it could have been an easy fix.

I would also agree with Lennon and Siggy being the disappointments. Lennon with the poor game was unfortunate but honestly this was never going to be a match that played in his favor to do well.  Siggy starting was a mistake, he is very poor on the wing in general and on the wing against a team like City means he is being setup to fail, and as it turns out he did so.

Bentaleb may be catching the heat but i think more people are unhappy with our tactical choices overall and Bentaleb is the easiest one to highlight. ",0,1391087424,null,0,false,0,cf2nm3u,t3_1wjv74,t1_cf2nm3u,t3_1wjv74,null,1432173926,11,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,11

No, answering the obvious ones and ignoring the ones that are already common knowledge in the hope of educating someone that blatantly hasn't been in the same position or has an apparent interest in ignoring the reality. I don't have to refute much at all, really - most of what I've said is common knowledge, meaning it's up to *you* to prove otherwise.

&gt;MSO became dominant because they had an OS to go with it, and as I said before people adapted to it, so it's not correct to think that any replacement must be absolutely identical.

No, MSO became dominant because Wordpefect and the rest spent far too long pretending that Windows was an option instead of the only game in town. By the time they realised the game was up, it was too late.

&gt;so it's not correct to think that any replacement must be absolutely identical.

It didn't - it just had to run under Windows. Remember,these were the days where if WP 5.1 didn't have a driver for your printer, you couldn't print.

&gt;And that's a very revisionist view of the netscape vs Ie battle.

I don't see how - and I don't remember it being a battle in any sense of the word. The prospect of $30 vs. free made it a no-brainer for most (if not all). Nobody decided to go back to giving Netscape away for free, and the rest is history.

&gt;I think you'll find MS were found guilty of abusing their dominant position. 

Everyone else was perfectly capable of offering a free equivalent. They didn't. MS have certainly abused their position in several instances, but this isn't one of them - I could just as easily argue that IE became the only game in town because everyone else that could have offered a good alternative was too greedy.

&gt;All of which makes your last paragraph really shrill. 

In your opinion. In the corporate world, it's a reasonable expectation.

&gt;It doesn't have to be compatible with absolutely everyone 

Sorry, but it does. You can't pretend the overwhelmingly dominant player doesn't exist just because you don't like it.

&gt; seem to recall WP is/was popular for legal work up till quite recently

I've contracted for three different law firms...they must have been the exceptions. When I see a contract job offered that actually mentions it by name, it'll be of significance.

&gt;Money going to licencing disappears out of the country, money spent on development goes into the local economy and taxation.

That's a daft statement. Money spent on HP/ IBM equipment goes out of britain. Money spent on SAP goes out of britain. Money spent on development is going to be a) more if you want to do it open-source, and b) remaining in the country regardless. Money spent on licenses is money saved off of trying to build a free equivalent, and is actually a fraction of the overall budget. And *that's* before we get to service companies like Capita/ Serco/ Atos, that do a lot of development overseas anyway, with one programmer still in the UK so that they can say they're not offshoring. 

&gt;Give it a rest

Why? Is the reality that painful? I do it for a living, and have been giving you examples from real-world situations and appraisals as examples as why not just I, but the *vast majority* have come to the same conclusion.

An assumption based on your part, not a statement made by me - but evangelise if you like, it's done the linux desktop *so much good* in the past 20 years. Open source has a role in lots of areas - just not this one - but you'll have to talk to someone that hasn't done exactly these kind of appraisals of alternatives instead of acting butthurt that the vast majority don't agree with you if you want to carry on asserting that everyone else is just wrong.",0,1391088265,null,0,1391089776,0,cf2nt4g,t3_1wghfs,t1_cf2nt4g,t1_cf2mm0m,null,1432174030,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Fuck that noise.  I will (and have) stuck up for due process and the rule of law even in the immediate aftermath of a tragedy or attack.  The problem is that in that aftermath most people are not thinking rationally at all - they're reacting emotionally, roaring and hooting and demanding revenge like a bunch of enraged monkeys, and as such they aren't prepared to listen to rational argument or coolly consider decisions until their emotional reaction passes and their jerking knee settles down again.

As such, I don't blame others *at all* for wisely keeping their own council until people are prepared to engage with them like rational adults instead of hurling abuse and insults at them like tantrum-ing toddlers or angry drunks.

&gt; It's super easy to say ""You can't do this it's mean!"" when you're not the person who's job it is to ensure these radicalised, trained and connected jihadists don't flood back into the UK/EU with impunity

Bullshit false dichotomy.  Arrest them, **convict them** and deport or imprison them, no argument.  But stripping them of citizenship and making them stateless *without any due process at all* is a direct violation of the fundamental principles of a civilised democracy.

We've had terrorists and terrorism for *hundreds of years*, and we've never needed to abuse due process to deal with them - why now?  We prosecuted terrorism as what it is - a crime, or conspiracy to commit a crime.  Why now do we suddenly need to start violating due process and treating it as some bizarre ""other"" category of offence that requires we abandon due process, basic legal rights and the foundational values of our entire democracy?

What you're doing is not advocating a reasonable, proportionate response to a social problem that's according to our values and acting for the long-term benefit of society.

You're painting a lurid, emotive and *completely unsupported* picture of a tragedy occurring, then pretending that the *only* alternative is to discard any semblance of due process and the rule of law and allow unchecked power to individual ministers or civil servants.

We haven't had a serious terrorist attack in the UK since 7/7 in 2005, and most of the attempted ones have been either single murders like Lee Rigby or so *comically* inept that the only person (if any) the terrorist managed to hurt was themselves.  *Empirically* we don't need these kinds of stupid, due-process-violating rules because we're doing just fine without them.

Moreover, how much *more* fine we'd have done if we hadn't spend the last ten years invading two other countries on the Americans' say-so (and in one case on completely trumped-up charges) is left as an exercise to the reader.

In addition, a large proportion of the terrorists have been native-born British converts to Islam (""none so pious as the converted"", as they say), and the worst incident we've had in years - 7/7 - all four of the bombers were completely unknown to law enforcement or intelligence services before the event... so this kind of pre-emptive, conviction-less legal punishment *wouldn't even have helped* in either the most common or the most serious incidents to date.

There is just *no demonstrated need* for the kind of due-process-violating ""laws"" successive governments have tried to pass to address these sorts of issues in the last few years, and as such all they can do is try to baselessly scare people with completely theoretical but emotively lurid inventions like yours.

&gt; whilst simultaneously abdicating responsibility when the inevitable happens

Abdicating responsibility *nothing*.  I will *absolutely* weather even the occasional *actual, significant, successful* terrorist attack if it's the price of living in a free, democratic country.

What I won't do is progressively advocate turning us into East Germany or the USSR to appease the whimpering pussies in the country who deludedly believe you can *ever* realistically sacrifice enough liberty and enough rights to make terrorist attacks impossible, or that living in a police state with periodic terrorist attacks is preferable to living in a free and open democracy with occasional terrorist attacks.

It's nonsense - even the former USSR had terrorist attacks, and they didn't have one tenth of the freedom we (still, just about) enjoy.  You're sacrificing real, tangible protections ensuring liberty and choice and that our society functions equitably and fairly in order to pursue a *mirage* of a ""perfectly safe society"" that can never, ever be achieved in practice.",0,1391089441,null,0,1391090131,0,cf2o3s2,t3_1wjab8,t1_cf2o3s2,t1_cf2ml6v,null,1432174180,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Side note, I think it has not as much to do with thinking Capoue is an incredible player, but the fact that we were playing a team that has already scored 100+ goals this season, and is an easy title favorite, and we decided to play a 19 year old that doesn't really offer anything defensively to help protect the back four.  I think it was extremely naive to do this, and also think it was naive to play Siggurdson and think that Chadli would have been a better option because he can add a little bit more defensively that Gylfi.

The maturity level of the US freshman students seemed to me to be lower than here in the UK. I viewed it as a symptom of their culture/schooling system. While in the UK by 16 you've already made decisions about staying for A-Levels and pursuing academics, exploring a trade at a technical college or just getting out and working, in the US you don't really make big life decisions until just prior to college. The woman I worked in the lab with almost shit herself when I told her I had been exclusively studying science based subjects since 16. This results in freshman, being away from their family and friends, trying to latch onto anything to help them through their situation. The frats and sororities are kind of a comfort blanket for some, a way to ease their way into independence, but unfortunately putting a gaggle of freshman desperate to make an impression on the higher-ups (who themselves are just just out of frat/sorority bootcamp) can result in some not so mature happenings.

Though I must state, as part of being a registered frat/sorority they are required by the university to carry out fundraising work and charity events, you've got a support network of students to help with class work, and there are other good aspects of the whole 'Greek Life'...

I haven't.  Moreover, neither have I made any claim that would need me to have.

I made claims based on *actual, empirical incidents* that have occurred.  *You're* the one making claims based on purely hypothetical scenarios with no offered evidence to support them.

If the existing intelligence services and law enforcement have successfully prevented serious attacks up to now, that should clearly indicate to you that **the present system is working fine**, and hence that granting more, even more-easily-abused powers to the government or law-enforcement/intelligence services is unnecessary.

It's literally stunning how you can not only base your position on entirely fabricated, hypothetical grounds... but that you can take *empirical evidence indicating that changes are unnecessary* and try to twist it into an argument that you need to grant more easily-abused powers and less oversight to government ministers and agencies.

&gt; Did you know that there was a very recent foiled terrorism attack in my own country? Probably not, I didn't see it covered in UK media much.

I'm not talking about your country.  I have no idea where you're from, and no idea what the security situation is like, what your historical culture or traditional national values involve, or what the best liberty/security tradeoff is for you.

I'm talking about the UK, because I live here, it's my country and I'm qualified to hold an opinion on it.  I notice that you apparently either don't hold yourself to the same restrictions.

Moreover/alternatively, you appear to be assuming that the statements I'm making in /r/unitedkingdom, about the UK, as a UK native, necessarily apply to your own country (wherever that is).  Why on earth would you assume that?  It's *prima facie* ludicrous.

Also, when someone accuses you of resorting to lurid fantasies and emotive bullshit in order to cover up a lack of empirical evidence for your arguments, resorting to *vastly more* emotive phrasing and examples and making it abundantly clear that you consider you or your family to be *personally* under attack *right now* does not disprove this argument.

In fact it only *proves* that yes, you *are* emotionally knee-jerk-reacting and flailing around for an answer and no, you *aren't* considering the issue dispassionately and with a cool head and calmly deciding what's for the best.

Don't get me wrong - it's absolutely *understandable* that you're upset and want to take some action given what you said, just like it's *understandable* that someone's drunk when they've imbibed a lot of alcohol.  What it *isn't*, however, is an argument that they're acting sensibly, proportionately and are in full control of their faculties in either case.

&gt; as if removing citizenship from known jihadists makes you or I somehow less free.

Point 1: you don't legally *know* they're jihadists until you convict them in court.  If you do that, we have no argument.  If you don't, what you have are *suspects*, and you're violating due process by punishing them.  Frankly the fact that you don't understand that a conviction is the **legally-mandated test** to differentiate between ""believe"" and ""know"" is rather concerning, as it's pretty much one of the most basic, fundamental bits of jurisprudence or legal theory in UK - hell: *any* civilised society's - law.

Point 2: Allowing government ministers to unilaterally revoke *anyone's* citizenship and the legal protection it brings necessarily weakens the precedent against later doing it to others.  Violating due process *necessarily* weakens the rule of law, and makes corruption, inconsistent or prejudicial application of the law more likely in the future.  Removing legal rights from anyone *necessarily* sets legal and public-opinion precedents, and *necessarily* lowers the bar to doing it more in the future.

If everyone enjoys legal rights, anyone arguing to remove them from you has a high barrier to get over.  If you already have a legal precedent of removing those same rights from people for one, two or a whole bunch of different reasons then people are mentally already half-way to agreeing with it, and it's much, much easier to then expand those categories to include whoever you want.

true,neonmantis,null,Derby International,"&gt; But we also have a dedicated cheque and card fraud unit paid for by visa and MasterCard. They investigate large scale fraud on consumers. Is this a bad thing?

Like most things, it is the details that matter. If that money effectively brought in new staff then great. If it didn't, as I suspect, then you are depriving other areas of resources. It depends where the resources are from and how serious you consider credit card fraud to be. If they have thrown some money at the police who have diverted resources and then used the money elsewhere then yes, it is a problem. I don't know the details though. 

I don't know how much they get back asset forfeiture either. 

You say they will do their best, but in my experience it totally depends on who you are, the type of crime committed and the likelihood of finding the perpetrator. If you're low on the list then they will most likely do nothing. I'm not blaming the police, rather I'm suggesting they are underresourced. 

Another conflict which concerns me is that as the links and mutual benefits between the companies and the police grow, will they be less likely to investigate if they are accused? I would suggest that would be a factor. We already live in a world where HSBC can launder drug money and fund terrorism with effective impunity by paying meager fines. Or the entire banking class can fraudulently sell PPI worth billions and again just get a slap on the wrist.

One solution is to break England into regions (e.g. South West) and these regions have their own Parliament.

So the ""way to do it but we need to make sure any law is not open to abuse too"" is to do it in much the same way that Switzerland do it (which also protects the medical staff) - a huge amount of paperwork and assessments of the patient, then the hospital provide a safe space for the family to be with the patient, and provide the lethal dose, which the patient then takes themselves (it's provided like a shot of liquid). It's observed the whole way and if anyone interferes by ""helping"" with the signing of papers or with the taking of the dose, they are guilty of murder or manslaughter or whatever the appropriate ruling would be. The medical professionals are only responsible for providing the dose and assessing the patient, they put the cup down and it's entirely up to the patient to pick it up and drink it, so they aren't ""responsible"" for the death.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"The story is from 2007, but the judgment of the appeal court (in which they strongly criticised the police) was handed down last week.

There are all sorts of problems with this case; VM carried out a private investigation into someone they thought were breaking the law. Having found them, the correct response should have bee to report it to the police, or sue them. But they didn't.

Instead they went to the police (who had no interest in prosecuting), and offered them money for them to apply to the court for a search and arrest warrant (something VM couldn't get themselves) - and in the appeal the police got strongly criticised for not telling the court that they had no interest in investigating or prosecuting the case.

Having got the police to do their dirty work (arrest and search), VM brought a private prosecution for ""conspiracy to defraud"", which is one of the most controversial offences in English law, being excessively vague, broad and easy to abuse (criminalising agreements to do some things which are themselves legal). Having secured convictions VM applied for, and failed to get a compensation order (so they didn't end up having to pay the police), but did get a confiscation order (described by the court as ""draconian""; essentially seizing all the defendant's assets).

So rather than suing the people, which would have involved the standard civil due process (with protections against unreasonable searches etc.), with them having to prove specific unlawful activity and, more importantly, actual damage, leading to an award of damages, they offered to pay the police to bring the full force of the state down on the defendants, used a controversial law, got this person sent to prison for 8 years (if they'd used the specific law, the maximum would have been 2 years, if proven). And then had all the guys assets seized.

I *do* get the need for gun control legislation, and I believe that the laws we have in place in terms of acquiring and storing firearms are the reason that we have such low gun crime in the UK, and *not* the laws pertaining to the length of the firearms we can use.

Either of them would be a better option, Capoue is far better defensively and Holtby is a much better passer with much better tactical awareness. Bentaleb made too many stupid passes in that game and got intercepted an awful lot.

As for goal diff, our second team defense was torn apart by the best strike force in the league.  The same strike force that ripped us apart earlier in the year, the same that dismantled Arsenal, Norwich, Newcastle, and even put 3 past Bayern Munich.  Anyone who thought that City was not going to score against us was delusional.  My hope was to outscore them back as their defense is shaky away from the Etihad.

true,Lou3000,flair1,,"1.  I agree, but I'm giving Tim some benefit of the doubt, and I think he is choosing Bentaleb because he wants to be more positive in possession.  Capoue is still very, very defensive minded.  With Bentaleb you get about 75% of Capoue's defensive skills, but a lot more attack.  That said, I think Bentaleb is the future, but you have to look at what you need now in games against teams like City.  I think Capoue would have been the right call.

2.  Rose was playing really well and showing what his supporters (me) like about him.  Kyle Walker lite.  Not great in defense, but can be really good going forward.  Again, Tim's team is about positive possession.  BAE is not the answer, this sub needs to drop this rose colored memory they have of him.

3.  Goal Difference is gone.  I personally think Everton is going to struggle for the next month with injuries (Lukaku, Oviedo, Distin), but Liverpool is the real competition and they have +29 in the GD category.  We aren't catching that.

4.  JD is not a scorer.  He hasn't been a scorer since 2009.  Kompany would have pushed JD off the ball every time he got a touch.  With 10 men, their defenders outnumbered our attack every time.

Lucas being out-of-action turns into a blessing in disguise as Coutinho, Henderson, and Gerrard become the most dominating midfield in the premier league over the final stretch.

We go on a dominating unbeaten run, where we win all our remaining home games and have one away draw which comes about due to a controversial decision that long sticks like a fly in the ointment.

Notable victories include a 4-1 embarrassment of ManU at Old Trafford, 9-0 defeat of Norwich where both Sturridge and Suarez get hat tricks, and a rousing 3-2 come-from-behind victory over City with crucial goals coming at the Kop end.

Season comes down to the final game of the year.  We've made up about half of our goal differential gap with City, but unfortunately end the season tied with City on points, losing out on the title by the slimmest of margins.

Gerrard is devastated to come so close without grabbing the title but is happy to return us to the Champions League.

Back then the country was in a bit of a shambles, we still hadn't fully recovered from the economic impact of WWII, and the seventies had been a pretty disastrous decade for us economically too. A generation earlier we owned the fucking world, but suddenly it seemed like we were nothing. In terms of Britain's place on the world stage, we were in danger of becoming an irrelevant faded colonial power with no real economic, military or diplomatic strength.

The embassy hijacking was a major a news event, the whole world was watching. So when the (previously obscure) SAS kicked their way in, shot the bad guys all up in their stupid foreign faces and got the hostages out in one piece, it was a massive confidence boost for the country - our way of shouting to the world ""We're still here you fuckers, and we've still got it.""

A few years later our fleet went halfway around the world and humiliated the Argentine forces on their doorstep, for no real reason other than to reinforce that point: **our empire may be gone but we are not finished yet, fuck with us at your peril**.

In both events innocent men died, and that's not to be taken lightly. But they also served to inject a new confidence into the British national psyche, to make the country believe that it could still be a major power in the world.

&gt; It's not ""fabricated"" or ""hypothetical"" either, it happened, I'm sure you could find the event on Google in 5 seconds

Did the attack that you related to your family *actually happen*?  No?  Then it was an example of a hypothetical attack, wasn't it?

As I've already explained once already, if you can cite *specific examples* of *actual attacks that succeeded* then you have hard evidence for your arguments.

Otherwise you're offering purely hypothetical examples of successful attacks... because the existing security services dealt with the possibility successfully and competently *without* any extra special powers, which is *in no way* evidence that they need further additional powers to deal with these kinds of incidents.  If anything, it demonstrates the exact opposite.

&gt; and dodging the meat of the post

What meat?  Seriously - what?  The point is that you haven't actually cited a single *actual successful attack that happened* as evidence that existing powers aren't enough.  Everything you've offered is a hypothetical attack that *could* happen (unpersuasive because it's fictional) or an example of a hypothetical attack that was planned by foiled by security services *without* requiring the extra powers that we're now debating.

In return, you've ignored nearly all the points in my post:

* You are, very obviously, emotionally reacting on the subject rather than coolly considering the issue.
* You have yet to provide a single example of an *actual successful* attack on UK soil that would have been prevented by these powers.
* Every example and argument you've provided is entirely hypothetical, either because you made them up or because the security services successfully foiled them *without* any additional powers.
* If security services foiled all those attacks without needing extra powers, it proof that they didn't need any extra powers to prevent them, and it's completely irrational to claim those attacks as evidence that they needed additional powers.
* You keep talking about punishing people that we ""know"" are jihadis or terrorists who are planning to attack the UK, but carefully ignore (or are simply ignorant of) the fact that a conviction in a court of law is *the legal standard* for differentiating between ""suspect"" and ""know"" in issues like this, so if they haven't been convicted then no, we don't ""know"" by definition.
* Weakening legal universal protections for any class of citizen necessarily sets dangerous precedents for circumventing the law in certain cases, and it's far, far easier to then expand the scope of those exemptions than it is to introduce them in the first place.
* Moreover, government has a *proven track record* of massively and systematically abusing any new anti-terrorism powers and due process exemptions that have already been granted to them, even for incredibly petty offences like ""putting bins out early"" or ""policing school catchment areas"".

Tinned fruit, tinned meat, tinned milk, tinned beans, 

Tinned minds, tinned breath.

A house for ninety-seven down

And once a week a half a crown 

For twenty years.

Who washes his repulsive skin 

In women's tears:

And smash his desk of polished oak

And smash his hands so used to stroke

And stop his boring dirty joke

And make him yell.

The profits of the stinking cad;

They've tasted Hell.

It's not their fault they do not know 

The birdsong from the radio, 

It's not their fault they often go 

To Maidenhead

And talk of sport and makes of cars

In various bogus-Tudor bars 

And daren't look up and see the stars

But belch instead.

In labour-saving homes, with care

Their wives frizz out peroxide hair

And dry it in synthetic air

And paint their nails.

true,shakawhenthewallsfel,lfc12,,"&gt;I think based on the last 4 years 70 is a fair watermark but I must admit I have no idea what the projected points required this year are so I stand to be corrected on this.

In [another thread on here from like 8 hours ago that's basically the same as yours](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/1wjndi/8_wins_to_reach_70_points_where_do_the_wins_come/), someone pointed out that the 4th and 5th place teams right now are both something like 5-6 points ahead of where they were last year at this time. So although 70 points will do it *most* years, it seems pretty unlikely that'll be the case this year. To be really sure, I think we're going to want 76+.

We've got 46 now, which means we need another 30 points. 10 wins, 9 wins 3 draws, etc. etc. Now, let's look at the fixture schedule:

West Brom (A) - Should be a win, but you never know. They just scored three on Aston Villa (more than we managed to at home), and they did nearly beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.

Arsenal (H) - Could go any way, really. If we play our best we can win this, but we don't always do that

Fulham (A) - Should be a win

Swansea (H) - Definitely winnable. They're not pushovers, but let's call it a win.

Southampton (A) - They beat a much healthier Liverpool side at Anfield, not too hard to see us losing or drawing here. 

Sunderland (A) - Should be a win

United (A) - Could be anything, really. 

Cardiff (A) - Should be a win

Spurs (H) - Definitely winnable if we play well.

West Ham (A) - Given their result against Chelsea, tough to say. We've got more scoring threats, but against ten men in the box? Who knows. Plus they've got Carroll who may be in revenge mode.

City (H) - Winnable but tough. Draw or loss very possible.

Norwich (A) - God help us if we don't win this one.

Chelsea (H) - Could go either way

Palace (A) - Should be a win

Newcastle (H) - Without Cabaye and at Anfield on the last day of the season, you have to hope we'll win this one, but Newcastle can never be counted out.

So, of the fixtures left I'd say that barring any Hull City repeats, there are 7 we definitely *should* win (I'm counting West Brom even though I fear we may fuck that up). That leaves us 9 points short of the target, though, with these games to get them from:

Arsenal (H)

Southampton (A)

United (A) 

Spurs (H)

West Ham (A)

City (H) 

Chelsea (H)

Newcastle (H)

Three wins or two wins and three draws from there is definitely doable -- I'd hope we'll beat at least Spurs, West Ham, and Newcastle -- but it isn't a sure thing. There isn't much margin for error. If we don't beat Spurs, West Ham, or Newcastle, that means we need to get points from Chelsea, City, United, Southampton, or Arsenal. That could be a tough ask given that City, Arsenal, and Chelsea are the best teams in the league, and United and Southampton are both away games. 

And of course, that's assuming we beat all the teams we definitely should beat, which we probably won't. The Hull City result, the Villa result, etc. show that there are definitely some cracks in our squad, and I'm sure we'll have at least one or two more games like that where we underperform. Maybe we can pull out wins in them anyway. But many of those games are also away, which will make them tougher than the home fixtures were.

tl;dr I think we're still going to need a very impressive second half of the season to finish top 4.

MLB and NFL are boring as watching paint dry, the endless replays of every play, challenges, etc. slow the game down tremendously.  Rich tradition?  The only tradition is making more airtime for more advertising.  No thanks.

What should happen, is that a panel reviews the call with the officials after the game, and cards should be rescinded if they are given erroneously.  The officials should be fined or sanctioned for abysmally bad calls, or in this case, a *linesman* making a bad call that a *referee* should be responsible for.

true,Tru99,logo,,"I think Navas or Silva.  They create so many chances and keep the defense working hard for 90 minutes never letting up.  

My thoughts on Jan?
Kompany - You're right on the Watford game, different match after his pep talk and entrance into the game.
Kolorov - Playing at such a high level right now, always involved.  I'd be fine with him as PotM.
Negredo and Aguero - our great front, but it's hard to give them Player of the Month because of the time off for injury, may they heal quickly.
Milner - still my favorite sub, hope he gets some more playing time.  I always feel better when he's in brought in.
Yaya and Dinho - Need Yaya's back to heal, but even injured he still plays so well.  Dinho is invaluable.
Hart - playing better but still missing a step somewhere.  Still, the lay out for the disallowed goal yesterday made me happy to see him giving every last inch.  Pride. in. Battle.

I think I'm only really disappointed in Dzeko. That may just be a case that everyone else is playing so well, creating chances, pushing the pace, that he sometimes looks a bit slow and it's hard not to compare him to Negredo or Aguero when they play side by side.

Since the late 1960s the NFL stadium clock has been official, but by then television was an important factor in the NFL, **so the two-minute warning was retained as a commercial break** and to serve as ""tension building"" time, and thus has become an important part of the game's flow.

Sturridge is scoring at a better pace this season than Torres ever did, than Owen ever did, at a better pace than even Aguero is now (same # of goals, Dan's played something like 20 fewer minutes), etc. However, this fact is so incongruous with the perception of him, which is far lower than Aguero's now or Torres's/Owen's in their pomp. Hell, on r/soccer just yesterday most people were saying Sturridge couldn't get into the Italian national side or maybe could, but only as a clear third/fourth choice behind Balotelli and El Sharaawy who are head and shoulders above him. Even in this thread, a lot of people are trotting out the ""it's too soon"" argument even though Fernando assumed god-like status with his first goal, but 27 goals in 34 apps for Dan is still ""too soon"" to make a comparison.

The difference is context. 

- Torres came along at a time when we hadn't had a proper striker since Owen. All respect to Crouch, Baros, Cisse, Morientes, Bellamy, Dirk, etc. but we were absolutely creaming our pants at the thought of having a star striker again. Sturridge came into a team that already had Luis who had stepped into Fernando's shoes the day he walked out the door. Frankly, we were pretty divided on whether we even wanted Sturridge. Starved vs. spoiled.
- Fernando did it on the biggest stage in the CL, Sturridge hasn't had that chance. He also had a sexy Spanish name and played in a sexy Spanish national side while Sturridge is just Danny from Birmingham, a Chelsea and City reject.
- Rightly or wrongly, Suarez's presence affects our perception massively. Yeah, he provides Dan with a lot of silver-platter goals, but I think we might be forgetting how incredibly incisive Gerrard was when Torres was at his best here and how Sturridge bailed us out repeatedly at the start of this season.

As such, it seems that SC revised their offer in line with this.  Meanwhile GFH have been courting Cellino to try and get more money.

SC have been funding the club since November, but seem to have had to the goalposts moved on them and David hasn't received the level of financial backing he hoped for.

So, he remains MD so can't completely slag off the owners, but has been made to look like a total prat in front of everyone.

Not that I'm defending his actions, I just understand the mental position he's found himself in.  If we get Cellino, I have no idea what the fuck happens next.

Brian will get sacked and his own man put in place. It'd be a total fucking mess.  More so than it is now.

The first case you refer to is Ian Tomlinson, who was near a demonstration when he was caught on multiple cameras being battered by a police officer with a truncheon, before dying a few hours later. The jury at the inquest found a case of unlawful killing.

The Crown Prosecution service fucked up mightily (I'm being charitable; the more likely explanation is they did this deliberately) by only charging the police officer concerned with the maximum reasonable offence, that of manslaughter, despite the fact that he was filmed  from multiple cameras committing a blatant aggravated assault on a completely passive citizen. Since the particular form of manslaughter we're talking about here is essentially 'an unlawful act of violence which results in someone's death', one would think that if there was doubt as to whether the act of violence killed the victim, then he could also be charged with an alternative offence of assault, battery, or aggravated assault (the same way a murder charge can carry an alternative charge of manslaughter); but the CPS failed to do their job.

The officer was acquitted on the basis that there was doubt as to whether it was his assault that actually killed Tomlinson - there were three autopsies, and one of the three doctors (who was subsequently struck off for misconduct, related to other work on autopsies) didn't think the assault caused the death. The police officer was dismissed from the force immediately after he was found not guilty. The cops obviously knew he was guilty, but they managed to wangle enough reasonable doubt (between the dodgy autopsy doctor and the prosecutor's missteps) to get him off the hook of criminal offences when on duty. The whole thing stinks of an ass-covering job by people in the law and police force.

Your second example is that of Jean Charles de Menezes. He was not an illegal immigrant, and he did not start to run away from armed police. He calmly walked onto a tube train, sat down, was accosted by an officer who attemped to restrain him; this arresting officer was pushed out of the way by the murdering officer who then proceeded to fire a large number of bullets into him.

There are other, less well known, instances of people being brutalised in custody by the Metropolitan police (there was a documentary called 'Injustice' a few years back which catalogued a few), but you've failed to even get to grips with the facts of the two examples you claim to know something about.",0,1391108734,null,0,1391110459,0,cf2wgg8,t3_1wjx13,t1_cf2wgg8,t1_cf2sn3w,null,1432178276,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

The first time i had a broken tail light which had been busted by drunk people outside a club. The police saw this happening but did nothing and gave me a ticket. Which after, getting cctv footage, was cancelled.

Second time was a 'routine' check.

Third a policeman followed me for 5 miles from the motorway exit all the way to my house. As i get out of my car he asks me why i had driven slowly around the round about which is literally 50 meters away from my house. Bitch. 

4th Was just after winter of 2010. Snow had just cleared and there were some really deep potholes that would damage a low car. So i went slightly to the right and left to dodge the holes. Bear in mind i was within the lane. The police officer behind me did the same fucking thing! Bitch pulled me over and breathalyzed me!!!

5th time i got stopped and they searched for narcotics!!!! Fuck me. I dont even know what weed smells like!

6th apparently a person like me is suspect when they drive certain cars. So i cant do well for myself just because of the way i look!!!!

7th another routine.

8th Stopped me for insurance. Asks me to get into his car which i do. He calls dispatch to clarify i was the owner of the car. Couldnt believe id have a car like that. 

9th stopped for no reason. Tells me i have been stopped 8 times before. Turns out they werent fuckin routines.

If they are angry its because it hits close to home.

If gay people are taking their lives because they feel they've no place and nowhere to turn to, then we must look at what parties and individuals are contributing to creating a society where those young people think that. 

Whenever we've the likes of Iris 'Ack shure I know a guy who can zap it out of them' Robinson, Poots and his 'Gay people have AIDS-blood!' and anti-adoption crusade, Maurice 'God tossed Hurricane Katrina to kill gays' Mills, Ian ""Gay people give me the cooties"" Paisley Jr... All the way back to Ian ""Save ulster from sodomy"" Paisley Sr all kicking around, it's fair to say they are an Ant-homosexual party. While they are perfectly entitled to those views, the DUP have clearly, through public statements and legislation, been at the forefront of forcing those views upon others and creating a society intolerant of homosexuals.  

And whenever the people in power are so publicly anti-gay, it gives a green light to those who would carry out attacks on the homes of homosexuals on the street level. ""But those boys who run the country agree with me, I'll get away with it"" they say.

Not to say that other parties aren't part of it also. The catholic church and it's bizarre ""We love gay people but God doesn't want you loving the same sex"" stance really doesn't help in dispelling this culture either.

So what happens when people feel that the government hate them, the churches hate them, there are people on the street who'd be willing to knife them given half the chance? Nowhere to go but off the side of the bridge.

Again, big difference in holding those views for religious reasons and imposing those on the rest of society. David Ford (Alliance) I understand belongs to a church that doesn't think much of Homosexuality, and may have similar views himself, but you don't see him or his party try to deny the rights of others to live the lives they want. (In fact, I seem to remember his church forced him out for this very reason). If the DUP were to hold those views, but still push towards creating a society where everyone could live however they want with no interference? No issue. It's been anything but though.

Connected journalists get information that the club is happy to release - the journo gets a story and the club gets publicity.

&gt; The fact your sticking up for convicted murders to stay in this country (Id see your point if they were to be tortured/executed)

Well, that is part of the point, yes. Look at the Abu Qatada case. He couldn't be deported because it was ruled he was at risk of facing unfair evidence gained from torture in Jordan. There was another case about a convicted rapist who would have been likely to have been tortured in the country he moved from when he was 10 years old if he was deported back. When people are blocked from being deported, there is pretty much always a bloody good reason for it, which the government and supporters of this type of legislation try at best ignore, and at worst revel in.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt;If the uni took 3m and gave it to the staff, this would be a 0.5% increase. It would be the difference between £7 per hour and £7.04 per hour for those below the living wage.

Firstly, as I mentioned in your earlier post, you need to learn how to use statistics, you have again lied. According to the a Freedom of Information request and [this report](http://www.varsity.co.uk/news/6703) it shows that *""1,113 college and university staff are receiving wages of less than £7.65 per hour.""* As such if you do the calculations of 3m it neither amounts to a *""0.5% increase""* as you falsely claim nor would it be equivalent to a 4p increase in hourly wages. [you've either lied or ignorantly divided 3m by the total employees of Cambridge University instead of those earning below the living wage, which is the whole point of this debate.]

In fact, counter to your claim, £3 million would be enough to give each staff earning below the living wage a £2695 a year pay increase [3m/1113 (which is more money that it would cost to move all on the minimum wage to the living wage, and since not all workers are actually earning the minimum wage, it would cover the costs even more). The wine budget would be enough to give all Cambridge University Staff the Living Wage with money to spare.

The funny thing is even if the amount wasn’t enough, which it is, it would still be wrong. The point is it's symbolic, it symbolises an institution that isn't short on money, that can and does spend £3 million on wine. [A University who’s vice-chancellor does get a pay rise of £20,000](http://www.varsity.co.uk/news/6650) whilst thousands of workers don’t earn enough to live and most employees have seen a 13% pay cut over 4 years. It is dishonest to say these debates aren't connected. Even if 3 million wasn’t enough, it should still be opposed just like people oppose MPs expenses, and their income increases, despite the fact that in the large scale of British economic spending it's a pittance, why then? Because lots of people are many times worse off, and any bits of excessive spending, however little it appear in relation to the whole, even if it couldn't totally ameliorate peoples condition, it could help. The argument that because you don’t have enough money to help everyone therefore you shouldn’t save anyone, has always been disgustingly false.

From what I remember, the 55k figure is just for phase 1 - the redevelopment of the Main Stand. This will be mostly/exclusively be corporate tickets and will include some sort of external concourse. Phase 2 will be the Anny Road end which will take the capacity up to ~58k and apparently will include some flats, though that sounds a bit odd to me. As Bascombe says, an application for planning permission could go in in April and if we've done a lot of work up front, could be granted in 3-4 months.

Finally - and take this with a big pinch of salt - there's a lad who claims to have spoken to Ian Ayre on a night out who said it could rise to 64k. This sounds plausible to me - especially the bit about Ayre being pissed and giving out club secrets - but I'd expect it to hinge on demand for tickets holding up in a 58k stadium and how onerous LCC's requirements are for improving the transport infrastructure.

Please, illustrate how this is the only interpretation and no other. And how you managed to arrive at 'object'.

&gt;every piece of art is a reflection of the artist's social conditions and their internal prejudices, even pop songs.

And you can prove this how? How do you know it's not a parody? In fact, how do you presume to know *anything* about the intention? And again, you're insisting (in fact, *dictating*) that there can be only one such interpretation.

If you're going to interpret every single song, movie and book literally as a reflection of the creator, you're actually presuming to have more knowledge of them than they do, which has to be the most arrogant presumption I've ever heard of.

So, good luck with that.

true,InternetKillTV,null,null,"I just wanted to chime in here. The reason you felt like that is because the first season is exactly that. A series of ordinary stereotypical characters you wouldn't look at twice when crossing the street. But that's where the show thrives, it shows how no matter what you think of a person there is so much in them that can be awakened that you couldn't think was there. The connections you feel with the characters in Breaking Bad and their development is far beyond anything I've ever seen created before. But Breaking Bad is a different viewing experience, and that change spans over 60 episodes rather than 5. 

The story is basic in the first 5 episodes, the first series is rather tame after they had to cut it short due to the writers strike. Doctor Who is a show with a series of fantastic often single episode narratives but Breaking Bad requires a different approach because of its more prominent overarching plots. It's not a show you can realistically judge on the first 5 episodes and it's certainly one of the most unpredictable shows I've ever watched once you get to the end. 

It starts tame and as the characters develop realistically as a result of tragic events they evolve and change into something you A, never thought could be there, and B, you could have never predicted. As is said in the first episode; ""Chemistry is the study of change, growth, then decay, and then transformation"". 

Anyway I just wanted to chime in with that as an avid fan of both shows and perhaps inspire you to approach it again in the future with a different view. Or not, you're completely entitled to your view on the subject :')

You've obviously failed to understand/read what I actually wrote. I'm an arts student. My point was universities are pretty much the only employers who offer people the change from the arts to continue doing the arts. On the market, outside the publically funded university, arts jobs are near non-existent. If I wanted to continue doing research and study into history or anthropology the only way I could reasonably do it is through the University. As such those who do actually have very little other opportunities to use their expertise elsewhere, and in the case of lecturers that do (really only the sciences), they usually take those opportunities. University isn't about altruism at all, and it's stupid to think so. People studying archaeology don't do so for altruistic reason, because they want to help others or further humanity, they do so because they enjoy it.

true,ActionPriest,null,null,"The SFE application process may have changed since I did it a few years ago, so the nature of the forms may be different, and this may be outdated, however:

If your parents are happy to submit the incorrect documents, and declare that as their income then it is entirely on them.

They are the ones making the declaration, and have to sign that part of the form. The worst thing that will happen to you is that you will have to repay the grant/loan. Your parents, however could be prosecuted for fraud. Won't necessarily be, but it is very easy to use the information on a p60 to confirm the truth.

Personally given your parents are being childish about this: I would submit the documents, fill in the forms, have them sign them, and send it in. 

Then let know that since sending in the forms you have done some further research and that you are really sorry, but have found out that SFE verify this information with HMRC, and unless you very quickly get in touch with the correct information, there is a chance they will get investigated for fraud.

Then leave it up to them if they want to take the risk. 

Your mileage may vary based on this plan, but I have very little time for parents who muck about with their kids on tis issue. These laws were written on the basis that parents retained financial responsibility for their kids when at uni, to a level appropriate to their income, and that they would properly participate in the process. 

Why don't they want to get the p60s fixed?

Shortly after I passed my test. I was an idiot and it was a wake up call. I was incredibly apologetic and polite to the policeman, explained I was a novice driver in an unfamiliar area (it was an outskirt of a town, not a built-up area so I ignorantly thought it was a 40) and he had a very calm respectful chat with me, and gave me a slapped wrist. I learned my lesson. 

Second time, I wasn't wearing my seatbelt around town. It isn't something I make a habit of, for some reason I just didn't do it that day. I clocked that he saw me, and saw him turn round and instantly knew what was up. Slipped my seatbelt on. He came to my window and said ""I could have  sworn you didn't have your seatbelt on a moment ago"". I decided not to treat him like an idiot, fessed up, said that it had slipped my mind, and that I realised when he hit his lights, so slipped it on. Again, I was incredibly apologetic, very polite. Policeman seemed shocked that I admitted it, and was very nice. Let me off with a slapped wrist and a 7-day wonder to sort my tire tread out on my front driver-side wheel. 

Has taught me that if you treat the police decently, like human beings doing their job, and demonstrate some humility, they will treat you well and in a fair manner. I have nothing but respect for the police I have dealt with, and that would be no different even if I had been written up, it was totally my fault and a fair cop.

Since then, 15 years without a single incident.

Irrelevant. I can declare war on France, it doesn't mean we are at war. It takes responsible parties to declare war, and it has to have a legal foundation. You need to separate rhetoric from reality. We are at ""war"" on drugs, it doesn't mean we kill all potheads on sight.

An interesting fact is that ZipZap actually partnered with BitInstant (Charlies Shrems woefully inadequate BTC conversion service) back when it was still operating (src: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=127838.0). Now, while there is no suggestion ZipZap was aware-of BitInstant's activities or aiding or abetting money laundering, the service they provide does not require customers to identify themselves. Typically this hasn't been a concern since the endpoints in a ZipZap transaction are eWallets or services where customer KYC is indirectly undertaken (E.g. if you used ZipZap to fund a Neteller account, Neteller would have KYC'd your account). This is not the case with Bitcoin transactions. 

Given the fact that the American government have indirectly (through the arrest of Mr Shrem) highlighted the money laundering concerns they have with regard to Bitcoin, the fact that others in this space (Bitcoin ATM, Bitstamp, Mt.Gox etc) have taken steps to identify their customers to prevent money laundering and the fact ZipZap is an American company, it is not beyond the realms of fantasy that ZipZap may well have been advised of this apparent...shortcoming in their service. 

It will not have escaped the notice of authorities that a majority of those interested in taking advantage of ZipZap's service do so because they are looking for anonymity of a physical (fiat)-&gt;digital (Bitcoin) cash transaction (whatever their reasons). The current climate does not favour this. Remember; anything to do with money in the UK is heavily regulated. Just because Bitcoin isn't classified as money in law does not mean that ZipZap would be exempt from accusations of assisting in the circumvention of UK/European financial regulations however *misguided* they may be perceived to be... 

Of course, this is entirely a guess - so it might just be minor technical difficulties... time will tell.

People get prosecuted for ENORMOUSLY lower sums when it comes to false declarations of income for benefits. This is a fraud potentially worth more than £10,000 depending on the incomes in question.

The information on the p60 is easily checked by SFE with HMRC. It has all the information necessary on it to do so, and can be done in moments. HMRC may also have the wrong info, but if it does it may get updated at any point.

Really, they're actually really good and the US is introducing them when/where it can because you don't have to come to yet another bloody stop. This is because you look, as you're approaching the roundabout, for traffic heading your way. If no one is coming towards you then you don't stop - in fact, for the love of all things, do not stop - you just slow and merge. The UK uses ""Give way"" pretty much everywhere, whereas the US uses stop signs everywhere. Slow down, please slow down, but do not come to a sudden stop because the people behind you don't expect it. Rather you slow down and look as you approach and merge if there is a gap.

You don't make a right turn into a roundabout. They all go to the left, and so obviously you do too. You go all of the way around - and if you miss your exit, don't panic. It is a circle, it goes all the way around and you can try again. This is good when that local idiot cuts you off, you miss read the sign, or when the GPS (or ""satnav"" as it is called here) tells you the 3rd exit but doesn't specify that the second is really a farm track :p Don't worry about going around again. Nobody cares and you probably won't even see those same people again because they'll be merging and exiting before you get back around.

For the most part you won't be fighting for space. Yes, there are always morons, but mostly people let you in. Use your indicators to show that you want to move. People respect them here and don't consider it a chance to cut you off. This is especially true on the faster ""A"" roads or motorways. Lorry (Truck) drivers will generally move out of the lane if they see you merging. They'll then move back to the left-hand lane (the slower lane) because they stick to the speed limits.

So, when exiting put your turn signal on and, after looking, merge and exit. People don't want to crash into you or stop you doing either. One thing though, please look around. If you're in a small towns in particular they tend to put cross walks right at the edge of the roundabout. If they are zebra crossings - just stripes on the road and orange lights on poles, then pedestrians have the right of way and will expect you to stop. Just like merging you have to look around you as you are exiting and slow/stop if you need to.

They seem to play off rather well with one another and I can totally buy a young man falling for someone who's twice his age. That shit happens all the time in real life.

My problem is the inspiration of the character. River was based on the Time Traveller's Wife. Moffat loved the idea of making two characters who meet each other in the opposite order. That was fine for a one off encounter. The entire story could have been a mystery that none of us will get to see. 

The problem is that she was written into the story more and more. Answer me this: How can you express love when two characters meet in opposite order? How can you show when the Doctor knows more about her, she knows a little less? In order to do that, you are going to need to cheat a little bit. Make her obsessed with the Doctor is the only way to do it. That whole Silence thing is another, probably not the best way, but it the way we got.

Provided you can convince a court that you had an offer of a job and that you fulfilled all of the conditions of the offer then the potential employer would be in breach of the implied employment contract. 

You could sue the employer for any damages or loss caused. If you are serious about pursuing this then you should try and work out what this has cost you. This would be loss of earnings/benefits that you could have claimed/earned whilst waiting around for them, plus the notice period of earnings (i.e. if you had to give one months notice you could claim one months pay). Try to work out what you can claim and decide if it is worth pursuing. 

Next step is to contact a solicitor, ideally one with a specialism in employment law. If you're a member of a union, now is the time to give them a call. Otherwise find a solicitor that you like and see how they rate your chances. I wouldn't expect to find someone willing to take this sort of case on a no-win no-fee basis, but YMMV.

Most of what arts professors teach is not meaningless.  Secondly, any meaning it has is certainly not dependant upon a jobs market for that specialisation, or whether it can be monetised in any other way.  If you're an arts student,  I would have thought that would be pretty plain to you already.

I think some people might have forgot how vital he was for Chelsea last season. The games he was injured or rest for example Chelsea - QPR (0-1) were the games we ended up losing or drawing 90 percent of the time. He was that brilliant catalysator to our midfield who also managed to average nearly an assist or goal per game.

However I trust Mourinho and in the long run he made the best decision. I think Mata has reached his potential and there´s a lot more to come in Oscar and Hazard. Also he´s not te typical definsive minded player who would fit into Mourinho´s Chelsea system.

It's probably got around a 90% pro-independece comment slant, but there  are a lot of points regularly made. There are also a few regular pro-union commenters that lead to robust debate on occasion.

You might want to double check the facts backing up some of the cons in your list. Some are non-issues (trade, commonwealth, arguably defence, business relocation AFAIK). And a couple that will be straightforwardly solved in the wash (e.g., EU). 

Some in the pro-indepence camp aren't keen on the idea of a currency union. The idea has disadvantages, but whether or not it's a ""con"" depends on your viewpoint.

You might want a third category ""can be argued either way"".

true,no_soul_ginger,flair3,,"Absolutely, the slippery slope is a fallacy in itself.  My question is still unanswered - where do you draw the line over reviews?
Let's say a foul is committed and an official issues a yellow - the fans on TV and in stadiums that have the benefit of review can see that the offending player came in with studs up, clearly no intention of getting ball, and the fouled player was carried off with an injury.  Does a team have the right to insist on a review then?  How about when a goalkeeper makes a questionable challenge in a 1v1 situation and the attacker is brought down as a result - but the official does not issue a card?  How about an incident of a 2nd yellow, does that yellow card get reviewed?  In either of those cases (If pressed, I'm sure we could all come up with a scenario), who gets the benefit of review?  Or does it only apply when a red card is actually issued - doesn't seem in keeping with fairness then, does it?  Would officials be less likely to issue red cards if they know a review is likely?

How long should the review take?  How many angles should the incident be shown from?  What are the players supposed to do during a review?  Would the result of a stoppage for review affect the momentum of the game in much the same way that a player taking their sweet time after ""injury"" affects momentum?  Who asks for the review in the first place?

It's not so simple.  One of the best things about soccer is that it is full of action.  It doesn't really stop - even when putting the ball back into play from the touchline or a set piece, players are still jockeying for position.  Injuries, sure.  Head-head collisions, sure.  That's just civilized.  But even then, when dirty fucking Argentine strikers/Olympic divers go to ground, the play doesn't always stop.  Even stoppage time is an issue - look at the insane clock additions that Chel$ki got yesterday against West Ham...

It's awfully easy for people to pound their bar tops and cry for video review.  Believe me, it would have meant a world of difference in the US defeat to Ghana in the 2010 World Cup, and undoubtedly would have had effects on the entire tournament - but there are better ways to go about it, starting with using post-game tape and reviews to reverse match ban decisions and holding officials' feet to the fire over bad calls.  Guarantee that the level of officiating would improve dramatically, THUS making the occasional game-affecting bad call far less likely, WITHOUT changing how the game is played.

Once a stoppage for ""x"" comes into effect, tactics and play adjusts to use it to an advantage.  I'm not so sure I want soccer to go that route.  Shit happens, we're supposed to be upset about it, and in a just world, that linesman (and field official) should get a match ban each without pay.",0,1391118723,null,0,false,0,cf31nhy,t3_1wjy32,t1_cf31nhy,t1_cf2yrph,null,1432180804,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Speaking for a tiny minority of the nation, I find myself wondering why they haven't jumped on the bandwagon arguing that anything taking the piss out of Jesus is offensive. Then again, I think they might have. Certainly they put a stop to Jerry Springer: The Opera.

I've thought of (what I think is) an interesting extension to this issue. Muslims often (how often, I don't know but it's supposed to be always?) say ""Peace be upon him"" or type ""pbuh"" after saying or writing ""Mohammed"". What if there was a change of state and it was decided by 'the international Muslim commmunity' (that well known cohesive group) that anyone saying or writing ""Mohammed"" should say ""Peace be upon him"" or it is a great offence? I daresay it's possible that a selective reading of the text could imply that *anyone* saying his name should be reverent. 

If showing a graphical depiction - which has been done and is still often done I think in some Muslim countries/regions - of their prophet is so offensive that non-Muslims can't do it, then it can easily be extended I think to situations where people say his name and don't give it the proper respect.

Specifically, what parts of the game play are so traditional that have not been adapted/adjusted/altered/changed to accommodate commercials for a television audience?  What other sports actually stop the game and clock so viewers are subjected to a commercial break?

That red card was *part of the game*.  Rose made a challenge, which was a questionable decision on his part in the first place...hand on the arm *in the box* and tackling *from behind, in the box*.  He was not beside the striker, he was not in front of the striker, he was in a position behind him.  99.999% of strikers will go to ground in that exact instance, and nearly any official in nearly any league, seeing it happen in real time, would whistle it a foul - whether it was really a foul or not.  Simply because of where Rose was when he went in for the ball.  He got ball, yes - he also got player, and he also had his hand on the player.  We have the luxury of frame-by-frame to tell us that he got ball first - but play happens much faster than frame by frame.  The field referee got it right - the *linesman* flagged for a foul, and the *linesman* was the one who, by doing so, forced a call to be made.  Dzeko didn't dive, Rose didn't actually foul him, but as much as it pains people to realize it, it was *part of the game*.

Sorry, I thought school was for there to benefit youth, not for ""convenience?""

&gt;Additionally, the longer school day could mean more time for extra curricular stuff - more sports activities / chess/drama/math/IT clubs etc. Alternatively, time for completing homework in an environment which has the resources - some students might not have a computer/internet at home, or a desk, or even an environment which is conducive for getting homework completed.

And what about kids who can't play sports? Or kids that don't want to join a club? Or kids like my former self, who were so disillusioned with life because of the depressing thought that you couldn't be successful because school has drilled it in to you that the only way to be successful was to do well in school, go to college, get in to a good university and then spend the next 50 years working 9 till 5?

Preparing children for a single way of life is the stupidest thing a government could do. Enforcing that mind set on people who are not meant for that life does nothing to benefit them; the majority of the skills I now use in my working life I taught myself outside of school - keeping me in there longer would have been nothing but a detriment.

Because ""enhancing defence"" is not a cost-free action.  Every wall you put up to keep outsiders out also inevitably acts to lock you in.

As such it's wise to not put up any more walls than you need to, and to not put up additional walls without good evidence they're necessary.  After all, if you have no reason to believe they are necessary, *what's the point in putting them up?*

As you've amply demonstrated throughout this entire conversation, you *don't* have a single actual shred of evidence to support your position - all you have is your unreasoning emotional knee-jerk reactions and your fevered imagination.

&gt; If you can't see a problem with thousands of trained, veteran, connected and funded jihadists flooding back into the EU after the Syrian Civil War is over then there isn't much point continuing this conversation

Let's talk when it actually happens, and if we can't find *actual laws* they've broken to charge them with and imprison them.

Also I'd like to see a reliable, credible source on that ""thousands"" claim, or is it another baseless hypothetical?

Then recall I already said I was less concerned about revoking citizenship for dual citizens - it's specifically the British (and only British) citizens that we'd leave stateless that I was primarily concerned with, and seeing as they're a distinct minority there sure as hell aren't ""thousands"" of them.

Finally, recall that my criticism all along has been about the abuse of due process and vesting the unilateral ability to remove citizenship in one minister or individual.  Propose a tribunal or court-based system with evidence and defence counsel and I'm all ears - just don't make it a unilateral decision by an unaccountable government minister.

Jesus - did you read any of my comments *at all?* 0_o

&gt; I wish you'd put that up front then I could've avoided wasting my time with a conspiracy theorist.

I don't think you know what ""conspiracy theorist"" means, because no-one's positing any conspiracy theory here - just a common and well-known tendency for government powers and legal precedents to creep and enlarge their scope over time.  You understand the *concept* of a legal precedent, right?

Hell, I even gave you an *empirical example* of it, where local councils were granted sweeping new powers to fight terrorism, and ended up spying on regular families *in their homes* for the suspected heinous crimes of fly-tipping, sending their kids to school outside of their local catchment area and putting their bins out a day of two early... most of which also turned out to be false.

Brakes completely disappeared on me (2nd hand car that I only drove out the forecourt a couple of weeks earlier) and in a panic all I could do was ease the handbrake up while aiming for something to stop me quick. I decided against aiming for the crowd of people, or chancing it across a busy crossroad, and put it into the back of a police 4x4. ""Decided"" isn't really fitting, I didn't really have much time to think critically. The front end of my car practically fell off. Policeman was in the car, jumped out, and yet again I experienced a completely professional, classy officer of the law. 

It was obvious his first concern was my own health and safety, and asked me to sit still while he radioed an ambulance (nothing wrong with me at all apart from some seatbelt bruising, some fuzziness from the scare, and an extremely damaged ego) and set about coning off the area behind me to warn other cars. Once the paramedic checked me out the cop breathalysed me as a matter of process (he had to have one too just for being crashed into!) and then let me explain myself. Their traffic guys found no skidmarks which seemed to back up my lack of brakes, and they were happy I was telling the truth, and the matter went no further. One guy tried to examine my car but the front was a complete mess. Insurance took it from there. He let me borrow his mobile to call a recovery company and everything. Total gentleman and an asset to the force, and I wrote a letter thanking him and his colleagues for their  rapid professional conduct and care. Good guys who generally try to do their best in a difficult job, in my opinion. 

Thank you for the gold! you are a gent. I'll pay it forward when I'm able.

Right.

As someone who studies IFF's and capital flow through tax entities like Jersey, City of London, Ireland, Cayman Islands, Guernsey, Monaco, Switzerland and other such secrecy jurisdictions/tax havens as dubbed by organizations like the World Bank, Tax Justice Network, and Global Financial Integrity I would expect these company documents to stay in there respective jurisdictions with any real primary links between Roman/Chelsea FC PLC and any companies that own player economic rights to stay buried.

Whether the club is doing it or not The Guardian paints a pretty clear picture of what appears to be occurring in the form of [this flowchart](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/1/30/1391108352230/Chelsea-chart-002.jpg).

It's conjecture at this point. 

Documents suggest...

Apparent involvement...

These are not words that can indict Mourinho, Abramovich, or any other senior level club executives of wrongdoing at least outside /r/soccer and pubs where people will undoubtedly discuss how the evil Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich is buying up players economic rights in Portugal through a series of arcane shell companies based in Jersey and Ireland.

the reason why SFE are requesting p60s is that when your parents give us their financial earnings for the 11/12 tax year, SFE will check those figures with the HMRC.

If there is any variance, we will ask for evidence, if the p60s are wrong then you have 3 options:

1. Tell your parents to ask their employer(s) for the 11/12 tax year, to write them a signed letter confirming how much they earned that year.

2. You can write into SFE and request that they use the figures provided initially to work out your entitlement for Grant/Means tested loan. *

3. Apply using a Current Year Income(CYI) form. You can find that form on the Gov.uk website, this can only be used though if there has been atleast a 15% drop in income from the 11/12 tax year as it would use 13/14 tax year instead.


*You can only do this if the HMRC are saying that your parents earned a LOWER amount to which they stated, ask your parents to call up and find out.

true,h4l,null,null,"Something to remember which may reduce the stress: There's no harm in going around two (or more) times if you need to. For example, if you realise you need to take an exit as the last second it may be easier to just go around again. Then you'll know when to move into the outside lane to take the exit. If you keep indicating right you can go around as many times as you like.

Similarly if you need to get into the outside lane to take an exit but can't because someone is in the way, just go around again.

This also works well if you have no idea where to go. You can happily drive in circles while you read the signs to work out wtf to do. Roundabouts are much more forgiving than normal junctions if you bear this in mind. For example, if you find yourself approaching a roundabout but have no idea which exit you need, go for the right turn. Once your on the roundabout you can do one loop working out where to go then leave on your next loop.

Another time this is can be useful is on a single lane road if you have an idiot tailgating you. If you come to a roundabout in this situation, go around the roundabout once before leaving on your exit and they'll have sped off to piss of the next driver down the road.

Looping like this can also be used to jump queues in some situations (although it's somewhat naughty and you should feel back for doing it). Say you find a road with two lanes approaching a roundabout. The left lane is blocked up but the right lane is empty. You need to turn left. Instead of queuing in the left lane you can take the right lane as if you're turning right, then go *all the way around* the roundabout and take the left turn you wanted.

Just don't do any of these things on a mini roundabout, you'll look like a nutter.",0,1391125785,null,0,1391126608,0,cf3545b,t3_1wiqnw,t1_cf3545b,t3_1wiqnw,null,1432182582,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

&gt;A friend of mine was petrified as someone torched the building next to hers, she was hit and her boyfriend injured as they tried to flee their flat.

I don't support burning people out of their homes, no, [but our government does](http://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jan/20/pakistan-drone-strike-relative-loses-gchq-court-case).  They claim collateral damage, and since we have no idea of the intent and motives of the people in your example, it's reasonable to infer the same, especially since the evidence suggests the vast majority of buildings targeted were corporate interests and residences were not singled out:

""All of the private homes that were destroyed by fires were as a result of arson attacks on commercial premises which either lay below these homes or adjacent to them. This is certainly not an attempt to justify this activity, but instead to place it in its proper context. People's homes were not the primary or even secondary targets of 'looters and rioters'; else scenes of burning neighbourhoods, reminiscent of organised sectarian attacks in Northern Ireland in the 1960s and 70s, would have filled our screens. Instead they were effectively 'collateral damage'.""

&gt; If they had been able to make crowds disperse, the idea of safety in the mob fade away, with what, a risk of injury to those who didn't disperse?

The simple fact is, water cannon don't work against mobile and flexible rioters, they are only effective against static demonstrations.

I agree that we should not bring up Mata every time we drop points; that would be dumb and very counterproductive, but this match was unlike any match we have played so far this season and we may not see another one like it for the rest of the season. Yes, relegation-threatened teams will come to the Bridge to play for a point, but I feel like this was an absurdly extreme case of that in which West Ham defended to perfection and had some luck on their side as well.

Personally, I thought the second half was screaming for a player with Mata's talents. Jose's ""system"" played no role in the match and I think Oscar is too direct for this type of situation while Mata is much more deliberate on the ball.

We cannot dwell on Mata. He is gone to a rival and we have a great team without him, but what is ridiculous is instantly forgetting the talent he has and how many times in the past two and half seasons he saved us from similar situations (i.e. evidence for such speculation).",0,1391127277,null,0,false,0,cf35shv,t3_1wkkr3,t1_cf35shv,t1_cf357md,null,1432182916,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

This guy is a bottle of wine. He's full bodied, 14%, red vintage wine. He's fully committed to throwing himself in there, he'll leave your mouth - as a striker - dry. He reads the game pretty well and can make some good passes but also corks it every now and then. You don't choose this wine to compliment your meal, this bottle tells you what the fuck you're cooking for tea and how you're going to eat it, mother fucker. His dominance in defence can be good and like I said he's pretty brutal, which is similar to Vinnie in a lot of sense. However Vinnie is your rounded red, perfect for nights in on the couch with your missus or to compliment your Sunday roast. This bottle will leave you with the dirtiest hangover possible. 

Anyway that was fun. He's a lot like Vinnie but without the refined edge. Expect to see a few yellow cards sent his way and our opponents moan all over r/soccer about how that tackle he did on the edge of the box should have been a red card etc. Despite all this however his ability to read the game looks positive, he's young, would enjoy playing around Clichy (both French) stays back I think which would mean Vinnie can keep going up for corners etc. Oh and he's bloody fast. The only issue I can see is him and Vinnie losing communication and Mangala throwing himself into the back of Vinnie who would've cleared that corner away.

true,boothkid,flair8,,"Great reply. 

I think the only way to even start formulating the rules for replay would be to look at precedents set by other pro sports leagues. 

Keep in mind that I'm looking stuff up as I'm formulating this. It's not something I've really delved into too deeply, but I'm bored. 

The NHL, for instance, has video replay conducted by an off-site official only on goals. Even then, there are a few specified cases in which it can be used:
&gt;puck crossing the goal line completely and before time expired, puck in the net prior to goal frame being dislodged, puck being directed into the net by hand or foot, puck deflected into the net off an official, and puck deflected into the goal by a high stick (stick above the goal) by an attacking player.

I think the Premier League could benefit from video replay being implemented in a few areas (goals mostly for me) with a specific set of rules for *when* its available to the referees. 

If I was somehow put in charge of this decision I think I'd do just that. Use it in a limited scope that won't intrude on the game terribly.

I still don't have a good answer for the take-over of a game by instant replay though. If the technology was well implemented and received on a small scale, I can definitely see how people would want more of it though.",0,1391127875,null,0,false,0,cf36272,t3_1wjy32,t1_cf36272,t1_cf31nhy,null,1432183062,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

This included food parcels, not being forced to do prison labor, better visiting rights and the right not to wear a prison uniform. Despite terrorists technically not being under the Geneva protocols.

As for formal declarations of war... We haven't done a formal declaration since WWII as far as I can see. We didn't have one for Iraq or Afghanistan. 

We have, however, taken military strikes against specific terrorist organisations, and governments that supported them. We have faced IEDs, we have sent squads in to nutralise terrorists. We have assisted in drone strikes, land ops and everything in between. At that point, I'm not sure a formal declaration is needed.

Furthermore, I am fairly sure that Bin Laden declared war on the west, with us included.

Plus, when Ministers with devolved powers say somthing and act on it, it ceases to become rhetoric - with the powers given through enabling acts, it can very easily become law.

I also never said that we were at war with Islam. I said that we were at war with prescribed terrorist organisations. If you need to check that list, the Home Secretary updates it regularly. As for how he identifies himself? I have no idea, I wasn't in the court room during the trial, nor do I have the transcripts. What I do know is that he is self-classifying as an enemy combatant.

As for whether it would justify his little crusade, realistically, the media has already done that. No peaceful cleric talking words of tranquility has been given the voice that he has been given. No preacher of love has had his message as strongly seeded as this man in the past few years. In many respects, as soon as he was on TV, and his message was played out to the media, he already had his payoff.

But what I do know is this. If he is a PoW, he's there until the war is over. And this war will never be over. This is a simple side-step that allows us to imprison him indefinitely while avoiding the EU law issues entirely, which is why the judge is waiting for the higher courts to decide on lifetime sentences before he passes sentence.",0,1391127960,null,0,false,0,cf363ko,t3_1wjq22,t1_cf363ko,t1_cf2yyl1,null,1432183092,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0
