But they're not just posting posters. All of a sudden, without warning, a raft of literature goes up referencing the worst civil disturbance in decades with no source or attribution. If you were charged with policing London, given all you know about the history of police tension in the capital, the undercurrent of anti-police feeling from the states as well as a very real set of terrorist concerns, what do you think they should have done?

&gt;They should simply take them down

They don't have that power. Even if they had, they'd still have to deploy someone to do it, using exactly the same resources that they've already used and this would be decried as state censorship.


&gt; and reiterate their stated goal to do a better job with community relations (some evidence of this would be nice too).

Perhaps using the medium of posters? Was that not what these posters were designed to protest?

If it's true, then he's got a legal case on his hands for unfair dismissal as, despite the government and the media's attempts to paint employment law as a communist scourge, it still exists and it's illegal in the UK to sack someone and replace them with someone prepared to do it for a lower wage.

And the ""blame"" comment was in relation to the statement ""immigrants can't get jobs because of other immigrants"". Not sure what that is if it isn't blame, but I'll accept that you didn't mean it that way. However, the point is that it's not because of other immigrants that people can't get jobs.

I may do the same thing for my kids' future birthdays, or just specify no gifts at all.  

I had the problem at my son's 6th birthday party of people not RSVP-ing.  I saw a couple of friends after they had received the invites and they informed me in person they would be coming, but other than that only had one RSVP.  I had one family with two kids RSVP and then not show, and several people that hadn't let me know show up.  It was very frustrating.  Another family had three kids (7,4, and 2).  I specifically made the invite out to just the older two, as we were having a Nerf party and I didn't think the youngest would enjoy it, and it would likely be scary for her.  The invite was clear that it was a Nerf party and there would be guns.  The older two kids even asked the day of the party if their little sister could come, and I said, no, I didn't think she would enjoy it, and I wasn't set up for activities for toddlers.  The way they asked made me think their parents had told them the youngest wouldn't be joining them and they were wondering why, so it didn't occur to me to clarify with the parents.

Lo and behold, mom and dad drop off all three, and the little one cried for the first 20 minutes and every time a dart came anywhere near her.  I spent pretty much all of my time dealing with her when I would have liked to be taking pictures and at least getting to watch my son enjoy the fun.  We ended up with, like 2 pictures.

I am considering reverting back to how we did it before where we invited one or two families with kids my kid's age over (or out) for dinner and dessert.  We did that when my kids were young enough to not care to ask for a party.  I told our friends to not bring gifts, it was just a chance to socialize and let my kid feel celebrated.  That way I was calling them and asking them personally and the whole family was invited and fed, so supervision wasn't an issue.

Full information can be found here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-28834192

When you start relying on the government to raise families you begin to see problems left right and centre. They live in the biggest meritocratic society in the world, people born into poverty rise up out of it in their millions. I would be extremely happy living there knowing that violent criminals are justly punished for their actions, and knowing that mine and my families safety is more secure as a result of it.

The problem with the UK is that we put too much emphasis on rehabilitation, when it's abundantly clear certain criminals have no hope and no chance of ever making something of their lives, and it would be to the detriment to society as a whole if these people were permitted to live amongst regular, law abiding people. By all means give a human a chance, but one chance, not 5 or 6 or 10 chances, in and out of the criminal and justice system for years on end. We all suffer, both physically being more likely of being on the receiving end of violent crime, but more important our collective mentality suffers too.

As a football match, Man City against Accrington Stanley would be played fairly, 11 v 11, same goal posts, etc.

The fact that Man City are full of multi-millionaire world class players is irrelevant to the issue of fair competition in a football match - which is the analogy with a car race.

I think some people forget what Rodgers is capable of. I'm just going to give you one example and thats Luis Suarez. Suarez scoring record for Liverpool before Rodgers came in wasn't amazing and a lot of LFC fans were wanting Suarez to play as a attacking midfielder as they didn't feel he was a good enough goal scorer. Rodgers built the team to his style and obviously worked a lot with him in training and made him the 3rd best player in the world.

I doubt 3/O2 will happen, since 3 is already in bed with EE for its network infrastructure through MBNL and O2 with Vodafone and these would be nearly impossible to split.

false,lordweiner27,null,null,"A state is analogous to a family, a business or an interest group in respect of immigration.  
All the members of those institutions have rights, responsibilities, privileges and benefits etc. etc.  
The organisation or the members in general must be able to decide who can join and under what terms they can join.  This is necessary so that the organisation functions well and the rights and privileges can be upheld.  
For example a business decides who it hires and fires.  If a business decided to hire everyone that walked in the door it would quickly collapse.  Families decide who they extend the family rights and responsibilities too.  For example, I would give my brother a lift to the airport I wouldn't do that to a random stranger.  If my brother got married and his new wife was a bitch then she may not get included in the circle of trust.  
Unlimited, unrestricted immigration takes away the sovereign right of the people of a country to decide who gets to join their club.  Society functions well when people integrate well, understand the rules and provide a lot of value.  For instance, businesses seek out intelligent and hard workers who would fit in with the company culture.  
 
All UKIP are arguing for is to have the same policy for EU citizens that we have for the rest of the world.  If you are against that for pragmatic reasons that is fair enough.  But we talking about principle and philosophy.  So if you're for unlimited immigration from the EU out of principle then you must be for unlimited immigration from everywhere.  

Let me explain what would happen to our society if we allowed that.  Millions of people from all over the world would head to the UK.  At first it would be mainly lower middle class people from Africa and India.  But then gang masters would start to bring in other workers.  The poor and the sick would scrape together their life savings for a one way trip on a boat to the UK, hearing about our incredible benefits, job opportunities and free NHS.  One billion people in the world earn less than a dollar a day.  Working a minimum wage job hear would give them enough money to provide for their whole extended family back home.  The government would start to build houses at an increased rate but it wouldn't be fast enough.  Huge shanty towns would appear just outside cities with some workers travelling in by bus.  Crime and violent crime would rise.  Rich people would start to emigrate followed by upper middle class people.  The government would cut child support to the bone, unemployment benefit would go, the NHS would be replaced by an insurance system.  With ten of millions of people from the third world to support these benefits would simply be unaffordable.  Lower middle class and then working class native people would emigrate.  Business men and gangmasters would hole up in fortresses.  Eventually, the foreign aid budget would be cut.  The economy would shrink and shrink and Britain would turn into a third world country.  Then a dictator would overthrow the government and threaten the world with our nuclear weapons.  

If this sounds extreme, then that's because unlimited immigration is an extreme policy.  It's the equivalent of Amnesty International allowing KKK members to join, a business hiring everyone that walks in the door or you inviting every homeless person in the city to eat with your family every Sunday.  

TLDR: There are ties that bind us.  Culture, rights and responsibilities.  Immigration should be on our terms, no one else's.  

EDIT: In addition: You have to help yourself first.  You notice I said that the foreign aid budget was cut?  The richer you are the more you can help other people.  I'd love to raise the foreign aid budget, and the best way to do that is to make ourselves richer.  There is no point in beggaring yourself to help someone because then that is the last person you can ever help.

**Work:** Reasonable countries will make it easy for Britons already working in EU countries to keep their jobs.

**University:** British students will have to pay the same fees as non-EU international students. 

**Retirement/Leisure:** Individual countries will probably work out deals with the UK to ensure that Britons can continue to spend money in their countries. 

**HOWEVER**, there is a possibility that the UK would want to have the same deal that Iceland and Norway have with the EU: Norway and Iceland wanted freedom of movement, but didn't want to abide by EU fishing regulations. So they agreed to pay membership fees while forfeiting any say in how the EU is run, so their citizens can work in the rest of Europe and vice versa. If the UK were to strike a similar deal, then things could stay pretty much as they are. Not sure if the UK could ask to limit immigration *to* the UK in such a deal, though: if the EU let one country do this, then I'd imagine it could mean many other countries will attempt to do the same.

Yes some lineup cards and subs have been head-scratchers, (see: Dejan Lovren) but again, hes not on the pitch, hes not kicking the ball around, the players ultimately win football matches, not the coach. When is the last time youve seen a club with inferior average players and a world class manager win anything in top flight football?  
  
It doesnt happen. Our players are playing below the level they should be competing at. Its as simple as that. Yes formation plays a particular role in keeping players away from the action or out of position, but its a far lesser role to play then actual world class talent and skill. (see: David De Gea)  
  
Name me a club off this list that LFC have more world class talent then:  
Man City    
Man United    
Arsenal   
Tottenham  
Chelski  
Real Madrid  
Bayern Munich  
FC Barca
PSG  
  
When you combine a lack of talent with players that are not performing at a level they supposedly should be its a combination for inconsistency and poor play.  
  
BR is safe. But I will say imo he gets one more season of not qualifying for CL. If that happens this season then it better not happen again for a looong time.

Of the 38 enquiries about the workings of the DA Notice System, many concerned issues not covered by the DA Notice code and about which DA Notice advice was never offered.  These included, alleged NVCJD and child abuse cover ups and an allegation apparently made by Caroline Lucas MP that a DA Notice had been used to 'gag' the media on reporting on the 'Occupy Democracy' protest movement.  As always, there was no DA Notice involvement in any of these cases, and the allegations had been strongly and unequivocally refuted.

http://www.dnotice.org.uk/linkedfiles/dnotice/records/minsofautumnmtg7nov2013.doc

During the last 6 months the Secretary had responded to 16 enquiries about the workings of the DA Notice System: from the media themselves, officials, academics, fringe organisations and members of the public. Several of these enquiries were triggered by concerns that the DA Notice System was being used/abused to cover up crimes or abuses by senior members of past governments. It was in the nature of the internet that a scurrilous accusation can be made without any supporting evidence and then be taken up by other equally eccentric commentators as ‘gospel’. There was little that could be done about this, and the Secretary said that it was rarely wise to try to refute such accusations as that was often cited as confirmation that the allegations were true. 


http://www.dnotice.org.uk/linkedfiles/dnotice/records/minutesofmeetingon7may2013final.doc

During the last 6 months the Secretariat responded to 24 enquiries about the workings of the DA Notice System: from the media themselves, MPs, officials, academics, fringe organisations and members of the public. Several of these enquiries were triggered by concerns from members of the public that the DA Notice System was being used/abused to cover up crimes of paedophilia by senior members of the Government that had been unearthed during Operation Ore and related police activities. The Secretary said we must accept that enquiries about ‘D-Notice’ involvement in alleged official cover-ups would continue, partly because there were many scurrilous websites alleging (without any evidence) such misdoings and which continued to be believed by some. Another case occurred in March when a member of the public demanded – ‘under the Freedom of Information Act’ – details of the ‘D-Notices’ used to prevent media reporting of coastal erosion in East Yorkshire caused by maritime mining for sand and aggregate. He – like all other such complainants - was assured that no such ‘D Notices’ had been issued nor would they ever be, given the terms of the DA Notice code and our free media.

false,multijoy,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;to take down a poster? come on, let's employ some common sense. Of course the police can walk up to and take down a poster (that is illegally posted)if they see it.

Really? But you've just referenced freedom of speech and the right to protest. Given that these posters have appeared in 'Adshel' stands on bus stops, who's to say that someone hasn't paid to display them? Even if they haven't, you're looking at civil trespass - it's not a police function to say who can post what in these hoardings. Same with flyposting - although it's criminal damage, it's not for the police to start pulling them down. Can you imagine the outcry if they did?

&gt;Already said, just remove them and move on! What good will come of spending tons of money/resources to find out who did this? 

The primary function of police is the prevention and detection of crime and to keep the queen's peace. Surely it is entirely reasonable that they investigate what appears, on the face of it, to be an attempt to stir up public feeling in favour of the 2011 disorder?

It's not as simple as 'take them down and move on', because these things get really complicated really quickly, specifically because you're trying to balance the tension between the rights to protest and the need to prevent crime and disorder. You're damned if you do, and damned if you don't and everyone thinks you've made the wrong decision regardless of what you do.
&gt;&gt;I suggest that a bigger waste of resources is being deployed because there are kids making a noise in a park

&gt;I hope not, as of course that also is a waste of resources.

And this is precisely what happens when PCC's (or the Mayor's office for London) say 'you *will* deploy to instances of anti-social behaviour', because Mrs Miggins won't half get the arse if nobody turns up.

25M for Lallana was BR wish if we are to believe Pearce from couple of months ago. Balo was not his choice but his choices fucking failed and he was the only option left. And while Manquillo and Moreno look like the committee, Lovren doesn't.


We obviously tried replacing Suarez with as much as we could, but the problem is the injury to Sturridge, last season was special for him and he wasn't injury free even then. 


Despite this, all that has happened since is on BR. The players he has, how he uses and motivates them, how he sets up etc. I'm not buying this BS as it doesn't begin to explain the fucking horrible soundbites from last season that are still embarrassing him and the club, nor the ones that are coming out this season. Nonetheless, 100% behind the guy, he can set up good attacking sides, can motivate young players (when bunch of 10M prospects aren't forced on him), he just needs to have an actual assistant manager that won't sugar coat his problems, someone who has strengths where BR is weak. Hopefully this season he will realize that and improve the side next season. I still expected more from him with regards to fixing the problems with our attack, like not go from 1 striker to the next or zero striker until it works, but work with the players into a system that picks the best player.

The division isn't between 'Northern Ireland' and 'Southern/Republic of Ireland', it's between Protestant and Catholic, and it exists in the south as much as in the north, but since 90% or so of the south is Catholic, the division was basically forgotten and Catholic Irish became known as just 'Irish' and the greater influence of Protestants combined with different circumstances, especially the Troubles since partition created the idea of a 'different' Northern Ireland.

Also, Belfast is quite different architecturally from the other cities in Ireland, north and south, one thing I notice from people from the south who just go to Belfast they say 'oh, it feels so British', when in reality, the other Irish cities are much more similar to British cities than Belfast which feels more American than anything IMO, but they're just ready to assume any difference is because it's Northern Ireland.

But our argument, is that it isn't our problem - but without going the the CSA, we are hampered.

She has spoken with the charity mentioned here, and the joint agreement has now been cancelled and she has her own agreement for all debts in her name (which we take responsibility for).

One thing we are now worried about, is if he doesn't make his payments then there will be a charge against the house / mortgage.

We are trying to get things straight internally before we have to deal with him, as he has previous of running his mouth off to the children and taking it out on them (we can't do anything today as I have to give mummy lots of money etc).

But I wasn't that into soccer when the MLS started, so I didn't pay a lot of attention to the Metrostars. 

By the time I became interested enough in soccer to care about the MLS, the Metrostars had become the Red Bulls. And while I know in general sports are very commercialized, to me that was just a step too far. I suppose it doesn't help that I find Red Bull disgusting, but I also just couldn't bring myself to ever support a team that's *name itself* was an advertisement like that. I just feel like even saying ""I'm a Red Bulls fan"" is kind of like advertising for Red Bull, and I think it's gross. 

So when I heard NYCFC was forming, I was excited pretty much immediately. Finally a New York MLS team I could support without feeling like I was a walking billboard for some shitty sugar-filled energy drink!

&gt;

&gt;The __Suzuki SX4__ is a [compact car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_car) developed jointly by Japanese automaker [Suzuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki) and Italian automaker [Fiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat). In some European markets the SX4 is sold as the [Fiat Sedici](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_Sedici), and in some Asian markets as the [Maruti Suzuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maruti_Suzuki) SX4. It was designed by [Giorgetto Giugiaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgetto_Giugiaro)'s [Italdesign Giugiaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italdesign_Giugiaro) studio and has been produced since 2006.

&gt;Although originally intended solely for Europe, the SX4 is sold in most of Suzuki's international markets. It is available in [hatchback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchback) and, for some markets, [sedan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile\)) body. Especially in the hatchback version, SX4 occupies a specific market niche of [Mini SUV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_SUV) [crossovers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(automobile\)). Depending on the market, it is available with petrol engines in the 1.5–2.0 litre range, and Fiat's 1.3–2.0 litre range diesel engine. The hatchback is also available with [four-wheel drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-wheel_drive).

&gt;SX4 competed in the 2007 and 2008 seasons of the [World Rally Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rally_Championship), within the [Suzuki World Rally Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_World_Rally_Team), but the company withdrew from the competition.

Two years out it will probably be time to start rethinking his role, but remember that two years ago about half this sub was talking about how Terry was done and that we needed to let him go. 

And don't give me those ridiculous stats on Gerrard. An astonishing number of his assists came from set pieces, his goals came from free kicks and penalties, and his inclusion in the team of the year was more in recognition of Liverpool's overall performance (Which we are seeing now was way more dependent on Sturridge and Suarez than Gerrard) rather than his single contribution to the team. Liverpool's defensive issues last season were more evidence than any other that the team was being shaped to extend his career specifically. He was played out of position because, like Lampard, he couldn't cut it in his old position anymore and had to be moved deeper. 

On your last point, I agree. Zouma might be ready in two years, but I don't think Zouma and Cahill will replace the leadership that Terry brings and that worries me. We need someone else, but at the moment I'm not sure who. Not just in central defense either; Luis will be 30 and Ivanovic is older as well.

I have tried powerline and don't think much of it. There are a few problems.

In the UK we use ""ring mains"" meaning the sockets are wired on a big loop. This means two ""paths"" for the electricity or signal, and causes signal reflections when trying to send data over the cables.

If the two plugs go via the consumer unit (from say, downstairs ring to upstairs ring) they are probably going to go through an RCD which will reduce the speed significantly.

If you use surge protected adaptors and extensions, they will either block or attenuate the signal, reducing your speed more.

Business men and gangmasters would hole up in fortresses.......... Then a dictator would overthrow the government and threaten the world with our nuclear weapons.

I kind of did a double take. I don't think there is any evidence to suggest this would happen. Certainly not from history (although given that we haven't kept accurate records for very long and human 'history' is a few thousand years at best and devoid of any really scientific methods as they would be recognised in the social sciences it's pretty hard to draw any conclusions from history in my opinion). I'm not so sure on economics - I think based on your approach you'll get the answer you are kind of looking for. The analyses of research on that topic here 


http://leedsnoborders.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/open-borders-the-case-against-immigration-controls-teresa-hayter.pdf

draws that conclusion anyhow. I think if you were looking for an evidence based polar opposite to your view you couldn't do anything better than that PDF. I was looking for something similar from yourself in terms of evidence for the position.

In terms of a coherent philosophical basis I more meant the way that all the mainstream parties (not so sure about UKIP I'm so confused as to what the positions are) contradict themselves. The Tories are all about helping businesses and encouraging competition. But they believe an awful lot in nepotism and allowing monopolies to exist unchallenged. They also seem a lot more fussed about helping big business rather than small local businesses, start up entrepreneurs and whatnot.   Bah I'm rambling. 

Basically the GP has quite a well establish philosophical basis that is much more set in stone than the policies. If you don't buy the parties policies, but buy the philosophy, I'd consider joining as the process to change policy is fairly straight forward (and hopefully will become more so if people in the party like me get their way and we introduce online voting on policy). You can find it here http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/philosophical-basis.html

Most of it can be directly related to the policies of the party, I don't find that with any other parties. They don't seem fussed about evidence or philosophy (principle might be a better word) but just what'll get them in power next election.

You've given me an interesting metaphore though to start, although I totally doubt everything you are saying after ""Let me explain"" I find it interesting. Give me a sec. Long post.

EDIT: Long reply to metaphore

&gt; A state is analogous to a family, a business or an interest group in respect of immigration.

Right off the bat I’d argue this point. A state is something very new, we’ve had families for a long time, since the dawn of man certainly, over 200,000 years. The state is very new. Since written language? Not long before, maybe 5,000 years. The state is very much shaped by philosophy, by discussion, debate, politics. The family is pre-programmed into our DNA you could argue. I’d say the family is a much more established and better understood phenomena than the state which is constantly changing. For one thing it is only the past 200 years or so (if that) that our world has been totally covered by various nation states. Until then it was possible to pass from somewhere relatively ‘stateless’ or lawless, into a nation state.

I think maybe at one point the state was a family, a family that was one of a small number of families, surrounded by hostile families and orphans (for want of a better term). Now it is not in my opinion, now it is like that family has gone to a big wedding of a relative, and is surrounded by other people it is related to directly, there are no more hostile families or orphans. Maybe that’s overly optimistic. To extend the metaphore, the family is at the wedding and we've got sodding great bouncers who are keeping the trouble makers from the problem families or the people with no families at all out, or at least make sure at worst it’s only kids who sneak in and maybe pinch some of the wedding gifts or something. We don’t need to worry about the ISIS family gate crashing the wedding and interrupting the best man’s speech or anything like that.

I guess what I’m trying to say first of all is that you are thinking of our family being far to small, we can no more restrict migrants and refugees from France than we can from Scotland or from Zimbabwe ultimately. If Zimbabwe is producing a large number of people that our country couldn’t handle, then we and all the other nations have a moral duty to sort those problems out, and sharpish. I think that the elimination of the poverty that plagues so much of the worlds population and leads to refugees (a far bigger problem, if indeed migration is a problem, than anything leaving the EU would do to tackle). 


&gt;The organisation or the members in general must be able to decide who can join and under what terms they can join. This is necessary so that the organisation functions well and the rights and privileges can be upheld.

At some point however the organisation needs to expand to extend the business model. Jim’s Cookie shop can’t just be Jim and the deliver girl Sam and the baker Abu forever. At some point they have to accept if they want to play in the big leagues they need to join the federation of small businesses for the contacts and contracts that’ll bring in. They need to join some kind of insurance scheme and conform to the required health and safety standards. Maybe here there is an argument that the decision to do that shouldn’t just be made by the boss Jim, or more to the point the bosses dad whose now left the company, I don’t think a lot of voters today were even alive when the decision was made to join the EU. I’m with you on that count. I think we should have a referendum on the EU membership. I just would want us to vote yes (at least at the moment maybe on closer examination I’d change my mind).

Anyhow yes I guess I agree with this, but also feel at some point a decision may be made to not decide at such a ‘low’ or regular level. I don’t think you’d advocate regional migration control, such as between Yorkshire and London (or as it is described here in the promised land of Leeds ‘the problem’). Given the changing nature of space, and requirement for much larger governmental bodies, the boarders should be getting wider if not less strict at the least.

&gt; For example a business decides who it hires and fires. If a business decided to hire everyone that walked in the door it would quickly collapse. Families decide who they extend the family rights and responsibilities too. For example, I would give my brother a lift to the airport I wouldn't do that to a random stranger. If my brother got married and his new wife was a bitch then she may not get included in the circle of trust.

Yes I get this, if you gave lifts to the airports to all total strangers you’d never get very far from the airport either. Not many people walk through the doors of some businesses though, sometimes businesses will do just that, hire the first person to apply for a position (although maybe that is in a time of economic growth long gone). Ultimately though I agree, we should have some restrictions when it comes to protecting our safety and what not. I think even the ultra ‘left’ Green manifesto says *﻿MG207 Regions or communities must have the right to reject specific individuals on grounds of public safety.* http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/mg.html

&gt; Unlimited, unrestricted immigration takes away the sovereign right of the people of a country to decide who gets to join their club. Society functions well when people integrate well, understand the rules and provide a lot of value. For instance, businesses seek out intelligent and hard workers who would fit in with the company culture.

Again I’d go back to the widening of the boarders argument, unrestricted regional migration takes away the sovereign right of the people of a city to decide who gets to join their club. I’m still not so sure this is completely true. Those people are people who still have to abide by the laws of that country, no country is obliged to allow someone to enter the country without requiring that they obey the laws of the country. I don’t think people should be able to migrate here if they are not going to follow the laws. As soon as they do I think they should be locked up and either deported or rehabilitated, whichever is best for everyone as a whole (including their country of origin).

TL:DR I’m tired I’ve rambled. But I like the way you’ve put the argument. I guess ultimately I’d argue that you cannot compare the isolated family unit to the interconnected massive civilisation we have very recently become. Aside from that I’d agree on the need for controls that protect people as a whole both in the country they are migrating too and from, just that they probably don’t need to be that strict and only really concern criminals, not ordinary working people.

I'd check the lovely big history video, we are an exciting time in universal history, we need to change things up and sharpish.

We're a club that doesn't have a huge stadium, stupendously rich owner or bags of money. But we overachieve. We're earned a Champion's League place three times. The first we lost it because of some dodgy food poisoning on the last day. The third we lost it because Chelsea finished sixth but got our CL place because they won the CL. The second was magical.

Anyway, here's some good links: 

* [Our champions league season, in which we finished top of a group including the holders and later knocked them out in the R16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLr2mTfem3o)

* [Awesome video about what we are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv1s5YBDd7g&amp;list=UUW6hU7HT80vwRvLwhR9CULA)

* [Gareth Bale, our star player who left us fro a world record transfer fee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu6UVbwnBCE&amp;list=UUW6hU7HT80vwRvLwhR9CULA)

* [Video summarising last season fairly well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pr1x7qo3rKM&amp;list=UUW6hU7HT80vwRvLwhR9CULA)

Important Names:

* Mauricio Pochettino/Poch/Mr P/MP. Our manager, joined us after a great time at Southampton.

* Daniel Levy, our chairman. Notorious for great deals such as Eriksen for £12m, and awful signings like Soldado for £26m.

* [Christian Eriksen, our star outfield player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Es1YXxI_Us). Top midfielder in the league for goals and assists this calendar year. Absolute steal at £12m.

* [Hugo Lloris, in my opinion third best goalkeeper in the world.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcPQqqxtIy8) He's also beautiful.

* Erik Lamela. He cost us £30m and has/had huge potential. However, he's been largely disappointing.

* [Nabil Bentaleb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTeys7Y6qzw). Son of previous manager Tim Sherwood. Hugely promising midfielder who only just turned twenty. Came through our youth academy.

* [Harry Kane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XTtPGCVBsQ). Probably our best striker, he came from our youth academy and is a legend. Scores goals, works hard for the full ninety, [and can even play as goalkeeper.
](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhBuZGIm4g)

* Roberto Soldado. £26m striker. Doesn't score.

There is, rightly or wrongly (mostly wrongly) a growing negative attitude to EU migration into the UK. This is why UKIP (right wing party promoting withdrawal from the EU) is gaining ground in the UK recently.

The worst of this attitude is directed, it seems, at eastern europeans, especially countries that have recently joined the EU.

The government are trying to eliminate the ability of EU migrants to claim certain benefits after the recent german court case, this means that potentially you have no social safety net.

Your employment experience will vary from those good employers that will judge you purely on your merits, to those that will be covertly or overtly racist and find an excuse not to employ you.

I think most employers would want to meet you, your most reliable route would be to plan an extended holiday over here and try to find work. You would need an SIA license for security work, you can't get around that, but you may be able to apply for one easily.

It's a shame you werent looking a few months ago, as Royal Mail were doing their annual xmas recruitment drive for the big sorting office in filton, would probably have been good for you.

Your driving license will be fine, more than fine because they can't take it off you for speeding ;)

A flat in Bristol for £400 is either a dump or located in the bristol equivalent of syria. I pay £600 a month for a small one bed in north bristol that I share with my GF. You could get into a house share for the £300-400 mark.

My housemate and I have been very ill all week with asthma following a cold. For her I called 999 when she became pale and so breathless she could not even speak, the ambulance crew were very nice and said while she did not need them they went through the process of sorting out a ""Walk In"" appointment for her (juggling lots of calls).

Meanwhile I called 111 for myself, was assessed and told ""Go to A&amp;E"". Knowing I was not as bad I explained I needed to simply join the same ""Walk In"" as my housemate. A local Nurse called back, ran the same assessment and said ""A&amp;E within the hour"".

The 111 assessments do seem to err towards getting you infront of a medic rather than fobbing you off.

Then the nurse got a doctor from the Walk In (at a different hospital) to call me and she said ""Yep just make your way here"".

Everybody was professional, nice, quick and effective. Just as they always are when I speak to NHS staff (I've used 111 several times since inception).

At the hospital my housemate skipped the huge waiting queue as she'd been put through on an emergency, even though I came in with her with the same complaint I had to wait over an hour. BAH!

But overall it was another case of ""I love the NHS"".

He is still making under handed comments to French media about wanting to play in the Champions League etc, its just something we have to face.

Im sure if Clyne continues to have a good season / keeps his England right back position, the same thing will happen. We also can't guarantee that our two very decent loanee defenders will be with us next season either.

I think there is alot of thinking that needs to be done about that area alone. Lets not even talk about our striker problem which may sort itself out once JRod comes back, hopefully he hasn't forgotten how to hit the net.

&gt;For the striker situation, I like the option of maybe going with Milner, but what would be more natural for me and even though not in my lineups, I would give a shot to Scott Sinclair.  He is a winger but for Swansea in the PL scored 8 in 38 in the 2011-12 season, with only 2 in 43 in other seasons in the PL, not the greatest of records by far but he is hungry. Navas has scored in comparison only 4 in 34 for City, and is more effectively used running on the wing. Silva 23 in 143 but last season scored 7 in 27, better than Sinclairs record. Nasri with 32 in 184 PL games hitting 7 in 34 last season, arguably our most proficient of these in front of goal?

Edit: Maybe even Yaya as a replacement CF? He tends to go forward at the end of matches anyway, he's strong, not the most prolific work rate of the midfielders, proven in front of goal. I can't see a reason why not to try?

The usual reasoning behind lowering population growth is environment, resource conservation, and shrinking the wealth gap. Not something conservatives usually go for... 

There's a great doc that points out, on a global scale, what is happening with the world's population growth, why limiting it might be beneficial, and what happens when a country's population decreases. Hans Rosling is a doctor and statistician, he's worth a listen:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UbmG8gtBPM

One thing pointed out here is that the general trend is that poorer people have more children, so it's not totally ridiculous to stop subsidizing folks who can't afford the extra kids. If one group is having disproportionately more children that they can't afford in the first place, it's not unfair to stop rewarding it. Paying people to have kids, who can't actually afford the ones they already have, might not stop child poverty, after all.

I know many parents that are struggling, and they don't give a second thought to having another as they think they already have the resources from the current kids, and it would only be an extra little boost financially. I know one girl, in her mid 20's, that has 8 kids, and 0 interest in ever working. She's a lovely person, but her attitude at this point, with so many, is simply more kids = more money. She'll never have to work, the kids come subsidized, and another one for her is just a drop in the ocean...

I pay taxes in three countries, and one of them (not UK) has recently given me a big rebate accrued over nearly 5 years.  If I can unintentionally put money elsewhere outside their tax jurisdiction I can certainly legally do it intentionally.  I know plenty that do.

If they want cash rich, self sufficient migration they'll have to make it attractive.  If they don't (in which case I wouldn't be there anyway) then they won't and people will migrate for Summer/Winter elsewhere.

Failing that there will always be a way.  There always is.

*Purely anecdotal but I know someone who worked in finance in Paris  who cashed their chips in early to move South and to get out of the rat race (and probably to remove all reason for having to fly into Charles de Gaulle ever again).  Being nowhere near feasible retirement age and wanting to put into his new community despite other projects he put himself up to be a local councillor.  Considering his background he decided to look into the local economy to see if he could lend some expertise to improving it.*  

*So he sets about with public records and produces a study in the local economy which was rural but also quite posh.  He said he was specifically looking at what could be improved outside the local British and Dutch expat population which is large but not intrusive.  That it appeared very seasonally reliant.  So how to develop the out of season economy.  He found that 50% of the local economy was the public sector, and of the remainder over 70% was connected to the expat population or tourism.  I told him he must have made a mistake.  He shook his head and said ""No"".  His next word was ""Property"".  He'd included property sales into his local economy, and all the middle market and upwards properties were being snapped up by the expat community, then using local builders and tradesmen.*

*He'd gone in desperately wanting to help develop other parts of the economy beyond agriculture, the public sector, and money which came in British wallets.  His findings were, to paraphrase him, I can't fix what isn't there to start with.  That any meaningful economic reform for his local economy, again his words, had to be based around the British and Dutch population, regardless of what happened EU wise.*

Now, I'm quite willing to accept that his might have been an outlier but even so it illustrates just how important British migration has become, and how it is being fueled by what is effectively a property bubble at two ends.

Because the average voter no longer cares.

None of the parties are really ""different"" since the advent of ""New"" Labour and nobody fights for the common man and woman anymore.

Hence the arrival of one Nigel Farage who claims much and (so far) achieves little. Yet he says what people want and as far as I can tell has the full intention to go through with it for better or worse, as opposed to current politicians who say one thing and have a giggle about it off camera.

People are so disillusioned with the system that people don't understand who they are voting in and then act surprised when the Tories start selling the soul of the nation. It's ludicrous but it's what they want. The less people know about the truth, the more benefit the politicians can reap from it by blinding society.

Unfortunately we don't have the power to make that decision, the buffoons we vote in do and of course, they won't change.

The only way we can change it is one of two ways;

Not voting for a major party at the next election (but that risks bringing in someone who is inept and incapable of running the country and will ruin us)

Or not voting and having such a shitty turnout that no meaningful vote can be carried in which case, chaos will ensue. However, people value the right to vote far more than they value the actual decision they make when voting and therein lies the problem with modern society; people cry freedom and possess it like their favourite doll but then don't know what to do when they have it and act like rabbits in headlights.

It's difficult to reconcile. Sadly. We won't get out of this without voting out the big three (two) but we risk running into something far, far worse if we're not careful.

Not so, there *are* shareholders...

&gt;""Up until 1946 when it was nationalised the Bank of England was a private run bank that lent money it created out of nothing to the English government and was paid back with interest.

&gt;A very famous story relates to the Bank of England and the infamous Rothschilds, that all powerful banking family. This story was re-told recently in a BBC documentary about the creation of money and the Bank of England.

&gt;It revolves around the Battle of Waterloo in which Nathan Rothschild used his inside knowledge of the outcome and his faster horses and couriers to play the market by getting the result of the battle before anyone else knew the outcome.

&gt;He quickly sold his English bonds and gave all the traders who looked to him for guidance the impression that the French had won at Waterloo.

&gt;The other traders all rushed to sell their bonds before the market crashed thinking that they were now worthless and a massive fire-sale occurred as brokers clamoured to get rid of their stock. This massive sell off quickly drove the price of the bonds down to 5% of their original worth.

&gt;Once the bottom had dropped out the market Nathan Rothschild then re-bought as many bonds back as he could at hugely discounted prices and in doing so he multiplied his wealth twenty times in 3 days of trading.

&gt;At the same time as becoming immensely wealthy he also became the single largest debtor to the English government which ultimately gave him control over the bank of England.

&gt;English bonds were a debt guaranteed by future tax revenue of the English government, therefore the taxes the citizens paid were going to pay the 8% interest that the English government had to pay to borrow the money.

&gt;As Nathan Rothschild now controlled the majority of the English bonds he could determine the price and therefore the supply of the English currency which gave him great power over the countries finances. As he famously said afterwards.

&gt;“I care not what puppet is placed on the throne of England to rule the Empire. The man who controls Britain’s money supply controls the British Empire and I control the British money supply.” - Nathan Rothschild

&gt;Privatisation of the bank continued for years until the bank of England was nationalised after the war in 1946.

&gt;*However because the government was broke after the second world war they didn’t have enough money to buy out all the shareholders so instead they were issued with government stocks*.

&gt;*Although the government now earned money from any bank profits they also had to pay interest on any new stock they issued to pay for the shares they couldn’t buy back in the first place.*

&gt;In 1977, the Bank set up a wholly owned subsidiary called BANK OF ENGLAND NOMINEES LIMITED, a private limited company with 2 of its 100 £1 shares issued. The objectives of the company are:

&gt;“To act as Nominee or agent or attorney either solely or jointly with others, for any person or persons, partnership, company, corporation, government, state, organisation, sovereign, province, authority, or public body, or any group or association of them….”

&gt;The two shares belong to the bank itself and John Footman who only holds it on behalf of the bank. The directors of this private limited company which is a subsidiary of the bank are John Footman and Andrew Bailey who are both employees of the bank itself.

&gt;*This company is very special as its protected by the official secrets act, its Royal Charter status and is exempt from the normal disclosure requirements that other companies have to comply with to meet section 27 of the Companies Act 1976.*

&gt;*The reason being is that the major players in the world of finance including the Queen of England and other Royal families use this company to purchase shares and remain anonymous.*

&gt;However the Bank of England Nominees company accounts are not exempt from any laws regarding companies and they must print their accounts as every company must do which can then be accessed through the Company House website. It is interesting to note however that the latest Bank of England Nominees LTD accounts say that:

&gt;“There has been no income or expenditure on the part of the Company since its incorporation and accordingly no profit and loss account is submitted.”

&gt;It still also has total net assets of £2 (the £2 shares).

&gt;However even though the Bank of England is now state owned its important to note that up to 97% of the UK’s money supply is privately controlled being in the form of interest bearing loans created by the big commercial banks."" (sic: My emphasis (from [here](http://www.darkpolitricks.com/2013/01/who-owns-the-bank-of-england/)))


Interesting to note The Bank of England is worth only £2 (according to the value of it's shares anyway), and that 97% of the nation's money supply is privately controlled (loaned at interest so more is owed than is brought into existence).

So the lending at interest (97% of the nation's money supply) is now done by the commercial banks, isn't that just a case of ""a rose by any other name...""?

Oh, and the other point of note (for me anyway) is that everything's secret ""to protect the Royals and their investments"" (that alone is as dodgy as fuck IMO).  ;)

**The assumptions are based on the Treaty Structures** which dicate what Brexit is and hence how:-

1. Repeal The European Communities Act 1972
2. Invoke Article 50 TEU Lisbon Treaty

The first provides no legal cover and would likely be a mess and hence would doubtfully even get to that stage due to opposition.  Invoking Article 50 provides a 2-year negotiation context to such as the OP's question. The scenarios can be categorized:-

1. WTO
2. Bi-Lateral
3. Efta/EEA

1 and 2 simply are not workable due to requiring &gt;2yrs. If Efta/EEA then it does not change anything as Freedom of Movement of Labour is part of the EEA Treaty 1994. Obviously there would likely be a few things to sort out but in effect no change would be mutually agreeable for all, in general.

What the OP therefore has not understood in asking this question and indeed what ALL the answers have done is not understand how the Treaty structures work.

It's not really a great idea to use stock images if you're supposed to show how great your skills are, and it's not a great idea to use very few or no images because who the hell would hire a decorator with a shitty website?

So if you need to start a business like that, you budget for a years' worth of rent, hoping you'll build a list and portfolio before closing up shop and moving online (or just to word of mouth). But most of your working time will hopefully be in clients' homes or at home, sewing. (Like if you use an industrial machine, you don't really want to move it if you don't have to, so you continue to sew at home.)

It helps nobody by bringing it up.

I kind of agree with the decision to drop Mignolet, even when our backup keeper is no better. Rodgers has to do something, Mignolet keeps getting worse. At least there's a chance Jones surprises, and it also sends a message to Mignolet.

I don't think our defense is fixable at the moment. I'd pick Manquillo over Johnson, but even then he's a 20 year old who is going to make mistakes, but at least he's got the pace to get back and defend. LB seems like our biggest weakness... we've got no LBs who can defend. Moreno leaks goals, and Enrique is no better. Flanagan might be our best option once he's fit. Then there's our CBs... dear lord... so many mistakes. Hopefully once Sakho is fit he'll start, but that only *potentially* solves half the problem.

I was more referring to this. I do see what you're trying to say but what we have now (or the alternative with a DoF) is really the structural realization of ""speaking to the owner or director"". Since BR said no to a director, apparently, I think FSG didn't have any other option than to make him talk to 5 different people. It makes a lot of business sense. John Henry doesn't know the first thing about scouting, football management, or the value of football players, so just going to him would be silly.

I mean it places absolutely all the blame on a faceless transfer committee while holding BR responsible for nothing.

It mentions that BR was overruled on Vorm and so now there is no competition for GK. What about the fact that Liverpool got rid of Reina for next to nothing, ostensibly because Rodgers was a bit offended at not being named the best manager Reina's ever played for. 

Rodgers drops 20M on Lovern (who was undoubtedly a Rodgers buy) and ships out a player like Agger, who if nothing else brought leadership to the team (and I think most would agree would be preferable to Lovern on current form).

More than anything else Liverpool's failings this year haven't been down to individuals it's been down to tactics. We're just as bad defensively as we were last year and we've lost all the goals. I remember last year whenever Liverpool conceded a sloppy goal in the post match press conference BR's favorite reply was that it was an ""individual error"" which is bullshit it's a symptom of BR's tactics which he has stubbornly refused to change.

All that being said I'm not on the BR out brigade, I think that would be another year to two years down the drain and I don't see any replacements that seem like a significant step up from Rodgers (Benitez and Klopp are the only two names I've heard that seem like improvements but I think both are unrealistic).

We've been losing far too many games in the centre of the park and this comes down to a lack of physicality along with intensity. Pairing Can and Henderson together, two box-to-box midfielders, where Hendo's intensity coupled with Can's physicality should start to help us start to win the battles in the middle of the park, especially when they are supported by the nous of Lucas. Defensively, this team should be extremely compact and difficult to break down, something which I have been stunned at Brendao's inability to do. 

As for the offensive side of the game, its all about Balotelli holding the ball up and having Sterling, Markovic, Hendo making supporting runs in behind and around him.

We know the Twelfth Doctor vaguely recognizes his new face but can't place it or understand why he got it. As viewers, however, we recognize it as the face of both Caecilius from The Fires of Pompeii and Frobisher from Torchwood: CoE.

Despite his Time Lord instincts telling him that the man was fated to die, the Tenth Doctor allowed Donna to talk him into saving Caecilius and his family. As a direct result, Caecilius had descendants that he would not have had before.

One of those descendants was John Frobisher, who went on to play a pivotal role in events which deeply hurt a close friend of the Doctor's-- Jack Harkness. Because the Doctor had already irretrievably tangled the time lines around Frobisher, he was unable to intervene against the 456 without tearing reality (a situation nearly identical to the one surrounding Amy and Rory being trapped in Manhattan).

The Doctor now wears Caecilius' face as a reminder to himself of the unforeseen consequences of interfering with time.

Personalty I think it is a bit of both. At 16, and earlier, you form ideas on how the world should be run based on your current life experiences. Over your life these ideas get modified, weakened, strengthened, or even dropped as you leave your idealised childhood world-view far behind.

As I said in an other comment there is a maturity difference between a 16 and 18 year old. At 16 a year or two is a long way away, you don't really plan that far ahead. Heck there might still be petty school yard dramas going on! At 18 a year or two is not that far away any more, and you start to consider your future a lot more seriously. You do look back that the ""drama"" that occurred when you were 16 and you realise how petty it was.

Yes the voting age is arbitrary. Some people either mature or form political beliefs more quickly than others. But having the voting age at 18 is sensible as people have been out of compulsory education for two years. They have matured in these two years. They have seen and/or considered the real world for two years.

Using your definition of what defines a right to vote of being an age where they are ""deciding the path of their own careers and futures"", we should give the vote to 14 year olds. After all they are choosing their GSCEs which can affect their future.

You might have noticed that I said that the voting age of 18 is sensible when earlier I said that it should be raised to 21 again. I have no problem with the voting age being 18; but when MPs are toying with the idea of raising the age of compulsory education to 18, then I begin to question it.",0,1418684497,null,0,false,0,cmvyue7,t3_2pctjc,t1_cmvyue7,t1_cmvusp3,null,1425382685,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

So, Brad Jones in goal. I was going to put Mignolet but it seems I underestimated how terribly he was doing.

I've gone with three at the back. 

I chose Sakho because I really rated him in France; he takes the LCB role since he's left-footed.

Skrtel takes the CB role since I believe he's the weakest link and most out of form.

Toure takes the RCB role because I've heard he's in form and he impressed me against Manchester United.

Emre Can takes the DCM role, with his movement arrows showing how he'd shield Manquillo's defensive deficiencies and attempt to cover the rest of the back three (mainly Skrtel). He'd also get forward on rare occasion.

Steven Gerrard takes up a central midfield role, and would be involved in keeping posession prior to a counter attack. After offloading the ball his only role is to drive for the box, and get back if possession is lost.

Countinho plays at the edge of this midfield triangle, and would operate between the oppositions lines evading challenges while trying to seek out the runs of Borini and Sterling. Should a pass not be forthcoming we can see that Henderson and Gerrard will be on hand to buy some time to rethink the approach.

Manquillo should be bombing up and down the left wing all game; he seems to be at his most dangerous when he's wide, so I haven't shown arrows for him to move inwards.

Borini and Sterling play as to wide forwards, with Sterling occasionaly falling back to be parallel with Countinho. They would be fluid in their approach and constantly look to drag defenders with them or confuse the opposition in terms of who's responsibility it is to mark them.


For example, say Borini starts in the space between the oppo's LB and LCB and Sterling starts deeper; in front of the oppo's RCB. 

As Countinho receives the ball; Borini runs across goal (marking responsibility shifts from the LB and the LCB to the LCB and / or RCB) and Sterling moves diagonally into the space between the RCB and LCB. 

This would hopefully cause the opposition's defense to falter, and Sterling or Borini can be slipped through.

I thought there were changes in how data was collected, I recall a little media storm because of Boris making some bullshit claims, that turned out to be as hard to accurately refute as to prove.  I only really looked at the last few years statistics.  It's difficult to tease out real data, reported vs unreported, what is violence and what isn't.  Is increased knife due to difficulties of firearms.  Plus whenever I'm looking at stats like those I always get sad around the war on drugs, I can't comprehend how any *moral side* can consider it a good thing, except certain criminal gangs of course.

I do also worry about the wikipedia article, the sources are not that apparent.  As for the race issue, it's definitely a factor, no one can deny, the issue is again correlation vs causation, is it a race thing, or just a poverty thing or even lack of family development.  It's very complex for sure.  Much like harsh prisons and crime, some places like Singapore have low crime, yet very barbaric prison systems, others like the US have that yet high crime.  I definitely thing in some places immigration has not made the situation better, as you've had an influx of even poorer, sometimes desperate people.  I was chatting to a former hippy type drug dealer I've known who claims to have lived in my area for 20 years (I've only 8 so don't know) he definitely considers a certain east europe gang to have taken things over, for the worse in his mind.

I've seen various people say that the BBFC has given advice to ATVOD that they are willing to accept pain up to the limit of ""trifling and transient"" (see R v Brown for where that comes from, i.e., it is the limit to which one can consent in England and Wales).

&gt; ""penetration by any object associated with violence""

This is in the category of things viewed as a risk if people try them at home (like, say, putting a dildo on some power-tool).

&gt; ""Strong physical or verbal abuse, even if consensual, is unlikely to be acceptable""

This is complicated. Some of this almost certainly falls into the category of things that the CPS guidelines pertaining to the OPA, some falls into the category of COPFS guidelines pertaining to depictions of rape, and some falls into moralising. As far as I understand it, in general provided it's legal the BBFC cares primarily about it being obvious that it is consensual (probably because of the COPFS guidelines).

&gt; And as above, the CPS guidelines - certainly when it comes to things like fisting, do not necessarily reflect what is actually illegal.

And this is an important point. One can argue the merits of basing the BBFC guidelines on CPS/COPFS guidelines (versus having legal advisers interpreting case law themselves), but really those guidelines do need to change.",0,1418687889,null,0,false,0,cmw0onl,t3_2pdnrc,t1_cmw0onl,t1_cmvz4e8,null,1425381826,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Basically if you want a brief definition it would be that Primary Legislation or Acts of Parliament are made by the legislature (Houses of Parliament in our case) and declares new rules whereas Secondary Legislation makes those laws a reality and puts them into effect sorting out all the admin stuff that needs to be done before the Primary Legislation can be put into effect. 

This Primary Legislation, once passed by a vote, delegates power from parliament to the government or executive (the Tory/Lib Dem coalition in our case) to pass Secondary Legislation or Statutory Instruments/Rules/Regulations etc. 

These pieces of Secondary Legislation execute and administer the Primary legislation putting it into effect.

So for example parliament may hypothetically pass a new law called the Press Standards Act (2014) which aims to introduce new standards for the press. It will be passed by a vote in the House of Commons then the Lords and then it will be made law. In that act it will say something like:

&gt;1. A body corporate called the Independent Press Standards Organisation will be created

This Act does not create the IPSO but merely *delegates the power* to create such an organisation to the government. The government will then write a Statutory Instrument to execute this section and create the IPSO at a time of it's chosing. They don't need to vote on it because it's already been debated and voted on in the form of Primary Legislation. But they will also make another Statutory Instrument to define the rules that govern the organisation and another Instrument to define the methods by which directors are appointed to the board of directors and several Instruments to amend previous legislation so that it all refers to the new organisation and not the old organisation etc etc. So every Act of Parliament will be followed by a rush of little SIs enacting every part of it and amending other laws to make it all fit. 

They normally lay a statutory instrument before Parliament for a short while to ensure everyone is happy then as soon as it's published it becomes law but it's only enacting or enabling something that's already been passed. 

SIs can also be used to amend Acts. This is what happened regarding these porn regulations. An SI called the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 was used to amend the 2003 Communications Act to include on-demand porn services in the group of media regulated by the BBFC. Because it was an amendment thus only tweaking an existing Act it did not need a whole new law just an SI which is written by the government. The government has the power to do this because each Act of parliament delegates that power to implement and amend that act in the future. It makes little amendments and trivial execution orders easy because you don't need to make a whole new law with votes and report stages etc. They are incredibly useful and very commonly used. The vast majority of legislation passed by parliament is Secondary Legislation. In 2013 Parliament passed 33 Acts of Parliament and in the same year passed 3,314 Statutory instruments. As far as I know you can't pass a Statutory Instrument without reference to an Act of Parliament that is being amended or implicated.

Mostly they are incredibly boring and meaningless but in the case of the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 a small amendment has led to a rather large change in the law so it is naturally more controversial. MPs have the opportunity to annul the regulations but as I said in that comment above Labour and the Tories were behind this one so it was never going to get annulled.

I had mortgage meetings back in marchish time and was told I had a really good credit score. Something like one below the top level. 

So having a phone contract will be good. Forget the overdraft, that'll do nothing. Get yourself a credit card and buy stuff with it, but make sure its stuff you can pay off. This way it shows you will repay your debts. That's the important thing. That will build a credit history up.

However, in all these cases there is an element of ""if this were not in a sexual context, it would be far more likely to be allowed"" - which is another area where moralising comes in.

Unfortunately there's no pressure on the BBFC, CPS or COPFS to change their guidelines and consider what is and isn't legal (and what should be allowed). Ideally what we'd have is a whole host of test cases, that would set out whether or not the OPA test has any clear principles behind it, and then a good bit of appellate court case law to clear up things like Brown - which may or may not be applied as rigorously 20 years on. Particularly given that it was decided mainly on public policy grounds (contrast with.. iirc *R v Wilson* from only a couple of years later which found a way around the principle in Brown).

I have no faith in us to make a good decision on this front. The worst part of it is that we are in a position where we need so much more from our scouting/academy/signings than the teams we are trying to compete with.

We have top 4 ambitions, but we pay relatively low wages compared to United/City/Chelsea. We don't have the same attraction due to lack of CL over a number of years.

Honestly, I think that energy of Markovic and Moreno down the wings would be much more effective than our right/left backs at the moment. They both have the pace and energy to play forward but also get back.

I believe that Balotelli would do much better as a single striker if he has two wingers/attacking mids backing him up and playing balls into the box for him.

Lucas, because he's the only thing that's worked for us defensively all season.

Henderson would thrive in the middle of the pitch, and he's also in a position where he can roam the field and chase down players and the side doesn't lose a lot if he's out of position.

Skrtle is horrible ATM, so the only other 3 CB's we have are Toure, Lovren, and Sakho.

Jones needs to be on the field so Mignolet has time to rest and regain his confidence.

The one consistent principle and philosophy that UKIP have is localism and direct democracy.  In other words they believe that decisions should be taken by the people and as close to the people as possible.  
Their position on immigration is consistent with this as 80% of people support their policy.  
Other positions consistent with this include:

Localism - Devolving power from Westminster so communities have more say in how they're governed

Exit from the EU - We can't begin to take hold of important issues whilst we don't have our own sovereignty, and when the right to govern lies in Brussels

MP Recall - A procedure by which voters can remove an elected official from office through a direct vote before his or her term has ended

Direct Democracy - Proportional voting, national and local referendums, so voters can be engaged and have their say heard

They also supported AV and devo max for Scotland long before the referendum.  I imagine there is a lot of shared ground with the Green Party on these issues?

I agree most of their other policies are far from philosophically consistent.  They are a big mix.

No one showed up at my birthday this year either.  I'm in my late 20's, and all my friends went to a Halloween party instead of my birthday party.  It kinda sucks.  My little brother felt bad for me and made me a cake.  I know how you feel. 

I know how it feels to be let down by friends.  However, please rejoice in the fact that (as of 12/15) 2834 strangers on the internet saw the pics of your birthday party and are insanely jealous.  Like, grown adults who could be doing anything in the universe right now really want to be at a party as cool as yours.  I wish my birthday party was half as cool as yours.  I made copy your birthday party for my party next year, if you don't mind.  

Stay the better person, and be like the doctor would be; go to their party even if they didn't go to yours.

I would give Brendan an ultimatum. Either accept a Director of Football (my choice would be Monchi from Sevilla) along with the TC, or he can leave. Furthermore, he needs to play the players he is given. His choices of Borini, Allen, Lovren, and Lallana are all overpays and  do no inspire much confidence. Additionally, he needs to accept systemic changes to his coaching. It seems this year with CL he has not been able to coach the same as last season. Fine. But he also has not done anything to fix our defense, rather than throw money at a LCB, which we already had. I would demand a defensive coach, preferably one who knows how to play a high line and offside trap. An Italian would be my choice. 

Depending on the results of that I would go from there. If Brendan decides to leave the coaches I would target would be Bielsa (not coming till summer at best), Favre (same), the Augsburg coach, and fuck it Ill jump on the De Boer train. 

As far as personnel go i would demand that Lovren, Skrtel, Johnson are all gone as soon as possible and replacements brought in. maybe a Dortmund CB not named Hummels and Schar on a free from Basel (I think). I would see if Cech would be avaible in the summer, and if not I would target Brad Leno or any number of other talented up and coming German keepers.

As for school, she's in inclusion classes with an intervention specialist to help her along. She talks a bit about having some friends, but for the most part she prefers to just spend time with us and our adult friends. It's a huge step forward for her because she used to hide away when anyone came over. Also, she's become ridiculously affectionate.

I'd say Phillips needs to be playing elsewhere in January, be it on loan or otherwise, but that would leave us short due to the tardy realisation that it's perhaps a bit wiser not to overpay on a weekly basis and monitor transfer spend. I'll be eternally suspicious of Hoilett's vision and hamstring, but he showed today why I am a bit mystified that Fer has been consistently played on the left instead of him. Joey Barton should probably be getting a weekly salary on a level with Henry. I'm not sure what Mutch does yet. A younger, slightly faster version of Gary O'Neil?

On the positive side, Vargas has some beautiful footwork. I also think Fer has some great technique, but I worry that people will turn on him like they did to Mbia. They also didn't drop their heads at 3-0 - it could have been worse if they had packed it in, and with every shitty away result like this, I think goal difference might well come into play during those last few games. I thought we were OK for periods, like OP says. Maybe it would've been a different game had we scored when we were looking menacing early in the match. The problem is as much as we can play Steve Black's game and point to small bundles of positivity, at some point you have to step back and accept that 0 points from all our away games, with that loss to Burton fucking Albion as the garnish, is beyond pathetic. There's a thread on /r/soccer now over how abysmal our Premier League away record is. That doesn't even count the circus that developed in the second half of last season. Maybe QPR players just get too comfortable in the tight confines of Loftus Road, and can't settle into games away?

I recall a lot of people screaming down negativity last season by appealing to our league position in the top 6. The shoe is on the other foot now. Nonetheless I have every bit of confidence that we can beat West Brom and Palace at home, and QPR probably represent excellent value for your ticket money at Loftus Road.

So at the end of those three years your best bet will be to apply for a marriage (""fiance"") visa. If the relationship isn't serious enough for marriage, it's probably not going to be serious enough to convince the Home Office that you're in the UK because of her instead of the other benefits of life in Blighty.

So it really is Skype and visiting a lot (both to see her and to prove you deserve a marriage visa). I think you can visit for up to 6 months, but you certainly can't work on a visitor's visa.

Drunk guy who I was sort of interested in gave me my first kiss and tried to have sex with me. After my tired groggy self pushed him away, he stopped. Never spoke to me again after that.

I just turned 22 last month, no party in sight. Those people are not my friends anymore. I'm not into the drinking as much as they always are and I feel like it's always high school drama with them.

If you're like 15 yards out or more then yes, it would make sense to lift it as you could potentially get it over the keeper or curl it around them (which works better on a lofted ball) and it's far enough out that you don't gain as much from keeping it low since the keeper has enough time to get down. When you're inside 15 yards to about 5 yards out then keeping it low makes sense because as long as you get it beside the keeper it's very hard for them to get down to it in time. When you're within 3 yards of the keeper then you need to pop it up a bit as they'll likely have most of the angle cut down and you won't have a lot of room to get it on either side of them. Any good keeper knows to get low in this instance as you need to make it as hard on the strikers as possible, so you don't want to give any freebies right between your legs or beside your feet. It's difficult for a striker, especially if they're running fast, to get a delicate little chip over the on rushing keeper while keeping it on target and with enough pace it can get past the keeper without them being able to react to it, but if executed it's the most likely shot to go in. Look at videos of Messi and see how often he just dinks it over the keepers that come out to take the angle out. The key is distance between the striker and the keeper, and in most of these cases (especially Sterling's first) the better option would have been to lift it a bit. Balotelli could have kept it low and gone near side on the pass from Markovic with some power, but it would have been just as good to go up and far side.",0,1418695397,null,0,false,0,cmw4nkg,t3_2paz34,t1_cmw4nkg,t1_cmvzcrx,null,1425379907,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1
false,Jai1,null,null,"&gt; On a recent television programme, Shinzo Abe was asked about one of Japan’s most politically delicate topics: immigration. Given that the population is shrinking and fewer than 2 per cent of residents are foreign, was it time for the country to throw open its doors?
&gt; The prime minister’s answer could hardly have been clearer – or more disheartening for advocates of a radical new embrace of outsiders.
&gt; 
&gt; “In countries that have accepted immigration, there has been a lot of friction, a lot of unhappiness both for the newcomers and the people who already lived there,” he told the audience, as he held up a white signboard marked with a red “x” to underscore his negative position on the issue.
&gt;
&gt; Aside from neighbouring South Korea, no wealthy country has combined a low birth rate and tight immigration controls the way Japan has. The country’s labour force began to shrink in the mid-1990s, and the total population peaked in 2008, at just under 130m. If nothing changes, there will be 30m fewer Japanese by 2050, and by the early 2100s – admittedly a distant extrapolation – the population could be half or even a third what it is today.

whats next is unclear. 

Liverpool has played according to their strikers talents (Fowler, Owen, Torres, Suarez, Sturridge and even Carroll) in the time that i have been watching this team and at the moment there is no clear plan dictated by a striker. 
Balotelli is good but his attributes are not as defined as Torres and Sturride who have great movement particularly on the ball and a good finish, Carroll had skill in the air and Suarez.

What do Liverpool do at the moment? Last season we played directly on the break. In BRs first season we played possession football. Under Benitez we centred our team around a superb midfield trio and discipline. When we have played at our best (let alone as a club) we had an identity. As all good premier league teams over the last decade have. 

What our best move is to get this footballing image back im not sure. It could solved by a new player, a new manager, a new coach, a new plan from FSG in regard to signings. But the sooner we figure out what we want to do, not over the next 6 months but over the next 6 years and work towards that, the sooner things will start falling into place. 

In the short term i feel a good keeper with experience (Cech or Vorm) is imperative, and if a striker with a set of standout attributes comes on the market then we should sign him.

Our place always looked like some enchanted land from whatever holiday it currently was.  We had parties constantly, etc.  In the summer we went ALL over New England to museums and parks and stuff in our beat-up car.   As I got a little older I noticed fewer and fewer people came over.   The worst was about 2 years before we left the neighborhood.  One of my friends was dropped off to play, he had his bike with him.  We were about to go riding around when the mom pulled back in and said she needed the bike back. My mom asked her why and she said that she just didn't feel comfortable with her son in that neighborhood.  Then she took him away as well.  I never saw him again.   


I never really knew we were poor, or working class or whatever, until that moment. I mean I *knew* about the stuff that went on.  I remember not having heat in the winter, and my mom baking muffins or whatever every morning so we'd have some heat.  Or my mom not eating 3 meals per day so I could have all I needed.  I knew we somehow didn't qualify for aid because we had a car. Didn't matter if it had a small hole in the floor we covered with a board, and no reverse.  But I had no scope.  That was just life.  My mom and my dad made sure that I never really **knew** for as long as they could, what the life we were living was.  The next couple years after that time with my friend and his bike were rough, because I knew EVERYTHING and knew what it all meant.  I heard the insults, I heard what wasn't said, I heard what teachers really thought of me.  Maybe part of it was because I was about 10 that day, and was getting more aware and older, but that moment played a huge part in it.  

In a couple years my dad's job improved drastically, as did my mom's, and we eventually got out of that neighborhood and ended up being middle class, or even upper end of middle class. But I never forgot that day.  If I ever dupe some poor woman into having children with me (I'm 33 so that window is close to closing at this juncture) those children will never know what it's like.  But I'll make sure they appreciate it, so that if they see a young version of me somewhere at school, or playgroups, or parks, that they don't look down on them. 

This actually the first time I've ever told anyone any of this.  But I understand, and I'm sorry the other moms did that to you. You don't deserve it.  Your daughter doesn't deserve that.

I agree with you on Lukaku. He's good when he stays forward and he got an assist anyway, which is fantastic. Either next game or the following if he plays in a similar fashion to today he'll end up scoring.

I have no idea why this is, and hopefully when kompany comes back they will finally figure out that no one can be more aggressive than kompany, for better or for worse. His aggression leaves gaps, making it necessary for mangala/demi to play solid and conservatively, something they havent really done alongside of kompany so far.

&gt;

&gt;__Scapegoat__ derives from the common English translation of the Hebrew term *azazel* (Hebrew: עזאזל) which occurs in [Leviticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviticus) 16:8 after the prefix *la-* (Hebrew לַ ""for"").

&gt;And Aaron shall place lots upon the two he goats: one lot ""For the Lord,"" and the other lot, ""For Azazel.""

&gt;In ancient Greece a cripple or beggar or criminal (the *[pharmakos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmakos)*) was cast out of the community, either in response to a natural disaster (such as a plague, famine or an invasion) or in response to a calendrical crisis (such as the end of the year). In the Bible, the goat for Azazel was a [goat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat) that was designated (Hebrew לַעֲזָאזֵֽל *la-aza'zeyl*) to be outcast in the desert as part of the ceremonies of the [Day of Atonement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Atonement), that began during the Exodus with the original Tabernacle and continued through the times of the [temples in Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_in_Jerusalem).

The Lib dems on the other hand promised the exact opposite, yet they voted the torie way anyway. Really the issue here is the Lib dems complete inability to play the political game, you have your first real taste of power so you need to prove to voters that you can be trusted and you will stick to key vote winning pledges. The lib dems however decided to dig their heels in and get the tories to back them on an utterly pointless AV referendum that nobody wanted, as opposed to digging their heels in on a policy that clearly the public cared strongly about. Even if they couldn't persuade the tories to back down on this issue they could have saved a lot of public face by publicly speaking out against the bill (like in this article here) and making a show of not supporting it (refusing to back it, even collapsing the coalition, while not good for the country it would have been pretty good for the Lib dems) instead they projected an image of compliance and lack of interest to their key voting demographic.

false,myonlinepersonality,null,null,"Hi,

The responses to each of these questions aren't mutually exclusive - I strongly suggest you get a chartered accountant to give you some formal advice.  Here's my tuppence worth:

You don't say how you have 'invested' the £12,000.  However I'm going to assume that it is via a Directors' loan because that's the most sensible way of doing it.

You also mention that the company is doing 'OK' - I assume then that it's profit-making so you will have both distributable reserves in the company and a corporation tax liability.  When considering effective profit extraction we need to work out the company's total profits, which in this case would be: Trading profits + Profit on disposal of lease - tax.  Once that figure is established, a profit extraction strategy is worked out based on your personal circumstances - i.e. what tax bracket you are in, how much of your CGT annual allowance you have used etc.

In response to your specific questions:

1&gt; If the lease is held in the name of the company, the disposal will be a chargeable gain.  The calculation of this varies depending on the type of lease, how long it has to run and whether you paid a premium up-front.  Broadly the gain calculation would be £40,000 - 'wasted' lease premium paid - professional fees.  You would pay corporation tax on this at 20%.

Entrepreneur's relief if payable on the disposal of business assets by individuals - so if the lease is in your names personally (and this might well be the case) then ER would on the face of it be available as an associated disposal because the lease was 'used in your business'.

Entrepreneur's relief is also available when a company is would up and dissolved and the assets of the company are returned to the shareholders as capital distributions.

However, I'm pretty sure you'll be stumped because the company hasn't traded for a year.

2&gt; I assume you're talking about the bonna vacantia procedures.  Yes, that's correct.  On the assumption that ER isn't available then if you have less than £25k in the company the winding-up process is a lot simpler.  You shouldn't simply spend on personal items and expense them to the company - this should properly be treated as a distribution from the company to you by the company (i.e like a dividend).

Whether you should pay income tax or CGT depends on your personal circumstances.

3&gt;  Yes, you can.  And if she isn't isn't employed elsewhere this would be worthwhile.  You should also transfer some shares to her in order to use her annual allowance for CGT (£11,000)

4&gt;  Do you have other sources of income in the tax year? If not, then yes this is a good idea.  You will also get a £2,000 credit for employer's National Insurance.  The result of this is that you're better off paying yourselves about £10k each.

So, in summary:
1.  Assuming the company owns the lease, the company will have to pay tax on the disposal.  The company will also have to pay tax on its profits to date.
2. Of anything that's left, if you have your personal allowances intact, pay yourselves £10k each.  You should transfer shares to your wife and appoint your wife and pay her too  (this is slightly risky as HMRC might challenge and ask for evidence that she actually worked for the business)
3. Next, you wind up the business.  At this point anything is distributed to you as 'capital'.  You have already transferred some shares to your wife so that when the CGT on the shares is calculated it uses her entire personal allowance.
4. Of anything that's left you will pay CGT at  18 or 28%.

Note that when figuring out how many shares to transfer to your wife you need to consider not only using her personal allowance but what happens to any extra - i.e. if she is a higher rate taxpayer but you are a basic rate taxpayer it would be better for you to be treated as disposing of any shares above the annual allowance - or vice versa.

NB&gt; there aren't any implications of transferring shares between spouses.",0,1418699919,null,0,1418700361,0,cmw75ev,t3_2pevzt,t1_cmw75ev,t3_2pevzt,null,1425378743,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

false,youcanfeelme,null,null,"Watched this right after [The Culture High](http://vidzi.tv/l9qiox4f9e5f.html#.VI-VedkgGc0) and together they're two of the best documentaries I've ever seen on drug prohibition. Pieces everything together and shines a light on how rotten the whole system is regarding this issue and reminds you how much it's decimating our societies. Really makes you want to do something about it. 

This documentary gave a much needed UK focus though whereas the culture high is more American focused but still very relevant and I really recommend watching it to gain an even better perspective on this issue. 

The part in this doc with Kelly and Sam really touched me. I have grown up around addiction, alcohol, heroin, I've lived around it. There's always pain behind it, there's always a troubled past. Naturally, I too have my addictions. It's a self perpetuating cycle of misery and remedy. Making it a crime makes everything worse 

I've seen it destroy lives, watch people rot away in front of you and nothing you can do about it. I've seen alcohol turn my mum into a shell of her former self. I've seen heroin snatch away stardom from talented people and suck the life out of them. I've had mates stopped and searched and booked just for a bit of weed multiple times on a bullshit trap of ""suspected buglers in the area"" just so some lazy hypocrite copper can have an easy shift instead of solving actual crimes and probably snorts lines of a weekend. I've seen it being used to blackmail in all sorts of professional and domestic situations; no more criminalisation means no more blackmail. I've seen it cause bloodshed and make some very nasty predators very rich. It's all fucked up and it makes me mad 

Would anyone join a sub specifically for UK based activism on this issue or would I be wasting my time? These docs are rare in that they outrage me so much I actually want to do something about it. If more people cared to do something about it they can't ignore it for long

I want to smoke joints with groups of people outside parliament all day every day and let them arrest the lot of us every single day until every last jail cell is full, some old school civil disobedience activism that demands change because it simply can't be sustained. 

That's what I'd like to do, instead of a sit in it would be a smoke in and if the rich conservative people get sick of being surrounded by the smell of weed on their way into work every day we can tell them to talk to their MP about it so we can go home and give them the facts 

It's not just about being able to get high at home with your mates, it's about real people's lives at stake who are dying every day and it's about how making it a crime has destroyed relations between the public and police and has resulted in societies most vulnerable being imprisoned and then truly knocked out of the game. 

It's about the hypocrisy of one rule for the elite and another for everyone else. It's about making nasty predators rich and creating a black market which results in gangs and more death and drying them out. It's about making it a health issue and not a criminal or moral issue. It's about the lunacy of having alcohol legal and outright glorifying it but prohibiting and demonising less harmful substances. It's about doing what's right and what's effective, the status quo isn't helping anyone other than predatory drug dealers, lazy corrupt coppers and hypocritical politicians and elites. 

Nobody is willing to put their neck out for drugs because of the stigma but more people have to start making some noise

The broader point is whether BR wants a DoF is not relevant as it's not his decision to make as to whether the owners decide to stick someone above him in the management chain anyway.  He'd either shut up and get on with it, or quit.  

If he were wise, he'd probably approach FSG and agree that a DoF is needed (say something like the job is bigger than I thought, yada, yada) and offer to help find a DoF for the club.

I'm using it as a metonym. Like how the Blair and Brown governments weren't the Labour party, but you'd still use that term or say ""under Labour"".

&gt; they are a minority administration and the 3 main parties do everything they can to play politics with the lives of the residents there to run the city into the ground and show the Greens to be incompetent.

That's... quite a serious allegation. Most councillors enter the job because they care about their area and want to serve their constituents. If they're making life difficult for the Green Party, it's because they disagree with it and don't think its plans for Brighton are in the best interests of the area.

Thanks for the response from the councillor though - but it doesn't really constitute a clear and consistent philosophical basis for the policy decision to outsource an NHS service. From that, it looks like it's a problem that a publicly run service, as is often the case, is more expensive than it needs to be.

West Sussex is a Tory council - are there no alternatives to working with the Tories? Do the Green party criticize the Liberal Democrats for going into coalition with the Tories? Genuine question.

&gt;It had long been informally known by staff, unions and partners that this notice would be given.

This reminds me of what [Caroline Lucas said on this](http://gptublog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/statement-from-caroline-lucas-mp-davy.html):

&gt;There was no necessity to make this decision earlier today – the existing contract runs until September 2015, leaving plenty of time to seek alternative solutions to keep the service in public hands.

According to this councillor's letter, they had even more time than I first thought to seek out solutions, rather than to be, in Lucas's words, ""forced by the NHS trust to out-source this service to a private sector provider"". The reality is, they couldn't wait to do it. Why did the Green Party seek to involve the private sector at the first opportunity, when nationally they supposedly want to keep it entirely run by the state? Can we really trust the Green Party after this?

The councillor talks about ""tight timescales"", but Lucas seems to think they had about a year left to work it out - is that really that tight?

&gt;I think the reality of the situation is the NHS is being privitised, and one minority administration in Brighton won't change that.

Well it isn't, but anyway the reality is, and this is my point, the Green Party talk the talk about keeping the NHS ""public"", but *at the first opportunity*, when faced with reality, they ""privatize it"". Does this not tell you that they are not a party with realistic governing plans? Does it not tell you that there might be a place for private providers in the NHS, if groups as dogmatic as the Green Party come out in favour of it?

Are we to blame the fact they don't have majority control in the council? The Greens support PR, right?

&gt;What is direct democracy in your mind and where is UKIP's firm manifesto commitment to it?

I don't think any party has a manifesto yet, but on their [policies page](http://www.ukip.org/policies_for_people) it says

&gt;– UKIP will introduce the Citizens’ Initiative to allow the public to initiate national referendums on issues of major public interest.

I think it's a poor idea myself, but I'm not UKIP. It just sounded like the sort of thing a Green Party supporter might like? I just picked the one most likely to have appeal to you - correct me if you like the sound of another one even better. Abolishing the Department of Energy and Climate Change, perhaps? ;)

Their previous manifesto was written when their poll ratings were still only comparable to the Greens', so it didn't really matter what they put. As far as I know, they had some guy write a hundred pages of whatever he felt like because it's customary for a party to have a manifesto at an election. They're really a single-issue party, they want to pull out of the EU. It's in the name. Farage claims to not have read it. I doubt this, personally, and it does raise the question why should we take UKIP seriously when they didn't take themselves seriously in the last election. But whatever, I can wait for the next one.

As for the voting record of MEPs, I don't see what that has to do with anything. UKIP want to leave the EU, and there's massive majorities in the European Parliament that it's not worth turning up to vote just to make it 20% against instead of 17% against whatever motion.

Take a look at that TTIP motion Roger Helmer apparently voted in favour of: [78% in favour](http://term7.votewatch.eu/en/eu-trade-and-investment-agreement-negotiations-with-the-us-motion-for-resolution-vote-resolution-as-.html#/##vote-tabs-list-1). Why would UKIP even bother turning up? Parliaments don't work like that - often votes will go with relatively few people turning up because the vote itself is a foregone conclusion, and MPs and MEPs are busy people who do more than just vote on things. There is nothing wrong with that.

This wasn't even a legislative thing. It says it on the page AAV linked. Who cares?

UKIP want to pull out of the EU - which would pull us out of any TTIP agreement too. Do they need to oppose every negative aspect of EU membership separately? Of course not, you only need to oppose TTIP specifically if you support staying in the EU.

That's not even to mention that the TTIP proposals haven't been finalized, published, or put to a vote yet. It's severely unlikely that the controversial stuff will make it through.

I never found our fullbacks the core of our problem. Johnson is no different. The way today's game is played it's all about keeping a back three during possession and turnover. As in, the defensive mid drops to the defensive line. With lucas in that spot we are rock solid. The wingers and wingbacks are supposed to track back. Johnson does that if he doesn't, then whoever overlapped with him does. He can't be everywhere at once though. Every game since this place has turned he hasn't really been any worse than the rest of the roster. He makes the occasional good tackle, he makes quite a bit of brilliant runs. If you took out gerrard for another defensive midfield or a faster holding midfielder, we'd be fine defensively, and THEN we can focus on Johnson.

I'm one of UKIP's biggest detractors on here - in fact I own and run the /r/UKIP subreddit - but the whole [furore about Reckless saying EU immigrants might have to go home](https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2mr59s/ukips_mark_reckless_immigrants_may_be_asked_to_go/) was because they *have* thought about it.

[Before Reckless opened his gob so foolishly, senior kippers \(including him and Farage\) had discussed this, and were planning to make a deal with the EU, in the event of our exit, that all EU immigrants would be allowed to stay here, as long as all British citizens currently resident in the EU would be allowed to remain there.](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKIP/comments/2n5nx0/reckless_sore_after_shafting_from_farage/)

That's what Reckless should have said and I don't know why he didn't. He shouldn't have talked of some ""transitional period"", he should have said ""yes, I'm sure EU residents will be allowed to stay in the UK, and we'll be seeking binding resolutions that Brits currently resident in the EU will be allowed to stay there"".

I think UKIP are have some stupid policies, and they predict gloriously optimistic outcomes for everything they propose, but it's reaching to say they haven't planned something this obvious.

he started telling us how he had turrets, his parents didn't love him, he had to take care of his younger brother who was neglected by his parents, and how he was (often) suicidal.. he told us a lot of stories about him and his younger brother, and his parents. fast forward a year, and his mother finds and reads his skype; learning that he has been lying to us and she tells us, he doesn't even have a younger brother.. thing is, the depression and suicide (and coincidentally, the turrets but only physically) were very real, and that was the reason he lied to us, he didn't know how to make friends otherwise and got lost in the lies along the way. nearly everyone stopped contact with him, except me. i didn't and still don't, believe in shunning friends because they made mistakes. he kept asking me why i stayed, for years after. and i always said ""because i'm your friend, and you lying to me doesn't change that"".   

he slowly got out of his depression, dropped out of school multiple times along the way, and now has a stable job in a warehouse where he oversees one of the shifts(or something  to that extent). 2 summers ago he paid my plane ticket to come see him for 2 weeks (I'm rather poor), and even though we're separated by an ocean, i can truly honestly say that he's my best friend. being able to hug him in real life that summer is still one of my fondest memories. 

i don't know why i thought that was appropriate for this topic, i just needed to say that after reading about people without friends.

Lloris is presumably yet to reach his prime, but he has a long way to go before he will be as good as Iker, who, along with Buffon, was probably the best keeper in the world until Neuer came along.

false,Patch86UK,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"The main fib in the post is ""least bad option"". Raising fees to £9k was not the only option, nor the best.

The only reason that there was a ""crisis"" in university funding is because the government cut funding to universities by exactly the same as what they expected to raise through the new tuition fees. Universities were formerly funded from the central tax pot. There is precisely no reason why this had to change. It was a decision solely made in the context of sorting out the national budget, and nothing to do with ""a crisis in university funding"". Any other form of tax rise or spending cut could have been used to the same effect, if that was what they had wanted to do. Interestingly, this coincides with a parliament where the top rate of income tax and corporation tax were cut, ISA limits and tax free allowances raised, and council tax frozen.

One of the ironies of the new scheme is that it still sees the government making large payments up front, so that it doesn't even help ""the deficit"" in the short term. 

Even if you accept that the government needed to tap students for more money, there were other options. One was a graduate tax. One of the interesting things about a graduate tax is that, unlike a loan, you could have applied it to all graduates, including those who benefited from a free education (including, Messrs Clegg, Cameron, Osbourne, Cable, Alexander...). You could have made payments on existing loans a deductible expense so that students of the last decade and a half weren't out of pocket. As the number of payers would be larger, the tax rate could have been set much lower than the payment rates on Clegg's loan scheme. Not an idea I recall Clegg and co. arguing for. Possibly to protect their own pockets, but more likely because they didn't want to upset all those lucrative older voters (young people don't vote, right?).

Or perhaps they could have upped fees for foreign students (demand from whom already outstrips supply). Or cut the tax reliefs given to private schools (which would have covered about a fifth of the so-called shortfall by itself).

Perhaps the biggest irony of it all though: it didn't even work. The new scheme costs so much to run, and has such a large number of people that will never manage pay it all back, that it is predicted to raise no more money than was being raised under the £3k per year scheme:

Workers over 18 are usually entitled to 3 types of rest break.

Rest breaks at work

Workers have the right to one uninterrupted 20 minute rest break during their working day (this could be a tea or lunch break), if they work more than 6 hours a day.

Employers can say when employees take rest breaks during work time as long as:

the break is taken in one go somewhere in the middle of the day (not at the beginning or end)
workers are allowed to spend it away from their desk or workstation (ie away from where they actually work)
It doesn’t count as a rest break if an employer says an employee should go back to work before their break is finished.

Unless a worker’s employment contract says so, they don’t have the right to:

take smoking breaks
get paid for rest breaks

Either everyone gets a slice of the cake or each region gets their own cake; the Scots should not get both a slice of cake and their own one.

The argument against EVEL is the argument for shutting down the Scottish Parliament and all the other Regional Assemblies to have a single parliament where every MP is equal.

Either you devolve power to the regions and those regions lose the ability to vote on matters that do not affect them, or you have a single parliament which governs for all. The idea that a Scottish MP has the same weight on English social services and policy when it doesn't affect him as an English MP, for whom it affects all his constituants is insanity.

If the price of the Union is constitutional inequality and an unconditional surrender and acceptance of this by the English then the blame lies with those who created this situation without a solution, not those who are trying to provide one.

Remember that the situation we're talking about is one where an employer has asked employees to perform a certain task for money, so that it can be sold on and profited on.

Having rules around how much you're allowed to hurt employees seems fairly reasonable. Where to draw the line is obviously tricky though. Simply pain? Long lasting marks? Permanent scarring? Burning? Amputation? I think most people would agree somewhere along the line. 

Others are around safety, which again seems like a reasonable aim. While there are other jobs that are dangerous that we ask people to do, the businesses will be under pressure to make them as safe as possible. There being an inherent risk in doing (say) offshore welding is unavoidable, and the justifications for keeping the job make sense. It's a lot harder to argue that you should put your employees safety at risk with the justification ""'cos people want to wank over it"".

Exactly.

Yes, it does shift the burden of payment onto students, but the alternative to tuition fees is to raise taxes everywhere else to compensate and that's going to be both fiscally and politically problematic.

If someone has given birth before (without any complications) and doesn't have any risk factors like diabetes, high BMI or pre-eclampsia, it seems it's a bit safer for them to give birth at home. Home births in uncomplicated women are less likely to require interventions like c-sections, ventouse or forceps delivery. 

Of course you are then risking the small chance of complications while being far away from hospital, but on the whole it's safer for uncomplicated births. However if the woman hasn't given birth before or has any risk factors then it's much better to be in hospital on the midwife or even obstetrician-led centre.

 Pellegrini plays him because he's a true winger and gives us width, without which we are horrendously predictable and easy to defend, see 12/13 for proof of that. He creates most of the space Silva/Nasri get to play in - he forces teams to play a deeper line and defend wide, which means the defenders are further apart from the midfield, and spread out wider. Without him, teams will just play two banks of 4 across the penalty box. Navas and Zabaleta have developed and fantastic partnership because zabaleta likes to under-lap and get in the box and shoot more than overlap and cross.

He's criminally under-rated by most people on this sub, which is weird because elsewhere he isn't. 6 goals and 13 assists in 29 starts is a fantastic return for a classic winger. Not to mention he gave more assists to Aguero than anyone else last season, and this season has massively improved his overall game by putting in some monumental defensive shifts which mean he's no longer a luxury player.

I told the complainant to go home and got the other guy in a room. He was very reasonable, and we had a conversation. He hadn't meant to make the other guy feel bad, but could see how his comments could have done.

Homebirths aren't regressing, they're not just for your 2nd+ children, and they're not the province of hippies and idiots. Having a kid in a hospital isn't always the best thing for mother, baby OR anyone else.

My wife gave birth to our son (her first) at home. The midwives who attended were superb, she did the whole thing with gas and air only, they had services on standby in case anything went wrong (so the comments about how ambulances will take just as long as when you call one normally are just nonsense) and at the first hint of trouble you're moved to a hospital.

In return we got to set the stage. My wife got to spend her (long) labour in comfort, watching what she wanted, eating what she wanted in the security if her own home. She got to control the environment during birth, have everything she wanted to hand, and have the setup just right. She avoided the nearly mandatory inducement which she would have undergone in hospital, despite it not being necessary (her water hadn't broken but the nurses told her she would definitely had been induced in hospital despite it being unnecessary just because it was protocol).

After the birth she got to go to her own bed with her child. I was there the whole time, and at no point was I forced to leave or abdicate responsibility as I would have been on the ward. Clean up was simply and fast, and the midwives helped massively.

Later the day she gave birth we wrapped up the little one and walked 45 mins to have him checked at the hospital. My wife felt well enough and comfortable enough to do so, something she attributes totally to being at home for the birth.

A lot of the ""standards"" in midwifery now are geared to hospitals and in the vast majority of situations are totally unnecessary. And the ridiculous myths about home births just perpetuate bluntly untrue facts about childbirth.

false,HashPram,eng-yorkshire,Yaakshur,"Fair enough. Let's assume that households only buy one copy of a newspaper.

As of 2013 there were [26,414,000](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/family-demography/families-and-households/2013/info-uk-households.html) households in the UK.
A circulation of 2¼ million (i.e. The Sun) represents about 9½% of that total.
While total newspaper circulation (of 8 million) represents a shade over 30% of that total.

There's a complicating factor though, which is that households don't necessarily contain just adults. The point being that if we're going to compare households with some segment of the population then either we need a way of excluding children from the total number of households, or we end up comparing households against the entire population (even though that doesn't take into account the fact that children below a certain age don't generally read).

So let's do that. The total population currently stands at around [64.1 million](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=population+of+the+uk+2014&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;gws_rd=cr&amp;ei=KwiQVKG3PMzvaNmwgrAD).
Sun readership represents 4% of this total, and total newspaper circulations represent a shade over 12½%.

Of course that's an upper bound. The actual figure will be somewhere between the two figures, i.e. 4-9½% for The Sun and 12½-30% for all major newspapers taken as a whole.

And as with all these things there are additional complications.

For one thing 'Household' is defined as ""One person living alone, or a group of people living at the same address who share cooking facilities and a living room, sitting room or dining area. A household can consist of more than one family, or no families if the occupants are unrelated"". Given that, it's not unreasonable to suppose that some households will purchase more than one copy of the paper (thereby inflating the household percentage).  
  
There's also the fact that places such as hotels and the local takeaway will buy papers for their customers to read - this will increase readership (if by 'reader' you include people who idly glance at it while waiting for their food), while not increasing circulation.  

And - to address your point about people reading The Sun - it all depends what you mean by 'reading The Sun'. If you mean ""idly glancing at it while waiting for your takeaway"" that's one thing - on those criteria I am an avid wall-watcher. If you mean ""reading it from cover-to-cover"" then I expect the figure's quite low. Most people will be somewhere in-between - read the headlines, probably the sport, glance at the tits on page 3, ...

Still overall the newspaper circulation is falling a fair bit. The Sun has seen a drop of at least ¾ million since 2010 and 1¼ million since 2000. If it continues to decrease at the current rate it'll have a circulation of about a million or so in 10 years, which means - at least as a print medium - it's fast approaching irrelevance.",0,1418726798,null,0,false,0,cmwg21q,t3_2pdl1t,t1_cmwg21q,t1_cmwfc4z,null,1425374447,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

It's too easy to hide them (so we'd be back to whack-a-mole) and you are taxing something which you want more of.  We want a country full of wealthy people, so why create a disincentive for that state?

Land is a very special case because it's completely fixed in supply.  That gives rise to the special [perfectly inelastic supply curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax#mediaviewer/File:Perfectly_inelastic_supply.svg).  This has the particular property that the burden of any tax falls entirely on the owner (regardless of who nominally pays it).

If you find other similar supply-demand curves for particular wealth assets, then those are the ones to tax; but again the difficulty is finding a particular class that isn't portable and easily hidden.

LVT is also special in that it's trying to tax not wealth but the socially-added value of land over and above what it would be were there no society surrounding it giving it that value.  It's taxing the abstract ""location"" rather than the literal property.  Personally I like to think of it as a tax on the value of the planning permission to use that land in the way it is being used; and then you look on ""planning permission"" as something which is granted by society to the current owner.",0,1418727089,null,0,1418727272,0,cmwg3ya,t3_2pcjk2,t1_cmwg3ya,t1_cmvy2s4,null,1425374422,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

“There is absolutely no way a player will come in here if I don’t want him,” 
“I will always be the first person it comes to. That’s not being arrogant, that’s how we operate here and how it works in this country.
“Abroad it works differently where you have a coach and the club will bring in the players. The coach then works with the players he’s given.
“A lot has been made of it but the fact is the process that happens here is no different to what happens at other English clubs.
“We have a number of people, scouting staff and analysts, who will look for targets who fit the profile of the players that we want.
“Then I will sit down with those guys, look at those targets and make a shortlist from that.
“All that work that goes on is of great help to me. We identify players, gather all the information we possibly can and then if they’re right for what we need it comes down to whether they are affordable and available.
“I know the club will go and do the best it can to get the players we want. But it’s very clear that anyone we sign will be because I want him here.”

Absolutely. You see it every game, the opposition crowds the midfield which inevitably means one of our defenders end up in possession. Then the opposing forwards move up and press. So we either panic and give up possession or hit a long ball (a big BR no-no). Mostly the former. 

The whole point of having a big man up front like Lambert is that he can be an outlet in situations like that - get it up to him to hold up and play in advancing midfielders. But we rarely do that. Lambert hasn't been particularly ""sticky"" for starters. In the first half against Basel he kept dropping out to the wing, taking it into his feet and then... well there's nothing he can do there, he's not skillful or quick enough to dart into the box and there's no other target for a cross.

Psychiatry is the medical study of the mind and they, because they are properly trained are allowed to write prescriptions and evaluate patients medically. 

Psychology, however long it is studied for does not make someone a medical practitioner and the conclusions reached are opinion based on a soft science which cannot be used to reach clear safe conclusions. Their opinion is no more valuable that that of an experienced social worker and should not be held in any higher regard. 

In other words a psychologist has no fucking business ever making the call that someone does or does not have the mental capacity for anything. That is not what their science investigates, that is not what their domain is they are not medically trained and should not be masqueraded as such by anyone including social services.

In 2012 my contract with 3 was about to expire, and I called up and asked to cancel. They offered me a new cheaper contract and a new phone. I didn't want it but my gf at the time did. I asked for a transfer of ownership, and to give her all access/control of the account. 

Almost 2.5 years down the line, I get a letter through the post at my old address (my old flatmate still lives there), saying that I owe them 3 months of bills for the account. Apparently my ex had had enough and tried to cancel the contract. But she couldn't do it because they said she didn't have authorisation to do so. So she just cancelled the direct debit payments.

A few months later, 3 closes the account and sends the bill to a debt collection agency. Thus the letters through the door.

I went into a 3 shop once I found out that the letters had come through, and the guy said that the records showed the operator in 2012 had only put my ex on to the account, and given her access, not actually done a transfer of ownership. This meant I was still the actual 'account owner' all this time. Which is why it's come back to bite me in the arse.

The bill isn't alot, and I can afford to pay it, but I'm just so fucking angry and out of principal I don't want to pay it. Surely if I dispute it they will see that for almost 3 years I've had nothing to do with that account, and I havent been paying for it. After checking on Noddle, it is affecting my credit rating as well (dropped to 2/5).

I know I should probably just pay it and shut up, but then how do I go about fixing my credit score afterwards? How do I dispute it?

The people involved must have an understanding of what Rodgers is trying to achieve and what players fit with that philosophy and that is where things seem to be coming apart. I'd much prefer if FSG's system was implemented but only by people Rodgers has chosen himself as it looks like there's two camps of people in this committee.

HALP!

I'm a little bummed out right now, three weeks ago my skin was basically flawless. Moist, dewy, soft and clear! It was where I needed it to be, and I was just working on getting rid of some PIH. I'd even got a handle on my hormonal acne! [This](http://instagram.com/p/waoo3XCJEN/) is my skin on my second day of work, no filter.

Then I got a job at a Korean restaurant, and it is *so hot*! I'm constantly walking in and out of the kitchen and the BBQ area now my skin is just bleugh. In the last two weeks, I've had four whiteheads. I was able to remove the pus (yuck) with a hydrocolloid, but they still keep popping up. I feel like I'm back to square one with acne, with the bonus of having sallow looking skin! I feel even more self conscious as I'm constantly talking to customers.

Thankfully, this isn't a forever job for me, but it is important to me right now, so I'd like to keep quitting is a last resort. Besides upping my water intake, is there anything else I should be doing? 

I don't wear makeup other than a BB cushion and occasionally a play pencil as an eyeliner. The oil cleansing is for oil control.

My current routine is.

####AM:

- *Oil Cleanse*,  L'Oreal Cleansing Oil

- *Double Cleanse*, Eucerin Dermopurifyer Cleanser

- *Oil Control*,  Hada Labo Kiwamizu Lotion

- *Mild exfoliate*, Eucerin Dermopurifyer Toner

- *Moisturise*, Eucerin Adjunctive Hydrating Care

######PM: 

- Oil Cleanse &amp; Double Cleanse with the same products as AM

- *BHA*, Neutrogena Lotion

- *AHA*, Mizon 8% Glycolic Peeling Serum

- *Retinol*, Nip+Fab Overnight Fix

- *Hydrate*, Hada Labo Gokujyun Lotion

- *Moisturise*, Vichy Normaderm Night Detox

Any advice would be super helpful! I live in the UK, and I'm sensitive to niacinamide, tea tree oil and coconut oil. Fragrance is just a preference to me, and I have no reaction to any glycols or alcohols.

Also, the media industries are very broad and include stuff like craft production design, PR, internet marketing and much much more. 

I would also add that in some sectors, like film and TV, there needs to be more of a push for People of color and low-income backgrounds to get a foot in the door as they are industries that are pretty reliant (for better or worse) on personal connections. Much of the media insdustry (advertising and production) is overwhelmingly white, which always seemed strange to me in a city like London. 

PoC and people from Low-income backgrounds need support in these specific industries because its essential they are part of any conversation of image making in the UK. This is why unpaid internships need to go, because they discriminate against those who cant afford not to work.

You need to re-evaluate your views on the media industry. No one expects to be famous or rich, they expect to be paid fairly.

This was definitely an improvement on some previous away performances this season and I suspect that Harry has his eye on the next two home games, which are absolutely crucial. I doubt he'd have started Zamora on the bench otherwise - having Vargas on his own up front to hold up the ball for supporting wingers doesn't make much sense. Now isn't the best time to make an evaluation of our current form - we're at the beginning of a crucial run of fixtures. Let's take another look at the early/mid January - if we're sacrificing away points but not picking them up in the crucial home games, we've got a big problem; but if we beat West Brom and Palace at home, we can then go into the Swansea home fixture with confidence. Then it's Burnley away...

It's certainly a worry that we don't seem able to set up defensively, and I  don't expect anything from the game against Arsenal. We'll probably line up with an experimental, attacking formation, and lose 3-0. But Redknapp will be gambling on getting points from all the games around it, so let's judge ourselves on that basis.

One footnote - inevitably gossip will now turn to the transfer window. Amongst all the nonsense, what's clear is that we could do with a forward who can play alone up top.

I mean, I didn't actively not invite her. It wasn't like I purposely set out to not do so. She was just one of those socially awkward weird kids that well.. This makes me feel awful for saying it, but she was just kinda forgettable until someone mentioned her and you're like oh yeah, that weird girl. She actually lived down the road from me and was on my bus route, so it didn't help her weird reputation when every time her and her sister got on the bus, the entire bus smelled like a litter box. Not to mention the 40 some odd cats that everyone saw roaming around their house every day. 

My mom made me invite her. In fact, she put me in the car and drove me down to her house to invite her in person. I *really* really didn't want to, but once I got there and saw how surprised and shy she was, I felt bad and ended up having to talk her into coming. I remember going out of my way to make sure she had a good time and that the other girls were nice to her. 

I'd like to say that we had a lasting friendship after that but, we didn't. We didn't talk or hang out in school. Over the years though, I did take up for her when people made fun of her. I even once intervened when this particularly assholish guy had cornered her after class one day. I tried to talk to her but.. I dunno. A real friendship never really took root. I never really put much thought into her, though, or trying to kindle a real friendship because to be completely honest, I had my own childhood demons I was battling (molestation, parents constantly fighting, etc). 

Looking back on it now that I'm grown, I don't really think she was weird. I just think she was painfully shy, not too bright, and had a father that passed when she was far too young and a mother that I'm fairly certain had some mental health issues. 

She's on my Facebook now and, while she's still not too bright, she doesn't seem as shy. She's incredibly kind and nice. We talk sometimes. She's been battling breast cancer for the past six months and I've been keeping up with her progress.

Baines is a great player with a hell of a lot of ability, but the cold hard fact is that we are not a team that scores from crosses any more. Baines made 224 crosses last season, way more than any other defender in the league- yet he only completed 40 of them. Despite all this crossing ability, and the amount we throw in, we only scored 6 goals with headers all season.

Take for example Nasri, who took 204 and completed 60- not because his crossing ability is much better, but because they have someone like Dzeko in the box who is brilliant in the air. Dzeko alone got 4 headed goals...

Mirallas reflects the way we play better than most. He gets into the box, and when Baines is on form, he follows him in. Baines has had a fair few chances where he has provided both space, and a passing outlet for Mirallas just in, or on the outside of the box. I feel this is the way that the gaffer wants the team to progress, and for me it is very smart- at least until Lukaku learns how to get his giant head on the end of crosses. 

The problem in the last few games, for me at least has been the lack of the McCarthy/ Barry combo- not the fact Mirallas is there instead of Pienaar. These two combine amazingly to cover the flanks when our full backs are up the park. You can see that Coleman has needed to be more defensive minded because of this also, so it is not a problem only effecting Baines.

Good.

YES!

YEES! I'd happily commute on an electric bike, if there was one that could do short hops on the motorway and was affordable.

Don't just stick your head in the sand and hope that it all works out ok. Can you define what an English matter is? Is it anything devolved to the Scottish Parliament, Stormont or the Welsh Assembly? How do budgets work in that case? I suspect that there will be very few English only matters because anything with a budget cannot have Scottish, Welsh or Northern Irish MPs shut out.

Let's try to make whatever one is in power actually do something useful and not offer them blind support while they walk the country towards a political disaster.

Scotland has benefited massively from devolution because we now have representatives who care about the massive issues that are particular to Scotland.

It's all well and good saying we are armchair managers, but the results speak for themselves.

When Ferguson lost Ronaldo, he made the next seasons team more defensive, and came within one point of title. He understood that that the way the team played had to be altered due to the loss of Ronaldo. Rodgers need to do the same after the loss of Suarez. Suarez occupied defenders giving Sterling and Sturridge space to run into and players like Coutinho and Gerrard to pick passes out to them. He would pressure the back 4 when the had the ball, giving the rest of the team time to organise themselves. No Suarez means the counter attacking system doesn't work, as once we have tried to attack, we don't have enough time to reorganise ourselves, time Suarez would have gotten us with his pressure on the defence. 

When Guardiola left for Bayern, he could impose his possession style on them, since the players were so good, they could adapt to it. Unfortunately now, with the emphasis on buying youth and 'potential' in the summer, the players are not good enough yet to adapt to Rodgers counter attacking system in such a short time.

It's unfortunate for Rodgers as he has seen his system work, and just wants to get back to it ASAP, but rather than forcing onto the new players, he needs to ease them into it, which will take time. Funny that when he went to basics and the results came in with bringing in Lucas and playing Gerrard up front, I thought he has seen the error of his ways and was trying to build stability, but then changing the system that was working against United, I knew the game was lost as soon as the line up was announced.

Further comments about a CBT review include ""could be more emphasis on attitudinal training and perhaps more emphasis on cornering""  
Alongside separate manual/automatic CBT certificates, they would advocate a simple upgrade for those wishing to go automatic to manual. As they state "" there would be no need for the ‘upgrade’ to train the rider how to fasten a helmet again.""  
Repeat CBTs would include 'enhanced and additional skills', so as to have the rider improve, rather than just be at base CBT level.

I'm glad to see that they pour indirect scorn on the A1 licence, as it promotes unsafe riding standards in those from 17-19 ""However, it remains a high priority for industry and police that all novice riders seek to improve skills and take their test. It is unfortunate that the EU Licence Directive works against this key principle for the 17 - 19 year age group""

They have a child, and the foreign spouse is already in the country. Yet they still refused him. If that is the case, then we have no chance of appealing to them on any sort of compassionate grounds. 

These rules are just cruel, plain and simple. They have the potential to massively impact my life, and the life of my partner.

And what is the purpose? A cynical way of attempting to reduce the overall immigration numbers? But the number affected by this is relatively small compared to total immigration, and it also causes direct harm to the British citizens involved.

As for not letting in people who would have to claim benefits, all of the recipients of such visas are not eligible to claim benefits anyway! So that makes no sense!

The previous rule was that you had to prove an income equivalent to the amount that you would get on income support as a couple, after the payment of rent and council tax. So that would be currently about £110 per week, assuming that your accommodation costs are already covered. The contrast between the new rules and the old rules is huge. 

Also - it isn't just the increased income threshold that is the problem. The amount of evidence required, and thus the amount of time apart required to meet the requirements is very large. For example, a Brit who married abroad, and was living abroad, and then wants to return to the UK with their family. They either have to have a job offer that meets the financial requirements before they move here, or if they need to move here to find a job (which most people would), they then need to provide six months payslips as evidence of employment before the visa can even be applied for. So, six months worth of evidence, then the application processing time, you are looking at 7 months minimum. The foreign born spouse may well not be able to even get a visit visa in that time because they would be seen as a potential over-stayer! 

These rules just cause so much unnecessary pain and suffering. I can't fathom how anyone could come up with them, the mentality required, I just don't understand.

false,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"You right, the pledge itself was a pledge to vote against tuition fee increases and over half of Lib Dem MPs voted in favour of increases. However when in coalition it's not possible for either party to keep 100% of their promises because you can't introduce 2 opposing policies. One policy must win out and in the coalition's case the party that won out was the party with the most support among the public, the Tories. They had control of the education department and the treasury and had the power to set policy for those departments under the coalition agreement so we're tasked with university funding policy. You can certainly argue that the Lib Dems should have attempted to negotiate for control of the education department but once the coalition agreement was signed by both parties they were bound to abide by that agreement or the coalition would have collapsed within a year of beginning. People like to be flippant and say that would be a good thing but being politically unstable during a financial crisis is not fun: British citizens would have borne the brunt of the economic harm caused if the coalition collapsed. 

An allegory would be if I agreed to pay off my debt to you but the next day a debt collector came and told me I had to pay money I owed him or he'd beat me up. Maybe I am a bad friend for opting to pay the debt collector and not my friend but it's not like I was terribly happy about it. I technically had a choice but both were very shitty options. The Lib Dems had a choice: risk a decrease in popularity or risk harm to the economy because no coalition agreement can be signed. You can criticise but it's not the hideous betrayal it's been portrayed as for the last 4 years. 

It was possibly poor politics as a hung parliament was likely but as in every coalition promises must broken, it's an essential part of joint government and it makes very little sense to punish parties for cooperating and rewarding them for stalling and infighting like the US congress does. The answer is not to discourage parties from making promises or make them too scared to risk any commitment to change. You end up with more status quo that way.

So if a heroin addict wants to shootup that is fine, but their kids will be taken into social services. Likewise if a heroin addict wants to come clean, the government should facilitate programs that endeavour to accomplish this.

All drugs should be available to adults (age limit 18? 21?) but only in small quantities that are only provided once a day.

I thought the comparisons between Rodgers and David Brent were apt, but I felt it was reasonable to give him a try. He has that 'man of the people' vibe that goes down well in Liverpool (or he did before he got the teeth, the suntan and the new blonde).

During Rodgers's first two seasons: Every transfer window has left me furious, with players coming in that he just hasn't used properly (plus the usual new manager mistakes of players he has worked with before but who he doesn't realise aren't good enough for the new club - same as Moyes signing Fellaini). However, performances on the field convinced me that he was a brilliant coach for an attacking team that just needed to bring in a defensive coach as assitant to complete the package. Ignore the nonsense that comes out of his mouth, just look at the results.

During Rodgers's third season: Christ, I was wrong. It was all Suarez, wasn't it? This guy doesn't know what he's doing.

The only thing I can currently say in Rodgers's defence is that we don't know whether our continuing slow motion train wreck in the transfer market is entirely his fault, or whether that has been taken out of his hands and is the fault of somebody else.

The only feasible way to get in for most people nowadays is Tier 2 where you already have a confirmed job in a skilled occupation from a sponsoring company.

Now, if we're talking about EEA immigrants, the anti-migration lobby does have a few points, mainly regarding benefits. Unfortunately for them, we can't cherry-pick EEA migrants as that completely defeats the purpose of the EEA. However, we're completely within our rights to refuse benefits to migrants who haven't worked here enough, or alternatively to send the bill for their benefits to their home country. These are all measures that are already at our disposal, so I really don't see where the problem with migration and benefits lies.

false,captf,Scotland,YBR,"&gt; Bike licenses are too easy and quick to get. There should be more indepth and advanced training involved. This should also include motorway training and a focus on inner-city riding.

It's possible to get a car license in as little time. There are many places that do guaranteed pass courses, that can last as little as a day.

&gt; A CBT should require a theory test and more than a paltry 6 hours of training.

I'm half and half on this.  
Bringing it back with cars, you get your licence and get in a car [supervised], with no requirement of theory knowledge.  
Imposing harder restrictions on a bike will prevent people from getting one in the first place, which is the opposite of what we want.  
I wonder if a pseudo 2-tiered CBT could exist? That is, if you've not sat - and passed - your theory test, you must be accompanied at all times by another rider [not car, but bike]. Once you have passed it, then you can go it alone. Could be signified by different coloured L plates?

&gt; Similar restrictions to bike riders and engine power for car drives

Whole-hearted agreement.

&gt; Have police crack-down on bad driving.

I think this should include people unable to drive to the conditions of the road.  
Going 30 mph on a 60mph road? Screw you, 3 points! These people cause accidents, as other drivers get frustrated, angry and impatient.

&gt; All potential license holders should be required to pass a CBT and have 500 miles of road experience. This includes cyclists.

How do you enforce it? 500 miles can also be done in a day and be of less benefit compared to doing, for instance, 250 miles over the course of a month.  
I do get what you mean though: prevent people getting their provisional licence, and then passing a test within a week and being out on the road. Zero experience, and potentially dangerous.  
Passing your test should involve having driven/ridden in various weather conditions.

&gt; Separate van license.

Nice in theory. Could perhaps be a graduated licence. [Sort of is already. Cars are category B, vans are B1], where you need a separate licence for the full-sized transits. The car-based vans would be as part of the standard cat B.

&gt;Eriksen has scored vs Swansea and Hull in this role

Who is to say he wouldn't be better in his preferred central role? A broken clock is still right twice a day. The author also uses Lennon on the right as an example of inverted wingers working, but Lennon is not inverted when on the right and if Eriksen was in the middle the players would still be in close proximity. In fact, I could just as easily counter the two Eriksen goals by pointing out Lennon got two important assists (vs Everton for Soldado and vs Hull for Eriksen) whilst on the right.

I think Chadli scoring 6 from the left (as a right footed player) would have better made his point.

&gt;It's very rare for a goal to come from a cross

But that isn't the only thing a natural winger offers. Width stretches the back line and gives the creative/striking players more room to move. Running to the byline and cutting back produces goals too, it is not just crossing. 

&gt;Tellingly, he receives the ball from the left flank – the very position a traditional winger would have occupied

He receives the ball in the box...

&gt;width is supplied by full-backs, who play much further up the pitch than they used to.

You can still have advanced fullbacks and natural wingers, combining to overload the opposing fullback.  A natural winger can still move in if the fullback presses up, 


&gt;Another myth is that by cutting inside they will get in the way of the other attacking players in a congested central zone

This isn't true. The problem is that with your wide men cutting in you play very narrow and are easy to defend against. Hull defended spurs last year by simply congesting the middle of the park.

Don't forget, these things often go wrong for reasons other than malice e.g. her parents pass away and you are left footing the bill, economy crashes.

Bottom line is, banks don't care about the background of guarantees (subject to fraud, coercion), they simply want their money back and it is irrelevant if its unfair that you'll be made to pay.

A person failing to wear a seatbelt in the back of a car can directly injure people in front of them, since they can be launched forward. The same could theoretically apply to those in the front being catapulted forwards and out of the car, although I'm not sure I could find a case of that to prove it. Moreover, a very large percentage of cars are driven by people with kids, and failing to make your kids wear a seatbelt is clearly a kind of negligence on the part of the parents. Protecting the safety of children, who need to be told what to do to stay safe, makes perfect sense. Mandating that all cars have seatbelts and that all people wear 'em ensures that you don't have situations where a family has a kid but can't afford to change to a car with seatbelts or whatever else.

This is getting kind of convoluted so I'll cut it short. Requiring seat belts protects more than just the person who wants not to wear one; requiring a bike jacket/gloves/trousers does not protect anyone else.

Psychology is most certainly a soft science. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_science a conclusion I reached by reading. 

I am arguing that the practitioners of psychology and its proponents have been over stating its value in any number of fields for a long time, at its best it can make statistical predictions for the probability of a given outcome for any individual within a numerically significant group at its worst it is pseudo science and all too often we hear hard predictions from psychology about an individual which is something that the science just is not built to establish. 

The issue here is the weight a psychologists opinion is given in such considerations is equivalent to that of a medical diagnosis and that is simply not acceptable. 

People have had careers halted or been passed over for opportunities for decades now because hired gun psychologists used the Myers Briggs tests something which is only now being addressed as bunk by the mainstream. 

If this field wants real lasting credibility then its practitioners need to learn the limit of what their own science enables them to predict and individual cases is outside of that realm.

I wasn't overly happy with appointing him, but he looked an interesting choice. He looked like a coach that has good ideas. I'm more than willing to give him time.

Last year changes nothing but people cannot understand it for some reason. This was one off. He and the team is still in transition. We had nowhere near good enough squad last year to challenge for the title. As it happened some rivals stumbled and our key players remained injury free for the most of the campaign (and we had hardly any distractions from cup comps - no europe and fell out of domestic cups quickly). If we had lost Suarez and Sturridge at some point last year then we would've been even more fucked than this year. Sterling started performing at the end of the season. We had no cover. 

If you die inside when you listen to post-match interviews, then you shouldn't watch them, they aren't any indication of how Rodgers really thinks, that should be clear already. He is much better at communicating to the media than Hodgson and Dalglish were at bad times. He just tries to give them as little as possible.

We were much worse under Dalglish's full season. That squad was as midtable as it could've been. The potential of that squad was much lower than the current squad has. 

We're in much better situation than we were before Rodgers took over. You have to be able to distinguish between poor performances from a poor squad and poor performances of a better squad that's underperforming at the moment - you can see the low confidence. That will change with hard work. New players need time to adapt. Moreno, Can and Markovic have huge potential but they need to sort their feet out and work hard. Markovic has shown some glimpses of the quality he possesses, Can looks strong and powerful midfielder and Moreno looks sharp going forward. At the same time they still don't look comfortable in the team. They are not wasted money.

And don't talk about AVB, he's had two jobs in England and has failed at both. Has had relatively good backing as well. Until he works himself up again he should not be considered. He always looks completely out of ideas when things aren't going well. At least Brendan is trying different things. 

Getting a player to score goals will be huge for this team. Goals give the team confidence and get other players rolling. I lost count last year when the team looked average until we got a goal. If we don't have a goalscorer the opposition will be more confident of shutting up the shop and getting something out of the game. Sterling isn't a goalscorer, yet. So, it has to be Sturridge if Balotelli doesn't get himself going.

Moreno was also very lazy getting back but there should have been enough cover anyway.

Such bullshit, no ones advocating building a mile high wall around the UK, this country already has immigration controls, modifying them slightly isnt going to cost a significant amount of money.  Its also important to mention that the UK has paid £230bn more into the EU then it has received, im sure itll cost less then 1% of that to slightly change the criteria for a workers visa.

&gt;actually reduce growth. 

How?

&gt;We could, instead, find measures such as increasing taxation, creating a basic guaranteed income for citizens as well as improving workers rights and increasing pay.

You yourself admitted that wage depression exists, but decided to hand wave it away by saying there are other factors, by why exacerbate it?

You then said immigrants pay into pension funds are fund the welfare state, which is totally wrong as they have been a net loss of ~£100b in the last 20 or so years and even if you use the cherry picked value of £5bn added by new EU immigrants, Gov spending from 2004-2011 was £4600bn, losing 0.1% of this isnt going to ""Destroy the welfare state as we know it"", and when you factor in wage depression, housing etc we arent losing out by reducing numbers.

&gt;We could, instead, find measures such as increasing taxation, creating a basic guaranteed income for citizens as well as improving workers rights and increasing pay. 

This is where things get silly and you essentially start contradicting yourself. You say immigrants pay for pensions, but then go on to say they have negative costs which should be made up for by increasing taxes, well then why not increase taxes in the first place to pay for pensions instead of going through your convoluted route? You also havent justified why thinking increasing tax rates will increase tax revenue.

I am also very aware that a lot of this comes from growing up protestant/unionist, and that I would have had a different experience if I had grown up with a catholic/nationalist background, but I didn't claim to speak for everyone.

Things like accent and language differences, while small, are noticeable. The Irish language as well, which is pervasive down south, and most people have some knowledge, is entirely unfamiliar to me. Sport is different, as I grew up with absolutely no experiences of GAA, playing rugby and football instead. Different education systems, different politics, different currency, different road signs even. Small things, but it makes a place feel different. I am fairly familiar with most places in Northern Ireland, I'd go on school trips to Fermanagh or Omagh, but not to places down south. TV is different: any RTÉ we could get would be very bad quality so we wouldn't watch it. Experiences of the Troubles and conflict contribute as well to a separate 'Northern Irish' experience I think. I guess to an extent as well I was taught to think that Northern Irishness is different to Irishness, both consciously and unconsciously. In school we did a bit of Irish history, from the famine to partition, and it was made clear the differences between the north and the rest of Ireland, both religious and economic: the industrial north compared to the agricultural south, with emphasis on the shipbuilding, linen, and tobacco industries. Most of the rest of the history we did, pre-GCSE anyway, was British history, with the odd focus on Northern Ireland. These sorts of things add up.

In terms of feeling Irish, well, to anyone not from the island of Ireland there is no distinction between Irish and Northern Irish, so I've just accepted that to everyone else in the world I'm just Irish. Which I don't mind, although I would still instinctively introduce myself as Northern Irish.

false,MidnightToSix,lfcflame,,"Maybe not all that obscure, but the 2004/05 Champions League winning season will never be eclipsed for me.  Your random musings have encouraged me to remember some of the best parts of that season.

2004/05 was the first season that I had a decent understanding of football.  I had started properly following Liverpool a year or so before that (around the age of 8), but not as religiously as I would from that season forward.

I doubt any European campaign from any team has ever had as many incredible and special moments as ours.  It almost seemed surreal at times.  I don't think winning our first Premier League title would even top it.  

It all started for me in Greece.  I was on holiday with my parents in August, right about the time we were playing Graz AK in the qualifying round.  I remember watching the game in a bar, pint of coke in hand.  Gerrard's two goals that night were two of the finest strikes of a football I could remember seeing at that point.  The way he so effortlessly swung his foot at the ball was incredible to me.  I left the bar that night thinking we had the tie won.  Little did I know we would go on to lose 1-0 at Anfield and just about make it through to the groups.

Back in the UK and I can remember the huge buildup to that first group game against Monaco.  Cisse scoring our first of two and the commentator saying something along the lines of ""European football is back at Anfield, and Liverpool are off and running in their campaign"".  The next few group games were rather uneventful, although I remember thinking that Saviola was a complete fuck when they beat us 1-0 in Monaco.

Then came the first defining game of that season against Olympiakos.  I missed the first half hour or so because I was at some school event that evening.  I came home to find we were a goal down (remember this was before every 10 year old had a smartphone).  Obviously needing to win by two goals, I remember watching the remainder of that half with my dad feeling rather dejected.  Some hope was regained when Sinama Pongolle scored shortly after half time, but as the half wore on it looked increasingly less likely that we were going to do it.  Nerves obviously got the best of my dad as he went outside for a smoke near the end of the game.  About a minute later Mellor scored our second goal as I ran frantically for the door to alert him.  The next 5 minutes were spent nervously bouncing around the living room as we looked for the crucial third goal.  The infamous ""lovely cushioned header..."" line and the next thing I knew I was back on the sofa with my dad on top of me as pandemonium broke out in the household.  Other than the final itself - that night was probably the best for me as a Liverpool fan.

Another rather uneventful tie against Leverkusen as we ran out comfortable 6-2 winners on aggregate.  I remember Scott Carson making a blooper at the end of the first game at Anfield to give us at least some concerns going into the second leg.  Then came Juventus - footballing giants at the time and the first time we had played them since Heysel.  I remember Rush and Platini coming out before the game with the plaque.  Hyypia popping up with the unlikely volley.  Then Garcia with one of the best goals I have ever seen.  Our whole campaign consisted of average to decent players performing out of their skin which is something that made it even more special for me.

A few days after the 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge in the semi final, I was at Anfield for the Middlesbrough game where Gerrard scored [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXkU1QDB8AQ) ridiculous goal.

A few day later it was back to Anfield for the second leg.  Who could ever forget the noise our fans made before, during, and after that game?  The goal that probably shouldn't have been from Garcia, then we somehow managed to keep a clean sheet.  The great chance that Gudjohnsen smashed wide right near the end sticks out in my memory.  Then Riise striping in front of the kop and tossing his entire kit to the fans.  Sticking it to Mourinho as Rafa said that the Liverpool fans were the real special ones.

Then the final itself.  Nothing much more needs to be said about that, other than it was the greatest comeback in European Cup history.  When Alonso scored the equalizing penalty I remember the commentator exclaiming ""this is unreal!"" in a somewhat croaky voice.  Goosebumps everytime.  The double save from Dudek.  Carragher's last ditch tackles.  His frantically telling Dudek to do the Grobbelaar.  Smicer kissing the badge.  ""The weight of the world on his shoulders"".  Dudek's save - the run and jump as the players smothered him.  You'll Never Walk Alone playing over the PA as Gerrard carried Old Big Ears off into the Istanbul night.  Ours to keep.  ""How can I leave after a night like this?"".  Rafa's ridiculous calmness during the interviews.  Gerrard taking the trophy to bed with him.  

10 year old me had school the next morning and I still stayed up until about 3am celebrating that night.  I think I went to bed with my Liverpool shirt on.

Oh, how I miss those times.

&gt;A __Privilege day__ in the United Kingdom is a day of [annual leave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_leave) granted to employees of the [Civil Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty%27s_Civil_Service). These are in addition to [bank holidays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holiday), but do still count as ""working days"" for the purpose of [freedom of information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information) requests. 

&gt;There are 2.5 privilege days each year:   

&gt;


&gt;* __[The Queen's Official Birthday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Official_Birthday)__. This is a full day usually attached to the Spring Bank Holiday, the last Monday in May, on either the Friday before the Bank Holiday or the Tuesday after (in order to create a long weekend). 

&gt;* __[Maundy Thursday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maundy_Thursday)__. This is a half day on the afternoon of the Thursday of [Holy Week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Week). 

&gt;* __[Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas)__. This is an extra full day of leave at Christmas, originally allocated in respect of the Queen's Official Birthday, in addition to the bank holidays of [Christmas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas) and [Boxing Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_Day). It is often arranged so as to connect the Christmas bank holidays to an adjacent weekend.

Sterling definitely needs a break, so Markovic in for him in that second striker role. Whilst Bournemouth are a good footballing side I think it's worth seeing if the game is a physical one before playing Lallana and his iffy ribs.

false,PyschoCandy,null,null,"&gt; Your solutions to low wages, housing and public services all require more money? Where's that supposed to come from?

For Wages we are already subsidizing these companies with welfare.  The money for wages comes from the businesses paying the wages.  The reduction in welfare and increase in taxes makes this an easy boost to our economy.

In housing it would be cheaper for state to build council/social housing.  Currently we are paying a premium to private landlords.  Then following through the people in cheaper houses would have more money to spend, again helping the economy.   

To answer your question generally, we should be getting more money from Corporations and the top 10% income earners.  Both are enjoying records 'profits' and an additional tax is only fair.

They are a scapegoat as they are not the problem.  It's pretty self-explanatory.  

£1 a week is only for the poor (there is no effect for mid/high earners) and this is negligible (even to them).  When you consider the total addition to our economy/GDP EU immigration brings it is clear they are helping.

The debate was primarily the economy actually, until it was proven to be a false narrative.  Integration of communities is simple xenophobia, or at worst racism (proven by high immigration areas not having issues with immigration).  The other items (housing, GP, transport) are indeed issues, issues that that need to be addressed.  No party on the right is looking to fix or even help these issues.  Even if UKIP won they aren't throwing out the people already here, so people should consider voting for a party that has real plans for housing/GP/Transport.",0,1418739530,null,0,false,0,cmwjcfz,t3_2pgdnd,t1_cmwjcfz,t1_cmwhcnk,null,1425372914,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Kane is technically in the #10 role, but he always moves forward or moving back to press defenders on the ball. Lamela's defensive inefficiencies have been exposed over and over again. Eriksen has made more successful tackles.

However, imagine him making those tackles in the final third, stopping the opposition before they can even piece together an attack. Further more, imagine him not having to track back because we technically have 2 strikers froward.

So if he's most productive when he moves in the middle - which he does every game - has been very successful in tackles, then it makes sense to move him to the center. The idea that ""Eriksen moved back to the left"" is a bit of nonsense that goes against the evidence of his time at Ajax and with the Danish National team.

Removal of welfare locks us in the class system whereby people grow up in poverty remain in poverty for the rest of their lives as they don't have access to the resources they need to become successful.

EDIT: It can be thought of as a long-term investment - greater social mobility means greater growth in the long term as you have more people with the means to buy, produce and sell. Of course it's not a perfect model as uncontrolled spending causes figures to inflate in a way that social mobility becomes unmanageable (and is why I disagree with the premise of the article that we should ignore the deficit), but neither is the model of suggesting that if we make everyone's lives shit now by removing every support mechanism, we are in a better position moving forward.

EDIT2: Whilst I'm clearly biased towards the first model for financial growth, I feel its worth stating that both models are huge gambles.  For every person who goes to college and becomes successful, you have another person who goes and becomes a dropout, pouring money down the drain.  And with the other model, for every person who gets confined into poverty by restrictive cuts, there is another person whose hardship causes them to strive further than they otherwise would.  The reality is no-one actually knows what the best course of action is, because economic micromanagement of a country is a genuinely hard problem. Whilst I have harsh words against the Tories because their cuts affect the people I know, I accept that they are doing what they think is the correct thing to do, and I can't honestly say whether they are wrong. All I know is I wish people's lives weren't being fucked over by the system. The problem with politics is that all the complexities of the problem are lost in the communication between the government and the people.",0,1418740020,null,0,1418742689,0,cmwjjb5,t3_2pgc89,t1_cmwjjb5,t1_cmwhf14,null,1425372825,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Lovren was a beast at Lyon and Southampton, Balo became a much better footballer at AC Milan, and Lallana didnt get a pre-season.

Regarding transfers particularly, I think the only bad signings he made were Mignolet and Aspas. Mignolet and Aspas were never liverpool quality players. 

However, I respect the fact that he seems to have a plan for the future with all these young signings and refusal to sign big name players. In that regard we seem to have a similar transfer policy to dortmund.

His actual answer is... I don't know... it's just too passive aggressive. It sort of says ""well... we're stuck with him for now, so the best I can do is to try to get the most out of him... which doesn't seem like much, at the moment... But hopefully he won't be here forever"".

Secondly you have to meet certain criteria to be able to drive. Some can't drive because they have epilepsy, some can't drive because they are blind.

Many people who enter the UK can not drive on the license of their nation of origin.

The welfare issue. We basically have this massive pension bill that is not being touched and other areas are starting to get cut, policing, the NHS, etc. Farage is overblowing a tiny sliver of this pie and putting the blame upon it.  

We need to raise taxes upon corporations or those that benefit significantly from corporations, this enables us to correctly increase our welfare spending and government spending to ease the stress that immigration puts upon our services.

&gt; Such bullshit, no ones advocating building a mile high wall around the UK, this country already has immigration controls, modifying them slightly isnt going to cost a significant amount of money. 

Yes, it really is. If the political will is focused on anti-immigration policies there will never be enough security. Furthermore, what does ""modifying them slightly"" even entail? - nobody gives a clear answer because its a fucking massive job. At the same time, though, we'd want to maintain trade with Europe but require business visas? No visas but some how stop migration? The number of border checks would increase massively. Fake documents, dealing with errors, having immigrants report to police stations; this all requires personnel and costs a shit load of cash because you have to have appeals systems, decent legal defences and so much more.

&gt; the UK has paid £230bn more into the EU then it has received

This is one of those bullshit figures banged around by privately owned news groups with an agenda that does not match yours or ours.
Even if it wasn't the result of a harmonous market place is worth far more than £230 billion to our capitalists.

Your objective should be to work as little for as much pay as possible, where the objective of business owners (like the Barclay brothers that own the telegraph,  the Murdoch's or Richard Desmond) is to get you to work as much as possible paying you as little as possible. You need to be extremely sceptical when trusting anything they say on immigration because their interests will never ever be in line with yours.

&gt; You yourself admitted that wage depression exists, but decided to hand wave it away by saying there are other factors, by why exacerbate it?

The objective of a capitalist is to generate as much profit as humanly possible. Labour is the largest factor involved in the process; the result is that every capitalist wants labour to be cheaper. Immigration increases competition for employees but it is actually a relatively minor facto when compared with automation, the hollowing out of industries, exporting jobs abroad.
In fact, immigration is actually rather redundant because you're talking about a subset of the population with reduced language skills making many jobs out of reach (e.g. those that require significant communication skills).

&gt; This is where things get silly and you essentially start contradicting yourself. You say immigrants pay for pensions, but then go on to say they have negative costs which should be made up for by increasing taxes.

I didn't say ""negative costs"" I said strain on public services which is not the same thing; they bring in money but tax cuts in other areas, austerity measures and other spending plans. If we cut immigration we'd produce a lot less.

We have an ageing population that requires pensions. If you take away immigration then our economy would look fucking bleak. This will cause further emigration from our working age population, why should I work to pay for the pensions when I'll probably get sweet fuck all?

As for workers rights and improved welfare systems that I mentioned I don't have easy answers for you because its a hard problem. In fact, the ease of the solution ""cap migrants and leave the EU"" should have alarm bells ringing because its beyond a fucking joke to think its that simple (unless you want to work until your 75 with no rights and no pension after you physically can't work any more, that is).",0,1418741859,null,0,false,0,cmwkasu,t3_2pgdnd,t1_cmwkasu,t1_cmwix3y,null,1425372468,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

We know the Twelfth Doctor vaguely recognizes his new face but can't place it or understand why he got it. As viewers, however, we recognize it as the face of both Caecilius from The Fires of Pompeii and Frobisher from Torchwood: CoE.

Despite his Time Lord instincts telling him that the man was fated to die, the Tenth Doctor allowed Donna to talk him into saving Caecilius and his family. As a direct result, Caecilius had descendants that he would not have had before.

One of those descendants was John Frobisher, who went on to play a pivotal role in events which deeply hurt a close friend of the Doctor's-- Jack Harkness. Because the Doctor had already irretrievably tangled the time lines around Frobisher, he was unable to intervene against the 456 without tearing reality (a situation nearly identical to the one surrounding Amy and Rory being trapped in Manhattan).

The Doctor now wears Caecilius' face as a reminder to himself of the unforeseen consequences of interfering with time.

If you borrow £100 at 3% and invest that in something that will create more than that in added value for future generations (better schools, better hospitals, safer streets, better infrastructure etc etc) you are helping them get better jobs and have a better life, you are creating a better society. With the better education they will be able to compete in the world for better jobs and high salaries and then be able to pay more taxes back to the state to more easily pay off the debt, it is a virtuous cycle.  If you don't do this you are doing something immoral to the future generations by not investing, you are depriving future generations of good services, good education etc etc. And making it harder to pay off the debt in the long term. Borrowing is good if you are investing in something that is of a greater potential value than the cost of the loan.

Alternatively you could cut back on state investment in education and burden students with massive loans which they won't pay back in their whole life time. The individual loan will have higher repayments than the state borrowing so this IS taking money from the future and burdening the future (young people) with debt. 

This is what the Tories want, a small state so the rich don't have to pay as much tax and then the lower orders burdened with massive debt as debt repayments from the poor burdened with debt go to the people with the money - the rich.

However, although not all tottenham supporters are jewish, in a show of solidarity we took the word and repurposed it ourselves. In the old Spartacus movie, when the romans came looking for spartacus, everyone he had helped stood up and to protect and support him they each claimed ""I am Spartacus"". Think of it like that, and although sometimes other supporters chant about hitler and Auschwitz (Arsenal fans last year) or make gas chamber hisses (Chelsea and west ham) we continue to call ourselves yids not because of, but in spite of this. Some people may say tottenham should get rid of it, but to target tottenham fans for chanting it (which occasionally happens) and not other supporters for chanting explicitly anti-semetic things is more or less victim blaming. When a player does well we chant ""Yiddo"" at them, or, things like that, and be prepared for Deandre Yedlin to be called ""Yidlin"" a lot. No one here will ever mean it in a derogatory manner, and if any chelsea or arsenal or wet spam (west ham) fans try to use it, fuck em. They aint got shit on us, weve got a damn army.

Deliberately mismanaging a player to prove a point to the board is hardly a mature and (especially in our current situation) productive way to go about things 
* The effect of both of the above is unlikely to help squad morale - will all purchases start wondering now whether they're in Rodgers' black book?

Johnson has been very poor this season i'll give you that. but you seem to forget the impact he had and how much he affected last season's run for glory. Johnson is an offensive outlet and an experienced player. it is also fairly obvious that the problems only arise when both full backs are pushed up too high. the whole idea of our system is the have a back 4 at all times...that means when johnson pushes up, skrtel slides right, stevie or lucas drop back, lovren/sahko/toure slide right and moreno/enrique slide right. this is to mitigate a diagonal ball or someone bombing down the wing. the problem i have been noticing is we do not slide fast enough, and when one fb pushes up, the other generally gets stuck watching the ball too much. i mean it's crazy when johnson has the ball, and loses it, that the person tracking a runner is raheem from 30 yards back. now with that said, that's systemic and a stylistic change that needs to be recognized by full backs. but johnson has been relatively decent in his performances. in addition, i really don't think our best option is playing manquillo week in, week out...not yet at least. flanno really, truly, is our most balanced fb in the squad. he defends well (and tackles hard for that matter) and he has shown the propensity to attack when required and the time is right. so when he comes back, he is our starting rb. but johnson will be gone this year (as he probably should, i think he's worn out his lfc stay) but to say johnson is woeful is a shame. johnson was one of the best fbs for the better part of the last 5 years. that is a disservice to the man and i think rodgers is absolutely right when he says that he is the type of player you only really miss when he's gone. i think johnson leaving creates a void in our squad that needs to be filled by flanno, wisdom, or manquillo, and if it isn't filled by them, then next summer we need to dip our toes once more into the market.",0,1418743357,null,0,false,0,cmwkyrq,t3_2pevlp,t1_cmwkyrq,t1_cmwcnew,null,1425372158,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1
