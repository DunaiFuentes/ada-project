Supporting a smaller team is hard, but the highs are incomparable, and the lows are never quite as low (even if they are more often). We have gone through the ringer as a supporter group, from the top to nearly rock bottom- but it has only made the support stronger. That is why I have a lot of love for the City lads, I know a lot of hardcore fans who were season ticket holders when Vassell was their top player, and they stuck with it. Good lads, good team with good support them- whilst they have got lucky as hell, and a lot of people resent them for it, their true fanbase have been to hell and back with that club and never turned their back.

I'd expect them to treat members of other religions (and atheists!) on an equal basis, not, as Pickles seems to advocate, as second rate inferior creeds - especially given that the CofE position of political superiority as the established religion was acquired by means that modern men view with horror, and hence shouldn't entitle them to special treatment",0,1396916293,null,0,1396918188,0,cgmq6x8,t3_22d3fk,t1_cgmq6x8,t1_cgmplco,null,1433255534,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

He also points out that while shale gas may be less polluting than coal and oil, it is still a fossil fuel. ""If we have any hope of hitting our two-degree [climate change] target, burning gas is not the way.

""Diverting investment from renewables is also a genuine concern"".

""For the rest of the world then, any significant shale production within this timescale seems wholly unrealistic. ""You can forget about the next five to 10 years,"" says Prof Stevens. ""Fifteen to 20 is a possibility"".

Those governments looking to shale as a quick fix for high energy prices and security of supply may, then, have unrealistic expectations. Shale may not be the saviour that many hope it to be.""

He is saying 15-20 years and that shale gas will crowd out renewable investment. Also the contaminated waste water problem... It just does not seem viable to me given climate change.

true,TheOnlyKnownTurtoad,,We're all going on a European tour!,"Okore was linked with Chelsea and ironically chose us because he thought he'd play more football.

I think in terms of Kozak and Helenius, those were brought in for the inevitable departure of Benteke in this summer transfer window. In fact if he carried his form over and had a great start to the season, there were probably concerns he would leave in January. Obviously Benteke was hit by injury and his form hasn't fully recovered and just as it looked to be on the rise, boom he's out for six months.

Kozak looked like the sort of player we should have in our squad, he showed some good potential - but he was injured. Helenius did not, in fact the only notable thing Helenius has done so far is to have his shorts pulled down.

But it looks like we'll be staggering over the line with Holt, who put a shift in on Saturday and looked pleased to score. He played a little bit like Weimann, he ran at defenders and put a lot of effort in and got a well deserved goal - the main difference between him and Weimann, Grant Holt can find the net.

I think for the remainder of the season it would be best to utilise Gabby's pace, he can score, he's done it many a times in the past. But Holt would go well with his a sort of tap-in striker and he scored from a corner so there's that too.

I hope we don't sell him. But he's not yet at the class where we can dominate European teams with, he's still not first-choice striker material for Chelsea. We need someone who we can depend on scoring if the rest of the team fails. Drogba is a perfect example. I doubt Lukaku can handle that kind of pressure **yet**. Lukaku can do that for Everton, but our team is no Everton. 

I understand that you're mostly referring to the beginning of the season where we could pick between loaning Lukaku out and keeping him. But say we did keep Lukaku, he still would not get anywhere close to the same amount of minutes he's been getting at Everton. I don't think I'd want that for a 20yr old who needs all the playing time he can get. *Heck, Mou probably wanted a go with Torres as well to see what he can do.*

true,TheBlueOwlPlays,eng-westmidlands,Birmingham &amp; Coventry,"&gt; So, how would we call ourselves?

I doubt the name would change, the term ""Great Britain"" refers to the island that the majority of Scotland, England and Wales are on, so even if the union doesn't include all of Great Britain, we could still be called The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in a similar way that the United States of America does not cover all of the Americas, it's just a union on North America.

If the name did change, it would likely be to The United Kingdom of Britain and Northern Ireland, as the term ""Britain"" refers only to England and Wales (it comes from when we were a Roman province called Britannia). ""Great Britain"" refers to Britain and Scotland. It's a very obscure concept and I don't know if it is still official, but it makes sense if you think about it.

So, our name would likely remain unchanged or we'd simply drop the ""Great"" on an official level, the term ""Great Britain"" would still apply to the island.

&gt; What happens to the union flag? Do we keep it or get a new one

It is incredibly unlikely that the flag would change, we didn't remove St. Patricks' cross when Ireland left the union in 1922. Whilst some of the Irish Free State (Northern Ireland) chose to rejoin the union, the real reason for keeping the old flag is that it would have cost a ton of money. So should Scotland leave the union, changing the union flag would mean little more than throwing away a globally recognised brand and spending millions of pounds to do so, Scotland agrees the post-independence flag would be a decision to be made by the UK, so I really doubt it'll change.

Most of the questions you asked can't really be answered yet, as Scotland's independence will only properly by negotiated in the event of a Yes vote, the referendum is in 2014, with the proposed separation date in 2016, David Cameron has repeatedly said he doesn't want to pre-negotiate independence.

Quick (but not definitely correct at this point) answers to all of your questions are:

What would we call ourselves?: The same thing we have been, or very similar

What would we call the island?: It's a geographical term, so it would remain the same regardless of the politics on it.

Would NI unionists still feel loyal to the UK?: I see little reason why they wouldn't.

Would the overseas territories remain so?: It's very likely that they would

What happens the union flag?: It would remain the same

The the UK still be a permanent member of the UN security council?: Yes

How would things change south of the border?: It's hard to say at this point

Have we actually got a plan?: The official position of the Prime Minister is that it's too early to make one, but we'd have two years to make one should we need to.",0,1396928694,null,0,1396935564,0,cgmw6qj,t3_22f5ht,t1_cgmw6qj,t3_22f5ht,null,1433258425,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The Suarez vs villa penalty? That's the same kind of penalty Dzeko won last weekend. The other player obstructs enough to be a foul, but the striker goes down to win it. It was agreed by the media (who wouldn't miss an opportunity to condemn Suarez), to be a fair call. The only people that didn't think it was were on this website.

The only other possible one I can think of is Flanagan's on Sunday? He didn't play for the penalty in that, if you watch it, he tries to carry on winning the ball and actually seems fairly surprised at the call. 

I'm not really interested in provoking an argument, I'm just seeing a lot of accusations against my team, and I usually don't mind admitting my teams short-comings. I don't feel we've been guilty more than any other team of a few cheap calls.

Our style of play attracts penalties. Rodgers had a record amount at Swansea too, it's how aggressive we are at playing into the box. I think if anything we're lucky a lot of rash tackles by defenders have bailed us out of matches. Not so much we've gone out trying to win penalties.

For the fans, the belief in Lambert has deteriorated. For every hit signing there have been two misses, somewhat forgiven on such a budget. But his tactics are glaringly deficient.
The away form should be of no concern. Sitting 10th in the travelling table this term and eighth last, Villa are almost entertaining outside Birmingham.
They use the ball in short bursts, moving at speed and hitting hard. But no team built a good season on away form alone, just ask Manchester United.
At home is where Lambert shows himself up. The Scot shows little variation in tactics from home and away, and his side look stumped when the ball is at their feet and the onus is on building an attack rather than counter attacking.

The result is bundles of possession but no edge. Side-to-side, a phobia of the final third and a fondness for the easy option, just what the fans don't want to see.
The shoestring budget excuse cannot constantly be used to explain away this tactical incapability.
Lambert spent £6.1m on Libor Kozak in the summer, a decent yet limited forward at a time Villa were crying out for creativity. They have suffered without it.
You can can count on one hand how many times they have outplayed their visitors in the last two seasons. The backbone is there; Brad Guzan, Ron Vlaar, Fabian Delph and the powerful, if sometimes hit-and-miss, Christian Benteke. But the belief, man-management and quality of those surrounding it is not.

So, who is to blame? The budget players? An owner who is quite literally paying for previous ambition? Or a manager who has had little to work with but does even less to help himself?
Fans face this dilemma: back Lambert wholeheartedly in an age of rash sackings, or call for his head. You can ask Manchester United how that feels, too.
The owner has the same conundrum. Lambert had a three-year plan, but after almost two years of mediocrity, he has done little to suggest he will take Villa to anywhere near Europe in the coming years. On December 15, 2012, after beating Liverpool 3-1 at Anfield, he said he would.
A decent top-half finish next season may save his job. The odds are stacked against him even reaching that target.

&gt;__Cain and Abel__ ([Hebrew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language): הֶבֶל ,קַיִן *Qayin*, *Hevel*) were, according to the [Book of Genesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis), two sons of [Adam and Eve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve). Cain is described as a crop farmer and his younger brother Abel as a shepherd. Cain was the first human born and Abel was the first human to die. Cain committed the first murder by killing his brother. Exegeses of Genesis 4 by ancient and modern commentators have typically assumed that the motives were jealousy and anger.  In the [Cain and Abel story](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel_in_Islam) found in the [Quran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran), the text refers to them simply as *the sons of Adam* (Arabic: ابني آدم).

true,kopking08,null,null,"For me the easiest thing to do is to look at his mistakes his first season and see where he's learned and where he hasn't.

I think his greatest mistake his first season was his decision to force Allen into the side when his play never justified it (but for a handful of matches at the start of the season). The other mistake was when we would attempt to play with just two CMs. He did this a number of matches and we lost or couldn't control every match where we did this.

This season I think he has simply played the players who deserve to play. So be it if Aspas, Alberto, Ilori, etc haven't played or even earned a spot. 

WE'RE IN FIRST FUCKING PLACE WITH 74 POINTS FROM 33 matches. Fuckin hell you lot noting transfer incompetence.

What's he shown is fucking balls by playing the best players, even when a lot of managers would force signings into a side in attempts to justify the signing.

As for him playing just 2 CMs. He has maybe only a few times lined us up without a DM this season, whether it was Lucas or Gerrard. 

This shows immense tactical growth. He has not attempted to force some ""vision"" onto the side when he can tinker with it to get the best results.


The key area of improvement for him next season will be in substitution policy and rotation. It's been an issue he hasn't really had to deal with as we went out of the cups so early on too. With 3 cups next season, surely he's going to have to come up with a better plan to maximize the stamina of Suarez, Sturridge, and Gerrard over the course of a season. Everyone else, I feel, can more obviously suit a rotation policy.

I was (and am) all for clearing the top earners whose performances have never justified their wages. 

I was (and am) all for giving promising players from the lower leagues a chance to play football.

I am also a massive supporter of our youth system which owing to a catalogue of catastrophic failures in previous management, has churned out a fair number of excellent players who have all (barring perhaps one exception (Gabby)), either been sold or never given a chance to push on.

I am also a big believer in going out in a football match fearless and playing some football.

Lambert has carried out the mandate for the first two points I made above and he deserves credit. However, he's largely ignored our promising youth players and only introduced Albrighton after huge supporter pressure. What is worst of all is the tactical incompetence on display week in week out.

I hate what we've become. Villa's football is one of:

1. Soaking up immense amounts of pressure, stealing the ball, punting it long and getting a goal on the counter; or
2. Hoofing it to Benteke's face, hoping he can pull off a bit of magic and score that way.

We can't put together more than five passes. It's ridiculous. I love my team but if I look at it objectively, with the exception of maybe Norwich and Sunderland, our football is atrocious.

I've been saying this for years (partly because I'm from the north east, so have seen it frequently with SAFC and Newcastle) but a relegation would do Villa's footballing a world of good.

We had Talk Talk *for business* at work. It wasn't too bad actually - you could call a human being, the service was decent enough and it was all paid on invoiced account via BACS at the end of the month like any other business service is. For context, we've got a terrible internet connection to our site, so we use a load balanced system between three different providers due to frequent connection problems and slow speeds.

Then they decided to put our *business* onto a home account. Out of the blue we got a letter saying our service had changed.

They stopped sending us invoices, and for this reason, the invoices never got paid. If you don't invoice us, we don't pay you. Simple. So they cut us off. Now, if you're a business, the last thing you want your workforce to see is a message come up when they try to access the web PM system saying that the internet account has been suspended. Despite the load balancing system, as the talk-talk line was still 'working' in the eyes of the switch, it went ahead and used TT's DNS and blocked our connection regardless.

When we called them up, they told us that *we had to pay to get an invoice*, and instead to go online to look at our bill there. I say again, they had *cut us off*, and despite their automatic redirected 'account suspended' page having a link to a payment system, it returned a 404 error leaving us no way to pay them. We eventually settle the outstanding amount via credit card over the phone after a one-hour long phonecall because *they refused to take payment without an account password which they had updated but never told us of after the switch to the 'home' account*, and ask them to e-mail bills to our company invoices e-mail.

Instead, they decided to send them to an ex-staff members home e-mail who was the one who set up the account five years ago. An e-mail that wasn't even being used anymore, so *nobody saw them*.

Round two: The internet was cut off as we saw no bills. The boss got on the phone to them and got them to forward the latest bill to our e-mail address. 

We tell them to use our invoice e-mail, they assure us that future bills will go to that address. We have the guy on the phone read back to us the address we gave him.

Round three: Still no bills or invoices, service cut off again. At this point, the boss said 'Fuck it' and set up a direct debit. They decided to start posting bills to us *without us asking* and charging us £2.50 each time. which I would stamp with 'uncalled for' after opening, scanning them in, and resealing them and have them RTS'd. Whatever - at least it was all automated now and we wouldn't get cut off again. We get a confirmation of direct debit letter through a couple of days later with all our details on.

Round four: CUT. FUCKING. OFF. Somehow, despite a direct debit being in place, they still have not managed to charge us. We call them up. We give them all the details off the confirmation of direct debit letter. They reveal that they **set up OUR direct debit to a completely random account that has nothing to do with us** and had taken no payments from it. They did not inform us of this problem.

Last straw. We swapped them for a local ISP, and all is good in the world.

**TL:DR: Talk talk really didn't want our money**

Margaret thatcher was elected PM in '79 and began the task of deconstructing our national services shortly afterwards - steel, coal, the railways, the NHS, water, public transport.

Diana was married in '81 and it was pretty much the final really big pomp and circumstance event of the modern monarchy. Public holiday, street parties, huge merchandising.

A year later, we were at war with Argentina over the Falkland Isles, which raised Thatchers' popularity enough for her to easily win a second term.

The 80's were a time of huge social change. Google Yuppies. This marked the rise in power of the banking sector and the rush for wealth acquisition that came with a ""popular"" Conservative government. The music scene changed youth culture, with teenagers solidifying their position as a bankable market in a way the never had before.

The country endured two huge recessions in the 80's, leading to mass unemployment and high inflation, which affected all except the newly super rich.

Look for information on the fall of Thatcher's government, the poll tax riots, the Coal strike...

naturally, you should assume some artistic license, but generally, the film ""The Queen"" is a decent insight into QE2's reaction to Diana's divorce and death, and the reasons for Blair's rise in popularity. Bear in mind that Blair's popularity was high at that point anyway because he wasn't a Tory.

There is no way for people to get into this line of work and no interest in the industry in hiring them. Go and try it yourself if you don't believe me, you'll be disappointed. I know plenty of people here aspiring to work in that industry, some of them with immensely creative CVs. They are hitting a brick wall and most of them have given up entirely.

Why?

Most of the people working in the 'industry' here aren't from here and work seasonally on the tiny number of projects that are filmed here. NI SCREEN couldn't give a flying fuck about supporting local talent, unless you're one of their close friends. Any positions that are available are immediately given to their mates. There are maybe 1 or 2 trainee spots given out per year, which, given that there are hundreds of applicants, amounts to precisely jack shit. And that's with Game of Thrones.

*Changing to a 4-5-1 if Negredo is struggling with Milner/Jovetic coming on and Aguero going upfront and Silva taking the role behind the striker

* Picked Clichy because SAS are fast and he is a bit more defensively minded than Kolarov

* Nastasic is a major long shot and if he's unfit then i honestly don't know who i would prefer out of lescott and Demichelis, usually i would say Demi but in this case i know that Liverpool will be targeting him for penalties

When he brought in the younger players I thought, ""okay, different. We've seen young players win things before elsewhere. They were certainly *better*, but it's worth a shot'.

By the end of last season I really thought he was bringing in a nice passing game that, whilst not providing us with the points we needed, would have us well practiced coming in to this season. Well, god knows what happened, but that passing game just disappeared.

Honestly, I'd have loved to give him five years in the job, but the switch from one type of football to what we've seen this system absolutely disgusts me and I find it hard to want to watch the game.

Where as I beforehand may have given him one more season, dropping him at the beginning of Jan if things aren't working out; I think it'd just be best for all involved if we just brought someone in during the summer to take over and bring us a modern brand of football that many other teams are developing and swiftly leaving us behind.

I'm not asking for a AAA-rated manager, just someone who can motivate and pass the ball along the ground instead of retrieving the ball only to hoof it and leave it up to a 50/50.

true,ArtistEngineer,australia,Cambridgeshire,"I'm on to my 2nd year of Talk Talk ADSL.

For the most part it has been good. I've written about it here in the past, so I won't go in to too much detail.

Generally, I've had ADSL sync faults. Unfortunately they were intermittent. e.g. random noise bursts on the line. This means that if I report it, and a technician comes out, and that technician can't hear the noise on the line for the few minutes that they listen to the line, then it's declared as ""fixed"".

This is cool, I understand the dilemma. I've been using ADSL for over 10 years now at several different house so I've seen every fault situation there is.  Some are really hard to diagnose.

But to be fair to Talk Talk, they did try their best to get my problems sorted.

They've sent me replacement routers, and also technicians who have gone above and beyond what they're allowed to do. e.g. rewire stuff they're not supposed to touch, and make a report based on my observation. The technicians generally can only go on what they observe, not what the customer says. Most of the technicians were very understanding re: intermittent crackling noises on the phone line.

In most cases it's a bad copper wire connection somewhere, so the wire needs to be stripped and re-attached. They've replaced my phone wall plate, rewired the phone line in the pit outside my house and at the junction box down the road.

I generally contact them via Twitter and get a timely response.

The only time they really pissed me off was when my contract was coming to a close and they kept calling me to sell me their TV package upgrade.

I recently moved house, and I signed up with them again. The guy who did the new install put in a new wall plate, and ran brand new copper across the street for us. 11,000/1,000 now.

- You would probably enjoy going up/down Park street. Lots of little cute shops. In fact, the entirety of Clifton you will probably enjoy.
- You may want to check out the harbourside, at the very bottom of Park Street. There's fountains, art galleries and boat rides.
- From there, if it's not too late in the day, visit St Nick's Market. Lots of hippy type shops, bongs, posters, candles, t shirts and all that.
- Across the road, stop by The Commercial Rooms for lunch. It's basically a really nice Wetherspoons pub that used to be a Gentleman's club back in its day.
- Proceed East to get to the City Center. Finish the day by having a little tour around Cabot Circus, possibly watching a film at the top floor Cinema De Lux, or alternatively, there's a mini golf course too in there.
- Bonus points if you're brave enough to proceed onto Stoke's Croft, which is a long road between Cotham and St Pauls. It's very bohemian up there.

If creatives are hitting a wall when they apply for TV and film jobs here, they'll certainly hit a wall when they apply for jobs in London, where the competition is much fiercer.

There are plenty of opportunities in NI. There are a lot more than 2 traineeships per year at NI Screen, I know because I was one of **at least 15** the year that I was accepted.

No person or party on the left would believe capitalism does anything other than exploit the working class. New Labours philosophy is to use capitalism to raise the standards of the working class, by making them middle class,which would work, but would mean greater exploitation of migrant workers, and third world countries,again,something no-one on the left would have any truck with.

Here:http://www.politicalcompass.org/ukparties2010 ,we can see Labour position in relation to other political parties:
Left of the Conservatives, but still on the right. The page also shows the shift from left to right over the decades.
 
From their economic position, to their political philosophy, Labour are right wing. I know nationalists and others on the far-right want to see labour as a cultural Marxist boogeyman, but the fact is they have given migrants a kicking before to appeal to voters.

Yeah, that was kind of my point. But there's been, until recently, no incentive to learn these skills.

&gt;I'm pretty sure H&amp;W wouldn't have any problems hiring skilled local workers. If they don't have the skills needed then they aren't going to be employed.

If you think about it it started with stories, saying, tellings that lived in the memory of your tribe and was passed down from one generation to the next. The wisdom of the dead helping to enrich the living that came after them.

In time we learnt to take the words from our memories and mark them on the world around us. Instead of having to remember every story ever told we only had to keep in mind the key needed to decode and suddenly experience not only didn't have to die with those who had them it didn't have to die with the tribe that kept them. 

We take it for granted that we can pick up a book and read what was written by a person long dead, an indirect link between our thoughts that exist outside of our bodies but we feel that link almost academically. This is because we have only just recently entered and age of almost universal literacy within our societies, which limits that link to the people who could read, who would write a book and have that book be published and important enough to survive. We had to cling to those few who kept diaries and whose diaries were kept for that humanistic link to the past.

And now the walls have been broken down and most people record their lives in a public way that doesn't ever have to be lost because there is no reason for it not to be kept and no need for what they write to be academic, or useful, or artistic, it just has to be human. 

We have always lived on through our language and we now are seeing that in the most basic, human of ways. It's odd, it's both incredibly new and incredibly old and it's going to impact on our society in ways I don't think we've even begun to imagine. 

It won't be all that long until there are [more dead users](http://what-if.xkcd.com/69/) of soicel media services like facebook or twitter than there are live ones and that might seem morbid and strange but I honestly think it's beauitful.

true,PJHart86,,Belfast,"&gt;Then you must be aware that a large number of people who work in film/tv, apart from perhaps the people working on BBC shows, are largely out of work outside GoT season.

I have never worked on Game of Thrones and I haven't been out of work for more than 4 weeks at a time since 2011. Sometimes that's 4 weeks then a couple of days then another 4 weeks but it keeps me ticking over. The BBC is not a fortress, it is possible to get jobs there and a lot of their programmes are made by indies these days.

&gt;There have been 2 trainee positions available in the last 10 months. Not fifteen. Two.

You can't expect there to be a traineeship waiting for you as soon as you need it. When Aim High comes up, apply for that. Apply for CSV. Apply for Skillset training bursaries. Apply for the post-production training scheme if that's what you're in to. There's script training schemes, director shadowing schemes but obviously all these schemes aren't open all the time!

&gt;If you do what most people do, i.e. wait for a crew call on Ni Screen, you'd have had at most 2 opportunities since last summer, none of which were for work last longer than six or so weeks.

This isn't what most people do. Most people *actively* seek out work by contacting production companies, setting up meetings and putting themselves out there every single day that they aren't working. Most people who want to get a job, anyway.

&gt;You seem to be a script reader. I believe I'd be capable of that job, given my professional and academic experience. Unfortunately, my experience professionally is in theatre, not TV.

I am a script reader but I also work in production, mostly as a researcher and sometimes (like now) as a script assistant. I got my first script reading gig by offering to do a trial script report for BBC NI and then busting my balls to make sure it was as good as possible. If you're willing to put your money where your mouth is, there's work out there. Prior to this gig, I had *never* worked as a script supervisor. I'm not in to theatre much but I assume theatre companies need readers too. 

&gt; despite contacting NI Screen and BBC, found zero routes into production, even as a runner, over a number of years. 

If you've been contacting people literally for years and nobody has even offered you an unpaid running gig then the problem is almost certainly with you, not them.

As for Abbie Spallen's comments, I'm sorry to hear that that's her experience.

She is, however, one of only a handful of people to have had an *entire feature film* commissioned and 100% funded by NI Screen (which I worked on) so it's unfair to say that she hasn't had any support at home.

There are professional TV writers working here, just as there are in Glasgow and Birmingham . Living in London certainly isn't a prerequisite.

In fact as London gets [ more expensive and less creative](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/10744997/Cool-London-is-dead-and-the-rich-kids-are-to-blame.html), why bother?

It is news precisely because of the 'shit' since they got Independence and dismissing those issues as 'irrelevant' is a bit misguided. The issues between Ireland and Britain since Independence have been quite noteworthy and significant and at times the relationship between the countries have been very troublesome to say the least. Innocent people died, bombs terrorised the mainland and people in Northern Ireland experienced even worse. Additionally the Irish were aggrieved not just from historical injustices committed by British forces but the subsequent incidents such as Bloody Sunday.

Since 1998 things have improved and there are continually signs of this improvement, interspersed by incidents that remind us what the alternative was, and the *first ever* state visit from the Irish head of State is newsworthy. 

It doesn't matter what *should* have been or what is the *absolute least* that can be as that isn't the context in which this is occurring.

If you are using your overdraft every month by about £3k, you really should look at managing your money better, as normally overdrafts are not cheap.  It may well be cheaper to get a loan or similar other product.

If you've been using the overdraft every month for 15 years, then frankly I can understand the bank wanting to try to push you to use it less, as ultimately £3k is pretty hefty amount for the account they have you on.

Overdrafts are often sold in two ways, the 'pay as you use' model, which charge a % fee based on the amount you are over drawn, or ones that charge fixed fee for any use up to a point.  I think some banks use overdrafts, certainly those given to students, to try and trap you in their system, make you dependent on them for cash flow.  This obviously isn't a good place to be, and is another argument for not using one.

Alternatively, if you are in a high income high turnover situation which means you have irregular payment schedules, say self employed, then look at something like HSBCs Premier offerings, they give £10k over drafts at very low APR.",0,1396954044,null,0,false,0,cgn23zz,t3_22i6yq,t1_cgn23zz,t3_22i6yq,null,1433261219,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I am a software engineer, I've been working in the field for &gt; 10 years now.  Software companies are always keen to upskill / cross skill / train their employees because it improves their productivity.  What they are not prepared to do is hire unskilled people and wait 6 months to a year before  those people are productive, especially when for a slightly greater capital outlay they can source someone who is already skilled.

The analogy is the following:  Would you be comfortable knowing that the surgeon who was about to operate on you had read a whole lot of textbooks on human anatomy but had never actually cut into a cadaver or performed even a minor surgery?  Because I sure as hell wouldn't.  

Now why on earth would I or anyone else sane want to have to endure the exact same situation in a high-stress work environment where a mistake by a trainee could thousands of pounds in terms of outages or lost productivity?

Companies will invest in things that provide a return.  Unskilled graduates require a large investment for a unguessable future return.  Skilled employees with prior experience require a smaller investment and have a proven track record of being able to deliver to a certain benchmark.

This is the problem, and it will not be solved by compelling companies to hire graduates.

The legislation itself seems to prescribe that EU companies retain information for two years, so removing the legislation simply removes the *need* for it to be retained for two years. However, in the absence of this legislation there's nothing *stopping* EU companies from retaining the information for two years or longer, *unless* this piece of legislation overwrote a piece of legislation which made data retention illegal. Therefor, repealment of this law would bring the old law back into effect and stop people from being able to retain such data. However I doubt such a law would have existed pre-2006 or that it would be dealt with quite so sloppily. 

In the immediate future I expect a lot of companies won't keep your meta data because it's worthless to them. However many will because it's easy and might be of use to them.

This will likely be rectified by the coming into force of new legislation soon. The EU Parliament is potentially one of the most outraged institutions on the planet over the Snowden Revelations and the Commission and largely the Council share those concerns. So you can expect legislation soon which will possibly make your data even safer. 

On that note, make sure you that you vote for a pro-data protection party if you want it to continue in May's European Parliamentary Elections, otherwise there's a chance that data protection laws might be dropped off the agenda.

They're a point behind Arsenal with a game in hand and a better goal difference.

true,Mount_Fuji,null,null,"Well firstly, In terms of squad size there is the 25 man rule to consider  



*In the 2010–11 season the Premier League introduced new rules on squad lists. The rules included a cap on the number of players at 25; players under the age of 21 on 1 January of the year in which the season starts are exempt from the list of 25. A ""home-grown rule"" also requires clubs to name at least eight players in their squad of 25 players that have been registered domestically for a minimum of three seasons prior to their 21st birthday.*  



This may not be a problem for us but in the long run, looking at the squad I think we're going to have some real difficulties shifting some of the dead wood which may hamper our signings down the road.   




Working on 2 players that can play each position and the assumption that we release Hutton, bring in Bertrand and Lambert doesn't promote any youth players to the first team (such as Donacien, Stevens (I think his contact ends this year though), Gardner, Carruthers, Johnson and Robinson) here is the squad.  




* GK - Guzan, Steer, Given (contract ends '16)


* LB - Bertrand, Luna, Bennett (with Clark and Baker as backup in this position)


* RB - Lowton, Bacuna


* CB - Baker, Vlaar, Okore, Clark


* Various Mid positions: El Ahmadi, Westwood, Delph, Albrighton, Sylla, Herd, Tonev, Nzogbia (contract ends '16), (with Bacuna as backup in this position)


* Attacking positions:Benteke, Weimann, Agbonlahor, Kozak, Helenius, Bowery, Holt, Bent (contract ends '16 I think), Delfouneso (not sure when his contract ends)  



It's pretty bloated and he's going to have to make a decision on what players he brings in and how he plays.   




Assuming that the first team spine, once settled, is Guzan -&gt; Vlaar/Okore -&gt; Delph -&gt; Benteke/Gabby the gaps need to be filled and that list seems to be full of fillers rather than actual competition or further additions to the spine.   




To answer your initial question (sorry, rant mode engaged) I think that he's going to have to shift some of the players to lesser leagues and at least complement the first team spine by adding a creative midfielder. I feel that Westwood and Delph are good enough and El Ahmadi and Bacuna are decent backups. I think Lowton and Bertrand are good enough starters and that only leaves another striker/winger and I'd really like Albrighton to get a crack at that, once again with Bacuna and maybe Weimann in reserve. The vacant spot is a creative midfielder, maybe in the Merson role. ",0,1396956324,null,0,false,0,cgn2ia4,t3_22hp63,t1_cgn2ia4,t3_22hp63,null,1433261404,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

true,whencanistop,null,null,"&gt; You know, if you are struggling so hard to recruit people, maybe your organisation should start considering in-house training of inexperienced new graduates.

We do train people in the job for specialist skills they would need, but we can't have people working in the organisation who aren't client facing for too long and 99% of graduates need to be taught how to 'work' first.  Some of the graduates I have worked with when I've been in house in the past barely seem able to string an email together, their grammar is awful and their knowledge of basics like Office atrocious.  As a small organisation (30 odd consultants) we can't molly coddle someone through that stage of having to proof read emails, rewrite presentations or documents and double check work.

Sure - do it in the larger organisations where the person works in house and learns those skills or in an agency where they can hide behind an account manager without ever seeing a client.  The trouble is that there are too few of those people coming through to the next stage.

In the analytics world it is worse.  [Here are 75 jobs in London for over £26k (at least)](http://www.totaljobs.com/JobSearch/Results.aspx?Keywords=%22web+Analytics%22&amp;Rate=26000&amp;RateType=1&amp;LTxt=London&amp;Radius=5) and they can't fill them.  I know they can't fill them because the recruitment consultants keep ringing me up about the same set of jobs over and over asking if I know anyone who can do it.  When someone does fill it, the position they left ends up in the same loop.  This isn't even about training graduates.  We run hundreds of free events where someone who wants to do this could come long and get some experience.  We organise a unconference (in our own free time!) every 6 months which is free to attend and you can learn loads of stuff from people who are experienced in this plus network with those in the industry.  We had  jobs board advertising all sorts of jobs including graduate ones, we ran training courses on the day before at £95 (a fraction of the cost of going to one of the big tool companies) and we couldn't sell out, including the ones for beginners.

Much of the blame has been directed towards the club's quiet, vigilant owner Randy Lerner, the easiest of targets. Fans feel the American has not helped Villa out when they need it most. The opposite is true.
The club cannot offer hefty wages, haven't spent over £8million on a player since 2011 and are forced to buy cheap. This much is true.
But Lerner is attempting to make Villa sustainable, self-sufficient, and more importantly, is not rewarding failure with cash. An old-fashioned yet commendable way of running a football club. In today's age of quick fixes, this was never going to sit well.
Criticism should be reserved.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"So I promised I'd respond. I can disagree with most of what he said simply because it's based on several false concepts. 

Firstly, he's set up a dichotomy that doesn't exist. There is no ""Islam"". It's 1.2 billion people, 1400 years of history and theological development. Even just getting down to the level of British Muslims you're talking about several groups and divisions that do not agree with each other. The idea that there is a ""British Islam"" and an amorphous ""Islam"" is plainly idiotic but people labour under the categorisation because that's how the narrative spills out.

His approach isn't simple at all. It has two problems, the first that he seems to think that ideas in of themselves have a structural independence that is free of any other constraints or influences. In his construction there is no influence of power, acceptance, legitimacy or historical context on the idea in of itself and the idea/belief as a construct in society. 

Secondly. tolerance is actually the opposite of what he defines. To tolerate is to accept and not criticise. It is a passive phase, the criticism then makes it active. I tolerate a child running around in my space, once I tell the parent to control the child - I am no longer tolerating. I am then actively trying to influence the behaviour of that parent and thus the child. 

Thus his use of the word tolerance is wrong - he's not tolerating at all. He's actually demanding the right to interject and intervene where he feels the moral/ normative claims of a belief are wrong. 

So one must ask why he uses the word. Well, it's because he wants to claim legitimacy with the audience. ""I'm tolerant"" is a signal of what he wants your perception to be, or even his own perception of himself. That he is a person that is ""normal"" and within the accepted bounds of what you would find reasonable and that builds support for his later claim that his demand for active criticism is actually tolerance. 

I could go on about the symbolic importance of the word Tolerance and the importance it plays in mediating the difference between communities in a vision of multi-culturalism but I'm sure you can dive in to work by many people on the subject including the late Stuart Hall. So , I won't bother. 

Let's talk about is edit. It's classic clash of civilisation stuff, preached by the many NeoCons who sent our society into a spin. He seems to be ignorant of the industrial revolution and modernity being a historic movement that encompassed all of the world through various mechanisms such as global capitalism. We're all modern in the sense that the world has been throughly joined together.

Even historically speaking, the ""Islam"" that he talks about is a production of modernity and bears very little to the Islam of his imagination. The people who were the intellectual forebears of the extremists are people who wrote in the late 19th and early 20th century and not before that ie. Hasan Al Bannah and Sayid Qutb.  On top of that not all of them agreed. People like Abdu, Afghani and Sir Syed Ahmed Khan were very different writers with very different projects. 

Also it's factually untrue. People criticise ""Islam"" all the time. I showed you the report. 

Secondly, he makes claim that its an Ideology. Which it's not. Rewind back to the point about 1.4 billion muslims. He's pushing a position that 1.4 billion people all sign up to an ideology. That's patent nonsense. 

Thirdly the edit contradicts the first post. How can there be a dangerous ""fringe element"" and yet he claims that ""Islam"" is an ideology thus encompassing all of its adherents. ",0,1396957302,null,0,false,0,cgn2pg0,t3_21qlvv,t1_cgn2pg0,t1_cgfmo9a,null,1433261498,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Mordisquitos,null,null,"&gt;What benefit does a company obtain from hiring an unskilled person and training them up as opposed to hiring a skilled person who can do their job from the first day?

Well if they can hire a skilled person who can do their job from the first day there is no skill shortage then, is there? If there is a skill shortage, however, the benefit they obtain is to eventually get a productive worker after 6 to 12 months and a large investment. It's what happens in a free economy when something is in short supply: it costs more to get it.

On the other hand, your surgeon analogy is extremely relevant. Why do we have skilled surgeons? Because the NHS is willing to lay out the appropriate means for recently graduated medical students to acquire the skills they need through vocational training in the Foundation Programme, followed by specialist training. The NHS is willing to invest in training surgeons instead of whinging about how hard it is to find a fully qualified surgeon and refusing to train them.

Everything has a cost, every investment carries risk, and for a company to grow it must be willing to invest in its premises, technology, supplies and yes, in training. However, too many businesses want something for nothing, and instead of investing themselves they want to leech off the investment made by either:

+ Other businesses -- which is fair enough, and is a very reasonable strategy when there is a skill surplus.

+ The taxpayers, according to some who would want the Government to provide and fund more vocational training.

+ Other countries and foreign businesses, by insisting that the Government should relax visa requirements for skilled workers(*).

+ Graduates, who should apparently spend their time and money taking on unpaid internships just to be eligible to work.

To summarise, I agree that businesses should be free to follow whatever recruitment strategy they prefer, and if they can survive hiring only skilled workers, that's fair enough. However, if that's the path they choose, they shouldn't expect the taxpayers, the Government, or graduates to compensate for their unwillingness to invest or take risks.

_(*) On a macro scale, it could be argued that this is also leeching off the UK/EU public, who have put up with a higher cost of living and training than some foreign nationals.

Think of the McLeish season. We were playing truly dire football, with ageing overpaid players to scrap a 0-0 draw at home.

People complain about Lambert's tactical ineptness but I really don't think it's as bad as people assume. It seems like most people can't look past our last game. Yes we were poor against Fulham, but remember that was without Delph, Agbonlahor and Benteke, our best midfielder and best two strikers,of course it won't be excellent. Look at some of our earlier games this season where Lambert has been excellent; the big wins against Chelsea, Arsenal and City as well as the wins against West Brom and Norwich etc. I think it's harsh to say he's tactical inept when it's obvious most of our problems going forward lie in the fact we don't have a quality CAM. You may blame Lambert for that but it's not as if he's been trying to get one (Holtby and Hoolahan). Also, Lambert appears to have been trying to strengthen the defence as a priority, we the signings of Luna, Bertrand, Vlaar, Lowton and Bacuna doing this.

One of the biggest criticisms of the pre-Lambert era was the wages. Between O'Neill, Houllier and McLeish we created a squad where the likes of Given, Ireland, N'Zogbia and Bent earned huge amounts without giving much on the pitch. They've all been cut out by Lambert and by this summer most will be gone. They've been replaced by the likes of Guzan, Westwood and Benteke who have proven to be better, for less wages.

Not only do we have a decent squad now and when fully fit, with the addition of a CAM, a first XI worthy of the top 10, but it's a young team as well. Only Guzan, Agbonlahor, Vlaar and Holt are over 27. That means the majority of our still probably still haven't reached their potential. They're already Premier League quality players, they could be excellent in a few years.

People have been saying our signings have been too hit-and-miss but doesn't every manager have that? Yes Lambert has had Holt, Tonev and Bennett but O'Neill had Hutton, Beye and Heskey. Some signings have been great. Vlaar, Lowton, Bacuna, Bertrand, Westwood, El Ahmadi and Benteke have all beeen great signings. And credit has to go to Lambert for making them able to adapt to the Premier League.

It does feel like more and more of this sub are turning on Lambert but I have and will stand by him. We're not far from returning to the top half consistently.

As most appear to be anti-Lambert, instead of downvoting, tell me why you disagree.",0,1396959148,null,0,false,0,cgn34eg,t3_22hsn4,t1_cgn34eg,t3_22hsn4,null,1433261694,12,false,avfc,t5_2s569,12

true,PJHart86,,Belfast,"&gt;Well, actually, it is a fortress, as even the more successful writers, researchers and producers will openly acknowledge.

It's very competitive, as one would expect from the world's largest broadcaster, but they do run a lot of training schemes, Including CSV, which takes job seekers and places on network programmes like The One Show and Reuinted. I think you get an NVQ out of it as well.

&gt;I applied for Aim High, with over a thousand applicants. Got to the last 50, but no cigar.

Ok, so you didn't get it but the 25 people who did get it since 2011 (myself included) are now well on their way to viable careers in the industry. It was very competitive and a lot of the successful applicants (not including myself) had been through the CSV training scheme first, maybe that's something you could look at? Just because you weren't successful doesn't make the scheme any less valid.

&gt;I have done that. It never really went anywhere. People largely seem to not want to be bothered with queries. No one is looking for under-experienced workers.

If you have zero experience in the industry then go out and make something yourself. It's 2014, everyone has a HD camera in their pocket. Take some initiative, write direct and produce something of your own. If you have something you can show people then they're more likely to take notice.

&gt;Where? I've never once seen such a job promoted anywhere. As for general BBC applications, you're up against 1000 other people for 8 spots. So, again, not exactly a booming industry.

NI Screen advertised a script reading job last December and I think they hired maybe 10 of us in total. I had zero professional script reading experience when I applied. Just because an industry is competitive doesn't mean it isn't booming.

&gt;Seems like a bit of a presumptious, catty response. I'd like to assure you that you're mistaken, but I don't think you'd believe me. Even if you are wrong. I'd wonder what qualifies you to assume such a thing.

Sorry, that did come across  a bit catty. All I mean is that dozens of programmes have been made here in the last few years, if you really have approached all of them and nobody has offered you even one day running then it seems very possible that there is something wrong with your approach.

&gt;She received support after leaving, finding success and then returning. Her comments about cronyism are entirely valid.

It seems like this criticism is directed more at the theatre industry and I can't really speak to that. Writers like Abbie have left and found success, others like Terry Caffola have stayed and found success, that's all I know.

&gt;Look, all in all I understand that it's an extremely difficult nut to crack, but unfortunately you don't seem to acknowledge that despite real attempts, people, not just me, find it extremely difficult to get anywhere.

I 100% agree that it is a tough nut to crack, but this is as much the fault of the nut cracker as it is the nut. Again, just because an industry is competitive doesn't mean it isn't booming.

&gt;to pretend that the industry is doing well, or that its even beginning to be a viable career is simply untrue, regardless of your personal, extremely fortunate circumstances.

Nobody is pretending that the industry is doing well, it just is. Game of Thrones was estimated to have brought £43 million to the local economy in 2012, up to £80 million by 2014.

BBC NI and local indies are regularly contributing to UK network content and entertainment formats by local companies like Green Inc and Wild Rover are being picked up internationally. The people who work for all these companies have viable careers.

There has been focused investment in the media as well as IT sectors here and both seem to be doing well as a result. One is smaller than the other, but that's how it is everywhere outside of Hollywood.

I may be lucky, as you say, but I made my own luck. I worked part time in a shop for years on top of 12 hour shoot days when I was starting out. I taught English in China to broaden my CV. I spent as many spare minutes as I could writing, playing with cameras, making short films and reading everything I could about the industry, figuring out who to contact and how best to spend my time.

Of course not everyone who wants to break in to the industry will, but I can tell you from personal experience that it's hard work that cracks the nut, not luck.",0,1396959698,null,0,1396983424,0,cgn39fx,t3_22f1ph,t1_cgn39fx,t1_cgn26ef,null,1433261826,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

We've actually debated this quite a bit and I'm in favour of picking up graduates for some roles.

You can see why he'd be happier paying an extra £5k to £10k hiring someone with 6 months to a year experience when he'll make his money back after 20 - 30 days of extra chargeable time.

Here's where we disagree. Again, it depends where we are in the UK, but where I am now (in the south-east), it's a major problem. 

I remember when a house was a place to live. Rather, now it's an investment for people who have no intention of living in it. 

If I was born and grew up here, and I'm on minimum wage or slightly above, and I want to buy a house, it's impossible. I would be forced to live in council housing (and get accused of being a scrounger). 

In the meantime, people who can ""stump up the money"" as you say, are treating housing not like a place for themselves to live in but like an investment - thus driving prices up (and not salaries...) and crowding out those who earn less.

Food - a good kebab, wispa &amp; boost bars, proper chocolate in general (not sour American stuff), a good battered fish and chips, curry the way it should be.

Weather - the fact it's never too cold or too hot to go outside. Here it goes from -40 to 120 F - leaving less than 6 months of the year where I enjoy being outside. 

Towns - pubs, stuff being local (just nip out to the newsagent on a Sunday morning), shopping being in the bustling city center and not a desolate strip mall on the edge of town, fucking paths to walk or bike on (""why y'all want to be walkin"" - America)

Personal - friends, family

Other - BBC, less insane politics, a work environment where having a pint at lunchtime is the norm.

Biggest miss - the fucking NHS. Healthcare here is a joke - I turned down getting an MRI the other day because I couldn't afford the $2k it would have cost me out of pocket even with insurance.

A few of the supermarkets here have british sections so that tends to tide me over a little (got my weetabix, the odd tin of baked beans and a yorkie bar).

I don't have an opinion on the solution to this kind of problem yet, I need to think about it some more. Having said that, I think it's important to note another point of view; to many devout religious people, the rules of their god and religion transcend rules set by other humans. That's kinda the point of religious devotion. Most of the time the two are compatible and everyone gets along fine, but when your religious beliefs dictate one thing and the law dictates another you're bound to follow your faith, there's no real question. 

It's our responsibility to maintain that compatibility at the same time as doing what's best for society, and if we want to continue to be free and liberal it is imperative that we respect people's religious beliefs.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's a ridiculous headline. It is fair to suggest he is doing a poor job, not that he needs a miracle to save it. He's rumoured to be in talks over a new contract for god's sake!

Lambert won't be sacked if he continues to work within the parameters set by Lerner unless we spend a significant amount of time in the relegation zone, get relegated or the fans go into total mutiny (attendances less than 20,000 at Villa Park, mass protests).


That's not to say I think he's doing a good enough job. Talk of a new contract really worries me - the board are completely clueless and if they think that Lambert getting us to hover around 40 points, even on a low budget, is acceptable that is seriously frightening. [This is a great article written by a Villa fan the other day that I think sums up our issues perfectly](http://football.chrisnee.co.uk/2014/04/aston-villa-stagnant-helpless-and.html).


If I were in charge, I would sack him if we get less than 40 points this season. If we get 40+, I would give him one more season to prove he can offer more. It is still really important for us to have stability and not have to start from scratch every time a new manager comes in. Lambert is still halfway through rebuilding the squad and I don't think we have that stability yet. That's really the only reason I would give him more time.


If there is one positive about Lambert it is that when he leaves the squad will be in a much more manageable state than when he arrived. Any potential new manager won't have to focus on chopping cripplingly expensive deadwood, more on upgrading quality. We may not be the most attractive option for a new manager but maintaining a small budget and trying to improve is much more attractive than having to gut the squad and start over with minimal funds. It was a very difficult job Lambert took on with very little prospect of reward. That he has made the job for the next man slightly easier and more desirable is the only mitigating factor to his failure for me.",0,1396961295,null,0,1396961718,0,cgn3ozm,t3_22hsn4,t1_cgn3ozm,t3_22hsn4,null,1433262031,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

I think the same is probably true of many newspapers.

If you want to predict the future, extrapolate based on past and present processes and their likely results.

However you have to have lived a certain amount of time in order to witness this social change. Anyone born after widespread internet penetration will think this is normal, when, it is not. But it is now, and this normality will spread. Young people are more likely to relate to website communities than they are their neighbours or others within their town.

But the main thing is people being orderly, civilised and using common fucking sense.

I live in China and just walking down the road is fraught with frustration everyday. Everyone walks five abreast, people stop on busy stairs at rush hour to check their phones, people pile into lifts and subway trains before letting anyone out, and not a single person knows how to queue. Honestly, it's endlessly frustrating when something as simple as waiting your turn to buy something in a shop becomes some sort of peasant rugby scrum. Don't even get me started on the Chinese's complete and utter ignorance of germ theory and basic hygiene...

It caused literally 100% of my culture shock and for a long term I genuinely hated 99% of Chinese people. Now I just don't give a shit. I'll starfish you if you don't let me out the lift, I'll pull you back if you try to cut infront of me in the queue and you'll get your trolley thrown across the supermarket if you smash it into my foot. I realise that I've descended to their selfish, animalistic level, but it's the only way to survive. Luckily I have a demanding job and a demanding wife, so I don't get out much!

Not if you want to avoid prison.  Which is the way it should be.  Otherwise we'd still have people burning people as witches etc...

&gt; It isn't so simple as casting them out because they don't fit the norms or traditions of our society.

No-one's talking about casting anyone out.  Believe what you want to believe in private, individually.  Our secular laws exist and apply to everyone in society regardless of individual religious conviction.  

Everyone should be prepared to leave their religious observances and coddling at the door of the court room.  If you want to live somewhere where you'll be judged under religious law, there are plenty of places in the world where you can live under those conditions.  

People who try to undermine the justice system by pissing about with religious nonsense in court want to have their cake and eat it; they want the even-handedness and rights that a secular justice system brings to the collective, while enjoying their special snowflake privileges.

I then worked the shit out of that company for 18 months until a good opportunity came up for a permanent position at about £2k a year more that took me out of the bottom 10% of earners.  I got lucky since then (although I worked hard in work and outside of work, going to industry events, getting involved in the community, writing blogs, etc).

But my first job wasn't a graduate job.  I earned in the bottom 10% of earners.  I had to stay living at home because I couldn't afford to move out.  It took years before I was earning enough to pay back my student loan at anything beyond the rate of interest.  I didn't move out of home until I was in my mid 20s and that was only because I had a couple of lucky job moves due to varying politics.

Having worked in house at organisations who have graduate programs, it is incredibly frustrating to watch a bunch of people who start on a salary that was double what I got when I started, half of whom generally just didn't give a fuck.  They sit out their graduate position and then leave at the first opportunity to a higher paid job with a rival or an agency or decide that they didn't like that industry or role and move to something else.

Why would I want to put graduates on an expensive scheme, hire people to manage and train them only for them to repay it by leaving as soon as they can.  I don't buy a computer that I pay a huge amount of money on software for only for it to break after 6 months, why would I do that with an employee?

My advice is to find a company and put a stint in doing a crappy, low level job.

There are many throughout Scotland, and if planned properly, and dependent on how your walking plan, you can almost stay in one every night on the Way. I have done this a couple of times and can provide help as and when needed.

A bothy is a small structure that was often built in the far reaches of farming areas to allow workers to stay while tending to animals in remote places. Many have now been re-purposed as shelters for walking enthusiasts and are a welcome sight after a long days walking. They are maintained by a group of volunteers and you can find a list at the [Mountain Bothies Association](http://www.mountainbothies.org.uk/). Bear in mind that the condition of these places often change due to weather, people leaving litter etc. but generally you will be surprised at what you discover, fire places, sleeping decks. 

The advantage of a bothy is that it is free and you do not necessarily need to carry a tent and poles (although please take an emergency shelter / bivouac and foil blanket just in case). This may make your trip lighter.

There are also a few camping places on the Way that have ""hobbit huts"" to stay in which are cheap, permanent camping hut accommodation such as at [Beinglas](http://www.beinglascampsite.co.uk/). 

Hope that helps. Any queries, give me a shout.

I have the 2014 ER6n (unrestricted) and my friend has the 2013 ER6f (A2 restricted)

I've been very impressed with the bike so far. It's been very easy to get used to as my first big bike, to my eyes, it looks much better than the similarly priced Yamahas and Hondas. 

I enjoy the smaller details, like the petal brake rotors, tubular frame and swing arm. They make it look much more premium in my opinion. Also, I love the dash on the ER6n. It looks awesome at night and a full current avg and range trip computer is a nice touch. 


As for the restriction, my friends bike has no noticeable disadvantage compared to mine. He seemed to have the same amount of power, he just cant use the full throttle range, which only hampers full throttle acceleration but even then, he kept up. 

Both bikes are frugal too. We just did around 350 miles this weekend and I averaged 57mpg and he 62mpg. That's with a fair bit of playing in the twisties and... 'Comparing bikes' on the motorway. 
I imagine his fairing and weighing a lot less made the difference. 

Kawasaki's finance deals are also unbeatable at the moment. 0% if you are happy to commit to the bike for 1,2 or 3 years. 

My only criticisms of it are, that a couple of plastic body parts can come across a little cheap. But that's expected because it is... 
Also, the brakes aren't super powerful but I prefer that as a learner, less likely to lock up.

I like the idea of having an un-elected second chamber that has the freedom to debate openly without having to worry about the next election.

We just need a simple deliberatory body that can scrutinise whatever reactionary policy the Commons comes up with next and send it back if it's not in Joe Public's best interest.

Think the method of appointment does needs reforming - hereditary peerages in particular should be consigned to history. Anyone sitting in the Lords should be there for their expertise in a particular field and not just 'because'. I'd agree on the system, as you mention, where members are appointed by an independent body either for life or a sufficient single term of say 10-15 years, and represent as wide a demographic as possible with experts from a variety of fields - eminent scientists, businessman, lawyers, educators, health professionals, politicians etc. - not too far off what the Lords currently is, when you think about it (peerage system aside).",0,1396965062,null,0,1396965269,0,cgn4xxq,t3_22ibsv,t1_cgn4xxq,t1_cgn4b0r,null,1433262618,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

I miss daylight savings time.  Here it gets light ridiculously early in the morning.  I miss those long summer evenings.

I miss fitting in.  I don't look Asian and people are nice but I am reminded that I am different pretty much every single day.  People don't talk to you because they think you won't understand (and to be honest, I think it's the fault of immigrants, 95% have terrible language skills).

 * **the food** 
I miss a nice big fry-up, a proper english breakfast! Here they give you a tiny croissant and a coffee, which is fine if you're in a rush on your way to work, but it doesn't satisfy my need for a fatty breakfast. Finding a good curry is hard here and takeaway is generally more expensive and subpar. Also forget ordering a pizza past 10pm. Used to order dominoes at 4am after a night out in the UK and was distraught when I found out they didn't do that here.

* **late night super markets and delivery**
In the UK I used to be able to go to asda at anytime at night and go shopping, it was great! Shops close at ""normal"" hours here and are rarely open on Sundays. 

* **politeness/kindness** 
While this isn't applicable everywhere in the UK, people in Paris are *generally* far less welcoming and polite from restaurants to commuters  to customer service. I once had no power from friday to monday because the electric company (who was at fault) didn't do visits on weekends. 

and finally **cost of going out**
This doesn't apply to London however, which is about the same. But going out in Brighton for example, is far cheaper, easier to get into clubs, and more fun for some reason. Paris is just too expensive when it comes to nightlife. While there are some cheap bars, the average pint will be 6-8€ (5 if happy hour) and it just goes up from there.",0,1396965582,null,0,false,0,cgn5558,t3_22i9iv,t1_cgn5558,t3_22i9iv,null,1433262711,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

- The NHS. I needed a blood test a few months ago. $190. That's _with_ insurance, by the way. My current insurance premium for my wife and I is $630 per month, and again, if we get sick we still have to pay to use healthcare. Just not as much as if we were uninsured.

- British TV. In fairness, I do still get to watch most of what I want through other means, though.

- Food, occasionally. The food here is great, but I do miss things like proper fish &amp; chips, biscuits, chocolate etc. that the UK just does better.

- London. It's the best city in the world IMO, and I miss visiting it whenever I want. Similarly: old stuff. Nothing in the US is _really_ old (except natural things). It's sometimes nice to feel like you're walking amongst history in the UK. It blows people's minds when I tell them the church in my town was built in the 1200s.

- Religion not being a big part of life. In the US, but especially where I am, there's a church every 10ft and just about everyone is religious. I've got no problem with people have religious beliefs but I wish it wasn't such a public thing here. It influences every aspect of life, including politics. The UK has a much better approach.

- Music. When big acts visit the UK, most of us are usually no more than a train ride away from one of the venues. I'm in a tiny city in the US, so there's no hope of bigger acts ever playing near here. I guess this hints at the wider point - everything in the UK is close together, relatively speaking. I went to a kid's birthday party last weekend and the venue was an hour's drive away to the next town over. No-one here thinks that's unusual.

- Pubs. I'm not even a drinker, but I miss the atmosphere of a pub. There's not really anything similar where I am.

- Family, obviously.

There are two reasons the Lords actually works:

1. They aren't in power. This can't be stressed enough. The Lords aren't people licking their lips at how they can ab/use a power because they don't have that power. This gives them a position closer to the general public who also aren't going to use this power. Just by not being government or dominated by government they have a very different perspective.  

2. Not subject to re-election. This one is obvious. If you haven't got to fight an election campaign then you don't have to make any odious compromises.

Strong government that talks tough, low and stable inflation/interest rates, a solid consumer base and relatively low unemployment. Sure, we had the riots a few years back, but that was short lived and people still come from all over the world to work, live, play and invest here. On top of that talk of shrinking the public sector provides reliability that tax rises are unlikely to take place. 

It was always given that unless the EZ collapsed completely the UK was going to roar back. London and the SE never really saw a recession, and as far as I'm concerned the past year has been absolutely corking in economic terms.

true,withabeard,null,null,"&gt; One in five graduates leave their first job after 6 months and 42% leave after 18 months

I can see why, but I think the numbers here may well be slightly skewed. Graduate schemes and ""graduate jobs"" tend to be low paid and are aimed at short term prospects. The jobs are basically designed to be left early on. Also, this is the first job for many people and they may well have just realised that this isn't the career for them.

I know when I started the job I'm in now, I made my boss aware I am ambitious and am looking to grow a solid career. Not long after I started he mentioned he was only looking for me to be around for ~1 year.

It's now been 3.4 years. What my boss did was made sure that my job title/description/pressure/prospects/salary have all grown steadily roughly every 6 months. I started as very low paid compared to other people working with me and have grown to the level they all are in almost all ways. One thing I've noticed (and have since discussed with my boss) is I would be promoted each time I started cruising at my job. He has said this was very deliberate. If I was able to complete my weekly activities and have time to doss about, clearly I am able to do more and so he pulled me up into a position to do more. Some people would have bashed me down as lazy and unwilling to push. I guess me and my boss have found the middle road, by him providing a challenge I've always risen to it and progressed.

I think what I'm trying to say, is if you can put in a little time to people and continue to challenge them. All while paying them a fair wage with obvious progression to a better one. Then those people have little to no reason to leave.

Tom Baker's last season often gave the impression that he was weary of the role after seven years, and just phoning it in.

Season 22 had such insightful social commentary as *Vengeance on Varos*... but it also had *Timelash*.

The writing in season 24 was almost uniformly appalling... but season 25 was quite good in places, and season 26 was perhaps one of the best the show had ever seen.

&gt;

&gt;The __Cartmel Masterplan__ is a fan name for the planned *[Doctor Who](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)* [backstory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstory) developed primarily by [Andrew Cartmel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cartmel), [Ben Aaronovitch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Aaronovitch), and [Marc Platt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Platt_(writer\)), which they intended to restore some of the mystery of [the Doctor's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)) background that had been lost through revelation of the existing backstory.  Although hints were dropped in the last two seasons, the proposed revelations never materialised on screen as the programme was taken off the airwaves in 1989.

&gt;Some of the stories during the [Seventh Doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Doctor)'s tenure were intended to deal with the lack of mystery by suggesting that much of what was believed about the Doctor was wrong and that he was a far more powerful and mysterious figure than previously thought. In an untelevised scene in *[Remembrance of the Daleks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_the_Daleks)*, the Doctor stated that he was ""far more than just another [Time Lord](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord)."" In *[Silver Nemesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Nemesis)*, lines about the creation of [validium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_items#Validium) and Lady Peinforte knowing the Doctor's secrets were meant to point towards this mystery. 

&gt;The suspension of the series in 1989 meant that none of these hints were ever resolved.  The ""Masterplan"" was used as a guide for the [Virgin New Adventures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_New_Adventures) series of novels featuring the Seventh Doctor,  and the revelations about the Doctor's origins were written into the novel *[Lungbarrow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungbarrow)* by Marc Platt.

The bigger problem is it needed to be a multi pronged approach. The government needed to encourage people to get degrees, professional qualifications or apprenticeships in areas where we could then encourage businesses to move to the UK. Once all that was under way then we would court all the companies in those fields to get them to relocate.

The saying is ""capital knows no boundaries"" and that's true, the money will always go where it makes the most money. If we have a highly educated, highly productive workforce, people will clamour to open businesses here. You can't do it the other way around.

Furthermore, I'd hope we're not thinking of buying too many players soon, so from a transfer perspective, Baldini would hardly be missed.

Worth noting, the argument here isn't that Adebolajo is so damned lovely that we should be nice to him. It's that human rights protections forbid the implementation of a whole-life sentence. 

Why? 

The Court in Strasbourg [ruled](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/sites/fra/pages/search.aspx?i=001-122664#{""itemid"":[""001-122664""]}) that a prison sentence without the prospect of release is a disproportionate and inhuman sentence. 

Our ""life sentences"" are currently split into two parts: a tariff (which must be served in full) and then an indeterminate period of additional detention during which we assess whether the prisoner is safe to be released. If they are never deemed safe to be released, then they die in prison. The European Court of Human Rights finds these sentences compatible with the Convention. However, a determination that someone will never be released, regardless of their behaviour in prison, rehabilitation, development etc. is disproportionate. In essence: we already have a procedure to keep people in prison for life and the only people that whole-life tariffs affect are those who *are* safe to be released but never can be.

It's inhuman because people with long sentences, in practice, operate on the basis of hope: that hope that they may one day be released. The Court said that removing that hope is inhumane, especially because the longer someone is in prison the more valuable that hope becomes.

Or so says the Court.

The UK government argued that because the Home Secretary can offer compassionate leave, that they do have a chance of release. Our Court of Appeal [agreed,](http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/Resources/JCO/Documents/Judgments/r-v-mcloughlin-and-r-v-newell.pdf) saying that the Court was wrong to say that there was no chance of release.

Food-wise its much worse in terms of the price and availability of food in supermarkets. You'll get a decent fare eating out though but its expensive.  
Cost of living is roughly the same except for the food. Wages are a bit lower though which creates a bit of a struggle for some.  
Culture of the people in the 16 - 40 bracket is getting on for identical. We all watch the same shows, have approximately the same values, most of these people speak great English too (you can avoid learning the language if you wish).  
Work wise its a touch different. Because everyone knows everyone networking is a bit more important than in Blighty. You might be better off finding work through people instead of blindly sending your CV out.  
Play-wise its different. Everyone goes out approximately 2am on Friday/Saturday, town is mostly dead @ 10pm or 11pm. During the week its more like home though with closing times @ 1am.  
You can only buy alcohol from bars or state sponsored stores (that close at 18:00).  
Dating-wise its a bit weird, people don't date so much. Apparently its more common to go out, get plastered and if you wake up in the same bed as someone two weeks in a row then you're ""dating"". Or something.... I dunno I have issues with this bit as conversation for me is a massive part of foreplay..... so this doesn't work out so well for me.

You may find some, but the odds are that there will be others from other countries. Now, you could limit how many of the best you can attract, and thus make this league not as awesome as it is. Or you can open up to all of the best players, and enjoy the fact that they come flocking.

The competition from top clubs for the 20 elite English players would be fierce, and would drive the price up, while sending top international talent to other leagues for lower prices and reduce the allure (and money) of PL football.

true,UndercoverFiretruck,1986,,"Have you actually seen either player enough to fairly compare them? I don't mean to call you out but unless you consistently watch PSG and Atlético play, then there is no way you can draw that sort of conclusion. YouTube highlights don't count either. I'm not putting myself on a high horse here. I'll be the first to admit I don't know nearly enough or haven't watched enough about either one to tell you who's a better fit or better overall player. Yes I do have my preference in Costa, and that's from reading up on him after that scout report WAGNH published a few weeks back, but I'm not going to tell you he's better than Cavani. I'll trust whoever Mourinho decides is the best candidate. 

That said, even IF Cavani was the better player, do you know how minimal the chances are of a transfer? He just moved a year ago and signed long term to PSG. And PSG isn't just any club. We're talking about a club that has no need to sell and can actually financially compete with us. Want me to put it in perspective? You know how quick we are to tell PSG to sod off about Hazard and Oscar. Yea, that's them with us and Cavani. We don't want their money, we'd rather keep our players, right? Yet Mourinho has publically stated that if stupid money (can't remember the fee he used) was offered by PSG, the club would be bullocks to not consider it. So while not out of the question, we would likewise have to offer stupid money for Cavani. Even more than for Torres would be my guess, and with FFP in full swing that's not a luxury the club can afford. We still have to reinforce in other areas of the squad if we're going to challenge on all fronts next season. Which is why I think Costa is the better option. Cheaper, younger, and much more feasible than Cavani. Honestly I'd rather take Costa with the chance of also getting Shaw or Sandro (from Porto) or Rodriguez (from Bayer) and a midfielder for depth rather than blowing all the cash we have on one player. 

I'll end it with this. Cavani is earning more in a month than most people make in their lifetime, while living in one of the most cultured cities in the world, also while being one of the first names on the team sheet (albeit he's being played in his secondary position but to be fair a handful of strikers in the world would be within shout of displacing Ibra in his current form upfront) of a club who has the domestic league all but wrapped up and is in serious contention for the Champions League and he's STILL unhappy and if the rumors are true, angling for a move away just after a year there. What's the guarantee it won't be the same with Chelsea? We'll most likely be favorites for the title next season, hopefully challenge for the CL, and offer him a good wage and that might not be enough for him... We're looking for some stability upfront, not someone who's going to force us to find yet a new striker a year later. Costa, in my opinion, is that striker that we need.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I agree with what you are saying but would throw in another question.

Why are English players never encouraged to go to foreign leagues to ply their trade? 

Players would gain experience and more importantly be exposed to different strategies, different training techniques and different styles of play.

The youth league set-up needs to be revamped and to be fair the FA seems to be working on it.  But its hard to imagine that some of the top young talent in England wouldn't benefit from going abroad to play rather than rot on the bench for one of the larger sides.  

I'm not saying send the kids off to play for Barca but its hard to imagine that some of the higher quality youth couldn't cut it to start in a league like the Eredivisie for one of the mid table squads, same could be said for La Liga, Bundesliga or Ligue 1. A young English player may not be able to break into the side for someone like United but they could probably a pull a regular shift for Rennes, Celta Vigo or Stuttgart. 

If you build the ""best league in the world"" the English players are always ultimately going to want to return to the league to play, for the competition, the exposure, the money or the fact that they would be playing at home. In the mean time it makes sense to take advantage of the fact that there are other leagues with different training techniques, philosophies and mentalities to help prepare your young players not only to play in the PL but to face these differing philosophies for the national team.",0,1396973866,null,0,false,0,cgn8w83,t3_22itj4,t1_cgn8w83,t1_cgn7qam,null,1433264482,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; The most likely result is corporation tax increasing and companies then compensating by reducing wages making it pretty neutral from their point of view and for employees as well.

Problem is that a lot of the companies who employ a large number of people, are in the high volume, low margins business.  These people don't pay much in the way of corporation tax anyway, as they don't declare big profits in relation to each employee.  A quick glance at say Tesco P&amp;L will show how their payroll pales compared to other costs.

So I doubt it would begin to be funded by a rise in corporation tax.  It also wouldn't make sense too, as ultimately it's people receiving it, so what would happen is that those earning above say £10k, would suddenly find themselves taxed more.

It would be fascinating to see if people did stop working.  I mean some jobs are probably only able to get away with paying so little because there is no real alternative for those people.  As some suggest that elements of the population currently can't be bothered to work, I wonder how that number would change.  Obviously, if the income was £30k, I doubt many would bother to work.  What about if it was £10k?

But there would be a strange effect on inelastic supplies, they would probably go up in price in a little bit too.  So you'd probably find out that everyone earning above the threshold, but below a certain high amount would be much worse off.

Meanwhile, certain jobs would probably change a bit.  How many people work because of necessity, rather than need?  I plan to quit what I'm doing by the time I'm 35, baring having children.  I just can't face it for the rest of my life.  If I had paid my mortgage, I could probably have quite a nice life on the citizens income, add in a lodger and it's really stress free.",0,1396976440,null,0,false,0,cgna7qq,t3_22it1f,t1_cgna7qq,t1_cgn89zx,null,1433265101,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

* results hinge upon their decisions

* they don't have the benefit of replay, slow-motion, or alternate angles (aside from their assistants but even they are limited)

* not to mention they receive death threats from complete looneys for simply doing their jobs

I understand the FA wanting to protect their officials - though I think it's a bit ridiculous managers can't voice their opinions at all regarding the officiating - because could you imagine if enough referees said ""enough is enough"" and went on strike or altogether quit?

* I miss a road network that isn't full of potholes, blind curves, adverse cambers and populated by overloaded poorly maintained trucks (no rail network here) driven for hours by drivers high on coke, along with lunatic motorboys and perfectly nice people who turn into utter fucking arseholes behind the wheel - they all think that they're Ayrton Senna.

* I miss people not assuming I'm from the USA because I speak with a gringo accent

* I miss good whiskey at affordable prices

* I miss cheap air fares to other countries.

* I miss affordable skiing holidays.

Wow, what a rant this has turned into. It's time I stopped.

The idea that basic/guaranteed/citizens income would cause inflation is, from every article I've read, debatable. There is no way to be sure what would happen, because it's not just about giving people an extra £7k, basic income would change how we live our lives and have a huge impact far beyond the amount in our bank accounts. Basic income would change education, employment, it would change the way we live our lives, suggesting that basic income would cause inflation and be worthless in 2 years is just as silly as stating it wouldn't. Nobody knows what would happen, because there has yet to be a large scale experiment, all of the experiments so far have been small scale in poor places[1] -- although they've been really great successes, but that's not relevant to the question of inflation. 

Scepticism is certainly welcome and needed but writing this idea off because *obviously it would cause inflation and be worthless* is crazy. We **do not know** what would happen.

[1] I did read about an experiment done in the 70s in a US town that was apparently a huge success but due to some political bullshit it was abandoned and the study never completed, but if I'm remembering rightly it was said to be a huge success and something that, if pursued, could have had a profound long term impact.

When we played City at the Etihad, they'd free scored against every other team that had been there, Arsenal included (6-3).  We almost beat them but it ended up being 2-1.  We had a great game, but got unlucky with a key decision putting Sterling in an offside position.  Throughout the game it was 50/50 possession wise, and we actually had more shots than City and the same number of shots on target.

We can beat city.  We score an average of 3.1 goals per game at home.  They have a strong team, yes, but they've also got all the pressure.

Nobody is expecting us to pull this out of the bag.  Many people want us to, don't get me wrong, but not everyone is expecting it.  Man City have the resources behind their team, and they have that expectation which comes with an investment of such proportions...

Yeah I was thinking that too but there's always the chance that the there could be 4 dubious decisions in the game.
And you obviously couldn't give unlimited challenges or you'd have players challenging calls far too often.

I think how it's done in rugby would be fairest. It's shown on the big screen but the ref doesn't have any say in the matter so can't be influenced. I think a good ref wouldn't allow himself to be influenced by the crowd but it's always a possibility. The decision goes to the Television Match Official (TOM) instead of the ref. He's always seated seperate from the crowd with a tv and gets to see multiple replays of the incident from different angles.

However, if the TMO method is seen as not fitting for whatever reason then maybe the challenge bit where as long as a challenge is called within say 2 or 3 seconds of the incident then the incident would be reviewed next time play stops. That way people wouldn't be able to disrupt an attack on purpose.

I was thinking about this before, I wonder when we could have the tech to basically 3D map the players and then make offside calls via a program (I would guess it would work similar to on FIFA?). With all the 3D scanning shit thats going on now, I don't see that while expensive its not implausible. 

I totally agree that offside calls is next. We need to take baby steps first before thinking about reviews!

He went to parry it with his left hand instead of his right and Lavezzi scored on his near post as well. Wasn't completely his fault but he could have saved that one.

&gt; The second was more on Luiz than anyone 

Again, bullshit. Where was Cech? Trying to punch the ball with 20 guys in front of him. Corners are where goalkeepers need to communicate with their defence so its not as simple as saying ""defence should have done better"".

&gt; And the third goal, everyone wants to blame him because it was near post...let's just ignore the fact Pastore dribbled around a third of our team in our penalty area and was allowed a free rip from the edge of the 6 yard box?

Doesn't change the fact that he should've saved that.

Also, there have been so many other instances in the league where he was poor. Benteke's goal on his near post is one off the top of my head. Here are some stats:

Champions League 2013/14

I'm really not sure. It's so hard for me to decide.

Right now anyone who has a ticket is probably going to do their best to get themselves there, especially for the City and Chelsea matches, and the tickets become far more valuable for corporate shmoozing as well.

I have 2 degrees and work full time.
The hard work isn't the bit that's lacking!

Sure, but all the time you spend working in IT and working in theatre is time you're *not* spending trying to get a job in film or TV. The 19 year old on the dole has the freedom to take a meeting with a production company on a Wednesday afternoon and can potentially turn out at least one short film a week if they put their mind to it.

If you're interested in working in TV production, focus on getting a job in that. If you're interested in being a playwright focus on that instead but don't expect someone to give you a job in the former just because you've got experience in the latter.

&gt;I should have applied for that script-reader role on NI Screen, but it asked for TV experience. Probably would have had a chance.

If you aren't even applying for the jobs that *are* actually advertised...

Nothing about your scenario is specific to NI as far as I can tell and my original point was that the industry here is doing, in my *exact words* ""not too badly"". 

The fact that one of the **world's** most popular TV dramas is made here surely qualifies as ""not too bad"" but here's a list of other programmes made here recently, literally just off the top off my head, no Google:

Line of Duty, 
The Fall, 
Wipers Times, 
Blandings, 
6Degrees, 
Scup,

Points of View, 
Sketchy, 
School Run, 
The Afternoon Show, 
True North, 
Dig World War 2 with Dan Snow.

And that doesn't even include any of the feature films (Hunger, Starred Up etc...) If that doesn't count as ""not too badly"" for a tiny country of 1.8 million people who sometimes bring their capital city to a standstill over ridiculous bullshit like a flag and occasionally try to blow each other up then I think your standards might be too high.

true,DaveMcElfatrick,,Coleraine,"&gt;Do you think that underpriveleged urban African Americans should WORK TOWARDS GETTING SOME QUALIFICATIONS?

I think your suggestion here is loaded with inference, but I'm not sure what the alternative to this would really be for anyone. Should a group not try to gain qualifications because they're not as immediately fortunate? 

 There seems to be confusion here between a lack of privilege and a lack of engagement with the tools that are given to you. Every secondary school in the north provides the toolset to gain the entry-level qualifications needed to work. The real question is, why are these children not passing them? What outside influences are there that are making this engagement seem less important? Is it a recurring loop of a lack of employment opportunities in the market contributing to a lack of confidence in gaining work, seeing no point in trying?


Purely anecdotal  here, but the guys I went to school with who are now jobless seemed to be more interested in playing football than learning anything. I'm not saying 'try harder to get a job', I'm saying those lack of qualifications provides another barrier when looking for one in an already difficult time for employment. I'm basing my assumption on the figures published recently. I genuinely think there is a culture of disengagement with the education system in some areas.

true,maybelying,null,null,"There are some aspects of Who lore that should be left untouched by the writers to avoid diluting the nature of the Doctor's story.

The Time Lords are the oldest race in the Universe with power and technology beyond comprehension.   Their culture and their society should be left to our imagination, because any attempt to portray it will be lacking.  As well, a large part of the Doctor's mystique comes from the fact that there is so much we don't understand or know about his background.

My biggest fear is that the writers are going to want to delve into Gallifrey, and I think that will be a mistake.  As it was, Gallifrey's portrayal in DotD was lack lustre at best.  As with the classic series each time they featured it, it winds up being just another planet like any other planet.  

TotD, on the other hand, I felt handled Gallifrey better.  The crack, the signal, the intrigue.  You know they're there but you don't really know what's what.

The Time Lords can't be reduced to just another alien of the week.  Doing so greatly diminishes the character of the Doctor.  The Time Lords need to remain mysterious if the Doctor is going to remain enigmatic.

My hunch is that Moffat will likely not want to delve too deeply into Gallifrey probably for similar reasons.  He has always wanted the Doctor portrayed as unique, and needs to be careful about letting people see too much of what's behind the curtain.

The racist bit is the false pretences the posters were put up under. It's nothing about tax, wages or even jobs. How would the people putting the posters up know what the foreign workers are paying in tax? How would they know what they are getting paid? Do they get a sneak peak at their payslips or something? You really think a business is going to pay more for a worker from abroad when they can get the same skill locally? You fire those 300 foreign workers, you really think locals will be beating down the door and training up in the skills needed to replace them? 

The claims are suspect at best, and seem more to create someone to point the blame at so as to play to someone's victim mentality. (For what end, who knows. UKIP votes maybe)

If this group have evidence of what they claim, by all means, let us all see it. Show us an example of a foreign worker paid by H&amp;W with no tax on that payslip.

I think just telling people to get qualifications isn't really helpful or realistic for any socially deprived group as the issues run much deeper.

Psychological and educational research points to intervention at a very early age ie &lt;5. Sadly it seems that a lot of the damage is done by the time the person reaches secondary school or is anywhere near having the capacity to make decisions about and form attitudes toward education. Anecdotally, I think the catholic school system has much better provision of nursery school places. 

As for privilege, I think it's more subtle and wide ranging than just being given a certain opportunity at a certain time. I think it includes things like supportive and encouraging family/social relationships. Poor educational and vocational outcomes tend to be associated with social deprivation and a negative cycle which is often handed down from generation to generation. I think tackling these kinds of issues is what's really needed, rather than blame and ridicule.

true,DaveMcElfatrick,,Coleraine,"&gt; Poor educational and vocational outcomes tend to be associated with social deprivation and a negative cycle which is often handed down from generation to generation. I think tackling these kinds of issues is what's really needed, rather than blame and ridicule.

I completely agree that this is how it works, however to me it still stands that this culture of disengagement needs to be heavily addressed. Where does the issue begin? In a loop where social deprivation is only deepened by a lack of engagement, where do you believe we should start? How can we encourage investment in areas where a potential workforce are less interested in gaining the basic skills required of them?

I can't speak for LAD personally, as I'm not heavily involved with them but I agree with a lot of what they say and do. I understand there's varying opinions on them.

Then there is also the fact those chips also could probably work as a gps as well. Put 4 gps scanners on each corner of the pitch and have it take a snapshot every time the ball is kicked. The ref can have the feature added to his watch, this will show what the number of the players who were offside. When a dubious call is made or the ref/linesman is unsure check the watch and bam you have your answer.

The other advantage is that it eliminates at a single stroke the problem of limited incentive to work - if the payment is fixed regardless of your income then there's *always* an incentive there to find paid work, as you keep 100% of the extra income without losing anything to gradual withdrawal of means-tested benefits.

If memory serves, when your income is in that fuzzy area where you're still eligible for various forms of assistance but the amount you're eligible for is being reduced, it amounts to something like a 70% marginal tax rate - every extra pound earned only actually adding 30p to your net income.

true,o0Johnny0o,,Belfast,"I think what he's trying to suggest is that GAA tops hold the same amount of political implication that a Rangers or Celtic top does but not the neutrality of a hockey or rugby shirt. Which I think is a fair point; rightly or wrongly people make those assumptions.  If the university already has a precedent, why is it an exception?

For arguments sake, let's assume that GAA tops do display a political stance.

Personally I'm split on the idea of banning tops.

On the one hand it suggests, rather patronisingly, that their student body isn't intelligent enough to see someone's 'stance' disagree, and get on with their lives. They make the assumption that seeing politically aligned images (be it a GAA top, Rangers jersey or Che Guevara t-shirt) might upset someone and they shouldn't have to deal with it. 

But all three of these examples are accepted political messages. If people have the choice to wear these tops, all parties learn something about the big ugly world; there are appropriate times and ways to display, confront, support, ignore etc etc ideas. There'll be people who you'll get on well with that don't share your opinion on an issue or, worse, there'll be horrible people that agree wholeheartedly with you.

By restricting expression, however small, you rob all the opportunities that come with learning about expression.  It's a University campus for crying out loud: let there be as much expression there as possible. The extreme result of expression is that distasteful attitudes pop up amongst everything else.

true,leondz,eu,Britain,"Access to a good range of cheeses. The UK has the best access to cheeses in the world - hear me out!

In France, you can get excellent local cheeses, including ones that can't be exported without a lot of trouble (like unpasteurised camembert). In Italy, you can get excellent local cheeses, including many blends of two or even three styles of cheese, and that weird illegal one with live maggots in. In Germany, you can get German cheese, which is nondescript. In the USA, you get that processed muck or the pre-sliced What's-his-name Jack stuff. But these places concentrate mostly on their local cheese, some of them being very proud of it, and only import one or two from abroad - like a bog-standard long life Brie, or some grated parmesan.

In Britain, we have a fantastically broad stock of local cheeses; creamy to sharp cheddars, smoked this and that, stilton blue and white, wensleydale, a bit of yarg, cornish brie; a pretty wide range. But we also get really up into every other country's cheese. Old amsterdammer and Edam, sure; a selection of pecorinos; two bries and a raclette; some wobbly Swiss stuff with holes - we have access to everything. 

Nowhere in the world have I seen such a broad range of global (well, European) cheeses in almost every supermarket as in the UK - everyone else seems just too obsessed with their own stuff, which is often utter muck (looking at you, Denmark, and Norway with your brunost - aka [petrol](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21141244)).",0,1396986249,null,0,false,0,cgnfb2r,t3_22i9iv,t1_cgnfb2r,t3_22i9iv,null,1433267567,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I wanted to chase a girl I liked (success btw),  b.  London was astronomically expensive and I had no disposable income c. It would look good on my cv. 

I have a good job that allowed me to switch from London office to Munich office with no dramas. 

What do I miss... 

1. The food...  English supermarkets are amazing.  German supermarkets are terrible.  You can't get individual packs of crisps,  they don't have many chocolate bars,  there is less variety of foods, the sliced bread is crap...  You can't just go grab a meal deal from Saino's like you would in the UK. 

2. The banter...  You don't realise how unique British banter is...  From the topics to slang...  I often find myself have to simplify my English or topics about stuff in the UK. 

3. The pubs...  So you got biergartens and kellers...  But they close at 11pm... I miss getting kicked out at 1am...

4. cheap electronics...  I know what you're thinking...  Cheap? Internet,  phones and general electronics are cheaper in the UK 

5. TV...  German TV is utter crap.  I have to stream iplayer and my parents sky go to get UK stuff...  Even then it's not all channels and poo quality

The problem is the BTL *industry*. Not the individual BTL landlords, they are just gamblers who have decided to bet everything on a highly geared financial derivative, no different to someone who plays the stock market.

It is the overall industry, the banks who lend to them, that are the problem.

When I had ADSL problems at the last place the typical symptoms were:

* ADSL would gradually lose speed, generally it was the uplink speed that would slowly drop down. e.g. I had 600 and it would drop to 300 and then down to 60 after a while.

* ADSL would drop out for about a 1minute, every 10 minutes. This would go on for a few days then it would go away again for several weeks.

* If I was quick, I could get to the landline and listen for crackling on the line. If there is noise on the line, then that's your smoking gun. Trouble is that by the time a technician gets to your house, the crackling will have probably gone away. :)

Also try power cycling your modem, and lifting the handset up and down a few times. Sometimes opening and closing the connection can fix problems of corrosion on the copper lines. I was told this by a technician.

Poe's law, in broader form, is:

&gt;Without a blatant display of humor, it is impossible to create a parody of extremism or fundamentalism that someone won't mistake for the real thing.

&gt;The core of Poe's law is that a parody of something extreme by nature becomes impossible to differentiate from sincere extremism.

In the match thread, I said I wanted Schurrle to start because he brought a lot offensively and when he came on that’s exactly what he did. It also showed we can rest Hazard occasionally.

Two of the substitutes scored, further proving Mourinho knows exactly what he’s doing.

Everyone doesn't have the same requirements. £7000 p/a for a single 20 something in mid Wales vs £7000 for a single parent in central London is a massive difference. And this is WHY the current system is complicated, there is no single amount which will prevent poverty in the UK.

We do need to do something about the British benefits system; 

* readjust values based on situation, personal circumstances and location
* Stop harping on about people on benefits and how they're draining the system while politicians invest in private companies while syphoning taxpayer money out of the country and into those companies to pay for essential services
* Stop demonising people who are living off benefits whether by choice or not. Usually the choice is an easy one given the issue with step 1. Often parents will lose money by going to work compared to benefits which quite rightly support them and their children.
* Stop allowing corporations to ""hire"" people on workfare allowing them to scrimp on fully paid employees.
* Stop allowing corporations to cripple small businesses who do want to grow and hire.
* Form and vote for a political party who knows what it's like to survive, to work from the bottom, to have bad times ending in debt and learning to grow as individuals into successful politicians. Get rid of inherited money and privilege from the people who make decisions on behalf of the rest of us. I will vote for success there's nothing wrong with that, but I will not vote for fake inherited money and Eton bum chums standing in parliament like some kind of lads holiday taking photos of themselves evicting the disabled and laughing at the poor like some kind of country sized circus just to say they were there. 

Big business supports this country, we can't deny it, but so do the people who work and live around it, and so do the consumers. I'm sick and tired of seeing valid human beings kicked out of society just because they are too poor to contribute to that system.
