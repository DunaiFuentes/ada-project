Quantum physics needed to understand this: Double-slit experiment.

Short simplified rundown: you shoot a beam of light at a shield with two slits in it. A photon (light particle) can only go through one slit at a time, right? Imagine throwing a baseball at a wall with two holes. How many holes can it go through?

So strangely behind the shield you can see an interference pattern. This is something you would see if you had water streaming through the slits. But it would only show if it were coming through both slits at the same time. Like a vortex and stuff.

Now for the interesting part: as long as no one is watching you can assume the light to go through both slits. At the same time. Counterintuitive? Yes. Logical? No. Welcome to quantum physics.

As soon as you were to watch an individual photon, you could clearly see it go through one single slit.

So in short: as soon as anyone watches, all possibilities are reduced to exactly one. 

Now back to doctor who. As soon as someone looks at an angel it takes exactly one of its possible forms. Which is stone. So the angel stays there, it just is stone.

&gt;

&gt;__Soft power__ is a concept developed by [Joseph Nye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Nye) of [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University) to describe the ability to attract and co-opt rather than coerce, use force or give money as a means of [persuasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persuasion). In recent days the term has also been used in changing and influencing social and public opinion through relatively less transparent channels and lobbying through powerful political and non-political organizations.

&gt;Nye coined the term in a 1990 book, *Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of American Power*. He further developed the concept in his 2004 book, *Soft Power: The Means to Success in World Politics*. The term is now widely used in international affairs by analysts and statesmen. For example, in 2007, [CPC General Secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPC_General_Secretary) [Hu Jintao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu_Jintao) told the 17th Communist Party Congress that China needed to increase its soft power, and the [US Secretary of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Secretary_of_Defense) [Robert Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gates) spoke of the need to enhance American soft power by ""a dramatic increase in spending on the civilian instruments of national security – [diplomacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy), strategic communications, foreign assistance, civic action and economic reconstruction and development.""

&gt;According to the 2013 Monocle Soft Power Survey, [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) currently holds the top spot in soft power.  The top ten is completed by the [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK), the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan), [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden), [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia), [Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada) and [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy).

Last season, especially towards the end, we relied heavily on Hazard to create chances. Oscar was out of form, Ramires doesn't posses the ability to make good passes and Matic is on the other side of the pitch and usually more defence oriented. In such situations I find it a bit selfish to just ask others to create chances for you when you should be the provider given the role you play.

&gt;Let's just forget for a moment that this new power is supposed to be about 'naughty' people who don't pay their taxes, and consider what's really being proposed - or rather, actually happening.
Your bank enters into contract with you to act as holder of your wealth, that is, monies or financial instruments that you own and hold via trust in contract with another private party. That relationship is fully defined in the contract, with rights and legally enforceable responsibilities - on both sides. This is common law, in its purest sense, that Magna Carta condenses into two pages of vellum of inalienable rights (which are, amongst others) - the right of freedom of the person from summary arrest and incarceration and the unalloyed title to legally held property.

&gt;Your relationship with the state or sovereign authority is an entirely separate and blind relationship to any other (or should be) - and it has been for the best part of a thousand years. 
This 'minor' adjustment to tax collecting powers, if left unchallenged, changes all that. 
Private property, indeed the very concept, principle, practice and legal shroud protecting it - goes. 
Private property then becomes merely a gift and whim of the state. This is a very serious thing indeed and underpins our very ability to exist as independent actors, separate from the state.

My suggestion to you is to be very social with your classmates, you'll end up going out on the town and meeting new people. Don't be scared though, it's a fantastic town. 

My top tip however:
- Coffee in England is shit. Buy a coffee machine. Everyone will offer you instant (Lyx) by default unless you go to a cafe in town.

SMALL BATCH COFFEE COMPANY is amazing though. Look out for it.

There are arty type things everywhere, you'll find what you need. It's much cheaper than Sweden too so you'll be pleasantly surprised.

The one thing we do quite badly in England is lunch. English people don't eat a big meal at lunchtime and the lunch places aren't often that great. One place I would recommend though for a ""lunch bufee"" is http://www.foodilic.com/ - there are a couple in town. Very nice.

It's not enough for academics and journalists to write about it. Opposition parties, unions and social charities need to be working to create a ground level movement which will show the level of disagreement with these policies and result in changes in voting behaviour.

Eating out:
I'd also recommend Pinocchios and Donatellos.  Both are cheap and have a nice atmosphere, location and food.  If you're more into veggie stuff, Food for Friends or Terre a Terre are good.  We're not really starved for good places to eat though.

Beer:
Never Carling.  I don't know any good English beers.. I normally go for some Dutch/German lager.  The Evening Star, Basketmakers Arms and The Prince George are all good places if you want some traditional ales.

Avoid:
Avoid West Street, North Street, Queen Road on a night out.  They're all full of clubbers, drunks, police and fights.

Coffee:
Lots of good places.  My favorite is Rock Ola, which has this 50s/60s diner feel.  There's no shortage of choices though.

true,neversayalways,null,null,"It depends on the solicitor, some will push for higher settlements because their fees will be higher that way, or some might just like to push out as many settlements as possible to maximise income that way. Since I left that line of work I know there have been some significant cost reforms, so that could come in to play. What concerns me is that your solicitor doesn't seem to have gone over what value you should be expecting out of this prior to getting in to offers and settlements. Can I ask who your solicitor is? The best thing I can recommend is to do some research on google for a personal injury solicitor who deals specifically with higher-value injury claims. A lot of people end up going with whoever their insurance company refers them to (although they don't call it that now as there are rules stopping insurers getting referral fees from solicitors for doing this, but there's usually a way around this) and you'll often end up with a large national firm who are more interested in bashing out a lot of settlements and you'll typically have a low level paralegal dealing with your case, rather than a qualified solicitor. I am concerned that you don't seem sure if your solicitor will even talk with you about the subject; they should be available for you to call as many times as you like to discuss your case, your ongoing symptoms, whether you might need further treatment/med reports and the value of your injury. That's what they're there for. Look for a solicitor that has good reviews online, that specialise in higher value claims rather than the whiplash 'bread and butter' low value cases, that is geographically closer to you if possible (but not absolutely vital as they should be more than willing to talk in depth on the phone).

We play with three players in midfield and have 5 central midfielders (Gerrard, Henderson, Allen, Can, Lucas), none of which offer the defensive qualities that Lucas does.  I'm not sold on Can yet. He could be good, but as of now he's an unproven quantity. It's one thing to have a YouTube compilation of a player, and it's another to actually perform in a different league at the highest level. Additionally, Gerrard is 34 and won't be able to play every game next year with the additional CL games.  We need Lucas for depth if for nothing else. 

Also should we not show loyalty to Lucas (if he wants to stay)? Loyalty is a double-edged sword. We are often quick to get up in arms about players not showing Liverpool loyalty (e.g. Suarez wanting to leave) but turn a blind eye when the club doesn't show loyalty.

Probably not accurate but a good ballpark figure can be got from Wikipedia regarding the total income generated for 2012.

The total number of income tax paying members was 28,974,000. The average amount paid was £4060, giving us a total of £117,634,440,000.

I think someone needs to drag these events out of the hands/influence of the paramilitaries. Where the councils are providing the 'green' bonfires is a good first step (although people are moaning about the costs, it's a good idea and probably saves money longer term). They should probably become like the Guy Fawkes bonfires in England where the organisers are responsible for the cleanup and conduct.

Personally, I think the Orange Order themselves should consider becoming the stewards and organisers of these bonfires. The incidents happening are making them and the '12th' look bad when they're not actually involved. Burn the premade bonfires (made of woodchips I think) on prepared sites so that no tarmac or surrounding street furniture is damaged. Ensure that no flags emblems etc are burnt. Make them safe enough that families feel safe attending. If they're able to 'clean up' the bonfires it would go a long way to mending bridges with the nationalist community, disproving the 'anti-catholic' label, which can only help when it comes to discussing parading.

I don't think you can point to evidence of a single sinister, ulterior motive behind the government's surveillance policy. Sure, you can point to examples of *individuals* abusing their positions (child porn guy, for example), but it's not like the government's intent for this surveillance was to allow him and others to do that. 

Sure, there's a chance that someone may abuse his power and right now be jacking it to webcam screenshots, but again, that's not indicative of a sinister intent on behalf of the whole government, but rather individual corruption.

At times it seemed as if Benitez was playing him just to annoy everyone, and prove some kind of point. He was that bad.

But he never gave up. Never hid. He adapted his game and improved. He did OK as a holding midfielder. And because of the adversity, because we love a trier, because we had lost Xabi and then Masher and the glory days of coming second and twatting REAL madrid 5-0 in Europe seemed a distant memory, Lucas became the only bright spot in a woefully underperforming team. And a kind of cult hero.

Proving all the naysayers wrong etc.

Well, not really. His best form was never anything special really. Easy to improve upon. His lack of physicality, pace, stature and authority always meant that he could be replaced, and his recent drop in form and chronic lack of pace exacerbated by injury has left him way below the standard we require to challenge for titles.

We've been spoiled over the years with fantatstic midfield players like McMahon, Souness, Gerrard, Xabi, Alonso, Didi, Whelan etc.

#**TRIAL AND ERROR**

*A Special Report by Adam Macqueen*

TWO WEEKS AGO — just hours after the last issue of the Eye went to press — a jury of her peers found Rebekah Brooks not guilty of all charges in her eight-month trial, while deciding that Andy Coulson knew all about the widespread phone-hacking at the News of the World during both their editorships.

As well as declaring that Brooks had no knowledge of her staff hacking phones or paying public officials on the Sun, the jury also unanimously cleared her of charges of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice regarding the removal of seven boxes marked as containing her notebooks from the News International archive a few days after news of her staff hacking Milly Dewier emerged, and the hiding of computer equipment and other material from police searching her Cotswold and London homes.

But during her 13 days in the witness box, Brooks did admit that several specific actions she had taken both as Sun editor and chief executive of News International had been aimed at preventing the full extent of the phone-hacking conspiracy at the News of the World from becoming public — even though, as she insisted, she did not believe at the time that the claims she was trying to cover up were true.",0,1404988306,null,0,false,0,cite5cx,t3_2abg3x,t1_cite5cx,t1_cite58d,null,1434640958,2,false,PrivateEye,t5_2s41e,2

##WHAT REBEKAH DID...

&gt; **Ignored information that others at the News of the World were involved in phone hacking in addition to those originally charged with the offence**

Brooks, then still Rebekah Wade and editing the Sun, testified that although she had discussed the Blunkett story with Coulson before it was published, she was ""absolutely not"" told about its provenance — but she certainly knew from 2000 onwards that evidence existed of a more widespread phone-hacking conspiracy at the News of the World, because the police told her about it.

In September that year — just a month after the arrests of Goodman and Mulcaire — Brooks received a two-hour briefing from police about the investigation, thanks to the fact that her own voicemails had been accessed by Mulcaire. She told the court that she was concerned ""from a corporate view to know where the police were. Journalists are curious creatures by nature. I went in hoping to discoverrhe latest from the horse's mouth.""

Her account of the meeting, which she immediately shared not use with Coulson but with other senior News International executives including Rupert Murdoch, was that police bad details of 100 to 110 victims, but were ""not widening the case to cover other NotW journalists, but would if evidence emerged"". She also passed on the names of a number of other suspected victims, including Tessa Dowell, Hugh Grant, Jemima Khan, ohn Prescott and his mistress Tracey Temple — and Blunkett and Quinn. None of these victims featured in the limited charges to which Goodman and Mulcaire would plead guilty two months later.

Brooks told her colleagues that she believed there was not too much to worry about: although police ""do have GM's phone records which show sequences of contacts with News of the World before and after accesses... obviously they don't have the content of the calls no this is at best circumstantial.""

Brooks — a company woman through and through — declined a request to appear as prosecution witness at Mulcaire's trial, because of ""the complexities that would have caused on a corporate level"". But she did admit under cross-examination that from this point on she was aware that police suspected a criminal conspiracy at the News of the World that went way beyond the ""single rogue reporter"" the company would admit to for the next four and a half years.

Despite this, both then and when she became CEO three years later, Brooks went along with the company lie (shurely ""line""? Ed)that no one other than Clive Goodman at the News of the World had been involved with Mulcaire's hacking. She told the court that despite learning, either through the police meeting or in the course of ""internal investigations"" at the company, that the phone-hacker's employment had begun during her own editorship of the paper, she had not asked any further questions about his activities: ""I thought he had been paid for legitimate private detective work.""

In the witness box she tried to claim that the ""horse's mouth"" evidence she had been offered by police had been superseded by statements made at the subsequent trial that hacking ""had been confined to Clive Goodman and Glenn Mulcaire. I can't remember if the judge said it but I remember it being out them in the public domain that that was the end of it."" The prosecution, however, forced her to admit that she most have known at the time that on the contrary, Mr Justice Gross had pointed out that in several cases the hacker had ""not dealt with Goodman but with others at News International"" and Goodman's own NI-funded lawyer had argued that ""whoever else may be involved at the News of the World, his involvement is as limited.""

Despite all this inside knowledge, Brooks insisted that when she took over as CEO three years later, she had not felt any need to make any further inquiries about the extent of phone hacking on the grounds that ""other people had made statements about it... there wasn't any need to do any mom investigation."" This is extraordinary.

Brooks was appointed CEO in June 2009, although she did not start the job until 1 September. In July, the Guardian had carried accurate details of a wallet-busting secret settlement with victim Gordon Taylor and the fact that phone-hacking victims ran into the thousands, which NI denied in a bullish statement: ""All of these irresponsible and unsubstantiated allegations against the News of the World and its journalists are false.""

The revelations kicked off a further round of police, parliamentary and Press Complaints Commission investigations, with Brooks being invited as CEO-in-waiting to appear in front of the Commons culture select committee ""to resolve inconsistencies in [News International's] evidence"". She declined, leaving NotW editor Cohn Myles and an NI lawyer to face the MPs, who later ruled that they ""deliberately avoided disclosingcrucial information to the committee and, when .ked to do, answered questions falsely"".

The company had at this point for more than a year been in possession not just of an email which made Neville Thurlbeck's involvement in phone hacking clear, but also a legal opinion commissioned from Michael Silverleaf QC which warned that them was ""a powerful case that them is (or w.) a culture of illegal information access"" at the News of the World. All of this information would presumably have been available to Brooks in her new job — it had been made available to her boss, James Murdoch, although he claims not to have read it but the ""curious measure"" apparently did not think to ask.

In the light of the jury's verdicts we can only conclude that as well as being an inept editor who had no idea how her staff were getting their stories, she was a spectacularly negligent CEO as well.

&gt; **Attempted to stop details of a wider phone-hacking conspiracy emerging in public at an employment tribunal in 2007**

On 13 April, not long after Clive Goodman had been released from prison and when she was editing the Sun, Brooks took the disgraced hacker out to lunch to offer him a job. This, Brooks admitted to the court, was a straightforward attempt to prevent Goodman from going through with an embarrassing public employment tribunal at which he was threatening to air the truth about Coulson and ""pretty much everybody who had a senior role"" on the News of the World's involvement in phone hacking. It came after a discussion with an executive at News International who the jury was told knew about Thurlbeck's hacking, at which it was decided that: ""I was the right person to speak to Clive and find a middle way.""

Brooks insisted in the witness box that: ""I don't think anyone, me included, thought the allegations by Clive had any basis"" at the time: but ""there was concern at News International that a line had been drawn under the episode and the company felt that... to go through an embarrassing employment tribunal would lead to a series of damaging headlines.""

Goodman rejected her offer, and instead the company ended up paying him £153,000 to settle his claim and stop the names coming out. Brooks denied being told any details of the settlement, although ""I'm sure my natural curiosity would have made me ask.""

&gt; **Paid to halt legal proceedings that would have revealed the names of other phone-hackers at the News of the World in 2010**

In January 2010, not long after she had been made CEO, Brooks personally negotiated the settlement of a civil action with phone hacking victim Max Clifford in order to prevent Glenn Mulcaire being forced to name staff on the paper who had instructed him to hack phones.

As what she admitted in court was ""a damage limitation"" strategy, Brooks offered to settle with Clifford in return for a £200,000 retainer for which he would ""represent the Sun/do business for the Sun"". She agreed with colleagues that nothing should be put in writing because it ""would look terrible if seen to be 'buying off' Max"". A note of the meeting records that ""she could physically tom up with cash this evening."" A deal was eventually done with Clifford for Elm. In the witness box, Brooks was completely clear about why this happened: ""I accept the motive and objective was to stop Glenn Mulcaire from naming names... It had the potential for financial and reputational damage to the company... The main reason for settling was damage limitation.""

She maintained, however, that she did not know the names he would name would be the right ones: ""Glenn Mulcaire, by anyone's standards, was an unreliable witness."" That did not, however, stop her company from agreeing just months later to indemnify the phone-hacker ""in respect of his legal costs and disbursements for dealing with and defending proceedings in which he and [NI subsidiary] News Group Newspapers [NGN] are joint defendants"", while still publicly claiming that whoever else he might have been hacking phones for, it can't have been anyone at the News of the World. This was covered by a clause stating that ""the fact of NGN providing Glenn with an agreement to meet his legal costs shall not be disclosed to any third party.""",0,1404988344,null,0,1404990611,0,cite5le,t3_2abg3x,t1_cite5le,t1_cite58d,null,1434640954,2,false,PrivateEye,t5_2s41e,2

##THE SECRETS OF COURT 12

***Since the ""Trial of the Century"" kicked off In the dying days of October last year, the Eye has done its best to keep readers abreast of events in Court 12 of the Old Bailey. But there was plenty which went on In the absence of the Jury which could not be reported — until now.***

###THE AFFAIR

ALTHOUGH their lawyers accepted by the opening of the trial that the affair between Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson would become public knowledge, they still vigorously opposed any-mention of it in the prosecution's opening speech. It was not about his client's privacy, declared Brooks's QC Jonathan Laidlaw — ""that is long gone"" — but any publicity was likely to be inaccurate and prejudicial, based on ""an aspect of Mrs Brooks's life, the interest in which may he based on fact or fiction"".

The judge, however, ruled that the affair could and indeed should be brought up in connection with the phone contact between the lovers at the time of the Milly bowler hacking, when Brooks was on holiday with her soon-to-be husband Ross Kemp, and Coulson was back in London putting together the paper as her deputy.

Saunders pointed out that unless he was ""being stupid"", this would actually benefit the defence. providing as it did a different context to their phone calls. If so, it was not one they relied on — both denied that they had been anything other than good friends at that particular time.

The debate in the courtroom was elliptical as every side tried to avoid spelling out what they were actually discussing. The affair was referred to throughout by the rather splendid euphemism ""the sensitive are"".

There was no such coyness the following month, with the existence of the relationship — and the draft letter from a dumped Brooks to Coulson, discovered by police on a seized computer, which revealed it — well and truly out in the open. 21 November saw heated exchanges over whether the letter's full contents should be revealed in court, meaning the press — those awful nosy journalists again! — would be allowed to quote it.

Brooks — never viewed as much of a stylist in her tabloid-writing days — had by now mutated into a modern-day Virginia Woolf. ""The letteris a stream of consciousness, written late at night, intended for no one,"" frothed Laidlaw. It was ""wholly misleading"" to judge it on the few paragraphs quoted by the prosecution out of context — but to give the full context would be equally unacceptable, because it would be a gross invasion of privacy. Not that of Brooks and Coulson — Laidlaw had the grace to admit that ""having held others to account she could not possibly complain about publicity of this sort"" — but on Coulson's wife and children.

Just in case you — like the judge — were in danger of thinking this sounded rather reasonable, Coulson's counsel earned up an astonishingly brass-necked precedent. In a session during one of the jury's days off on 6 December, he cited the case of ETK versus News Group Newspapers, the injunction (see Eyes passim) brought by an actor who embarked on an affair with a co-star who was sacked after they split up. The court of appeal ruled in 2011 that the danger of his teenage children being bullied if the affair was revealed meant that it must remain secret forever. And which was the devilish newspaper which was proposing to expose the extra-marital shenanigans in the public interest? *The News of the World*!

Ruling that the jury should be allowed to reed the full text of the letter privately, and its contents thereby remain secret, the judge managed to note a certain irony. ""There will he some, particularly those who consider that their own family life and theft children's family life were affected by stories in the News of the World or the Sun, who take the view that it would only be just for the same to happen to the Coulson,"" he wrote in his ruling. ""While making no finding about what the One or the News of the World may have done in the past, I am under a legal obligation to take into account the effect on the family life of the children and what may have been done to others is not relevant to that issue.""

The mystery deepened further when, a full five months after the legal team for Brooks (who was, as the judge noted, ""in a great deal of distress"") had been arguing that the affair had not continued for anything like the six-year period implied by the 2004 letter, Coulson admitted in the witness box that it had been more like nine, and the pair were still bumping uglies on occasion right up to the time he resigned in 2007.

###THE JURY

THE defence teams spent the best part of two days sifting through questionnaires filled out by potential jurors to establish any objectionable qualities they might possess.

One admitted to ""following Lily Allen"" — on Twitter, one presumes — another to an intriguing ""knowledge of Paul McCartney"". At first the defence demanded that anyone who had ever been a member of any trade union be excluded because of their presumed bias against Rupert Murdoch over the Wapping dispute 30 years previously. This was eventually whittled down to exclude members of the relevant print unions, with one of the potential jurors getting a free peas after remembering at the last minute that he had been paying SOGAT dues for the relevant period.

All police officers and their relatives were rejected, and any connection to the hated Guardian was a no-no — one of the defence teams even opposed the selection of one juror who had a friend who had worked for the paper in the past, which caused the judge to raise his eyebrows so far they nearly disappeared under his wig.

As the clerk of the court called up the nine women and three men randomly selected from shuffled cards, Rebekah Brooks could be seen in the dock carefully noting down their details. That journalistic twining — it just never leaves you.

###THE MORON

ANOTHER topic of much discussion in the early stages of the trial was: what to do about Piers Morgan?

One witness, Ambi Sitham, was due to appear for the prosecution to testify that she had heard Moron and Rebekah Brooks, then editors of the Mirror and Sun respectively, joking about phone hacking at Andy Coulson's birthday peaty a decade ago. Brooks's team claimed it would be unfair for the prosecution not to call Moron and ask him about it. However, they were not willing to call Moron as a witness themselves. Why not? Let's let the judge answer that:

""*So what are the reasons the defence do not wish to call Mr Morgan? Mr Laidlaw tells me there are two: first because Mr Morgan engenders contrasting polarised reactions in people. Some people's reactions are very favourable to him and others are very hostile. The defence are concerned that if some of the jury have a hostile reaction to him, that will reflect on Rebekah Brooks and will colour their view of her. Mr Laidlaw accepted that this was not the strongest of reasons and the answer to it is that the jury will decide the case on the evidence, not on any pre-conceived view of Mr Morgan. The real reason for the reluctance to call him was concern at what might emerge if the prosecution were allowed to cross examine him. The fear was rot in relation to what were on at this party, but on other matters*"".

As the judge noted, the prosecution had reason to ""take the view that Mr Morgan may not be a reliable witness"": his evidence to the Leveson Inquiry, which ""it is fair to say... was not accepted by the inquiry without qualification."" He declined to order Moron to appear before the court, which meant that any evidence he might have to offer on phone-hacking has gone, like his show on CNN, unseen.",0,1404988396,null,0,1404990647,0,cite5x4,t3_2abg3x,t1_cite5x4,t1_cite58d,null,1434640960,3,false,PrivateEye,t5_2s41e,3

##THE REACTION

***As news of the verdicts filtered through kern the Old Bailey, various Interested parties were quick to give their take on events.***

###THE SUN

""THE Rebekah Brooks verdict is a triumph for British justice and two fingers to the baying mob,"" opined the Sun the morning after its former editor was cleared of all charges.

""The CPS and police now have obvious questions to answer over the weakness of much of their case after such a long and costly trial... How can we afford to keep blowing millions on high-profile trials destined to fail?""

It is a fair enough question from the person who has so far blown by far the most millions — Rupert Murdoch's bills are currently running at roughly ten times the cost to the public purse, with News Corp reporting more than £270m in legal costs arising from phone hacking so far. But the Sun has another reason for trumpeting the clearing of Brooks so loudly.

One of the lower-profile charges on which she was found not guilty ws conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office — in plain English, agreeing to pay public officials — while she was editing the Sun. The failure to get a conviction makes it possible that cases against the vast phalanx of Sun hacks arrested for the same offence (and, to be fair, one or two from other papers as well) will not be brought to trial at all.

The need to establish a precedent also explains the CPS's determination to stage a retrial of Andy Coulson and Clive Goodman after the jury failed to reach a verdict on the same charge against them at the News of the World.

###THE EX-HOME SECRETARY

FIRST out of the traps to comment on the verdict, thanks to a pre-recorded interview with BBC News, was former Labour cabinet minister David Blunkett.

He told the BBC that having his messages to Kimberly Quinn intercepted by the News of the World forced him ""as close as anyone could ever come to having a breakdown without actually having one... People have said to me 'why aren't you bitter?' The reason is you can't send bitterness like an email. It erodes you from inside. And the only way of dealing with this then and now was to pick yourself up and get on with life.""

And that, lest we forget, is exactly what he did: agreeing, on the very day in 2005 that he resigned from cabinet in disgrace for the second time in a year, to an offer from his close friend Rebekah Brooks to take a job as a columnist on the Sun on an annual fee of £150,000.

When her successor Dominic Mohan declined to continue with his services, Blunkett was instead 'contracted as an adviser to News International on ""corporate and social responsibility (volunteering and education)"", a position in which he remained until June last year, just before the phone hacking trial began, trousering nearly £100,000 a year on top of his MP's salary. All this in addition to the dames. paid ""to close members of my family in July 2011"" which resulted from the hacking of his associates' mailboxes (it was made clear in court that Blunkett's own phone was never hacked).

At the time that particular settlement emerged, Blunkett was far less eager to air his views in the media, telling the Observer that any questions about the settlement ""constitute harassment"" and were ""blinding hypocrisy"". Which is, of course, nothing like the behaviour of the man heard in court 
on recordings of voicemails from 2005 berating the ""hyenas"" and ""bastards"" of the press, and hoping they would ""rot in hell""!

###THE WOLFMAN

PERHAPS the most ubiquitous figure in the media in the days following the verdicts was former tabloid top dog Neil Wallis, who has very effectively established himself in the public eye as the face of honourable and innocent tabloid journalism.

He popped up on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Radio 4's Today and The Media Show, the BBC News Channel and even the Question Owe panel to hammer home his view, endlessly reiterated on his Twitter account, that the entire trial had been a disastrous waste of time and money. As he contemptuously told one media outlet: ""This has been a state show trial. The intention of that has been to emasculate, to attempt to emasculate the very lively, very combative media in this country""

Wallis describes himself as a ""survivor of Operation Weeting"", having been arrested on suspicion of phone backing in 2011, told he would not face charges but then questioned again under caution by police last October. He was Andy Coulson's deputy during the whole time he edited the News of the World. He remained with the paper as executive editor until 2009, before famously going to work for the Metropolitan Police.

##FIVE IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANDY COULSON AND REBEKAH BROOKS

1. Rupert Murdoch was considerably fonder of one than the other. In July 2011, on the day the final edition of the News of the World was published, Murdoch famously pointed at Rebekah Brooks when asked what his first priority was and said: ""This one"". And Torn Watson MP, a fierce Investigator of phone hacking, claims that the month before that he was approached by ""two Intermediaries close to News International"" who offered to do e deal: the company would ""give him' Coulson but Brooks was ""sacred"".

2. Brooks was still at News International at the point in early 2011 when the company began cooperating with the police and handing over evidence of wrongdoing, whereas Coulson was long gone.

3. Rupert Murdoch has always been happy to pay Brookse legal bills, whereas Coulson had to take his former boss to the appeal court in order to force him to honour his contractual obligation to pay his.

4. Brooks merely wrote to David Cameron in October 2009 to say that ""professionally we are definitely in this together"", whereas Coulson actually was.

5. Andy Coulson is guilty of conspiring to hack phones, whereas Rebekah Brooks is Innocent of everything.",0,1404988460,null,0,1404990726,0,cite6cx,t3_2abg3x,t1_cite6cx,t1_cite58d,null,1434640968,2,false,PrivateEye,t5_2s41e,2

true,theHM,null,null,"&gt; **Allowed her company to deny accurate claims about the wider extent of phone-hacking in the New York Times in September 2010**

In September 2010, the American paper printed a lengthy in which revealed that Andy Coulson openly discussed and ""actively encouraged"" phone hacking as editor, and that feature writer Dan Evans had been suspended from frontline duties for trying to intercept designer Kelly Hoppen's voicemails in June 2009. A spokesperson for the NotW denounced these as ""unsubstantiated allegations... we reject absolutely any suggestion there was a widespread culture of wrongdoing at the *News of the World*.""

Brooks — that spokesperson's boss — admitted in court that ""there was a Dan Evans situation that [NNW editor) Colin Myler brought to my attention"" by that point, but she remembered very few details of it and still believed that no one on the paper other than Goodman had been involved with phone hacking. Having been assured that Evans ""denied any wrongdoing whatsoever"", she still felt no need to investigate the matter further.

&gt; **Tipped off Andy Coulson that incriminating evidence was emerging**

Brooks told the court that black and white evidence of a wider phone hacking conspiracy at the News of the World emerged at the very beginning of January 2011 as part of the ongoing disclosure process the company was involved in as a result of civil actions against the paper.

The company suspended the journalist who was implicated and put out a statement that was not intended to be ironic — ""The News of the World has a zero tolerance approach to wrongdoing""—but the evidence was not passed on to police until 25 January, resulting in the launch of Operation Weeting the following day. In the meantime, on 14 January, Brooks had a ""discreet"" meeting with the prime minister's official spokesman at a hotel in Victoria. She told the court that ""I was going to tell Andy that we'd found some pretty incriminating evidence"" and that he should think about resigning from Downing Street, which he did on 21 January.

&gt; **Oversaw the destruction of the News International email archive for the period crimes were being committed**

In January 2010 — a 'few months after Rebekah Brooks had become CEO — News International launched a new official policy ""to eliminate in a consistent manner across NI (subject to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements as to retention) emails that could be unhelpful in the context of future litigation in which an NI company is a defendant.""

It was at first proposed that all emails dating from before December 2007, the year Andy Coulson left the News of the World, should be permanently deleted; but the court heard that in June Brooks changed this deadline to I January 2010. ""How come we haven't done the email deletion policy discussed and approved a months ago?"" she demanded in an internal document shown to the jury. When the new date was queried by a colleague who pointed out that ""The revised date is likely to be misconstrued if circulated externally"", Brooks replied ""Yes to 2010. Clean sweep.""

A 9 September memo from the IT department notes that ""there is a senior NI management requirement to delete this data as quickly as possible"", while Brooks personally chased up progress once again on 7 October. Brooks told the court this was simply because a mass of old emails stored on company servers were slowing computers down or causing them to freeze, and that NI ""wanted to design a completely new system and come bang up to date"".

She insisted that the policy had been carried out ""in conjunction with lawyers and they were absolutely aware of what needed to he kept""; but the court heard that more than lam emails have been lost forever, including all but a few thousand emails sent before 2008, which covers the period that, in prosecutor Andrew Edis's unimprovable words, the News of the World was functioning as a ""thoroughly criminal enterprise"". At the trial, Coulson's lawyer tried to use the absence of most of his client's old emails in his defence, suggesting that the ""gaps in evidence"" meant it would not be safe to convict him.

&gt; **Failed to account for the whereabouts of a number of her own email devices**

Brooks testified that when she served as News International's chief executive, ""the level of paranoia was quite high, myself included, about privacy and security"". She had her offices, home and car regularly swept for bugs. But she was unable to explain the whereabouts of a number of missing devices she used to access her smalls, a medium which she said she used ""more than usual"", regularly putting information in writing and sending it even to colleagues who were in the same room as her.

Brooks admitted discarding BlackBerrys at surprisingly regular intervals — ""Maybe four or five times a year... They broke, or a new model came out, or I spilt something on it, the usual wear and tear if yell have it with you using it all the time"" — but was unable to account for whet had become of many of them. While most people have drawers or boxes in the attic stuffed with old mobile phones held on to ""just in case"", not so the Brooks family — when police searched their country home after Rebekah's arrest, they did not find a single electronic device, although a number of computers were removed from their London flat. An HTC mobile phone, three BlackBerrys and at least one iPhane, all apparently used at the Cotswolds property during 2010-11, remain unaccounted for.

One of the missing BlackBerrys was a model which Brooks was advised to stop using by NI security in January 2011 because she feared it might be being accessed by enemies of the company. By a startling coincidence which the judge ruled the jury could not be made aware of, that particular machine was dumped and replaced by an identical model on the very day that NI handed over new evidence of phone-hacking which prompted the Met to launch Operation Weeting.

Another BlackBerry that has never been found — again swapped for an identical model — was discarded on 2 June that same year, at around the same time the hard drive of Brooks's old office computer disappeared from the records at NI, presumed destroyed.

The explanation Brooks's defence team offered for the un-traceability of these devices was the inefficiency of record-keeping in the IT department at News International: ""We didn't particularly have a formal system as such."" Staff were, however, efficient enough to attach an NI label to one of the computers which Brooks's husband Charlie admitted hiding from police when their homes in the Cotswolds and London were searched.

&gt; **Admitted that as an editor she paid public officials, one of the charges she was cleared of**

""We have paid the police for information in the past,"" admitted Brooks, then News of the World editor, to the culture select committee in March 2003 — an answer that was swiftly clarified to: ""We operate within the code and within the law and if there is a clear public interest then we will.""

Last month Brooks was cleared of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office while editing the Sun — this time involving an MoD official — while the jury failed to come to a verdict on a similar charge against Coulson at the News of the World. But parliamentary privilege — an issue which Mr Justice Saunders described as ""incredibly complicated"" — meant that neither this, our any other evidence given by Brooks, Coulson, any of their colleagues or either of the Murdochs to select committees over the years could he presented to the jury.",0,1404988529,null,0,false,0,cite6ts,t3_2abg3x,t1_cite6ts,t1_cite5le,null,1434640988,1,false,PrivateEye,t5_2s41e,1

true,theHM,null,null,"###THE EYE

""NOBODY is keener than Mrs Brooks to have this case tried,"" claimed Rebekah Brooks's QC Jonathan Laidlaw way back on 29 October. But just minutes previously he had been overruled in the latest of a series of attempts to ensure the trial did not happen at all.

Laidlaw and his team had applied to stay the trial before it even started, on the grounds that ""the vast amount of deeply prejudicial material"" which bad been published about his client by those nasty newspapers made it impossible for justice to be done. ""Attempts to somehow return her to a position where she can be tried fairly are beyond what this court can do,"" he intoned sorrowfully. ""It would be humanly impossible to do so.""

As further evidence of beastly press treatment he cited that very morning's Private Eye, which featured Rebekah Brooks on its cover with a joke about her wearing a Halloween witch outfit. ""It is a quite deliberate attempt by Private Eye to destroy any vestige that remains of Mrs Brooks's attempt to secure a fair trial... A blatant attempt to scupper proceedings,"" he spluttered, rattling out flattering claims about the Eye's circulation and influence. ""It is not just a matt. of those who subscribe or read the magazine — everyone who wallas into a newsagent will see what is in effect a campaign against her.""

How very different from the professional life of our own dear ex-News of the World and Sun editor, ran the unspoken thought around the courtroom. But Laidlaw was not finished: with the support of Andy Coulson's legal team, he submitted an application to the judge that if the trial could not be thrown out completely, it should be delayed for at least a fortnight and the entire squad of potential jurors — the lucky 12 had not been sworn in yet — discharged and replaced with a fresh team whose eyes could not be sullied by our cover.

There followed an awkward hour or so during which copies of the magazine were passed around its perhaps least appreciative ever readers — though it was noticeable that Charlie Brooks stashed one in his briefcase to read later (or maybe he just wanted to leave it behind some bins).

Coulson's barest., Timothy Langdale QC, remembered rather belatedly that if he was claiming the magazine was extremely prejudicial it might be an idea not to leave his own copy face-up in the middle of the courtroom where the jury would all be able to see it Finally Mr Justice Saunders returned with his view: although he was ""concerned about the material"" and ""took the matter extremely seriously"", be himself would do nothing more than show the magazine to the jury and warn members they must ignore it He was far more concemed about some much more prejudicial pamphlets a nutter outside was handing to any passer-by who looked like a juror, but no one was allowed to report that until now.

Any further action was up to the attorney-general — who announced at 5.30 that afternoon that ""proceedings for a potential contempt of court aren't required."" It was left to Laidlaw — whose discovery of copies on sale outside Farringdon station had kicked off that morning's investigation by som over-keen policemen and a minor media storm — to wail impotently: ""Is anyone, anywhere going to do anything about Private Eye?""",0,1404988553,null,0,false,0,cite6zy,t3_2abg3x,t1_cite6zy,t1_cite5x4,null,1434640983,2,false,PrivateEye,t5_2s41e,2

Get over yourself. Football is a business that makes billions of pounds every year, and get this, so is the club! You don't think £50m for a defender, let alone David Luiz isn't good business? Then thank fuck you're not managing the club. 

When I saw your post I thought you sounded like a Football Manager fan, always wanting to give the youth a chance, but perhaps not since you seem to not realise that in this game, money counts for a lot, which is something every Chelsea fan should realise. I mean come on, Roman rescued the club with his billions, so don't make out like business doesn't come into this, because it does.

&gt;If you can't buy a player that's better than the one you're selling then don't sell the player.

What are you referring to here? Luiz? He wasn't even first choice CB, Cahill and Terry were. If PSG want to spunk £50m on our second choice CB, let them. It allows us to give a chance to the likes of Kalas and Zouma.

Cycling *could* be an entirely valid form of transport for a large amount of people, if more were done to encourage people to take it up.

&gt;__Operation Urgent Fury__ was a 1983 [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States)–led [invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion) of [Grenada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada), a [Caribbean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean) [island nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_nation) with a population of about 91,000 located 100 miles (160 km) north of [Venezuela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela), that resulted in a U.S. victory within a matter of weeks. Triggered by a bloody [military coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_coup) that had ousted a four-year revolutionary government, the invasion resulted in a restoration of [constitutional government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_government). Media outside the U.S. covered the invasion with a negative outlook despite Soviet and Cuban presence on the island and the presence of American medical students at the True Blue Medical Facility.

The coalition cuts to public services are ideological, in the same vein.  Why should people get more out of something than they put in?  Why should I pay all this tax when I don't use the NHS, and all those Northerners who smoke and eat pies are the ones we spend all the money on?  More importantly, how much *money* could we make out of all this?

We *could* pay for the NHS to surge forward and become the best healthcare system in the world if we closed tax loopholes and made certain tax avoiding big business and the wealthy pay their fair share. 

Instead, we allowed a party which was elected with insufficient mandate, who promised to ""keep the NHS safe"", sweep in and begin its ideologically motivated non-manifesto privatisation agenda, saying we ""can't afford the NHS"" whilst allowing countless billions in tax to slip away with its back turned.

So basically we currently have the worst of both worlds, they're illegal, so you can't control them, and spending more time on education is counter intuitive, but also its not really enforced, so there is no reason why the average person who is interested in seeing what its like won't try them, the law is not a deterrent.

Poor people aren't poor because they are inferior, they are poor either because they lack the ability to become rich (through intelligence, disability, etc.) or they lack the incentive to become rich (effort v reward, opportunity, etc.). If they lack the ability, provide a safety net. If they lack the incentive, provide market conditions that enable the incentive.

Businesses as entities exist for shareholder and investor returns and whatever means get them to that end. Part of that end is to make yourself as tax efficient as possible or you won't get the investment. For a startup this means seeing what help you can get with your tax bill such as the EIS scheme or VAT exemption. If you are entitled to this and you aren't taking it up then you are just wasting shareholders money and you won't get investment. 

Unfortunately morality in the sense of taxation has to come from governments..which is a bit worrying for us at the moment. All ""tax planning"" initiatives have to be registered with HMRC before they are operated and if they are legal then the idea is for HMRC to be able to close the loophole at the next opportunity if possible. 

Probably a bit much for this thread but being able to close a lot of these tax loopholes in a globalised world will require cooperation from every government on the planet.

Again, the medical is fact, not rumour. To me it's quite clear we did it before the World Cup to tie him into a deal, otherwise it would make no sense at all to bring him in before the World Cup and before the fee had been agreed when he was in a worse medical state than he was after the World Cup.

How is it fantasy to believe that? It's logical and besides deadline day  most players usually do get announced days(sometimes longer) after they've officially signed. Especially when you've only got a short holiday because of the World Cup, you don't want to ruin that by travelling around making announcements.

Israel is by no means a beacon of a society the rest of the world should try to emulate but they show an utterly ridiculous level of restraint in terms of how they respond to terrorist attacks to the point that their over-emphasis on humanitarianism is at least partially responsible for the attacks against them. 

One can't help but wonder if such attacks would continue if just once Israel actually did enact a disproportionate response.

Carroll is at his best when the balls arriving at his head and he can either knock it down to someone else or head it at goal. Anytime the ball is actually at his feet, he just doesn't look that comfortable, and he'll look to pass the ball back to a midfielder rather than flick it on or thread a ball through for a winger.

Bony would much rather receive the ball to his feet, and is always looking to play the ball round the corner or pass it on towards his wingers. He's also pretty good in the air for finishing crosses.

As you say, I think we're likely to play 4-3-3 next season with one main striker and two wingers/wide forwards.

It's a shame how this government has completely neglected the mentally ill - the way they have been treat makes it seem like the government would rather them just end up on the street and die of starvation. Which means you're going to end up with more people who are a danger to themselves and others around them in the public when they should be getting cared for in a hospital. 

I just find it hard to ever blame the 'attacker' in cases like this without knowing everything. Just for example my mum is quite severely bipolar, and she has been let down again and again by the NHS. I used to think the NHS was brilliant until I had to start dealing with my mum's illness. Just most recently she was particularly bad and I convinced her to admit herself into hospital without me having to get her sectioned (which I've had to do before and is a horrific thing to have to do, especially when I was 19 and just a uni student). When she admitted herself they had no beds in the whole of the county, so just put her in A&amp;E. After 24 hours they released her and just basically let her get on with it because there were no free beds in Oxfordshire. Absolutely ridiculous - how exactly would people react if this happened to.... I don't know a sufferer of cancer or something? Say it that case, and I hate to even think about it, my mum were to do something like happened here, she would probably still get all the blame, which would of course be wrong imo when she tried to seek help and admit herself. And the problem is, even when you're in hospital, I've seen it with my own eyes, the doctors and nurses often treat the patients appallingly and often don't help them at all. Of course I don't want to group them together as some are brilliant, but often they're very patronising and don't treat them with any respect which just makes them worse.

true,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"&gt; The trouble is when you make it harder to be poor, but there are no jobs to go to, or those that do pay less than a life on benefits.

But that is only one side of the conservative view. The other side is about enabling opportunity via grammar schools, meritocratic systems, increasing jobs and growth and suchlike whilst reducing the perverse incentives to live a life on benefits, inflation, etc. 

&gt; many poor people are poor because they come from generations of impoverishment, decaying postindustrial areas or lack the education and motivation to go for the good jobs. 

To the Tories the phrase ""I was the first one in my family to go to university"" is the barometer of success in addressing such issues. Getting rid of cultures of dependency is what the Tories are even now trying to do. You can disagree with how Michael Gove is attempting to improve the life chances of youngsters, for example, but you can't disagree with his conviction about the fact that he is trying to change the system to the way he sees it best preventing school leavers from having no hope or prospects. 

In other words, the Tories don't hate the poor or want to punish them for being poor. They want the poor to work hard and to gain sufficient rewards from that hard work that they remain incentivised to continue doing so, instead of being lazy and being just about comfortably enough off that the cost of working hard is outweighed by the benefits of not doing so. They certainly have a long way to go in terms of creating the market conditions for ongoing job stability and growth but things are moving in the right direction and the hope and expectation are that they will continue to do so.

&gt; The class system also comes into it. It's trivial to get rich if you know all the right people by virtue of circumstances.

Knowing the right people is no guarantee of success, even if it does improve the chances. Getting to know the right people is equally not a guarantee of success, but is something poor people wanting to become rich can work toward. Keeping top-rate taxes low helps entrepreneurs and small businesses, many of whom are working class people who started their own businesses. Class may come into things but there are still plenty of upper class poor and aspirational working classes who are driven.",1,1404994794,null,0,false,0,citfjc4,t3_2ab0n6,t1_citfjc4,t1_citf3st,null,1434641867,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

They didn't, that's the problem.   MPs avoided giving themselves appropriate 'front end' pay rises for decades because it's never popular.   It lead to rules on expenses being taking loosely (mostly enabling non-rich MPs to ""just do their jobs"" but in other cases often abused all over the place).

When the responsibility was handed over to an independent committee, the committee promptly pointed out the standard wage was way behind equivalent responsibility in the market place and was a deterrence to would-be MPs who weren't millionaires.   And so proposed the fix with the worst possible political timing (as if to emphasise they're independent....)

The fix involves both an increase to front end pay **and** a tightening of expenses and pension contributions.   It's overall effect isn't to raise MPs overall income by 11%, it's somewhat less than that but I don't know the exact percentage.   The effect was to move their income from the rather murky expenses + benefits world into a much clearer standard pay packet.   It's not an 11% raise....

Bony would mean that we'll be playing with 2 upfront, Coutinho/Sterling behind the strikers, Lallana/Hendo/Allen/Gerrard for CM and Lucas/Can for CDM.

Dear XX,

I urge you to oppose the new legislation on emergency phone and internet data laws. As I'm sure you're aware, this is being rushed through within a week in response to the European Court of Justice striking down a similar EU directive due to privacy concerns.

If you are unsure what I am referring to, the BBC report is here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28237111

The new laws being voted on are far from transparent and there is not an open debate taking place to discuss their merit. This leads me, and many of my peers, to concern that short term security and the interests of a minority are being prioritised over the long term security and civil liberties of the people in this country. We believe there is significant danger of this irreversibly damaging the UK's integrity and principles of fairness and democracy.

If you disagree in any way I would be very keen to hear your response. If not, please vote against this and urge your colleagues to do the same. We cannot allow this to happen.

Sorry, but you should have no expectation that your 8th century ideology will be given respect.  Tolerated?  Yes.  Respected?  No.

Discrimination against individual Muslims on account of their religion is wrong, but Muslims (or any other religious group) do not have a right to have their *beliefs* shielded from criticism or ridicule and I wish more religious people would understand this.

Edit:  I'm asked whether I 'feel the need to constantly ridicule people'.  Well, I think that *ideas* should be held up to scrutiny, criticism and ridicule and that religious ideas have no exemption from that process.  People understand it's necessary to criticize capitalism, socialism, Marxism, libertarianism etc., so why should religion be any different?  No, I don't think you should accost Muslims on the street and start arguing with them, but according to the quote, this person got upset because he/she heard someone say that they don't believe in religion!  That's not harassment, that's someone being offended at any challenge to their beliefs about the world.

Edit II:  Just received this tweet from Ex Muslims forum:

&gt;the Guardian deleted our comment here http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/09/what-is-it-like-to-be-a-muslim-in-britain-today … because ""it didn't abide by our community standards"" pic.twitter.com/3PTX9R1wcB

the comment being:

Dear XX,

I urge you to oppose the new legislation on emergency phone and internet data laws. As I'm sure you're aware, this is being rushed through within a week in response to the European Court of Justice striking down a similar EU directive due to privacy concerns.

If you are unsure what I am referring to, the BBC report is here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28237111

The new laws being voted on are far from transparent and there is not an open debate taking place to discuss their merit. This leads me, and many of my peers, to concern that short term security and the interests of a minority are being prioritised over the long term security and civil liberties of the people in this country. We believe there is significant danger of this irreversibly damaging the UK's integrity and principles of fairness and democracy.

If you disagree in any way I would be very keen to hear your response. If not, please vote against this and urge your colleagues to do the same. We cannot allow this to happen.

Technically not. The CJEU [ruled the Data Retention Directive invalid](http://www.bailii.org/eu/cases/EUECJ/2014/C29312.html) on the grounds that, among other things, it was too broad and didn't have sufficient safeguards. The UK Government's position seems to be that their implementation of the DRD, the Data Retention Regulations, add in those safeguards, and that their new version will be narrower.

The [Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-data-retention-and-investigatory-powers-bill) will pass. There are a couple of interesting problems with it (such as the potential to put foreign ISPs in the position of being forced to obey UK law or their own domestic law), but it isn't likely to fail.

What will be important will be to prevent this upcoming review from recommending that the next Government reintroduce the Communications Data Bill that was blocked last year. I imagine the current Government's plan is for the review to recommend that, and there will be a lot of pressure on it to do so. Further, it is important to be ready for the debate - both publicly and in Parliament - in November/December 2016 over the replacement law.

Steve Baker: Are Liverpool looking at any options for a new right back given Johnson's form last season ?

I'm not aware of them looking for a right-back at this stage. Left-back was pinpointed as a priority back in May and they are still seeking to get that sorted having been unable to agree a fee with Sevilla for Alberto Moreno.

I actually thought Johnson would be sold this summer considering that he's down to the last year of his contract.

I didn't think Liverpool would want to risk losing him on a free transfer in 2015. However, at this stage it seems that the club are prepared to keep him.

Johnson was offered a new deal towards the end of last season but on significantly reduced terms that the £110,000 plus per week he's currently on. He rejected that and the club have no plans to make him a better offer.

Maybe being down to the final year of his deal and knowing he's playing for his future will energise Johnson.

Maybe Gallagher and Targett in for Lambert/Shaw, then if Lovren isn't there (which I have no idea about) we might just have Hooiveld/Yoshida with Fonte, or even better - Chambers at CB and Clyne still at RB.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day

&gt; The eight-hour day movement or 40-hour week movement, also known as the short-time movement, had its origins in the Industrial Revolution in Britain, where industrial production in large factories transformed working life. The use of child labour was common. The working day could range from 10 to 16 hours for six days a week.[1][2]
&gt; 
&gt; **Robert Owen had raised the demand for a ten-hour day in 1810, and instituted it in his socialist enterprise at New Lanark. By 1817 he had formulated the goal of the eight-hour day and coined the slogan: ""Eight hours labour, Eight hours recreation, Eight hours rest"".** Women and children in England were granted the ten-hour day in 1847. French workers won the 12-hour day after the February revolution of 1848.[citation needed] A shorter working day and improved working conditions were part of the general protests and agitation for Chartist reforms and the early organization of trade unions.
&gt; 
&gt; **Karl Marx considered working hours to be of vital importance to the workers health, saying in Das Kapital ""By extending the working day, therefore, capitalist production...not only produces a deterioration of human labour power by robbing it of its normal moral and physical conditions of development and activity, but also produces the premature exhaustion and death of this labour power itself.""[3][4]**
&gt; 
&gt; The International Workingmen's Association took up the demand for an eight-hour day at its convention in Geneva in August 1866, declaring The legal limitation of the working day is a preliminary condition without which all further attempts at improvements and emancipation of the working class must prove abortive, and The Congress proposes eight hours as the legal limit of the working day.
&gt; 
&gt; Although there were initial successes in achieving an eight-hour day in New Zealand and by the Australian labour movement for skilled workers in the 1840s and 1850s, most employed people had to wait to the early and mid twentieth century for the condition to be widely achieved through the industrialized world through legislative action.

The package's length plus two times the diameter must not exceed 1040mm (1.04 metres) nor must the total length be more than 900mm (90 cm) - which for posters shouldn't be a problem unless they're huge.

If the package is less than 100g, then it's £3.20 to Europe, £3.80 to Zone 1 (everywhere else except Australia/NZ) or £4 to Zone 2 (Oz/NZ)

Then the price goes up based on weight and zone:

Up to 250g £3.70 / £4.75 / £5.05

Up to 500g £5.15 / £7.45 / £7.90

Up to 750g £6.60 / £10.15 / £10.75

Up to 1kg £8.05 / £12.85 / £13.60

We aren't going to sign a Suarez replacement, at the end of the day it's a win that matters. We let in a hell of a lot of goals last season, and lost someone who banged an unreal number of goals for us. I'm happy to spend money on lots of less extravagant signings, if they fit the mold for our team. We're using the money carefully so far to add pace, dribbling, passing and backtracking prowess that went missing after Henderson's send off against City. The tail end of the season should be enough to prove to some of you that the power striker means nothing without lots of help.
Bony won't fill Suarez's boots but he will have a more creative team around him than Luis did, and with any luck a bolstered defense. I love you guys, you're all my brothers, but trust Brendan and co know what they are doing.

One positive is when he goes forward he gets in good positions and scores a few goals. You can definitely tell he's a center-half shunned out right. Azpi on the other hand is strong in defense(not as strong as Iva) but also strong going forward(was less apparent last season due to being right footed and playing on the left) and can cross a ball which will come in handy with Costa in the box.

It's tough though because Iva is a typical player Jose would like in the defense whilst Azpi is the typical hard-working player he likes in the squad all together but I can't see him starting both and spending £20m on a 28(will be 29 before the season starts) year old.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Whilst I agree that there should be large parts of the law rolled back, let's get serious for a moment.  The current 'law' doesn't work with the UK's obligations to the Human Right's act (the right to privacy), so something needs to be done.  Leaving the law as is will just mean that the communications companies will still have to collect the data, but maybe breaking your privacy to do so.  Given that by collecting the data they will be breaking their obligation to you (and will be liable) and by not collecting they will be breaking their obligation to government (and be liable), something needs to change.

Because of the time since the previous version we can't roll back to the previous version and we don't want to rush something through (our democratically elected parliament) now that is permanent, so this bill is only in place until 2016, where it has to be replaced (that is written in the bill). In the bill there are a number of measures to have consultation on what it should be replaced with in 2016.

My advice is to accept this as a not-great-but-the-best-of-a-bad-bunch stop gap and then work to make your feelings heard for the new proposal in 2016.

* If you don't want this far reaching power for the government, then the options that you have are to write to your MP to tell them what you specifically don't want in the bill when they revise it in 2016.  
* You should also request to your MP that they inform you when the consultation on RIPA is going to be held, so that you can include your comments on it.  
* Finally you should request from your MP a way that they can make you aware of the transparency reports that are going to be produced so that you can see the impact of this bill.

[Here is the bill](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/328939/draft-drip-bill.pdf).  Read it before you start sending out emails and letters to MPs.

Never mind that Jews have been mercilessly persecuted for centuries wherever they have lived, and that following WW2, there were many countries in the west, the UK included, who wanted as little to do with Jewish displaced persons as possible.

[Mostly this article](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/28/britain-plutocrats-landed-gentry-shotgun-owners) is what fuelled my intense dislike for him.

I have just noticed he's in favour of nuclear power, so I suppose he's not *all* bad. Overall I think a lot of his ideals are pretty admirable, but he just promotes them in such a self-righteous way that I can't help but be annoyed by him.

Edit: Although I disagree with most of that article, he's entitled to his views about the cost of licencing etc. What really got me going was the fact he thinks gun ownership and shooting sports are the sole preserve of the rich, and the fact he referred to legal, licensed gun owners as ""dangerous lunatics.""

Joking aside, I'll respond to this point first:

&gt; When, and it is when not if, a bomb goes off and people are killed and we find out it could have been prevented by monitoring their correspondence, how are you going to feel?

I'd say a huge proportion, if not all, of premeditated attacks and crimes could be prevented through utter absolute data monitoring and retention. If mail delivery services were to check every single letter and package, if ISPs intercepted every single communication and web request, if every phonecall was intercepted and listened to, if every Skype conversation and webcam image was captured. This is not the basis of a democratic society - if any society - and it's certainly not attainable, moral, ethical, justifiable and has no basis for implementation. Ever. 

&gt; What hurts more lack or privacy or losing a loved one or your own life?

I'll leave you with this quote:

""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."" - Benjamin Franklin.

We do not live in a world of absolutes, nor do we live in a world where much is ideal. There will always be those seeking to deceive, harm and take from others, and there will always be immeasurably more people to defend against those actions.

Governments of the world are struggling to draw the line at Liberty Vs Security. Technological advancements have meant that criminals now have an advantage, but Governments also have the means to implement wider tracking of a huge proportion of the world easier than ever before.

We, as humans, have a right to live within the confines of the law, freely. If I have not broken the law, nor have shown any signs of intending to do so, why should reams of my personal information be swept up under the guise of security? What if, in the near future, I were to string two buzzwords together that set off an alarm somewhere, and suddenly I'm the target of a surveillance program? What if I were to express a dissenting opinion against a politician one day and that opinion gathers traction? Should the police or the Government have the ability or the right to look through my phone records and expose me of an affair, or my secret affliction for midget porn in an attempt to discredit me?

The shocking, frightening thing is, both of these scenarios have happened, and will happen. People have been caught up in tremendously ridiculous situations for words or slight actions, and people have been beaten into submission and discredited for their opinions.

A lot of allied nations were less than welcoming to large quantities of Jewish immigrants, and whilst a good deal did move away, the majority felt pretty lost. I agree that it's messed up to move people out of their land and give it to a people who haven't lived there for millennia, but personally I don't know what else could've been done.

We can trace this change in reporting roughly back to the end of the Occupy protests, which had followed two years of anti austerity demos and riots.

Dear Andrew Bridgen,

Not long ago, the European Court of Justice struck down an EU Data Retention directive that formed the basis of English law which madated Internet Service Providers (ISP) to retain information about what web
sites we all visit, what we write by email to whom and when we use the internet.

The ISPs are continuing to collect this information, though the underlying EU directive has fallen as it breached the human rights enshrined in treaties Britain has signed. With fear that the continued collection of this data will get challenged in court, the government is now attempting to rush through emergency  legislation that mandates ISPs to continue the very practice that was struck down as a breach of our human right to privacy.

Now, it is no secret that your party is no fan of the European Court of Justice nor the European Union as a whole. Be that as it may, a court whose authority we recognize has struck down legislation as a breach of
our human rights - this ought to cause enough pause to at least stop this urgent rush to form new legislation without significant time for debate, both in the House of Commons as well as the population as a
whole. Why must this legislation be rushed through? 

One cannot, of course, answer this question without considering what the data collection aims to prevent; namely further atrocities in the name of some higher cause. No one can argue with the desire to minimize
harm to others. But the current powers are simply not proportional with the risks we face. 1700 people, give or take, die each year on our roads, in horrible accidents. Roughly 500 are murdered by people not
claiming authority from a higher cause. In all, about 17000 people die from non-natural causes each year. In contrast, 5 people die from terrorism each year. This is more or less the same amount as perish
from bee stings each year, David Anderson QC found, when he last reviewed terror legislation.

It is not appropriate to say that the number of terror related deaths in Britain is so low exactly because we attempt to prevent it with draconian legislation – we also attempt to minimize road deaths, deaths
from falling, murders and deaths from bee stings. Yet, we don’t require tracking of all vehicles, mandatory breathalysers to start a car, prevent builders from working above 1st floor or outlaw the production
of honey. We act proportionally.

Now we find ourselves here again, with the spectre of terror held in front of us, rushing legislation to carry on the breach of privacy of millions of innocent people who want nothing more than to buy a new
pair of shoes, shop for groceries or look at holiday options. “If you have nothing to fear, you have nothing to hide”, goes the usual argument for these things. Yet, we put our letters in envelopes, we
lock the door to our WCs and we draw the curtains at night. The vast majority of people who commit such acts wish for nothing more than the right to carry on their lives without constant inspection by others.

All your negative assumptions are based on something that has not happened, nor do we have any evidence that it will happen. The threats to our society have happened and will happen again. 

In your calculations you are overlooking the cost of a terrorist attack on a nation, 9/11 crushed the US's economy, stock markets fell hugely, the FED cut interests rates to counter a financial crisis. We are not the US, a similar or even smaller scale attack on the right place could crush our economy.


&gt;The shocking, frightening thing is, both of these scenarios have happened, and will happen. People have been caught up in tremendously ridiculous situations for words or slight actions, and people have been beaten into submission and discredited for their opinions.

If you really want to do so, you can look back little bit further and you will notice this exact same thing has happened to Irish communities. If I recall correctly, those poor areas I've mentioned earlier have had larger Irish population in back then, and there was issues surrounding Irish communities which were mostly same as current issues surrounding Muslim communities.

However, I also think that the union leaders and workers who struggled to win the rights would be appalled at the way unions are run now and were run in the past 30 years.

I was a union member for 10 years in the '80's and '90's. They did nothing to deserve my subs.

As a manager and director I have direct experience of :

* The most effective shop steward I've ever known being deselected for being ""too close to management"" when in fact he was a great negotiator. As a management team we were happy to have his useless replacement in place.

* A union rep asking ""OK but what about a pay rise for the rest of the lads"" after we'd just made 20 of his paying members redundant.

* A union rep asking us to change the redundancy selection criteria so that Polish workers were laid off instead of English workers.

* A rep stealing parts from the factory to use in his own sideline business.

It's a small sample but I don't think the people who so effectively fought for workers rights would have made these choices.

Unions are an important part of the employment landscape and I fully support them.

this just screams ""slut shaming"" - it's only a few steps from this to ""well you were wearing a short dress, you were pretty much asking to be raped so it's your fault"". I hope that's not something you believe, but the attitude in general is very cohesive to that mentality and really, it's just a watered down version.

Again with the assumption that girls dress purely for your viewing pleasure. We really don't.

&gt;Look at guys trying to pick up girls, they enjoy the chase. Once the chase stops, they lose interest.

Please just stop. For one thing you've just completely objectified two whole genders in one sentence (quite impressive, in a desperately upsetting sort of way), assuming that men only want sex and women are just sex objects, which is just not true. Secondly, if the end goal is clearly defined between two partners as ""one night stand"" then it's not ""losing interest"", it's more like coming to the end of an agreement.

Your argument is that wider data retention and surveillance automatically leads to prevention of crime and terrorism. I'm sorry to break it to you, but it doesn't.

&gt; In your calculations you are overlooking the cost of a terrorist attack on a nation, 9/11 crushed the US's economy, stock markets fell hugely, the FED cut interests rates to counter a financial crisis. We are not the US, a similar or even smaller scale attack on the right place could crush our economy.

My calculations? Did I miss something? Again, this argument is completely defunct. Let me use your 9/11 argument as an example.

What you're saying, effectively, is that if there was wider monitoring of phone metadata, 9/11 would have been foiled. If the NSA had picked up on the fact that al-Mihdhar was calling the Yemeni safe house from inside the United States, they may have been able to alert the FBI and to swoop in on those involved State side.

Wrong.

Two years before 9/11, the CIA knew Al Qaeda was in the U.S. ***TWO YEARS***.

Peter Bergen, a 9/11 scholar, puts it incredibly well in [this article](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/12/30/opinion/bergen-nsa-surveillance-september-11/):

&gt; But is it really the case that the U.S. intelligence community didn't have the dots in the lead up to 9/11? Hardly. In fact, the intelligence community provided repeated strategic warning in the summer of 9/11 that al Qaeda was planning a large-scale attacks on American interests.

&amp;

&gt; All of these serious terrorism cases argue not for the gathering of ever vaster troves of information but simply for a better understanding of the information the government has already collected and that are derived from conventional law enforcement and intelligence methods.

The intelligence community is *very good* at at monitoring actual suspects based on previous intelligence. What they are *not so good at* is joining the dots and reading the warning signs. Mass surveillance is a by-product of a combination of laziness, ineptitude and incompetence. They figure that by simply collecting everything they have a wider chance of having a successful hit rate, regardless of the amount of mistakes that may also happen.

I don't want blanket surveillance. I want the intelligence communities and the various anti-terror and law enforcement agencies to be better at sharing their data and suspects, and widening their strengths there. If a fucking terrorist cell has snuck into the country, they will leave a trail somewhere. That trail can be followed with current investigative powers, but they just need to shape up. This is immeasurably harder to do than just monitoring everything and hoping for pings.

&gt; Source for this please?

The one notable example of tracking is that Reddit user who was put under surveillance for a Reddit comment or something of that ilk. I can't remember the whole story, but here's a link: http://www.wired.com/2010/10/fbi-tracking-device/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed:%2520wired27b%2520(Blog%2520-%252027B%2520Stroke%25206%2520(Threat%2520Level))

Lets examine - a 16GB iphone. To access it wirelessly you would need to first either a) spoof a data carrier and somehow ask the phone to send its entire contents via 3g or 4g or even gprs/edge. Not only would that take more than a few minutes, your phone simply cant give out that information to your carrier network. Theres no way o2 or EE or whoever can send a signal to do that, and therefore a spoof network cant do it either. Never mind the fact it would be pretty fucking obvious that everyone in range of their spoof signal cant use their phones on the fake network.

Scenario b - you somehow force a connection to your surveillance wifi or bluetooth. Well you will never connect via wifi automatically to an unknown network, and theres nothing a 3rd party can do to make you. So thats out. Bluetooth requires an active peering with user intervention to connect, so thats out too. So how are they connecting to your device, magic? Or evil Illuminati hidden technology? /s

So your metadata could be chock full of apparent dodgy images that are just named that way for a joke by the web dev.  It's time to unplug your internet connections.  Or wipe and start again. 

By wipe I mean literally that.  Change your ISP today.  Get new email addresses and cease to use all your old ones, delete your facebook account, Google + account and any Hotmail and Yahoo accounts you may have.  Take all your old computer hardware, SD cards, phones, tablets etc to the local skip and watch them get crushed  before your very eyes.  Get a new computer, put a password on your internet connection so nobody can use the computer to access the web without entering the password first.  From now on your internet is ONLY used to access email - no web browser should even be installed.  Also, only official letters and documents should be typed on it, if you want to write about thoughts you have to use a pen and paper.  Children should be banned outright from using any computers (kids are the worst culprits for accessing pornography and non mainstream political websites).  Do not let your kids anywhere near the internet in your home.  Let them use their friends houses and the school networks to access all the porn and dodgy stuff they like, but not in your house they don't!

Sadly big C conservatism and small C conservatism are not the same thing. A negative income tax or basic income are being toyed around with in policy circles but as of yet are not deemed sufficiently politically palatable for the Conservatives or Labour. It may be that the Lib Dem's, Greens or UKIP will be first to grasp the nettle on this issue and once that has happened we may well see something similar being proposed by a potential government at some point.

true,winter_mute,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt;The loophole is that we tax on profit and them a company pays a charge to the parent for use of the name or such. Therefore, they earn no profit in the UK. They still pay taxes, but it just at the lower rate of where the parent is based. 

You tell me I don't understand the problem, then go on to outline my argument for me.  That they ""earn no profit in the UK"" is a technicality, the one I take a dislike to. That profit *is* earned in the UK whether tax law says it is or not.  You don't need to up your tax rates, you just need to fix the glitch in the legislation.  Rather than attempt to fix this glitch, HMRC would rather expend time and resources on legislation to get into our bank accounts. 

Again, it comes down to priorites, and how the wealthy and powerful have different ones to the rest of us.

RB: Paulo Ferreira - The man, myth and legend. Dependable, hardworking, and brilliant player who gave his all for the team. Worked hard, even after being replaced, and became a figurehead for the youth teamers.

CB: Frank Le Bouef - A gentle giant, who took offense to the nature of language use in the stands. Perhaps overshadowed by his French defensive partner, a brilliant player for the club.

LB: Steve Clarke - Player of the year, quality coach, and all round good egg. The guy brought a huge amount to the team, both as a player and as a non-player.

RM: Jesper Gronkjaer - Hands down, the most important player In the club's history. Vicious down the wing, and scored the goal that saved the club.

CM: Frank Lampard - Because what Chelsea team would be complete without him?

CM:  Dennis Wise - Captain extraordinaire. Tenacious, firey, and unintimidated by anyone. 

CM: Roberto Di Matteo - A hero on the field, and on the bench. Career ruined by a horrific double leg break, he will always be remembered for that goal against Boro, and for that night in Munich.

LM: Damien Duff - Often, people talk about Robben and forget the contribution of the Irishman. Quick, consistent,  reliable, and a constant danger.

ST: Didier Drogba - That night in Munich alone justifies his inclusion.

ST: Gianfranco Zola - Model professional, and a true gent. Technically superb, brought a new dynamic to the club, and was everything a top player should be, right to the end.

The Poor Law that underpins the workhouse was introduced to *force* serfdom. Following the black death the lack of labour resulted in mass migration as the previously valueless poor suddenly realised they could get better deals from other feudal lords elsewhere (as some fiefs were hit much harder than others and offered much better terms to attract workers).   
Obviously the barons didn't like this and thus the Poor Law was born to force the serfs to serve their original masters and not move around.

This is my vague understanding of the legislation, although my understanding is probably both simplified and flawed to some extent.

Dear David Gauke,

As I'm sure you know, your government has decided to rush through data retention legislation.                                                          
                                                                                
I don't agree with the substance of the laws at all.  It is an unwarranted and possibly illegal assault on our privacy.  But even if you ignore that, there is no need to rush this legislation through without proper process and full debate.  The cynical sunset after the next election is no help either.

The draft bill is especially dangerous because it appears (clause (2)) to allow the Secretary of State to make up further regulations as he wishes.

So I trust that you will do the right thing and vote against this cynical attempt to force through unpopular and unnecessary legislation.         

Yours sincerely

true,Sbtu,null,null,"&gt;&gt; However, marriage equality isn’t simply a political message, it’s about human rights and equality.

&gt; Not biased at all then, eh!

Virtually nobody in this country seriously argues that marriage isn't a human right or that people of different sexual orientations don't have a right to be treated equally under the law (look at the UDHR or the ECHR, or the statements by various major religious groups).  That's why the arguments against same-sex marriage are generally so contrived and awkward: most of the people making them have to explain why they support rights to marriage and equality, but not marriage equality.  Anyway, this blog post is putting forward a point of view - where did you get the impression it was aiming to be ""unbiased""?

&gt; And it didn't take long before they trotted out the old 'would you serve a black guy' and the 'interracial marriage' argument.

You didn't say what you think is wrong with that analogy.  It's highly relevant, given that the same laws deal with these situations.  If your cake policy singled out interracial marriages (which, everyone seems to forget, most people in this country were opposed to until around the 70s/80s), there would be a strong argument that you were illegally discriminating on the basis of race - in this case, there is a strong argument that the bakery are illegally discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation (and political opinion, which is also a protected characteristic under Northern Ireland equality law).

&gt; The fact is, the store should be able to refuse to write ANY message that they don't want to write, for ANY reason they want. Nobody has a right to have anything they want written on a cake. 

No, there isn't a ""right to have anything you want written on a piece of cake"".  There also isn't a ""right to open a business selling personalised cakes to the public and decide which orders to accept in any manner you choose"".  This isn't about rights, it's about groups of people being systematically discriminated against, and the laws we have to deal with it.  In my experience, most people seem to support anti-discrimination laws in principle but hate it whenever they are actually enforced.

&gt; For example, maybe I want 'SHIT FUCK CUNT PISS TWAT' written on a cake. Surely the store can refuse to do that? Or maybe I want a swastika on a cake. Or a drawing of Muhammad. Or a drawing of a dog, and the owner is a cat person who really fucking hates dogs.

You don't think it's fair to compare a ""support same-sex marriage"" slogan to a ""support interracial marriage"" slogan, but you do think it's fair to compare it to a series of swear words or a picture of a dog?  How old are you anyway?

&gt; That was a load of shite.

If you want, you can find (or work out) a monthly rate of interest. There was inflation of -0.1% from April to May 2014.

Only one of our signings so far is a definite improvement on our starting 11 and that is Lallana, Lambert won't start, Can won't start, Origi will be going on loan, Markovic may or may not start depending on Sterling's form and we are losing Suarez the best striker in the world which is inevitable.


Sky reported this earlier too:

&gt;We are hearing Liverpool are stepping up their interest in Swansea striker Wilfried Bony. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers is keen to add to his attacking options with Luis Suarez on the verge of a move to Barcelona and Bony is thought to figure highly on Rodgers' wanted list. Liverpool are believed to have sounded out Bony's agents about a possible move to Anfield with a number of other Premier League clubs also monitoring the Ivory Coast star's situation at Swansea.

Also, a player is and should be judged on their last performance now what they've done in past seasons. This season Tim Howard, This World Cup, Tim Howard, is a top 5. ",0,1405009719,null,0,false,0,citlwsi,t3_29lrpb,t1_citlwsi,t1_cim5zc0,null,1434645991,0,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,0

So that is 50 hours, they get 13 weeks holiday so 52 - 13 = 39. therefore 50 * 39 = 1950. So an average job is 48 weeks if you take away the 4 weeks holiday. so 1950 / 48 = 40.625 hours a week. Average full time job is 37 hours.

As you can see this is just time spent in school. If you start including stuff done at home, during the holidays etc. that number is only going to get higher.

You also seem to forget that teaching is possible one if not the most important job, they are responsible for the education of the future generations. Without them you get no doctors, nurses, firemen, plumbers, builders, etc.

This strike happen for plenty of good reasons, performance related pay is broken in the way it is implemented I know a fair few teachers that think the idea is good, but the execution is shocking.

As my member of parliament, you are voted for the people to represent those people.  Surely you can see that no-one, except a small minority, want these laws passed, especially with a government that the country is struggling to trust at the best of times.  This should not be an issue that you have to vote for on party lines, but one that potentially more than any other this parliament is one that you must vote for with a clear conscience.

If I leave this house today I am 7 times more likely to be killed or injured by a police officer than a terrorist.  Luckily since 2005 there have been no mass killings against the people of this country, but I feel personally that stopping the passage of this bill (if it will even be debated as a bill), and the subsequent infringement of people's liberty is worth a lot more than the miniscule number of deaths it will prevent.  It has been ruled illegal by the highest court in our system, please do not go against this.  XXXXXX is a wonderful place, and I haven't ever really felt threatened, especially by the police and security services of this country, but this feels very Orwellian, the first step down a dark road.  Please, if you do vote for the passage of this bill, please explain why, and at least alleviate these fears.

I'm british &amp; i don't mind the government watching what i do on the internet because I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.
They'll see i look on Facebook, reddit, twitter, pornhub, tumblr, youtube, netflix and unsurprisingly not think i'm a terrorist.

I really hope that one terrorist/peadophile/etc that does post his/her ""evil plans"" online does get caught, because that means i can continue to exist &amp; not get blown up.
My child (as &amp; when i have one) can grow up &amp; not be subject to people trying to groom him/etc.

So i say this to the UK Government. Go ahead, search my computer/internet history. I have absolutely nothing to hide.

And i say this to the people who are against such things:
- You probably can't stop them doing it, they're just making it more legal than it would otherwise be.

- Go out &amp; live in the countryside and away from technology, that bloke you met that one time at band camp won't mind not getting a happy birthday message this year.

- What exactly do you think they are searching for? They aren't looking at what porn you watch, gathering everybody over &amp; laughing because you have a feet fetish?

- They are searching for people that mean to do us harm. You wouldn't block a police car with blues &amp; two's on in the road because ""I pay my car tax (ALTHOUGH THAT ISN'T WHAT ITS FOR)"" &amp; you think you have a right to the whole road at all times.

The people in government are just that. People.
If you have nothing to hide you shouldn't be afraid of them.

Anyways that was back about 8 years now. When Everton had Donovan on Loan in 2010 I started to put Everton into my cycle as well. At first I fell in love with the suspense. I didn't expect them to win every game. I finally understood how nil nil can feel like a win. I was rooting for the club to do well. I didn't feel like they underachieved or were a disappointment. Then I started to get to know the history. Then the suspense. Then for whatever reason I fell in love with David Moyes. Fuck was I a fan boy. This was finally a club I could feel happy to support win or lose. And I started spending on it. I believe I've spent over 500 dollars at the store there alone keeping up with the kits and blankets. Hell I have some stupid fucking icetray so my ice can look everton. 

All I'm saying is. It just takes one little spark like it took for me to become a toffee. Every year I watch i ache at seeing how little we spend in the transfer market. Never able to get a new striker. Producing and finding under achieved talent just to have it snatched away by a big club.

I am going to do my damnedest to convince people to start watching and supporting Everton. Sure there will be a lot of new folk that just drop off after american football starts up. However, if we can continue to get support in America there is more chances that the team will come here for friendlies. Fuck yeah, so excited to see them play here again. America is also a cash cow. Majority of the people here are Man Utd and Arsenal fans. I'd like to see that change to Blue. 

TLDR: I've supported Everton for about 5 years now. Started with an American player. American support can be really good for the club.

Most polls this year have had Yes in the 35-40% area, with a couple in the low 40s, a couple in the low 30s/high 20s. By comparison the No camp seems to have a floor of around 45%, and are frequntly in the low to mid 50s. When you remove the don't knows No generally leads by 15-20%.

Of course there are, as you say, plenty of people putting down maybe or unsure when the pollsters ring them, generally about 15-20% (though there are some polls that have it as high as 30%). Unfortunately for the independence camp, they need an overwhelming majority of undecided to come out and vote for them to manage even a narrow win. And generally in referendums undecideds either don't turn  out, or they take the safe option and vote for the status quo (in this case No).

Could you give some examples, and how these are more effective?

&gt; of which a lot are in worse financial situations.

Any strike is going to inconvenience someone that is on a lower wage somewhere. While it's a nice card to play against those that are striking, you effectively take the argument down to 'they get paid more than me', which is what the government wants. It doesn't deal with the issue, it just makes people that are lower on the pay scale feel more entitled to what others have worked so hard to achieve.
The only way to solve that problem is to make everyone work for the minimum wage.

When you actually look at the amount of hours people in the public sector pull (+overtime), the effective wage drop, the skill needed for a lot of the respective industries (fire/ teaching / council) - It's not hard to see why this is happening.

Not dismissing, just discussing. :) I agree that an internal change of heart makes the most sense (and is more palatable than ""the writers dun goofed"") but I'm not sure that's the direction she would flow towards.

That implies that the gigantic personality that has the Silence trembling is what he should be striving towards, and not being that persona is naive of him. Rather, that's a different incarnation of the Doctor.

Honestly, talking this out with you has led me to my best understanding of it yet - as far as we know this is her only encounter with the 10th Doctor.

I was fined first £100, then started to get some angry letters.

The advice I was given was unanimous, go to court, show my documentation, my records of payment to the judge.

After a little over a year, someone at the SLC finally updated the correct system and *pop* I owed nothing.  The amount after fines and the like was a couple of grand higher than originally asked for too.

Giving warnings that your location will be bombed, and giving you time to leave the area is a form of psychological warfare?

Ask yourself, if you were living in Gaza would you prefer to be warned before an attack was going to happen? Or would you prefer for it to happen at any time without your knowledge? 

&gt;especially when sometimes the rockets come, sometimes they don't; sometimes they hit the target specified, sometimes they don't;

You just described perfectly what its like living in Israel under the threat of rocket attacks from Gaza. When the air raid sirens go off, nobody really knows where the rockets will land and when. 

Israel's targeted strikes are a million miles away from this, and their warnings are a courtesy that the terrorists from in Gaza would never offer the Israelis.

Whilst if the Metro or the like say it, then it's often purely speculation of some ""secret agreement"" that never materialises and the appropriate response would be ""pull the other one then...""",0,1405016893,null,0,1405019857,0,citpub2,t3_2acoi2,t1_citpub2,t1_citpe7x,null,1434648437,17,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,17

i agree with some people who have mentioned that not everybody can have the same high pay because ""we can afford it"". I also agree with the people who say that they should be happy they have a job. I haven't seen anybody mention the inconvenience so far though.
i know there's always that one person who complains and today its me but i have good reason. 
our local council failed to notify people they would strike today (not even on their website).
today was the deadline to accept my sons school place (i was sent the letter on Tuesday and have been busy searching for a job) and the local council office is at the other end of the town (i don't drive). I had to wait until today to go but checked the opening times on their website, everything was fine. When i got there they had put a small (business card size) notice on the door next to the opening times. 
i could have lost the school place for my son and would have had to sent him to a faith school four miles away (only school with space) and could have faced court. If they had put a notice on their website i would have went in earlier and ditched the job search until today but no. 

incase anyone is wondering i managed to call a local support worker who called a friend who deals with new school admissions and she agreed to fax everything in the morning.

&gt;It’s very hard to quantify what the most dislikeable aspect of Sherwood really was, because so much of his odiousness occurred behind closed doors.  He said the right things in press-conferences, he generally made all the right faces on the touchline, and actually a lot of the results achieved under him were very decent.  Even so, there was a palpable distrust between him and the fans, and that bred widespread unhappiness.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt; Giving warnings that your location will be bombed, and giving you time to leave the area is a form of psychological warfare?

The warnings are neither consistent nor accurate, yes it's a form of terrorism - it's done not as a courtesy, but to cause fear and to demonstrate power.  The people of Palestine live in what is effectively a prison, under drone filled skies, tracked 24/7.  At any time, they can be targeted for assassination by a drone or ""warned"" through a drone attack that a rocket is coming to take out their neighbour's house.  You can't set that aside the sporadic and half-arsed doodlebugs from Hamas.

You should [read a bit](http://www.waronwant.org/campaigns/corporations-and-conflict/private-armies/action/18038-killer-drones-report) about what it's like living under drones - [it fucks up your society big time](http://dronewarsuk.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/israel-and-the-drone-wars.pdf).  You can't hide from them like a plane, because they're always there; you can't hear when they're attacking, and there often appears no rationale about their targets.  It's psychologically very destructive.  Imagine trying to study or take exams under them?  Or to go on a date, sleep?

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"While I'm not necessarily saying you're wrong, I don't see how those links you post are really proving anything. I've not seen anything to suggest that Arsenal aren't on the brink of signing Sanchez (EDIT: report is now actually that they've completed the signing for £35m), or that we've not got a fee agreed for Origi. And they're not claiming that they're done deals either - they're reporting exactly to the level that exists.

The BBC isn't going to do first-hand research on every single possible story they publish, but no news site will - it's just not profitable to operate that way. But I think there's a huge difference between ""harvesting rumours"" as you say, and what they're actually doing, which is basically re-reporting what has been said by reliable journalists like Tony Barrett or stories that other respectable sources have gotten to first. And they won't openly state that they've done that, but so long as they're putting in the due diligence of only re-reporting credible sources then I don't see the difference. 

They're looking for quality of sources putting their names behind rumours rather than quantity. And they do that pretty well, and that's what I think makes them reliable source of news. They might not be the original source of the news, but if they're not they'll have least made sure that the original source is solid. Which keeps their stories reliable.

At the end of the day all news outlets are going to have to post some speculation that isn't 100% definitely true, just because until the deal is actually done and published there's no way of knowing it's definitely happening. Arsenal once even had a player profile for Jerzy Dudek on their club website before the deal broke down over the transfer fee and he eventually came to us instead. The ""won't believe until I see the lean"" joke is kind of silly, but there's a decent element of truth behind it. But I consider BBC to be pretty damn reliable because they won't say we've signed someone just because someone on Reddit said it, or ""loads of people on Twitter"", or random crap like the Metro posted it.

Getting a CB

''There are alternatives to Lovren but he remains Liverpool's No 1 defensive target. The manager believes the Croatian would be the leader and the organiser the Reds' backline was missing last season. I know eyebrows have been raised at the size of the fee considering that the Reds had a bid of around £20m rejected by Southampton last week. But Liverpool have done their homework on him and believe he's exactly what's needed.With Lovren having made it clear he wants to come to Anfield I still expect that deal to happen.'' 

Agger and Skrtel 

''Skrtel will stay put but obviously there are question marks over Agger's future. I can't see him being first choice and he won't want to stay as a squad player. If Lovren gets done then I can see Agger being sold. I'd put Agger in the same bracket as Lucas – the club aren't desperate to off-load them but both are high earners and no longer guaranteed starters so LFC would sell if right offer comes long.''

From the club's Q&amp;A:
Are you looking to remove the Castle?

This is something we've considered from the outset and has the backing of the vast majority of supporters. Our view is that retiring the castle from our Club crest would be a fitting way to respectfully signal a departure from the Boleyn Ground. Fans are overwhelmingly in agreement that it does not make sense to have the Boleyn Castle in our Club crest when we no longer play at the Boleyn Ground.

Like I said, I've been lurking all the boards and one thing that I've noticed, and it goes to the heart of this topic, is that it doesn't really matter about the reliability of the site or the truth in what is reported.

Fans will believe what they want to believe and dismiss what they want to dismiss, no matter what.

One reason I've lurked here in particular is so far *most* of the news posted in /r/LiverpoolFC has been pretty accurate! But the people here have dismissed and insulted every bit of news they didn't really want to see. From the early reports of Barca's interest, to the attempts to use players to create a player+cash deal, to Barca requiring an apology before making an official bid to Sanchez preferring Arsenal over Liverpool, I've seen each and every bit of that news dismissed as bullshit by you guys...so the question is, why does it matter how reliable the news sources are?

Mangala is a raw talent, a great athlete and a decent footballer.

With the highline we play under Pellegrini he'd be better suited to us than Benatia IMO.

He's also much younger, with the potential to become a stalwart in the side for years to come.

I also haven't been too enamoured his negotiating tactics, and the way it appears he doesn't place much value on us courting him.

However, this is modern football. He isn't a City fan, nor is Benatia.

There's a time and a place for sentiment, and with key signings this isn't it - IMO.

If he's hesitant, give him a deadline, and should he decide against it we'll move for Benatia. Relatively simple.

I'd prefer Mangala, but Benatia would be a good signing also.

Everything from legislation to stop people hunting and fishing (and thus having access to food without labouring), through the enclosure acts, through to the Combination Acts to prevent workers joining together and a de facto internal passport system, was designed to keep the ordained order of rich people living off of the poor intact.

You were right, the original post could have been a hoax attempting to make the loyalist bonfire look bad. The photo wasn't great. LAD have a history of sensationalising and are clearly not an impartial news source. However, if the story was legit - and proper news sources seem to at least partially confirm it - it wouldn't be unprecedented: another loyalist bonfire burnt a Mary statue last year. They took it from a local Catholic church and returned it scorched and vandalised. So a story like this wouldn't even be unusual behaviour.

Secondly, loyalist bonfires are already doing plenty to make *themselves* look bad. There's the usual petty burning of tricolours and politicians from the 'other side', which is pretty hateful in itself. There's also the harder element of putting up signs saying 'KAT', and flying paramilitary flags. That's anathema to every law-abiding person in the North, and for all that this subreddit has a republican majority, I've yet to see anyone defend active paramilitarism on the nationalist side. 

I fully recognise that these people are not representative of the wider unionist community. I doubt they even represent all bonfires: friends who grew up in different areas remember the Twelfth as a happy street party, and don't have a bigoted bone in their bodies. However, that doesn't make it possible to ignore that nasty minority. The good people of the unionist community should be livid that this is how their genuine, respectable culture is being portrayed, livid not at the media or the 'intolerant' nationalists, but at the bad behaviour of a rotten few in their own camp.

I went back on youtube and espn3 and watched the intl friendly, WC, and club highlights. He has the versatility (pace, dribbling, passing, finishing, heading) to play on the wing or up top. I think we could be very dangerous with two goal-scoring wingers like Zarate and Valencia. When you factor in his relatively young age, and the fact that he led his domestic league in scoring, I can see the hefty price tag. I can't say whether he'll be worth it or not, but I'm excited to see what he can do if we do end up picking him up.

Ackshly, most doctors will tell you some old tripe about how the 'safe' drinking numbers came about in the first place, be that the official 21 per week for men or 14 for women, or the *other* official 28M/21F standard. Both of which are somewhat murky and arbitrary in their origins.

The thing is, trying to apply convenient standards across a widely varying population is a fucking recipe for confusion in the first place, and just fudges any actual attempt at harm reduction *at the individual level*. 21M/14F might prove to be fairly sensible for an entire population, but it's just lazy hand-wavy bullshit when it is inanely applied to individuals. The same goes for 'binges' - they're just nonsense vaguenesses with no real practical application other than for red top copy writers.

You might as well say ""the average shoe size is 8, so *don't fucking wear 9s or 7s 'cos you'll die horribly in some bizarre podiatric catastrophe!*""

So what we are left with is a vague ""booze is bad for you, m'kay?"", which is actually sound advice since it doesn't fucking pretend that a one-size-fits-all approach is remotely useful, or that you can infer individual impacts from population trends.

Personally, I drink like an absolute twat, always have done, and choose still to do. I also have a reasonable amount of exercise, really rather a good diet, tend not to indulge in other risky behaviours, and when I had my last health check the practice nurse seemed almost disappointed that my herculean consumption of booze alone didn't really kick my health score into the red.

If you want to know about the harms from booze, then you need to know a whole lot about booze, what it does, and how *you* react to it and use it. Stupid slack-jawed jackass attempts to distil it down to binge/not binge is just a distraction.

For the avoidance of doubt this has been a rant about public policy on alcohol, not a pop at Spanties. Aaaaaaaaand breathe. Ah. that's better. Moony, another round of binges please!",0,1405023175,null,0,false,0,cittf4v,t3_2abt8a,t1_cittf4v,t1_citmlt7,null,1434650215,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

&gt;The __Tonypandy Riots__  of 1910 and 1911 (sometimes collectively known as the __Rhondda Riots__) was a series of violent confrontations between [coal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal) [miners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miners) and police that took place at various locations in and around the [Rhondda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhondda) mines of the Cambrian Combine, a business network of mining companies formed to regulate prices and wages in [south](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales) [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales). The riots were the culmination of an [industrial dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_dispute) between workers and the [mine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_coal_mining) [owners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownership). The term ""Tonypandy riot"" initially applied to specific events on the evening of Tuesday 8 November 1910, when strikers, impassioned by extended hand-to-hand fighting with the [Glamorgan Constabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamorgan_Constabulary), reinforced by the [Bristol City Constabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_City_Constabulary),  smashed windows of businesses in [Tonypandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonypandy).

Look - I won't vote Tory ever again - Home Buy has been the most economically damaging policy to bring out in the last 4 years.

But economical cycles are long. And New Labour devastated the UK with massive social change and upheaval.

You've got a police force that cannot enforce the law out of fear of being labelled racist. You've got teachers trying to manage classes full of English-as-a-second-language students. You have social housing being given out in the centre of London while hard working individuals are holed up in share flats. You've had the country's gold reserves sold off.

What part of any of that could be reversed by the Conservative party in 4 years? Sure - they've utterly destroyed the traditional and long-standing social view of what marriage was - but they cannot magically undo all the other havoc wreaked on society for a decade before.

More general tips would be to spend your time at uni learning skills that will be useful for being FI  and just generally enjoying life, so learning how to cook healthy, tasty and inexpensive meals. Exercising or taking part in team sports to stay physically active and healthy. Finding activities and hobbies that don't involved spending thousands of pounds a year. 

I would also recommend spending some time tutoring as you will be able to boost your income whilst helping you revise your subject, it's a very cost effective way of spending time outside of uni.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Peterborough doesn't have a university like Cambridge, so it won't have all the students. But I think the nightlife is pretty good considering. I've never been out in Cambridge, but I know people who live in between Cambridge and Peterborough, and if they're going out clubbing they would choose Peterborough. Cambridge will be trendier but more expensive, plus I suspect it goes a bit dead out of uni term time or during exam periods (someone correct me if this is untrue).

I just wanted to say that there's a lot of hate for Peterborough in this thread which I feel is a bit unjustified. We tend to be a very self depreciating lot, so don't take it too seriously. Peterborough has some very nice areas to live in (for relatively cheaply), and it's actually a fair bit bigger than Cambridge, so anything you can find there, you can find in Peterborough (and more). Plus it has some of the best transport links in the country, it's on the east coast mainline so London (45mins away), York (1:30hrs), Durham (2:15hrs), Newcastle (2:30hrs) and Edinburgh (3:30hrs) are all very accessible. By car, you have the A1, which goes all the way from London to Edinburgh, right next to Peterborough.

Peterborough is very multicultural, it is essentially a city built up by immigrants. Italians in the 50's &amp; 60's (of which I am a descendant), Pakistanis and Indians in the 70's and 80's, and now most recently eastern europeans. Then there is the constant stream of Londoners (of which the other half of my family come from). Some people don't like this, but I personally love it! Not least because of all the good Indian and Italian restaurants. 

Now Peterborough is not without it's problems, but it's nowhere near as bad as some people make out. Essentially it boils down to getting more for your money in Peterborough, or spending more to live in Cambridge which is very lovely, but what's the point if you can't afford to enjoy yourself? Personally I think Peterborough has more on offer and you can always visit Cambridge as much as you want anyway, it's only 45 mins away.",0,1405024559,null,0,false,0,citu70l,t3_2a9nfc,t1_citu70l,t1_cisw4y6,null,1434650583,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,Melberger,null,null,"Nastasic is a real talent, but he has struggled to adapt to a new style of play under Pellegrini.

He excelled under Mancini, when we played more conservatively, the back four was deeper and had more protection from the midfield.

Nastasic is an intelligent player, but he's more of a passive centre half, he's not a front foot and aggressive centre half like Kompany, who'll step out of the defence and win the ball. Nastasic isn't very good at this. He sits, and clears up while his partner tends to step out and take the responsibility of pressing. He learnt his trade in Italy, where defenders like him excel, and he did just that under a similar style of play with us. Positionally he's sound, he's strong and he's a very tidy and composed footballer, even when under pressure.

But he hasn't adapted to our highline approach under Pellegrini, it doesn't seem to suit his game. He has appeared unsure defensively, and error prone playing is this system, looking a completely different player to the one who debuted at the Bernabeu. 

It's critical to recognise the strengths and weaknesses of a player when discussing their value to a side. The side under Mancini bears little resemblance to the approach and tactics of Pellegrini's side.

Nastasic simply doesn't appear best suited to the style of football we player under Pellegrini.

Mangala however is a front foot and aggressive defender, he has the raw athleticism and aggression to be a beast in this system. There are few players who appear better suited to it.

Nastasic has also had a lot of injury problems over the past year.

I think it's important to note that Mangala is the superior player at present, and is better suited to our style of play under Pellegrini. ""Young and with potential"" would be doing him a disservice, he is of course both these things, but he already has the quality to play alongside Vinnie right now - with the potential for further improvement.

Mangala could prove to be the perfect fit for us, Benatia close, but no Cigar IMO.

I think this is reflected in the lengths the club are going to sign him.",0,1405024633,null,0,false,0,citu8kd,t3_2ac2xk,t1_citu8kd,t1_citsy65,null,1434650600,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

I also think Smith does remember his interaction with the Curator, and I'll explain why.  I think the Curator was being intentionally cagey during that scene.  He kept lightly hinting at the idea that he was a future incarnation, but he never outright said it, and he seemed to desperately want Smith to remain unsure as well.  I think his commitment to establishing the uncertainty was vital to his purpose in that scene.  He needed Smith to not know, but to suspect in order to ensure Smith would take him seriously, and remember him.  I think the memory loss only happens if the Doctor actually knows he's meeting a future incarnation.  The fact that Smith is never 100% sure allows him to keep his memory of the meeting, which is why he remembers his new mission to find Gallifrey.  In the epilogue he talks about how he is finally certain of his destination, he says ""It's taken me so many years and so many lifetimes, but at last I know where I'm going, home, the long way round.""

Right now we can't compete with the top four in the only thing that really matters - money. United are one of, if not the biggest, clubs in the word (as shown by their recent kit deal). Chelsea and City are bankrolled by billionaires which we can't compete with. And Arsenal have just gone through building the Emirates which is massively boosting their revenue, and have sacrificed having an amazing squad these past years, to ensure that they don't accrue massive amounts of debt. Arsenal are in a very wealthy area that is able to charge higher priced tickets, and offer commercial booths.

***General info about us***

* Based in North London.

* We are one of the oldest cubs in the prem and have never been out of the ~~top division~~ Prem.

* Are main rivals are Arsenal. Other rivals are West Ham and Chelsea (and a lot of us Spurs fans hate Real Madrid)

* Our league position aims are always a minimum of 4th, in which we realistically expect 4th, nothing more. But then we finish 5th a lot, which we are always *ok* with.


***Info on our current team***

* Lloris (our keeper - 2nd best in the world), Eriksen (our midfield maestro) and Vertonghen (our star CB - one of the best in the prem) are our key players. Learn about them and always keep an eye out for them.

* Dawson is our captain but he's widely expected to leave in the coming weeks and it will most likely be Lloris who will become our new captain

* Our new manager is a promising, tactical and relatively young Argentine called Mauricio Pochettino. He replaced Tim Sherwood (a failed project) who took over from AVB (a very young, very bright manager who was relatively controversially sacked)

* We are in desperate need of a new left-back and you will hear us constantly whine about it (but we like whining about it, don't worry). We also need a new striker, although not essential, we are lacking in goal scoring ability up front (which has been a major problem of ours for the last couple of seasons). Lastly, we are also desperate for a playmaker (someone who spots that pass) as we sold one of the best playmakers in the world a couple of years ago (modric) and haven't replaced him since.

* **Lamela!!!!!!!!!!** He is the player we will probably talk about most. He's our record signing for 30mil. He got a succession of bad injuries last season which extremely hindered him. He's young and got a ridiculous, mouth-watering amount of potential thats just dying to be harvested.


***Important people associated with the club***

* **Bill Nicholson**. Look him up, seriously. He is our god. Legend amongst legends. He guided us to unparalleled triumphs and got us to the height of world football in the 60s. He was our manager in the late 50s, the 60s and the 70s.

* Ledley King. Nicknamed 'The King of the Lane'. He was our captain from 2005 till his retirement 2 years ago. He was one of the best english 21st century CB's. He's my all-time favourite player and I'm sure he is too for the majority of Spurs fans. He is now an ambassador for the club.

* Harry Redknapp. Some may think this is a strange one. He managed us from 08 to 12 and got us to play some of the best football the club had ever done. He was one of our best managers ever (certainly in the 21st century) and guided us to an unbelievable quarter-final place in the Champions League. He is still hugely popular amongst Spurs fans, especially American fans, as he was one of the, if not THE, main reasons of the massive increase in American support for spurs from 08 onwards (due to his amazing attacking play).

* Daniel Levy. Our current chairman. Loves to drive a hard bargain. Extremely (if not the best in the world) good at getting an amazing return (money wise) on our players. Views on him are so incredibly 50/50, best to stay out of Levy debates until you've done your homework.

***Extra info***

* We tend to sell our superstars, so watch out.

* Spurs are known throughout English football that their fans suffer the most. This is due to the ~~literal~~ figurative roller-coaster of a season we have (you'll find out soon enough).

* In the last 6 years we have gone off the boil towards the last stretch of the PL, usually March time -- so watch out for that 

* Our nicknames are: Yid Army, Yids, Spurs and The Lillywhites

I'm by no means an expert but the debate normally has these two views in my experience.

A framework and guide of basically what not to do for the Government . Make it changeable sure, but very very hard so the Government can't abuse certain areas (speech , due process, privacy whatever). The cons of no written constitution is the ability to quickly change laws which will be abused by government. 


People who support no written constitution like our current system claim its ability to be changed easily means its dynamic and modern/21st century ect and the con of the written constitution is the lack of changing means populations will be stuck with old laws/ideology it no longer follows/accepts.

How many players did city buy and get rid of after they got bought out  before they found a team that worked? Colossal waste of money.

I have faith in BR, sure he made a few dodgy signings last season but he's also made some stunners, and look what he has done with out team in 2 seasons... 

He knows what he needs to keep building his team, we know what he wants works and so I will be happy with whoever he brings in. Really excited to see Can and Lallana in action, and if we sign Markovic I cannot WAIT to see him play either.

It's not like were not trying to bring in the big names either... it's just unfortunately we seem to be losing out to the appeal of London at the moment.

Long and short of it is, given our upcoming season, I would much rather we have oodles of depth, in a less experienced but young and ever improving set of players that one or two super signings that get injured and fuck up our season.

We don't want to be in a position where we are so dependent on (and worried about injuries with) one or two players; if we want to be regular champions league contenders again that can no longer be the case.

&gt;Bony went on trial at [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League) club [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) in 2007 but was not offered a contract, and in October 2007, Bony joined [Czech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic) club [Sparta Prague](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta_Prague) on a loan deal where he immediately started playing for the reserve team. Bony won the [Bohemian Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemian_Football_League) championship with Sparta Prague B.  

&gt;Bony then joined the club on a permanent basis and broke into the first team in the [2008–09 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%9309_Gambrinus_liga), scoring three goals in 16 appearances.

&gt;After scoring 17 goals during the first half of the [2010–11 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Gambrinus_liga),  including five goals in six appearances in the [UEFA Europa League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_UEFA_Europa_League),  Bony was signed by Dutch [Eredivisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie) club [Vitesse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitesse) of [Arnhem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnhem) in January 2011.

The threat of strike action, while it should be a last resort, clearly helped towards an agreement. They've worked out a deal that helps both existing and future staff. 


The agreements means:

- Royal Mail can't outsource jobs currently done by Royal Mail staff

- Royal Mail won't employ anybody on a zero hours contract and people won't be allowed to be on ongoing temporary contracts and the workforce will remain predominantly full time.

- New recruits will have the same terms and conditions as existing ones.

Overall I think trade unions are a good thing, and it's not the case that they need to be in constant conflict with an employer. They can work together towards both benefitting employee conditions and rights while maintaining a successful and profitable business (as Royal Mail shows). It's the staff who make the company work, so you need to have them on your side.

true,[deleted],null,null,"""*Steven Gerrard may start only half of Liverpool's matches next season as Brendan Rodgers tries to come up with a plan to keep the 34-year-old in peak condition until May. 

The signing of £10m German defensive midfielder Emre Can last week from Bayer Leverkusen is integral for the Liverpool manager's strategy to pick and choose the matches that Gerrard appears in after 15 years of first team action.

Gerrard had one of his best seasons for a while in 2013/14 and was impressive in playing 51 times for club and country last season but the effort caught up with him at the end and he made costly mistakes for Liverpool against Chelsea and for England in the World Cup against Uruguay.

Rodgers now plans talks with his talisman about his personal rotation as Liverpool gear up for their first Champions League campaign since 2009. He's also expected to announce his retirement from international football shortly, which will help prolong his club career. 

Rodgers has previously said the player can continue his career in a deep-lying midfield role until he's 40, which might be overly optimistic, especially after a difficult summer full of costly mistakes, after which Gerrard admitted he was ""broken"". 

Gerrard was one of Liverpool's most important players in their recent title challenge and Rodgers will want to keep him involved in the club for as long as possible.*""",0,1405032009,null,0,false,0,city20p,t3_2adgw7,t1_city20p,t3_2adgw7,null,1434652400,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I think it mostly comes down to Suarez though, If I am a top player, I don't want to join a team that is selling their best player if there are other more stable clubs offering better or similar wages. Also, it is a lot of pressure for a top player to fill the boots of Suarez, because lets face it, that's who any marquee striker we buy will be  judged against, fairly or not. 

At least a few of the things I mentioned will be going against us. Does not mean we cant buy a top quality player though, but top quality = more sought after so we are bound to miss out on a few.

Neoliberalism has a bigger role for government than either the libertarian right or left. And Neoliberalism has very little in common with the libertarian left. 

&gt;In common use, liberal means the opposite.

The only time I've heard of liberal meaning the opposite is in the US. In the UK it tends to mean either social liberalism, economic liberalism or neoliberalism.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; how on earth are we going to win anything?

By getting to the point where we have the cash resources to attract players. Manchester City didn't all of a sudden become a destination overnight for any reason other than them having money to spend, and assembling a good squad through spending money. 

&gt;even if just our best player each year leaves, then we have no shot at actually getting back to the top again for any sustained amount of time.

Yeah but thats what Arsenal had to go through these past 5-6 years. They couldn't spend lots of money because of the interest payments on the Emirates. Now that the Emirates is completed and they have the cash flow, they can keep their best players and attract new ones to build a good, strong squad. 

&gt;but then you guys tend to tack ""we are building long term success"" on to the end of the post, and that makes no sense.

I didn't tack it on at the end of the post, I pretty much said it from the beginning. 

&gt; Who says Real doesn't come in for Markovic in two years? Or City come in for Lallana?

They might do. But thats my problem, we don't have the resources to keep them. We need to take a short term hit to our squad in order to invest for the future. I would rather take that short term suffering in order to have the future cash resources in order to assemble a squad that can compete through out. 

&gt;There is not a sustained period of EPL/CL challenging coming again for us if we concede all the points you seem to be conceded.

I completely disagree. If we keep acting like we have done then we're going to stay a fringe top-4 team with the occasional exciting finish. If we invest in our commercial revenue and our matchday revenue then we'll have the resources to be a consistent title challenger.

true,Mayniac182,cnty-england,London,"I too don't think that storing metadata is that big of an issue. 

The problem is access to that data. BBC says that a warrant can be issued from a senior government minister. That means fuck all. There needs to be clear, concise and reserved legislation on when and why someone can access that data. Firstly if only police can access that data, that means if you get arrested for something you didn't do, your solicitor can't prove you didn't do it by showing that you were actually at home at the time binge watching Breaking Bad on Netflix. The CPS can show that, but if it's against their case then they can brush it under the carpet. Secondly, if there aren't clear access controls on the ISPs end, an employee working for BT could set up a filter where anyone who visits christianmingle.com and hardcoregayporn.com is flagged up, then use that data for blackmail. Thirdly, someone working for the police could get a warrant to access their mate's ISP logs due to ""reasonable suspicion he's a bloody terrorist"" and have a laugh over their porn use at the pub. Finally, police could monitor the IP addresses of anyone accessing radical political forums and give them ""special attention""

The government has no fucking idea how technology works, and they've proven that time and time again. If this wasn't emergency legislation, and the scope of access was thought out properly and the public had input, then I wouldn't give a shit about this either. But since it's emergency legislation, they're going to fuck it up massively. There's a shit tonne that can go wrong with laws like this, and the less time spent on writing laws which limit access to metadata the more issues regarding privacy are going to come about.

Sorry, but as far as I'm concerned, that breaks one of the founding rules of intellectual freedom, which is that *anything* no matter how apparently certain should be up for debate.  

Let me see if I can explain why.  

Part of the problem is that you (or anyone else) feeling certain about a proposition does not make it true.  You must have noticed that in internet arguments (and arguments in general) it's possible for two people who have opposing views to both feel absolutely certain that they are right, when logically, at most one can be correct.  Therefore, it cannot follow that certainty alone guarantees that ideas are true.

So, how *can* we know if ideas are true?  This is the field known as  *epistemology*, and the best explanation I'm aware of come from how scientists approach hypothesis testing.  

In the scientific approach, *no* hypothesis can ever be held to be finally true with 100% certainty.  However, we can sort out the good from the bad ideas by subjecting all claims to scrutiny (i.e. criticism) and by seeing which ideas are left standing.  Thus, an idea is considered good if many people try, but fail, to knock it down using the best arguments available.  But the point is that in order for this process to work, you have to allow *all* ideas to be criticized.

But then there is also the flip side to the issue, that the same gullible people who cant tell the difference, or just want to see what they want, will be able to post links not within the constraints of the five current sites, and other gullible people will then think that because it does not have the tag, it is more reliable, due to some pseudo-implied hierarchy where by the people who set up the tags think that the website not considered 'unreliable' is actually reliable. 

Also, there will always be people who cry out about sources being rubbish, and that's fine, even I get annoyed sometimes, but I'd have to admit at the same time that it creates discussion.

Now discussion is important at a time like this, there is not much match news and in general discussions keep people here. Now I cant see into the future, but earlier someone posted a link earlier that they deleted several minutes later, (presumably) because the tag was attributed to it, I don't know, However, if this happens, because a negative connotation appears with the 'unreliable' tags, and only a few of the people (as mentioned above) post unreliable sources, because they do not want to receive the down-votes, we could see an overall stagnation in activity, because if nothing is happening, people will not stay here, and if nothing happens for long periods, people may stop checking the sub so regularly, thus decreasing activity. 

As whilst unreliable sources can be so annoying, for me at least they act as fluff, but necessary fluff, its good to know that since the last hour you checked people have been discussing, you feel like joining in and such.

No you don't.

You've got a police force that is massively underfunded due to Tory austerity measures. 

You've got teachers trying to manage classes full of English-as-a-second-language students. 


Hardly. 

Maybe a handful of schools at best. The primary issues are that teachers work on average 10 hour days during term time, a lot of this in their own time. You have a government interfering in how schools are run and what they teach directly against the advice of the professionals. 

&gt;have social housing being given out in the centre of London while hard working individuals are holed up in share flats. 

Yes because the biggest issue is social housing, not that London has seen an astronomical increase in the cost of property due to millionaires buying up swathes of property and letting it out at an over inflated price.



&gt;What part of any of that could be reversed by the Conservative party in 4 years? Sure - they've utterly destroyed the traditional and long-standing social view of what marriage was - but they cannot magically undo all the other havoc wreaked on society for a decade before.

Literally everything I listed is their fault.

People didn't vote for UKIP just because of their views on the EU, they voted for them because they saw them as different. However, after the European elections, all the politicians from Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems spoke about was them needing to change their views on the EU, not them needing to represent the views of the people better. 

If I go onto any major British news site with comments, the top comments across the board, and across the political spectrum, are overwhelmingly negative of this bill. The people of Britain do not want this. However, all three parties are pushing it through and ignoring criticism, barely even discussing the bill and rushing it through hoping people will forget about it. Again, they are showing they don't represent the views of the people, only the views of themselves, and that, in the important matters, the heads of the parties at least all think the same way. 

They seem to have missed to message that the growth of UKIP sent, that people are tired of the parties acting in their own interests, and acting exactly the same.

I don't think Pellegrini preferred him to Demichelis to be honest. Martin arrived at the end of the summer transfer window, and had a knee injury at the time.

When he recovered he was introduced almost immediately around October.

Nastasic was struggling for form and didn't seem to have adapted that well to the change of system. We were shipping a lot of goals in the early stages of the season, although the whole defence was culpable of course.

It's understandable that Pellegrini would bring in Demichelis though because he understood the way Pellegrini liked to play, and was used to playing the role he was asked of when he came here.

Then Nastasic suffered a lot of problems with his knee, and never got another look in.

He could play a big part in the club's future, and I hope he does, but I'm sceptical that he has the attributes to be a success in our new system. If we sign Mangala he'll effectively be fourth choice at centre half, which is never a good thing for a young player.

Absolutely no idea where you're coming from with being more worried about Kompany adapting to the high line. He has adapted.

His form was occasionally hit and miss, but he was also adapting to a new partner at centre half for much of the campaign. He was still a key player and is always a noticeably huge loss when he doesn't play.

No worries at all there for me.

If we sign Mangala and Kompany remains injury free, we could have the strongest centre half pairing in Europe next season.",0,1405038199,null,0,false,0,ciu0ysl,t3_2ac2xk,t1_ciu0ysl,t1_ciu0j1n,null,1434653838,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

true,OllieSimmonds,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Your idea of 'people like me' is true to some extent, indeed I don't use public services regularly, its also true that people who take more from the state are more likely to favour nationalisation and a big state. Its important to remember, that although that position enlightens you about the plight of some of the vulnerable and unfortunate, it can, not always, distort your opinion because it means that you may favour emotive rather than practical policies based on emotion rather than pragmatism. Often the right-wing, classical liberal views about economics are more complicated but 'both surprising and true'.

Your view on nationalisation is rather simplistic, it may be true that nationalisation allows the wealthiest people, the major stock holders, to make a profit but that doesn't need to be at the consumers expense, in fact, it almost invariably isn't, because **privatisation almost always means that consumers get a higher quality good or service and a lower price**, this is true in the case of almost all industries that have been privatised since the 70s. The phrase 'people and profit' is meaningless and quite frankly facile, because profit isn't necessarily at the expense of people.

And look our revenues in the last few years. We've done phenomenally well. Yes, expanding Anfield will help, but it isn't going to double our annual matchday revenue.

On the model you give, the only way for LFC to consistently be a contender is to consistently get it near perfect in the transfer market. No one does that. At some point we've got to keep hold of players. The next big hurdle will be to keep Sturridge, if he plays like we expect this year.

Yeah completely agree.

&gt;the only way for LFC to consistently be a contender is to consistently get it near perfect in the transfer market. 

I didn't comment on our effectiveness in the transfer market. What I did say is that we need more baseline cash, and the ability to spend more for us to be more competitive in it. 

&gt;At some point we've got to keep hold of players.

I want to hold on to our players. I think we should and its good for the club. I'd love to strike a balance between fielding a good team, and investing in our club for growth. 

&gt;In this league, money is most important for consistency.

Completely agree.

&gt; we don't have much of a hope to be perennial contenders unless one of them has a drastic change.

I disagree. On paper I find it difficult to believe that our teams will be better on average then Chelsea's, United's, or City's barring something extraordinary happening. But football matches aren't won on paper, so I do have hope.


I think we have a lot in common with our viewpoints. 

I believe that right now the club isn't capable of mounting a consistent title challenge because we don't have the revenue to compete with the top 4. I think for the next couple years we should invest in Anfield, and dramatically increase our matchday revenue. I do believe we can double our matchday revenue, because [Arsenal managed to do even better in their move from Highbury to Emirates](http://populous.com/project/emirates-stadium/). As for reasons why, I believe that money dominates football, and except for one offs, this has proved mostly true in the world of football. 


I think if we don't invest in our club now, we risk getting left behind as the other big clubs keep moving ahead. United, Chelsea, and City have shown that the more successful your club is, the increase in commercial revenue you receive. This means you can't boost commercial revenue without first boosting your team's performance. In order to ensure a long term boost in team performance, we need to have increased revenue, which will happen from a cash injection into Anfield and a redevelopment. Liverpool doesn't have infinite financial resources to redevelop the club, and I think we should use the Suarez money, on this occasion, to help redevelop anfield.

RB: Juliano Belletti - could've picked Paulo but I'll take the guy who scored worldies against Spurs and Boro and the guy scored the winner against Arsenal in the CL Final (albeit as a Barca player)

CB: John Terry and David Luiz - Daivd Luiz is going to held in a high opinion at the Bridge even though he has moved on and John Terry is, well, John Terry.

LB: Ashley Cole. ""They say Germans don't lose on penalties"" ""They do now""

CM: Claude Makelele - remember how mental everyone (players and fans) went when Maka scored that penalty against Charlton? Enough said.

CM: Frank Lampard. Because Frank Lampard

LM: Going to do a Kevin Keegan and chuck Dennis Wise out on the left. Was Chelsea most successful captain before the John Terry/Roman era. Loved to get stuck in, which we all appreciated and genuinely loved the club.

RM: Roberto di Matteo. Feel bad for not picking him as the coach so he can play on the right. Scorer of 3 Wembley Cup Final goals and sent us on the way to our first trophy in decades in 1997.

ST: Gianfranco Zola. We still sing his name today and rightly so. Was voted Chelsea's best ever player in 2003 and no-one has taken his coveted #25 shirt and no-one ever should.

ST: Peter Osgood. Again, even 35 years since he played for us he name and song can be heard around Stamford Bridge and also the only player to be honoured with a statue outside Stamford Bridge. The definition of cult hero.

Arsenal continued to be Arsenal.  They played some great football, and when all theier players were fit they were great.  BUt Ozil turned out to be a player that plays well when the team does.  He was another creative player, when they needed a finisher.  As the season went on, they folded like  a flan in a cupboard.

The team is what matters.  We need good, young, exciting players who play the way we want to play.

None of this has anything to do with democracy. Democracy is a political system characterised by representative government or direct referenda.

Okore is probably one of our best players but we haven't seen much because of an unlucky injury.  Same with Kozak, although I think he's shown enough to at least be worth the money we paid.  That's not even considering the fact that Lambert technically signed Guzan and got Fabian, Andi, and Gabby in good form again.  

Comparing us to QPR is a joke.  QPR signed a bunch of mediocre players for big money and paid them big money.  None of our signings so far this year are getting big money.  I can guarantee that.

If he doesn't have a buyer by then Lerner will invest.  He doesn't know soccer, but he knows business enough to know we're worth more in the Premiere League.

Like I said I'm not happy about things either, but lets not let r/avfc become like all the other Villa sites that just have a bunch of people pissing and moaning no matter what, not making sense.  Pissing and moaning is okay in times like these to a certain extent, but lets at least  piss and moan with some sense.",0,1405044692,null,0,false,0,ciu3vaz,t3_2aac3v,t1_ciu3vaz,t3_2aac3v,null,1434655635,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2

He bought in and became a duet up front and helped make us winners. It was easy to see that Luis took matters into his own hands resulting in lost chances less last year than years previous.

•Brendan took 'selfish' Daniel Sturridge and made him part of what would later be called 'SAS', but to Brendan it was two able bodied forwards playing up and off one another. 

•Sturridge is already accustomed to rotating up top and dropping deep throughout the game the way Luis did, and the way we saw Raheem switch wings, etc. Brendan forces players to be dynamic, but excel by playing them to their strengths.

Westminster doesn't really have a choice.

How fickle are the supporters? Are the expectations always so high that there's a good chance for the fans to turn on Tino if the season doesn't start out perfectly, and does Levy listen? I can't tell if supporters are just reacting to constant controversial decisions from Levy and managers or if Levy makes certain decisions because of public backlash, or if Sherwood was just a unique case of alienating everyone.
