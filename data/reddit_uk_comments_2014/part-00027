&gt; I think, considering how much worse off starving children in Africa (for example) are, having to politely say 'no thank you' to someone isn't such a blight on your life, honestly.

Of course but that's not really a fair comparison. Everything could be compared to something like that and then we would never try to improve anything. 

&gt; If you feel guilty, ask yourself this. Can you give money to charity? If not, you have nothing to feel guilty about. But if you're out shopping to buy the latest iThing and you literally give no money to charity at all, well, a bit of guilt will do you good.

No, I don't feel guilty. Not only do I work for charity and volunteer my time but I also give to charity in various ways. Even still, my issue is that they are not improving the society we live in, not whether or not it bothers me that they're asking for money for charity.

&gt; edit: I just want to clarify, I don't know if collectors are the best or most efficient or most convenient way to raiser money for charitable causes. My issue is with blaming them for your guilt.


I do know that street collection is not the best way for charities to recruit new donors since they have a really high attrition rate.

Where did I say I was blaming them for my guilt (that I never said I had)? My whole issue is that their methods do not make our society better, it makes it slightly worse and colder.

Absolutely incorrect article on all fronts. If anything, Inter suffered on the long term as a result of Mourinho's tenure there. Notice that the vast majority of the first team squad was in their late 20s, nearing 30s, resulting in an overaged Inter squad maintained by Moratti's love for the treble winning squad. The likes of Stankovic, Maicon, Lucio, Cambiasso, and Chivu should have all left in either 2010 or 2011.

For heavens sake, the average age of the starting lineup in the 2009-10 season was 31 years old. And the substitute bench had two players over 35 (Materazzi and Toldo).

Furthermore, Inter has had a fairly strong youth academy for quite a while now. Moreover, it was under Rafael Benitez that a youth philosophy was truly implemented, wherein he unsuccessfully attempted to integrate Phillipe Coutinho, Jonathan Biabiany, Joel Obi, and Macdonald Mariga in the first team squad. He really encouraged the creation of a youth project, and to wrongfully credit Mourinho with the Primavera's recent success is simply poor journalism.

If anything, the Mourinho period stagnated Inter with his failure to actually create some sort of longevity at the club. The fact that Balotelli wasn't given a concrete spot in the first team, and was fourth in the pecking order indicates how he was unwilling to make sacrifices for long term development at the club. And Balotelli is perhaps one of the most talented players to have graduated from the Nerazzurri's youth ranks.

Also, the example of Lorenzo Crisetig, who broke through on the Primavera level at the age of 16 but wasn't given any minutes in the starting lineup further demonstrates my point. For 3 years he continued to play with the Primavera, and this undoubtedly haltered his development. AC Milan have been pushing the FIGC to allow them to field 16 year old Hachim Mastour, and yet Inter made no similar initiative to give Crisetig a proper chance in the squad.

To show Inter as an institution of strong youth development is frankly misguided, considering that it's more of a youth market than a youth program. Giulio Donati and Luca Caldirola were excellent at the European u-21 Championships, and yet Moratti opted to cash in on them for mere peanuts. And now they are being lauded as brilliant signings by the German media.

There is no true youth legacy at Inter. I could even bring up the example of Coutinho, but now I'm getting tired. The only apparent progress has been in the last year, where players such as Juan Jesus (22), Saphir Taïder (21), Mateo Kovačić (19), Mauro Icardi (20), and Ishak Belfodil (21) are integral players in the squad.",0,1390893343,null,0,false,0,cf0s36h,t3_1wacch,t1_cf0s36h,t3_1wacch,null,1432140600,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

&gt; What I expect

                Lloris

    Walker - Dawson - Vlad - Rose

          Bentaleb - Dembele

    Lennon - Eriksen - Chadli/Siggy

                 Ade

&gt; What I hope

                Lloris

    Walker - Vlad - Vertonghen - Rose

           Capoue - Dembele

       Lennon - Eriksen - Townsend

                 Ade

&gt; Subs (for what I expect)

* Paulinho on for Dembele

* Capoue on for Betaleb (out of necessity when we're struggling because we don't have a DM)

* Townsend on for Chadli/Siggy

* If not one of the above, Vertonghen on for Dawson or Vlad

&gt; Thoughts/notes

* We *NEED* to start with a DM. Bentaleb is great and I know Sherwood loves the kid, but City's midfield will run all over him. If we start with a 4-4-2 and Bentaleb... (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

* Townsend should be match fit, but Sherwood might not want to throw him back into the starting lineup against City.

* All indications are that Vertonghen and Paulinho are ready, but same reasoning for Townsend stands: Sherwood might not want to risk it in a big match like this.

* I'm conflicted, I want Defoe to get some playing time, but I also want our returners to get some good runouts for at least part of the game. Not sure who should get priority.

* If pansy-Chadli shows up again I'm going to shit a brick. Siggy might be easier to push off the ball but at least he'll give an honest effort. Townsend would be ideal, as he's guaranteed to run head on against a not-as-fast Zabeleta.",0,1390893550,null,0,1390894216,0,cf0s4zl,t3_1wcrz0,t1_cf0s4zl,t3_1wcrz0,null,1432140631,12,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,12

Why does the *family* receive ~£25m? Fair enough, she now requires extra care/modifications to the house etc. But why do the family receive money at all? Why are the NHS not just picking up the bill for whatever needs doing instead of giving the family the money directly?

I think compensation from the NHS should be limited to ~1m/per person/for life. The NHS is a good system, you get (basically) free healthcare no matter what. I think it should work like so;

NHS = Free, limited compensation. NHS picks up the bill for any care required as a result of negligence anyway.
Private = no limit on compensation.

In both situations the person responsible should be held accountable and suffer the consequences for the rest of their life. Why should the doctor get away from being negligent? She should be coughing up too.

Lloris, Walker and Rose are obvious decisions right now.

In the midfield, I would love for us to continue with 5 midfielders. Bentaleb has been playing well, but I will be fucking pissed if he starts this game and it's not really a knock on him, but Sherwood needs to understand that City are about as good as it gets. We will be over run in the midfield if we set out with Bentaleb and Dembele. Hopefully we go with Dembele in a box-to-box role with a defensive midfielder sitting in front of the CBs and Eriksen in an attacking role.

On the wings, I'd love to see Lamela on the right, but we all know that that won't happen. I'm expecting Lennon. The left will be a random choice of Sigurdsson, Chadli and Townsend. And up front will obviously be Adebayor. He's in form, but there's no telling if he'll come out motivated or not. We can only hope that he will, especially facing an old club.

true,TheMania,null,null,"No, the pre EZ examples *do not show that*.

For one, they're 10yr bonds - not short term. Governments have no need to issue long term bonds, they can fund themselves purely on short term at a rate set by the central bank, the implications of which are discussed [here](http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/pn_11_02.pdf). Most governments *do* issue both, but you're always going to pay a premium for borrowing over a longer term (more unknowns).

For two, it does not show what rates each central bank is targeting. If the central bank says the government should pay 8% on short-term borrowing, by golly, it's going to pay it. My point is that the central bank sets interest rates for currency-issuing governments, not ""the market"", and that a government will therefore always have a queue of people looking to lend it money.

For three, many of those currencies were not free floating but rather pegged, to aid in the swap over. If you have a exchange rate fixed with another currency you may as well be borrowing that other currency itself for all the good it'd do you.

I'm currently studying about water management/have seen some case studies on how we've managed water and it's pretty shocking some of the treatment the rivers etc have to put up with - often being seen as an unlimited resource rather than a finite supply which needs to be sustainably used. 

The issue really is just how we view certain parts of our environment, and water isn't really respected in the way it should be as Rivers are surprisingly important - same as wetlands etc which really help reduce the risk of flooding, but the focus is often on £ over not on preserving the 'green' areas and natural flood defences that are in place. 

Unfortunately until the majority of people get over the stigma that looking after the environment is a 'Green' 'Hippie' thing or whatever, and not a mainstream idea, we aren't going to be able to put the knowledge of what the environment actually does for us into practical play. One way to do this is to start attaching financial value to the land, rivers etc so that any use or mis-use of them is treated like it would be for any other 'asset' - but even this is riddled with complex issues.

Because fetching content from multiple sources will have different latencies. Fetching all your content from a single source will mean everything ""arrives"" at the same time, giving a better overall user experience.

How many times you load a webpage, and it stays white because he's pulling content from Google analytics, Facebook likes, Zopim chat app and all the myriad other 3rd party things. And ask yourself what happens when just *one* of those 3rd party things doesn't load. Invariably your page hangs for 10 seconds.

It's true, once they've loaded it once, it's in their own browser cache, so no more problem.

Well if you have a monopoly, which you established during a time there was no real valid competition you can behave in (illegal) anticompetitive ways (lobbying governments helps too..) to ensure competition *cannot* exist.

You know Microsoft make more money from Android (an open source system) than their own shitty Windows phone ? This is an example of anti-competitive actions

For a really good outline as to why Microsoft have kept their stranglehold read the Halloween documents

http://thevarguy.com/open-source-application-software-companies/halloween-documents-microsofts-anti-linux-strategy-15-yea

Its about keeping power and preventing competition rather than making a better product.

Most of the features people like in Windows Vista / 7 were pretty much stolen from KDE (an opensource desktop) - i.e the menu, widgets, etc

Its not just Google that think of them as anticompetitive

true,BigRedS,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; Chromium and chrome are based on the same code - only Chrome 'phones home' and had flash built in (the only way to get the latest on Linux) - Chrome is more open source rather than not.
&gt; 
&gt; The same goes for mobile OS's - Linux is winning. - i.e Android .

Android is not open sauce in most forms (if it's got any of the Googly bits - half the point of GPS is to avoid having to free much of the useful stuff). Claiming that Linux is winning because of Android is a bit like claiming *BSD is gaining becase of OSX.

&gt; &gt;  How would the proprietary ecosystem still exist were buying their products always to be such an obviously economically costly option?
&gt; 
&gt; Well if you have a monopoly, which you established during a time there was no real valid competition you can behave in (illegal) anticompetitive ways (lobbying governments helps too..) to ensure competition cannot exist.

Right, so that's presumably how you reckon MS make money. What of, say IBM? Why does anyone buy AutoCAD, WebSphere or VMWare?

&gt; You know Microsoft make more money from Android (an open source system) than their own shitty Windows phone ? This is an example of anti-competitive actions

Personally, here I blame the game and the other players at least as much as the trolls. Nobody's actually challenged these patents in court, except Barnes Noble who ended up in some apparently-sepearate agreement with MS.

&gt; Most of the features people like in Windows Vista / 7 were pretty much stolen from KDE (an opensource desktop) - i.e the menu, widgets, etc

All the DEs copy features from all the others. The same is true of basically all software - all the features in OOo were 'stolen' from MSOffice and those from WordPerfect and Lotus, and those probably from what came before. Let's not pretend KDE was relevant even around the time Vista was released. And, really, let's not pretend there's a free DE that's not awful.

&gt; Its not just Google that think of them as anticompetitive

No, it's also their competition. MS *is* competetive in most of the markets in which it competes with Google; it has no monopoly on web services, for example. I do hope you're not suggesting Google as some ethically-superior alternative to MS.

&gt; I hate the fact that I am FORCED to fund Microsoft via tax when better alternatives exist - at least if tax payers were funding opensource companies the improvements would help all of mankind.

You're also 'forced' to fund RedHat, Novell, IBM, Intel and other sponsors of the kernel because Government also buys from them. Your complaint is not that the the Government does not use Open Source (it cannot be, since it does) and not, apparently, even that it uses some closed-source software (most of the costs of IT would go into producing very much proprietary software anyway), but specifically that it uses MS software?

You're not agreeing with me on that point there, as your solution here is a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.

Suggesting that guns have to be kept at the clubs only to offset the risk of their owners using them in crimes is no different to the Daily Mail suggesting GTA5 should only be played in official Government centres with psychologists around watching to offset the risk of people turning into serial killers after playing these ""murder simulators""; you're proposing a solution to a problem that simply doesn't exist.

&gt;so I took a screenshot of the foreword I mentioned in my argument.

Thanks for that. Although it doesn't mention what would need to be used in order to breach it in a minute. If you get a chance to look at a gun safe, you'll see they are heavy as hell, and very tough. I don't know if this ""one minute"" stat is using the heaviest tools, or anything. I'd be interested to see what they used.

&gt;For the stats against guns: here.

The Australian and the American situation are a million miles away from what the UK situation regarding firearm laws. They are incomparable, really. Nobody is proposing a system where I could walk into a gun shop and buy a pistol after a background check and use it for self defence. It also commits a big logical fallacy too of implied causation. America has not had any terrorist attacks since the Patriot Act. Does this in itself prove the Patriot Act stopped any terrorist attacks happening? No, of course it doesn't.

Yet, this is the logic this article is using.

&gt;not from jobs! Jesus, as though we'd make the guns in the UK!

Even though we do make guns in the UK, I'm talking about gun shops, the actual legal firearms sales, ammunition sales and private ranges. Plus, we also won't have the absolutely barmy situation where out Olympic athletes have to go out the country to train.

&gt;That data I just linked is what i was talking about for data going either way.

Only because it's talking about a firearms system that doesn't exist in the UK, nor is anyone calling for it. The system we *do* have, has made legal firearms practically a zero threat to the public.

&gt;but I still would never vote to relax such laws.

As long as you acknowledge that your position isn't based in reason or evidence, but on knee-jerk fear, making it no better than the aforementioned ""ban murder-simulator computer games"" or ""ban rock music"".

&gt;rather than a paranoid ""shit I better get a gun, everyone else might have one"" society.

Again, this is absolutely *not* the system we have, or are asking for. Self defence is not a valid reason for getting a firearm (remember you must give good reason for getting *each* firearm on a FAC), nor do we want it to be. This is not a scenario that would or could happen.",0,1390902259,null,0,1390919425,0,cf0tsc5,t3_1w1kdt,t1_cf0tsc5,t1_cf0efgm,null,1432141369,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Selling her flat may be a drastic option given that in most places it's a good investment - is she in a position to rent it out to supplement her income? Also that way if as you say it doesn't work out she is able to move back in at a months notice (at least in England/Wales, not sure about Scotland). If she does rent it out, try to encourage her not to let it out to a friend while she's in this situation, as they can be slack with payments, or she might want to charge them less than she would someone else. Maybe her dad could ""take charge"" of the apartment (just as an agreement, not in name/law) ? Guess it depends how willing he is to get involved.

Short term she will have to deal with the debt collectors, it's not the end of the world. They will work out a repayment plan - remember in the end they just want money, not to make her bankrupt.

And of course, prioritise repayments for the highest interest items first (so this means unfortunately Dad is last in the queue).

True. That was uncalled for. But so was physically assaulting him.

Lets play a game of hypothetical scenario.

There's a cyclist riding on the pavement, which is illegal. They're blocking pedestrians and posing a hazard by being in the space allocated to pedestrians.

A pedestrian who is almost struck by the bike calls the cyclist a fucking prick for their dangerous behaviour, so the cyclist speeds up. The pedestrian sprints after the bike to reiterate his point.

The cyclist stops, dismounts and punches the pedestrian.

Now, should the pedestrian have sworn and run after the cyclist?
Probably not.

Does this absolve the cyclist of their illegal action and physical assault?
Definitely not.

If this actually happened, there would be outcry over the actions of the 'bloody cyclist' being a law unto themself and attacking someone for calling them out on it. People would praise the attacked pedestrian for their courage and being a shining beacon of reason in a world gone mad.

So why, in this instance, is the cyclist being lambasted as much as, if not more than, the occupant of the car?

Stopping in an ASL Zone is illegal and carries a three point penalty and a £100 fine. The Audi driver broke the law, as hundreds of drivers do each day, endangering the lives of other road users for the sake of 3 metres of convenience.

Yes, the cyclist's reaction was unpleasant and over the top. But if I can ride for 30 minutes and see 10 ASLs occupied by cars, who often give me abuse for moving in front of them, then I can easily believe that this was the final straw for the cyclist.

The time to strengthen was now. This window.

After all the Summer debacle with Luis wanting to leave etc, this window provided opportunity to progress.
I have to blame this transfer committee rather than Brendan himself. The courting of Salah, for weeks even months was like watching a satirical bunch of idiots akin to David Brent's The Office. The dilly dallying meant Chelsea snatched our target and now with four days left, teams around us have stolen a march. You just have to look at how quick Chelsea acted over signing Salah. I highly doubt they were perusing him for as long as us, yet they made a bid had it accepted and signed him within a matter of days.
God forbid we miss out on top four, it will be this transfer window and this transfer committee which we will all look back on and blame. There seems to be a lack of aggression and decisiveness within this transfer committee.

But there are some really fucking insidious things there like:

Clauses 58-61 - Where whoever makes a legislative decision has to take into account the economic effects of said legislation -because, you know, we're all slaves to money now!

Paragraphs 444-447 - If a local authority does a test and finds the air quality in an area is fucking bad, this would remove the obligation for the local authority to continue to test the air quality in that area. This caught my attention because if I recall correctly DECC are sitting on an air quality report for london that is pretty much expected to say that London's air officially takes a decade off your lifespan.

Paragraph 457: Apparently removing the requirement for schools in england to hire a teacher or headteacher with a teaching qualification - or the alternative interpretation is that it removes the requirement for a school to hire a teacher with ANY qualification at all. 

Paragraphs 477-79 - Removing the requirement for a school to make reports (Ofsted, Religious Inspections and investigations about complaints made about the school) publicly available, and instead to anyone who asks for one and registered parents. A cynical bastard like myself would say that actually, doing this means that if you request one, it can get ""lost in the paperwork"" for a long period of time.

Paragraph 522-523 - Removal of the requirement for the secretary of state to consult when fire or rescue services merge under their own initiative. Again, a cynical bastard might say that this probably means a lot of fire services are going to have their budgets cut again.

Clause 2 - Removal of employment tribunals ability to make further recommendations - As far as I can make out, this basically means that instead of ET's being able to suggest changes in the law or changes to standards in industry, this revision would only apply at the company subject to the ET. This is pretty bad.

Clause 47 - The removal of the duty of a local authority to involve local representatives when doing a consultation or involvement on the grounds that **""local authorities should be trusted to engage with local people without a duty being imposed on them to do so.""** Fucking hilarious.

Clause 44 - Repeal of local authorities to have a sustainable community strategy - Basically removes the obligation to have some kind of environmentally friendly initiative or plans to work towards.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; Now let's say that in Country X it costs £6,000 a year in order to have a basic standard of living

Which is the start of the flaws in the assumption.

When I graduated from uni, I couldn't believe the wage I was going to be getting, it was about 3 times what I'd earned before.  I had to move to London, so I watched a huge amount of that just disappear in rent, I wasn't being extravagant.  There was the dress code, the cost of the commute, all of a sudden my basic costs started to rise.  I used to be a master economy chief with my friends, my food budget was meagre but every sunday roast turned into curries, casseroles, pies, palous etc.  Suddenly I was working too longer hours to be eating with anyone I knew, that really increased my spending.  I wanted to buy an expensive new game, and I realised I had less money left over from my first big paycheque, than my last lifestyle.

I also found I needed about £500 in text books to keep up with knowledge that I'd somehow bluffed my way through so far with.

I guess I am saying that the cost of basic standard of living varies wildly.  Plenty of high paying jobs require high paying commitments.

One of the reasons I don't like our current progressive taxation, is places like London, you will have a much lower quality of life on say £28k, than you would in Cornwall on £18k.  Yet you will be being taxed considerably more, as you will be in a higher bracket.

My parents pay the same council tax on a huge house (5+ bedrooms), in Cornwall where it costs more to deliver key services) that I pay for a tiny flat.  Actually mine is very slightly more.

If we were going to be really progressive, we would have different bands for different people.  One of the main reasons I was so in favour of raising the personal allowance, I just can't imagine how hard it must be for people who are wanting to have a better than student quality of life on £10k in London.

Rocinha is built on a steep hillside overlooking Rio de Janeiro, and is located about one kilometre from a nearby beach. Most of the favela is on a very steep hill, with many trees surrounding it. 69,161 (census 2010) people live in Rocinha, making it the most populous favela in Brazil.

&gt;Although Rocinha is technically classified as a neighborhood, many still refer to it as a favela. It developed from a shanty town into an urbanized slum. Today, almost all the houses in Rocinha are made from concrete and brick. Some buildings are three and four stories tall and almost all houses have basic sanitation, plumbing, and electricity. Compared to simple shanty towns or slums, Rocinha has a better developed infrastructure and hundreds of businesses such as banks, medicine stores, bus lines, cable television, including locally based chan ...

You're right, as long as you **do not** create any formal financial connection between yourself and her (that means no joint bank account, no joint mortgage, no joint credit cards, no marriage, no joint bills) she will have no impact on your credit rating. The only time people impact others credit ratings is when they're connected through a financial institution, address doesn't matter.

StepChange is one of the best debt advice charities that you can get in touch with ([their website](http://www.stepchange.org/)), but I think that you have the right idea: she should sell her property to get out her equity and pay off the debts because interest is going to making the problem so much worse.

Having more ephemeral communications is a great thing for children.  The shit I wrote on the internet when I was a kid under many different aliases are thankfully un-correlated and no one knows it was me.

Facebook and Myspace before it created this writing directly about yourself, without people realising the immutability of any thing posted.

Children will bully, it is a case of them learning to understand what is acceptable and what isn't, a way of them getting the social positions they want.  Children are by definition learning about their bodies, their chemical urges, the fact it might seem like a really good idea to send that photo, until the *euphoria* wears off.  This just isn't any different from what when I was in primary school and someone had their paints pulled down, it's a shitty situation for the person involved, it's just the medium that has changed.

Some kids will want to send their nakedness to someone to illicit a response, some will want to see how many people they can get to flash them, others will then want to brag about it.   Breaking out of SnapChat isn't exactly hard.

Telling kids that they can loose access to their phones for distributing child pornography if they forward a snapchat image or similar.

For the summer window, I think it's fine to give the manager a lot of responsibility over signings, but for January if I was the owner I'd rather keep the manager focused on winning matches every week. They're a crucial person to involve in the transfer process but I think it's a bit much to expect them to do all the work on top of their day-to-day stuff.

Because it's a planning tariff. Architects barely know the NBS standards let alone planning. I wouldn't expect builders to know anything about either topic.

Strong property law is an integral part of the UK and it's history. It is important to be very clear on these matters as any ambiguity of language can and do lead to expensive legal quagmires. The Party Wall Act just takes the historical property laws and removes a bunch of ambiguity from them. It is a fiddly piece of legislation in the sense that it mostly clarifies existing legislation and ties up loose ends but the net benefit of not having legal proceedings for these increasingly common situations vastly outweighs the administrative drag.

true,digitalpencil,eng-manchester,Manchester,"You're missing the point. Universities are businesses and students, clients. Cambridge is one of the most prestigious businesses of its type, in the world. It has attained this reputation for prestige through its high barrier for entry (only the smartest and most motivated candidates gain entry to a university like Cambridge).

With this prestige comes certain requirements; a preserved, historical legacy and a gentlemen's agreement that those who prosper at a university of this type, will go on to much greater things.

All businesses require funding. In the case of universities, much of this funding is garnered through fees, (students pay a set fee to attend that establishment) however this isn't the only source of funding. Funding is also acquired by nurturing the reputation of both the university, its alumni and fellows. Holding dinners for example, replete with the finest finishings to which its clientele are accustomed, are requisite parts of fund-raising through donations and its investment businesses. Any high-profile company would not hold a dinner for its esteemed representatives and clients, and serve up Lambrini. Cambridge is no exception to this.

I understand your reservation. The political elite are being wined and dined while the lower class are struggling to survive. It's a legitimate concern but a national economy is significantly more complex than the tallying of educational institution's expense accounts. All these things are about one thing, ROI. These events garner a higher return over their investment. If they didn't, they wouldn't hold them.

If you have the cash for it take a few lessons on the bike after you are comfortable on it go for it, it will make you safer on the road.

* MC JMou has entered the building.

* Champaign has been provided by Mourinho. He had a nice quiet sunday dinner.

* We are improving a lot. Doesn't think we will win this season but will in the future.

* Played well against Stoke, a good 1-0. Team is playing well.

* See West Ham in trouble in the table but a hard match. They had a difficult Christmas period. The other title contenders feel the same about their opposition.

* We have to try keep the good form that we have and let things happen natural. Objective of this season is to build a team and the best way to build is to compete. We need to be top of the league, we need players to experience the Champion's league knock out.

* Next year we are going to have a strong team. Will start next season from day 1 more mature.

* ""He is not saying to win the competitions, he is saying to win the next match.""

* Juan's leave was unexpected but we answered will Salah. Matic wasn't needed for the balance of our team. Without spending more than we got we replaced two players with two players.

* Our priority this season is the future of our team. It is going well.

* Salah not eligible tomorrow. Arrives in England tomorrow.

* Torres is on schedule, Van Ginkel is doing very well.

* Unless an incredibly surprising deal happens with one of OUR players there won't be anymore transfers.

* Salah was a reaction, Matic was a big opportunity to sign a great player.

* ""Do you expect to win the league?"" ""We expect to win the next match.""

* Results are a consequence of the work and evolution.

* He thinks his players seeing him calm and comfortable will help them.

* No comment on Rooney, he is a Man United player.

* Can't see Courtois staying at Madrid.

* We have a 21 man squad with one injury which is the number we want to have. Its a squad for the future with a large number ranging between the age of 20 and 25.

* Eto'o can't be compared to John and Frank with history at the club. He is in a position for his career where he can choose to go where he wants. He doesn't need titles or money, just to enjoy himself.

They reject the measurement of this with mathematical modelling and reject the use of statistics as a means of demonstrating anything they believe to be covered by economics.

This isn't the same as evidence for the fact that humans respond to financial incentives. We have questions like; how much does the incentive scheme exist within people? Does it vary between individuals? If so, what explains this variance? Is it linear to the amount of money being offered? Does it have constraints? And many more that we would test after we provide evidence that financial incentives actually improve the quality of work people do. The book *Irrationality*, by Stuart Sutherland covers this in a good degree of detail as one of the faulty methods for reasoning that people use.

With regards to the nightlife, I have never been to a better city in the world for a night out than Liverpool, it is fantastic. There are literally hundreds of pubs, bars and clubs in what must be a 1 mile radius, you can quite easily walk from one end of town to the other and it not feel like a treck. There is a massive spectrum of what the nightlife caters too as well, so the likelihood is that whatever music you like, there will be at least a few establishments that you will frequent.

I lived in Cambridge Court and hated it, but knowing what I know now, that was down to my flatmates and their lack of social lives. The reality is that it isn't too different from any other student accommodation. From stories of friends and whatnot, Grand Central sounds like the best, it is next door to the main train station of the city (slap bang in the middle of town) and the sheer size of it means that finding a party isn't hard.

I studied History, I didn't turn up to lectures nor seminars and ended up with a 2:1, but I think that says more about the ease of the course than it does about me. Getting chased up over attendance or lack thereof doesn't seem to be a priority for the Humanities department, how that reflects on the Science department however, I have no idea.

Do I have any tips? Yes, The Raz on a Monday, you won't regret it.

Within a month we should have Sakho, Enrique &amp; Allen back. Our team will look a lot stronger then. I admit missing Lucas will hurt us at times, but I think we can adapt.

Man U have signed Mata. So what? They don't need him. They need a new CB, RB, DM/CM &amp; Striker. I don't think he'll do much for them. I don't see them as a threat.

Spurs are woefully inconsistent. They haven't signed anyone. I don't see them really threatening unless they properly start to gel. But I don't see it happening.

Everton are our only real competition, but they're plagued by injuries too with a similar sized squad - but it's also weaker. If we beat them tonight, I have a feeling that will put a serious dent in their CL hopes. 

I think, the majority of the time we can out-score teams and then it's just a matter of hoping Sakho, Agger, Enrique &amp; Allen are back before we've played all of the top 7 to hopefully allow us to win at least 4 of those matches. 

You also have to remember that Spurs &amp; Man U have Europe, which will tire their squads a fair amount. And Man U's 2 best players (and only world class ones imo, except Mata now) are injured and out for a while yet. And we're playing all of the other 6 teams at home except Man U, which should give us an edge against them.

Lloris

Walker, VladTheRad, Vertongs, Rose

Lennon, Dembele, Paulinho, Eriksen

Soldado, Ade-bade-bo-bade

Dawson is a fine player against a certain type of opponent, but he just lacks the pace to keep up with ManCity's frontline and isn't mobile enough to do much in attack -- A Vlad/Vertongs partnership would be among the strongest ball-handling CB duos in the PL, especially given the attacking strength of Walker and Rose on the flanks. Also, I know you guys are ready to write off Soldado, but he's more than proven in La Liga that he's a world-class striker. I know the sample size has grown to the point that he should have shown us more by now, but, given the investment made in him, he has to be given the time. Plus, Ade's stellar solo performance against Swans notwithstanding, they formed one hell of a partnership in the previous matches. 

BENCH: Friedel, Dawson, Naughton, Sandro, Townsend, Defoe

Fortunately/unfortunately this lineup won't all be healthy at the same time (except, perhaps, next week, when it seems EVERYONE will be back), so Lamela , Chadli, Kaboul, Bentaleb, Kane, etc. will find their way back in eventually, but it's NOT a bad thing that Capoue and Holtby (as much as I love him) are on their way out, as there's just too many players on the roster to keep happy at the moment.

&gt;No, it's a responsibility, a social contract. 

Indeed, and a responsibility that the middle class shoulder a vast proportion of.

&gt;As though the middle classes don't use the same services the poor use. 

Some of the same services.  The taxation from the middle class pays for plenty of services that few of them ever use - many of the lower income benefits spring to mind.  

&gt;As though it's some kind of benevolent gift from the better off to the rest of us

And there it is - the root of the cockishness, the classic 'them and us mentality;' fuck those middle class scumbags right?  Total reverse snobbery and class elitism.  While you're preaching this kind of shit, are you really surprised that the upper classes carry on with it too?

&gt;If the upper middle class would pay the tax they actually owed we wouldn't need food banks. 

Dream on chief, if all the tax was gathered and re-distributed, and everyone had an increased level of disposable income, in a free market economy the price of goods would just rise and re-define the poverty line.

true,pharao007,null,null,"&gt;I could say the exact same thing about martial arts and learning a one hit kill punch, or making blow dart gun from a bamboo stick from the garden centre.

Really? Comparing martial arts with firing a weapon? Are you serious?

&gt;especially by a handgun which is LESS powerful than the shotguns or rifles that are already legal and widely owned in the UK

It's obvious shotguns are more powerful but it will be always easier to conceal a small gun. That's pretty obvious as well. Right?

&gt;The kids could also access the kitchen knives, the tools in the garage, the oven, the hob or many other dangerous household items which would certainly be less secured than a firearm

Come on, are you that hard thinking? Child can hurt himself with a knife but that in the worst scenario will be a small cut. Pointing a gun at your head and just firing it will kill you instantly. How can you compare such things?

&gt;Find me a stat for children who have got into the gun safe and shot mum by accident. Until then, you're pulling this out of your arse.

I don't need stats. It's very plausible and that's what matters here. Pure likelihood tells you that 1 in x people will forget to close the cabinet, 1 in x kids would like to play with the real gun etc etc. If gun isn't around you reduce it to COMPLETE ZERO risk.

&gt;If a friend wanted me dead, he could easily do, even without a gun

With a gun it's always easier. Just look at Pistorius' case. Accidental shooting because he shot being half asleep, knowing it can be dangerous burglar and possibly being more scared than he should have been. A life was lost just because he had a gun. If he wanted to defend himself he could very well use a knife or a spray pepper or cs gas. In worst case scenario he would only hurt his girlfriend. Kind of hard to stab a person via a door.

&gt;Please try to have a more open mind. We are not America and we never will be

Since a single network adapter is useless, virtual or not, you need to have another network adapter to connect to. In theory this means you could use such a device to connect to other Virtual adapters on the same computer to simulate networks for testing software during development and such, but we're not interested in that, we want to be able to connect to another machine! So Virtual Network Adapters often have the ability to interact with real hardware network adapters. We now have a Virtual Network.

The final part of the puzzle is that sometimes you want a secure connection. Perhaps you want to access confidential information from work on your home computer, say the companies finances from a database server or the designs for something that you company works on from a file server. Since you don't want this information to be compromised by having somebody ""phone tap"" your internet connection, you want this connection to be completely private. To accomplish this you can use an extra step on your Virtual Network to add encryption, so all the information is encrypted before it leaves your computer and is decrypted as it leaves the other end of the Virtual Network. This is where the private part comes in!

In the examples before those networks are likely completely separated from the internet bar incoming connections from the VPN. Why go through all that trouble of setting up a private connection to a network where everything is publicly available? Well in the case of bypassing restriction put in place by an ISP, that is exactly what you want!

&gt; It shall be the duty of the Keeper of Public Records to arrange that reasonable facilities are available to the public for inspecting and obtaining copies of those public records in the Public Record Office **which fall to be disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000**

And then from that Act, taken from wikipedia for want of a better source.

&gt; However, there are numerous exemptions. Some of these are absolute bars to disclosure; some are qualified, which means the public authority has to decide whether the public interest in disclosing the relevant information outweighs the public interest in maintaining the exemption.

&gt; Information relating to or dealing with security matters (s.23)

&gt; Prejudice international relations (s.27)

&gt; Prejudice relations between any administration in the United Kingdom and any other such administration (s.28)

&gt; Prejudice the economic interests of the UK (s.29)

So I guess it's pretty clear cut the Government gets to decide whether something is in the public interest, and not harmful according to any of those exceptions, while I'm damn sure most of it would be *very* harmful.

So the sensationalist title is basically watered down when you realise they are not ""unlawfully hiding"" anything, and that quoting a 1958 Act while not acknowledging the provisos of a later 2000 Act just makes you look like an idiot.

I would be excessive if your children were starving

And the analogy you use is just a dishonest attempt to distort the debate; you can't compare universities to people, just like you can't compare a countries debt to a credit card. I do love though how you turned the fact that's Cambridge's *""turnover is 1.3 BILLION""* into a sympathy point. *""So 3m on wine is...Certainly not excessive.""* So if a billionaire bought 5 islands that wouldn't be excessive if it only represented 5% of his turnover, 5% would be like buying a fridge for a normal person on 30K, hardly excessive…..we can all use statistics to murky the waters.

of course it's linked to the living wage. Employees not getting the living wage literally means they don't earn enough to live on. It's not a case of lack of money if this is the wine budget, so it's just a case of priorities. 

Not to mention Cambridge is still a public university, *""and it was reported that approximately one third of Cambridge's income comes from UK government funding for teaching and research, with another third coming from other research grants.""* The tax payer is funding for this extravagance despite the conditions of not only its own workers, but the people in society as a whole. Cambridge University is the richest educational institution in Europe, this kind of spending is symbolic of their amazing wealth. But of course if these workers went on strike demanding better pay, the sheeple would react as trained with ‘greedy workers’ or ‘disrupting education’, this society really need to start re-thinking its priorities.

It does though.  As does teaching experience.

Not directly, of course.  But a principal that doesn't understand the core business of a University is going to have great difficulty persuading the academics to go along with whatever reforms they want to make.  Moreover, it only takes one slip up before someone with no experience is written off.

Whereas, someone with actual experience in teaching and research will be given a certain latitude to prove themselves; and may be forgiven a mistake or two if the case for it was reasonable.

I've seen it time and again - someone with no experience in teaching nor research brought in to a university, (usually as a 'project manager' or similar title), and tries to change operational thing that affect the professors.  First slip up, which usually doesn't take long [0], and they loose any co-operation, and generally can't get anything done.  Or, if it gets forced through against the wishes of the professors, then the prof's pack up their labs and move.

Not all of them, of course; only the ones you _want_.   All of those have standing offers from other universities, and if you mess then around, you'll find that they are extremely mobile.  I've seen some ill thought through changes result in 3 professors leaving a university.  That's 10% of the universities total research income, right there, gone [1].

So, yes, it _really is_ important, to the key mobile staff, that the person running a university is, or rather, has been, an academic.

&gt;and could earn a lot more than they do as lecturers, but they choose to research and teach rather than cash in on their knowledge

actually no, no they couldn't. About 90% of university lectures rely on the university, how many jobs do you think there are for history professors outside history departments? Nearly all of those who work in the art subjects and many of the sciences wouldn't be able to do what they do without the university.

Lets think about some positives: 
- We have a favorable fixture list
- A lot of the negativity is coming from comparisons with other clubs around us on the table. Why though? Ultimately there is the whole league we are competing against...(its our points tally vs. points required for fourth, simple as that).
-Most of our bad games have been when we have not had our first team back four. Enrique has been injured for a long time, Agger has been out a lot and even Sakho has been injured). 
- Lack of depth does not have to be a problem. ""Lack of depth"" is a bit of a buzzword in football circles but I think that the problem is more complex than that. Do we have to get injured? That are not actually ""inevitable"" (shock, horror)...in fact I think we had a comparatively better run last year with injuries. 
- Add to this that, apart from an odd FA cup game, we should have a more spaced out schedule than nearly all the teams around us. 
- Lucas' injury is a problem but it will be a good test for Rodgers as a manager. I personally think he is the most valuable player in the team (with regards to how we play) but no one player should be able to completely deny CL hopes. Rodgers will have to change things, look for solutions (he's already started with Gerrard) and perhaps he will LEARN things.
- As for the long term, Suarez leaving this summer is not inevitable. And even if it does happen, no one player can make that much of a difference. Furthermore, from the form he's been in and the fact that has long term deal with us, the transfer fee should be delicious.
- AND...if that happens then Rodgers can continue to build the squad in the way that he desires...In Rodgers We Trust.

I wanted advice more than anything, where can I go now, what are my options, where's a good place to get experience etc. My uni provided a lot of help while I was there, but I figured if I wanted a job in my hometown, I'd be worth talking to the job specialists in my home town, see what they can offer. Plus they gave me money. 

They did not have anything to offer for me at all, which is my point. They printed out a list of every job in a 20 mile radius, told me to apply for them. Of course, for some people that would be really useful, but for me it wasn't. There was nothing there that I didn't already know. My problem with finding paid work was due to lack of experience, I'd never had a job and these days it's what employers want. 

The Jobcenter then sent me on a course to teach me how to do a CV, how to tailor it and how to apply for jobs. My CV is fucking impeccable (I'm not a confident person, but I'm very confident with my formal writing and communication, it took me years to realise it and it was my lecturer who helped build my confidence, thanks, Paul!). I know how to tailor it, how to word my cover letters, what to say in interviews etc. I've spent five years practicing it, in uni I had prep for graduate interviews, having to do big presentations and stuff, I'm very confident in my ability to apply for jobs.  I left that class after two hours because it was a waste of time and I was humiliated and insulted by the woman teaching the class, I went home in tears, feeling like shit. I should have filed a complaint looking back, but I just wanted to avoid that place so never did. When you're already stressed and anxious, it's no fun. 

Ended up finding a job myself, I also know where to go for volunteering to start incorporating my degree and I know what I'm doing when I'm ready for it.

I think we're actually on the same page with this issue. 

I will say it again; don't think that research credentials are essential to run a university but I don't disagree that understanding academia is a vital part of the organisation. I'm not saying that because someone has run large organisation they will be able to run any large organisation, just that being a professor does not give skills that transfer to running a university. Do you see the distinction I'm making here?

I think that this is a problem, in general, with management of large organisations where the key people are not consulted or listened to as part of the decision making process. I feel that the academics should have far more democratic say in decision making - even up to the point of hiring the vice chancellor.

What I can't understand is how people can clearly be given bonuses for what they've done in the same calendar year, when the problems they cause further down the line aren't taken into account. The people who caused these issues, in many cases have fucked off with the bonuses they earned that year, and are laughing.

I think bankers bonuses should be deferred a few years (5? 10?) before they can be paid, and possibly paid in shares, so if the company tanks 3 years after they make a huge profit, due to their incompetence, they don't make any money.

true,notsurewhatdayitis,eng-yorkshire,East Yorkshire,"Two options:

1) Norwich &amp; Peterborough BS: The Norwich &amp; Peterborough BS Gold Classic current account has 0% overseas spending fees and no cash withdrawal fee worldwide. You need to pay in £500 a month (£6,000 salary) or keep £5,000 in the account to avoid its £5/mth fee.

If you don't want to change bank accounts then you're looking at a Credit Card and actually this shouldn't cost much more. 

2) Halifax Clarity Credit Card. No loading fees, no currency conversion fees within Europe nor charges on cash withdrawals from ATMs however you'll pay interest on cash from the moment you withdraw it, even if you repay the balance in full. Whilst this sounds bad, the APR for cash withdrawls is 12.9% APR so effectively 1% a month. So if you withdraw £500 a the beginning of the month to give you enough cash to see you through the month for the spending you can't do on the credit card, you'll pay £5 interest unless you pay it off before the next bill. That is a shitload less than what you'd get hammered by many banks for cash withdrawals abroad where the ATM fee is typically 1.5%-3% per withdrawal for ATM withdrawals abroad with a poor currency conversion rate as well.

So the way you work it with the credit card is do as much spending on the credit card as you can rather than cash. As there are no charges for using ATMs, withdraw cash as you need it to minimise the interest you'll pay. Pay the balance in full every month from your regular UK bank account.

The problem is, you either have to bullshit or risk getting sanctioned.  

I could easily work my arse off to find work in a week (which I did and now I work) and the total time it took to do so would be nowhere near 35 hours.  

You also have to log-in to Universal Job Match every single day, or you could risk getting sanctioned for having a day where you didn't, even if the total time logged on your profile hit 35 hours for that week.  

On top of that, sanctions are given out not just for legitimate reasons, but from drawing from a hat too, to meet quotas. I was sanctioned last summer for ""Not looking for work"" despite showing that I had applied for 30-40 different jobs every week and I had 2 job interviews coming up.

We have Universal Credit here now, not JSA.  

Here are the differences I can remember off the top of my head:  

- Benefits are paid monthly instead of every two weeks.  

- You don't sign-off if you find employment. Benefit calculations are now based on income rather than the hours you work in a week (which means you no longer sign-off just because you do X amount of hours a week of work).  

- Going off from that, I signed-off, but I could have technically stayed on it, receiving £10 a month in benefits because my benefit cap was £320 a month but my part-time job pays £310 a month. I signed-off because I can't be arsed going through it all just for a tenner. (I don't think the maths actually works like that as they use percentages, but it's the same concept).  
 

- Answer to your question: Contracts depend on your situation. Going off from 35 hours a week: if you work or do voluntary work for 15 hours a week, your contract changes to ""Spend 20 hours a week looking for work"" (35-15)  

The last point is why I signed-off even though I could have stayed on. I am contracted to 12 hours a week at Sainsbury's and this Friday is my first day at University studying for a PGDE.

This could be a strategy that works against City because we'll be able to slow up Toure and Fernandinho.

true,kmjhawk,null,null,"I didnt downvote you, but it's probably the pessimistic and shite attitude. 

Going devil's advocate here for the conservative approach of FSG because they dont have an oil tree in their backyard that spews unlimited money.

Let's look at Stewart Downing. We splashed 20 million for him estimated.

Say we drop 20 million on a Downing 2.0 clone this time around, hypothetically. From experience of our last Downing, I'd say that wasn't a great buy. He wasn't a 20 million quid talent. But, say we strengthened the squad by paying 8 million for the BPL experienced lad. I'd say, even though he wasnt a great player, for squad depth and talent above replacement, he was okay. And I think FSG would be okay with that as well. 

The fact of the matter is, just because you can spend the money, doesnt mean you should. Would a Downing clone really be 20 million better than waiting for an Ibe to come back? I'd be willing to say maybe 7 or 8 million better, and thats where the valuations come in. 

Salah is another example. I can believe Chelski paid 11 million straight up with bonuses that did reach the 16 million mark. So to get his signature we would have had to believe that Salah was 16 million better than Moses or Ibe (Whichever winger you want to compare to). Did they? Maybe. They believed he was a talent with potential (3 months of scouting), but possibly not enough talent to make an effect on the XI to get us to the CL. We're not really sure. There's stories that say he never even wanted to come here. 

At the end of the day, if we dont make a move, damn right it will be disappointing. But, a 20 million dollar player can set you back (Downing, Carroll) just as quick as it can spring you forward (Suarez, Sturridge, Sakho). So for a club without a wallet full of oil, I can respect not knee jerk buying Downing 2.0.

I was clarifying your implied statement that ""they have no evidence"". I'm not taking a position, I'm informing. If you read the actual law ([section 10.1 and 10.2](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/23/crossheading/consultation-requirements/enacted#section-6-9)), to be given a TPIM the government and police must have the evidence that the individual would be convicted if they used the evidence in open Court and must have the view to prosecute when the [perceived] risk no longer exists.

They *need to have the evidence, but they are not willing to use it in Court*. Whether that's right or wrong, I'm not debating. You have completely missed what I was saying and taken it as an attack on your beliefs (unless you believe the law does not say they need evidence), which is ""utter bollocks"".

You could possibly argue that you have paid £250 for each car and demand them at that price because in court, you've given your half of the contract and they've not. That way, you'd either be due two cars at no more than £500 or due your money back + losses.

He may have gotten his chance due to not having other options and how shitty Cissokho is but he took it aplomb and is making a huge shout for more time due to his good performances.  I think he looks hungry and ready to make that step to being a regular with the senior squad.

That said, I think understand the point you're trying to make and I tend to agree, overall I don't think our other youth (except Sterling... we'll see how Suso looks to fit in once he comes back from his loan) is ready to take that next step.  Our youth will not be the answer in the midfielder. Rossiter is going to be a big talent but he's just 16 years old, he's not even close to being ready to make a big contribution to guiding us back into the champion's league.  Maybe in 5 years he will be, but he's a fucking child right now.  The holes in our squad aren't able to be filled by younger players because we don't have any that are currently on the brink or showing signs of being near to ready.  I think BR is constantly paying close attention to our young stars in the academy and reserves, he loves giving them some experience and getting them involved with the senior side when possible.

true,pharao007,null,null,"I really don't mind when people shoot for a sport at the range. When they shoot animals because it's required and approved requirement to do that (for example hurt animals, pests and etc) it's obviously fine. 

I don't find it funny when a person shoots a deer or other animal only for the ""fun"" part. If that animal doesn't have to die why kill it? Fishing is a bit different as firstly we shouldn't really compare a fish with for example a deer. Secondly, it's not as direct as with shooting (you just put a bait in the water and fish gets it). We live in civilised world, where you can buy meat at the shop, no reason to shoot a deer just to have some deer meat.

The whole problem lies with the approach here. It's not that ""I have to do it"", it's ""I like to do it in that particular way"". It's quite obvious that shooting is much less humane and is strongly connected with that whole approach of hurting a human/animal being and crime/wars as well.

P.S. Why not ""shoot"" animals with pictures? I remember there was a guy who even invented such weapon. Instead of firing a bullet, it made a cute picture of a deer. You have all the fun of being outside, of tracking an animal and even aiming at it with a shoot... which doesn't kill.

There's a lot of nonsense spouted (from both the press and normal people) about how much power you need, and how much is needed to be fun. Here's the kicker - 25BHP is enough for anything in the UK. In Europe, with their 85MPH motorway speed limits (and the inevitable speeding on those roads, just like here), you might need 40BHP if you're loaded up with camping gear or you and your pillion are obese.

In this country having a lot more power doesn't even necessarily make overtaking easier, you're still limited by not being able to see through hedges or trees or there is just too much traffic coming the other way. Just think about it, is all.

Personally once I read Twist Of The Wrist and learnt that I was getting many things wrong I greatly enjoyed my time on my GS125 learning to ride the wheels off it. How people can say it is boring is beyond me, there's far more to do on a 125 than on a bigger bike. And who cares about straight line speed anyway, there are too many police and cameras for that, the real kicks are in the corners when the rear starts to shimmy wide and you put your weight on the inside footpeg to try and stabilise it while maybe shifting your bum off the seat.. I often wish I'd never sold my 125 but I listened to the usual idiots and thought I had to move up the ladder. It's not true.

Edit: Ah the ol' downvotes with no counter arguments routine, so classy. I wonder how many of you have ridden a bike with 25BHP?

This is approximately twice the Slovak average annual gross wage. The tax increase applies to the top 5% of PIT taxpayers. Another feature was the introduction of negative income tax for low-income taxpayers. There was also a reintroduction of reduced VAT rates, one at 10% that applied to books and pharmaceuticals, the other at 6% that applied to a rather obscure group of homemade agricultural products.

true,ctp95,lfc55,,"I think the change has to be two-fold. The first point is to reestablish a top-tier team mentality. Obviously Liverpool has had a few lean years recently in terms of results, but we're still one of the biggest and most storied clubs in all of Europe and we need to start acting like it. It is totally, totally unacceptable to me that the Mancs were able to sign a player like Juan Mata despite very deservedly sitting mid-table and having what we might generously call a slim chance of CL for next year. Those are the types of players we need to be going after. We need a new midfielder? Go try and sign Arturo Vidal, or Reus, or Kroos. I'm not saying that we must sign those players, but signal intent and put in a legitimate bid. There is zero, zero understandable reason for Juan Mata to be playing for United apart from them being willing to spend the money to secure him. It makes my fucking blood boil when I see rumours about Moyes lining up a summer sweep for Bayern or Dortmund midfielders, or Chelsea just snapping Nemanja Matic back up like it's their goddamned birthright. We need to cement an ambitious, positive mentality with regards to recruiting top players. 

The second thing is to be more decisive. You want Willian? Sign him and sign him now. Same with Salah. Mkhitaryan is a different instance because he chose to go to a confirmed CL club, but Ayre, Rodgers et al need to be aware that the vultures are circling. If Chelsea or City or whoever see Liverpool coming in for a player they want, they will up their bid immediately. The deep pockets and CL status of these teams instantly makes it harder for us to sign these players, so quick and decisive action is a must. 

This squad is not far off being a permanent fixture in the top 4 of the Prem, but it's built on sand in the sense that it will all come crashing down if Suarez leaves. Failing to improve crucial areas now because of a lack of decisiveness or small-minded mentality is beyond unacceptable. I can live with finishing 7th, or getting thrashed at the Etihad or the Bridge. Those things are unpleasant but they happen in football. What I can't live with is a lack of desire from the management and operations teams when the players are so clearly giving it their all on the pitch.

true,TheMania,null,null,"&gt; Your version is along the lines of making everyone in the UK rich by printing each one a million pounds.

Not at all. I just believe that the government is limited by the real resources available to it, and *not* by how many pounds it can tax.

Let me explain the difference.

I believe that when the economy's at capacity, the government cannot non-inflationary increase its spending without forcing the private+foreign sectors to spend less, either through higher interest rates (central bank managed demand) or through higher taxes. That when the economy's at capacity, even if the government magically found 1bn pounds that it had not previously accounted for, it could not spend them without the effect being inflationary (and/or the inflation targeting Bank of England lifting rates, to reduce private sector spending) - for the economy's already at capacity.

Similarly I believe when the economy's below capacity, the government can spend more without lifting taxes. That there's resources going idle, and that it can mobilise them without it being inflationary. That is, I believe firms sooner expand than increase prices when faced with increased demand, such as from newly employed government workers, because if they attempt to put up prices when they can easily expand they'll just lose market share to those that do the opposite.

What you and the government tell me though is that there's circumstances, such as today, where there's millions of people unemployed but the government has to *cut* spending, because if it tried to spend more it'd be unable to find people or banks (which can borrow pounds for 0% interest) willing to loan it pounds for low rates. That today, despite having millions of hours of potential labour going to waste every week, there's little the government can do to mobilise them because it has run out of pounds. I say phooey.

The government has *not* run out of pounds, and all we'd see for deliberately higher deficits today is higher growth, lower unemployment, and improved wealth distribution.

&gt; You can print more for a while and it will appear to work, but in the end people will opt out.

If you don't want to print more, just do like Japan. Borrow more. The government is not going to find a shortage of people willing to loan it its currency, and if you believe otherwise I have a trade to [recommend you](http://blogs.reuters.com/breakingviews/2011/06/06/japans-widow-maker-bond-trade-still-looks-lethal/).",0,1390928988,null,0,false,0,cf10qnx,t3_1w9wbh,t1_cf10qnx,t1_cf0w10d,null,1432144967,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

b) It's fundamentally not your problem. I get that you care about her, but her Dad cares about her and has spent £10k trying to help her, only to make her debt problems deeper. The fact that she's ignoring the minimum amount is deeply worrying. You can't save her if she doesn't want to be saved. 

c) You shouldn't have the burden of her needing to move in with you in order to pay down her debt. If you want to do that anyway, cool, but if you want her to move out in the future, that's your prerogative. It's a burden to put on a relationship. Don't get sucked into anything you don't want to because of someone else's mistakes.

d) Speak to the debt collectors. Speak to the bank. You should be able to get lower interest rates than credit cards. Usually pay down the most expensive (in terms of interest rates) debt first.

e) Her house isn't really an asset if she has debt. If you owe £25k and own £25k, on balance you don't *really* own the £25k. Set up a loan repayment plan with a budget, and then work out whether in 5 or 10 years time, she'd have saved more from not paying rent than she would have paid in interest while paying off these loans.

Correct you can ride anything upto 125cc with a CBT, Dual carriage ways are fine but no motorways on a provisional license. 

To get a full license you can do a bike test, depending on your age you can do restricted or unrestricted (A1 and A2)

Both take about 5 days and a few hundred quid. If your under 24 you can ride anything upto a power of 46bhp or get any bike upto 92bhp and restrict it down to 46bhp. This does not expire.

When you turn 24 you can do another test which removes that restriction. If you're over 24 you can do a whats called a direct access test which lets you ride anything straight away. 

I'm a couple of years younger than you and I did my bike test in July, I have a 72bhp 600cc bike, even restricted it will still go straight upto 100mph.

don't get me wrong, a 500cc bike is perfectly fine, but it won't be long before you are itching for something bigger.

also, you have to re-do the tests on a bigger bike to get the increased license, and having the car license doesn't really help much although most of the theory test is the same.

Would we have fewer points with even Adam Morgan instead of Aspas? That's not even a knock on Aspas, I'm sure he would be a great buy for a club with lower aspirations, it's just that at the top end and with a defined budget I don't know how many more points you get out of filling depth versus improving the best positions.

He apologised, and went to great lengths to ensure others didn't follow in his footsteps. He cooperated with McAlpine during the legal proceedings and accepted his punishment.

To me, showing humility, owning up to grievous mistakes made and taking the steps to make sure it doesn't happen again, is certainly a rare sight nowadays, and something I'd like to see from more media personalities, politicians etc.

&gt;

&gt;**Francis Ewan Urquhart** is a fictional [Conservative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK\)) politician created by [Michael Dobbs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dobbs). Known by his initials FU, Urquhart appeared in a trilogy of novels: House of Cards (1989), To Play the King (1992) and The Final Cut (1995). He was portrayed in the BBC TV adaptations by [Ian Richardson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Richardson), who won a [BAFTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA) award for his performance.[](http://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Richardson-dies-2)

&gt;House of Cards follows Urquhart, the government [chief whip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_whip), as he manoeuvres himself through blackmail and murder to the post of [Prime Minister](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom). To Play the King sees Prime Minister Urquhart clash with the newly crowned King of the United Kingdom over disagreements regarding [social justice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice). By the time of The Final Cut, Urquhart has been in power for eleven years, and refuses to relinquish his position until he has beaten [Margaret Thatcher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher)'s record as longest serving post-war Prime Minister.[](http://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-mail-3)

&gt;Thought to be based on [Richard III](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_III_(play\)) and [Macbeth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth_(character\)),[](http://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Richardsons-rule-4) and described as the ""epitome of elegant evil"",[](http://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-daily_mail-5) Urquhart is characterised by his habitual breaking of the [fourth wall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall), his quoting of [Shakespeare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare), and his usage of the [catchphrase](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchphrase), ""You might very well think that; I couldn't possibly comment"", or a variation thereon, as a deniable way of agreeing with people.[](http://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-Richardsons-rule-4)

Based on common sense and basic police work. The student was not from that area, knew no one there and a guy walked up to him, asked the time, walked away, came back and shot him point blank. Didn't rob him, didn't have an argument, didn't even attempt to run but stood laughing over the body.

The police *treated* it as a racist killing due to nothing else fitting. Wasn't a gang killing over drugs or territory, wasn't an argument, wasn't a robbery. They say themselves several time there's no evidence of it being a racist murder, they were simply investigating it as one.

I think the security in primary schools is quite good - as well as keeping intruders out it prevents children from wandering out of the building and off down the road.

&gt;53.4.3 the defined term of Standard Loan in Regulations 53.2.5 to 

&gt;53.2.7 inclusive shall be deemed to include International Loans such that International Loans shall count towards the quotas set out therein.

Article Ten of Fifa states: 
&gt; Under the provisions of these regulations, the loan of a player by one club to another 
is dealt with administratively like a transfer. An international registration transfer 
certificate shall therefore be issued whenever a player leaves a national association 
to join another national association to which the club to which he has been released 
on loan belongs. 
The international registration transfer certificate, on expiry of the period of loan, may 
be returned to the national association of the club, which released the player on 
loan, after a loan period of at least six months. 

More about the duration in England:

&gt; 53.2.2 Subject to the proviso that the duration of a Standard Loan must be the time between two Transfer Windows, Standard Loans can be for half a Season or a full Season. Any recall clause requiring the early termination of a Standard Loan can only be included in a full Season Standard Loan and this can only be activated during the second (January) Transfer Window. Any other early termination of a Standard Loan must be by way of a mutual agreement in writing (including by way of a recall clause within the Standard Loan Agreement) between both Clubs and the Player but can only be completed after the expiry of 28 days and only during a Transfer Window (but subject to Regulation 53.2.3 below).

It strikes me as a kneejerk reaction to not having the transfer window people wanted, because expectation was drummed up so much in the months prior. 

We are doing well, aside from injuries we have a good squad, and it's a pity to see people jumping so quickly to ""sack Ayre"" when none of us have a shred of an idea of what he does, both in terms of signing players and commercial deals he seems to be involved in. 

Just because we signed two very good players last January who improved our squad immensely, doesn't mean we will be able to find that sort of player every January. All this talk of Fernando (or any other player someone has dreamt up, and has subsequently become one of our ""targets"") seems misplaced. If a player is available at the right price, who fits the position and style of play we need, and *wants* to come here over sitting on the bench at Chelsea, I'm sure he would have been signed. 

It seems when Brendan Rogers sticks to his guns on certain aspects of football he gets a pat on the back, but when he doesn't agree with the transfer policy of the minority of 13,296 liverpool fans in a single subreddit, he needs to change his attitude and just sign some players.

&gt;As for tax, not yet, I have only really started this month, how do I go about declaring it? It's really just a hobby at the minute..

I *think* (but definitely check me on this) any gains you have until April must be declared by 31st January 2015. You'll be liable for possibly 18% (or if you earn enough 28%) of the gains you make. There are tax-free amounts you can make though (I think 10k per year). Generally though I'd either get an accountant, or you may simply be able to fill in a self assessment tax return at the end of the year. **Definitely** keep all of your financial records, how much you pay for things and receipts of how much you made. Look at what you may owe, and make sure you keep that (plus a bit of a safety net) aside in a safe place that you don't touch. That way you won't have a problem paying the bill when it comes around.

The limits mean you'll probably (again, check this don't trust me) be fine up until April, but if you keep buying and selling you're likely to make enough you have to pay at least some tax on it.

&gt; I pretty much have everything bar a cooker, which shouldn't be too hard to get :) 

Great, that'll cover most things that are really necessary. Other than that, plan on paying maybe a grand in legal fees, and then possibly 1% of the cost of the house as stamp duty (1% if over 125k, 3% if over 250k). You may have to pay fees for the mortgage, or you can get a fee free mortgage with a higher APR. I'm basing this on figures in England, I'm aware of differences outside of the England in the house buying process, and I have no idea about the Republic of Ireland (I'm not sure where you're planning on moving, I just guessed NI as this is ukpf ;) ).

Overall if you can put away at least £500 a month you'll hit around the figure you want in 3 years. I'd advise you try and put away whatever you make with the antiques (+ anything you can spare) and you should be fairly set.

Now don't get me wrong, I LOVE that scene, I believe the scene with the multiple companions flying the TARDIS to the tune of Song of Freedom to be the absolute height of TV...I just loathe the explanation.

Examples of a single person piloting the TARDIS:  Every single episode, sometimes multiple examples per episode.  River Song flew it solo, Donna flew it solo, Amy flew it solo, it flies ITSELF solo at times, Tasha Lem flew it solo and commented that it's easy.  The Master flew his own solo (and the Doctor's when he stole it), Romana flew it solo, Adric flew it solo, the list goes on.  

Examples of six pilots being needed:  Just the one.

I have always preferred the two-part explanation of why he's always running around the TARDIS like a madman...1) being an older TARDIS, the reliability isn't all there (and as Clara said, the navigation circuit is knackered) and 2) he forgets how half the time.  Add in the fact that he only thinks he's in charge of where the box goes (Sexy overrules his decisions quite often) and that's why he's running around like a madman.

As a side note, I also hate the ""you leave the parking brakes on"" bit, as the Doctor himself has flown the TARDIS plenty of times without that noise, other TARDISes (TARDII?) flown by others have made the noise, and the Doctor's TARDIS has made the noise when others (see above) have flown it.",0,1390934620,null,0,false,0,cf13g56,t3_1wd6yh,t1_cf13g56,t1_cf0zvl3,null,1432146284,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

&gt;Loftus-Cheek will turn 18 later on this month, and made his debut with the U18 side while Carlo Ancelotti was still in charge. He spent most of the 2011/12 and 2012/13 season with the U18 side, but made fairly regular appearances for the U21 side as well. This season has seen him playing primarily with the U21 group, though he's also been participating in the European campaign.

&gt;Like Christensen, Ruben was given a chance to play with the first team in the USA. Also like Christensen, most fans came away thinking we had something special for the future with him.

&gt;Chelsea have an impressive trio of midfielders at the U21 level this year, but Ruben has the best combination of size and athleticism of the three. He's probably the best defensively of  the bunch, while still offering a decent amount of offensive upside. Combined with being the youngest of that trio, this has led to Loftus-Cheek being the highest ranked player on this year's list that isn't currently out on loan or training with the first team.

&gt;What Chelsea decide to do with the player now will certainly be interesting. He's definitely ready for a loan spell somewhere, and he's already been at Chelsea for the three years required for him to eventually qualify as homegrown. He's on a very high wage for a young player though, so the club will definitely need to subsidize his wages in order to find a taker.

However, OP is not the first to experience this.  I went from Pertwee to Baker the First just fine.  Tom was my Doctor, absolutely.  I took the change to Davidson without much fuss, but it took a bit of time for me to accept him as the Doctor.  Baker the Second killed it for me (and many others I understand) and I stopped watching for while.  I eventually caught up with him and McCoy in reruns (well, this was American in the 80's/90's, they were ALL reruns) but never warmed to the Sixth Doctor, and I doubt I ever will.  Colin Baker I love, he's a wonderful man, and he doesn't deserve even a fraction of the crap he gets.  If I look at it objectively, he PLAYED the Sixth very well, nobody can fault his acting...it's just that the character is so unlikeable.

I don't think people are been stitched up.  I don't think the met police are being racist towards the Vietnamese.  I think it is a case of it is very hard to legally enter the UK for a long period of time for a Vietnamese person (not to mention the bond they have to pay to leave home).  This means that a larger than otherwise proportion of the Vietnamese people will be those who are here for illegal activity, as the 'honest' kind simply won't have the option of coming here.

It doesn't matter how many Vietnamese I know who are here legally that are top notch people.  They are statistically, significantly more likely to be imprisoned for criminal activities than a British national.

So I think your assertion that the masses are ready to rise up, Kiev-style, if only they were better informed is inherently incorrect. The problem we have is not transparency its engagement. People **don't care**. It's hard saying that as an active and passionate member but it's true. Most people don't know what the Union does or what it can do. Instead of pushing for reforms which requires greater engagement, makes it a necessity, we should instead work to make the average student engaged in the Union. Get them interested, get them passionate. Once we can start getting some ASV's quorate (that's 300 people voting folks) then maybe we can start talking about referenda which need 600 people to be quorate.

Until then, anything like this just slows down the whole process. Infact, if this motion had passed anything sent to referenda which was then not quorate would force Kent Union to take no stance on that issue at all.

First of all, ""more exciting"". What does that mean? That life in monocultural Britain is boring, and Brits need to experience other cultures within their own country as a form of ""cultural enrichment""? This idea is just as fallacious as the ""exotic food"" argument I keep hearing - it's really naive and fallacious. Is exotic food or ""learning about other cultures"" really a good reason to change the cultural and ethnic makeup of a nation? I don't think so.

How about ""healthier""? That could be interpreted in multiple ways. Economically, there's different factors to consider. It is true that the average immigrant to the UK is more educated. However, this ignores the different types of immigrants that arrive. Migrants that apply for residency and compete with others for spots based on criteria such as education and economic viability could be said to make Britain ""healthier"" economically. However, the fact that these migrants compete with locals for jobs is discouraging for British people and that can cause problems. Furthermore, people who come to the UK via the EU are completely unselected and unregulated, and so arrivals can range from productive individuals to mooching scumbags, and we can all agree that the latter category is a net drain on the economy. Furthermore, the problem of immigrants taking money out of the British economy by sending it to relatives or friends in their homeland is also a concern.

Or, maybe ""healthier"" refers to the social aspects of immigration. the UK's fertility rate is 1.98 births per woman, which is below replacement (2.1 bpw). Therefore, it could be argued that immigration keeps British population growth up and therefore the country avoids things such as not enough workers to pay for retirees and other problems of a top-heavy population. However, I feel that this misses the social problems of integration and culture, because such a trend means that the native British population will be eventually replaced as the majority within their homeland. Call me nationalistic, but I don't think that such population replacement is a good trend, especially considering potential conflict between poorly-integrated groups that are growing fast.

All in all, while selecting migrants for their ""net worth"" if you will can be advantageous to the nation, most other arguments for immigration are pretty weak in my opinion.",1,1390936311,null,0,false,0,cf14awo,t3_1wdzvj,t1_cf14awo,t3_1wdzvj,null,1432146664,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

And the stable black hole has been moved from the theoretical centre of the dimensional interior to the rear, channeling the power as it was always meant to be done.

(INT. T50 TARDIS)

JEREMY (V.O.): Inside the gnomes of Gallifrey have been busy as well.  The dash features leather and brushed steel, the lighting is discreet as an MP's sex scandal.  There's a new sound system for your iHarmony.  And actual chairs, not the just occasional papasan.  

(INT. T50 Console Room)

JEREMY: Which is all very nice.  But how does it drive?  Well, look at this console?  In the T40, you'd flip a switch, pump the temporal stabilizers, reintegrate the dampening fields, and you were in Rome or Terra Alpha.  But now, first I have to choose which type of TARDIS ride I want.  

(there is a MONITOR with a DIAL which JEREMY flips through)

JEREMY: There's Regular.   Utility.  Economy.  Economy?  Right, because when taking on a Cyberbatallion I really want to make sure I'm not using too much Zeiton-7.  

(EXT. Ursa Minor.  The TYPE 50 executes a series of maneuvers)

JEREMY (V.O.): So I put her in Sport mode, took her out.  In real space, the difference is notable.  The cornering is precise, the power is controlled, gravity wells just nip at the edges.  But where she really makes a notice is in the Vortex.

(EXT. TYPE 50 spinning through Vortex incredibly quickly.  Light phases from red to blue and back again.  Lightning streams around the TYPE 50)

(INT. CONSOLE ROOM.  JEREMY'S face is lit up)

JEREMY: I mean, it's just amazing.  I just went through two pocket universes, a full thermodynamic heat death of the universe, and a bit of custard, and she's hardly ticking over at all.  The ride is smooth, the engines barely humming.  It's a triumph.

(EXT. TYPE 50 lands in a gravel quarry)

JEREMY (V.O.): And that's really the downfall of the new Type 50.  Yes, it's better in every way, except the most important.  It's so safe, it's no fun.  There's no vwoomp-vwoomp noise.  No sense of adventure.  No flailing about with a chance of hitting your head and starting your regeneration cycle.  It's just... a mode of conveyance.  

(INT. STUDIO. T40 exterior in police box shape)

I'm not sure things are so flexible or fungible in the housing market - if you buy a house, you're lumped with it for years. Sure, that's a great reason one should try to make the right decision in the first place, but it makes us more susceptible to our mistakes or pushy salesmen. I think this might well make the market less responsive, and that the huge number of factors involved in comparison shopping may well lead to some kind of *tragedy of the commons* situation, in which buyers are genuinely not able to influence the market.

I understand and sympathise with your reservations about Old Man Whitehall telling us what we can and can't trade - I'm a great believer in competitive markets myself, when they work.

If housing was not an essential necessity, and we did not have a shortage of it, then maybe people would be in a better position to say to house builders, ""you know what, I don't like this particular minor detail, I'm going to look at all the other alternatives in this street instead"".

The link, YOU provided where in 58 killing the police considered the motive racial when the victim was white in HALF the cases. I mean, I've only pointed that out to you about three or four times now. How long are you going to claim this form of myopia?

&gt;If I follow correct your stat was for known cases, so police are not assuming, they have evidence at that point.

No, it was simply the police saying the ""considered"" race to have played a key part. If there was evidence and it was a done trial then why the hell would we be looking at the police and not the CPS and convictions?

Everything else is your selective vision of, agains sadly, what you want to see...which is the heartbreaking part. Why do you want to be so miserable? Why the fear?

Why have you left out court cases like [this one](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9022314/Gang-members-walk-free-from-court-after-leaving-man-for-dead.html) where no racial element is involved but once again our courts let down the victim?

It's almost as if such stories interwoven with yours would nullify the notion that there was indeed a racial element to a systemic legal issue.

Why does your narrative run contrary to [official reports about court leniency](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/courts-are-biased-against-blacks-with-white-offenders-less-likely-to-be-jailed-for-similar-crimes-says-official-report-8959804.html)? What is it you know that the official records don't show? Why don't you link the cases you cite above to the many other incidents of leniency in British courts? Maybe because without those you can paint this picture of an inexplicable bias where white policemen, prosecutors and judges are simply itching to fuck over other white people for some sort of perverse gain you've yet to reveal.

&gt;It strikes me as a kneejerk reaction to not having the transfer window people wanted

I think it's more a reaction to not having a transfer window *at all.*

&gt;We are doing well, aside from injuries we have a good squad

OK, but do we play in a magical world where injured players can still play? No? Then saying ""aside from injuries"" is totally meaningless. We need to reinforce our squad to cope with the DEVASTATION that has been wreaked on our defense by injuries. It sucks and it's terribly unlucky, but we're not going to get CL with a 6th place finish because people feel sorry for us for having so many injuries. 

And to be fair, BR's own philosophy is that there should be competition for every spot. People were saying we needed some cover for Lucas *this summer*, and yet we still have none and now we're going to have to play without him for a month. I'm assuming you watched the Villa match, so the prospect of playing without Lucas for a month with no cover should be as horrifying to you as it is to the rest of us, especially given the very important games during this time. 

&gt; If a player is available at the right price, who fits the position and style of play we need, and wants to come here over sitting on the bench at Chelsea, I'm sure he would have been signed.

Salah was available and would have come here if we'd done the deal earlier before Chelsea decided to sell Mata and get involved. His agent has said we spent *two and a half months* haggling over the price. I agree we don't need to waste money....but at the end of the day, sometimes the extra million or two is worth the time you save in that you can actually sign the target. Obviously you can't be sure, but from what I've read I've gotten the impression that if we'd budged a little more on the price, we could've signed Salah on deadline day. 

That said, I think part of the frustration here is that most people don't feel like Salah necessarily should have been the primary target anyway. It's been obvious we needed some cover at CDM even before Lucas was hurt, and I think a lot of us (myself included) think we should have been focused on that rather than wasting the first few weeks of the window on a player we probably don't need AND that we once again failed to get because we moved too slowly. 

&gt;It seems when Brendan Rogers sticks to his guns on certain aspects of football he gets a pat on the back, but when he doesn't agree with the transfer policy of the minority of 13,296 liverpool fans in a single subreddit, he needs to change his attitude and just sign some players.

I don't think many people are complaining about BR w/r/t the transfer policy. My impression is that most people are frustrated with the fact that we seem to take *forever* negotiating with the players we want, and it always gets leaked to the press, so other clubs are given time to come in and outbid us. I think that has more to do with Ayre and probably FSG than it does with BR. 

Ultimately, here's why lots of people are frustrated: This isn't just *any* window. With United in flux, there's a CL spot more within reach than one has been in quite a while -- and with United signing Mata and making noise over more big players in the summer, it's likely that this kind of opportunity is not going to come again.

United has more money than us. Chelsea has more money than us. City has more money than us. Arsenal has more money than us. In the average year, we're not going to be able to field a squad as good as they are.

So, this year presents a unique opportunity....if we can just hold our spot and get into the CL, it opens up a whole new world, more money, easier to get players, etc. But we've been unlucky with injuries, and instead of biting the bullet and spending a little extra to help ensure we can attain CL and reach our goal, the club seems to be stubbornly sticking to this idea that if the perfect player isn't available at the perfect price, we'll just buy nothing. In another season that might be fine, but given the unique opportunity we have this year, it seems like a huge risk to potentially throw away the whole season (and probably Suarez) just to keep from having to overpay 3 or 4 million for a player we need now. 

Now, I desperately hope I'm wrong about this. But here's why I'm upset: I genuinely think that missing Lucas for this long, without someone else decent to play there, *we will not get fourth.* ",0,1390938273,null,0,1390947221,0,cf15buw,t3_1wdvor,t1_cf15buw,t1_cf1322c,null,1432147045,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

&gt; The link, YOU provided where in 58 killing the police considered the motive racial when the victim was white in HALF the cases. I mean, I've only pointed that out to you about three or four times now. How long are you going to claim this form of myopia?


My point is really quite specific;that racism is considered the default, even when there is no evidence pointing to it. 

In the instance of the Indian lad, there was nothing, nothing at all, even when the race of the attacker is unknown police will consider whether it is a racist attack, but if a white person is attacked and the attacker is unknown then racism will not be assumed to be the cause.

&gt;Why have you left out court cases like this one[1] where no racial element is involved but once again our courts let down the victim? Or this one[2] ? Or this one[3] ? Or maybe this one[4] ? And this one too[5] .

Not sure what you are trying to illustrate. My point: crime against non whites by whites is super serious business, white on white is not.

Can you show me where white folk have crimed non whites with lesser censure than would be expected vice versa?

&gt;Why does your narrative run contrary to official reports about court leniency[6] ?

I am specifically talking about inter racial crime.

Who am I fearful of? I have little interaction with type of reprobate so keen preying on others, one of the few benefits of gainful employment.

When a previous contract at a Data Centre came to an end I applied for the the first available job that I saw down the Job Centre in order to have an income, which just happened to be office cleaning.

Sorry but I've been there and done it and I would do it again if the need was there.

&gt; I'm sorry if you think that I shouldn't feel like I'm entitled to work in the sector I fucking paid to be trained in.

I'm not saying that at all, I'm saying that you shouldn't act like bar work or sweeping floors isn't good enough for you whilst you look for the sort of job that you actually want to do.

I think the problem there is you, rather than how any external organisation or person is making you feel.

I can't say I've ever had all that much luck in finding professional work via the Job Centre, but I've never actively turned down work - far better to be in work and earning money (and checking the job sites every evening or on your break) than to be rotting away on the dole waiting for that One True Job that will kick start everything and make like good again.

&gt; Another example of savings has come out today
&gt; 
&gt; https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/osor/news/finnish-schools-using-open-source-reap-savings
&gt; 
&gt; 10 Million euro savings in Finnish schools by moving to opensource - I wonder how much we could save in the UK. 10 Million savings would be nice.

That's not *just* from a switch to free software; that's from their cost-saving excercise, which included a migration to Puavo which centralises admin and removes unneeded redundancy. This would make any installation cheaper; centralising the administration of Windows machines would also remove the need for much infrastructure and mean you could run with far fewer support staff.

Lets say you dumbly went and bought [Windows](http://www.scan.co.uk/products/microsoft-windows-81-64-bit-english-international-1pk-dsp-oei-dvd) and [Office](http://www.scan.co.uk/products/microsoft-office-home-and-student-2013-32-64-bit-english-eurozone-medialess) for each of those 9000 laptops from scan. That's (70+95)*2000 = £1485000 ~ €1802197; almost 20% of the cost savings, assuming an artificially high cost of licensing. What licenses were previously bought with that other 8 million euros?

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; My point is really quite specific;that racism is considered the default, even when there is no evidence pointing to it.

And in the one case you cited where this supposedly happened there was ZERO evidence for any other motive either. They checked. It's not like they didn't bother to investigate. DAYS later they say they will investigate a racial motive too, but STRESS there was no evidence of said motivation. You have no leg to stand on with this claim. It's spurious.

&gt;Not sure what you are trying to illustrate. My point: crime against non whites by whites is super serious business, white on white is not.

You cite a bunch of carefully selected cases (without links) where you didn't like the outcome, and thus blame race, while ignoring all the other cases where the outcome was less than ideal *not* involving race. My point being that your issues are with the courts, not race.

&gt;Can you show me where white folk have crimed non whites with lesser censure than would be expected vice versa?

Can you show me a press report for the near 50k hate crimes that are reported annually? Because chances are they don't all make the papers. That would be lunacy.

Traditional British - Ned Ludd, Roundhouse, Fothergills, Hand &amp; Heart

Italian - Pelican Club

French - Le Mistral 

Burger's - Annie's Burger Shack

Indian - Kayal

Oriental - Banzai


All of these places are reasonably priced, imo.

For coffee or daytime snacks I'd say Edin's (and Natural Kitchen), Delilah's, Lee Rosy's, The Coffee House in Hurt's Yard, Malt Cross. Especially the latter is a nice building worth having a look at. 

Delilah's is a deli/cafe full of lovely stuff to buy - nice if they want to bring something back home!

If your parents want to go for a drink, I'd recommend Boilermaker, Brass Monkey, Brewdog, Malt Cross, Kean's Head, Hand &amp; Heart, Tilt and Pelican Club for a more 'grown-up' environment without too many students or chavs. They are a bit pricier than your average pub, but each of them is memorable.

true,strolls,null,null,"&gt; What I understand is that the LibDems were the Kingmakers; they had an extreme amount of leverage over a Tory party that hadn't been in power for 13 years - and instead they sold their souls for a pittance and were totally outmanoeuvred on their ""wins"" (AV Referendum &amp; Lords Reform).

I think that maybe Nick could have bargained for more, and I agree with you that he looks totally outmanoeuvred, but there was also risk to the LibDems sticking their necks out and hanging parliament. 

The LibDems could have made themselves look like the first party in decades (or second time in a century or something?) to hang parliament and cause such uncertainty.

It's easy for me to look at that now and say ""I don't care if they hang parliament, they should have been more stubborn and taught everyone a lesson"", but they could easily have left us without a prime minister for months. The FPTP voting system means that they need to appeal to everyone, and a long period of uncertainty is not wossisname. 

You say ""a Tory party that hadn't been in power for 13 years"", but it's not like Labour were much popular, neither - they just got voted out. The LibDems couldn't afford to align with them. So hung parliament uncertainty risked people thinking ""well, I voted for them, and they only cocked things up worse"".

They look like a bunch of plonkers now, because Nick bet his shirt on the AV Referendum - but that was fulfilling the promise on which the LibDem faithful had been voting for them for years. Honestly, I was shocked, too, that the electorate could vote for a *provably* less democratic voting system - had I imagined this possible, I'd have been knocking on doors myself.",0,1390942117,null,0,false,0,cf17aax,t3_1wd5wo,t1_cf17aax,t1_cf0x3sw,null,1432148234,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,BrokenClockwerk,lfc50,,"You are contradicting yourself so hard right now. You say that paying a lot for Torres made sense, and we need to spend big to win, but that spending big on Downing, Carroll, etc was bad because they flopped. You can't know if a player will flop or not, and although I agree better scouting is necessary, scouting for ""deals"" is not a bad way to run the club.

Here is a list of ""Budget"" (At least 2m, but also 12m or less) players we bought under Rafa.

* Xabi (Success)
* Reina (Success)
* Momo (Success)
* Agger (Success)
* Kuyt (Success)
* Arbeloa (Success)
* Lucas (Success)
* Skrtel (Success)
* Luis Garcia (Success)
* Bellamy (Success)
* Josemi (Flop)
* Crouch (Neutral)
* Morientes (Neutral)
* Yossi (Neutral)
* Babel (Flop)
* Dossena (Flop)
* Cagalieri (Flop)
* Riera (Neutral)
* Kyrgiakos (Flop)

53% successes, 74% if you count Yossi, Morientes, Riera and Crouch as successful.

Here is a list of ""Luxury"" (17m or more) players that we bought under Rafa.

* Keane (Flop)
* Aquilani (Flop)
* Torres (Success)
* Johnson (Success)

50% chance of success, albeit from a much smaller sample size.

There is quality in the market, and there is quality that's cheap. No, going all in for free transfers (Voronin, Degen, Jovanovic) is not a recipe for success, but dropping fat stacks on players doesn't guarantee success, and the failure of a player like Aquilani has far greater effects on the club's finances than the failure of a player like Kyrgiakos.",0,1390943393,null,0,false,0,cf17xv8,t3_1wdf4g,t1_cf17xv8,t1_cf11k6y,null,1432148596,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

He's crucial in the U21's, and he makes the players look like boys when he's on the ball.

&gt;**The Raft of the Medusa** ([French](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): **Le Radeau de la Méduse**) is an [oil painting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_painting) of 1818–1819 by the French [Romantic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_movement) painter and [lithographer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithography) [Théodore Géricault](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9odore_G%C3%A9ricault) (1791–1824). Completed when the artist was 27, the work has become an icon of French Romanticism. At 491 cm × 716 cm (193.3 in × 282.3 in),[](http://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-1) it is an over-life-size painting that depicts a moment from the aftermath of the wreck of the French naval [frigate Méduse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_frigate_M%C3%A9duse_(1810\)), which ran aground off the coast of today's [Mauritania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania) on July 5, 1816. At least 147 people were set adrift on a hurriedly constructed raft; all but 15 died in the 13 days before their rescue, and those who survived endured starvation and dehydration and practiced cannibalism. The event became an international scandal, in part because its cause was widely attributed to the incompetence of the French captain perceived to be acting under the authority of the recently [restored French monarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Restoration). In reality, King [Louis XVIII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XVIII_of_France) had no say in the captain's appointment, since monarchs were not directly involved in appointments made to vessels like a naval frigate. The appointment of the vicomte de Chaumareys as captain of the Méduse would have been a routine naval appointment, made within the Ministry of the Navy.[](http://en.wikipedia.org#cite_note-2)

Game is going way way too fast for Barry to get a grip on it, same with Alcalraz.

Nationwide Flex Account it's a good account generally however if you get the FlexAccount Plus for £10/m you get a load of extras that are useful while travelling. 

1) No ATMs fees / exchange rate fees

2) Travel insurance (31 days but I extended to 94 days no probs)

3) Worldwide phone insurance

4) European car breakdown cover

Also you get 4-5% interest rate (which is much better than the usual 0-1%) pay monthly which pays back a chunk of your £10.

* Mignolet: Rock solid when called upon but wasn't tested too much by Everton.

* Flanagan: The kid isn't fazed by anything. Had Pienaar and Baines in his pocket.

* Skrtel: People can say what they will about him and his risky style of defending, but I think he's an absolute rock at the back.

* Toure: Led from the back with authority but does lack the pace to match players like Mirallas.

* Cissokho: Again pretty solid, still doesn't offer much when he attacks though.

* Gerrard: A real captain's performance. Delighted he got the goal and he performed that new role quite well.

* Henderson: One of his quieter games but didn't really set a foot wrong.

* Coutinho: This is the Coutinho I know and love. Always a threat on the ball and got a nice assist for Sturridge's goal.

* Sterling: Blistering pace. Nobody could handle him and it's a shame he didn't get a goal tonight.

* Sturridge: Wasn't happy one or two times when he was selfish and didn't pick out a teammate, but he clinically put away his goals and was man of the match for me. Also happy to see him helping out defensively.

* Suarez: The man just doesn't stop running. Got himself a fantastic goal but was also willing to help out the team when needed.",0,1390946112,null,0,false,0,cf19bj2,t3_1wemkh,t1_cf19bj2,t3_1wemkh,null,1432149272,35,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,35

I was sure this subreddit was going to be deleted if we drew or lost this game. Thank fuck we won!

Mignolet, excellent performance, a few vital saves and no blunders

Flanno, solid performance, didn't give Mirallas and Baines much love down his wing thanks to Sterling and Sturridge tracking back. 

Skrtel and Kolo, WHAT A PERFORMANCE. You could have set up a barricade in front of the goals and it wouldn't have blocked has many shots as these two. Cleared everything and won most aerial duals, kept us in it!

Cissokho, played well defensively I suppose, solid performance for a derby game.

Gerrard, THANK YOU BASED GERRARD. What a commanding performance, played like a general. Him and Hendo were superb.

Henderson, pressing constantly from start to end. Had a huge impact in the game I think, another performance that will fly over the heads of the critics

Coutinho and Sterling probably there best dual performance all year. They started every break from defense to attack with their speed and dribbling, great passing and both got absolutely stuck in physically.

Suarez, another fantastic performance by Suarez, wasn't on the ball as much has he used to but you can see when he's off the ball, he's directing the play and creating space for other players. In my opinion, that was one of his best goals for Liverpool, a solo break from midfielder and a tidy finish to end it. 

Sturridge was class, got alot of shit for being greedy but I could understand if you're on the brink of a hat-trick in the derby. Great goals for Daniel. 

Absolutely over the moon with that performance, great defensively and our counter attacking caused serious problems. If you want a lesson in counter attacking, a highlight reel of that game should suffice. 

Rodgers got it absolutely spot on today, and we trumped Everton because of it. 10/10 managerial performance. YNWA",0,1390946450,null,0,false,0,cf19hpi,t3_1wemkh,t1_cf19hpi,t3_1wemkh,null,1435514012,34,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,34

Villa was 4-2-2-2, and Henderson-Gerrard is a midfield duo begging to be overrun.

true,Rebelius,cnty-uk,Edinburgh,"When it was brought in in 2006, Lifetime Allowance was £1.5m, then it gradually increased to £1.8m last year, when they announced that it was going to drop to £1.5m for this year and £1.25m for next.

I imagine once it's down to what they think is a reasonable level, future governments will increase it as inflation decreases purchasing power. 

I think HMRC use around 5% as an indicator for current annuity rates when they do their guidance for defined benefit schemes (if you have a final salary pension of £25k pa they treat it like a pot of £500k).

The tax is taken before you take the payment - 55% on anything over the allowance which is taken as a lump sum and 25% on anything taken as an annuity.

So if the limit were £1m and your pot was £1.2m, you could take the whole lot as an annuity and you'd pay £50k (25% of 200k) tax and then receive ~£60k pa. The pension administrator would actually pay the tax charge, so you wouldn't see that 50k at all.

Not sure about with taking tax free cash, because I don't know if you get 25% before the charge or how it's applied. Most people with pots over the lifetime allowance actually have some kind of protection and will certainly have a decent financial advisor working for them to make sure they get the most possible.

I gather due to being a small business I am limited as you thought. Due to this I guess I will just compare which is best when we implement it, as you say with as little overheads as possible.

This does upset me somewhat as pensions are known not to be the safest things around. I guess I will just warn everyone but still they will be getting the matched savings from me so I guess that reduces some of their risk.

Unfortunately, yes. If you pay 20% corporation tax then you will still lose the other 80%. 

I think pensions are a bit safer than you might think. The biggest shock in terms of pension provider failures was Equitable Life but a lot of the providers are much more secure now.  Personally I don't like them, and I certainly don't like auto enrolment. This is because pensions are too restrictive and too prone to meddling by different governments, especially now that so much more money will be tied up in them. My worry is that a lot more people will reach retirement with small pots and will be offered terrible annuity rates, but they won't bother shopping around because ""it's only a small pot"". My other worry is that companies and individuals are going to have less disposable income, which will have some impact (especially on lower earners and small companies). The Pensions Regulator was quick to brag about low opt out rates last year, but this was only for the biggest companies in the UK. As soon as smaller companies reach their staging dates we will see much higher opt out rates, because some employees will face the choice of having a pension but losing a colleague. Of course that's against the rules, so above everything else just make sure you don't piss the regulator off! Anything you choose should be a fairly good scheme. You should update this when you have looked closer at different providers because there will be more and more people wanting to read about different people's experiences.",0,1390951114,null,0,false,0,cf1bra0,t3_1wdr8u,t1_cf1bra0,t1_cf1axnu,null,1432150491,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

I chose to drive as I think it is the most practical way of travelling. Public transport can't please everyone as you can't connect from every point to every other point. Cycling is far too dangerous.

Cyclists want to ban HGVs. But the deliveries made by HGVs are essential for the world's economy unlike many trips by cycle which are just for fun or in the name of exercise. If you want to exercise what about using one of the perfectly good swimming pools. Swimming is enjoyed by everyone unlike cycling which is only liked by a few lunatics

Cyclists who cannot accept how dangerous it is are the biggest blamers of Decent motorists. They put themselves in danger by cutting in and out of traffic and going through red lights yet they always say it is the decent law abiding motorist who is at fault.

We motorists have undergone extensive training and risk losing our license if we break the law. We also pay VED which doesn't have to be spent on roads but I'm sure roads are effectively paid for by VED. Yet cyclists who are minority and probably don't pay for roads demand that they get their on way how roads are designed.

It is time for the Prime Minister to make a very difficult decision and ban cycling for the health and safety of everyone. At the very least VED should be able extended to bicycles (and low emission cars) and for cumplusory training for cyclists to be introduced. If you don't pay and arn't trained then tough.

Not worth the time to the supermarket to keep staff on that late. Plus, do you want to be the guy who spends his night shift guarding something which is worth nothing to the company you work for? Job satisfaction is pretty low there.

The best argument which keeps getting dismissed. However, Food Banks usually only take non-perishables, which generally aren't the kind of thing being thrown away. Plus, food is thrown away for much more reasons than just being the end-of-day produce: maybe it's been on the floor, maybe it's rotten, but they certainly don't sort food before chucking it. New policies would have to be made to separate that which is okay to give out and which should be binned, which means more employment, more regulation, and when the companies aren't getting anything back other than goodwill it just isn't viable for them without some sort of benefit in the other direction.

The number of people surviving beyond 100 could explode in the next few decades. It would also set an awkward precedent if the state were to say there is effectively a secondary pension/retirement that occurs beyond 100. In particular it would complicate things like care homes - i.e. most &gt;100 year olds live in warden controlled flats, residential homes or care homes that are either self funded or state funded, in some cases combinations of the two. The type of location they live in is in part decided by the funds they have available - i.e. those with their own cash can afford ""nicer"" retirement locations. So if you re-pensioned someone on this sort of ultimatum pension, you'd be providing them with funds they may never have had access to even in their retirement.

Imagine your office network - that's the ""Private Network"" and nothing can connect in directly from the outside.

Now... the ""Virtual"" part.  Essentially, it's an encrypted link *into* your office network that allows you to act as if you were already physically inside, hence ""virtual"" because it's fake but behaves in the same way.

You establish your VPN connection and connect to an external VPN endpoint on your company's network.  The VPN server will give that network adapter a valid IP address for your corporate network, usually from a pool dedicated solely for VPN connections.  The VPN server has its own routing table which allows it to direct your traffic to the right part of the internal network (and back again).

Exact same goes for these VPN services.  All that happens is you connect to their network and the traffic appears to be from them rather than you.

What I really liked was that with three men in the middle we were able neutralize Barkley for the most part, and we could attack with the ball through the middle of the park, whereas normally we would very quickly push the ball to the wings on the attack.  By keeping the ball centrally on counters it provided more motivation for all top 3 attacking players to make runs stretching the defense, giving Coutinho great options.

The best way around this, is to use an anonymous VPN service, coupled with an intermediary ""logless"" machine operated by a trusted party.

And therein lies the problem.  You don't know who runs these services, how they're configured, what data is being kept.

Although to be entirely fair, most of the services I've seen accept PayPal and I'm sure many now take Bitcoin etc.

Even the beloved IPREDATOR keeps logs (they keep DHCP lease logs and timestamps, but no traffic or personally identifiable information) and they'll happily hand them over if the Swedish authorities can prove a criminal case against an individual with a realistic prospect of 2+ years in prison.

That nice little VPN service in Panama?  If you're lucky, it's the Panamian intelligence services trying to catch political dissidents, alternatively, it's an NSA honeypot preying on the gullible.  That Russian VPN?  Criminals who are logging absolutely everything.

* They could make an episode that happens at the same time as ""The Fires of Pompeii"" Where 12 tried to explore where his regeneration comes from as he's already met him. They could use the chameleon arch to make Capaldi's doctor Caecilius - that would explain why they look the same.
* However I think it's more likely that they will explain where the doctor's regenerations come from rather than the 12th doctor using the chameleon arch to go undercover. Moffatt also said that they are going to explain why Capaldi was in Torchwood as well. 

* Steven Moffat quote - ""I remember Russell [T Davies] told me that he had a big old plan as to why there were two Peter Capaldi’s in the Who universe: one in Pompeii and one in Torchwood. When I cast Peter and Russell got in touch to say how pleased he was, I said, ‘Okay, what was your theory and does it still work?” and he said, ‘Yes it does. Here it is…’""
* Steven Moffat quote - ""The face is not set from birth. It’s not like he was always going to be one day Peter Capaldi. We know that’s the case because in The War Games he has a choice of faces. So we know it’s not set, so where does he get those faces from? They can’t just be randomly generated because they’ve got lines. They’ve aged. When he turns into Peter he’ll actually have lines on his face.
So where did that face come from?""

Although Rule number 1 - Moffat Lies!

I also think Moffatt will resolve Tom Baker's Curator/Doctor with this as well.

Series/Season 7 is a gigantic mess, regardless of how you feel about the end product.* Series 7 feels like 2 half seasons and a lot of things happened because the plot said so and not naturally when they are supposed to. 

Karen and Arthur leaving the show was not the problem. Actors leave shows all the time. The problem is more Amy and Rory. Say what you want, they are uncooperative characters. They were addicted to traveling with the Doctor. No matter what Moffat could have done to get them to leave, they would have found a way to get back to the Doctor. The Doctor would have found them at some point as well. So, atleast to my analysis, Moffat had to force them apart by making up a bullshit rule about the Tardis being incapable of landing in New York to rescue them and so on. 

Clara was a victim of circumstance. Moffat did not have time to make her a character until Time of the Doctor. Again, not the character's fault she was treated as a plot device and not a fleshed out character until then. 

But, I can't blame the writer completely on this. Moffat had to write Amy and Rory off the show at the same time he's introducing the replacement companion. He also had to deal with getting the pieces of the Day of the Doctor in place. Also, the surprise announcement of Matt Smith leaving the show probably put the kibosh on a lot of his season 8 plans and he had to recover at the last minute.

You would think there would be a much greater public interest in the quality of new housing that is built, considering that it's where our children are going to end up living.

Cramped, ugly, expensive and poorly constructed houses are going to retard this country and it's economy. Everybody knows what a difference it makes living in nice surroundings. If you live in a nice house, you want to keep it nice, you spend money on it. You fill it with nice things. How is our economy going to thrive if the population can only consume foodstuffs because their distended stomachs are the greatest storage asset they possess! How will we encourage healthy eating and home-cooking when so many kitchens are cramped and ill-equipped? How will our children grow up to be healthy, happy adults if they have no garden to play in, or space for toys and books and friends and the prospect of an adulthood doomed to sitting in more cramped, ugly little boxes, hunched over their smart-phones feeling depressed. We have a strong, growing Western economy. We are quite capable of building architecturally attractive, spacious buildings with character and flair, habitats fit for the next generation, houses that we can be proud of as a nation. I have to avert my eyes and resist the urge to rage everytime I drive past half a dozen new build estates in the middle of fields near where I live. The sight of them makes me despair for the future.

Back to back yellows resulting in a red for two reckless challenges is a one game suspension. Usually a caution is given for a ""careless"" challenge - late but not aggressive, or caught ball-watching or leaving into a player who's in the air.


A straight red for interfering with a player in on goal (shirt pull, trip, handball in the box) while the last man between the attacker and keeper is a one game ban.

1. In some stores there would be a main character that would be asian for example but they would cast a white guy to play the asian/spanish/etc role. This was just the way of the times unfortunately.

2. The older the episodes, the slower they will progress. We are used to like 5 different stories going on at a time and they being answered within a 2 or 3 episodes but the older you go the slower they will move (not to say their bad) but you might not be used to it.

Agreed, Elmander held the ball up well and won us a couple of late corners and it was Redmond's low cross that led to Hooper's shot at the crossbar and also Redmond's dinked ball to the far post that led to Snodgrass's headed attempt.

I think Redmond deserves a starting place but honestly with our wingers at the moment it's hard to tell who to take out...

I'm a huge fan of Pilks, he's really creative and intelligen and has been our 3rd highest scorer for the past 2 seasons in a row and consistently performs well and gets goals in the big games (Chelsea this season, Man Utd last season, etc) 

You also can't dispute Snodgrass' statistics. The amount of crosses he puts in to the box, the amount of *clear cut* goalscoring opportunities that he creates per game exceeds that of any of our other wingers. He's also killer from set-pieces so deciding who makes way for Redmond is tough.

He's consistently been one of our worst performers, his passing accuracy (76%) is one of the worst in the entire league right now and he's given away far too many free-kicks on the edge of the box that have led to goals this season.

This gives Tettey the chance he needs to get back in to the team for the next 3 games, which gives Howson time to recover to take back his CM position from Johnson who most likely won't get any more game time this season (hurray!).

Here's a quick comparison of Tettey and Johnson, who're both considered to be defensive midfielders.

&gt;Same as [Dr. Who](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Dr.+Who)



&gt;The Doctor is a [Time Lord](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Time+Lord), an extraterrestrial from the planet [Gallifrey](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Gallifrey), who travels in a time machine called the [TARDIS](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TARDIS).



&gt;Sometimes he is accompanied by [companions](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=companions) who have chosen to travel with him for a variety of reasons.



&gt;Although he physically resembles a human, as a [Time Lord](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Time+Lord) his physiology is different. Once a [Time Lord](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Time+Lord) suffers a mortal injury, illness, or old age, he uses the ability to [regenerate](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=regenerate).
