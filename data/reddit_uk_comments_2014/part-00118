Had we lost in the Champions League game with us also losing on Sunday, Mourinho would have had 3 straight losses, and to any other club that's fine, but not with us. Don't be fooled into thinking Roman has changed his ways, he hasn't and he never will.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  Where I am looking monthly mortgage payments generally seem to be at least £100 less per month than rental rates.

Agreed. So with that in mind lets examine this argument looking at expenses you have as a home owner which are either the landlords responsibility or not required as a renter. We'll ignore the four figure fees you pay when buying a property...

Annual gas safety check: £75 per appliance so if you've a gas boiler and a gas cooker there's £150. 

Buildings insurance: £150

Life insurance for mortgage: £200

So we've just wiped out 5 months advantage over renting. At some point something is going to need to be fixed which would be the landlords responsibility. May not be this year but will be at some point down the line. Say the combi-boiler needs replacing at a cost of £2,000. You've just wiped out almost 2 years of savings over renting in one single repair. 

Then you want to move house. You're looking at £1,000's in estate agent commission plus at least a grand in legal fees etc so selling the house to move you wipe out three or more years saving over renting.

Still sure that like for like home ownership is cheaper than renting?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_union

Scotland has 2/3 the oil of Norway, they have a petrocurrency.

Infact, that's another reason for the rUK to be in a currency union - without Scotland's oil the pound would be significantly weakened. 

When you look at all the facts, the argument for a currency union benefits the rUK more than it does Scotland without one:

* Their balance of payments would take a hit, possibly reducing their credit rating even further

That said I do believe Viagogo would be your most realistic option at this stage.

If we're not in with a chance of winning the league, you should find it easy to get a ticket on the day of the game. Get there early and have a mooch around outside the Mercedes showroom on Ashton New Road, just before the entrance to the ground, there are always touts there looking to sell tickets.

It should be a good atmosphere anyway, last game of the season is always a minor carnival atmosphere - unless of course we've just blown the league in the week previously, then it could be a bit of a downer.

It won't be rocking, it rarely does at the Etihad anymore unless it's a big game, but you should enjoy some quality football first hand around real football fans.

true,allhailzorp,null,null,"Norways GDP is nearly twice Scotland's, and their economy is far more diversified. 

Would the pound be weakened if Scotland left? Absolutely. But Scotland only accounts for around 9% of the UK's GDP. It makes more sense to accept a slightly weaker pound, than it does to hand over control of their currency. The UK would have to guarantee the Scottish financial and banking systems, to protect their own. In the case of a Scottish banking crisis, the UK would be forced to bail them out. Without any political control of Scottish policies, they'd be opening themselves to disaster. 

1. A countries current account (BoP), has little to do with credit ratings. Balance of Payments affects interest rates and exchange rates. The UK's credit rating is based on the stability of their economy and currency. Even  if they lose Scotland (only 9% of the UK's GDP), the major financial centers and businesses are in London.

2. True, but the trade offs are not worth it.

3. If anything, the transactions costs would work in the favor of the rUK. Any new Scottish currency is guaranteed to be much weaker than the sterling. Favorable exchange rates reduce the cost of doing business. It would be cheaper for UK companies to operate in Scotland.

There's definitely some sort of time lord security in there. I think the shape of the key is irrelevant, but the physical keys and lock are intelligent, connected to the TARDIS in a way that enables them to recognise each other.

There are theories that the TARDIS exterior is simply a portal that manifests in places and times, while the interior remains stationary in it's own bubble universe. Maybe it's some sort of physical encryption. The TARDIS communicates with the key and decrypts the portal. When the door is locked, the portal is encrypted and doesn't lead anywhere, which is part of why it's impossible to get inside when the door is locked, there is no inside.

Or something. Speculation is fun.


Edit: excerpts from the ""Father's Day"" Tardiswiki page:

So if you remember this ep there's a paradox and there is a wound in time, which basically puts them in a sort of alternate pocket universe thing where the TARDIS doesn't work.

""When he gets back to the TARDIS and unlocks it with his key, he finds it an empty box.""

""The TARDIS key glows hot in the Doctor's pocket, and the Doctor realizes it's still connected to the TARDIS, sparking hope. Although the TARDIS' interior dimensions were thrown out of the wound in time, the ship is still linked to the key and he can summon it back.""

So this sort of supports the theory that the inside and the outside of the TARDIS exist separately to one another, and that the TARDIS recognises the key.

true,[deleted],null,null,"You are aware that strength in a squad extends past the first XI, right? Hence why I said ""most talented overall squad""? If Lennon or Bale went down we were completely fucked because we literally did not have another winger that played. We were incredibly lucky to not have many injuries that season outside of the wing positions because Redknapp insisted on playing the same XI game after game after game. We were a few injuries away from having to start Livermore and Bentley in central midfield. Our depth this year completely blows the depth that year out of the water, and imo the first XI isn't far behind in an injury-free scenario. At the very least now we have adequate cover in pretty much every position. Let's compare second XIs, for shits and giggles.

2011-12:

                   Gomes

     Smith    Gallas    Dawson    Rose

    Gio    Sandro    Livermore    Kranjcar

               Saha    Defoe

Keeping in mind that Rose and Smith were essentially youth team players at the time, Gio didn't start a single game, and Kranjcar is an attacking midfielder, not a left winger. Then look at the second team currently:

2013-14

                    Friedel

    Naughton    Dawson    Chiriches    Fryers

                Holtby    Capoue

        Townsend    Sigurdsson    Chadli

                    Soldado

Assuming Kaboul-Vertonghen is the chosen defensive pairing and Paulinho/Sandro/Dembele is the midfield, with Lamela on the left, Eriksen on the right, and Adebayor as the lone striker. That's the thing though, with the first team I listed there's a very clear first XI and it's very clear who the backups are, while now the squad is all much closer in talent and offers more tactical flexibility. Aside from Friedel and Fryers, pretty much all of those players have made serious contributions to the squad, whereas in the first team I listed, Adam Smith made a whole one appearance, Rose made 3 substitute appearances, and Gio was just generally a waste of space.",0,1398495421,null,0,1398496181,0,ch2faqt,t3_23zh66,t1_ch2faqt,t1_ch2f7bi,null,1433527601,6,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,6

These where not the areas where the losses were incurred that led to the bank being illiquid.

There is no logic or sanity in the way RBS is being managed. Which is saying something considering how badly managed it was before.

true,ultrasupergenius,flair8,,"Tim Sherwood is conveniently glossing over a critical component of Spurs successful performances. 

The players principle motivation through all of his crappy team selections, slights and insults through media channels and interviews has been the knowledge that Tim Sherwood is being replaced at the end of the season.
In a way, Tim Sherwood has indeed inspired this team and several individuals on it to be successful... but that success comes at a price, and the price is Tim's head on the proverbial chopping block.  I am sure when the axe falls and he is on the open market, he can build he ego back up by waxing poetic tomes about his martyrdom at Tottenham.

From my perspective, the guy started as a breath of fresh air, and has grown into a narcissistic windbag focused on protecting his own distorted self image. 

Edit:
On a more positive aspect of Tim's involvement: Harry Kane getting his break, and to a small degree Nabil getting play time.  That being said, the first two starts for Nabil were interesting - the start against Man City was ill-advised and went as expected.  His appearance as a starter in match after match at the expense of some really good players sitting on the bench just boggles my mind - and led to my conclusion that Tim needed to remain a short term gap filler.",0,1398497298,null,0,1398497759,0,ch2foyf,t3_23zh66,t1_ch2foyf,t3_23zh66,null,1433527787,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,thetasigma4,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"1. The Aztecs. A great pure historical either that or Tenth Planet which is probably the most important episode of doctor who ever and is one of the best cybetmen stoties

2. The War Games or The Mind Robber. The first is a long and brilliant story and is also one of the most important stories ever and is very tense and well written and the other is possibly the most creative episode of Doctor Who which shows how it uses its limitations to tell good stories. Power of the Daleks is also great but it lacks images so is considerably harder to get through than the others but it is a great story.

3. Inferno or the Green Death. The first is absolutely superb and the second has some great character moments.

4. You said you have already watched Genesis of the Daleks so i will recommend Horror of Fang Rock and City of Death. The first is a great bleak story and is the only on screen appearance of the Rutans. City of Death is probably Doctor Who at its funniest and wittiest with both Tom Baker and Douglas Adams.

5. Kinda or Caves of Androzani. Kinda is a very good story and it draws off Buddhism for the themes in the story and Caves is a superb story because there are no allies for the Doctor and he is caught up in a drug war. 

6. Vengance on Varos. A very solid story and one of the few from 6's TV run I enjoy (he is much better on the audio plays)

7. Happiness Patrol or Remembrance of the Daleks. Happiness patrol is weird and Doctor Who being very creative again and it is fantastic IMO. Remembrance is one of the best Dalek stories ever and shows seven at his best especially when he talks to the dalek at the end of the episode. I would also recommend Curse of Fenric but i suggest you watch a few other serials with ace in them first so it has far more impact 

8. Movie. Not great but has McGann in it who is great and has possibly the best TARDIS set ever (he is also well supplied with audio plays like six which is where he is better as the stories are better)


Edit: A somewhat extended list without the explanations and a few additions to above

1: His pure historicals are good (IMO) such as The Aztecs, Reign of Terror and the Romans. The First Three serials are also good (including the first Dalek serial. Time meddler I also enjoy. Also the Tenth Planet is good

2: If you don't mind reconstructions Power of the Daleks, Macra Terror, and Evil of the Daleks are Good but if you do the following are also good, Mind Robber, Invasion, War Games, Tomb of the Cybermen, Enemy of the World

3: His entire first series is amazing (IMO) so watch all of that and then maybe Green Death, The Three Doctors, The Seas Devils, Carnival of Monsters and The Time Warrior

4: First series is mostly great especially Arc in Space and Genesis of the Daleks( easily one of the best stories of Doctor Who ever). Then there are Terror of the Zygons, Planet of Evil, Brain of Morbius, Horror of Fang Rock, Terror of Weng-Chiang (unfortunately a bit racist but a good story nonetheless), Sun Makers, Key to Time (Classic Who's first long story arc), City of Death.

5:Kinda, Snakedance, Black Orchid, Earthshock, Cave of Androzani are all good

6:Vengance on Varos and the Trial of a Time Lord (second long story arc Classic who did)

7:Happiness Patrol, Remembrance of the Daleks, Greatest show in the Galaxy an his entire last season are all good

8: Movie unsurprisingly. This is not a great story but Paul McGann is excellent in it",0,1398498436,null,0,1398498940,0,ch2fwfi,t3_240ix1,t1_ch2fwfi,t3_240ix1,null,1433527885,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,Obidom,cnty-uk,Cheshire,"You are aware there is no 'NHS TAXATION' anywhere? NHS is funded from general taxation. Taxpayers have no ability to dictate how or where the Govt should spend General Taxation.

And National Insurance? that pays for your Pensions and Benefits, and the Pensions of those already claiming Pensions, it is not used to [fund the NHS](http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CEEQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parliament.uk%2Fbriefing-papers%2Fsn04517.pdf&amp;ei=-GVbU9PjI4HEPOjNgbgB&amp;usg=AFQjCNHAwhjZg6exgHN7C0CDTKdDYLwBsA&amp;bvm=bv.65397613,d.ZWU) (despite people thinking it does) 

&gt;The majority of receipts from NICs are paid into the National Insurance Fund, which is separate from all other revenue raised by taxation. The Fund is used exclusively to pay for contributory benefits, and operates on a 'pay as you go' basis: broadly speaking, this year’s contributions pay for this year’s benefits. The Government has no powers to use NICs to fund anything else. In their survey of the UK tax system, the Institute for Fiscal Studies comments, “The NI Fund is notionally used to finance contributory benefits, but in years when the Fund was not sufficient to finance benefits, it was topped up from general taxation revenues, and in years when contributions substantially exceed outlays (as they have every year since the mid-1990s), the Fund builds up a surplus, largely invested in gilts: the government is simply lending itself money. These exercises in shifting money from one arm of government to another maintain a notionally separate Fund, but merely serve to illustrate that NI contributions and NI expenditure proceed on essentially independent paths. The government could equally well declare that a quarter of NICs revenue goes towards financing defence spending, and no-one would notice the difference.”

&gt;Since the late 1990s, contribution income of the Fund consistently exceeded payments so that the balance of the Fund’s balance grew steadily (from just under £10 billion in 1998/99 to £50.6 billion in 2008/09). However, the impact of the recession has been such that, as noted above, the surplus is now around £39 billion. In 1992 the Government Actuary stated that the Fund should have a balance of at least one-sixth of benefit expenditure, as “the minimum level recommended with a view to ensuring that a reasonable working balance is maintained.”This would now be equivalent to around £14 billion.

&gt;Since January 2007 the Fund has been fully invested in the Government’s ‘Call Notice Deposit Account’, administered by the Debt Management Office, rather than any part of it being held in gilts. This is an overnight account facility, which pays interest to the Fund at the prevalent Bank of England bank rate. The Fund has maximum liquidity for withdrawals (or deposits) out of (into) the Fund on a day-to-day basis.
&gt;One point to emphasize is that these funds are being held in this account on loan – much as with the purchase of gilts: there is no question of the Government being in a position to use this facility to extract money from the Fund as an extra source of revenue. In addition, the new arrangements minimise transaction costs, whilst still retaining zero credit risk and the guarantee that the Fund will always earn a fair and observable market rate of interest.

&gt;In March 2010 the House debated the legislation to uprate the state pension for the year 2010/11; on this occasion, the nature of the Fund’s surplus was mentioned by the Liberal Democrats spokesman on work and pensions, Steve Webb, who is now Pensions Minister:

*The law only requires the balance in the fund to be one sixth of annual expenditure on benefits. The actual balance in the fund is about two thirds of annual estimated benefit payments. So pensioners' groups always ask us where the money has gone. When we find out where it has gone, it is a bit of surprise. A little bit of the money goes to the national health service, but the law says that most of it must go towards national insurance benefits, pensions and so on. But at the rates in the order, it cannot all be spent on national insurance benefits and pensions. They are not big enough to spend all the cash on, so the balance keeps rising year after year.
Where does the money go? My understanding is that the fund is a bit like a soft bank that lends money to the rest of public sector, so that the Government need not borrow it from elsewhere. Of course, when the Chancellor said in a recent Budget that he would increase national insurance contributions to help fill the hole in the Budget, he was doing so to spend that money not on national insurance benefits and pensions, but on others things, presumably. How can the fund be used as a label and a soft way to raise tax, when the money is not spent on national insurance benefits and pensions? … Is that really what Beveridge had in mind? Did he think that the national insurance fund would essentially become a kind of easy credit option for the Government? We have come an awful long way since the start of the contributory principle.*",0,1398498981,null,0,1398499297,0,ch2fzvb,t3_23yj5e,t1_ch2fzvb,t1_ch1vgc9,null,1433527933,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

And if they pay for these essential services--and most public services are essential, that’s why they’re in the public sector to begin with; to keep them out of the hands of monopolies—now all of the sudden the public services that were provided on a subsidized basis or freely are going to be privatized without any price regulation for it, and all of the sudden people are going to have to pay market prices that include interest charges, Wall Street underwriting charges, the cost of dividends, exorbitant management fees, bonuses for management, political contributions, buying off judges, buying off the courts, buying off the politicians to make sure that the people are not able to stop your gouging them.

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"First of all, it doesn't matter where you go in the EU, people will want mechanics, librarians, nurses, there's a reason why we imported nurses so willingly from the rest of the EU, hell the same can be said for mechanics. These are skilled professions. Importing skilled people drives wages up rather than down, because in sklled professions the employer looks for loyalty, ability and willingness to learn more than they look for cheapness.


I could argue that the whole ""wages driven down"" thing is a lie in itself. For starters, the legal minimum wage is £6.30. If you work for, say a guy who is willing to fire people in order to take on people who work for less then you have a case for employee negligence and could very easily just call the police on him, and if he's willing to be so blatantly abusive to his employees then that means he doesn't care about them, which means he doesn't care about you. 

Secondly, if he's willing to take on foreign labour at massively reduced cost, then by definition he'll be undertaking a lower quality of work, because any work that requires a group effort tends to rely on communication. If you employ five people who all have a different first language and yours is a sixth then getting anything across is going to be difficult, to say the least.

I wonder if I can claim to have watched the most pool games in the oddest places this barmy season?

Like a fool I didn't expect Brendon's tricky reds to defy expectations and so I left my sofa behind and set off to bicycle from the UK to Australia last June.

This meant desperately cycling along, camping most nights on the side of the road, then come Sat/Sun contriving to be somewhere to watch such games as I could. Didn't manage to watch em all but caught a lot of crackers. 

Here's my list of countries:
Switzerland/Italy/Croatia/Greece/Turkey/Georgia/Armenia/Iran/UAE/Oman/Australis(Melbourne-Tasmania-NSW-Queensland)

In detail:

24 July - 0-2 vs Melbourne victory
- in Zurich, Switzerland watching it, laid up in a friends apartment, after crashing my bike into a post woman.

03 August - vs Olympiakos 
- having been robbed of my passport/money/phone etc while sleeping on a beach near Pisa I cycled to family in Orvieto (Italy) just in time to watch the champions elect.

17 August 1-0 vs Stoke 
- Watched Sturridge show he could fill Suarez's boots and that this Liverpool team can do it ugly on a crumby tv with bad reception set up on a dockside in Southern Croatia. Drinking homemade wine out of coke bottles. The pre-match entertainment before the game was a brawl between local Croats and Serbs.

01 Sept 1-0 vs Man United 
Having negotiated the Balkans I reached Thesaloniki in Greece in time to watch Moyes get shown the new pecking order in one of the city's excellent sports bar-come-cyber cafés. Think one screen for FIFA/pro evo another showing the match all lubricated with plenty of booze.

16 sept 2-2 vs Swansea 
Found myself in Cappadocia, Turkey, spending the weekend in a run down old Greek house/ruin/squat which despite appearances had excellent internet! Streamed the game so I and two Spanish reds could lament our missed chances.

05 Oct 3-1 vs Palace 
Took a room in a hostel in Tibilsi where I convinced the Russian owner to interrupt his birthday party to put the Liverpool on his projector so I and a mad Hungarian Liverpool fan could watch while drinking hideous amounts of cha-cha (homemade vodka)

Nov 2 2-0 loss vs Arsenal
Having contracted a nasty bug which laid me up for 3 weeks and would eventually require a home made drip using a hat stand (I had lost two stone!) I watched the mighty reds get schooled over 90 minuted (arguably the only time this season) in a YMCA in a run down Armenian town called Spitak.

Nov 23 3-3 vs Everton 
An Internet cafe on the border between Armenia and Iran may not be the most atmospheric place to watch the derby but with headphones on and this incredible football feast playing out before me I had a wail of a time in Meghri.

15 Dec 0-5 vs Spurs
In the Iranian desert city of Yazd watching on an illegal feed at a friendly Iranian red who had invited me to watch the game at his place. What a performance! Now your gonna believe us!

26 Dec 2-1 vs man city 
in Shiraz spiritual home of Iranian poetry I was lost for words to describe a top top performance which deserved to be rewarded. Watched with a friendly Indian family who all love liverpool having stashed my bike and blabbed my way into a hotel foyer playing the match. Never felt to confident of future success after a defeat.

29 Dec vs Chelsea 
Hard to take after a tortuous days cycling through the mad roads of Dubai I settled down in. Sport bar to see Mou knock us off top spot.

12 Jan 5-3 vs Stoke
Mad game watched in a shack at a Omani fishing village that some how had the match with a bunch of Bengali construction workers.

28 Jan 4-0 vs Everton
What a result! Back in Dubai, this time at the airport, having been turned down for a Yemen visa 

8th Feb  5-0 vs Melbourne
Watched on a laptop at a friends in Melbourne. Sublime. 45minutes of football to rival anything I've ever seen in a red shirt.

23 Feb 3-2 vs Swansea
In Devonport, Tasmania watched on an illegal feed.

3-0 vs Man United. 
After an epic cycle through heavy rains in Gippsland Victoria I found a motel where the owners liverpool supporting son sacked off a romantic night with his Misses to watch the match on his laptop with me. Well worth it!

Had now arrived in my sisters house in Sydney and could watch the Sunderland, Tottenham and West ham matches in comfort and with much joy. What a run. My three year old nephew has been thoroughly converted (despite initial scepticism due to his favourite colour being blue) so much so that he would sneak upstairs to watch the matches with me in the dead of night.

Liverpool vs Man City - 3-2 
Oh me oh my. Out in the boondocks on a cotton farm (St George - Queensland) I managed to find some internet and ran up a horrendous bill streaming this beauty at silly o'clock in the morning. Hiding behind the sofa, dancing round the house and writing a match report to slip under my parents door just before dawn just so when I woke up I would know it was real. It's really happening!

Liverpool vs Norwich 
Back in Sydney and staying for the rest of this magnificent season so I don't miss a kick.

true,bcash,null,null,"&gt; Like for like it really isn't. You're probably prepared to rent a shit hole for a cheap rate, but if you're looking to buy you wouldn't consider the same property.

I expect this is heavily region specific.  But I've seen places sold near me (and checked the Land Registry for the final price), then immediately be listed to rent for 20% less per month than the mortgage repayments would have cost (and I did the maths assuming a 25% deposit too).

&gt; If it was the case that renting was cheaper than a mortgage the buy to let market would be much smaller than it currently is and house prices would not be rising so sharply.

Well, that assumes a rational market, there is a huge speculative aspect to buy-to-let [0].  I expect the buyers of the example properties I checked to either be: a) cash buyers, or b) have found very favourable interest only[1] deals.  In these cases their noses will be above water, just, but will only remain so if interest rates stay low[2].

&gt; I suppose it depends what area of the country you're in though as where I am property prices are rising over 10% year on year right now which is more than you could reasonably hope to make by investing unless you're prepared to take some risks.
&gt;
&gt; Obviously renting has its advantages i.e greater diversity in your investments and flexibility in where you can live , but in the long term if you are going to be staying in the same area its generally advantageous to buy. 

This is the boring truth of the matter.  No-one, with any sense anyway, unless they really like solicitors and estate agents, buys a property for one year.  If you're planning on moving within two or three you're almost certainly going to be worse off to buy than rent, unless property prices grow massively over the same period (which would raise very interesting questions about economics - both the UK economy specifically, and economics as an academic discipline - if it did so without there being significant economic woes elsewhere).

Slightly off-topic comment on the inherent unviability of the buy-to-let sector:

The last time the buying-vs-renting divide was this bad was 2006/2007.  There seemed to be a million (extrapolating from a very small sample size) amateur landlords with negative cash-flow on a monthly basis.  They were happy with this because their ""investment"" was growing by more than that per month.  Starting in 2007 though house price inflation slowed massively, but interest rates came down too, overnight they switched to the opposite situation: monthly profit but no (or even negative) capital growth, so no problems right?

The difference now is that the costs of being a landlord are not going to get any cheaper than they are now.  The costs will either stay the same, or get larger.  The ROI (month-by-month) on all future landlords is small, and will get smaller (and by small I mean negative and by smaller I mean more negative in extreme cases).

Unless rental price inflation begins to outstrip purchase price inflation, of course.  It's an interesting thought-experiment to figure out under what conditions that might happen.  If you can, then that will almost certainly be the way to make proper money in the property market in years to come.

[0] there always has been, of course, as with all investments.  But it does seem to be getting worse, people are buying properties with no safety margin (on month-by-month basis) solely for the purpose of anticipated capital gains.  All this done at a time of record cheap mortgage costs and a dirge of alternative investment options... It's quite easy to develop a negative outlook for the medium-to-long term viability of buy-to-let.

[1] which makes sense of you're buying-to-let, but doesn't really work if you're buying-to-live.

[2] even the cash buyers will be affected by interest rate rises, as such things would only be possible if the economy as a whole improves, and there would therefore be a wider variety of investment opportunities available.  The opportunity cost of a cash purchase would become significant.",0,1398509076,null,0,1398509806,0,ch2hhhg,t3_23xrba,t1_ch2hhhg,t1_ch1zi22,null,1433528701,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

No. Sure they say they're Christian but never go to church.

Since Anglicanism is the state religion it's a de jure Christian nation and since [59.3% of the UK is Christian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom#Religious_affiliations), the UK is a de facto Christian nation.

That being said, religion has absolutely no place in politics as not everyone holds the same faith or any faith at all. I don't believe there are very many Britons at all who believe it should be, either. This attitude is reflected in the Lords Spiritual who attend the House of Lords and abstain from voting on non-religious matters.

I honestly don't see any reason to alter this system at all. The UK is culturally Christian and the Anglican church is an enormous part of British culture. The religious side of our culture and society are perfectly harmless. As a Christian myself I know plenty of other Christians and considering the high number of Christians in the UK, so does probably everyone else. What makes this a non-issue is that religion in the UK is a private matter, so you can go through your whole life probably never hearing of religious matters unless you accidentally turn Songs of Praise on or wake up during the Queen's Christmas speech.

true,Dick_Harrington,scot-Lothian,Edinboro,"&gt;I think this parochial separatism just doesn't fit in with the transient nature of the modern world.

That's an interesting statement because presumably it implies you are in favour of further integration - beyond nation borders (if nation borders are transient these days; which arguably they are in Europe)

I feel like pursuing this line of thought because it ties in directly with a debate currently being held in England around UKIP and membership of the EU. If we are to truly accept that 'separatism just doesn't fit in with the transient nature of the modern world' - then in the same breath we also need to accept that further integration with Europe is inevitable vis-a-vis the 'ever closer union' clause within the Treaty of Rome.

So whilst I think it's fine for English folk to talk about separatism in the case of Scotland, or Ireland, being backward - despite the fact that the SNPs civic culture (as opposed to ethnic) movement is something scholars will probably talk about for generations if independence is successful - I think they need to remember that that there is a bigger fight going on in their own backyard right now over Europe using the *exact* same logic.

I say this because currently, there are a lot of people who have completely different opinions of Europe and separatism within the UK. Contradictory opinions, actually. I'm not saying you fall into this category by the way, you could be pro-EU in which case your argument is entirely respectable.

FYI also: I feel at home anywhere in Scotland more than in England, and I feel like Holyrood represents me more than Westminster. So my opinion is the opposite of yours, obviously.

This difficulty in defining religion is also what makes it so hard to represent other religions in the House of Lords. Since they only vote on religious matters (and as members of the House of Lords are practically powerless anyway), I believe this is a valuable tradition that brings greater autonomy to the Church of England, and ways to represent other major religions must be found.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"My theory is that many people that say they're Christian just remember school assemblies and the constant indoctrination and pressure that they represented, and Christmas and Easter celebrations from when they were young, but couldn't tell you much about Christianity beyond that, and maybe the Garden of Eden story and Noah's Ark and the Lord's Prayer that they had to recite.

After the Dark Ages it was a hangover from the Roman Empire's influence after Constantine and then the need to show loyalty to either Rome or Henry the eighth and his successors version on that particular day - or do otherwise would get you killed. Skip to the Industrial Revolution and it was all hammered into them as part of a twisted way you're told you can avoid poverty as you can't live off the land any more. Then it's a Victorian morality hangover in the early 20th century and forward to the 50s/60s/70s generation the school assemblies offer the basics and the Lord's Prayer as a duck and cover like mantra to help fight off the fear of the four minute warning of atomic doom.

There's nothing especially British about it all. Just a kind of memetic attempt at maintaining social cohesion that worked occasionally.

Yes, of course, there were and are 'proper' Christians, but it's mostly something that's been handed down unthinkingly as its useful.

For all her other faults, I think that the one person most responsible for the decline in Christianity in Britain is the Queen. She's the first monarch to not just take an interest in foreign affairs by not just going off and kicking a few heads in around the globe, but actually being seen to engage in a friendly way with other cultures and showing a lead there. She's also inchingly slowly moved towards secularisation with her comments about 'going quietly' if the country did democratically decide to become a republic and having very little to say about morality being exclusive to the religion she represents.

So Cameron and especially Gove's version of Christianity - along with that of many others - is a product of their early education, akin to the rules about how to make tea properly that we'll complain to /r/Britishproblems about if broken. It's a result of schooling and the laws about assemblies that were imposed by political agendas, not positive choices about the benefits of Christianity. When it is a choice, it's *mostly* a choice to conform to what's perceived as a majority view. Like supporting Manchester United. 

But - and as I said, I think the Queen possibly does have a lot to do with it - that approach is on the wane and is and will continue to decline, so matter what politicians educated in archaic elite establishments who like the idea of conformity, so long as it's to the version they're happy with, currently have to say about it.

TLDR - School assemblies are to blame. The Queen DGAF so is letting it slip.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"Honestly? Not that upset.

I know people we're stoked for a manager of his stature, but I firmly believe there are more risks here than people realize.

1) he's never coached in England before. This constantly gets overlooked, but it's important. Look at Manuel Pellegrini's struggles to get city to perform consistently; I believe firmly that's because of the level of fight in all the teams.

2) part and parcel with that is that he has been out of club management for years. International management is very different, and LvG might need time to settle in. Time he likely won't have because...

3) he's only going to have a month or so free before the season starts. With the Netherlands set to make a run at the World Cup, van Gaal may not be available to take over until mid/late July; that is a very small window in which to buy the players he wants, make sure he knows the players and staff, and install his system, which could backfire because...

4) he's 62, and Louis van Gaal. If, for some reason, his high-pressing, possession based game just isn't working, he's not changing his system. This is what he does, and it works (at least in his mind) everywhere, so why change it. If it doesn't work, it's the players fault.

I'm not saying any of this will be a problem, simply that it can be. I still want van Gaal, he's a top-class manager. But I'm not 100% convinced.",0,1398517197,null,0,1398529008,0,ch2ivj6,t3_240wpa,t1_ch2ivj6,t3_240wpa,null,1433529359,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

true,Smaale,null,null,"&gt; Will the defence improve? Thirteen clean sheets (two against the top four) and a reasonable 48 conceded with fairly average players is a decent achievement from Sam this season, could a new manager do even better though?

Defence is Sam's only asset. He knows how to park a bus, and is the only reason we have so many 0-0 draws

&gt; How could the style of play be improved? Surely with Carroll and at times Cole up front, direct football will still be played as Carroll's presence in the air is too good to waste?

I'm sorry but Sam doesn't even try. If you read his latest article, in which he refuses to change our playing style, its evident that he's deluded. He seems to think he's being unfairly branded and his style is fine.

&gt; Would the morale of the team be any different? There were problems with Nolan's discipline in the past, but the team seems reasonably happy.

Only happy people are a few of the regulars, even then, not all of them. Players that I see as being happy with their roles are: Nolan (must be loving it), Reid, Noble, Tomkins, Demel, McCartney, Adrian and Downing. 

Jarvis, Nocerino, Armero (maybe), Diame, Morrison, Carroll, Cole, Joey Cole, Vaz Te and some of the youths are, rightfully, frustrated under Sam. Only ""Sam players"" will be happy with us at the moment. If I'm being honest morale looks nothing near happy. Look at Morrison, under a manager that isn't incompetent he'd be in Nolan's place and we'd have probably put him on a new deal for a two more years. 

&gt; Where can we realistically expect to finish next season and the years following that? It's nearly three years since we were relegated, surely finishing around the mid table is somewhat of an achievement? Or should we be aiming higher, basing ourselves on Southampton and pushing for a Europa League spot? Obviously that would be great but is any manager we're likely to get going to be able to achieve that?

Midtable is fine, but not if we're playing the shit football to get there. Usually, you have to find the right mix between good football and good results. If you've noticed, we're getting neither. I 100% believe that Gold, Sullivan, Brady and Sam will all be gone by the time we've moved after we get bought by some bored Arab. It's the only way to go forwards as a club now and honestly I don't care. We'll push on then, hopefully with someone else having a fall of grace.

Telford gets a bad rep because, frankly it's pretty boring, but I've lived in worse places.  What we call the 'town centre' is actually a huge shopping mall with the usual chain stores, but there is some redevelopment going on at the minute that is attempting to give it a less 9-5 feeling  - the Town Park is great too, you can spend hours walking and spotting old industrial revolution relics.   

edit to mention the Wrekin, our natural landmark. http://www.virtual-shropshire.co.uk/bm~pix/wrekin-2011-01~s600x600.jpg   A hill sticking up out of nowhere, is a lovely walk to the top (about 30-60 minutes depending on fitness) and the views from the top are stunning.  Get to the Wrekin by heading toward the Wellington area of Telford, Wellington also has loads of Indian restaurants if you fancy checking out our 'national dish'!  

Its proximity to the lush countryside and pretty Shropshire towns is great.   Ironbridge is a must, the museums are great, wonderful places to eat and drink and it's very very pretty.  Ludlow is great too, full of history (and some Michelin starred restaurants) and a lovely castle.   We're very close to the welsh border so I'd check out Powys castle perhaps, it's only about an hour away from Telford by car.

Or are they just in a better position to tell everyone make do you bread crumbs from the table? Not sure what you're getting at and can't be arsed to argue..It's late, ave had a cider or two cos tomorrow is my one day off out of 7 (for my daytime job) Then 4 nights a week in my second job. Skint as fuck and can't even spell lzay. Sorry,that was an undeserved rant/vent there, no offense meant

I'm just quoting this here so you can't edit it and get rid of it later.

If you want nice things you either need to buy them or make them. If you can't afford to buy them, and you aren't willing or able to make them, you can't have them.

The guy suggested that you literally buy a piece of card, buy some black spray paint and buy a cheap doormat. There is like 0 creativity involved in spraying using a stencil.

* [Doormat for £5](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/80047635/) 
* [Spray paint for £5](http://www.ebay.co.uk/bhp/matt-black-spray-paint)
* [White Card for £2.99](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/A3-WHITE-CARD-SMOOTH-SILK-and-PLAIN-CRAFT-Card-available-250GSM-1-500-/221274632047?pt=UK_Crafts_CraftingPaper_EH&amp;var=&amp;hash=item3384feef6f) 

Based on those prices you can get what you want for £12.99, which is less than half price then you asked for. 

If you literally can't be bothered to cut out some letters from a piece of card, and then whine about how you have to work multiple jobs to make ends meet while drunk, then I've got no sympathy for you.

I've had to work for everything I've got, no money from parents and was kicked out of my home at 21. I learnt early on if I can't afford to buy something, and I can't be bothered to put in effort to get it some other way, I can't have it. I suggest you learn that too.

Overall, no one player really stood out as particularly bad or particularly good on either team. We deserved a draw not because we played well but because Southampton were as poor as us, which is a pretty sad thing to be able to say.

Probably one of the best defensive performances I've seen from Baines all season, no one had any luck going forward against him, although he had no luck going forward himself.

Deulofeu, as someone else said in another thread, didn't do much wrong by being selfish, he was just outclassed by Clyne at full back today. McGeady will be a class act when fully match fit and a bit more used to playing for the blues, can ghost past players no problem and unlike his Spanish counterpart has the ability to play a final ball.

Mccarthy and Stones' performances go without saying every week, class acts both of them. One or the other will be captain in the future, can't sing their praises enough.

Aye wasn't implying anyone was being negative, more just trying to keep the comments a bit more upbeat cos it gets pretty negative in here if we perform below our usual standards which irks me a bit to be honest.

Unfortunately I think the same in regards to 4th place. This is really our best chance at it for a while I reckon this year.

true,Errant_Tree,,Grave before Shave,"I've been around the block a few times vacation wise. However, probably the most fun you can have is to come down to Florida. I may be biased since I live here, so let me explain myself.

There's a free park of sorts called Universal Studio's city walk. Free admissions, so it stays with the budget, and you guys pay for what you want. You can go watch a movie, or even play mini-golf. It's in Orlando, and there are plenty of parks there.

Now if you're planning on traveling around, you can make a long drive down to the Florida Keys, or perhaps the Everglades park. Pack bug spray, as the mosquitoes are out in force this part of the year, as well as the sand gnats. 

Personally my favorite thing to do is to go to the beach here. Look up St. George island, and see if you can book a room at the Buccaneer Inn. It's right by the beach, so you can just walk right out there. There's plenty of nature parks to go and have long walks through with your buddies, but you'll need to call ahead for those rooms I imagine. Tourist season is coming up and it'll get crazy. Also, plenty of nice restaurants from the slightly expensive Blue Parrot, to a beer, wings, and pizza place. If you want to keep in budget, you can even buy your own groceries, although I think you only get kitchens in the suite style room. Depending on how many people you have that may be an option.

Oh, and don't forget the pretty ladies at the beach ;)

Good to know there are proper blues on here, was unsure about bothering to post on this subreddit, but I'm new to reddit and exploring.

I don't think Hart is worse than 12 Premier League keepers, if you read back I said half a dozen, ie 6.

To name them? In no particular order;

Mignolet.
Cech.
Lloris.
De Gea (oh yes).
Begovic.
Howard.

I've said this to a lot of the lads who I travel away with, and I used to get loads of stick for it, but they're slowly coming around to my way of thinking.

Just in these past few weeks Joe has made two key errors which led to a goal. Mile off his line at Anfield when he shouldn't have been, Sterling slots it into an open net to give Liverpool the lead. Beaten at his near post, pathetically, against Sunderland to give them a 2-1 lead with ten minutes to spare.

Not good enough.

Too many errors to list from the entire season, I really wouldn't like to, as it would just fuck me off. I'm still pissed off about the one at Stamford Bridge, which cost us a point at a stage in the game when we we looked more likely to score, and gave Chelsea an additional 2 points that they didn't deserve.

I cannot begin to describe how angry I was getting the train back after that game.

I'd had enough at that stage, nothing I've seen since has softened this stance, in fact everything I've seen since has just reinforced it.",0,1398522980,null,0,false,0,ch2kdsj,t3_23zhra,t1_ch2kdsj,t1_ch2jrfd,null,1433530064,6,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,6

Defense has been pretty solid. Stoke have had some good moves, but with Kaboul and Dawson in central defense, they're playing into out hands a bit.  Paulinho has been doing a solid job of mopping up the midfield with Chadli.  Hugo has been brilliant as always.

Naughton and Rose have been pretty good.  Rose has put in a couple decent crosses, and obviously was on point for the goal.  Naughton has been solid as I've come to expect form him out there on the right.

Ade has been all over the pitch today, very good.  People call him lazy, but he's got the best workrate and covers the most ground of any lazy player I've ever seen.  Honestly, that's a lazy criticism.  Kane is thinking too much I think.  Needs to settle down and just play his game.

Eriksen has been doing his thing.  Not as much an impact as he's had the last couple months, but he's always got the quality.  He'll make something happen soon.

Lennon has been poor.  I'd never try to argue that.  But he's not been only poor.  He's had a couple decent moments, but really shouldn't last past the 60th minute unless he really turns it around.  He's not playing nearly poorly enough to be pulled at half for me.

&gt; No, it's the complete opposite. What you're describing is government interference in the marketplace; economic liberalism shies away from this and believes that in general capitalism works best when business is allowed to manage its own affairs. 

Ahh okay thanks for clearing that up!

&gt;There are many in the Lib-Dem Party who would approve of such a policy, but it's certainly not their current way of thinking.

Would the Labour party be the closest party to this 'social-democratic concept' then?

&gt;Lib-Dems are, as the name suggests, far more democratic than the other major parties

So overall, theoretically, the Lib-Dems are closer to the actual 'democratic society' we live in, the entire membership can influence policies, in comparison to Labour/Conservatives who have a select, smaller number of people from the membership who can influence policies?

&gt;However even if that were to happen I expect that the party leadership would point out that they're the junior partner in a coalition government 

So realistically, the Lib-Dems in this coalition have little influence over current politics compared to the major partner, the Conservatives? 

So in short, UKIP are just a fresh face of politics, who are definitely pragmatic and know how to play their cards well to gain the voters and support they need?

We also have no plan b. When we're playing against an equally physical team we can't adapt.

A new manager might realise that instead of getting it to our wingers every single fucking time we should maybe try and play through the middle. There's constantly space between the lines against lower teams that we never exploit with Big sam at the helm. I would hope a more tactically astute manager would be able to see that and bring more technically gifted players in that could exploit that space. Instead of Nolan EVERY SINGLE GAME. I hope a new manager would also be able to mix it up and change with each game. Sometimes going down the wings and crossing, sometimes more directly through the middle, sometimes maybe get runners from deep in the midfield breaching their back line and looking for a through ball.

I know our players aren't the best but they're also plenty capable of playing much, much better. We have Nocerino for example, who has shown he's very good on the ball and can pick a pass and yet he's never used under Big Sam. He continues to play Nolan who has been piss poor every game of this season except maybe 2.

Having said that, if we get Pardew i will rip my fucking hair out. He's exactly the wrong type of manager and would be a step in the wrong direction. Hes terrible tactically. ",0,1398525886,null,0,false,0,ch2lb67,t3_240ypo,t1_ch2lb67,t3_240ypo,null,1433530502,1,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,1

In the same issue Viz ran a short strip called ""The Nice, Honest Gypsies"", featuring a kindly Gypsy woman selling pegs door-to-door and helpfully returning forgotten change.

Jason Wilcox has done a fantastic job this year and the winning record at U18s level is a source of real pride in the Club and community.  

The final game against Chelsea might sound great at 4-0 but they fielded 8 U15 players as they have the FA Youth Cup coming up so it was to be expected.  

City win today as a result of Everton drawing but we've dominated the league all season and pretty deserved Champions in my opinion.

The U18s now have to go into a playoff with the top two from our Noerthern Division and the top two from the Southern Division to determine the overall champions but even outside the randomness of cup games, we've been the best team all season.

On the other hand, the semi-compulsory segregation allegedly involved providing a substantially higher lifestyle to those so treated, such that it became something people seemingly willingly underwent, and it also only lasted until those individuals underwent a public health education and demonstrated that they were prepared to respond responsibly to their HIV status.

I don't say it was a good policy, indeed it was at the very least paternalistic, if not outright authoritarian, but it was a response to what was seen at the time as a serious public health threat, if not an emergency.

Our centre mid pairing is fantastic but if you play them 90 mins every game for 35 games, of course they are gonna burn out. I think we are lucky that they didn't burn out earlier. 


For today's game, we never got it going. Of course, having conceded an own goal in the first minute would that to you. It feels like they didn't recover from that at all. Without Mirallas, we didn't have an outlet to kickstart our counters. With all the talk of Lukaku not fitting our system, think about Deulofeu! He slows the play down, does his stepovers, and produce no final product. We need someone more direct and dribble with a purpose rather than dribble for dribbling's sake.


Also we were sluggish in terms of closing down our opponents in the middle of the park. We were almost always one step slower. It's been a long season and it's certainly understandable.


I think today's result was due to fatigue which stems from lack of depth. Of course the early own goal didn't help either.


I think we need to take a good hard look at the anchor/centre mid position during summer and really address that.

I think a lot of people, including nationalists, are not quite aware of exactly how different the setup around taxation and charging in the RoI is. I’m aware of it, as I’m a homeowner and ratepayer in NI, and I lived in Dublin for a year a while back (and still visit homeowning friends there on a regular basis).

For every tax in the UK which has an equivalent in the RoI, the RoI rate usually works out higher. For example, in the UK the 40% higher rate kicks in on your taxable income above £32,011. In the RoI, the equivalent upper rate – 41% – kicks in at EUR41800 which at the current mid-market exchange rate is £34,403.72. However, because (for a single person) the tax credit is EUR5500 or thereabouts, the proportion of income paid at the higher rate is greater.

Those on lower incomes also pay more tax. In the UK someone on minimum wage pays almost no tax. In the RoI half of their income would be subject to tax.

This is excluding the effect of the Universal Social Charge. Almost all Irish taxpayers, ie anyone earning over EUR16000-ish, has to pay a 7% flat tax on their entire income on top of whatever other tax they have already paid as regular PAYE income tax and PRSI. There are lower rates for those earning less (eg part timers and students doing summer work etc) but these are taxes that are paid irrespective of tax-free allowances etc.

On top of this, Irish citizens also have to pay :

- bin collection charges

- there are no rates, but an annual property charge has been introduced, and water charges are around the corner

- It’s EUR55 to see a a doctor. Further charges for prescriptions.

- car taxes are higher. My car costs £220 to tax in NI, it costs EUR750 to tax the same car in the RoI. (I wonder what insurance costs look like)

- In the UK banks tend not to charge transaction fees when you are in credit. Not so in the RoI. My friend with an AIB account gets charged 35c to make a cash withdrawal and 25c for every direct debit which comes out. I’ve never paid bank charges in NI, as I’ve never been overdrawn.

- broadband and mobile phone is more expensive. The most basic UPC package in Dublin with broadband, phone and TV is EUR53 monthly (with usage allowance). Here I am paying £30/month for my Tivo package and no usage allowance.

- if your house goes on fire and you call the fire brigade, they will charge you a call-out fee. Sometimes your home insurance will pay this cost.

- the price of a pint is 10-20% higher.

- parking penalties are high and in Dublin they are everywhere, even at small shopping complexes in the suburbs where they will clamp you at the drop of a hat and charge a EUR100 release fee. This happened to someone I know out at Leopardstown Valley.

- I was in St Stephen’s Green shopping centre last week and was charged 15c to take a leak! Then I was charged EUR8 for two hours of parking.

In exchange, RoI citizens benefit from better social welfare rates (or so I’m told – I’ve not checked, as I’ve never been on the dole in my life) and the ability to purchase their annual bus/train/DART/Luas ticket free of tax. It “feels” like public transport costs are a bit lower as well. When I used to take the #18 to work in Dublin it definitely covered a lot more distance for less money than the nearest equivalent Citybus service at the time.

The reason for the disparity in taxation is simply Irish government policy. The punitive tax rates are required to maintain the ongoing low levels of corporation tax, welfare spending, subsidies for third level education, and to continue bribing the overpaid public sector unions (especially the transport and teacher unions) not to go on strike. The taxes are also required to pay for the Fianna Fáil government losing its backbone and caving in to European pressure to bail out German and French pension funds invested in dodgy banks.

You could quite easily argue that this is a price worth paying. Ireland’s economy is recovering well from the recession. The reasons for Ireland’s economic success are various; low corporation tax is a factor, as is having a well-educated population, but it is probably more to do with the fact that Ireland is home to the Eurozone’s only native English-speaking population and that makes it attractive to Eurozone investors. During recessions Ireland tends to see high rates of migration, which help to reduce the social welfare burden on the State during the time when it is least able to fund it.

However, I hasten to point out that so far Northern Ireland’s nationalists and persuaders for a united Ireland are showing no sign of accepting the economic tradeoffs that contribute to the RoI’s economic success. Many of the charges paid in Ireland above could be introduced in NI, and used to (for example) offset corporation tax, or invest in education or promoting FDI. That’s what makes me wonder if they have other reasons for avoiding discussions of what a united Ireland would really look like in case it would scare too many nationalist voters off.

Remember his interview afterwards too! Haha.

He turned down Chelsea when we were shite too, and signed contract after contract to stay here.

I will be sad to see him leave, as he's the last player at the club to have been with us when we were in the doldrums. He knows what City are about, I just don't get the same impression with Joe, he comes across more like the established English players who are all dislikable cretins, if you know what I mean.

Micah will be leaving though, because he no longer makes the grade. And he wants to play regularly.

It's cut throat. I don't think Joe should be any different, particularly because it's such a crucial position.

I can't agree at all that he has more top days than poor days, that Dortmund game has been practically an anomaly over the past two years. There are countless occasions this season alone where he has directly cost us points, and besides that, his average performances are poor.

Bog standard keepers can have a day where they're peppered with shots, and look like a world beater. I don't think that would then be enough to consider them world class. Although that's not to say Joe is a shite bog standard keeper, but you get the point.

For example, the flip side to the argument presented here is that the republic has massive levels of debt which severely limit it's borrowing power, the EU is no longer funding them as much as during the 90s boom years that allowed the artificial inflation in wages and the artificially inflated wages mean the they are completely uncompetetive in many sectors, which has resulted in wage stagnation.

NI has a completely different set of issues, it has a lack of foreign investment and doesn't have control of it's own taxes, so it can't manipulate it's taxes to encourage foreign investment like the republic has done. Then again we have very low wages and cost of living, which is a massive asset in terms of bringing in foreign businesses.

What would happen if there was a UI? Would our wages go up to match those in the republic and drive out all the companies in sectors with very tight margins, like manufacturing, and yes, the call centres?

And first thing I did after today's defeat was log on to the Villa website to look for tickets for next Saturday, despite it involving a 250 mile round trip for me. 
But you're right about the atmosphere the last few years, it's been poisonous rather than inspiring a lot of the time. That could really cost us next week. Because we have this assumption that we're too big to go down compared to other teams fighting the drop, our crunch home game will involve a very nervy crowd who will quickly get on players' backs if things don't start well. Contrast that with the support that the so-called 'smaller' clubs will get in their must-win games and you can see why they're the ones with all the momentum. I'm with you, we all need to turn up in numbers next week and support the team as passionately as ever. The Hull match is as big as any trip to Wembley or semi-final we've had in recent years, we need to go there with that mentality, support the team and try and roar them over the line.

Usually only if you specifically ask for it, as this costs a lot of money and with no guarantee of finding out anything (as records are so old and many are lost or perished). Conveyancing solicitors would rather you just stump up the insurance premium.

To make things even more ridiculous, if a check *was* made to find out whether a property is liable, and finds out that it is, you're not eligible for the insurance, and are pretty much fucked if the local rector wants to replace the church roof.

Most people don't bother going to church, but they will still go through with a Christening, church wedding and funeral just because it's what everyone is doing. I myself am an atheist but I know many people that would classify themselves as Protestants or Catholics and say that they believe in God and pray to him but they don't go to church on regular basis.


I think that at the back of their mind most of those people have no need for religion in their lives, but it's already there to some extent and they don't feel the need to abandon it.

Are we a Christian country? Well kind of. Most of us have been brought up on Christian values, been taught some of the mythology at childhood and been to church at some point. But I think that as a country we are also very secular in the sense that we might know what the church preaches but we don't really take it to heart. Most Christians that I know consider themselves to have a relationship with God and not the Church as an organisation; seeing no need for any sacraments or rituals.


Are we becoming more secular? Maybe, it's hard to tell. From what I've observed of people at my age (19) most are agnostics or non-practicing religious. Very few would openly go out and say that they fully reject the notion of gods.

**Second World War History**


The three black triangles represent the three spires that have been a part of the city's skyline since the 14th century. Coventry Cathedral was almost completely destroyed during a German air raid (only the spire and outer walls survived), this damage is reflected by the white stripe running through the central spire and ""breaking"" it.
The white stripe over the black stripe reflects the light of tenacity and recovery in the darkness of war. The three spires also point upwards, reflecting Coventry's recovery from the war.


The use of red reflects Coventry's relationships with Volgograd and Dresden, as red was used in the flags of the countries they are in at the time of the cities becoming twined (USSR and East Germany) and is still used in the Russian and German flags today.


**Representations of modern Coventry**

**Second World War History**


The three black triangles represent the three spires that have been a part of the city's skyline since the 14th century. Coventry Cathedral was almost completely destroyed during a German air raid (only the spire and outer walls survived), this damage is reflected by the white stripe running through the central spire and ""breaking"" it. The white stripe over the black stripe reflects the light of tenacity and recovery in the darkness of war. The three spires also point upwards, reflecting Coventry's recovery from the war.


The use of red reflects Coventry's relationships with Volgograd and Dresden, as red was used in the flags of the countries they are in at the time of the cities becoming twined (USSR and East Germany) and is still used in the Russian and German flags today.


**Representations of modern Coventry**


As previously mentioned, the black triangles represent the three spires of the city and the ruins of the cathedral. Red and green are Coventry's civic colours, the red represents two of Coventry's twin cities and the green represents Coventry and the greenbelt/countryside that surrounds the city on all sides.

true,Melberger,null,null,"Lloris is tailor made to play in a team with a high-line, he's good with the ball at his feet, he can play it out of the back, and he reads danger expertly. Couldn't name amount of times I've seen him leave his line and intercept a dangerous pass with composure and dominance.

On the reverse, Joe cannot interpret when to come, he just gets a rush of blood to the head and steams out like a wrecking ball - good example would be the Villa winner and Chelsea's winner at Stamford Bridge.

Lloris has an intelligence Joe doesn't.

I genuinely think the only thing Joe has left in his arsenal is a good reaction save, that requires no thought. A good example would be from Gerrard's header at Anfield the other week, but then in the same game you see his flaws - like coming off his line thoughtlessly, giving Sterling the opportunity to just take a touch and slot into into an open net to open the scoring.

Besides that reaction save, Joe Hart is an average keeper.

His positioning is poor - regularly gets beaten at his near post.

He flaps at high balls, and rarely catches.

He hesitates when he has an opportunity to initiate a counter attack with an early ball after we've been defending in our own half - because he just doesn't see the pass, he doesn't have that intelligence.

His kicking is poor.

His concentration is poor, and causes him to switch off.

His passing is terrible, he's really uncomfortable with the ball at his feet. And for a team which prides itself on possession and playing the ball out from the back, it's a critical weakness.

Those are historical flaws to his game, that he has always had.

In the past two years, his shot-stopping (his primary strength on which he built his reputation) has deteriorated to the extent where he is often getting beaten by shots that average goalkeepers would keep out.

His game is now strewn with errors, spectacular ones, and down right moronic ones.

I believe arrogance crept into his game. Joe was always at his best when he had something to prove - trying to be England's number one, trying to displace Given as number one.

Once he got there, and had his place in both respective sides, and so much was predicted of him. I think he let it go to his head. He didn't work on his weaknesses, and he's allowed himself to get complacent. He's actually regressed, considerably.

And I think it's time to put any sentimentality aside, and replace him with a much needed upgrade. An upgrade who'll fit our style of play and breed a sense of calm assurance among our defence. Joe is not that player.

I firmly believe that had Valdes not ruined his knee, he'd already be on his way here.

Now the future isn't so clear, Pellegrini might risk another season, or he might keep Joe simply due to misplaced faith and his homegrown status and popularity with most of the fans.

true,[deleted],null,null,"generally i dont like it, for a number of reasons.

i think its selfish and irresponsible short term thinking to use immigration to increase the younger demographics (and therefore taxpayers) to pay for stuff like pensions and public services as we live on a small, high population density island, overpopulation is a worldwide problem and if we choose to keep having a growing population to save us having to take a hit for the generations before us spending, the longer it goes on the worse it'll be down the road for us or our descendents, i dont want this generation to be the next baby boomer generation with that kind of me me me and fuck the kids thinking.

i also dont think it should be used to fill skill gaps, or more, the native population shouldnt have been allowed to have such skill gaps in our workforce, once again the short term easy way out is taken by the governments we've had so rather than doing anything to sort out education (particularly non uni stuff) so that it was fit for purpose, or doing anything to combat the cultural forces that lead to too many of the native population being unsuited to all but the most basic work (drinking culture, ned culture, benefit culture, general mediocrity culture), they just take this dismissive view towards swathes of native people like ""fuck you guys, you're useless and replaceable"" when governments themselves are the people responsible for creating and residing over it, the people who the government and society write off dont just vanish but sit around causing problems and are basically just a huge well of wasted potential. in short, it's the screwing over and abandonment of the native working class.

then there are reasons of culture, personally i like the culture of the place i live, i think there's a connection between people around here (north scotland) to one another as we live similar lifestyles, share a lot of common experiences, know our own history, people help and talk to strangers here because i think they feel the same way, they can relate to one another, they care about each other and the areas they live in more. it's not the richest or most vibrant place but theres a good community and culture here, people get by, there's low crime, higher trust between people and folk are relatively happy. i think if significant amounts of immigrants came here that would change as people would feel a lot less connection to immigrants other than basic human connection, immigrants would bring their own cultures and stick to them most likely because they would probably find it hard to ""get"" the local one.

you already see it with poles in some places, some folk will go to work and hardly talk to anyone because almost all of their colleagues are poles, talking polish. you also get a lot of english retiree immigrants (half the time seem to be running from multicultural paradise london themselves), some places are majority old english folk from the south of england who have no interest in fitting in with the local culture because there are so many others like them for them to hang around with, who'll treat you like some strange novelty for speaking in the local accent and basically not being from SE england yourself. recently had roma begging and picking pockets in inverness, which is a pretty friendly city where people get on and talk with each other, stuff like that just ruins that trust and sense of community between people. im sure an influx of immigrants would be overall good for the local economy but whats the point? we'll mostly be better off and yet will lose half of what the area has going for it.

anyway i dont really have anything against immigrants personally, i can understand the motives and everything, i just dont think it does a place much good to have a lot of new folk all at once, a trickle of people is best as it forces newcomers to integrate and doesnt lead to everything changing so quick that the locals are suddenly a minority in their own area, a good example would be indians in the highlands, there really arent many of them but the ones there are seem to be almost all very integrated, they are well and truely part of the local culture, if you discounted their ethnicity you would think you were just talking to another highlander.",0,1398536926,null,0,false,0,ch2pfjz,t3_23ywwz,t1_ch2pfjz,t3_23ywwz,null,1433532514,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

true,mosestrod,null,null,"This fetishises form over content, similar Gas or Rail nationalised institutions in other countries are not only cheaper but more efficient, in fact one of the central problem of these is nearly all the major costs of these are paid for by governments, yet the profits from them goes to private companies (i.e. British rail is subsidised to the tune of billions, major infrastructure to rails, airports etc. are financed by central or local government and then only sometimes paid for by the relevant private companies and even then usually at way under the price).

The traditional way governments, of all stripes, have privatised utilities and services, built up over years, is by underfunding them (it happened with every privatised service, it's now happening to the NHS). Underfunding increases the public’s contempt for them and eventually paves the way for privatisations justified on 'capital injection' or 'efficiency' and so on. 

The mantra of privatisations is all about competition yet all these government utilities etc. functioned in a market, just think what a state owned energy company would do to inject competition into the informal cartels of the hegemonic energy companies. That doesn’t mean there weren’t problems, but state owned enterprises can help customers and value things like low prices and good quality without instrumentalising those things to the prerogatives of capital or the market, as private companies must. Fundamentally though, any nationalisations should be rather socialisations, that is putting service etc. in the hands of people, not government, placing them under workers and social control through decentralised, participatory, and directly democratic federations, i.e. syndicalism.

The issue is not so much with ads on Reddit. As we can see, the advert was not very popular and the advertiser deleted their account because it bombed so much. They likely won't waste money advertising here in the future. 

The issue is with the increasingly fluffy ads on TV that offer speed, convenience, minimal fuss. It's telling people that borrowing money isn't something you have to think about, just do it on impulse. Have you ever wondered why we have such a high level of consumer debt in this country? It's not because our citizens are stupider than the citizens of other countries... 

Limits on advertising, limits on interest charged and better financial education in this country is what we need. Not lassaiz-faire do-nothing. Our country has a problem with debt and it needs to be addressed, not allowed to fester.

Like it or not people are easily influenced, especially when businesses spend billions per year researching the best way to penetrate the minds of their customers. The media and ease of credit play a huge part in why we have such a big problem. 

Noone is asking for David Cameron himself to come round our houses and hold our hand as we fill out a loan form. What we need is sensible regulations to reign in the payday loan companies and a start to tackling the real debt problem in this country, household/consumer debt.

The President of the European Commission^1 is the head of Government of the EU - equivalent to the UK Prime Minister. The President is in charge of the Commission, which manages the day-to-day operations of the EU, comes up with proposals for legislation, enforces EU law (where applicable) and generally runs the EU. This is similar to the way the Prime Minister controls the Cabinet (equivalent to the other Commissioners) and all the various Ministries and Departments of the UK Government.

Following changes in the Lisbon Treaty, the next President will be elected by the European Parliament - rather than simply ratified by them. As such, each of the European Political Groups have put forward their candidate for President^2 and most of the candidates will be present at the Debate on Monday.^3 The Candidate from whichever Group is able to command a majority in the Parliament following the elections (whether outright, or with support from another Group) will likely be elected President.

This debate gives us a chance to see who we are voting for on 22 May.



Some background stuff
-----

Because it may be of interest to some people, here are some of the differences and similarities of the President of the Commission and the UK Prime Minister;

Both the President and PM get a seat on the European Council (the 'Head of State' of the EU), although the President doesn't get to vote.

The President is (now) elected directly by the European Parliament, while the PM is appointed by the Queen based on who can command a majority in the House of Commons. This has the same overall result as the President's appointment, but the EP gets an actual vote, while the House of Commons's approval is assumed based on negotiations between the Parties.

The President has no inherent powers - all his or her powers come from the EU Treaties. In contrast, while some UK legislation gives the PM specific powers, many of his powers come from the Royal Prerogative (previously the 'divine right of kings') or conventions.

While not prevented from doing so (as far as I know - I may be wrong), Commissioners - including the President - do not also server as MEPs. The EU tends to uphold (and may be required to - again, I'm not sure) the principle of separation of powers; whereby no one person holds an office in more than one branch of the government. In contrast, while arguably not a requirement, the Prime Minister is expected to me an MP, serving in both capacities throughout his term.

Pantillimon isn't shocking, he's a reasonable keeper, and much better at dealing with high balls and playing it out of the back. He deals well with pressure and doesn't welt like Joe does when the pressure is on. I'm glad that he got his big day and played in the league cup final.

By Joe's distribution I mean every aspect; decision making, long kicking from goal kicks when he could just play it short, his inability to play it out of the back with the ball at his feet, particularly if there's any hint of pressure. His lack of intelligence when he has an opportunity to initiate a counter attack by releasing the ball early, instead he hesitates and the opportunity vanishes. And his long kicking, which can be good, but can also be staggeringly terrible.

I might come across as harsh, but I think my criticisms are valid and I've given detailed reasoning for them.

Kompany's had a reasonable season, if you were being harsh you could say poor by his standards, but he's a top player. He's been somewhat inconsistent this year, could be mitigated somewhat by having a alternate partner at centre half very often, and a lack of protection from midfield, plus we play a much different style of play than we used to, notably with a high line. But his style has always been front foot and aggressive, stepping out of the back and winning the ball, when he gets it wrong it can stand out while other errors centre halves make are less noticeable to the average fan.

He's still a key player to the side. 

In fact, an unsung hero of late has to be Demichelis, he was awesome at Anfield, really marshalled Suarez well.",0,1398539685,null,0,1398539976,0,ch2qip2,t3_23zhra,t1_ch2qip2,t1_ch2q08w,null,1433533025,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1
true,melboy91,null,null,"First thing to say is that Pearson has been quoted as saying ""You probably haven't heard of anyone we're looking at."" This scans, as Walsh and Pearson have spent at least the last year with a policy of bringing in unheard-of European youngsters in an almost Arsenalesque way or bringing in old heads (GTF, KP) to help give us the experience to achieve promotion. In short, the fat will be trimmed (KP to a coaching role, GTF out I reckon) and the youngsters will have a summer to prepare themselves physically and mentally to be shoved about the league. Maybe Pearson is looking at some slightly older players to bolster the midfield, but he's still implying that they're not from the English leagues.

That being said, we need Premier League experience in the team or we're going to be outclassed. Pearson would be stupid not to raid the teams looking at the drop, because half of their players will not play at a Championship level. Soooo:

**Gary Hooper - Norwich**

Not exactly the most prolific striker in the world, but he's shown touches of class and brilliance that I think will only continue as he gets more used to the conditions of the Prem. He's a hungry, Vardy-esque striker and I'd personally love to see him and Vardy either side of Wood in a front three.

**Robert Snodgrass - Norwich**

We have two or three incredibly good prospects on the wing in Knockaert, Mahrez and Dyer, but what Snoddy would bring is a different breed of midfielder - pinpoint precision passing and brute strength. He runs like a freight train and it's hard for him to hit top speed, but that's not the position we'd play him in. If I was Pearson I'd almost be tempted to look at playing him in the centre of the park; he's more than capable of doing the job.

**Steven Caulker - Cardiff**

Caulker is hands down the most exciting young English centre-half in the Prem, with the exception of John Stones perhaps. Powerful, fast, and with a better touch than some midfielders, he also poses a good goal threat at the other end. Would love to see him and Wes partnered up until Liam Moore 'comes of age' a bit more after Wes gets too old.

**Emmanuele Giaccherini - Sunderland**

Too good a player for Sunderland to begin with. Needs a manager to calm him down, sort him out, and unleash him at a defence. Sort of what I think Pearson should be doing with Knockaert - allowing him to play in the hole behind a solitary striker.

**Pajtim Kasami - Fulham**

Not too sure about his overall qualities, but he can rifle them home and has a pretty good range of passing. Not entirely the most mobile person though. Maybe.

**Mats Moeller Daehli - Cardiff**

Has only been with them a few months and hasn't really had a chance to prove himself in a sub-par team. I know it's a much weaker league but he was apparently outstanding in Norway and he seems to show signs of real natural talent (see that goal vs. West Brom). Maybe another option to play as an advanced midfielder in a 4-5-1.

**Connor Wickham - Sunderland**

Not much to say. Big fella, strong, does a job. Chris Wood if Woody had a touch more pace and finesse. I think he has a big future.

**Christian Benteke - Aston Villa**

Villa won't go down, they have too much about them and the teams below them are too weak to claw themselves out of the mire. But just an 'if' moment. 'If' they go down, then fuck yeah do I want Benteke. I'd sell my firstborn.

I don't think we should move the capital. That would be madness as well as quite unworkable.

First of all let's focus on the romantic. Parliament and Westminster are one of the oldest, still-existing, homes of Government in the World and that is a pretty nice thing to have for tourists and for our own sense of history. There is something compelling that our current politicians sit in chambers that link them with their predecessors across generations. There is some pride in looking at one of the oldest homes of Parliamentary democracies in the world when you look at Whitehall or the Houses of Parliament. This is something we would not get by moving Government to a identikit office block in Birmingham or Manchester. Also the Government is symbolically close to Buckingham Palace so that would cause an issue as well. Finally London is one of our oldest cities and the one most closely associated with our nation. This would be like France moving the Capital out of Paris or Italy out of Rome. It's been, one way or another, the capital of England (later Britain) for most of our history and it's a long history. 

Now on on the practical. It would cost so much and for such little gain. London's status as a capital has meant it's uniquely suited to this task with a mass transportation network, several rail stations out and into the City, the largest airport in the country and another two biggish ones in addition (which still isn't enough) plus all the buildings used to support the functions of being a capital city (including the aforementioned ones that have been there for hundreds of years). 

I guess the thinking behind moving the capital would be in order to see similar infrastructure built elsewhere but that wouldn't be feasible. These developments have built up slowly over hundreds of years. Buckingham Palace was built in 1703. Parliament has been there for nearly (iirc) 1000 years albeit it was rebuilt in the 1800s at some point. The Underground is 150 years old and has been developing ever since. The cost of recreating all the transport networking, finding new locations for Whitehall departments and M15 and M16 is just too much. 

Finally what do we do about all the Foreign embassies and companies that have set up London? Tell them to move? 

We can't ""move the capital"". 

Instead newer industries should be promoted elsewhere in the UK. We should build up the transport network to ensure there are minimal penalties to being located elsewhere from the capital (HS2) and start regional hubs for various types of industry. Manchester would do well as a media capital. Maybe another City could be the move of a Tech hub? We could see how we could encourage some of our Northern cities to be homes of Manufacturing again and so on. 

However London is our capital and an asset to the country. We need ideas that help develop other cities instead of ones that are designed to handicap London out of annoyance or envy.",0,1398540039,null,0,false,0,ch2qnoc,t3_241pwt,t1_ch2qnoc,t1_ch2pzsu,null,1433533092,30,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,30

You really don't want to get into a habit of using the card for anything else though. You don't want to max out the card with other frivolous purchases and end up paying 30% interest on it for ever more. If you take this option, you should probably destroy the card after the initial purchase so you aren't tempted to use it for anything else.

Changing the capital city would mean moving the administration. Not anything else. You don't need to recreate a transport network. We already have quite a comprehensive transport network everywhere. The country is hardly lacking for space move to. Being near Buckingham Palace doesn't matter. How often does the Queen go to Parliament? The Prime Minister could still do a weekly meeting. Why would companies need to move? Yeah embassies can move if they want. It's not as if a lot of them don't already have consulates around the UK.

Changing a capital city isn't unheard of. Brazil and Australia made theirs out of nothing, Italy moved its from Turin to Rome, when India became independent New Delhi became capital when Kolkata had been the main administrative centre before then, and Nigeria did it in 1991.



By creating the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly we even have experience of creating and moving capital cities (in terms of their administrative issues). The EU also successfully managed to create a capital city.

Where else has a transport network that is as suited to the needs of Government as London? A place where all 650 MPs and Foreign dignitaries can reach easily? I don't think there is a place as suited to that as London. 

&gt; The country is hardly lacking for space move to.

No but we have a pretty historical place already. 

&gt; Being near Buckingham Palace doesn't matter. How often does the Queen go to Parliament? The Prime Minister could still do a weekly meeting.

Well this was filed under romantic rather than practical. The idea is that the Monarch is located close to her Government. Obviously that doesn't matter much in the modern era but historically it's a nice touch. As our the fact that a tourist can see the Palace, and No 10, and the Houses of Parliament all within walking distance. Much better than some office block somewhere. 

&gt; Yeah embassies can move if they want. It's not as if a lot of them don't already have consulates around the UK.

but why? There are bloody ton of Embassies in London and some of them are chosen, again, for historic reasons. 

&gt; By no means am I saying we should change our capital city. But it is certainly possible to do.

It's possible but not practical or cheap. We would need to move a significant amount of Whitehall departments and Government organisations. All the Departments and the Ministry of Defence, MI5, M16, The Commons, The House of Lords, No 10 and the Treasury. I imagine we would foot the bill for the 163 embassies that would need to be moved. Not to mention all the auxiliary functions of Government that exist dotted around the place.

We need to encourage investment and industry elsewhere. Not spend a shitton moving something for which we've already got a home that works.

History is important. We don't bin it on the pretence of being current. The Government isn't legislating to protect the corn laws. However I simply said it's nice for tourist and citizens alike to look at a historic building like the Houses of Parliament and think that it was the birthplace of Parliamentary Democracy and it is in that historical chamber that our Government sits. We want our policies to be current relevant and hip. We want to keep our buildings from centuries past, and make use of them, because many countries would love to have such a rich history. It's something for Britons to be proud of and tourists to visit. 

&gt; Like Russia moving the capital out of St Petersburg, like Brazil moving the capital from Rio, like Japan moving the capital from Kyoto, like the US moving the capital from New York or from Philadelphia. It's been done before, in countries older than the UK.

So? A lot of those countries may be older than the UK but they had signifiant upheavals that warranted their capitals moving. The USA has pretty much always had it's Capital in Washington DC as a Independent nation. The previous locations where either the Continental Congress (Philadelphia) or were only intended to a stopgap after Independence (New York and a bunch of other East Coast cities). I believe Russia moved it as a tactical decision in WW1 and just kept it. I don't know why Brazil moved or Japan. 

&gt; Yes we can. Just the government. Not all 8 million people. Not the transport system, not everything.

We can but it is impractical and expensive. It is not in the realm of realistic suggestions. 

&gt; Wow, that's a new idea.

Well it's one that is feasible and would actually help and hence it's not a popular notion in a thread that seems less about balancing out the centre of the economy and more about having a pop at London.

In my girlfriend's village in Slovakia, there was literally one house occupied by gypsies, and you could spot it a mile off - that would be the house with so much shit outside it that you can barely see the front door.

My girlfriend's mother came to visit us recently, and on the bus to the airport she saw a couple of Roma gypsies harrasing an old woman for most of the journey.

Basically every big town and city. If you build it they will come is very appropriate here. 

&gt;No but we have a pretty historical place already. Well this was filed under romantic rather than practical. The idea is that the Monarch is located close to her Government. Obviously that doesn't matter much in the modern era but historically it's a nice touch. As our the fact that a tourist can see the Palace, and No 10, and the Houses of Parliament all within walking distance. Much better than some office block somewhere.

I think most people want a government concerned with growth and prosperity of the nation. Not a government that is a tourist destination. And tourists could still see those things. Nobody is going to say ""actually, you know what, I don't want to go to London to see the Palace of Westminster because David Cameron won't be there"". Tourists still go to the Palace of Versailles and the Roman Forum. This would be no different. These structures and their history is not eliminated. Creating a new parliament doesn't mean a new office block either. Look at Cardiff, Edinburgh, Canberra, New Delhi. They might not be to your taste, but they are statement buildings nonetheless.

&gt; but why? There are bloody ton of Embassies in London and some of them are chosen, again, for historic reasons.

And what? ""Sorry we won't move our capital city because Argentina has a historical attachment to its embassy in London and it would be sad to leave"".

&gt; It's possible but not practical or cheap. We would need to move a significant amount of Whitehall departments and Government organisations. All the Departments and the Ministry of Defence, MI5, M16, The Commons, The House of Lords, No 10 and the Treasury. I imagine we would foot the bill for the 163 embassies that would need to be moved. Not to mention all the auxiliary functions of Government that exist dotted around the place.

Moving capital city wouldn't mean moving every single Government department and executive body. MI5 and SIS don't need to move. GCHQ, the DVLA, the Met Office, Ordnance Survey, the Army, Navy and Air Force aren't in London already. There are probably more people working for government departments outside London than in it. Even if it did mean moving every part of it. The rental values of those offices on Whitehall would be huge.



Your reasons for not moving the capital are based on tradition, transport and tourism. Tourists don't stop visiting. Transport exists and can be improved. Tradition is tradition and doesn't help anything grow and develop. The investment encouraged, and other economic changes, by a radical move such as this would be way beyond anything else.

Again I put this category under 'romantic' and 'historic' which may be a dirty word in the utilitarian world of Reddit but is still important to others. Yet History does help us be more effective. We learn from it and if it surrounds us we might remember those lessons or find strength in it. 

&gt; No-one wants to knock it down. The building will still be there.

And they're far more compelling if they're still relevant. Parliament is much more interesting as the historic seat of Parliament if Parliament is actually located there. No 10 is much more interesting as the Prime Minister's residence if he resides there and Buckingham Palace is much more Interesting if the Queen actually sits there. The Palace is much more interesting to tourists than Versailles and that's in no small part that we still have the monarch there.

You have obviously had a nice gap year...

Yes poor people don't always want beans, but tinned tomatoes/or kale require a stock cupboard of herbs/spices and essentials that could make a meal out of these. 

Yes this does come down to education and obviously the turkey twizler saviour has tried to educate, but for some people deciding to spend a couple of quid on a few herbs, and then spend an hour prepping/cooking  a main meal every night is not realistic.

Take a walk around waitrose(other supermarkets are available) and you will see a collection of meals that either include a portion of veg or meat already marinated.

People are also time poor, you, sorry the article couldn't try to suggest that it is only the unemployed who are monetary poor, because people who fall into both brackets will not have the resources/time nor education (see waitrose comment before jumping on this) to make a substantial meal out of a tin of tomatoes..

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Basically every big town and city. If you build it they will come is very appropriate here.

Not really. Most big town and cities will have a direct train to London. They may not have a direct train to Manchester. Also they will come presumably we then need to support the network to do that. I am all for investing in regional transportation but it should be used to support new developments and regional industrial hubs rather than a Government retrofit. 

&gt; I think most people want a government concerned with growth and prosperity of the nation. Not a government that is a tourist destination. And tourists could still see those things. Nobody is going to say ""actually, you know what, I don't want to go to London to see the Palace of Westminster because David Cameron won't be there"". Tourists still go to the Palace of Versailles and the Roman Forum. This would be no different. These structures and their history is not eliminated. Creating a new parliament doesn't mean a new office block either. Look at Cardiff, Edinburgh, Canberra, New Delhi. They might not be to your taste, but they are statement buildings nonetheless.

Well first of all the lack of a Monarchy does hit Versailles. It is less interesting if it's not current. Besides if we have those buildings there then use them for their historical purpose. 


Moving capital city wouldn't mean moving every single Government department and executive body. MI5 and SIS don't need to move. GCHQ, the DVLA, the Met Office, Ordnance Survey, the Army, Navy and Air Force aren't in London already. There are probably more people working for government departments outside London than in it. Even if it did mean moving every part of it. The rental values of those offices on Whitehall would be huge.

Doesn't the Government own Whitehall buildings? Anyway you probably need to move the departments that require proximity in Government. I would say that means any department that is headed by a Minister if not it's supportive organisations (i.e GCHQ). As for MI5 and M16 I imagine they require proximity to each other, the MOD and No 10 although I am not well versed in how often they interact (obviously). 

&gt; Your reasons for not moving the capital are based on tradition, transport and tourism. Tourists don't stop visiting. Transport exists and can be improved. Tradition is tradition and doesn't help anything grow and develop. The investment encouraged, and other economic changes, by a radical move such as this would be way beyond anything else. It isn't going to happen of course. Nobody is realistically suggesting we change our capital city.

Tourism is more effective if the link to history is still manifested today. We get more tourists at Buckingham Palace than the French do at Versailles but since we're keeping the buildings and we have no good reason to move then let's use the buildings we have now. It's what they were built for. Tradition is important and it does help us grow and develop, it enriches our culture.

I agree it won't happen and the OP seem to be realistically suggesting it and this is the most substantial discussion on the thread. Every ""London is too big"" discussion seems to focus on what won't happen. Nothing on what could and should happen to help develop other cities.

true,ivanabiteyourfinger,cnty-scotland,Englishman in Pictland,"The problem is they aren't represented in any meaningful way in politics or the media, so the drive to reverse racial stereotyping isn't really there. 

As recently as the 1980's, Saturday night TV had men in ""blackface"" dancing at prime time and the following week had a gollywog on children's TV. My daughter had one. Being a white family living in a part of the world with very few non whites, I wasn't even aware then of how offensive this was until years later when the problems of racism were being brought to the public mindset.

This is still to happen for travelling folk. It's still an acceptable stereotype on British TV, but there have been some advances. I think we all now know the term ""pikey"" is offensive, but it's a word that still pops up in the media now and again.

Although postcurtis and others have said racist things here (if you don't think it's racist anyone, substitute the word ""gypsy"" for ""jew"" or ""black"" and read what he wrote. Still feel the same way?), I can't help but consider how ignorant I was to the suffering caused by racial stereotyping that I didn't understand was a problem.

Agree, for the major laws, yes it does, I was being a bit overreaching there.

true,mostly_posts_drunk,cnty-england,comfortably numb,"This hits a little too close to home for me as it describes my circumstances almost perfectly. I spent months being unemployed due to rural location and lack of jobs in the area, I presume like /u/lithaborn while on JSA I casually mentioned that I was considering self employment, and was almost thrown into it (albeit quite voluntarily of course, but if it seems if you even mention self employment while on JSA they really do jump on it)

But I happily went through the process and took out a loan, and right now i'm just about making enough to pay the bills... just. And I have to say that this blog rings extremely true where the author speaks about increasing numbers of people going self-employed for lack of any other options, I did, and so far this year I've noticed I have a few more competitors in my area who weren't around last year.

Possibly at least partly because of that increased local competition I've seen a noticeable drop in customers and income over the last few months, and in fact I've just recently looked into applying for Working Tax Credit myself.

So while this might just be a bloggers opinion matching my own singular anecdote, if he's correct then this could be a ticking timebomb indeed, esp. for people who are already financially struggling with being self-employed, or those who are using part time self employment + WTC as a means of bare-minimum income in place of benefits.

Is Buckingham Palace more popular than Versailles?

Versailles: 5.7 million visitors.
Buckingham Palace: 420,000 in its peak year
Windsor Castle: around 1 million
British Museum: around 5.4 million.

Now admittedly Buckingham Palace is only open over summer since it's a working building. Which is why Windsor Castle is there since it's open more often, but Versailles is still more popular combined. I've added the British Museum for two reasons: it's full of history and you seem into your history, and it's also the UK's most visited attraction. 

My conclusion is this: Versailles lack of a monarchy does not detract from its attraction to anyone, and nor is its historical significance diminished.

Where can the City of London override Westminster law? 

&gt; It is.

The article seems to suggest that it's a taxation black hole because the companies inside it store their profits off-shore. They can do this irrespective of where they are in London. It does compare it to the Cayman Islands but that's not a valid comparison as the Cayman Islands really do have a different tax regime. 

The whole thing seems to be using 'The City of London' as a noun for the finance industry but the region itself doesn't have devolved taxation or legal powers. The Corporation of the City of London does campaign for it's members' interests to central Government but it's Westminster's power in the end. 

If Westminster decided to tax them all to hell there is little the City of London (the authority) could do it about it.

Secondly, are you saying that financially Scotland would be worse off under independence? That has been routinely proven to not be the case. Even without oil we'd still be up on the present situation. 

Thirdly, any argument based around ""London makes a lot of money today"" is only because historically that has been where the national focus is. If you build rail, air links, provide subsidies for business (particularly finance) and place most of the national museums and attractions there then of course that's where the most income will be generated. We're thinking long term, we'd like *some* of that focus and under the current UK political climate there is zero chance of that happening. 

I'm worried about what's going to happen when the oil runs out. This will affect something like 20-30% of our industry. Under Westminster rule the policy when local industry is failing the reaction has always been London focused. When Thatcher's deflationary strategy switched the UK from a manufacturing export nation to a financial services one the focus was entirely on places like Canary Wharf to provide for the new jobs. That is zero use to a miner in Yorkshire. I'm not saying that Thatcher's plan to end most exports was ""bad"" for the country as a whole (with the rise of far-eastern manufacturing it may have been a wise move), merely that the way it was handled was not done with non-Londoners best interests at heart.

&gt; Is Buckingham Palace more popular than Versailles?
Versailles: 5.7 million visitors. Buckingham Palace: 420,000 in its peak year Windsor Castle: around 1 million British Museum: around 5.4 million.
Now admittedly Buckingham Palace is only open over summer since it's a working building. Which is why Windsor Castle is there since it's open more often, but Versailles is still more popular combined. I've added the British Museum for two reasons: it's full of history and you seem into your history, and it's also the UK's most visited attraction.

Yeah but these numbers aren't comparative. They don't include the changing of the guard or people just visiting the outside and taking pictures. Versailles you can just 'go' but the Palace you cannot. Versailles is readily accessible. The tours for the Palace aren't. Now the British Museum you need to go inside and therefore the visitor numbers are easier to measure and suddenly we have 5.4 million. Does it really make sense that the British Museum gets 10x the visitors of Buckingham Palace?  I'll try and find it for you but I believe the guestimate of the Palace's tourist including changing of the guard is nearer 7 million.

This can be done in a respectable and lawful manner however the lifestyle of being a traveller encourages the use of crime, begging and/or scamming. This leads to a high crime rate amongst gypsies which then lowers their reputation, which then makes it more likely for gypsies to turn to criminal activity to make money.

Why do I think Brits would behave better than 8000 people who moved into perfectly good flats and within a couple of years had turned them into a dilapidated shithole, where the buildings are literally falling apart and there is near 100% unemployment? You actually want me to answer that? 

I don't even know why I should answer it - it's fucking obvious the Brits wouldn't turn a place into a shithole like that. You'd get some bad people in a group of 8000 of course, but the majority would try to find work and contribute. And I'm not focusing just on Brits to try to make out they're superior - I think almost any ethnic group would try to do the same thing. 

Gypsies have a reputation for this kind of thing everywhere they go - it's part of their culture to steal from non gypsies, it's who they are. Show me another ethnic group that has a reputation for stealing and criminality that's anything like on a par to Romani gypsies - I bet you can't.

Prejudice exists for all races, of course, but just because some people are prejudice against different races, doesn't mean that all ethnic groups are exactly the same.

I've told you that I used to defend gypsies when my girlfriend ranted about them - I was embarrassed by it at first. But I can't deny the stuff I have seen for myself.

And once again, you say this here:

&gt;I've seen examples of poverty throughout the world and history, and usually it's just how you described these flats, so what makes you think this is a culture?

I've already explained to you that the flats were perfectly good when the gypsies took over them. They were in a good condition - and most other groups would keep them that way. Not gypsies though - and I'll tell you this - I reckon if you gave a large enough number of gypsies any property like this anywhere in the world, you would end up with a very similar, if not identical result.

I'm sure you think I'm just a racist or whatever - but I can't deny reality no matter what. If it were all down to the prejudice of the local community, you'd expect cases like this to be isolated to just some areas. Can you show me any significant population of Roma gypsies anywhere in the world that has integrated well into their environment? Serious question. Prove me wrong.

The fact of the matter is that they're not even spending as much as they could get away with for London. 

Also, 'local services' takes on a completely different meaning when discussing London and Scotland. The larger area and terrain of Scotland makes it much harder to offer local services. 

London has a population density which is about 3 times that of even Edinburgh. If you really want to compare Scotland to London, then Londons population density is about 89 times higher than Scotland.

Unbelievable when you consider first game of the season we slumped to a 1-0 defeat at Southport and could barely buy a goal in the opening few games, only winning 2 of our first 8. After a poor 2-1 defeat at Wrexham I dont think anyone envisaged what was to follow, 27 games unbeaten, exceptional football at times and more than a few teams absolutely steamrolled.

John Still deserves huge credit, a hugely underrated tactician I dont think its coincidence that some of the signature wins of the season, Hereford, Nuneaton and Kiddie especially we scored most of our goals in the 2nd half after he had made adjustments and substitutions. A top manager in this league who has changed so many things for the better. 

So elated to be finally out of this league, its certainly been an interesting 5 years.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; We have massive disillusionment with the political class right now. To restore confidence it will take something or someone revolutionary. I think moving the House of Commons might just do it. Perhaps we could create it anew as part of one of the planned Garden cities?

I don't think the disillusionment is with the location but rather the people in the house. As well as the fact that the British are rarely not cyclical about politicians anyway. I think people wouldn't understand why a ton of money is being blown moving the Government elsewhere when their are buildings already there. Why not build more schools, hospitals might be what they say (ignoring the fact those are more ongoing costs).

We can't move to a Garden City as they are smaller towns and are off-shoots from a City so take longer to get to from elsewhere. (Manchester &gt; London &gt; Ebbsfleet etc). 

&gt; Admittedly very challenging to move like this. Even if the public are on board convincing the political establishment to do such a thing would be near impossible. However if such a thing were possible it could be a political rebirth. We could move on from the scandals and the lies to build a truly modern political system. A political establishment for our own century rather than the 19th so to speak.

Why would moving buildings cause a political rebirth? It's the same politicians elected in the same way. I really don't see how it would end scandals or birth a new political system. They couldn't even get AV passed. 

&gt; Conveniently the Palace of Westminster is in desperate need of renovation which could require both Houses to relocate for several years. So we may get an opportunity soon. At the very least we should consider the permanent relocation during this time.

It's already been doing and besides we'll keep the building anyway.

That's not a counterpoint you're taking your experience with a few gypsies and trying to pass it off as a fact that applies to the majority. I mean what's your argument? I know some cool gypsies therefore gypsies have all abandoned their culture and integrated into modern society? It's a terrible argument.

&gt;doesn't mean I put on my kevlar jacket and hot pants to visit Liverpool.

Maybe not. Do you go to bad neighborhoods and wave wads of fifty pound notes around? Do you not take reasonable precautions around people you don't trust? I'm not saying you need to strap a safe to your back when you go near gypsies, i'm just saying maybe keep an eye on your stuff. Is that so unreasonable?

I don't think people in poverty can't cook, I think it is across the board and even though you acknowledge it being time poor is a major contributing factor,but on your initial reasoning.

how much stock cupboard items are donated to food banks that would make someone choose a tin of backed beans against a tin of tomatoes.

Burma and uk have very different food history's, you can knock up a tasty spicy fish with a lime dressing with noodles which is healthy, delicious and dirt cheap in Burma, try asking for a Sunday roast with carrots/broccoli/green beans and peas, see if it is practical.

I think you have the wrong angle on this, it boils down to education/time/cost issues, food banks and the perceived dumping on the poor because tomatoes aren't well received are with good intentions but a little naive.

The way BT Openreach systems work is you don't actually use a telephone number to place an order, you use addresses. Each address is graded. Gold is the best and means they know exactly where the house is. Silver and bronze usually mean you'll need a surveyor to go out and confirm the address location. When you place an order, you put the postcode in (which may not always match what the Royal Mail and you use for post but that's a whole other ball of crap) and a huge list of addresses will appear that are vaguely like the home address someone is giving. Flats are always listed in an odd way, and Scottish addresses are an entire world of pain, so it's easy to select the wrong one. If the system detects that a line is present, no actual engineer will go out and see that the address is wrong so your line is taken over without you wanting it to go anywhere. 

The ""fun"" part is, even if you had seen that email saying you're leaving, it might not have made any difference. OFCOM regulations state you can only stop a transfer request twice. On the 3rd time, the losing provider has to allow the transfer to go through. 

Another way that lines can be slammed is through the engineer cutting the wrong one in the exchange. Your provider gets an unsolicited cease (basically any cease they haven't initiated), but don't get the chance to tell you / try and save you. The line just goes dead on your side and on their side they're left with a disconnected line. 

The chances are they're telling the truth when they say that they can't tell you who has slammed you. The losing provider isn't notified about who the gaining provider is. If you have a working line but it's not with who it should be, dial 150. It will ALWAYS go through to the customer services of whoever the line is active with. The only other ways to find out is wait for an invoice from the new provider, or speak to OFCOM (but it can take them 6 weeks to locate who the provider is). 

If you've been slammed, then your provider can't legally increase your charges by making you return on a new tariff. You had a contract in place with them for a set price. If the tariff you were on is no longer available, they need to match it as best they can and give you the money for the difference. They also can't try and say your now in a new contract term. They might try to, but OFCOM and Ombudsman Services wouldn't take their sides. In fact, the Ombudsman Services had an entire session on those very points at a communications providers stakeholder day not too long ago. 

From how quickly your line came back up, I suspect it was never actually disconnected. If it was disconnected, then PlusNet have used a Directors Service Office request at BT Openreach to get it back up which they can normally only do for vulnerable people (or people they lie to BT about and say are vulnerable to try and get expedited connections). 

Best thing to do is just go straight to the CEO's office the second you think you've been slammed. Normal agents have no power to do anything to try and rescue telephone numbers (they can get lost during slamming), correct contracts or offer compensation. All they can do is transfer you to sales to place a new order to come back to them. 

TL;DR - slamming is usually via postcode, they can't change your tariff post-slamming, always go to CEO's office.

To be honest I could talk to you about the dynamics of coalition politics for hours. The reality is that the smaller party has disproportionate amounts of power. The Lib Dems got a lot less MPs and votes then the Tories, but if they threatened to pull out of the coalition it would be like a game of chicken. Who is more likely to allow the coalition to collapse and why.

Imo with the current government early on the Lib Dems had a lot of power, the Tories wouldn't risk losing their first government in 13 years, whereas if the Lib Dems drop out of government because of principle no one would think any less of them, and they don't really lose anything.

Instead they put all their eggs in one basket with the referendum on PR and blew it. The specific problem with the tuition fees is they LITERALLY promised not to raise them very very publically (meaning everyone remembered the broken promise) and it was a promise to their biggest voting cohort (students). Breaking that promise was a huge mistake politically.

&gt;Do you mean by this he's more 'down to earth' as a person and more 'relateable' so to say?

Very much so, that's his biggest strength.

&gt;That easily realised... I mean I'm at Sixth Form (last year) at the moment, and there really are only a few people who have actual knowledge of current politics, purely the fact we have never been educated in it at all, which honestly is really bad.

At 6th form I took politics as a last minute decision and never regretted it, then went on to do it at degree level. High School and even primary school NEEDS to teach our kids about parliament, how it works and why voting is important. Otherwise how will they care?

&gt;Interesting how this is said and then you have the current situation of the rise of the tuition fees and possible even further rises in a few years, which is supposedly putting people off university, sort of the wrong direction the country is supposed to go haha.

The tuition fees in the first instance were fine, it wasn't much and it went towards education. The problem was instead of using the fees to overall increase education funding, it was used to reduce it and balance it off with private money. 

The biggest problem with it is most students these days will probably never pay it back, meaning it costs more then when it had lower fees.

Also education needs to be all about relevant education. Too many people funnelled into university and not enough into vocational qualifications and apprenticeships.

""Travellers: Do you want

* To be respected rather than discriminated-against?
* Improved employment prospects?
* More opportunities to participate in the way the country is run?

If so:

* Treat the places you stay with respect: Leave them how you found them, or better.
* Treat permanent residents in the area in a way which will make friends, not enemies.
* Use public infrastructure with care and consideration for others""

If travellers went a little further than merely cleaning up after themselves and did something as simple as some voluntary litter-picking and weeding in the parks they drove onto, they would be welcomed rather than viewed with dismay. As it stands, every site I have seen them leave behind has been strewn with litter including used nappies, gas canisters and *an entire portaloo*, with plants planted by the council for the enjoyment of local people completely destroyed.

It's a difficult moral quandary. I'm as anti-discrimination as they come, and yet I don't recall ever having heard a single positive experience about living near a traveller site from anyone ever. There isn't anything inherently wrong with not wanting to live in a static, brick-and-mortar home. Hell, if I could I'd love to live in an RV and tour for a year or so at some point (though of course that would be without the cultural tradition, though one can certainly question whether an appeal to tradition rings true from someone who lives in a 2006 Abbey Aventura). There are a huge range of different lifestyles which are acceptable (to most) in society today. The strong antipathy towards travellers doesn't stem from a blind, bigoted hatred of their lifestyle. It stems from the way they, with seeming uniformity, treat the places they park.

I won't make a comment about crime spikes, because I don't have any evidence to suggest that these occur in areas with travellers, and certainly there will be a range of cognitive biases in peoples' anecdotal experiences of crime (heightened awareness of criminal activity when travellers are known to be nearby, for example).",0,1398554250,null,0,false,0,ch2w63g,t3_241261,t1_ch2w63g,t1_ch2kr06,null,1433535751,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

**Blink**

The four angels are potentially being perpetually created out of a time loop.  Sally takes photos, gives them to Ten, photos become angels, traps Ten and Martha in the past, etc.

These four are weak because they are freshly created as adults.  They are trapped in an unknown environment. They are a small squad doing the best they can to survive off of easy prey before trying to go for the big kill in the form of the Tardis.

TL;DR: These angels are starving, feral wolves/special unit.


**Byzantine**

These are a bunch of rampaging/rioting angels.  They were all trapped, sealed, starving to death (though very, very, very slowly).  Then their buddy crashes a ship full of the bestest and greatest food ever.  They're back in the game.  They are storming through the place like college kids after a grand football game.  Years of being near death they decide just to wreck havoc instead of worrying about food.  They don't need to eat the clergy, they just want to wreck some shit.

Oh, wait, their ""food"" (the crack) is actually deadly.  Shit, better run....

TL;DR: These angels are rioting bro-angels after the biggest kegger in their lives after scrounging for food for only the Time Lords know how long.

**Angels Take Manhattan**

I always saw this as standard angel behavior.  We see babies.  The hotel is their nest.  No willy nilly sending people into the past that could bite them in the ass like in Blink.  They have a family who makes sure they feed, but makes sure their prey don't find a way to use said time travel to cause them headaches.  

The captive angel is the mother.  Don't forget she probably goes after River's arm because she had just gotten free from being tortured.  The angel that takes Rory is probably the father as it could resist the paradox poisoning, i.e. the strongest.  The rest of the non-babies were likely ""teenagers"" still learning to hunt.  The Angel of Liberty their equivalent of one of the juveniles speeding around in a sporty car with spoilers and spinners.

The last angel is seemingly spared by the Doctor and doesn't look to go after the Doctor or River.  Why?  Mutual ""let's end it here"".  The Doctor, despite his grief, recognized the Father halted after eliminating the two who killed off his children and gravely wounded mate.  They had both lost enough that day.  

TL;DR: These angels were a ma and pa raising and teaching their children how to hunt.  ",0,1398555343,null,0,1398555562,0,ch2wl0e,t3_241q6v,t1_ch2wl0e,t3_241q6v,null,1433535947,42,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,42

Also. as a side note, I do not feel this is a 'dive' a dive to me is when a player falls over like they have been shot when little or no contact has been made. A player who intentionally tries to make the goal keeper clip them, and then fall over from the proceeding challenge, can not be formally qualified as a dive if sufficient contact was there, It might not be fair play or good football. but its not a dive. If the player tried to mime contact from the goalkeeper to provoke a reaction from the referee I feel that would then be a dive.

We still have a monarchy, Church of England Bishops and hereditary peers in our unelected upper house of parliament and the house we do elect is done so using the most nominal form of democracy, first past the post. Britain needs to decentralise and modernise if this was likely I probably wouldn't have much interest in independence. As it is we have a political system that is gamed by 2 parties who are becoming closer and closer to each other, yet further and further from the people of this country causing increasing voter apathy. Part of this will be solved by independence, our parliament is elected by the additional member system, there will be no house of unelected aristocrats and its likely that the monarchy won't continue beyond the Queen.

As is mentioned in another thread London holds too much influence within the UK, this is great for London but prevents investment in other areas increasing the gap between London and the rest in a self perpetuating cycle. One advantage an independent Scottish state is that the capital, largest population base and economic powerhouse are 3 different cities which naturally acts as a counter to the kind of dominance that is hindering large parts of the UK. 

Scotland is much smaller than the UK and it will be much easier for the parliament to satisfy 5 million voters than 65 million. Hopefully this will enable us to tackle the problems facing our society and we won't have policies forced on us from Westminster that are not suited to the needs of Scotland. Also when it comes to self rule the Republic of Ireland seems to have fared much better going it alone than Northern Ireland has under British rule. 

I actually think we might well be slightly worse off in short term (next few years) as we rebalance the nation and steady the ship as an independent state, but in the long term having control of the country will pay dividends in terms of being able to make decisions in our own best interests.

That's absolutely not what I'm saying. Perhaps the thought is better put as ""it's the Westminster Parliamentary System I'm separating from"". 

I think you'd agree with me that there is much reform needed in our Parliament (e.g. dump the Lords Spiritual) but following the AV vote failure I have serious doubts as to whether any meaningful reform will occur within my lifetime. Alternatively if I vote ""yes"" in September I'll be voting in a genuine PR government from that point on. From a purely self-centred point of view Scottish Independence represents my best hope of ending the two-party ""to me, to you"" style of Westminster politics. Particularly when both sides seem to be more similar each year.

&gt; Following your logic you should be against Wales or Northern Irland or so, not London. 

Absolutely not. Scotland's relative success within the UK is largely in spite of Westminster and cannot possibly be used as an argument for the current system. Take Edinburgh, it has become a reasonable sized financial centre *without* any of the Canary Wharf style central government investment &amp; subsidies.

true,lokkenmor,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; being a gypsy is a life style[sic] choice

Okay, let's look at that. Would you concede that most of the gypsy population is born into that culture and raised within it - in the same vein that Jews are raised in a Jewish culture - and that it's deeply ingrained into their behavioural foundations from an early age?

On the assumption that you do agree, then isn't it fair to say that Gypsies are part of an ethnicity (which is define by Google as, ""the fact or state of belonging to a social group that has a common national or cultural tradition"") which has cultural and behavioural standards outside of the established norms of non-Gypsy folk?

If it's a culture that they're raised with and immersed in and that they don't see anything wrong with, then is it fair to call their participation in that culture a ""choice"" or is it more of a product of their upbringing?

I agree that you're probably not being ""racist"" because Gypsies aren't classically a race, they're an ethnicity, but undoubtedly you have a strong prejudice against Gypsies based on your personal experiences. I'm not saying you're wrong, or that your views aren't valid, but when you go around tarring a whole cultural tradition of people (good or bad) and writing them off en masse it does come off as ignorant and of only seeing your side of the argument.

Goes to the ""Self-fulfilling prophecy"" that was spoken of earlier. You marginalise Gypsies, they find it hard to survive by legitimate means, they turn to other (criminal) means to survive which harm you and people you identify with, you feel vindicated and marginalise them more, *ad infinatum*.

Oh and you're attacking a straw-man argument when you say that ""it's no more racist than me slagging off people who rollerblade[sic] or paint"" because there isn't a deeply ingrained culture, that a person is immersed in from birth, in roller-blading or painting.

The point is, you can't claim Edinburghs success as a reasonably sized financial centre is completely without subsidy from Westminster because it clearly is. 

To about the tune of £46bn or approximately a third of Scotlands GDP. 

&gt;you are making a whole lot of assumptions on what might have happened had we been independent over that period.

I think it isn't much of a leap to say it would have been disastrous for RBS. Scotland would have had to fork over approximately 35% of its GDP in bailouts to RBS.. And then on top of that Scotland isn't as large a country as the UK. The credit agencies probably wouldn't have put as much faith in a Scotland lead bailout as they did when the UK did it. 

A £46bn bailout looks bad from a ~£1,500bn economy. 

It looks much much worse from a ~£130bn economy.  

Either scenarios (Bailout, or let go bust) would have almost certainly been the death of Edinburgh as a reasonable sized financial centre.

Whereas there's definitely an anti-UKIP media sentiment, they aren't ""universally hated"": the Sun recently ran a UKIP press release as though it was investigative journalism and the Express has given Farage a weekly column.

The media attack UKIP whenever they provide them with new material, whether it's the UKIP annual conference or a TV ad campaign. This level of animosity is nothing unusual.

Nice ad hominem.

They're poorly educated for many reasons, one of them is a community issue but all leading gypsy and traveller individuals are trying and succeeding in changing that. To say all of them do this due to inherent criminality is laughable, it's because they move a lot, are often refused admissions and are very private people.

No, you shouldn't turn a blind eye to crime, but also please don't associate crime with the entire community.

Irish travellers are also a recognized ethnic minority.

The reason why what you are saying is racist is because your statements are grouping all individuals who come under the term ""gypsy"" as being ""pickpockets and thieves"". By using that term, you are insinuating that all 90,000 Roma currently resident in the UK are all criminals. 

The real figures of crime rates amongst these groups are actually lower than they are for ethnic British in relation to population numbers, so it's not even a valid claim (or in other words, you are far more likely to have your lead stolen by an ethnically British man that lives in a house).

&gt; I know you'd rather accuse me of racism than acknowledge my experiences.

I don't disagree that your experiences are as you claim, however these are the actions of individuals, not of the entire ethnic minority groups that the term ""gypsy"" covers.

Saying *""The gypsies that live near me are all thieves""* isn't racist (though it is bigotry) as you are singling out a specific group of individuals rather than the entire population, but that's not what you said.

No, that's not what I said. Broadly speaking, there are three clearly identified groups that come under the term ""gypsy""

Two of them are internationally recognised as being ethnic minorities (New Age Travellers are a very small percentage) Roma in particular are genetically unique as recorded in their DNA [(Their unique genetics played a significant role in the Nazi persecution of them)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porajmos).

You can be of Roma decent, live in a house, never travel anywhere. You'll still be of Roma ethnicity. Ethnicity goes much further than lifestyles choices or culture.

true,BraveSirRobin,null,null,"&gt;  is completely without subsidy from Westminster because it clearly is. 

RBS isn't a subsidy, in fact the UK government stands to make a profit on the sale. 

Much of the banking bailout in the EU was cross-border (see Spain) and besides that an independent Scotland's RBS may well have been given cash by rUK out of it's own self-interest if a) they hope for a long term profit on the share acquisition and b) to limit the knock-on effects to rUK economy. 

In fact I think cross-border bailouts have actually been made into a formal process recently, so in future this is pretty much certain. 

&gt;  Scotland would have had to fork over approximately 35% of its GDP in bailouts to RBS

I don't think you understand the root problem. The issue was via dodgy lending and investment practices bleeding over into putting people's current accounts at risk. Investments and loans aren't guaranteed and those involved know that and take the risk when they invest. However, if the two parts of the bank are linked then the investment side failing puts the government-guaranteed current and savings accounts at risk. People placing money on those accounts have legal safeguards on them. 

**If it had not been for the UK's deregulation in the 1980 this simply would not have been as much of a problem**. RBS wouldn't have been exposed to the crisis because they would still be limited to only providing current and savings accounts. A separate investment bank owned by the same people might have failed but it's damage would be only among those who chose to invest with them, no liability is placed on the high street brand. Allowing such banks to fail isn't a major risk to the wider economy. ",0,1398567066,null,0,false,0,ch30ws1,t3_241pwt,t1_ch30ws1,t1_ch2ya7m,null,1433537986,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

Darien was a **private investment** from Scotland's upper classes. They formed a private company similar to the East India Company in the hope of making big returns. It failed spectacularly.

At no point were the countries finances impacted because the venture had nothing to do with the Scottish Treasury. Unfortunately our leaders were all flat-broke and easy targets of English bribery to restore their personal positions. The whole thing was built on bribery, for example the reason Scot's Law remains separate was in order to gain the approval of the law lords who would have been made unemployed had their legal system cease to exist.

We'd be getting the opposite of a dictatorship, a Proportionally Representative government which would be less susceptible to external corruption from the banking lobby than a single-party/coalition parliamentary majority system. So yes, I do think such blaze deregulation would not have happened like it could under the inherently undemocratic Westminster majority system. The UK system is broken from the inside out, using party majorities to streamroll through legislation is not how democracy is supposed to work. Government policy votes are supposed to be on each proposal's own merits in the opinion of each publicly elected official, each voted in by their local community. Instead it's ""what the party whip says"", thus enabling such corruption/collusion between political parties and lobby groups. 

Also note that this issue was caused by the removal of long-standing existing regulation, not through the ""imposition"" of something new.

true,maybelying,null,null,"I'd argue that the show isn't about time travel, it's about a man who can time travel.  It seems like a pedantic difference, but I point it out because the stories in Doctor Who aren't generally about time travel, it is simply used as a mechanism to send the Doctor and his companions to a specific setting or environment for the story.

Steven Moffat doesn't use time travel as a plot device. Since his run began he constantly uses it as *the* plot.  As a result, he winds up with stories that aim to be overly clever but often wind up convoluted and riddled with inconsistencies.  When people post to this subreddit or /r/gallifrey for help understanding elements of a particular episode, there is a statistically high probability it will be one of his.

Many people like to pipe in, ""if you watch the episode carefully, everything is explained!"" but given the audience the show is aiming at, it is a bit of a fail to leave people scratching their heads.  

As for the inconsistency, it becomes frustrating when it becomes prevalent because it undermines any sense of drama or suspense.  When you handwave away things that have happened in previous episodes and then wrap up in the last 5 minutes with a solution that nobody could possibly have seen coming because you've suddenly just made it up out of nowhere, it becomes more and more difficult to become emotionally vested in the story.

Personally, I think his overuse of time as the plot has become a bit formulaic and cliched at this point, I hope he moves away from that direction in S8.  

The show is 50 years old and was never anticipated to last this long, I don't think anyone expects the writers to hold every new episode to that legacy of canon.  That's no excuse for lazy storytelling, however.  

Having said all that, there's certainly a lot of people that won't give a damn and just watch the episode for what it is.  There's nothing wrong with that, either.
