true,rubygeek,null,null,"&gt;  I, personally, believe that without capital goods and the pricing system you can not efficiently allocate scarce resources. 

Which I fully agree with. This is fully compatible with e.g. marxism / left communism / libertarian socialism / market communism / any number of other left wing ideologies that see private property rights to capital as a problem. 

Marx, for example, saw capitalism as essential to drive production efficiency to the level necessary in order to make redistribution viable, not as some definition of evil. The market mechanism was not his problem with capitalism. Not the allocation of production resources, but the allocation of profit and control, and constraints on labour that occurs because the working class faces substantial de-facto constraints of freedom because it is their only realistic option to meet basic needs.

&gt; Everyone values things differently and to try and force your values on others will likely lead to bad outcomes.

You will not get away without forcing some values, because some peoples values implicitly involves gross restrictions of the the freedoms of others. 

An example: In Norway (this is similar throughout the Nordic countries), we have something called ""allemannsrett"". Basically it is a ""freedom to roam"" that carves out broad exceptions to private land rights. It is an ancient right; throughout the Nordic countries this right pre-exists written law and has been so ingrained that in some cases it has been codified only recently (in Norway it was first put into statute in 1957) or have been considered integral to codified law respectively (in Sweden, it is part of the constitution).

In general, in Norway (and the rights are similar but not identical in the other Nordic countries), you can not legally exclude people from walking through a privately owned forest, for example. Nor can you limit peoples access to the shore line (generally there are strict limits on building within 100m of the shore, but where exceptions are granted, there is no ability to grant restrictions on access to the shore). You also can't restrict (at least non-commercial, not sure about commercial) picking of berries, mushrooms or flowers other than in the case of restrictions for environmental reasons. And camping is generally allowed, with some restrictions (e.g. you can't settle in for the long term).

This certainly means forcing values on property owners. Some property owners gets extremely agitated over this use and strongly dislike not being able to throw people off their land - especially along the coast in cases where building exceptions have been given, and people come to see certain beaches as ""theirs"" because of proximity to their house, only to have people come walking effectively across their garden and settle in for the day during summer because it is their legal and customary right to have access and use of the beach.

Not only does this means forcing values on some people to maximise the freedoms of others, but even applying potentially substantial coercion (if you try to threaten people to stay off your land, you could ultimately end up in prison; erecting fences can lead to substantial fines and you will be forced to tear them down) but is seen as essential to maximize freedom for others.

Yet the freedom this grants to the population as a whole has a transformative effect on society. Allemannsrett is taught at schools in Norway (don't know about the rest of the Nordic countries). It forms part of literature. The ability to go out in the wilderness without having to worry about whether or not you have a right to be somewhere is liberating. 

Many countries have similar restrictions to land rights to safeguard traditional use.

You can see the difference when you travel to areas with less tradition for this. E.g. when I moved from Norway to the UK, one of the things I found shocking was how much land was fenced off and inaccessible. I'd never seen a park with opening hours before, for example, as though you could legally do that in Norway in built up areas, and some parks have partial fencing, the idea of locking up a park seems ludicrous. I still find a lot of the fencing off in the UK quite offensive and disgusting (though the UK has actually greatly *expanded* the previously very limited right to roam, with legal changes in England and Wales in 2000, and for Scotland in 2003)

You don't want to help him because he doesn't do the things you do, he doesn't pay into the system like you do, he doesn't take on your burdens. Why should you help him if he won't help you? Because that's not what caring is, a key point of the article is that unlike many systems around the world the NHS isn't a blackmailer, it doesn't hold your health at ransom, it doesn't set rules you have to live by or it will withhold treatment. It just cares for who it can, when it can and to the best of its ability.

You are right, if the entire country just stopped paying tax we wouldn't be able to have an NHS.. but that's not a realistic scenario it's a fantasy. It's like you can't justify coldly kicking them out of hospital beds using *real world* reasons so you take to outlandish hypothetical scenario's.

So his accounts with the NHS weren't on balance with yours, that's a shame and sure it *would* be nice if it wasn't the case. It's a little too late now though, he lived his life, he made his choices.. so we can either help him or we can stand there and watch another human suffer because we are too cheap to forgive his missed tax returns.

There will always be people to play the system, who skip it, who cheat it... that's the price you pay for having a system. Very rarely is it large enough to be a proper detriment on the system though. Most people are basically good, most people do indeed step up and share in the responsibilities. To expect 100% compliance, or to punish when perfection isn't met is lunacy.

You pay at most £3000 per year for the NHS (£90bn budget between [30m tax payers](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/277433/Table_2.1.pdf), but it's less than that because obviously business pay a huge chunk of the tax revenue), that money made the end of this mans life a little easier for him and his family. You didn't know him, he never paid any of your bills and you won't get that money back.. but one day in the distant future someone will do it for you. Seems like a good deal to me.

So I'm another American and uh.. I do love Chelsea (now especially more that Mourinho's back!). To be honest I didn't read all of the post because, honestly, I just assumed it was someone from another country and, honestly, I was just sorta going by the highlights. 

Until I saw the part about the fan being from the US.

Uhm... so... I'm not sure if there's other Americans in this particular thread, but we're not all like this. I love Chelsea like no other (altho I'm a Portlander... and well, yeah), but the reality is I like the game more. I love watching football from all over the world and I don't care what match is on, I just like watching folks kick a ball around (altho you fucking United people... *angry fist*). Sadly, I do somewhat understand the mindset of the poster, so let me try to translate it out of his language and into something more resembling proper English:

""I like Chelsea, I really do. But they aren't winning enough. They need to win for me to keep loving them.""

And that's basically it. No offense to the OP of course, but it's how America views supporting team sports. Don't like how the team you're supporting is doing? Ok, switch loyalties and all's good. Here in the US, we don't generally have the same kinds of fandoms for football that y'all have... well.. everywhere else in the world.

I'll say it too. I think Chelsea's form HAS suffered a bit, but I refuse to give em up. They are my team through the good times and the bad. They could fall all the way down into League 2 and I would still fly the Blue flag proudly. They are my team. Period. Full stop.

So I do understand some of you guy's opinions. However, please do consider the source and give him a little bit of leeway.

From [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litre#Rough_conversions)

&gt;A litre of water has a mass almost exactly equal to one kilogram of water. An early definition of the kilogram was set as the mass of one litre of water. Because volume changes with temperature and pressure, and pressure uses units of mass, the definition of a kilogram was changed. At standard pressure, one litre of water has a mass of 0.999975 kg at 4 °C, and 0.997 kg at 25 °C.

Also, seawater is significantly denser than fresh water, so a cubic metre of seawater is [approximately 1030 Kg](http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2002/EdwardLaValley.shtml).

true,_The_Editor_,eng-devon,Devon,"Quite a lot of scales were originally based on/around water, it's a very common substance and easy to visualise amounts.. 

As far as I'm aware, the gram, calorie, and degree centigrade (later becoming Celsius) were all arbitrary definitions based on the properties of water..

The problem is that the properties of water will change as the temperature/pressure are varied... So 1 calorie measured at sea level at the equator isn't going to be the same calorie as that measured in Lima...

Now all three of these units have been re-defined in SI terms:

* Celsius used to be defined by the freezing point (0°C) and boiling point (100°C) of water, but is now defined by two points on the Kelvin scale for absolute temperature: Absolute zero 0K = -273.15°C, and the triple point of water 273.16K = 0.01°C. This avoids any influence of atmospheric pressure on the freezing/boiling temps.
* 1 gram used to be defined as the ""weight of a volume of pure water equal to the cube of one one-hundreth of a meter, at the temperature of melting ice (then later 4°C)"", but is now defined as one on-thousandth of a kilogram, which itself is defined by the mass of a ""physical prototype kilogram"" which is held safely by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures.
* Defining calorie was harder, since it dealt with a temperature change in the water. When converted to Joules, the value would change between 4.182-4.204 J depend on what temperature you started at.. There's now a few calories defined, all can be seen listed [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie#Precise_definitions) But broadly speaking they've no been given Joule values, but retain their definition regarding raising the temperature of water.

Pretty much all definitions of weights and measures have moved away from an experimental result, and instead are being based on fundamental physical constants..

If you don't understand this, you don't understand the topic. If Scotland continues to use the pound without a currency union, it loses control of the bank of England, and will have no similar institution to replace it. The country can no longer control its own monetary policy or do anything to aid the economy in case of emergency. It can no longer collect seigniorage, which is a profit gained because the cost to produce money is usually less than its value.  

Such useage is usually a last resort, or for third world countries, and creates a dependency on a foreign nation. 

So **you** might not want or expect a currency union, but Salmond did. That is what is being discussed. If you don't understand this then you don't know what you're voting for. I don't actually mind if Scotland wants independence, I just think a lot of people are totally misinformed about what that will actually mean.

What lifestyle do you imagine these guys live? They're not professional footballers, they are funded with enough money to be able to train full time and to pay for one, maybe two coaches (depending on the sport). Once their career is over they won't have money to support themselves and will have to get a traditional job. If they were to live 'extravagant' lives of partying and drinking, their funding would immediately be cut I imagine.

To answer your overall question, we should fund Olympic hopefuls because it increases country morale (were you in the country during London 2012??), it inspires both kids and adults to live a more active lifestyle, inspires people to take up sports they may not necessarily be that interested in, or that may be cheaper to participate in (such as running/athletics) than rugby, football or cricket.

&gt; To me, the only thing this changes is the amount of seats at a game.

You're looking at it too simplistically here - it's about more than just extra seats. If they're putting a ton more executive boxes in the new Main Stand then that's going to have a pretty big impact because they can bring in a huge amount of revenue for the space they take. Likewise if there's a ton more retail floorspace outside the ground then that'll pull in a good chunk of extra income on top of the increased capacity. A small shopping centre, a hotel, all these things allow the club to draw in much more money than they ever could from just ticket sales. 

It's going to cost a lot of money that we're not going to see back for at least 5-10 years, but that doesn't mean it's a bad idea. It's a hit you've got to take at some point - if you focus only on the short term all the time then you just end up massively falling behind in the long term.

I also don't think the money going in will impact our transfer spending potential over the next few years, because it's probably paid for with outside investment. Getting £100m to spend on players from outside investment is hard because there's very little guarantee those players will generate a return on the investment, but I'd say that the Anfield redevelopment is pretty much guaranteed to pay itself back and then some, even if takes a decade or so to do it.

If he gets us in the top 4 he absolutely deserves a real shot. I read in one of those CFC articles that they reckon we've got a 10%~15% chance of getting in the top 4 as it stands. If Sherwood pulls that off despite only taking control halfway then I think he should get a chance at a full season.

So if you want to make a last minute detour to somewhere else, or to spend an extra hour in bed and get a later train, it's great. The price isn't actually *that* high, but you can defintiely get cheaper tickets if you book in advance and don'tm ind sacrificing that flexibility.

The cheapest tickets you'll find are 'Advance' tickets. These are one-way tickets. They are valid only on the train and date you bought them for, and they aren't refundable.

 These can be significantly cheaper than normal tickets, especially if you book early. You can book these up to three months in advance. The obvious downside to these is that they're completely inflexible. You have to take the train you're booked on - if you miss the train, you're going to have to buy another ticket. 

You can indeed get cheaper tickets if you don't travel during peak times. You can get 'Off-peak' tickets and 'Super Off-peak' tickets. These tickets obviously require you to travel at off-peak times. 'Super' tickets are more restrictive, but cheaper. 

Unfortunately, there aren't national 'peak' times - these will vary according to the train company and where you're travelling to and from. But the time's you've assumed are a good rough estimate.

So I think, at least from that standpoint (saving the NHS money), modifying cells for *health* reasons, rather than superficial **should** be legal.

Well, historically, and particularly in Europe and the developing world, libertarianism only meant anarchism, and so it was clearly anti-hierarchy and left wing.  More recently, in the US, a new breed of 'libertarianism' has arisen, which the left has generally disparaged as 'pot-smoking republicans' - i.e. strong support for the exploitative hierarchies of capitalism, but egalitarian on social issues.

&gt;There's tyranny and there's freedom - right and left are just a question of what you choose to do with either when you get it 

As I say, historically speaking, to be on the left meant to oppose hierarchy and to be on the right meant to support it.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"My Grandparents and my Mother are from Southampton, I studied at the University of Portsmouth, and I worked for a (placement) year in Swanwick, which is about half way between the two, so I can comment a bit on the city &amp; the area.

Firs off, the South coast of the UK generally gets the best weather in the country - Longer hours of sunlight, less rain etc and the temperatures tend to be higher than most other places in the country as well. Southampton currently holds the record for the highest temperature in the UK at 35.6 degrees Celsius - 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit.

Southampton as a city, is large and spread out over a wide area. It does have a lot of students, but it also has a lot of other residents. 

The fact that the city is so spread out means it is lacking a clearly defined ""city centre"" but this shouldn't really be looked upon as a downside.

History-wise, Southampton has been a major port since 1066 when it became the major artery between London and Normandy when the Normans invaded. Since then, the port has changed into one of the largest commercial ports on the South Coast, and it is one of the major locations for container ships entering the UK.

The port is also associated with cruise liners, and is the main location for cruises leaving the UK. The Titanic is one of the famous ships to depart from the port of Southampton on her final journey, as did the Mayflower when she departed the UK on her famous journey to the USA.

Southampton was also a major shipyard, with Thornycroft building ships there between 1904 and 2004.

Southampton is also the home city of RJ Mitchell, who designed the Supermarine Spitfire, originally as a Schneider Trophy competition aircraft, but the onset of WWII made it a valuable defensive tool for the UK.

Because of the strategic importance of the docks, Southampton was bombed very heavily during the war, and it was high on the list of locations that Hitler would have had to capture quickly had he invaded the UK.

After the war, many houses in the bombed areas were levelled to make way for bigger houses the be built as part of the modernisation of the city. As a result much of the housing in Southampton dates from after the war, which gives Southampton a remarkably unified feeling in terms of housing design, compared to other cities where housing has been built as necessary without replacing much of the older housing stock.

Southampton is also right on the edge of the New Forest, which is a
Royal forest playing host to many local animals, including a lot of ponies, which have spread from the established right of commoners to graze horses and cattle (and depending on rights and time of year) sheep and pigs in the forest. The ponies spread because they were allowed to be left out all year, and they weren't sold for beef like the cattle.

Southampton is also the location of the only geothermal power station in the UK which provides electricity to the port, and also provides hot water for the central district of the city which many businesses, and the West Quay shopping centre, use for heat. As a result Southampton is ranked as one of the lowest carbon emitting cities in the UK according to British Gas in 2006.

Manufacturing-wise Southampton is traditionally know, apart form the docks, is known for tobacco production, being home to a British American Tobacco factory for many years, grain milling, and more recently, aircraft and car manufacture, cables, electrical engineering products, and petrochemical production.

Garcia deserves to start after his awesome performance yesterday, but he would have started even if he played an average game because he's the only one fit. 

Lescott looked better than anyone else partnering Kompany, he gets my vote. Nasty is too nervous and Demichelis is going to be a liability against the pace of Pedro and Alexis.

I think Jovetic + Negredo is the best forward partnership because Jovetic is imbetween a striker and midfielder, plus his movement is more likely to cause problems  for their defence  than Edin, even though he also played well yesterday.


Having said all that, I really want Milner to start, but I don't expect him to. Maybe he'll come off the bench if we are doing well to solidify our position.

If Aspas could find a way to give a similar impression, imo he'd get more opportunity in the starting eleven.

Now the argument that Aspas is more of a striker than a #10 may work against my argument above, but think to the beginning of the season when Suarez was suspended. Aspas was playing as a #10, as a winger, but never really as the #9. He showed he's got quite a bit of positional awareness in offense and also that he can spot a quality pass. Now I ask you to look at how often Suarez, Sterling and even Sturridge go back to support the defense even when they are ostensibly our main attackers. While Aspas attempted the same, I don't really recall it being to the same level as SAS and Sterling.

Imho Rodgers decided Aspas needs to learn more before he can play for Liverpool on a regular basis.

My suggestion for the rest of your day in Edinburgh, if you have spare time, is just to wander around the town and if you see anything that takes your fancy, have a look! This should be a good cure for your jetlag, especially if you make sure you stay out a bit beyond sunset. I think this should help tell your body what time it is now. Also, if you want, have a look for a quiet pub and maybe enjoy a local beer or two!

Monday: I've been to the Viking museum a few years ago and I can highly recommend it. They have an interactive ride-through display there, where you can experience the sights, sounds, and smells of Viking life. I really enjoyed it when i went through.

I can also *really really* highly recommend the National Railway Museum. It has some excellent historical engines there, right from the beginning of Steam up until and including the last Steam Engine ever manufactured for the UK railways. There are also some great examples of electric and diesel traction for the UK, and some examples of locomotives that we exported around the world, to places like South Africa, Argentina, etc.

Picking up on your interest in the nuclear bunker, you could fine one later on in your trip - there's one at Kelvedon Hatch in Essex, just outside London, that was supposed to be home to whatever was left of the UK government in case of nuclear war. It might only be accessible by car, though, but you might be able to slot it in to the weekend in London.

Tuesday/Wednesday: Neither Bristol or Bath sounds very doable on one day on the trains - to get to Bristol you have to go via Manchester and Birmingham and it takes at least 6 hours. To get to Bath, you have to go via Bristol, so it takes even longer.

Depending on what you want to see, I would personally recommend getting a fast service to London and then other services out of the city to other towns - this might work for Bath if you're prepared to do it but I would personally recommend a trip out to Colchester if you're interested in seeing Roman archaeology, or down to the south coast for Portsmouth to see the Historic Dockyard for a museum of the Royal Navy, hosting HMS Victory and the Mary Rose. Colchester can be reached from York in about 4 hours, and Portsmouth can be reached in about 4:45 or 5 hours.

In fact, if you do the south coast thing, there are other museums in the area, and there is the National Oceanographic centre in Southampton, or you could go along to Brighton for a trip to the seaside!

London days: I can recommend the Tower as a great tour - I can also recommend that you try and get a tour with [this guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Callaghan_%28Beefeater%29) - he's a great tour guide and really funny!

Otherwise, just go to as many museums as you can - there are loads of free ones so you should be good to go on that front. Just bear in mind that the more famous ones are quite large, and if you don't go in with a reasonable number of things you specifically want to see then you could spend days in each of them!

Train-wise, the official site for train travel is [national rail](http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/). The site can give you information on routes, engineering works, etc.

&gt;He engages in politics whilst arguing politics doesn't work

No, he engages in politics while explaining the currest system of politics is not working and things need to change. He works with Caroline Lucas MP (Green Party) while admitting he would not vote for her because in the current system that vote is redundant.

&gt;He's against voting, but for signing petitions (=voting)

He isnt against voting. He's against voting within the current system. He's using the petition to prove a point. That within the current system, the majority can all want one thing, and vote for it (Via petition) but the 'elected' few who make the actual decisions will make decisions that do not reflect the will of the people.

&gt;As Slavoj Žižek has said, the instictive response is to demand action: ""We need to ACT now!"". However, the correct response should always first be: ""We need to THINK now!"". Why are things not working and how would they work better. It's easy to agigate for change and incite a (typically violent) revolution, but when the dust settles, every injustice remains unsolved.

From listening to his arguments, I think Brand would agree. 

Everyone who interviews him questions him, 'so what are your answers'. He has never offered the answers. He has never claimed too. You're missing the point if you think he's demanding that. He, like the Occupy Movement, is not saying 'Lets do this now!'. He's saying 'Look, lets acknowledge, NOW, something is wrong. We need to change how we do things. We need to think together and work towards a solution. *Why* are things not working? *How* should they work better. Thats what he is preaching. 

But every interviewer follows the same route, egging him on and expecting him to describe to them the perfect system of government. He knows he doesnt have the perfect system of government. He just wants the rest of us to realise, perhaps we CAN work towards that perfect system, or as close to perfect as we can get.

Means we are asking more from Lennon than he is really capable of doing.  

Lennon is a player who disrupts defenses but isn't necessarily a threat, how we have been playing really calls for a more rounded player on the wing who can provide service but still a threat on goal (one of the reasons i think if we could get him healthy and on the pitch Lamela would be the better choice).

true,Bytgq,null,null,"&gt; The predictions of the results of the above have been wrong, always. Which means the computer models must be consistently wrong.

I really don't think that's true.  The problem is that science (the *whole* of science, not just climate science) is full of uncertainty, and scientists are trained to understand uncertainty and take it into account.  So a scientist might say ""we are 95% sure that the amount of warming by year x will be between y and z"", or ""this drug works no better than placebo with p&lt;0.01"" or ""there would only be a 0.00001% chance of seeing these results if the Higgs boson did not exist"".  The mainstream media, and the general public, can't process those ideas - they end up being reduced to ""scientists aren't sure whether global warming is happening"" or ""scientists were wrong about drug"" or ""scientists have found the Higgs boson"".  It's very easy to pretend that climatologists made more precise predictions than they really did, and cry foul when they don't exactly pan out.  I remember reading an article complaining that an earlier IPCC report had stated that the rate of warming is approximately 0.14 (I can't remember the units), while a newer one gave a value of 0.13 - it was argued that this meant they were ""admitting"" that they had exaggerated global warming, while in reality they just had more information and were able to make a slightly better approximation now.

&gt; Whenever something that doesn't follow the computer models happens, then it is 'weather', but whenever something that does follow the models happens, it's 'climate change'

Imagine I rolled a die 6000 times.  I could very confidently predict that I would see approximately 1000 sixes.  However, I couldn't make any prediction about what the result of the first roll, or the second roll, or the 5000th roll, would be.  That's the distinction between climate and weather.  There is a lot of random variation in the weather, but if you look at it over many years, clear patterns emerge.

Unfortunately people do have a tendency to look at extreme weather events and say ""look, a bad storm - it's proof of global warming!"" or ""look, record low temperatures - how can anyone believe in global warming now?"".  The reality is that whatever happens to the climate, extreme weather events of all kinds will continue to be observed.  Of course, over a very long period of time, on a global scale, we would expect to see extreme hot weather (and things associated with warmer weather, like storms) more often, and extreme cold weather less often, as the earth warms.

&gt; Science is proving the hypotheses

Not really.  A very influential view (due to Karl Popper) is that science is about *disproving* hypotheses.  Even the oldest and most well-tested theories eventually turn out to require caveats or adjustments.

Learn to make useful pages in PHP or another popular server-side language -- look around at job ads in your area to see what's popular out of Ruby, Python, PHP, .NET. Once you've made a few things start applying for jobs and see what happens. If you feel like you're not getting anywhere, find a local company you like and ask if you can do some work experience (a month is a solid amount) then apply again.

CS50x is fine but it's more theoretical than what you really need. A Master's is just overkill.

Midfield: Yaya, Javi Garcia, Nasri, Silva. I'm still unsure if Nasri is fit enough for a full 90 minutes so it wouldn't surprise me if Navas started with Silva and Nasri coming on in the second half.

The only way I can reconcile the ""The rules are one thing, practice another"" with ""the military is subordinate to government"" is that the general is contemplating the case where the government will deliberately decide to break Spanish law, and in context, this also presumably involves using military force in order to maintain the unity of the Spanish state. 

And I don't know about you, but that gives me the heebie jeebies just as much as if the General was contemplating doing this on his own.

* [""I respect all the decisions taken by the British, but I know for sure that a region that would separate from a member state of the European Union would remain outside the European Union and that should be known by the Scots and the rest of the European citizens"".
However, Mr Rajoy did not say he would seek to block an independent Scotland's subsequent entry to the EU.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-25132026)

* [Rajoy would not commit himself on whether he would use Spain's veto, as an EU member country, to prevent it from rejoining. In the case of Scotland voting for independence ""we would be in a different story. Let's not get ahead of ourselves,"" he said. Covering his bases in case of a yes vote, Rajoy was also keen to argue that Scots and Catalans do not have a shared history or trajectory.

* [Mr Garcia-Margallo said: ""If in the UK both parties agree that this is consistent with their constitutional order, written or unwritten, Spain would have nothing to say, just that this does not affect us. ""No one would object to a consented independence of Scotland."" He said the independence of Kosovo was different because it was based on a ""unilateral decision"" and admitted the Spanish position would have been different if it had been agreed between Belgrade and Pristina.](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/304495/Spain-will-not-veto-an-independent-Scotland-joining-EU)

* [While he refused to comment directly on whether Spain might veto Scottish accession to the EU after an independence vote, he insisted the cases of Scotland and Catalonia were “fundamentally different”. Madrid would continue to resist a Catalan plan to hold its own referendum on independence less than two months after the Scottish vote in September, he said.](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/977a39ea-8c26-11e3-9b1d-00144feab7de.html)

At one time I suppose the gender player a role but has long since been abandoned


Here is the technical answer:

In many other languages, nouns are assigned to gender largely without any semantic basis – that is, not based on any feature (such as animacy or sex) of the person or thing that a noun represents. However in many languages there may be a correlation, to a greater or lesser degree, between gender and the form of a noun (such as the letter or syllable with which it ends).

...

In some languages, any gender markers have been so eroded over time (possibly through deflexion) that they are no longer recognizable. Many German nouns, for example, do not indicate their gender through either meaning or form. In such cases a noun's gender must simply be memorized, and gender can be regarded as an integral part of each noun when considered as an entry in the speaker's lexicon. (This is reflected in dictionaries, which typically indicate the gender of noun headwords where applicable.)

Second-language learners are often encouraged to memorize a modifier, usually a definite article, in conjunction with each noun – for example, a learner of French may learn the word for ""chair"" as la chaise (meaning ""the chair""); this carries the information that the noun is chaise, and that it is feminine (because la is the feminine singular form of the definite article).",0,1392567779,null,0,false,0,cfgqira,t3_1y1lnf,t1_cfgqira,t3_1y1lnf,null,1432421851,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Yet here we have the head of the EU effectively telling him directly that it isn't as simple as he has made out. Both his timescale and policy visions don't tally with reality.

Most important of all, in saying this Barraso has effectively re-affirmed the EUs belief that *IF* Scotland vote to leave the UK, then because the UK is the signatory member of the EU, they will by extension ALSO be leaving the EU. Furthermore, in order to rejoin the EU they would have to undergo the same accession process as every other nation - regardless of their previous status within the organization. It will mean all their legislation and economic apparatus will have to undergo re validation for membership and the same waiting periods and veto process will apply - requiring the consent of all other members. He isn't saying Scotland can't achieve that - but he is rightly pointing out that it is going to be much more complicated than the SNP have portrayed.

As much as Salmond seems intent on turning this into an ""Eton led Westminster bullying poor little Scotland"" I hope voters in Scotland will rightly interpret it as yet another example of Salmond mouthing off about something that he actually has very little control over.

Personally I'd rather be told what to do by a politician in Westminster than preached at by Salmond.",0,1392569249,null,0,false,0,cfgr1xm,t3_1y1yyc,t1_cfgr1xm,t1_cfgn1vb,null,1432422102,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

It's going to take decades or campaigning, lobbying, and the gradual ushering in a a new generation with different values.  It takes seemingly forever for some things to change.  Look how long it took to end slavery in the US, despite campaigning for decades.  Look how long they've been trying to bring in universal healthcare. 
 
The democratic process is excrutiatingly slow, and that's a very good thing because it prevents mass changes and the quick rise of dictators, like has happened in other less cautious democratic systems.  The checks and balances are there for a reason.  Every generation only really has one big paradigm shift in law.  It takes a long time.  Having good arguments and strong lobbyists isn't enough, you need to do it for decades sometimes.  The only other way is revolution.  And that comes with its own cons that can be a load worse.
 
I'm talking in real terms here.  I mean even if everybody in westminster wanted drugs legalised it'd still likely take years to happen.  But the fact that most either don't or don't admit it for fear of angering constituents and losing their career, means it'll be a long time likely.  The US legalising marijuana may speed up the process somewhat if it seems to benefit them a lot in terms of tax revenue and the economy and so on.  
 
You've also got to factor in that the government isn't there to do the most logical sensible things.  It's there to respond to the public's whims.  These tend to be rather reactive.  Unless there was an overwhelming majority to change the law then it's probably not going to happen even if it makes perfect sense for many reasons.

Other players would have reacted very differently, but the lad has just got on with his job. On the bench this week? Fair enough gaffer, if you put me on I will do a job... Not even on the bench? Oh that's a shame, I need to work harder in training and not go bitching on Twitter like others would.

He reminds me a lot of Solskjaer at United. Not technically gifted, but reads the game well, puts in a shift and is a great professional to boot. Because of those attributes (and a certain goal that he scored), Ole became one of the cult heroes of that generation of United players, and I could see Naismith doing that for us.

I currently live in one of the pilot zones, and life is quieter and feels safer now that most people obey the 20mph limit.

Before the limit walking to the shops often felt like playing frogger, and cycling in the immediate area was often semi-suicidal.

Now the limit is appropriate to the roads (narrow often not wide enough for cars to pass each other, with pedestrians and children, blind corners and junctions)

I feel that some roads could probably have remained 30mph zones (Hotwells Road, Anchor Rd, Coronation Road and similar) as they are major thoroughfares, with little pedestrian traffic across them (and that served fairly well by controlled crossings).

On balance however as a driver and as a pedestrian and (very) occasional cyclist I like the new 20mph limits.

true,gyroda,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"Assuming you want a skilled developer, which you do if you're dealing with both iOS *and* android *and* a central server then that's someone who could be earning £30k a year, easily, should they go into industry.

This person has to then pay out for a Mac if they don't have one (needed for iOS development) or a license for something like [marmalade](https://www.madewithmarmalade.com). They have to pay out for some kind of server (might be able to do something with Google's platform or something similar for free under a certain limit of use). They will also need an iOS device and an Android device on which to test these apps.

That's easily a few hundred spent already, but lets assume you only develop for android, have a phone already and can use Google App Engine and Google Compute Engine, making the starting costs negligible. The developer then has to spend hundreds of hours (yes, hundreds if you want it all done in-house) developing and testing this if you want to make sure it works. This could be reduced by using an external service (maybe you could integrate surveymonkey or something into it), but this is still a massive undertaking. The developer could be doing something like this for real cash.

If you make it ad-supported then you could split the revenue with the developer, sure, but what way would you want to split it. Unless you pay for some kind of hosting and use the ad revenue to cover that cost I'd say the developer deserves close to 100%, if not 100%. They'd have spent tonnes of time, effort and possibly money on such an endeavour and you'd have to ask what you've brought to the partnership to be deserving on part of the revenue.

Unless you're going to start marketing this app or something I don't see how you'd be working *with* anyone. You've given an idea for [surveymonkey on phones](https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/mobile-surveys/), I fail to see what you're doing beyond that.

**Take Aways**

- IMO, Agger looked poor. He was pushed off the ball all day. On Podolski's goal he over-committed up the pitch and was caught out of position, leaving Skrtel to face a 2 on 1.

- Sterling played really well, regardless of where he was playing

- Suarez and Sturridge had chances, albeit mostly low-percentage ones

- Coutinho was overzealous in the first half and pretty invisible in the second half.

Towsend is unlucky not to have more assists IMO as the likes of Paulinho and Eriksen have missed absolute sitters he presented to them. Also Eriksen only had 1 assist under AVB so I dont think that we will see a fair reflection on Townsends productivity until he gets a good run under Sherwood. Townsend also pulls players out of position with his dribbles - like Lennon used to do

&gt; I don't think he has created a single chance

He creates 1.923 chances per 90 mins. Well done.

* Hendo is so vital to this squad. We missed his pressing, energy and passing so much today.

* The league is still wide open, lets get pumped for Swansea!!

Particularly since the Lambert era began, however, there's been a focus on investing in youth, most likely due to the fact Lerner's tightening his belt, and it's a philosophy that works for Lambert.

Nowadays the key to determining what a good Chairman is depends on two things; managerial decision-making and funding. Giving McLeish a chance was a woeful decision, But getting Lambert in was - and for me still remains - a good call. The funding's dried up a tad, but the way Lambert's adapted to organise the team works a bit to cancel this problem out.

For me, so long as there's a stable manager in charge, which we have, and a steady stream of funding, which is waivering slightly now but not to an awful extent, there's no substantial reason not to support Lerner.

* Crap wasn't the word used.

Now, whether or not this is true, and to what extent, is left up to debate.  What exactly does he mean by this?  If what he means is management wanted him on the set at 8am, rather than stumbling in drunk at 3pm...then he's the one who is unreasonable.  However, if what he means is management wanted him on set at 8am, but THEY didn't show up until 3pm, drunk out of their skulls and ordering everything done so far that day be scrapped because they weren't there, then they are the ones who are being unreasonable.

Bottom line, whatever the reason, he felt he was being treated poorly.  He looked around and saw how everyone else was being treated, from the co-stars to the janitors, and felt they were being treated poorly as well, so he decided he wasn't going to put up with that.  I respect him for that decision.  While I don't have intimate internal knowledge of the situation, I don't get the sense that Chris is/was a diva or sorts.

Scotland is a net exporter whilst England isa net importer so it's no skin off Scottish noses but rUK not being able to benefit from Scottish exports via an independent Scotland being part of a Sterling zone could substantially jack up the interest rates the rUK pays on the open market which impacts on everything from mortgage rates to employment rates.

The Scottish economy is in pretty good health and has been propping up the UK economy (as has the London-area to be fair) for the past thirty-five years or so. If it hadn't been for North Sea oil the Thatcher government would never have been able to afford the tax cuts it did which disproportionately benefited the SE of England.

But English (and Scottish) voters were lied to for so long about the state of the Scottish economy, starting with the burying of the McCrone report, with the claim that England was propping up and paying for Scotland that most English voters are operating under the mistaken belief that an independent Scotland would leave England better off financially. 

The reality is that an independent Scotland not using Sterling would screw the rUK - so George Osborne, Ed Balls and Danny Alexander are very much threatening to cut off their noses to spite their faces. That's why Alec Salmond et al think that the Coalition are bluffing - they genuinely don't realise that the likes of Osborne would deliberately fuck over the English economy just to get back at Scots for choosing not to be governed by Westminster.

Kenny MacAskill went to a football match and got a bit too drunk, and was arrested (though not charged) for being drunk and disorderly. How is that anti-English? was he arrested for breach of the peace or abusive behaviour? was he being a knob to people because they are English or was he -like so many others- just a bit too drunk. are all Scottish people that get drunk in England now assumed to be anti-English?

I can't find a source on Neil's comment but since when the acts of union came about there was rioting in England *and* Scotland then surely you can see where such an analogy would come from

and to finish, they are constantly called on being Anti-English but funny enough there never seems to be any substance to the claims, not wanting to be in direct political union with a country doesn't equate to hating that country or it's people, I wouldn't want to share a parliament with R.O.I, it doesn't mean I hate the Irish.

I spent a few months learning while working part time -- I was putting quite a lot of effort in but still probably only between 3-4 days a week, it definitely wasn't like I wasn't leaving the house. That was enough to get me a month of paid internship and springboard me into a full time job.

A lot of people who've studied formally overestimate what you really need to know, especially for an entry level web development position, and try to put people off. Probably they want to protect the value of their degrees... I'd say, just learn the technical skills that are useful for getting a job then fill yourself in on the theoretical concepts when you can.

If you're worried about having time to study I'd suggest signing on -- lots of places still have pretty reasonable advisers, and if you tell them you're studying programming they might well let you get away with just doing the minimum possible to claim JSA etc. for a few months.

To be honest I think you're getting a fair bit of bad advice in this thread. Things like TEFL and service work are going to get you nowhere in the long term -- if they give you the time to study then OK they can keep you going for a bit, but often you'll end up exhausted and ground down still at square one. If you're interested in coding tilt yourself at that because it's one of the only sectors that's growing and will continue to in the near future. I'd forget about graphic design for the time being -- much much harder to get into, plus it's something you can get yourself involved in later on from a web development/app programming position.

true,TheMysteriousShadow,lfc68,,"Quick dissection of our performance:

- Had we gotten the first goal within our (once again) fantastic opening five minutes, Arsenal would have been crushed and we would have won the game easily: they looked tired, sluggish and nervous on the ball until their first goal gained them significant confidence. 

- Oxlade-Chamberlain, not for the first time this season, proved their main inspiration, linking the play exceedingly well and making runs that really undid our structure at the back. What was painstakingly obvious was that we need a player of this calibre on the opposite side to Sterling, who can only service one of the flanks at a time, as then we'd be unstoppable flowing forward.

- Their first goal was something that no team can really defend against: loads of unlucky bounces, players slightly out of position in the confusion, and a brilliant finish all just put it away without time to react.

- We showed tremendous heart, but missing Henderson in the middle of the park was also obvious: Ozil, Flamini and Chamberlain all had excessive amounts of space on the ball going forward, since we lacked a player with a big enough engine to fill that hole. 

- That's taking nothing away from Allen, though, who I felt had the performance of his season; he was lively, showed great passing ability and wasn't afraid of running at defenders. So good was his first touch and control that I occasionally mistook him for Suarez or Coutinho. 

- Sterling was, once again, majestic. Easily our best player today. 

- Should have been a second penalty, but that would have required Webb to give two decisions in our favour in succession and that's completely unheard of.

*In the end, Arsenal were just luckier than we were in front of goal; they didn't hammer us as we did them, and there's a case to say that they didn't even deserve the win, but what we should take away from that performance is our energy and their nervousness -- we had scared them into that state, and for them to simply defend for the last 15 minutes as we bombarded them with attacks is testament to our title chances this season.*",0,1392577193,null,0,false,0,cfgu96p,t3_1y2m9h,t1_cfgu96p,t3_1y2m9h,null,1432423678,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

However the SNP are completely delusional.  They seem to think that if Scotland becomes independent, then the whole world will rally behind the Scottish cause.

For example, the SNP seem utterly convinced that the UK will agree to letting them share the pound, even though we have completely ruled it out.  For decades the UK has maintained a very firm position that currency unions without fiscal unions are a recipe for disaster - why would we ever let our own currency get dragged down by letting a smaller country use it (there may come a point where the Scottish may equal or surpass the UK economy, but the Scottish market will be in utter turmoil for at least a decade whilst it sets up its infrastructure)?

And now this: first off I think Barroso, having been the president for a decade, knows a bit more about how the EU works than some tiny self-interested political party in Northern Europe - so the idea that the SNP would completely dismiss his advice is just foolish.  The Spanish prime minister was the first person to bring up that Scotland would need to reapply to become an EU member.  Even if Scotland does manage to gain independence, this doesn't change the Spanish interest in making an example out of Scotland as to why breaking away from another country will be bad for the break-away state - the UK has been fairly nice regarding the Scottish situation, Spain isn't currently so nice with the Catalan situation...

All the SNP has succeeded in doing so far is establishing that they have they share the same pompous, self-righteous, arrogant attitude of your average English politician...  Hell, I wouldn't blame the EU for not letting Scotland in - having one country that thinks it can bend all the rules because it thinks it is superior is bad enough, let alone two...",0,1392578162,null,0,false,0,cfgunl0,t3_1y1yyc,t1_cfgunl0,t3_1y1yyc,null,1432423865,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

I think what we could do is instead of showing al the results from each player we only display the number that has the most votes so if 20 people give henderson a 7 out of 10 but 19 give him a 1 out of 10 then we only show the 7, while not perfect it means player rating dont get effected by blatant trolling and the majority rules

I know quite a few people that have voted for them who have no interest in independence. The wave of public support behind them is because they have established themselves as a party capable of doing their job. Something the other three have been struggling to do for some time (not just in Scotland).

It is because of this level of competence that more people in Scotland are willing to trust them on the issue of running the country.

Any attempts to lower this debate to the reactions to a film or historical events is extremely patronising and is one of the leading reasons why so many Scots are fed up of being treated like rabid nationalists with a hatred of the English when that is simply not true. 

It seems to me the people who's views are being most affected by this film Braveheart, live south of the border since that is the local of the people who keep bringing the film up. Yes there are rabid nationalists, but like the EDL, they are the minority. Scottish people are far more sophisticated than that.

*Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead* is only necessary as an introduction to River Song. If you do not intend to continue into Moffat's era, then these episodes are not vital to understanding the show.

*Turn Left* is important to understanding the set-up for *The Stolen Earth/Journey's End*, and should be added to the list.

Oh gawd. I'm gonna get an 'F' but heregoes:

-Nurembergring is a bastard of a track that nobody wants to drive; it has 13 jumps: F1 cars aren't designed to jump. I believe it was designed by Hitler, or at least his men.

-Ayrton Senna was worshipped in Brazil, a national hero during an awful period of time for the country, his death was seen as a loss of hope for them.

-Engines used to be in the front of cars, the engine move to the back was via a British bloke tinkering around a bit (via F2 I think) and it *really* pissed the Italians off, as they ruled the roost at the time and were quite sneery about this bloke and his team of, I forget the term now, but basically 'home' mechanics.

-One accident caused 80 fatalities amongst the audience.

-An awful lot of the tech is taken from the aerospace industry, and for a time the industry nicked quite a few bits from the racing industry.

-Safety improvements only really came about after Ecclestone bought rights to televise F1 worldwide. At the time he offered an equal share of the rights to the 10 leading clubs/cars, rather diplomatic of him. At 100k a piece, they all decided it would be money better spent on car improvements etc. Well, more fool them. Anyway, TV rights = sponsorship = money to improve safety. However, drivers had been campaigning for better safety since the late 60s/early 70s, including boycotting racing at race tracks who refused to implement any of their safety demands. It was a long slow road. I believe 1976 was the first year in which there were no driver fatalities during a F1 season, and Senna's death in 1994 (whilst not the last fatality) was the last driver fatality.

-Despite what 'Rush' would have you believe, Hunt and Lauda were actually mates. Or became mates. The film just chose to cut that part out.

true,AidanSmeaton,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"I am quite surprised you have to ask, but I'm happy to answer if you genuinely don't know. I assure you, the drive for independence comes from very real issues today, not from history books.

Ultimately, the desire for independence comes from the desire to be self-governing and autonomous. So you have to ask, why would people prefer that over the status-quo? The answer is because Scottish people feel disenfranchised with Westminster. There is a large political (and to an extent, cultural) divide between Scotland and the south of England. London and the south has much more representation in Westminster than Scotland (which is fine, it's bigger). So when their policies don't align, Scotland *never* wins. As Westminster policies continue to be misaligned with Scotland's, Scottish people feel like their vote is too small to count for anything.

How do we know Scottish people are disenfranchised? Take a look at the [2011 Scottish Parliament general election](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Parliament_general_election,_2011), where the SNP (Scottish National Party) - *nothing like the BNP btw* - won by majority. The majority of Scots voted for a party which is not a major Westminster party, and this is very telling.

The SNP believe that Scotland is capable of being an autonomous and independent country. They believe it is important because it allows them to bypass Westminster politics. Even though the Scottish parliament already makes the majority of decisions affecting Scotland, with independence it can be *fully* autonomous. It will be able collect tax directly (not via Westminster) and can make decisions on tax, defense, and other areas it currently has no control over.

For all intents and purposes, Scotland is practically an independent country already (separate legal system, education, NHS, police, parliament...) - all the ingredients are there. The final step is to transfer full political power to the parliament, and this can only be done through independence.

We haven't had a proper labour government in several decades - Blair shifted his party to the right, and our ""finger up to the tories"" turned into unrestrained ""neo-liberal"" capitalism, a bunch of red-tie tories acting just the same as the blue-tie brigade.

The current process of land reform - the [2003 act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Reform_\(Scotland\)_Act_2003) and the [present review](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/About/Review/land-reform) - shows Scotland is committed to being a more egalitarian society.

Free university tuition is another illustration of those principles of equality and those English who complain about being treated differently from those born north of the border, well, we should have voted differently (as a nation), shouldn't we?

There are a lot of choices out there in the smartphone world, and it all depends on what you want. You have to compare both software and hardware (and price) and *a lot* of this stuff is subjective. I'm taking it you've decided to go on-contract, but bare in mind there are some phones that are much better deals if you buy the handset full price and pay monthly. I'm on mobile so you'll have to look up the exact prices of each device. I think £30/month can get you most phones with unlimited texts and some 3G. I'll lay down some info of devices I believe may be in your price range, as well as the 3 operating systems.

In (probably) descending order of price, the phones:

**Apple iPhone 5C**. I'm sure you've heard of iPhone. Apple is known for quality at a steep price, but the 5C is slightly cheaper. It still comes with good hardware (including the camera) and the screen is very small compared to other devices, comparatively low-res but great quality. Comes in a nice range of colours. Runs iOS.

**Samsung Galaxy S4** or **HTC One** or **LG G2** or **Sony Xperia Z1**. All similar phones on paper, they were top of the line last year. 1080p screens, great cameras, heavily skinned Android, but overall great phones. Samsung is unique in allowing an expandable memory *and* removable battery, while HTC provide some great front-facing speakers and metal build, LG a bigger screen and updated specs, and Sony top (waterproof) build quality. Each manufacturer's skin varies wildly from the others, you probably won't be able to recognise they are the same operating system!

**Nokia Lumia 1020**. The Windows Phone. It has an awesome camera but otherwise decent specs.

**Motorola Moto X**. Just released in the UK, this phone has a cult following in the US for doing more with less. Almost as small as the iPhone but with a much bigger screen, it feels great in the hand and has a few cool/handy features on top of nearly-stock Android. You sacrifice top of the line specs but everything is decent.

**Google/LG Nexus 5**. Top of the line specs at a great price (off-contract). Running stock Android, no phone can compete in the quality/price ratio. Big beautiful screen, but some sacrifices are made with the camera/battery life/speaker quality.

Now for the operating systems:

**iOS**. Has the most mature ecosystem, with some great apps and a quality look. Very stable, but this costs you freedom (unless you jailbreak) as Apple is very heavy-handed.

**Android**. The most open and feature-rich OS. Only a month or two behind iOS when it comes to apps, but known for being quirky/unstable (though this improves with every update). Each manufacturer ""skins"" Android, adding their own features. Some desirable, some not. The more ""stock"" experiences (Nexus and Moto) will get faster updates.

**Windows Phone**. This ecosystem is still years behind the competitors, its only saving graces are it is as stable as iOS for a lower price, and has a cool/unique look. It lacks features and apps.

Okay, that's it! I advise you play around with each phone yourself and see what you like.

I actually don't want to get into the he said she said of the three cases, but I don't think you've rebutted them at all. I don't think it was a coincidence that it was a Scotland v England match that happened to prompt an SNP politician to spend the night in the cells. I don't understand how you can read McAlpine's article and not think it is inflamatory. There may well have been riots 300 years ago, but the 300 years of peaceful cooperation that followed them are actually more important to my opinion of the UK than the riots - I think to have Neil's view you need to be looking for conflict (it was on Newsnight but I can't remember the date it just stuck with me). 

&gt;anyone who claims the Independence campaign is based on Anti-Englishness

That's not what I claimed at all. I listed those examples as illustrative rather than definitive of anti-English sentiment which I think exists among many prominent members of the SNP past and present. The long term campaign of othering, manufacturing of grievance and effort to create and escalate as many conflicts with the rest of the UK are what make me think there is a problem with an unhealthy anti-English chip on their shoulder in the SNP leadership, but its harder to put into reddit-comment format

I appreciate the point, the SNP have certainly been very competent as politicians. But what are their really good, original policies? My perception is that their major diversions from policy in the rest of the UK are negative, i.e. they wait until some policy becomes really unpopular, and then they reverse it- tuition fees, prescription charges, NHS reforms, bedroom tax etc. This is a very easy thing to do.

Internet firms condemn plans for GCHQ email access

A proposal to allow Cheltenham listening post GCHQ to monitor any email, phone call or website visit of people in the UK has been condemned by internet firms.

The London Internet Exchange, which represents more than 330 companies, including BT, Virgin and Carphone Warehouse, says the Government's surveillance proposals are an ""unwarranted"" invasion of people's privacy.

The £2 billion project, pioneered by former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, would allow the Benhall-based intelligence headquarters access to the records of internet providers in an effort to maintain its defences against terrorism.

The firms will be asked to collect and store vast amounts of data, including from social networking sites such as Facebook, although intelligence workers will not be able to view the actual content of emails and phone calls.

""defences against terrorism"" classic. 

The 'war on terror' is a con and in reality the Illuminati play the role of both terrorists and defenders in a dialectic to advance their NWO agenda. The CIA and most intelligence agencies serve the Illuminati bankers, not the countries that fund them.  

The recent arrest of CIA agent Raymond Davis in Pakistan reveals that Davis was working with with terrorist groups.

I remember something about you being an Essex boy. Is that what you confided in him about? That's a bit out of order sharing that...

&gt;dunno what's happened to him though

I attempted some sleuthing the other day and looks like he's deleted his account and moved to pastures new, a la Hazza, lamps, and myself. Not sure how much luck you'd have messaging him. :/

&gt;can we get some more info on your meet up with panties?

~~I'll pm you pictures~~ A gentleman never tells. *twirls moustache*

&gt;did she set some required reading prior to this meet up?

The Kama Sutra, actually. That was a little weird. 

Okay serious. **[Edit:** she'll likely come along and claim most of this is false, but you know what women are like.]

&gt;Can we get some more info?

Certainly.

&gt;Was it like a date?

Hmm...perhaps, in an unspoken kind of way. As far as I can remember it wasn't stated as such, it was just meeting up because we got on well talking and whatnot, though there were strong *undertones* and, I think I'll be allowed to say this (at the time I didn't want it shared), it ended with a kiss. She, however, was unsure whether or not she wanted to reciprocate, I valiantly persevered (ie didn't throw a wobbler and call her a prickteasing whore) though and next time we met up she'd pleasingly made her mind up.

&gt;How did it come about?

Kind of answered this just above, but I'll expand. She just let her attraction to me grow wild and uncontrollable, insisted we meet up.

McAplines article is inflammatory but not against the English, The article makes the MoD position clear that the danger posed to the population in Scotland is considered less prominent than the danger posed if it were berthed in southern England, what she fails to mention is the different placement that would present itself but still the point stands, the risks of owning Nuclear weapons and the waste produced by them is shouldered disproportionately by Scotland because the MoD wants to keep it as far from London as possible.

perhaps your view of the 300 years is where the difference comes in, I personally think that the majority of the time where Scotland (and indeed many other parts of the UK) have seen improvement it is because it was deemed beneficial to the ruling elite in London for it to happen, not because we are in a fair union. so for someone who views the whole history of the UK as being an unhappy marriage then that would be an apt analogy.

So it is a general Idea you have of the attitude, nothing wrong with that and I know those are difficult to articulate but isn't it possible that your belief that this is the case is causing you to see examples of this where none exist, don't get me wrong, there is a minuscule percent of people in Scotland who hold such narrow views (Vice Versa in England) but the idea that those people could all unite and form such a far reaching campaign while keeping the true narrow motivation hidden is frankly laughable.",0,1392583581,null,0,false,0,cfgwwrz,t3_1y29dt,t1_cfgwwrz,t1_cfgwge5,null,1432424930,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm thinking of people such as Gordon Brown (obviously) but also Alistair Darling, Douglas Alexander, Margaret Curran, Michael Moore, et al. In the past, there were other famous Scots wielding power at Westminster and/or in the major parties including, of course, John Smith. Many more Labour examples, of course, but it would appear that Scotland has been fairly well represented at Westminster.

&gt;For all intents and purposes, Scotland is practically an independent country already (separate legal system, education, NHS, police, parliament...) - all the ingredients are there. The final step is to transfer full political power to the parliament, and this can only be done through independence.

Agreed. But one cannot have true political independence without both fiscal and monetary independence also. I feel the currency issue will be the undoing of the ""Yes"" campaign.

Specifically the historical emnity between Scotland and England and the general pre-union days. Otherwise all of those things you just said could apply to any given area in the UK. If we ignore history, the westcountry also has a pretty decent case for wanting independence, and even that case pales in comparison to many parts of the north of England. 

Feeling disenfranchised by an apparent focus on London and the *south east* (not the general south) is not the sole preserve of Scotland. 

To me this means there is something else: the historical enmity between the two countries. That is the only thing that makes independence an option, instead of doing what the rest of the country does and grumble about ineffective and unrepresentative governance. 

And going back to my first comment in this thread, I find that a little hypocritical. Scotland, as a culture and a geography, is so intertwined with England and such a part of British colonialism that it is frankly hypocritical to claim Scotland is oppressed by the English in the very system it worked so very hard to set up! 

As I say... The non-historical basis for Scottish independence has as much merit as the independence of Manchester, or Somerset or Yorkshire. 

And the historical basis is hypocritical and largely false. 

Speaking personally, I'd not like the Scots to secede. Only because I like to visit and quite like the idea, practically speaking, of being in the same country still. Boring, but y'know.

My opinion?  Well, I guess the obvious point to make is it clearly a way of widening the motorways on the cheap.  It only really works in densely populated areas where junctions come thick and fast but being able to open up a hard shoulder three quarters of a mile before a junction for people who are exiting the motorway has had a noticeable impact on congestion. 

The variable speed limits get largely ignored, people still tend just to drive to the flow of the traffic, but I think the **STAY IN LANE** warnings when there is congestion has a noticeable positive effect too. Traffic jams are definitely made worse by the cunts (and I choose my words carefully here) who constantly weave between lanes because they are convinced everybody else is going faster than they are. 

So on the whole I am for them.  They only really work in certain locations, but I think they are definitely a good way of more effectively managing traffic than just leaving people to figure stuff out for themselves and they are significantly cheaper than adding extra lanes to the carriageway.  I suspect in 20-30 years all motorways surrounding major urban areas, airports, ports and other locations which are prone to heavy congestion will have been upgraded.

I spend all day driving around Bristol for my job. I believe that city and the volume of traffic itself is the best regulator of speed. My trip computer says that i average around 13mph on a given day. I also rarely reach 30mph and if i do, i don't stay there for long!!!!

The only time i have noticed this 20mph speed limit is on main roads: cranbrook rd, anchor road, hotwells road etc - where it has been a negative experience as a driver as it seems to be far to slow and not the natural speed of the road. This causes both frustration and aggressive driving. I have seen lots of tailgating due to it - i think this is far more dangerous that going 30!

There is also no point on putting the 20mph limit on the back roads of residential areas. The narrowness of the roads and the volume of traffic keeps the speed average well below 20mph.

Also, the police have openly said they will not actively stop anyone going 30mph in a 20mph zone...

Whats the point?! waste of money, time and resources! Fix the pot holes and put in more cycle lanes - not pointless these 20mph signs!!

&gt;she article makes the MoD position clear that the danger posed to the population in **a remote sheltered glen 40 miles away from any major population center in** Scotland is considered less prominent than the danger posed if it were berthed **a specific alternative port in a city center** in southern England,

&gt;perhaps your view of the 300 years is where the difference comes in, I personally think that the majority of the time where Scotland (and indeed many other parts of the UK) have seen improvement it is because it was deemed beneficial to the ruling elite in London for it to happen, not because we are in a fair union. so for someone who views the whole history of the UK as being an unhappy marriage then that would be an apt analogy.

Yes, it is a fair analogy for someone who has an anti-English chip on their shoulder. That was the crux of my point. 

&gt;So it is a general Idea you have of the attitude, nothing wrong with that and I know those are difficult to articulate but isn't it possible that your belief that this is the case is causing you to see examples of this where none exist, don't get me wrong, there is a minuscule percent of people in Scotland who hold such narrow views (Vice Versa in England) but the idea that those people could all unite and form such a far reaching campaign while keeping the true narrow motivation hidden is frankly laughable.

Gie us peace, I didn't claim there was a conspircy at work. Having an anti-English chip on your shoulder doesn't begin and end with shouting freedom and throwing bottles at Yorkshiremen - it's very often blaming all our ills on an geographically and nationally specific set of bogiemen.

The SNP agrees that real independence means fiscal and monetary independence. They are also well known for being pragmatic and practical, and their solution is in the interest of both countries. They propose to continue using the same currency as part of a formal [currency union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_union). This is how many countries with similar economies around the world are able to be independent, but trade efficiently.

Of course, this *looks* like a bad idea when we look at the Euro (the largest formal currency union ever between countries with drastically different economies). The economies of Germany and Greece are disparate, whereas the economies of Scotland and the rest of the UK are very similar. The risk is not nearly as high for a Sterling union as it is for the Eurozone countries.

**I'm glad you mentioned Belgium!** A comparable example is the [currency union between Belgium and Luxembourg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium%E2%80%93Luxembourg_Economic_Union) (1922-2002). Until both countries joined the Euro, Luxembourg was able to be a fully independent country while operating in an economic union with Belgium (a country 20 times larger). Yes, Luxembourg could have operated with its own currency, but it was in the interest of both countries (not just Luxembourg) to share a currency.

Unless the ""Yes"" campaign can get this concept across succinctly and clearly, I also agree that this will be their undoing. They are relying on the UK being reasonable about coming to an amicable solution, but the UK obviously doesn't want to give the idea any credit at the moment.

true,Owner_of_GoalDotCom,null,null,"&gt;What a load of shit, the stats show that Anfield is the loudest ground in Britain. With 15000 less people you should feel ashamed.

Who cares about the stats of decibels. It's well known that the Anfield atmosphere these days is nothing special, even your own fans have been saying it. I could hardly hear you when you were 4-0 up against your local rivals or when you were beating one of the best teams in the country 4-0 in 20 minutes? Anfield is nothing special.

&gt;And how can you prove your going to be more successful?

All signs point towards us being successful. Due to our amazing business deals of recent times and the Emirates, we have 120m to spend on transfers. You'll be panic buying like Spurs trying to replace Suarez in the summer while we'll be buying world class players like last year.

&gt;We have a young manager who brings through youth and is going to be around for the long run. Can also pick out a bargain.
You have an old man who will retire soon, knows fuck-all about winning anything, also shit with transfers.

Holy fuck you are ignorant! Hahahahaha you thing Rodgers is better than Wenger....hilarious. What has Rodgers ever accomplished? Compare him to Wenger....lol.

Okay let's go through this step by step. ""We have a young manager ... you have an old man"" Being young doesn't give you an advantage...lol.

&gt;brings through youth and is going to be around for the long run

Ah yes the incredible youth prospects of Jorden Henderson and Joe Allen. Wenger's terrible with bringing in youth prospects for the future...Wilshere, Chamberlain, Gnabry, Szczesny, Gibbs, Ramsey....all rubbish. Would much rather have Allen.

""Can also pick out a bargain"" Ah yes the incredible bargian of Joe Allen for 15m. Wenger never makes good bargains. Henry for 14m, Toure for 225k, Campbell for free, Vieira for 2m, Fabregas for 800k, Pires for 8m, Mertesacker for 8m, Koscielny for 10m, Sagna for 7m, Lehmann for free. Never makes bargians. Sturridge....signing of the century.

&gt;knows fuck-all about winning anything

Ah yes Wenger's only won 2 French leagues, 1 French Cup, 4 FA Cups and 3 Premier League's. Rodgers hasn't ever won anything so clearly he's better when it comes to winning things.

&gt; also shit with transfers.

lol....just lol.

&gt;Our future is brighter because big clubs never fade away, your not a big club

Ah yes I've heard this all before. We're not a big club even though we've won the third most titles because we haven't won the Champions League. Oh but Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa are big clubs but they never faded away did they? They never faded into mediocrity did they? Hint: they did.

""Our future is brighter because we have a younger manager who bought Sturridge and our club won Champions Leagues even though you have much better finances and better players young and old!"" -Scouser. lol...just lol.

Grant Holt admits he is still developing as a player under Villa boss Paul Lambert – even as the oldest player in the claret and blue dressing room.

The 32-year-old target man was recruited for his experience during the January transfer window on a loan deal from Championship club Wigan until the end of the season.

But, although the average age of Lambert’s squad is under 25, elder statesman Holt accepts he is still learning the game himself, especially at Premier League level.

“You never stop learning,” said Holt.

“It’s always different when you come into a new team.

“You’ve got to learn quickly. It’s going to take me a while to realise what certain people do, their different strengths, how different people play.

“That’s the only way you’ll get better by adapting to other people as well as looking after your own game.”

“He’s pretty similar to how he (Lambert) was at Norwich,” said Holt.

“You know what to expect from him. He expects a level of performance and of endeavour in training and in games and he’s not changed in that respect.

“If you don’t buy into that then you’re certainly not part of his thoughts. You’ve got to get there quickly, do things right and get up to speed.”

“It’s been fantastic, the lads have been welcoming and I’ve settled in well,” he said. “I’m just enjoying it really.

“I’m glad to be involved with a bunch of lads who want to win games. The group that the gaffer’s got here are fit and strong and that’s what kind of side he likes. It’s nice to be part of something.

“To be back involved in the Premier League has given me that bit of belief. I hadn’t started a game for three months before I came here so it’s about finding your feet and keeping going and I’ve been happy with my performances.”",0,1392588904,null,0,false,0,cfgz3st,t3_1y3btz,t1_cfgz3st,t3_1y3btz,null,1432426031,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2

You'd expect them to say this, but the Treasury doesn't agree with you! See below:

https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/279460/Sir_Nicholas_Macpherson_-_Scotland_and_a_currency_union.pdf

They make the point (amongst others) that a currency union would not, by definition, be fiscal independence for Scotland. The Bank Rate would still be set by the Bank of England; and fiscal policy - set to promote the aims of rUK and not Scotland - would lead to the break-up of the currency in time.

I've not studied the Belgium–Luxembourg Economic Union, so I won't comment further until I can. But, at first glance, both countries are tiny in relation to the UK. Perhaps this is relevant... I am also wondering how the fiscal side of that Union stood up and who was in control. There also seem to be quite a few currency unions working well out there, albeit involving quite small countries. Interesting...

In summary, I haven't the faintest idea if it would work or not. I have some reading to do.

To be honest the only reason the SNP got its majority and the referendum is that they governed well and followed through on what they campaigned on and not jerking the Scottish people around too much. They gained their prominence not through the promising indy ref but by showing up the other parties by not bullshitting when in elections and listening more to what people wanted not to happen compared to what the UK govt were attempting to implement. Its that bedrock that gives them the space to be able to not give a probably more pragmatic and less rosy view of an independent Scotland and still have support for independence. Its a mixture of both that in the end doesn't give people alot of certainty but also doesn't dampen optimism over independence. George Osbornes speech has just angered people and felt more a threat than a clarification on policy in a possible future.

true,refjones,null,null,"Good question (as it's always good to know how one's country is run).

Basically, it's because of the concept of ""Short Money"".  
Short Money is provided here in the UK to opposing parties annually to ""enable Opposition parties more effectively to fulfil their Parliamentary functions"" and was made / devised by Edward Short in the 1970-80s.

It consists of two payments / versions. ""Short Money"" for the Commons and ""Cranborne Money"" for the Lords.

*(I'll reference a lot from [Wikipedia][1] on the topic)* 

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Money

The scheme has three components:

1. Funding to assist an opposition party in carrying out its Parliamentary business
2. Funding for the opposition parties’ travel and associated expenses
3. Funding for the running costs of the Leader of the Opposition’s office

The amount of money received is calculated as follows:

* General funding for Opposition Parties  
 Eligible parties receive £14,015 for every seat won at the last election plus £27.99 for every 200 votes gained by the party.

* Travel Expenses for Opposition Parties  
 £153,956 is apportioned between each of the Opposition parties in the same proportion as the amount given to each of them under the 'General Funding' scheme set out above.

* Leader of the Opposition’s Office  
 £652,936 is available for the running costs of the Leader of the Opposition’s office for the financial year commencing on 1 April 2008. In addition, the Leader of the Opposition, the Opposition Chief Whip and the Assistant Opposition Whip receive a salary from public funds, on top of their parliamentary salary: £73,617, £41,370 and £26,624 respectively. 

# ` `

This is important because without it, in ELI(##) style, funding may be heavily skewed towards the majority party / parties which could lead to many problems.

It's also why Theseusperse's post is interesting.

As the opposition parties *automatically* get Short and Cranborne Money (and as mandated), should one include them in when posting about donors to political parties?  
Leaving that to the readers of this post and sub-reddit, of course.

# ` `

Without Short and Carnbourne Money, the new ""total"" public funds paid to political parties would be:

Party	 | Financial assistance to parties (Scottish Parliament) | Policy Development Grants (Electoral Commission) | Total
---------|---------|---------|---------
Labour Party | £137,744 | £455,106 | £592,850
Liberal Democrats | £37,030 | £455,095 | £492,125
Conservative and Unionist Party | £112,969 | £341,307 | £454,276
Scottish National Party (SNP) | £0 | £171,459 | £171,459
Plaid Cymru - The Party of Wales | £0 | £151,482 | £151,482
Scottish Green Party | £13,252 | £0 | £13,252
Green Party | £0 | £0 | £0

Well, those services have been in a continual process of change since they were started, and there's nothing magical about where they were when responsibility was devolved. For instance, the NHS had an internal market introduced during the 80s, by the Thatcher government. It's an odd position, because the SNP are essentially sticking with the status quo, yet they argue that there is a compelling case that the status quo has delivered unacceptable results.

&gt; Anyway, they are currently still only a devolved government so I think they have little option for anything really radical.

I thought the Scottish government had complete devolved responsibility for criminal justice, education and health. And that must be true, because otherwise they would not have been able to block free schools, and the NHS reforms. So why haven't they actually enacted some reforms of their own?

A few years later, we changed to UKRocketTrolls as I really liked using RPGs as a primary weapon, fuck playing to win etc. We made it pretty popular and hit 100 members which was the max, were listed on Cod Elite and started going competitive, with that though we picked up a lot of seriously skilled people who also happened to be total fucknuts, so I shut up shop, started a new username and invited a few chosen to do the same. They followed suit, starting a ____-Strange thing to looK a little bit more organised in lobbies.   
  
  It's a lot less serious now, we just meet up and get pissed on mic and stoned and chat shit, go IRL paintballing once a year and it's good. Less than 30 of us now, much more manageable and fun, and we've kicked out all the controversial dicks.

It's part 2, you can watch the rest but this is the factual part. Wait till you see the GDP distribution, and the income distribution (higher than average GDP, lower than average income).   

So not only is there political disenfranchisement - Scotland never votes Tory - but also economic disenfranchisement. 

Combine that with the general Scottish bashing you see in the media, and the general disdain they receive, it's natural. Example recently: the mens British Olympic curling team was referred to as the English team on the BBC, when they're actually all Scottish. When they corrected it, they called them British. If the athlete's English, then English is what they're called. You don't notice these things when you're English, but it's common for Scots. 

People in England still think Scotland is a shitty backwater which could never survive alone, which is completely false as well. I have lived in the south (and I'm currently in England for a job) and it's the general feeling people here have. It's a shame, because it's totally false.

true,OhWhyBother,null,null,"Hey /u/Swederman, we need your minutes-played-by-each-player graphic in here, stat!

The article touches upon some valid questions and has some interesting points but has some egregious claims as well. For instance, IIRC, Javi Garcia was injured during our last match, which is why Demichelis started. The same was the case with Milner, I think? However, I agree, with the overall sentiment of the article that Jose's plan B is almost always found wanting. 

### My gripe with Willian

For all the running around and pressing that Willian does so effectively, I am yet to see him provide a good key pass/cross or a memorable assist to the striker. Let's pull up some stats, shall we? According to WhoScored, Willian has managed:

* **23/81 accurate crosses** and has an average of **1.4** accurate crosses per game. 
* **43/56 accurate long balls** and has average of **2.5** per game. 
* **37 key passes** and has an average of **2.2** key passes per game.

Believe it or not, Willian's stats, as outlined above, are the best of the three starting AMs in the squad: among Hazard, Oscar and Willian. And yet, he has only **one assist** and **two goals** to show for his efforts in his 16 (=12+4) PL appearances so far. A case of statistics not revealing the entire picture?

### Strikers? What strikers?
The fact that Torres managed only FOUR passes in his 30 minutes on the pitch (WhoScored says 50% of his passes never made it to the intended target) and ZERO shots, says a lot. Eto'o wasn't any better either - he managed 6 passes, with a 67% accuracy. Eto'o's replacement at halftime, Md. Salah, in his 45 minutes on the pitch had 14 passes.

In fact, since his hattrick at Man Utd, Eto'o has been very industrious but with very little to show for his efforts.

### Luiz isn't the problem, I think
People in here were blaming Luiz for the goal(s) we conceded but not everyone here seems to understand the difference between Luiz and Cahill's playing styles. Luiz made 5 interceptions and 3 clearances, while Cahill made one interception and 7 clearances. 

What does this tell us? IMHO, Luiz prefers to press higher up which results in a few attacks being nipped in the bud while Cahill has excellent reflexes when it comes to last-ditch attempts at saving goals - kinda like Cole, last year.


### JT, we miss you...
I've seen a few claims that we sorely missed JT. Yes, we did. JT and Cahill are the same type of defenders - they prefer to draw in the attackers and then stand-off against them giving them very little space in the final part of their run and eventually executing a spectacular block or a clearance. Their defensive discipline is almost identical and this mutual understanding allows them to be a better cohesive unit than any of the other pairings.

An additional advantage of having JT is that Jose could have deployed Luiz in the midfield to face Yaya instead of Mikel. Mikel is solid when it comes to one-track midfielders but as soon as he comes face-to-face with an opposite number with more technical ability than him (like Yaya or Garcia) he goes AWOL and it became painfully clear during this match.

### ...and you too, Ashley!
If anyone deserved a start today, it was probably Cole - unless he was injured, that is. Brana &amp; Cahill in the centre, with Azpi and Cole flanking them, Luiz, Matic and Ramires in midfield - with Ramires given a free run of the central channel and the right wing. Hazard &amp; Oscar would be deployed as the free-roaming, attacking duo behind Eto'o. 

^(You could switch Ramires for Willian and have a more of a 4-2-3-1 than the flexible 4-3-3 that Ramires provides.)

### Baggies' day out...
The West Brom game was where rotation was required and never happened. It was a good opportunity to (maybe) rest Hazard and Oscar and give Schuerrle &amp; Salah some game time. Ashley could have started the Baggies' game and Azpi could have been rested, couldn't he? What's happening there, I wonder?

### Transfer WIN-dow?
Our January window was a little weird, IMHO. We trimmed and strengthened our midfield (overall) and weakened our defensive depth, which is surprising considering how much Jose prefers his teams to be defensively strong.

But the PM and Chancellors recent speeches have not had whatever their desired effect from what I can tell from my circle of friends but its actual effect has certainly shifted the guys on the fence off it and into the yes camp at least with my friends. The PM made his speech in London close to Westminster(although in the Olympic village) which is what a lot of people are wanting to get away from's influence to speak to Scotland?  The Olympics were good but they don't hold a candle to what makes me feel disenfranchised with the Union. 

Chancellor comes to Scotland at least but comes to threaten under the pretense of a stance that is hard to believe wont at the very least be looked at again in the event of a yes vote to smooth over the the separation. And also to prevent disruption to business as much as possible i would think aswell. Plus there was the senior [coalition](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/yes-does-not-mean-yes.23438016) source saying that the UK would ""just ignore"" a yes vote?

Consequently, we have a greater hope and expectation than Ajax might that our players will stay and achieve success with and for us, rather than moving on elsewhere.

&gt;now people understand why I applauded Pellegrini for insisting that Lescott not be sold or loaned out this January window despite multiple interested parties)..that is what depth in a squad does when it is used ..it gives you different options and looks. Pellegrini used his, Jose refused to use his.

He's right, but using Lescott isn't the greatest comparison.

&gt;So why did we lose and why were we so poor? We lost because we ran into a side that has greater quality , greater depth and who were coached by a man who understands the need for squad rotation and implements it while our manager stubbornly persists with playing his perceived ""first 11"" no matter what.

Again it's a great point, although I disagree with the greater quality part, we have a great squad, the problem is with the way we play it doesn't show, any team can play the counter attack game, but will it show the quality of the team? No it doesn't, chemistry does, and we lack it and have done for months.

Yeah I have mixed feelings.  I'm grateful to him for headlining the return of the show I've long loved. 

But I'm also still angry at him for quitting during the first season and throwing that whole return into jeopardy.  

I know now that the show is a huge success and able to survive that, and of course had always been able to regenerate it's lead actor.  But at the time, only the first few episides had aired when his decision to quit was announced.  There was the very real risk that if the show hadn't proved popular so quickly, that the BBC would have cut their losses, or that the new generation of viewers wouldn't stick with a new show knowing that the actor who headlines it isn't sticking around either. 

So yeah.  Grateful to him for bringing it back, but have never forgiven him for rising destroying it all before it had a chance to flourish.

As I say, this is such a negative attitude, and is the reason we didn't win under Moyes. 

The FA Cup is our Champions League final. It is a huge competition, and it matters more than money and more than league positions. Maybe if you are a supporter from the 'new world' of football then you won't understand the significance, but believe me when I say; to the man on the street supporter of one of the non-huge clubs in Britain, winning The FA Cup would go down as one of the greatest moments they could wish for. 

I don't care if some managers don't take it as seriously as they should- or the money isn't great.. For me The Cup is the epitome of football- nothing hurt me more as a fan than the semi loss to Liverpool a few years back, and us winning the lot was one of my most vivid memories as a kid (although I was only 9).

It is certainly a heart competition than a head one, so it is impossible for newer fans to comprehend.. But that is why it is so special. ",0,1392595821,null,0,false,0,cfh1vw0,t3_1y2bry,t1_cfh1vw0,t1_cfgstei,null,1432427341,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1

Standard practice. Connecting it into the main socket bypasses the internal extension wiring to see if its a fault on your side or the BT side of the line.

So to sum up:

You've got a problem on your line and you're pissed because Sky CS wanted you to do some rudimentary fault elimination to save a BT engineer turning up, testing the line and telling you the extension points you had installed were fucked and the source of all your woe which comes with a £150 bill as its not on the BT side of the phone socket.

He didn't send Gerrard off today because he knew he fucked up the penalty decision, not because Gerrard gets some free pass.

I don't buy that Webb is purposely harming us, he is simply a coward. He tries so hard to keep big games under control that he does not exercise the right amount of discipline (see the World Cup final, and certain points today where Arsenal were making foul after foul but he didn't do anything - how Podolski and Arteta escaped without yellows is amazing). He makes baffling decisions at crucial times, yet because of his appearance and experience as a police officer people actually believe he is some tough no nonsense ref. 

If he really was out to get us he wouldn't have given the first pen, he didn't give the second because it was difficult for him personally to give two penalties for the 'serial cheat' Suarez within minutes of each other.

It is similar to Arsenal's problem with Mike Dean, where he seems to give every major decision against them.

If as we've been told for decades the private sector really does do things better than the public sector they'll deliver on that and profit from doing so.  Whether it's because they can drive down costs, provide a better service for the same price or come up with some other form of innovation.

If on the other hand they don't do anything better but accrue profits for their shareholders they won't be able to compete, though under a capitalist model that's probably desirable.

*(There's a secondary issue in this insofar as a new competitor might hit the asset value of a business like British Gas, which would have an effect on institutional investors a large part of whom tend to be pension investments.  Personally I don't think they're delivering and this would be ok, but it's something you'd have to consider.)*

This would work perfectly adequately for probably every form of business where there is *(or is purported to be)* some form of open competition.  So energy suppliers and banks where you see cartel style behaviour could be regulated by this.  Before he sold the last of his credibility Vince Cable actually proposed something vaguely similar with the banks.  *(He didn't go quite this far, but he proposed keeping one state run bank as a means of influencing the behaviour and conduct of the others.)*

Where it wouldn't work is where you have an infrastructure providers like Transco or where you have franchises that aren't actually in competition like the train companies.

Given Westminster's constitutional conservatism it's not likely to change in the near or medium distance future.

As to Westminster not affecting us, the majority of the tax rates are set in Westminster. Foreign policy is a matter reserved exlusively to Westminster (war and such like). Drug policy, telecomms, the postal service, welfare, nuclear weapons and a bunch of other stuff. Those are not 'wee things', despite what Johann Lamont might try to convince people. 

As to Brussels, an Independent Scotland within the EU would, like every other member state, have its own MEPs commisioners, veto rights, and votes for QMV issues. Granted, further enlargment (whether internal or external) might trigger a new treaty about unanimity, and so on but, as it stands, Scotland would be better represented as an independent member of the EU with more MEPs as a proportion of population (as opposed to less now) and a veto right (as opposed to hoping that Wesminster will choose to excercise its on Scotland's behalf, which doesn't necessarily follow).

I don't think that it is really all that irrelevant. Many Scots seem to think that the English despise them and want to keep them down, but the fact that so many of the most powerful offices of state have been filled by Scots as of late suggests that this isn't the case. 

If Scotland votes to become independent the north, especially the north east, will become even more irrelevant than it already is. I think there may be a case for part of the North to become Scottish rather than remain English as their economy will be more affected by Scotland than England. They would certainly be of a similar political outlook. ",0,1392601712,null,0,false,0,cfh4bl0,t3_1y29dt,t1_cfh4bl0,t1_cfh0npw,null,1432428489,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Using a £12 bundle, and assuming £10 for ""extras"" every 4 months, you'd spend £348. Compare this to your £30 a month max budget of £720 over 24 months, and you have £370 to spend on a phone. That'll get you a Nexus 5, IMO one of the best phones on the market today.


I've made this sound kinda complicated, but it's really quite simple to set up, and also means you're not tied in to a contract.

Attempting to establish a colony and failing also doesn't demonstrate your point. England had successfully established far more colonies before the Darien Scheme was even conceived. 

Basically, your argument is full of shit and screams far more of revisionism than omitting the bribes paid to English MPs from a story that isn't altered by the omission.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;But the location of my car parking has not changed.

Right, but the evaluation of the risk in which your car is in while parked has. The risk isn't increased as such, it's just that the model which figures out what risk your car is under has taken into account a change in factors and so has re-evaluated the risk.

&gt;I also don[t think a near 33% rise is ""rational"".

That's probably because you dislike paying a 33% increase.

&gt;Surely too, it should mean everyone on the street should have their premiums rise?

To an extent it will increase the premiums of everyone in the immediate area. However everyone on the street is different, some will park their cars there more than others. There are limits to how accurately we can model the world, and so other drivers are unlikely to see a direct immediate increase in their rates, but rather just a generalised increase which follows from having your car in a more accident prone area.

&gt;Surely the insurance i had on the car factored in the risk of a DUI crashing into it...so that risk should remain the same.

The insurance you had would have been based on the rate of accidents in the area prior to this drunk drivers crash, among many other variables. The actual risk to your car hasn't changed, just the evaluation of the risk to your car has changed (in theory, and hopefully, it has become closer to reality).

&gt;Heck evenif you argued it did, it hasn't got 33% riskier.

When you pay insurance you're not paying the amount that you're actually projected to use, you pay a fraction of that and the insurance company works on the basis that, e.g. 90 out of 100 people will never claim. As such, insurance rates are subject to relatively large changes percentage wise because you're only actually paying a fraction of the cost of potential damages. Say you're paying 1% of the projected cost of your usage in the event of a serious crash, now you're paying 1.33%. It seems like a big change to you, but not to them.

&gt;There was literally nothing I could do to stop that happening except for not parking there

Right, you got unlucky. That sucks, and you have my sympathies. Unfortunately for you, if you *hadn't* parked there you wouldn't have had this increase in your insurance.

&gt;.which is EXACTLY what I pay insurance for in the first place.

You pay insurance so that you get money if your car gets broken. That does not mean that your insurance won't go up if the risk you present to the insurance company is re-evaluated at a higher level.

&gt;This still seem ""rational""?

true,iMADEthis2post,null,null,"See when you come at it from that angle you place rape as a purely female problem but rape is anything but. Canadian studies are showing that most partnership rapes are actually committed by young women, same with DV actually but that's nothing new. So really you have to ask what you find more distasteful, women hitting walls or men speaking up. Generally, even though they may not realize it the general population is very anti male. You can admit that or you can go back into your hole and watch the world pass you by.

Oh and if you think my opinion is in any way wrong I can direct you towards my academic feminist female unit who will give you pretty much the opinion I have but you may stop for a moment and listen because she has a vagina and must know what she is talking about.

Now, listen to me. Rape culture is driven by feminism and it devalues the female in a futile attempt at a power struggle, which is all feminism is in the west these days. Do you need someone with a vagina to take you through it and hold your hand while they explain why feminism is not always a good thing, for men *or* women?

Recommended reading: The Morning after: Sex, Fear, and Feminism *by Katie Roiphe* It's a feminists take on the rape crisis feminism taking hold in American colleges way back in 1993.

The current rape culture or rape climate or whatever you want to call it is driven by what was extremist feminism but has now settled into the mainstream. It is not driven by men or the patriarchy or any of that drivel, we are where we are now because of the mistakes that feminism made which have quite frankly poisoned society and created a gender divide which has set the egalitarian movement back decades. Feminism made it a crime to question it or in any way account for the needs and rights of men.

I'm not going to call you a crazy feminist just because you're a feminist but the way you are coming at me is suggesting that you are a feminist blind to the realities of the world. My SO will no longer identify as a feminist publicly because of the child like mentality which fills the bulk of the feminist community.

If you still have any fight in you we can talk about the 1in4 rape statistics that feminism keeps throwing around and I can tell you how 3/4 of the women the study says were raped actually didn't agree they were raped, they had that box ticked for them, actually read that book, it goes into the 1in4 statistics as it happens. So tell me, in regard to rape why should I respect what feminists have to say about it when they are denying 3/4 of all the ""raped women"" the right to call the sex they have consensual? How can anyone respect people with that mentality?

My conservative guess is that we end the season with 76pts. That assumes we draw against City, Chelsea, Spurs, and United, while losing away at Southampton (who just sort of make me nervous, even with their recent dip). It's a conservative guess, and there are plenty of opportunities to out-perform, and so getting a points tally in the low to mid 80s is doable.

That figure might just be enough to win the title. Of all the current Top 4 teams, Liverpool have arguably the easiest schedule (especially now since we're out of the Cup). This only really negates another weakness in the team- lack of depth- but it's something. Meanwhile, the teams ahead of us have their own vulnerabilities, and have more games against tougher teams. We also have an ace up our sleeve- Anfield, which has become a fortress again, and City and Chelsea still to visit.

true,jimmysilverrims,bronze,Eccleston,"In terms of just being an incredibly solid season, Series One has yet to be beat.

Each episode manages to really neatly interlock with the rest in a really natural way. 

Rose's father's death is introduced in *The Unquiet Dead* and pays off in *Father's Day*. Mickey and Jackie are introduced in the pilot, return for several episodes down the road, and play a large part in the finale. Blom is introduced in *Aliens in London* and comes into full in *Boom Town*. We learn of there being some meddling with the humans' future in *The Long Game* and discover who's behind it in *Bad Wolf*.

In fact, just the way that the Time War was handled was absolutely superb. In *Rose* we hear about there being a war. In *The End of the World* we learn of the deaths of the Time Lords and the destruction of Gallifrey. In *Dalek* we learn that the conflict was against the Daleks, and that the Doctor was responsible.

The chemistry between Piper and Eccleston, the excellently consistent tone between episodes... It all contributes into making this season feel like one incredibly solid journey for the characters. Just a really great start to Doctor Who coming back.",0,1392609008,null,0,false,0,cfh7eg6,t3_1y43p6,t1_cfh7eg6,t3_1y43p6,null,1432430006,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

It is surprisingly easy to delete those troll responses, mind you, more have probably popped up since this thread/appeal. The response to these surveys isn't that big, so sometimes it gets blown out or proportion. You'll also get the attention seekers with their copypasta and it's easy for us to ignore. They don't feature in the final rating if/when I average all the results and stats up, but I can't remove them from the live results. If we look at the survey with the previous result over arsenal, [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1MCD01yUUjsMcQbcnyKtTh16p-nFkOLrEEoB3mHIISW4/viewanalytics).

 Absolute different story. It's obvious where the *majority* of those trolls are coming from in this instance.  I would like to stress, don't go to their subreddit just to troll, I'm sure they get annoyed just as much as we do. You can observe, participate if you feel it would add to their discussion, just don't do it for the ""lulz"".

I've thought about hiding the live summary page, but some people like to see that and talk about their own or complain about other peoples ratings. And that's fine. Some people don't see the point to the survey, some people pm me when I am late or don't post it. That's reddit.

The timing of the survey also seems to be an issue for some. Asked the question over two surveys and they wanted it straight after the game. Also, not too big of a fan of cluttering up the front page with stickies every week. But that could change.

Will tally up the suggestions in this thread to see what can be improved. Another user has offered to do these and it does look like an improvement.
