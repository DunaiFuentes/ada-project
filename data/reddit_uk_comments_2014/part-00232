true,Thetonn,eng-sussex,Sussex,"To point out that a citizens income would be good without giving the details of how you would pay for it is intellectually dishonest.

Would giving people money benefit the economy? Of course it would. Yes, there would be some inflation, but the benefits would outweigh them. This also applies to tax cuts and pretty much all competant state spending.

The question is 1) how do you pay for it? 2) is it better for the economy on a simple opportunity cost? 3) is it better for the poorest on a simple opportunity cost.

1 is important but boring, so the people proposing just make the same grand assertions associated with tax cuts (they'll pay for themselves, they benefit X group at the cost of Y, but I like X and Y are wankers, so its good, anyone with half a brain can do this)

2) is the big one. Would it be better if, rather than giving people money, instead the state spent that money on say, education programs which are better proven to work for the poor, social clubs which help get people off the street, drug rehabilitation programs, insert lots of programs here. For a basic income to mean anything, this is going to be the cost. 

3) is the more interesting one. Is it right to give millionaires £10,000 rather than giving them nothing and giving more money to poor people? Why are we taking money from poor people and then giving it to rich people for doing nothing irrespective of need? Why when our hospitals need funds, libraries are being closed, populist issue Z is at hand, why?

I am yet to hear a proper argument for the basic income which does not exclusively have the benefits of mere increases in the welfare budget while being significantly less efficient.",0,1407703157,null,0,false,0,cjmh9z7,t3_2d5mug,t1_cjmh9z7,t3_2d5mug,null,1435171100,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

true,Inevitabile,null,null,"I have a few points in response to this. 
For context, I am on my first smartphone (as of Christmas), and chose Giffgaff for the unlimited data. That's it. I don't think I've ever used 10 minutes in a month, or more than 100 odd texts. 

I don't know about the actual demographics (and I see a post from you in the community thread saying you don't have it either?!), but every single person I've met on giffgaff is on it for the cheaper unlimited data than anyone else (a feature you propose to get rid of by pricing above other networks). Every single one. 

As to data, I don't think I've ever gone over 1 GB in a month. Of the people who I could quickly ask who use giffgaff (combined use of only around 16 months admittedly) there is one month of above 3 GB usage (holiday when home broadband was out of action). And yet unlimited data is enough of an issue to leave. The initiatives listed are *not* peace of mind inducing at all. Knowing you're going to run out (or have done!) of data doesn't particularly help if you can't afford another goodybag and need the data. The most obvious solution is clearly better throttling if that's what you're after. 

Furthermore, if flexibility really is the aim, simply add reasonably priced separate sections (eg like gigabits, but not as poorly priced), so people can ignore the minutes and texts they won't use, for a cheaper price. I can't see that being anything other than popular.

The other thing that bugs me is the approach that seems to have been taken here. Option 3 is clearly ridiculous (as seen by the fact nobody even mentions it in the community thread). Why was it even mooted? Option 2 appears to be better value than similar options from other providers, but also alienates the market attracted by the major selling point in the past. It just has the feel of option 1 being the only viable one (or rather, closest to viable), and the consultation an attempt to make customers feel like they're involved in making a decision which has already been made. 

I admit, the idea is not totally bereft of positives (getting rid of used up goodybags seems sensible, if not required under any other proposal, and allowing tethering on limited data is handy), but £20 for unlimited internet is just way, way too much.

A friend of mine had some personal problems this past academic year and decided it would be best to defer the year. He has requested to be transferred into a university in his hometown and they accepted however, the university does not allow people to transfer straight into 3rd year thus making him repeat second year. Since he has already been funded 3 years (decided to defer mid third year) and now has to study for 2 more years, student finance has said they can only fund one more year (therefore funding 4 years of study). 
Now the weird thing is that they have told him they won't fund this year (second year repeat) but will fund the one after (third year). This puts him in a shitty situation because he cannot afford to pay for the year (especially now the prices have gone up and are now affecting him). My question is why cant they fund this year allowing him to work and save up to make paying for next year easier? 

They have told him to appeal but everytime I ask him about it he says he's still heard nothing and it's getting closer and closer to september.

Transfer fees are one-time lump sums, occasionally they're over a set number of months or years. Wages, on the other hand are paid every week.

Champion's League football is the real culprit here; Arsenal are earning around 20 million more pounds a year from making it to the Champs League group stages, which means they have all that extra money to help pay higher wages. Lump sums can be made up easily over time; wages and other consistent outlays have to be counted consistently by your income.

This is what Bayern does. I dont know why you take that away from Bayern and praise Dortmund for it.

I know that almost everyone believes Dortmund makes a lot of smart transfers, only young players, produces stars and Bayern is the vilain that poaches the league.

But that is total nonsense.


&gt;a club that buys smart, young


We dont even need to talk about a free Lewi. Reina for 3m€ is awesome.  10m€ for Bernat is not a lot and if he wont be a starter he is a way better backup than Contento.

Rode and Kirchoff (last season) for free is great. They are young talented german players and very good transfers. Bayern always tries to get young talented german players. They always did. I ll talk about the german squad later.

Thiago for 25m€ last season was a ridiculous steal. Götze for 37m€ is awesome. Both young, insanely gifted players and very low fees.


40m€ for Martinez was a huge fee, but without him Bayern wouldnt have won the CL. He was insane in his first season. He was injured for a long time last season and played great when he was fit again. Expensive but totally worth it. 

Dante for 5m€? Very very good transfer. His performance in the CL winning season made the transfer worth it and his performance last season was way better than most people think.

Mandzukic for 13m€. He did a great job for 2 seasons, very important in the CL winning season and they sold him with profit. Smart transfer.

Shaqiri for 12m€ is great aswell. He didnt perform very good but some clubs wanted to buy him for way more money. Not the best transfer (yet) but he is still young and no one doubts taht he is talented.

Boateng for 14m€ was very good.

28m€ for Neuer? Insane!

So Bayern always makes very smart transfers.

Dortmund makes smart transfers aswell, no doubt, but Bayerns transfers are anything else but not smart.


&gt;and produces stars.

My favorite part tbh

Take a look at the WC winning squad of Germany. 

Lahm, Schweinsteiger, Kroos and Müller are from Bayerns youth and without a doubt top top top worldclass players.


Guess how many Dortmund players played at the WC. And how many of those are from Bayerns youth. Yup, Hummels.

Neuer and especially Boateng made a huge step forward in the last few years at Bayern.

Where are all those Stars Dortmund produced?

They produced Götze, Schmelzer and Sahin.

Bayern got those mentioned above Badstuber and Alaba.

Sahin and Schmelzer are definitely not world class.

Reus? Dortmund bought him at the age of 23. If you say Dortmund formed Reus you could say the same about Bayern when they bought Ribery at the age of 24, Boateng, Thiago, Martinez.


Subotic, Bender, Gündogan, Błaszczykowski, Großkreutz?

Bought. Or poaching (how it is called when Bayern does it)

Poaching?

Wait what?

Dortmund got 7 players from their youth in the first squad (source transfermarkt.de)

Bayern got 9.

From other german clubs

Dortmund 13 Piszczek, Weidenfeller, Großkreutz, Ji were free

Bayern 7. Rode, Lewi, Pizarro and Starke were free.

I wont call you a liar, because almost everyone keeps repeating the same nonsense.

But honestly, it is ridiculous.

Simply allow people to continue on the current level of income, and as other people have pointed out, this will still incentivise people to look for work if they want more than the basic income.

It will also push up wages for unpopular jobs as living on basic job seekers would be preferable for a lot of people to cleaning shit from sewers all day.

If you want a living wage, you get a job. If you want more money, do a job that nobody else wants. If you don't want to work then you get your basic income.

I would also do some changes to the system of basic income in that I would actually lower the amount of physical cash given to recipients, yet pay all of their utility bills automatically (up to a point*).

*There would have to be limits to the amount of payments made for things like electricity, water, etc, to prevent abuse. But a collective bargaining power of a government should be able to lower overall prices from utility companies to negate any abuse.

Pay all utilities, pay rent and housing benefit, etc. But lower the amount the recipient can get in cash.

Why? Because if you ever want to see this pass by vote, you're going to need to show to the voters that you're not just giving a blank check to addicts of all tastes. Smokers, drinkers, other drug users. That's all you're going to hear from the opposition. And that's what's going to kill it getting passed.

You need to show you are still pushing work as a valuable contribution to the country, and that living on the basic income should be a safety net, and not a desirable way of living in the long term. If you want to smoke, drink, or buy other drugs, get a job and pay for it with your own money.

If you're implementing all the suggestions I mentioned above, the current level of JSA (16-24 = £57.35/25 or over = £72.40) would need to be cut to balance it out. If all of your basic bills are being covered by the government, you don't need the full amount of JSA. And I think that lowering the physical cash amount to the lowest possible figure and giving the money via other benefits such as electricity payments, etc, would be the easiest thing for the most people to swallow because they don't care about the detailed explanation of benefits, they only see the physical amount the person gets.

As an example of this, ask someone how much a person on JSA actually gets in benefits? There are very few identical amounts, because housing and council tax benefits change from person to person. But you don't often see those figures cited whenever these articles show up in the papers because not many people care about them, because those are payments that the job seekers don't get to keep for themselves.

The lower the physical cash figure, the more people would vote for it. That's the key.",0,1407705334,null,0,false,0,cjmibt3,t3_2d5mug,t1_cjmibt3,t1_cjmejvb,null,1435171595,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

It started off absolutely horrendous and slowly got better. It's been a bit of a shit year in the main, so I've had a lot to deal with, and this week things really hit rock bottom. Thank god for anxiety pills. They are at least helping me to try to attempt to deal with these things to an extent (which are now emergencies, two of the fuckers at once), so I'm slowly getting there. I don't remember when I turned from a normal, functioning person into such a fucking pussy and tbh it grates on me that I have to be on medication, but it is what it is. At least this lot of pills haven't given me a nasty skin reaction nor nearly sent me to A&amp;E (though I think that was probably a food thing). 

&gt;and I feel so much more productive now

Oh, productivity. I remember that! Uh... well, I have some washing on and I put my face on today, so that's a start, right? I also did my nails yesterday morning when I realised at 32 hours of no sleep that there was bugger all point in trying. So my nails look nice :)

&gt;Looked into access courses so I could potentially be moving away within a year to study stuff &amp; get much back on track, but also applied for quite a few jobs.

What is an 'access' course please?

&gt;Only real disappointment of the week is a job which would have been really good for me, and suitable with regards to fitting around the hours I'll hopefully be studying was unfortunately filled by the time I saw it and was able to enquire.

Was it the one you told me about? Sadface if so. 

&gt;Now you lot go!

I'm having an indie-off with mates on Facebook. Turns out that /u/samson-strange knows one of my IRL friends from 10 years ago - small world. Hopefully we can arrange a piss-up for the three of us. 

Some good things:

- Some of my mates are incredible

- I'm still not fat, despite almost having an appetite again

- There is wine and good music

- Things can really only get better

But what doesn't sit well with me about Bayern is, if you think about the 12-13 season where Dortmund and Bayern were so competitive, who were Dortmund's best players? Götze and Lewa (arguably). Where are they now? At their rivals, Bayern. There is just something really wrong about that for me. It's like Suarez and Gerrard signing for Manchester United after last season. Is the rivalry as fierce anymore? I don't think so... Bayern murdered the Bundesliga last season and Dortmund were in the dust. Ultimately I believe Bayern sucked the life out of Dortmund with the Götze transfer and I just don't really like it.

Is it Bayern's fault? Are Bayern wrong? Probably not. Does it make me dislike Bayern, to be honest, yes. Does it make the Bundesliga less entertaining that Dortmund are not as strong as they were, for me, yes.

I'll grant you that.  Dancing is good, makes me feel validated (the girl chooses to dance with me) and feels like the girl and I are giving each other our attention.  It can sometimes get quite close and intimate, also gives you that crucial opportunity to touch her hands which is a sign of male attraction.

Always.

He's never been someone to regularly harass an opposition player in possession, or track an opponent's run, or break his neck to get back and stop a counter attack - never.

He's always tried to shirk these responsibilities.

Even under Mancini.

That's why Mancini so often played him in the hole with De Jong and Barry as a defensive pairing behind him - precisely so his lack of a defensive contribution wouldn't hurt us so much.

When Mancini did play him paired with Barry in a deep centre mid pair it was in a 4231, and his role was more reserved and more disciplined than it is now.

But in a central midfield pair in a 442, much more is required of that pair pressing wise, especially if a team plays the high line that we do.

And it will always be a major weakness of this side to have a passenger in such a key position when we're out of possession, regardless of how talented that passenger is.

If we see today's kind of performances from Yaya more regularly then there's a significant case to drop him. Hopefully that won't happen though, and he'll maintain the form he did last season.

Either way the flaws to his game will always be there, the more pertinent question now is his commitment to this club.",0,1407707299,null,0,false,0,cjmj93u,t3_2d5jjc,t1_cjmj93u,t1_cjmdh7e,null,1435172030,7,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,7

The players that will shine are Enner Valencia I'm expecting 14-15 goals from him, Aaron Cresswell and Matt Jarvis, I think those two down the left will be amazing if pre-season is anything to go by.

Once Allardyce has been given the long awaited boot, the player that will shine is Elliot Lee, he's been good enough for the last 2 years now and once someone comes in that wants to actually give youth players a go, he will have his chances, and believe me, he will take them!

**Some other predictions for the season:**

* Andy Carroll will score 1 goal all season.
* Kevin Nolan won't be able to play a game because he's got a hangover.
* BFS will do a pre match interview without realising he has spilt Ketchup on his tie.
* Zarate's primary position will be on the wing.
* Allardyce will have a pop at the fans when things start going wrong for him.
* Sir Paolo Di Canio will come out of the tunnel at the next home game and square up to BFS, poke in in his eye and kick him in the bollocks, get a microphone and lead a chorus of I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles.
* Reid will be sold in the January window.
* **WE WILL DO THE DIRTY TOTTENHAM CUNTS TWICE AGAIN!!**

GPs are essentially small business owners who contract their services to the NHS - they're not NHS employees. So as well as providing medical services they also have to run the business - employing secretaries/nurses/receptionists/managers etc. They pay for their own buildings and are responsible for the bills/insurance etc. They are now responsible through the CCGs for commissioning and paying for hospital services. 

They also have to pay both their own pension contributions AND the employers pension contribution. So out of that 100k headline, 50k goes in taxes, 10k goes in pension contributions and another 15k or so goes in employer contributions. 

It would cost you more to take out vet insurance for a cat than your GP gets paid for unrestricted visits to the practice.

So you would say that Bayern doesn't frequently buy players who are already established as great players? Martinez, Gotze, Lewandowski, Reina, Robben, Ribery, Rafinha, Pizarro, and Neuer are all players that were already established as being top players before they moved to Bayern. Bayern does also have an excellent core of players that they bought very young or produced in their academy--Lahm, Schwensteiger, Badstuber, Alaba and Muller--but they've supplemented their squad with star players that they had no hand in developing. There is no shame in this--it's just a reason why some would prefer BVB to Bayern.

BVB, on the other hand, has a host of players who didn't play in one of the top 4 leagues in Europe before they bought them. Dortmund tends to buy players who are rough and develop them. Bayern, though they do well in the transfer market and don't pay the type of money Real or City and Chelsea do, over the last few season, they have bought a number of players who are already stars. I'm not sure where you're getting your numbers for players in each side's starting XI that they developed, but I have 5 in Bayern's from last year (Boateng, Alaba, Lahm, Muller, Kroos) and 7 in BVB's (Weidenfeller, Hummels, Grosskreutz, Schmelzer, Sven Bender, Sahin and Lewandowksi). And, while you point out that Bayern's players are better--and I wouldn't argue with that, and I doubt anyone would--most clubs in the world would be quite happy to have any of the above listed players of Dortmund's. I know there are a few on BVB that I'd gladly welcome at Liverpool.

Bayern do buy smart in a lot of instances, but not in the same way as Dortmund. Buying ""smart"" when you are spending tens of millions on players is not difficult. In this vein, Man City and Chelsea also buy smart, in that their players often end up being seen as successes. The difficult transfers are the sub £20 million transfers. BVB does a good job of buying players before they show that they are good enough in a top league, and then developing them into great players.

I'm not sure why this even offends you so much? I'd love for Liverpool to take a core of 4 or 5 guys that they produced from their academy and supplement them with established, top players. Liverpool has even bought 3 players from Southampton, a club known for producing good players, this very window.

true,Mynameisaw,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"&gt;1) how do you pay for it? 

This is difficult to answer without exact figures but lets make a few assumptions. 

1. There are roughly 55million people over the age of 18 at present.

2. The UK spends roughly 160bn on the welfare state including pensions not including disability. 

3. Theres approximately 30 million income tax payers in the UK.

So by removing the welfare state and the tax threshold you free up some 220 billion. 

If you set certain conditions for eligiblity. For example, if you have a total estate value exceeding 1 million then your payments are frozen until you drop below that level. Or if you have a personal income exceeding 100,000 a year then your payments are reduced until theres no discrepency from earning 93 to 99k as opposed to earning 100k. (I.e. someone on 93k actually has an income of 101k.)

Under these assumptions and with fine tuning you could reduce the eligibility pool to approximately 40bn.

With payments of £7000 a year your expense would be approximately 210bn.

&gt;2) is it better for the economy on a simple opportunity cost? 

It's impossible to say. It depends entirely on how the majority of the money is used. Without a prior example to analyse then it's a purely hypothetical theory.

I would like to think it would be a benefit due to it being used creatively and productively by those employed and would give the poor a safety net allowing them to spend more and even enable them to use collective spending to lift themselves out of poverty. 

&gt;3) is it better for the poorest on a simple opportunity cost.

Well if you consider a household of 3 over 18s would have a household income of 24k then I'd say it's definitely better as it would lift the requirement to be employed to live a reasonably comfortable life, if you want independence then you need a job but families would still be able to support each other.

It's all hypothetical and until it's tried it can't be said to work either way, but I like to think it's a plausible idea and not to idealistic. ",0,1407709512,null,0,false,0,cjmk8lb,t3_2d5mug,t1_cjmk8lb,t1_cjmh9z7,null,1435172494,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

true,IbnReddit,null,null,"I think the [following comment](http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/39274790) from the same article deserves a mention here:

You've got to sympathise to an extent with Salmond's problem: that when it comes to currency for an independent Scotland, there really is no good option. Recent experience in the eurozone has already demonstrated that currency union without political union is unworkable, and that's why the UK government has taken it off the table. Similarly no-one is seriously suggesting the euro, once the SNP's favoured option, as a desirable or realistic option. You hear some people suggest a separate Scottish currency, which would at least permit control over monetary and fiscal policy.

But let me break down the reasons a Scottish currency isn't being discussed seriously:

The first thing you have to understand is that an independent Scotland wants trade and investment. In particular, it wants to attract foreign investment in Scottish industry and to export more than it imports. Potential investors and buyers of Scottish exports are put off by two things: expense and risk.
If a currency is strong, that means Scottish products are more expensive to import and investment is more expensive; if it is weak, they are cheaper. If a currency is volatile, this makes investment and trade more risky. There are several reasons to suppose that a freely floating Scottish currency would be both excessively strong and particularly volatile:

One is that new currencies are always relatively volatile.

The other is oil. The demand for a country's currency is derived from the demand for the goods and services that country sells, and by the attractiveness of investment opportunities there. The exchange rates of the currencies of small countries in which exports of natural resources (usually oil) dominate the balance of payments, as Scotland would be, closely match changes in the demand for that export. These are sometimes known as petrocurrencies.

Because of the demand for oil, a Scottish currency would be very strong. This would be bad news for exporters, e.g. of agricultural produce and whisky, whose products would be much more expensive abroad as a result. Investment would also suffer for the same reason. This phenomenon is known as Dutch disease after the stagnation of Dutch industry following the discovery of natural gas there.

Also because of the demand for oil, a Scottish currency would be volatile. This is because the price of oil itself is very volatile.

The currencies of large countries, like the UK, are not as susceptible to these problems. The demand for oil, significant as it may be, doesn't affect the strength of sterling nearly as much as it would a Scottish currency. Neither does the volatility of oil prices affect the stability of sterling nearly as much, in part (again) because demand for oil is a much smaller component of overall demand, and partly because the risks are partly diversified away against a much larger and more diverse industrial base.

The option of pegging a Scottish currency to the pound (or euro, etc.) isn't attractive either. The volatility of oil revenues could force the Scottish government/central bank to intervene, for which massive currency reserves would be required. An independent Scotland would not be able to defend the peg against speculators for long.
Think of the recurring balance of payments crises under the Bretton Woods system, the 1997/1998 financial crises in Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia (and others to a lesser degree) and the eurozone crises in Greece, Spain, Italy, Ireland and Spain: all in small to medium economies which tried to maintain a currency peg or currency unions without political union.

A currency peg or currency union without political union would, sooner or later, lead to a Scottish financial crisis, and before long, an austerity programme would be imposed by the UK, the IMF, or both, as in Greece's Troika of the IMF, the European Commission and the ECB.

It seems therefore, that an independent Scotland would end up sliding into the unsatisfactory Sterlingisation option, in which the Bank of England would set monetary policy without regard for Scotland's macroeconomic situation. There's a deep irony to the Sterlingisation option too, that hasn't been picked up on yet: that the Scottish commercial banks, currently permitted to issue their own distinctively Scottish banknotes, would surely lose that privilege, so that a newly independent Scotland would likely see Robert the Bruce, Sir Walter Scott, Robert Burns and the rest disappear from its banknotes.",0,1407709678,null,0,false,0,cjmkb7v,t3_2d6h9c,t1_cjmkb7v,t3_2d6h9c,null,1435172529,113,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,113

I didn't say use the profit margins, that currently are not in the governments hand, so can be considered new income, to replace already existing expenses. I said to use that new income that would now be the governments to reduce ticket costs.

&gt;Yet you propose lowering ticket costs (maybe to 0?) and also investing more to get more people using the railways?

No. I proposed using it to reduce ticket costs. And pointed out that by working it in to the budget ticket fares could be reduced to 0.

&gt;Your magical railways sounds perfectly nice but it isn't remotely practical to lower ticket prices and also invest more.

It is practical to use new income that doesn't currently exist to reduce the price of what created the income.

How are you not getting this? I never stated it was a massive a reduction. Just that it could be used to ease the currently inflated price of tickets.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;So you would say that Bayern doesn't frequently buy players who are already established as great players?

No, no. Of course Bayern does it, but everyone does it. Everyone tries to get the best players. So how can you blame Bayern? It would be the same as someone who eats a steak says ""Hey you over there, you should stop eating animals""

And I understand that you dislike Bayern for buying one of your players, but everyone rants about Bayern doing it while every single club does it every season.


Do you think Gladbach fans were happy about Dortmund buying Reus, their best players, Hertha fans werent happy because Dortmund bought Ramos (their best player), ...

The list goes on. Bayern does it, Dortmund does it, everyone does it. But as we saw, people dont care if some clubs do it but rant about other clubs.

&gt; they have bought a number of players who are already stars

Dortmund does the same. Bayern buys young talents and top stars. Why should they buy weaker players if they get the best for a good money? You cant blame Bayern for doing the best for the club if others are willing to sell players or give them clauses. Everyone wants to sign the best players they can get.


&gt; I'm not sure where you're getting your numbers for players in each side's starting XI that they developed


&gt;Weidenfeller, Hummels, Grosskreutz, Schmelzer, Sven Bender, Sahin and Lewandowksi

You think Dortmund developed those players?

It depends how you define 'develop'. 

If you want to say you developed a player you have to take him from your youth to your main squad, IMO.

The only world class player that came from Dortmunds youth to Dortmunds main squad was Götze.

Weidenfeller, Hummels, Grosskreutz, Sven Bender, Lewandowski came from other clubs' main squads. 

&gt;And, while you point out that Bayern's players are better-

I didnt want to insult a player, but the general opinion seems to be that Großkreutz and Schmelzer are worldclass players Dortmund developed.

Großkreutz came from Rot Weiss Ahlens main squad, so you could argue about him being developed from Dortmund, but the word 'worldclass' loses every meaning if someone claims Großkreutz and Schmelzer are worldclass.

&gt;Buying ""smart"" when you are spending tens of millions on players is not difficult

An expensive player underperforming is worse than a cheap one. If 40m€ Martinez would have underperformed it would be a terrible thing. But Dortmunds 300k€ player underperforming doesnt matter.

&gt;BVB does a good job of buying players before they show that they are good enough in a top league, and then developing them into great players.

And Bayern develops more world class players through their youth system.


Dortmunds worldclass players are/were Götze, Lewi, Hummels, Gündogan and Reus. The rest wouldnt play a lot at most top clubs.

Hummels came from Bayern, Reus was Gladbachs key player, Robert Lewandowski shot loads of goals in the polish league and I think we can say his 32 goals in 58 matches were very important for Lech Posen. Gündogan was Nürnbergs biggest hope and important starter before Dortmund bought him.

Wheres the difference between giving 16 year old kids the arguably best youth system in germany or buying a lot of young players which are starters for several clubs?




&gt;I'm not sure why this even offends you so much?

It offends me because people keep repeating lies and act like Bayern is a vilain that wants to destroy Dortmund because they do the same as every other club.

true,Ezterhazy,null,null,"&gt;The sale of Kendall prompted outrage, it would be like Barkley going to anybody right now.

I think that's a poor analogy. Barkley is a young, local Evertonian with bags of potential and everything to prove. Howard Kendall was older, having been bought from Preston seven years earlier, and had proved himself as part of Everton's most famous midfield. There's no real analogy to be found in our squad to compare to selling him. It'd be like selling James McCarthy in 2019 having won the league next season. 

&gt;Kendall eventually became a player manager at Stoke City.

Blackburn, not Stoke. He might have coached at Stoke but he wasn't manager.

I think it should be emphasised how close we were to winning the league in the 1970s, and how good Bob Latchford was in that time. He was the first player in years to get 30 goals in the top flight in 1978, and we were 3 points off winning the league in 1975 after being top for the whole season. There's also the infamous Clive Thomas FA Cup semi-final which I'm sure no-one here wants to talk about or remember.

I had done a lot of programming as a hobby, and that is what I chose as a career. I've used maths and physics in my job, very handy to be able to tackle things that many programmers run a mile from. But there was no way I was going to be a research physicist.

true,KaiserMacCleg,,,"Outdoorsy stuff:

* **[Brecon Beacons National Park](http://www.breconbeacons.org/)** for hiking. **[Pen-y-Fan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_y_Fan)** is the highest mountain in South Wales and is piss easy to summit if you approach from the south. Climb its northern slopes if you fancy more of a real hike.
* **[Waterfall Country](http://www.visitwales.com/things-to-do/activities/walking-hiking/waterfall-country)** for more sheltered woodland walks. Loads of waterfalls, as you might expect, including [one which you can walk behind](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=sgwd+yr+eira&amp;safe=off&amp;rlz=1C1GIGM_enGB532GB532&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K_znU5r_GqLQ7AbEiYCADg&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=813).
* The **[Glamorgan Heritage Coast](http://www.valeofglamorgan.gov.uk/en/enjoying/visit_the_vale/llantwit_major_and_coast/heritage_coast.aspx)** and the **[Gower Peninsula](http://www.enjoygower.com/index.cfm)** are the best places to head for coastal walks. Some particularly beautiful spots include Dunraven Bay in Glamorgan and Three Cliffs Bay and Rhossili on the Gower.

Historical stuff:

* The best castles in the area IMO are, in no particular order, **[Caerphilly Castle](http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/caerphilly-castle/?lang=en)** (second largest castle in Britain), **[Castell Coch](http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/castell-coch/?lang=en)** (a Victorian fantasy), **[Cardiff Castle](http://www.cardiffcastle.com/)** (a Victorian mansion and Norman keep within the rebuilt walls of a Roman fortress), **[Castell Carreg Cennen](http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/Carreg-cennen-castle/?lang=en)** (an imposing hilltop fortress of mixed Cambro-Norman heritage) and **[Chepstow Castle](http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/chepstow-castle/?lang=en)** (a clifftop border fortress overlooking the River Wye).
* The **[National History Museum](https://www.museumwales.ac.uk/stfagans/)** at St. Fagans outside Cardiff is probably one of the most visited places in Wales. Includes a massive open-air museum containing dozens of structures of all ages that were taken down from their original locations and reconstructed stone by stone within the museum.
* **[Big Pit](https://www.museumwales.ac.uk/bigpit/)** for that not-quite-authentic coal mine experience. 
* **[Caerleon](https://www.museumwales.ac.uk/roman/)** and **[Caerwent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caerwent)** for all things Roman.
* **[Tintern Abbey](http://cadw.wales.gov.uk/daysout/tinternabbey/?lang=en)** for a spot of ecclesiastical reflection. The Abbey is within the **[Wye Valley](http://www.wyevalleyaonb.org.uk/)** on the border with England, another area that's well known for its natural beauty.

Towns and cities worth visiting:

* **Cardiff**, obviously. In addition to its many castles and the National History Museum, it also plays host to the [National Museum](https://www.museumwales.ac.uk/cardiff/https://www.museumwales.ac.uk/cardiff/) (period), the [Dr. Who Experience](http://www.doctorwho.tv/events/doctor-who-experience/) (if that's your sort of thing), and quite a good shopping centre.
* **Hay-on-Wye** (in Powys) is a charming little border town chock full of bookshops, most of which are full of ancient stock that regular bookshops wouldn't dare put on their shelves. Hosts a literature festival every spring. One of the most characterful places in Wales, without a doubt.
* **Brecon** (also in Powys) is another beautiful place that has a certain Georgian grandeur that belies its small size. Not an awful lot there, though it does have a couple of small museums and a parish church that calls itself a cathedral. Also hosts a jazz festival, though unfortunately that's just finished. Still a very pleasant place to pass a couple of hours.

I don't think much of Merthyr itself, unfortunately. It's an ugly duckling to say the least, and consequentially I haven't spent much time there. There are a couple of sights which spring to mind which may be worth visiting, though: **[Cyfarthfa Castle](http://www.visitmerthyr.co.uk/attractions/cyfarthfa-park-museum/cyfarthfa-castle-museum.aspx)** and the **[Brecon Mountain Railway](http://www.breconmountainrailway.co.uk/)**.",0,1407714357,null,0,false,0,cjmmbo1,t3_2d5yx3,t1_cjmmbo1,t3_2d5yx3,null,1435173477,7,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,7

His average games/goal ratio is almost 3. If you apply it to the prem then he'd get 13 goals in a season. Decent sure, but as a first choice striker in a title-chasing team? Abysmal. He had one fantastic season last year. Sure. But I just don't see him succeeding here. He needs time on the ball, he needs to be able to bully defenders with his strength. And he can't.

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"20 years ago it was Braveheart - and yes for the younger Redditors the SNP were riding on a wave of actual real Nationalism and crowing on about it. Yes really, despite how much they distance themselves now.

That changed and Salmond has turned them away from overt nationalism.

They kept on about magic oil money - that's been going since the 70s.

They then seized on the what is the only, in my view, credible and reasonable reason for independence - to determine our own future and become an EU state. To stop being the sidekick in a two-man-show to being in the chorus.

I don't buy that reason but I understand that many people do and it's fine by me.

The SNP ran into problems because many of their potential supporters won't put their hand in their pocket to pay for it - perfectly reasonable. Also they've found that they just don't have enough support, even if it wasn't for the economic worries.

So the SNP realising they cannot win on the platform they were trying have turned to a campaign which is pretty much based on being anti-Westminster.

To me that's shortsighted - let's not base our future as a nation on a petulant fit because we don't like the current government.

The SNP could not win with their previous tactics, so they tried new ones. They've not worked either.... 

Expect new tactics coming as they try more risky things. They probably won't work... but then again if they don't change tactic it's inevitable that separatism will fail.

University does not just mean that you are smart. It also means that you can stick with a three year long university degree in the relevant subject without giving up. By getting it you prove you were able to get it. By not getting it, you signify you could not get it.

You know the successful people who are university drop outs? They are dropouts because their plan was better than their status quo and they were just wasting their lives at university. The people who did well without going to uni? The exact same.

You aren't entitled to an easy, cushy, well paid job that you are interested in. If it were that easy, other people more knowledgeable than you would already be doing it. Because the people you are competing with are the ones who knew from early on they weren't getting a degree and have been focused on nothing more than getting this job. They have researched it, they care about it, they have thought about it. They deserve it more.

It just might be that university isn't for you. But if that is the case, your life is going to be a lot harder, the overwhelming majority of your aspirations are going to be more and more difficult to achieve.

&gt;__Digital Rights Management__ (__DRM__) is a class of technologies  that are used by hardware manufacturers, publishers, [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright) holders, and individuals with the intent to control the use of digital content and devices after sale;    there are, however, many competing definitions.  With first-generation DRM software, the intent is to control copying; with second-generation DRM, the intent is to control executing, viewing, copying, printing and altering of works or devices. The term is also sometimes referred to as *[copy protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_protection)*, *copy prevention*, and *copy control*, although the correctness of doing so is disputed.  DRM is a set of [access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control) technologies.   DRM is used by many companies, including [Amazon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com), [AT&amp;T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T), [AOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL), [Apple Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.), [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google),  [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC), [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft), [Electronic Arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts), [Sony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony), and [Valve Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Corporation) use digital rights management. In 1998, the [Digital Millennium Copyright Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) (DMCA) was passed in the United States to impose criminal penalties on those who make available technologies whose primary purpose and function are to circumvent content protection technologies.

Realise the world isn't the candyland you were promised in school. 

As Thetonn said university really isn't about being smart. It's about proving you can stick something out for 3 or 4 years - that's all.

It sounds as if you can't stick it out. My prediction is you'll try something else drop that too and end up like the majority of the population stuck in a job you hate earning too little with little prospect of change.

Stop deluding yourself. The world is not your oyster, you've been lied to. 

The idea of picking a career that meets your hobbies is a pipe dream.

Sorry - I'm not trying to be nasty but the worst thing anyone can do is tell you to shoot for the stars - if you miss, which most do, you'll be in the cold emptiness of space.

Edit : I've just read this and it's harsh.. I don't want to be too harsh, the world actually isn't the shithole I'm making out. I'm quite happy.

Honestly though, I don't know who we could buy to put there that would be an improvement. The only person I would want to play over those two is David Alaba and he is unbuyable. 

Also, we lack a true left winger or wide midfielder to play opposite Navas. Milner is good but he is better on the right. Silva and Nasri are both best playing in the middle and will drift all over the place and make the formation lopsided if you play them out wide. Nasri is better than Silva at staying wide but lacks the dynamism of Silva. If we were to buy someone to work in there it would be expensive. I would say Reus would be my pick if I was a picker but he is too expensive.

It's not about emotions or hate, it's just a basic fact. See also - not controlling your own foreign and defence policy by continuing to keep the British armed forces intact. 

If you were to continue to use Sterling or to switch to the Euro then you would have a default monetary union with either the UK or the Euro-zone which would mean  you would either have to accept a political union to manage that or you would have to accept loss of any ability to control the macro-economic policy which you would be subject to.

I spent the day in the quiet little artist town of Beacon, NY and passed a restaurant called ""Pandorica"" as I walked down the main street. I smiled to myself but didn't think much of it. On the way back, I looked inside and saw the giant mural of the exploding TARDIS. Of course, I then ran in and started talking to the owner (dressed head to toe in TARDIS blue). She took me around the entire restaurant pointing out every tiny detail, from the sunflowers on the tables to the ""fish fingers"" (aka french toast sticks) and custard on the dessert menu. I told her that I'll be moving to London this autumn (the mecca, really) and she replied that she's actually from there. It made a lot of sense seeing how much British influence is in the food--they do an afternoon tea that looks lovely.

Quite a few benefits to this:

1. You eliminate the poverty trap, where the unemployed have little incentive to work because the gains from working are dwarfed by the loss in benefit income.

2. You effectively eliminate the need for inefficient welfare bureaucracy. No longer do you have to tell the DOLE officer how many people you live with, which jobs you've applied for, etc. ADDED BONUS: you don't have to apply to obviously fake jobs which are obviously only advertised so they can steal your data.

3. You eliminate the stigma attached to receiving welfare. This means no longer do you have the problem of people living in poverty because they're too proud to claim.

4. Massively reduces the need for a minimum wage, meaning that we can have the benefits of people having enough money to live on, without the cost of increases unemployment/underemployment from the minimum wage.

5. Benefits paid directly to the individual rather than too a landlord or on food stamps are used more efficiently. People know how to spend their money better than any government official does.

I think everybody agrees that Naughton is terrible at left back. I'm not even really considering that when I rate him. After that, it looks like he played about 10 games or so in a row while Walker was out to finish out the season.

In those 10 games, Naughton was a part of the 4-0 embarrassment against Chelsea, the 4-0 loss to Liverpool, and almost single handedly cost us the game against Southampton. After that, it looks like he had about 5 pretty good games in a row. I would call that a stretch of good games. Call me crazy, but 5 games is not enough to make up for the horror performance at Soton or the two terrible defeats at Chelsea and Liverpool. I do not rate Naughton as a backup and as far as I'm concerned, he is a pretty poor player. 5 games doesn't change that. He'll have to prove more to me and it looks like he'll get a chance to do so.

true,The1KrisRoB,num14,,"I'm not so sure. When people think Dembele the first thing I think that comes to mind is the easy as which he seems to muscle past people, which is amazing. But I think the reason a lot of us are down on Dembele is because once he's gone past his man he often runs down a channel, stops, and then passes back or sideways.

Personally I think he slows down the transition of the ball from back to front far too much. When you combine that with his chronic hip issues, I personally think we should move him on (out of the league if possible) while he still has good resale value.

Don't get me wrong, I think he's a great player, but I just don't think he moves the ball fast enough in the right directions often enough.

As for who would play alongside Capoue in that case... I think Bentaleb is definitely capable, I honestly think Paulinho will come good under Pochettino, and running out Sandro alongside Capoue could quite possibly make opposition players pee themselves a little.

In my experience as an NHS employee,  the NVQ's are worth their weight in gold. Unlike traditional eduction an NVQ is based on your actual knowledge,  of the subject you are studying. The thing is with NVQ's they can be totally customised to the area of work as assessors and institutions can pick their own modules from a list. 

If you look on a lot of jobs these days namely the NHS they will require you to have an NVQ of some form. Also within the NHS moving the NVQ ladder (level 2 to level 3) will also in the most part move you up the pay band and skill band ladder too.  So less of the 'not very qualified'  me ald mukker. 

To add, 

My partner has a masters in psychology, she was turned down for a post in the NHS for NOT meeting the required criteria of Level 2 NVQ...  A GCSE EQUIVALENT! She's now gained her masters and level 2 NVQ, she's now got a few interviews to prep for. 

In short,  an NVQ shows worked knowledge via assessments and evaluation of a subject area, an a level or degree in the most part shows studied skills that may not have yet been applied to the working world.

On the whole, Rodgers has been astute for the most part. Successes like Studge/Coutinho offset most of the signings that haven't panned out right.

Assaidi and Borini if sold for the prices quoted are fanastic business so those can be potentially removed from the list of failed signings. The only signings looking to have failed is Aspas though Borini is more than capable of proving otherwise.

Allen is a good squad player, not a great signing due to his price but not a success either.He could potentially step it up though.

Too early to judge Alberto but it isnt looking good for him currently. Too many players in his position and us signing more in this transfer window shows a lack of faith in his ability.  

Ilori is far too early to be judged as well, I think he is displaying more tallent but we are immensely stacked in his position and it will hamper his development so I am hoping we sell some CBs soon.

However, I don't think a Scottish Currency would ruin Scotland.

Of course it's easy to make it sound like a terrifying prospect for a newly independent country, but if the UK was to edge over to Norway and benevolently offer to take on all their oil money to protect them from it's volatility, I believe there would be a lot of laughs.


And a currency union between Scotland and the UK would be nothing like the Euro, successful currency unions such as between the low countries have worked very well thanks to their similarity, the danger only comes when admitting much less developed economies such as with Greece (who lied about their status).


But overall I wouldn't be against joining the Euro, I really think it is where the future lies.

Sturridge and Coutinho were ridiculously brilliant signings.

Alberto I like as a player, but I have no idea why he hasn't played.  Same with Ilori.  I suspect neither will be here long term, unfortunately.

Aspas was a gamble that didn't quite pay off.  Not a bad player and seems a great guy, but not cut out for the PL, sadly.

I don't know what to think about Sakho.  Seems good to me, but a bit confused as to whether BR sees a  Skrtel + Lovren as the default pair or not.  If so, it's hard to see his transfer as a success.

Lambert was a great pickup for the price.

Lallana- hasn't played, so no idea.  He was brilliant at Soton, hopefully is equally brilliant for us.

Can I think will be well worth the price paid.  He's just a kid, really, but is clearly quite capable already.

Markovic could go either way.  He clearly has natural ability, whether or not he can apply that is very much TBD.  I think he'll either be world class or fade away into obscurity.

Origi, no clue.

Lovren was a brilliant signing.  Wish we had gotten him last summer, to be honest.  I think he'll be the best signing we made this summer this upcoming season.

If you go back to 2012, I find this really frustrating, Nasri was completely quiet during the transfer saga.  

Arsenal was imploding in Aug 2012; they had lost 8-2 to Man U, Fabregas had left, and Nasri was also leaving.

The only thing Nasri did, was that he refused to sign a new contract.  And for that, he drew the ire of Arsenal fans.  They said he was forcing the club to sell him, being selfish, etc etc.  Nevermind the fact that he still sold for 24 or so million.

Think back to the Arsenal Liverpool game, Nasri's last game, where I think he put in a MOTM performance.  He was the only good thing in that Arsenal team and Liverpool completely mocked the London team (it was when Meireliss had his middle-finger saga).  But I distinctly remember it was during that game, when Arsenal fans began that absolutely despicable Nasri chant.

He said something ""controversial"" once; several weeks after the transfer, several weeks after continuous abuse and name calling: City fans are more passionate than Arsenal fans, because the Etihad is louder than the Emirates (or something to that effect).  Which if you ask gunners, or neutrals, they would agree with.  How many times has r/soccer commented on the mausoleum nautre of the Emirates?  It was only last year, due to some success, that the stadium became louder.

People do hate Bayern because they poach players from their competition. People do hate Bayern for being the richest in Germany. And they hate that they inevitably get a lot of the greatest German talent, because not only is it the top German club, it is also the place where a player can get the most money, through both salary from Bayern and from endorsements.

Meaning promises the government has made but hasn't worked out how to pay yet. That's state pensions alone, nothing else! Socialism doesn't work and just because you vote to take people's money and redistribute it, still makes it no different from stealing. 

The answer to our economy isn't more government, it's less. You can shut and moan all you want but all these shiny things they promise you are coming out the pockets of your children.

Fuck, all of these completely loose their power removed from *what* he was saying.

This idea, apparently mostly to give UKIP an out (though given they like appeals to nativism. HMMMM. HMMMM.), that rhetorical 'style' can just be separated from its content is nonsense on stilts.

true,theanonymousthing,logo,,"Ok, ill get things started, do you think we need a Left Winger? or in general more pacey and effective wingers? somebody of Hazards, Di Maria's and Sanchez's quality? In my opinion i think we do, (of course that would be a buy for the future and not these couple of windows).

This is something i've been thinking for ages now and last nights game just showed how effective pacy, technical and true wingers can be especially if they are backed up with a creative midfield.

Arsenal have: Walcott and Sanchez, Ox

Chelsea have: Hazard, Salah, Willian, Schurle 

United have: well really all their wingers where shit last season and that contributed to their failures

Liverpool have: Sterling

Its not about who has what, im just trying to illustrate the point that having proper,technical and fast wingers is acknowledged by the top teams and most as being very effective outlets.

So Hear me out; i think david silva works best in the middle of the pitch where he can dictate the midflied and has more opportunity to distribute the ball. Dont get me wrong he plays great on the left, but hes a make shift LM/LW, he should be playing in the middle where he can maximise his influence.


Our other option that we use on the LW is Nasri, Nasri is obviously a talented player but (heres my unpopular opinion of the day) i think he recycles possession alot and theres not alot of end product. I think that  he also would be best suited playing in a more central role.


I think with pacey wingers we would also be able to maximise Silva's creativity and the penetration of his through balls as sometimes our defence can stagnate a bit.

We have a pacy winger in Jesus Navas, but sometimes i feel he lacks the penetration and physicality that is necessary to get the best out of Silva and often he doesnt stretch the defence enough. James Milner on the other hand has tonnes of penetration and him and silva can be a lethal combination, however Milner lacks the speed and as much as i love JM7 (easily one of my favourite players) he doesn't have enough technical ability.

So if we where going to add to the squad next season/following seasons this would be an area i think would be best.

Who would it be? i dont know

Maybe Lucas Moura or EzequieL Lavezzi from PSG?


Maybe Reus from BvB? (thats a pipe dream i will admit)

Maybe Di Maria? can he play LW?

any suggestions?

He had a book people treated like a holy book that laid out his doctrine. He had an entourage of followers who were at his beck and call and treated him like a king. What other political party then had mass processions, uniforms, it's own paramilitary forces? A cult!

true,BaBaFiCo,null,null,"You've not spoken about having already paid for anything or not needing to pay for stuff, so I'll assume you have it all to pay for. 

Tuition is ~£9,000 per year for UK and EU students which is usually taken in the form of a loan and paid back after you earn over £21,000 at a rate of 9% of your income. International students must pay ~£10,000 per year.

Accommodation in student housing can vary. I paid around £240 a month for a room in a house in Stafford, but in a city you will be paying much more than this. This didn't include bills such as gas, electric, telephone or internet. These can vary depending on how many people to a house and how often you pay. My current home, gas and electric are £97 per month altogether and telephone and internet costs £35 per month. This is then shared between two of us. 

Food is down to you. There are people who can live on £5 a week, some who can't get by on less than £40. After that you have the costs of socialising and extras which again depend on how much you want to do during your time, but bear in mind part of the university experience is meeting new people and having new experiences. 

If you're a British national you're entitles to apply for Student Finance who will loan you money for accommodation and other costs and may even give you some of that as a bursary if you're current home income is below a certain amount. Your chosen university may also have schemes where they loan or gift money to students and this is worth checking on their own website. If you're not a British national, I'm not sure if you're entitled to any financial aid. 

Hope this helps but in my opinion, without financial aid, you don't have enough money. I'd look at either Student Finance or a bank loan to help you. 

Edit: also look into changing your bank account to a 'student account' once you've been accepted at a university. This will give you some form of free overdraft and will also include some perks such as a free rail card for example.

If you're VAT registered and have an office party and you've purchased some of the standard rate (SR) snacks then you can reclaim the VAT that you've already paid in the purchase price.  If you buy zero-rated items (ZR) then you haven't paid any VAT so can't reclaim anything.

Furthermore, if you allow staff to bring their partners to the office party then you can only reclaim the VAT on food for your staff but NOT for their other halves.  So you have to do stupid things like dividing the VAT you've paid by the number of people at the party divided by the number of non-employees present, then take away the first number you thought of, and so on.

All to reclaim 36p of VAT.

-Our best transfer:   Fernando (even if Mangala comes in) because he is a true holding mid (Fernandinho roams box to box while 'nando hangs around the center circle). This will allow Yaya to play more of a CAM role which usually brings us success.

-Weakest position right now:   CB but Mangala should be coming in to shore that up. After that, I'd have to say the wingers (Navas/Milner, not Silva/Nasri who often get deployed on the flanks &amp; roam in central). Navas hasn't hit his stride yet, so I won't criticize too much, but often in the preseason he looked like he was lacking pace and couldn't beat a LB 1v1. He should be able to take on most LBs with pure speed alone  or a simple 1-2 passing move with a teammate.

-Most looking forward to:   The UCL campaign considering our poor showings in recent years. Hopefully this time we'll stay out of the group of death. Also looking forward to starting the BPL season MUCH stronger...last season we were slow out of the gates (only matters where you finish though, I suppose).

-Most worried about:   Group of Death and United having any success at all

------------------Joe-----------------

Zaba---Kompany---Demi---Kolarov

Nasri----F'dinho----Yaya-----Silva

----------Jovetic---Aguero---------


I really don't believe there ought to be any question of who starts in goal, although Pellegrini may just be trying to keep Hart motivated.

Demichelis is still our 2nd best option at CB until Mangala is signed/integrated to the team, none of our younger defenders have looked up to displacing him and he's been in decent form.

I think we can mostly agree that Zaba/kolarov are better options for us than Sagna/Clichy (or Richards..), though there are plenty of opportunities for rotation at the fullback positions.

In centre midfield Yaya is a lock, and I believe that 'dinho is a better option than Fernando at this point, as he is proven to fill the holding mid role reliably. On the wings we have several options, but we should be able to agree that Silva is a key piece to our offence. Opposite him, I see Nasri as more consistent than Navas and more creative than milner, and that pairing (basically as two attacking midfielders) has not seemed to make us more vulnerable defensively in the past.

Strong arguments could be made for any of the possible forward pairings. Aguero is locked and loaded for a prolific season if he remains fit, and he should be mostly recovered sometime in the next few weeks. He seems to make whoever he plays alongside much better, notably negredo and dzeko. If he can regain his fitness and form from last fall I rate Negredo as the best option there, as he was absolutely deadly with Aguero a year ago. However I do not see hime being fully fit and recovered in the next 3-4 weeks. One cannot ignore the ascension of Jovetic this offseason; if Pellegrini can get Aguero-Jovetic to work up top, we will have two quick strikers capable of excellent link up play and brilliant finishing. I genuinely believe this could develop into one of the best strike duos in the world this season if they have good chemistry. Dzeko seems not to fit in as always, but I have no doubt we'll find plenty of use for him and he will be important to our season in some way or another.",0,1407742502,null,0,false,0,cjmx042,t3_2d7pk9,t1_cjmx042,t3_2d7pk9,null,1435178631,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

true,lals11,1972crest,,"I agree with you for the most part, but sometimes Silva does struggle in the middle of the park with the physicality of central defenders/mids. I think deploying him on the wing and then letting him naturally roam inside is best (allowing our LB/RB to get up the pitch where they can do damage). &lt;---Getting our fullbacks involved in the attack also somewhat helps to solve the winger issue you brought up (which I also echoed in my original comment).

As far as who to bring in, I think Lucas Moura is a huge pipe dream as well. The transfer fee PSG paid for him was in the 45 mill range and his value will only increase as he moves into the prime of his career. I doubt PSG will be keen to move him, and definitely not at a reduced price (will FFP play a factor...? Possibly).

Di Maria often plays on the right side so he can cut in and shoot lefty...he is ALL left foot, just like Gareth Bale. They'd rather attempt a next-to-impossible outside-of-the-foot bending cross/shot than use their right foot. For that reason alone I'd steer clear of him just because he isn't versatile at all. He has to be played at RW to have success (maybe CAM but we got plenty of guys there already).

Of your suggestions, I wouldn't mind Lavezzi. He seems like a stocky guy who would easily adjust to the physicality of the BPL.

true,JimmothyTwinkletoes,null,null,"I do think we need a winger for the left. We tend to lose width and defences don't have to play out to the wide threats, clogging things up for our strikers. 

Of those options I would go with Reus. He is a beast and would be fit in well with Silva and Navas imo in the midfield. It would keep things balanced in that he can cut inside or stay wide. He is an extremely versatile player too who I think could play on the right, left, or in the middle as a AM or Forward. I think he is Germany's best attacking player and it was a shame for him to be injured this WC. If we were able to land him in the January window I would be extremely excited. He won't go for cheap though. I think he is buyable if we are willing to lose a striker to make room (FFP wise) to pick him up. If we sell Dzeko or Negredo and buy Reus it would only improve the team and fill areas of need.

Lavezzi is too old(29) to spend the money PSG would want for him. He is still a good player though. Lucas could be really good. He should have been on Brazil's squad this World Cup. I haven't seen too much of him to know any more than that he looks good and he is young.

Zabaleta----Kompany----Mangala----Kolarov

With Sagna being a solid back up. An interesting idea might be to play this back line:

I'm looking forward to the UCL too. I think we can go farther if we get out of Groups. Barca was a tough draw but I think we had the talent to beat them if our team was 100% healthy. It was frustrating to see us play so defensively. If we made them play our game we could have won.

I'm not too worried about United because they look like they'll give up a lot of goals. I think smart attacking teams will tear their defense apart. Van Gaal is a great manager though and they will play attractive football but look hideous doing it in those terrible Chevrolet kits.

That’s always undermined the legitimacy of the independence debate. Early polling demonstrated that most people would vote for the option that leaved them better off, even for a few hundred pounds, rather than for political freedom or ideology.

Salmond has done a remarkable job of managing to make lots of popular policy promises, but framing it in a way that lets people believe they will be financially better off at the same time. It’s very strange to see him come unstuck over this one issue, but there doesn’t seem to be an alternative for independence.

Bayern can buy players from everyone within the league, Dortmund, Schalke, Wolfsburg buy players from every club except Bayern.

such statements get posted way too often. It implies that Dortmund does a great job and Bayern throws around money and buys players.

2012: The Jubilee was frowned upon by some for being staged in the midst of a recession, where some arguing that the money being spent on lavish parades could be put to better use elsewhere. As /u/TecTwo mentions, the guy that traditionally makes these remarks is a republican, so would be one of those people.

2013: At the time the coalition planned to privatise substantial percentage of Royal Mail (They've since followed through with this). The quip about the Queens Head comes from a statement made by Thatcher who refused to 'privatise the queens head' when she was selling off other state utilities as PM 
Thatchers remark itself comes from our postage stamps in the UK. Since their introduction they've always featured a portrait of the reigning monarch in some form. 
Random trivia: UK postage stamps are the only postage stamps in the world that do not feature the country name because they were first created here.

2014: The coalition isn't very popular among people from all sides of the political spectrum - Labour and other left-leaning parties dislike because the coalition is conservative-led, and some conservatives themselves are unhappy about being part of a coalition (and the party's perceived softening on some core policies due to this). The coalition is also deeply unpopular among some parts of the electorate due to some unpopular policies introduced - most notably the austerity measures.

If all we care about is making life easier for the police and creating a crime free society, then we should all wear voice recorders that log to a central police computer and all have cameras in our home. But we all know there's more to life than creating a crime free society and facilitating policing.

In the article, the following is cited as justification:

&gt; ""Fahy said police frequently dealt with people struggling to look after themselves, including elderly people, people with dementia or Alzheimer's, those with drug or alcohol problems, those with mental health issues and problem families. Perhaps most controversially, he said medical professionals should share information about women suffering from domestic abuse, even against the victim's wishes.""

With the exception maybe of elderly with Alzheimer's/dementia, this will only harm people's mental health. In cases involving people with drug related (including alcohol), mental health or domestic abuse issues, the knowledge that what they say to their GP is not confidential is more than enough to prevent many people in these categories from seeking immediate help in the first place. This will only lead to bigger health and policing problems later down the road.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"There's a good FAQ on /r/basicincome but I'll have a stab at brief answers:

1. **How do you pay for it?**  
Same way as any other spending program. A combination of other spending cuts, taxation and borrowing. The mix of which shouldn't be a political question (though, it is frequently), ideally you just want a team of government financiers who work out the cheapest way of doing it. (least damaging taxes, least damaging spending cuts, least expensive borrowing)

2. **Is it better for the economy?**  
Well, that depends. The principle justifications for basic income are sound, but what makes the BIG difference is the detail. A basic income of £4,000 per person per year has a very different effect than a basic income of £20,000 per person per year. From what I can tell we don't have any politicians seriously talking about it at this stage, let alone putting forward a serious plan for implementation.  
2b. **Is it better than centralised welfare?**  
Again, it depends on the details. Basic income isn't incompatible with central welfare. The argument from an economic perspective is that basic income is more efficient per pound spend than a lot of current benefits. However you could have hybrid systems of needs-based benefit AND unconditional income.

3. **Is it fair to give it to everyone, poor and rich alike?**  
I think a lot of people would argue that it isn't, and you provide good examples as to why. But I think the reason why it's so important that everyone gets it is that it creates an institution and a *universal standard*. Think of the NHS. It's unthinkable in the UK for someone who gets run over by a car to not get an ambulance ride to their local A&amp;E. Doesn't matter, rich or poor, this is a UK institution and it helps everyone. The fact that wealthy people can get free care doesn't take away the free care that poor people can get too.

Finally I worry these might not be the most satisfying answers, but that's because the answers are **in the details**. And we're at the stage where we're talking about the possibility, rather than the details. 

Think of the process of engineering a helicopter. Your buddy sits down and says ""Hey, I think we can make a flying machine by attaching a rotating wing to the top of the engine"". It's easy to say ""Well how do you deal with rotation? How do you ensure the wing doesn't fall off? How fast does it have to rotate?"" which are good questions, but in a way are premature. 

We know a wing provides lift, by powering a single wing we should generate enough lift to get flight, at this stage what we want to start doing is talking about it over coffee, and maybe thinking about what a prototype version 1 would start to look like. We aren't just fiddling with the benefit budget, we're talking about inventing a whole new social security system that nobody else in the world is using yet. The precise parameters can vary massively depending on the country, the economic context, the political context, demographics, and so on and so forth.",0,1407748523,null,0,false,0,cjmyats,t3_2d5mug,t1_cjmyats,t1_cjmh9z7,null,1435179242,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Cycling is very much limited in terms of payload, passengers, range vs. time and usage may vary depending on weather (which – this being the UK – is not something we can claim is fantastic all through the year). 

But let’s bear in mind the source of this – Chris Boardman: policy advisor to British Cycling. Clearly then here is a man with an invested interest in seeing increased funding for cyclists. That’s fine – but it should warn us of blinkered vision when it comes to how he presents his arguments. 

As a disclaimer I’ll say now I’m entirely in favour of segregated cycling infrastructure in our major cities and ideally in major towns as well. 

However suggestion (without limit) that we make cycling and walking our preferred method of transport and that it has no downsides is to completely avoid some very salient points on human transportation.

His claim that he studied at the University of Perugia was later found to be false after an investigation by the BBC. His office subsequently admitted that he attended the Italian Università per Stranieri (founded 1921) in Perugia for a year but he did not obtain any qualifications or finish his exams.

Duncan Smith's biography, on the Conservative Party website, claimed he was ""educated at Dunchurch College of Management"" but following questioning by the BBC his office confirmed that he did not get any qualifications there either, stating that he completed six separate courses lasting a few days each, adding up to about a month in total.

He married Elizabeth ""Betsy"" Fremantle, daughter of the 5th Baron Cottesloe, in 1982. The couple have four children, and live in a country house belonging to his father-in-law's estate in Swanbourne, Buckinghamshire.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; I think that the electric bicycle changes a lot of that.

Not for heavy payloads / multiple passengers though. Then there's a question of security: bike theft is a big problem here in Birmingham (and we're in a city centre where I *would* encourage a segregated cycling infrastructure). 

&gt; Having infrastructure that would make people feel safer would be a massive benefit. 

Agreed. 

&gt; The only time the weather forces me to stop, is when it's snowy/ice risk.

Fair but I have to wonder about the confidence of the person doing the cycling also. The pro-cycling group tend to be people who are already comfortable with cycling – but not everyone has the same coordination, reactions, balance etc. to make them good comfortable cyclists. 

The idea that ‘any normal healthy adult could do it’ (which I’ve seen people say) is a slightly bull-headed assumption that everyone naturally *wants* to and – furthermore – wants to and it’s the right choice of transport for whatever journey they’re making. There are plenty of instances where it wouldn’t be. 

&gt; I will also add, I'm more than slightly biased, as I'm nursing a fractured arm, why? Because a driver decided I shouldn't be on the road and decided to give me a scare. Want to know something really infuriating, I'd been doing 2mph above the speed limit, I just made the mistake of slowing for a dangerous crossing.


I’m genuinely sorry to hear it and I can sympathise – I’ve been hit by cars twice whilst cycling (fortunately without serious injury). The first was a genuine vehicle failure (her brakes failed) and the second was a young driver not checking their blind spot before pulling out into the road from a parked position. Both were incredibly apologetic. I count myself lucky. 

The first time I took my bike out here in Birmingham a woman decided to pass me then immediately take the turning on our left – cutting me up completely – if I hadn’t stopped, I’d have hit her. I’m no stranger to bad drivers. 

Point being (as above) I’m 100% in favour of separate cycling infrastructure for the benefit of all. 

But I don’t believe that it’s an answer across the whole country – it’s just not that simple – there are ample locations, situations and instances where cycling is not the practical answer in getting from A to B. If we focus just on inner cities and towns then it’s a lot more viable – but the country isn’t made up just of those areas. 

As a parting thought I would sorely hope cyclists are forced (and I do mean forced) to use the dedicated infrastructure that is made. I say that because this morning I watched a guy on a racing bike come out of a shared pedestrian/cycle lane onto a zebra crossing and then onto the main road in front of a car. The cycle lane continued in the same direction – no need to do what he did. I don’t mean to demonize cyclists but practically if we’re going to spend money on infrastructure it needs to be used.

Doing a STEM degree the biggest hurdles was I'd not used that level of maths for a couple of decades so it took a fair bit of getting back up to speed. Upside was that time management was better so I had no problem of getting stuff done well ahead of deadlines and having worked for decades had no problem with the ""self teaching"" aspect of university.

You are right that

 &gt;Although John Terry and Gary Cahill performed pretty well last campaign, defensive strength in depth is a card that Jose Mourinho does not have in his pack at the moment

After all, Kurt Zouma, Branislav Ivanovic, Felipe Luis, Azpilicueta, Nathan Ake, Terry and Cahill offers the bare minimum in depth that Chelsea might want. By my count, that is five centre backs, three left backs, three rightbacks. 

Similarly:

&gt; The English centre back pairing may do well against the likes of West Brom, Aston Villa and QPR, but the real test of Champions League football may still be beyond them. 

This is completely true as Cahill and Terry have never been tested in the Champions League before, and have historically really struggled to lock down prolific attackers like Messi, Suarez, Van Persie and Cavani. Those four all have an impressive scoring record against Chelsea. Imagine how good those two would be if they'd had some experience progressing a long way through European competitions. 

&gt;Questions are also surfacing over how Chelsea will use their attacking players next season. Will Cesc Fabregas be free to roam alongside the likes of Eden Hazard and Oscar? Will Andre Schurrle finally be preferred to Willian after his impressive World Cup performances with Germany? 

You're asking all the right questions. What a horrible dilemma for Mourinho and Chelsea. Imagine having a selection of talented, young, attacking midfielders, who are all full internationals for the best footballing countries in the world, experienced, and proven in the Premier League. 

&gt;In acquiring many of the players who knocked them out of last year’s tournament, perhaps Chelsea have sought a new style and philosophy from Atletico Madrid as they look to challenge for the most converted club trophy in Europe. 

You're right, it will be strange to see a Chelsea based on a 4-2-3-1 with a strong defence, high intensity pressing high up the pitch, and fast counter-attacking from the wings. Hang on, that seems awfully familiar, where have I seen a side like that before? 

&gt; Whilst fans will be hoping Diego Costa’s goals will fire them to title glory, they will also be acutely aware that Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool have made some equally significant signings this summer 

Manchester United have signed a manager and a midfielder, Arsenal have signed an attacking midfielder – a position they were traditionally weak in,  and Liverpool seem to have signed almost an entire mid-table side -  whilst losing their best player. Ricky Lambert is a  much scarier proposition than Suarez. 

&gt;Success depends not on the Chelsea players so much, but more on Mourinho’s ability to get them playing as a well-oiled unit. 

Yes, managers are important. Jose has historically struggled to get players playing as a well-oiled unit – particularly against big sides. 

&gt;Even for the so called ‘special one’ however, that is a task much easier said than done.  

Good finishing statement.

We have pace down the back with a probable formation of Traore - Caulker - Rio - Onuoha - Isla/Simpson. All of these players quality enough to suffice.

Midfield will be weaker with Barton, Faurlin and Mutch. This is where i would like to see players like Diame, Fer or De Guzman slotting in. If we can sign either one of these three as well as pen a one-year deal for Collison, i do see enough skill to seal a **14-16th** place finish, of which i would be more than happy.

Our forward line on the other hand is a bit sketchy. Remy and Austin are class and could possibly be the best pairing i have seen for a while in my short QPR following, but we need more strikers. Bobby Z has been performing quite well IMO. He has made a real influence in the last 20-30 minutes of our past games, and should be a good sub even in the prem. I still think we should have got Stevie May, who signed for Sheff Wednesday, but i think if we signed another striker on the lines of a Deeney (but not a his price) we should be fine.

Overall, **14-16th**.

Understanding how big an impact declining global EROEI will have on the global economy is a *massive* gap in the understanding of a lot of people in high places.

That used to be fine because energy could essentially be approximated by saying it was cheap and limitless.  That assumption is no longer valid, and it's this increasing cost of energy which is probably the underlying thread tying the general global economic malaise together.

Looking at the economy through an energy framework does a far better job of explaining much of what's happened over the last decade or so.  It also explains things like this:

The lifetime of the van is 5 years after which the painter will scrap the van.

The painter must now calculate his business expenses. He earns money from clients and spends money on business expenses like petrol and paint. One of these expenses required to continue business is the usage of the van.

Thus over the 5 year lifetime of the van, the painter will record 1/5th of the cost of the van as an ""expense"" and eventually scrap it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I personally think the league is going to finish with us and Utd fighting it out for 4th place.

Chelsea for me should be winning the league, Mourinhos team looked very good last season and they've only strengthened this year with Fabregas (Who will be a stand out player for them)  and Filipe Luis coming in. On top of this they have finally addressed their striker issue, Costa I think will struggle a bit at first but he's a cut above Ba/Eto'o/current Torres and suits their system very well. 

City are City, they have such an amazingly strong squad and play very good football. They haven't done alot of business this time around (due to FFP) but that shouldn't matter, especially with players like Jovetic/Richards coming back from LT injuries and strengthening in key areas. Now that Pelligrini has a trophy under his belt as well I can see them going on and definitely getting some silverware this year.

Arsenal look very good at the moment and have finally started stepping up in the window. Ozil for me is the player. He was at his world class best sporadically last season but now he should be settled with the league. Alongside Mertesacker and Podolski he has just won a world cup so confidence should be at an all time high. They have signed a new fitness coach and conducted other solid business in players such as Sanchez and Chambers who can cover various positions.As such, their squad shouldn't suffer as much through injuries as in previous years and having won some silverware last season, for me, they are the team to watch. 

That brings me down to the final spot in the top 4. Utd unfortunately look very good under Van Gaal. Who has shown in the summer the extent of the results he can get with a somewhat inferior squad. They will also benefit, as we did last season, from not having any european football. No mid week games for them will allow them to build momentum weekend after weekend which gets me worried. They still for me need to do business in the form of a decent CM and a new CB or two. That and the business we need to do I think are absolutely key. If Utd make those signings and we don't get another top striker and Moreno/another LB. They will beat us to the top 4, we have strengthened our squad really well but with the extra games we have to play, I think it will go right down to the last few games of the season save for something unexpected happening along the way.

How many unemployed people, or people who want to have better work conditions, are there in the world? The answer is significantly higher than the amount that cross borders to resolve it. Therefore, the people who immigrate to the UK are already of a particular character. You're not getting an accurate cross section of the population of where they come from. 

The same applies to the British. There are a small percentage who are willing to relocate for work, particularly when the only things on offer are entry-level jobs. Most immigrants are either moving with family, moving away from something horrendous or are the type of person who can move away from everything and start again. That last one is an incredibly big, scary thing to do, and I don't think it's fair that we're at the point where some people will heavily judge others for *not* doingn this for a £250 a week job.

Last season was incredible, we should be prepared that this year might not live up to that.

* We have a team that needs to gel and adjust. It could be a rocky time in the first 20 games. Big highs, big lows potentially. After last year some fans wont be expecting the lows, they'll expect us to blow teams away again. Teams will sit deep and soak up our play (if they want to stifle us anyway).
* Top four will be tighter than ever, rejuvenated Spurs, United, strong City and Chelsea, Everton continuing progress, Arsenal in the mix as usual.
* We could legitimately sit 7th at Christmas and not be doing too badly. If we are there will be moaning of course. However, we're a young side that needs to gel the new boys in and we now have CL commitments.

Sterling, Coutinho will shoulder more responsibility in his absence, but they won't step up to that comfortably straight away. Luis took the spotlight which allowed them to play without fear last season.

&gt;&gt;Q: “But lots of people didn’t vote for the current government. People in Liverpool or Manchester didn’t vote for the Tories either, but they still got them as a government.”

&gt;&gt;A: The unit of measurement for democracy in governmental elections is nations, not cities. No government ever gets 100% of the vote, and indeed it’s decades since any UK government even managed 50%. Some individuals or regions will always get a government they didn’t vote for. But the referendum hinges on whether you think Scotland is a country or
just a region of one. It can’t be both.

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"I have strong doubts that UK shale will ever produce much, though I could be wrong since there's so little well data.  The shale in the northwest is, to my knowledge, quite heavily faulted and fractured.  This makes extracting anything from it extremely difficult, since there's basically no permeability and so you get very low flow rates.  It was this that caused the massive recent write-down in shale prospectivity in the Monterey play in the US.  Politically shale is also a hot potato here, since unlike in the US landowners don't have mineral rights, and as such are less inclined to allow drilling rigs nearby.  We've also got barely any onshore drilling rigs or expertise in this country, and that would take time to roll out and develop.

Nuclear (which I also worked in for a number of years) has a problem, in that it's actually somehow got more expensive over time, instead of less expensive as normally happens with technology.  We need to get a politically acceptable waste storage facility built 10 years ago.  And given the long constuction, we're looking at at least a 10 year wait until hinkley c comes online, and that's with no other plants planned and most of the AGR fleet scheduled to be decomissioned by then.  It would require *massive* up front capital investment, and I don't see where the money comes from.

Fusion has twin issues.  The first being that there has been minimal research into materials which can withstand the insane neutron bombardment.  A commercial fusion reactor made from modern materials would start to crumble to bits within 5-10 years.  Secondly, nobody knows where the deuterium will come from.  Presently, all deuterium is produced from CANDU heavy water reactors, most of which are closing over the next decade or so.  Deuterium has a half life of about 10 years, so when they close our stocks rapidly evaporate, and you need a lot to kick start any fusion reactor.  ITER is nice, but it's just a plasma physics experiment.  There's lots of dirty, boring work needs doing to get a working fusion reactor going.  Even if we got it working, I'd bet my house that burning coal would produce cheaper electricity.  Fusion reactors won't come cheap and won't produce infinite energy.

Germany is an instructive example, as they've tried to go for as much renewables as they can over the last 5 years or so.  The result thus far is that they've massively increased coal usage, are exporting shitloads of cheap solar power when nobody wants to buy it and energy bills have gone up.

true,TheParisOne,eng-Herefordshire,Herefordshire now in France,"I don't get it. People are saying that immigrants are stealing jobs on the one hand, then saying there are no jobs on the other. 

Make up your mind. You can't have both options. Either there are jobs that are going to immigrants (a lot of whom won't have great English, or even be educated)which means there are jobs (so go get them, English people), or there aren't any jobs, so why are you worried about immigrants taking them? 

As far as I can see, immigrants are willing to work for very low wages and live in horrible houses because they are usually desperate to get out of their original homes - what is offered in the UK is far better than they can find at home. 

If the UK stopped with this stupid 0 hour contract business, and ensured that everyone that worked received adequate compensation (which enabled them to pay rent/mortgage (if they exist any more)/utility bills/general living expenses plus a little extra for comforts (no-one can live without relaxation/fun), the job position would most likely be a lot better. 

That would result in more UK people working (other than those who really don't want to, and face it, they do exist) and therefore, fewer openings for immigrants. 

Mind, then we may have the situation of too many immigrants claiming benefits because the UK will always take immigrants (it's part of being the UK), while the UK people supported them through taxes. 

Hmm tricky situation. Not too sure that there is actually a perfect solution.

This means that even though everyone knows he is the Doctor, he almost appears not to be if you look at the show from an unbiased, objective angle.  

I believe that the character should only be included in images that pertain to the show's lore, and not in those that only pertain to the show itself.  After all, he never had any episodes, seasons, movies, etc. that were specifically depicting him as THE Doctor rather than A Doctor.

I'm not sure I can agree on that, modern ""British Values"" are direct result of The Enlightenment which was one of the greatest proponents of secularism and rational thinking. [The Counter-Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Enlightenment) movement was largely religiously motivated as Deism is a direct attack on the churches authority. It wasn't until that approach failed that ""conservatism"" came along to try it's luck. 

&gt;  just as trying to look at middle eastern politics as separate from religion makes no sense today.

I have to passionately disagree with that. The conflicts in the middle east have absolutely nothing to do with religion. In every single case there is a group of people who self-identify as being unique fighting against another group for territory and power and/or against some perceived form of injustice. You could take any combination group/religion and expect the same results in the same situation. 

Blaming religion is a cheap cop out that avoids us needing to discuss things like our role in supporting ISIS in Libya/Syria since 2009, a fact of which I've been bitching about on reddit since that time.

I ask as just this morning I was stood on a piece of pavement with a shared cycle lane that was entirely clear of pedestrians and traffic. A cyclist was riding towards me on it. 

As he neared a zebra crossing he cut across the pedestrian pavement, onto the crossing and into the road in front of a car - where he continued his journey parallel to the cycle lane. He didn't take any turnings requiring that he be in the road at that point - he just moved from cycle lane to road. 

The cycle lane is in fine repair by the way - free of rubbish, people, dogs, TARDIS's etc. 

Blanket claims that 'those cycle lanes are not any good' doesn't really cut it when there are plenty that are (around Birmingham at least - I use them) but many cyclists prefer to weave between lane, pavement and road.

I submit for consideration that *some* cyclists (not all) are simply selfish - as drivers and pedestrians (and therefore people) can also be - and that sometimes it's more about that selfishness than any chronic *need*.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"You're mostly there in how costs are spread, but your terminology is a bit off. It's not recorded as an expense, it's recorded as depreciation.

When a painter buys a van, he spends, say, £15k in cash but then acquires £15k's worth of van in that deal. That van is a tangible asset, and if he was to sell his company it would be worth the same amount before he bought the van than after, all he's done is replace £15k of cash with £15k of assets. A year later, you would argue that van isn't worth £15k any more, as it has depreciated in value from what was paid as it's now a year older, and the painter has to somehow represent that loss in his books when he values the company. So it gets marked as depreciation of assets. It's not actual money out the door (which would be an expense), it's the company losing money through the assets it owns becoming less valuable as they age.

Accounting practice states that assets can get marked down over the years they get used, because otherwise it gets hard to judge company performance from profit/loss statements - it could be a company is doing badly, or it could be that they just bought a load of stuff in this particular year that gave them a huge loss in the short-term but will help them be profitable for the next 10 years. It's pretty typical to just depreciate assets in a linear way by dividing their value over their expected life and then just marking down your total asset value by the depreciated amount each year - this way it irons out some of the bumps when companies buy expensive bits of equipment or other capital. With players it's the same, given that the club 'owns' the player, but in this case the contract becomes the benchmark because it's the only measure of the ""life"" a club will get from a player. 

In a similar fashion, when selling the player you don't actually get the full value back in the books, because you lose whatever value the club still held in the player that hadn't been depreciated. If we sell a player for £20m who was 2 years into a 4 year contract and bought at £10m, then our Profit/Loss only sees £15m profit because the player would still hold £5m value as a club asset on the books.",0,1407758728,null,0,1407763309,0,cjn0bvw,t3_2d7t8v,t1_cjn0bvw,t1_cjmz52o,null,1435180198,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

So, for Scots who live outside of Scotland at time of independence, they'll need to register to become Scottish. For English who ""accidentally"" became Scottish, they'll need to unregister.

Here's some info:
http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/0043/00439021.pdf
Read page 16:
&gt;Citizenship and passports
&gt;In taking forward the result of a vote for independence, we will ensure that British citizens “habitually resident” in Scotland on independence will automatically be considered Scottish citizens. This will include British citizens who hold dual citizenship with another country. Scottish-born British citizens currently living outside of Scotland will also automatically be considered  Scottish citizens. Other people will be able to register or apply for Scottish citizenship on independence based on clear criteria. All Scottish citizens will have the right to acquire a Scottish passport, although there will be no requirement to hold one. We plan that citizens will be able to apply for Scottish passports from the date of independence.

NOTE: Citizenship and Passports are two different things... Your British Citizenship passport will be OK until it's run out. Then when you get a new passport, it'll be a Scottish one.

Also note that it'll be up to the UK if they want to give you a UK citizenship... If Scotland becomes independent, and you become a Scottish citizen, then the UK doesn't have to give you a UK citizenship for dual nationality (though I believe you can give up your Scottish citizenship and become a UK citizen if you believe that's what you should be).

Also, I should mention, there's no plan for Scotland to leave the CTA (Common Travel Area between Great Britain, NI and Ireland), and thus there's no plans for Scotland to join Schengen (probably wouldn't be allowed to join anyway). So that's a-whole-nother story...

5. Get a job earning above £18600 that will start within 3 months of your revised date of travel to the UK. 
6. Apply for a join family in the UK visa. 

I of course advise you to get in contact with an immigration solicitor in the UK. However, based upon the rules and guidance available on the UK .gov site, the above procedure should work for you. Basically, they are predominantly concerned about the amount of money that you earn / have. So make sure that you do not leave your job in the US yet, and get hunting for one in the UK. You will need a confirmed offer of employment for this to work. 

You also may have to travel ahead of her if your new job starts before they have processed her visa application. It is very important that she does not risk denial of entry into the UK in the meantime. In many ways the UK immigration service (UKBA) is stricter than the US.

I reckon most people want to work, and the obstacles are lack of qualifications and not living in the right area, among other things. The opening of labour markets to India, the Caribbean and Europe has meant that those willing to uproot themselves and work in poor conditions have an edge over those who wish to stay put, and are less willing to undergo hardship. (That would still be true if we raised the minimum wage, by the by.)

I don't mean either of those things as a criticism of the unemployed, but as an observation on the causes of it. It would be perfectly possible for governments to adopt a more protectionist attitude to native labour, even if this made the country less business friendly as a whole.

That's a little tricky though, isn't it? Even in this thread there are people saying 'most healthy adults could use a bike for most trips' - some neat generalisations to strongly imply adults should be cycling whilst carefully avoiding closed language - so that when we say 'but what about mothers and babies, what about people moving heavy equipment or passengers' it can be turned around to say 'oh but of course not *them*'. 

I don't say this to be an arse - but there are people here and in the past implying that cycling is what we need and that it's accessible to most. It is - but there are plenty of situations when it *isn't*. That doesn't mean we shouldn't try and improve the infrastructure, but it does mean we shouldn't do it to the exclusion of all else. 

&gt; I think this is one of the weakest arguments I hear. Waterproofs, lockers, pannier are available. Motorbikers bike all year round with little problem.

My work doesn't have any lockers and we're moving offices - the new one won't have a shower either. Motorbikers may bike all year round but leathers and a big helmet make better defences against downpours than all but the strictest waterproofs. 

(It's just wrong to assume that we all have the same access to a change of clothes / shower / etc. at either end of our journeys - or that we all feel equally comfortable cycling in whatever weather. If people cycle less because of it - I'm afraid you have to acknolwedge it's a problem. A few die-hards who keep on pedalling are not enough to disprove this). 

&gt; Not really. You're thinking too much like a motorist :). 4 bikes can transport the same amount of people as a car.

Assuming all four people have access to bikes / *want* to cycle / are capable of cycling etc. - you're thinking too much like a cyclist ;) 

&gt;  range vs. time

Fair point about right tools for the job - that's why I've been advocating bike infrastructure in cities and major towns though. On (for example) the M3 between London and Southampton? No thanks. 

I really do think we need more money spent on cycling - but I'm wary of those (and you're not one of them, don't worry) that say that cycling is the *only* solution and we'd all do it if we only had the infrastructure.

I think the issues comes down to what is meant by this statement. Some people seem to be taking it as saying that most of the money spent on roads should instead be spent on improving the cycling network, which does seem like a bad idea.

Others are taking it as meaning that cycling should be made a priority in a more general sense, while not allowing the road network to suffer. Encouraging people to make shorter journeys by bike or walking for example, and making those journeys easier to make. 

The sentence isn't very clear and the article doesn't go into much detail so its hard to know what Boardman is actually trying to say.

The parking would be priced as current residents permits for residents, with some level of security (ideally deccent CCTV at least) which isn't present with current on road parking allowing long term off road parking for the majority of cars.  On street parking can then be reserved for deliveries, taxis, disabled parking, the odd zipcar, emergency services and bikes.  With that it'll be much easier to cycle around due to lower traffic and fewer parked cars, and I might even venture back into Brighton to do some shopping, which I now avoid due to the ridiculous congestion caused by bus lanes and low speed limits.

If you'd like me to start recounting the *daily* times I see this during my 5 / 10 minute exposure to that particular piece of pavement - well - I'd have plenty of evidence to prove my point. Spend some time in any major town you like to find cyclists who make up their own route of route/pavement/road. 

That's not to say drivers are any better when it comes to road law - but that's not the point. If you're going to spend a lot of money on a cycling infrastructure, is it not realistic to expect it to be used when there's the option of that or the roads that cyclists complain about? 

&gt; The point of cycle infrastructure isn't to get cyclists off roads, it's to get drivers and passengers out of their cars.

Impractical. Ample different scenarios where a journey requires a car, not a bike. Furthermore I've seen more than enough arguements *from cyclists* saying that they want to be segregated and away from drivers and roads. 

That makes sense to me. Some roads are simply dangerous in their current form when mixing different forms of transport - it's not fair on anyone. Let's move the soft squishing vunerable cyclists away from the big metal boxes. Why not? 

But when that facility is there and cyclists instead insist on using the roads they claim to hate sharing with bad drivers - well - that's a bit daft is it not? Can't have it both ways.

&gt;**Either that or he's fine with legal Sharia courts practising in the UK.**

[Sharia courts do not supercede british law. Where they do exist, they operate as any other civil arbitration service would, and any agreement is only legally binding if both parties agree to it, again, as any civil arbitration service works.](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-qa-sharia-law-uk/18486)

&gt;There is a nationwide network of at least 10 bodies run by the Islamic Sharia Council, based in Leyton, east London. These deal overwhelmingly with matrimonial problems but have no real powers under English law.
&gt;
&gt; They can dissolve religious marriages, which is clearly an important matter for observant Muslims, but only a court can end a civil marriage.
&gt; 
&gt; Another well-known organisation is the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal, which offers a dispute resolution service in a number of areas of civil law, and whose decisions can be legally binding.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; No Islamic body has any jurisdiction in the criminal law, despite newspaper reports of informal councils of elders settling criminal cases in some Muslim communities.
&gt; 
&gt; Rulings handed down by the Muslim Arbitration Tribunal can be legally binding. But this is not because of any special recognition of the wisdom of the sharia principles it follows.
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; **It’s simply because the arbitration act 1996 allows almost any body to act as a dispute resolution service if both parties agreed to be bound by its decision.**
&gt; 
&gt; ...
&gt; 
&gt; “It must be recognised, however, that any sanctions for a failure to comply with the agreed terms of the mediation would be drawn from the laws of England and Wales.
&gt; 
&gt; **“The Ministry of Justice’s position is that sharia ‘law’ has no jurisdiction in England and Wales and the Government has no intention to change this position”.**

The article, and you, make further mention of some islamic bodies wanting to get sharia law recognised by the UK. To believe that this will occur on any reasonably foreseeable timescale is, to put it bluntly, ridiculous, given the parliamentary system we have to pass acts through the house of commons.

&gt;fine with the rampant homophobia and sexism that exists, fine with the desire to take over institutions like schools and councils

Its plainly obvious that nobody is fine with this, otherwise there wouldnt be[ numerous investigations into the birmingham schools once evidence came to light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Trojan_Horse#Government_report), or[ investigations into allegations of electoral fraud in tower hamlets.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10877000/Tower-Hamlets-election-two-arrests-eight-police-investigations-into-malpractice.html)

They can complain about it all they want, they can try and persuade others not to do it all they want. The right to complain about things is as much a part of the fabric of our culture as drinking, sex and bacon are.

The UK government have stated they won't make any negotiations on Scotland's behalf prior to the vote.

Spend some time in any major town you like to find cyclists who make up their own route of route/pavement/road.

You're totally missing the point. The issue isn't whether there are cyclists who *don't* use a shared lane, it's whether there are cyclists who *do*.

&gt; That's not to say drivers are any better when it comes to road law - but that's not the point. If you're going to spend a lot of money on a cycling infrastructure, is it not realistic to expect it to be used when there's the option of that or the roads that cyclists complain about?

If we're going to spend a lot of money on infrastructure, I'd hope to see something better than a few strips of paint on a pavement. Realistically, commuter cyclists are only going to use it if and where it's a better option than the road.

&gt; Impractical. Ample different scenarios where a journey requires a car, not a bike.

Which doesn't apply to the majority of car journeys.

&gt; Furthermore I've seen more than enough arguements from cyclists saying that they want to be segregated and away from drivers and roads.

There's a difference between cyclists and cycling advocacy organisations. Current cyclists by definition are willing to tolerate the atrocious state of today's roads. Cycling advocates recognise that to get *more* people out of cars you need to improve the current provision.

&gt; But when that facility is there and cyclists instead insist on using the roads they claim to hate sharing with bad drivers - well - that's a bit daft is it not? Can't have it both ways.

No-one wants to share the roads with bad drivers. If cyclists are continuing to use the main carriageway when a cycle facility is present, that should tell you something about how safe and practical it actually is to use.",0,1407765819,null,0,false,0,cjn2kjd,t3_2d7wh5,t1_cjn2kjd,t1_cjn1m5u,null,1435181254,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I'd also say the lack of Scotland producing talent and the UK not having essentially feeder nations like a lot of other leagues and stricter work permit laws ALSO hamper our favorite XI. 

Just a few years ago this wasn't a stepping stone club, and now because of the insane money that has been fused into other parts of the world game it is becoming more and more so, just like big clubs in other leagues out of the top tier (Greece for example). 

I just think if Lawell comes out and says ""Look, we have no money, the league gives our team f-all, we can't get our own rights, we have to rely essentially on European money every year to run an adequate business model and rely on money strictly from our fan base and can't sign any players over 2m unless we sell off players we need to compete"" that it's lose-lose from a business sense.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; You're totally missing the point. The issue isn't whether there are cyclists who don't use a shared lane, it's whether there are cyclists who do.

Fine, there are. So what's your point? Mine is that if the lane is built and adequately does the job - why not use it? Seems there are cyclists out there who don't - and as I said above you can't have it both ways. 

&gt; If we're going to spend a lot of money on infrastructure, I'd hope to see something better than a few strips of paint on a pavement. Realistically, commuter cyclists are only going to use it if and where it's a better option than the road.

What are you expecting? 

The lane I’m thinking of by means of an example is wide, well lit by local street lighting, has zero obstructions (beyond errant pedestrians, though there’s no correlation between cyclists not using the lane and pedestrians being in it). The lane runs parallel to the road with the exact same destination and the safety of not being in a busy arterial road (which also has a bus stop in it!). 

So again, what are you expecting? 

&gt; Which doesn't apply to the majority of car journeys.

Generalisation. 

&gt;  Current cyclists by definition are willing to tolerate the atrocious state of today's roads.

Perhaps due to lack of options? I've seen plenty that don't like them - myself included. 

&gt; No-one wants to share the roads with bad drivers. If cyclists are continuing to use the main carriageway when a cycle facility is present, that should tell you something about how safe and practical it actually is to use.

Or it tells me something about the mentality of cyclists - plenty of whom remain selfish. These are the ones that weave around pedestrians, cross red lights and zebra crossings, jump at will between cycle lane, road and pavement… the list goes on. 

You’re quick to blame everything but human error here. It feels like you’re apologising for something.

You don’t find me saying that the infrastructure is perfect – but I choose my examples carefully. If my example from this morning’s experience was of a cycle lane populated with road works, parked cars and whatever else – I’d surely not use it as it’s an awful example you could easily tear apart. My example stands *because it’s so suited to cycling – yet some cyclists would rather jump across a pavement to pull infront of cars on a zebra crossing*.

For a 17 year old, £1000 is significantly more valuable; it's the choice of going to uni or not, partying endlessly, buying the latest gadget or having the complete opposite point of view to impulsive spenders of the 80's and 90's, changing his lifestyle (possibly).

You're also suggesting that lump sums should be spent as the interest they earn is seldom worth it and then given an example of a 30% increase - this is also silly (I'm not even going to explain why). You're viewing the money comparatively to your own cash and the reality is, every penny counts and is valuable to somebody so try not to disregard people so aggressively.

What the general consensus is, is save as much as possible, as early on a possible; be it via a wage or via lump sums, it's generally a good idea - especially if you're saving for something (like a house for example).

I don't think thats how the leadership is, I think thats how most supporters are. 

&gt;Most of the thorny issues (and this isn't one, it's well settled) can't actually be clarified since the UK government refuses to engage in prospective negotiations.

Could you expand a bit more here, I mean for one why engage in prospective negocitations before the vote is even held, given it could prejudice the public towards it?

And even then, if the SNP is going to say shit like 'play it our way or we won't take the debt'. That at the very least hardly going to impell the UK goverment to come to the table willing to make any concessions. 

&gt;It isn't enormously unreasonable for the UK government to feel disinclined to spend months hammering out the shape of a separation agreement before a yes vote, but given that they've chosen to adopt this approach, it is unreasonable to then blame the SNP for the refusal of the UK govt to be forthcoming.

Why? I don't get how its unreasonable, as I said above. Why act like something is a thing, beofore its clear at all if it will be a thing. Indeed to do otherwise, as I imagine the SNP's best case for this strategy might have been, makes it out to be the 'natural conclusion'. Which frankly, its never been fair to say its been.

wut?

you made two claims about currency unions, I was refering to your one about norway.

Also if we are talking about the Belgium–Luxembourg Economic Union now. Then we are also dealing with a different kettle of fish, as thats the situation back in 1921, where the luxenbourg franc and the Belgium franc were pegged against each other. Not the whole 'low countries'. 

Furthermore, that was two pre-existing currencies being pegged against each other. Which against is not the SNP plan, the SNP wants to keep the pound, not to have a scotish and British pound and peg them against each other. It's not actually a minor distincton. As both parties in your *second* example could set their own monetary policy, they just had to maintain parity by (I imagine at the time purcasing silver) between the two currencies at a fixed rate. 

And if we are talking about its what followed, benlux, well then we are talking about the ECC, and we'll pretty quickly we are talking about the Euro.. and yeah, that has fucked a few countries over quite a bit actually. 

Edit: in short your whole argument that 'well currency union is no biggie' simply is not the case. To go down the pegging route is not trivial and requiring, in a modern system purchasing VAST amounts of currency off each other (getting very complex when there is a significant asymmetry between the size of the economies, which is why it's so rarely practiced). Nor is its what on the table, the SNP is not calling for a Scotish pound - which fuck might have been a reasonable demand, but I imagine they realize would be unsustainable quickly as it would have required buying vast amounts of British pounds to maintain a required value. Other examples outside of your either wrong (The Scandinavian currency union collapsed in the 1910's) or quickly start melding into a larger discussion about the Euro as a currency union, which is full of examples of smaller economies being shafted by not having control of their monetary policy.

It's not the same as Torres losing pace or Stevie G's bones creaking. Decision making and technique can be learned and improved. Walcott is a great example of this.

If we're going to use last season as a measuring stick for Andros, let's use it for the rest of the team: Soldado is a useless striker, Vertonghen lacks any sort of desire, and Paulinho doesn't seem to do anything. It's only because we've seen these players for multiple seasons that we know that we've actually got one of the best strikers in the Spanish league, a Barcelona-worthy defender and the core of (what was) an outstanding Brazilian team.

I think Denmark and Holland have had such success because they've effectively normalised cycling as something that *everyone* does. From kids first going to school on their own, to businessmen going to work, to women riding out to lunch and the elderly doing their shopping. 

In those countries, ""Cycling"" isn't a word that referes to an out-group of enthusiasts, its something everyone does.

Doesn't matter. I got downvoted for saying

* Townsend hasn't learnt a thing and imo is good for a dozen backup games, but not close to being the quality we need to challenge the top 4

* Townsend has some good tools, he's quick, he's got a decent left foot when he actually hits it right (so, 1 in 1500 shots), and he has pretty good technique. But he doesn't have IT.

* Or do we NEED a more direct AML? In which case Lennon (no), Townsend (needs a lot of work) and Chadli (no).

And I've also said in the past 2 days

* I would even rather Poch took Townsend to one side and focused intently on him rather than J Rod - he has the tools, he just can't use them.

Yet, it doesn't matter. If you voice an opinion that goes against the circlejerk, you get downvoted. I'm confused, because it's always *american* fans that do it - is there some kinda cultural difference or something? I mean that genuinely - I'm sure I've heard that's the case. Go on any forum, with fans that regularly attend games, live and breathe the club locally and the mood is **totally** different. I'll still use Reddit for other things as I always have - I only recently came on here because I figured I'd check it out, but back to Fighting Cock, Glory Glory and SpursCommunity I go. 

&gt;And when it comes to Townsend, I don't see how you can say that. His problem is quite clearly his decision making. He's fast a fuck, a good dribbler, has a hell of a shot when he takes the right one, and is an okay crosser of the ball. 

Like I said above, I've said that. Exactly that, in the past week. I've tried that angle of ''oh, he might come good'', but when you're getting a 10m offer that can potentially pay over half the fee for Depay, it's a complete no brainer.

It's nothing to do with Foreign Bias, and it's everything to do with a guy that I even said just 3 days ago -

* Townsend has some good tools, he's quick, he's got a decent left foot when he actually hits it right (so, 1 in 1500 shots), and he has pretty good technique. But he doesn't have IT.

It was the same exact argument with him last season. He got 25 games, not even excuses like bitpart performances - 25 full games under 2 different managers and still failed to perform at a level we need. Also, Depay is 3 years younger, already a better a player (imo, of course) and if 10m can pay over half the fee for him it's stupid. If it's such a big deal, why did we sell Livermore and are looking at Schneiderlin, which everyone wants. I don't get it.

Like I said, we've done that.

I've lived and worked with narcissists they all share 3 characteristics. 

1. They have an inflated sense of self
2. They can't admit fault
3. If people disagree with them, they play victim and find all kinds of conspiracy level reasons why EVERYONE disagrees with them or why it didn't matter in the first place, or they gaslight and rewrite what actually happened (i.e., I used ironic wrong because I was secretly thinking about Townsend situationally, blah blah blah)

This is because people like you are incapable of realizing maybe you're the problem, and you should work on yourself rather than constantly deflecting. This is also what you're doing with your comments about ""imaginary Karma points"". You obviously care about all these things you're pretending not to care about since you talk about this constantly.

Yes, in fact. I click the name and within the first page you can usually tell from posts on other Subs or their comments directly saying it. And I would say 95% of the time they are as it's something I've noticed compared to actually talking with people who live and breathe the club in a more literal way (i'm not downplaying the support regardless of where you live - just the attitude to players). ''Also, inb4 I live in Enfield and I downvote you'' I don't know how they'd cope actually going to games where you regularly here ''XXX IS A PIECE OF SHIT, GET THEM OFF'' and such. I've heard it's a cultural thing, which I wouldn't be surprised about - there was a good discussion on it actually on /r/soccer in which everyone agreed there was a clear difference in that respect. I would dig it out, but I'm too lazy.

How long do you give it then? I don't subscribe to this ''they wear the shirt, blindly support them'' sentimentality. He's had chances, and he hasn't proven himself. What more can you do? Another whole season full of it. Then what? At what point do you concede defeat and realize it's time for him to move on. He's not some 18 year old kid who's play a bit part role and I'm jumping on him. Or even a 21 year old. He's 23 now, he's at the age that first team spot should be locked down unless he is a literal very late bloomer. Problem is, we can't afford to wait for that.

true,DJ_Beardsquirt,eng-norfolk,Norwich,"&gt; Erm, okay. So the idea is we remove all other benefits and give everyone £433 a month instead? That can barely get you a room in a house share in a lot of the country. Even in the poorest shithole town that'll probably only leave you with £133 for the month.
So now you have £133 to live on for the month and you're crammed into a house with other poor people. What a fucking crummy existence.
The idea is fucking stupid. Realistically when you take into account property, bills, food, etc then £1100 is much nearer what you need to live.

Which is why we have housing benefit, which is not one of the benefits that needs to be replaced. There are a lot of people who earn less than £100 on the current benefits system and it's not pretty but it does happen. If you don't want to receive £433 a week then the solution is the same as it is now, work for it.

&gt; You're confusing monetary inflation for economic inflation. Inflation can happen without increasing the supply of money.

Well, monetary inflation is generally what people are talking about when they talk about inflation so that's what I assumed you meant.

true,strolls,null,null,"If you look at a lot of Tory rhetoric (e.g. Thatcher's ""no such thing as society"" speech), there's a lot of emphasis on the family. In fact the word is used by IDS in this article.

Family is very important in the way many Tories see the world - they see it as a parent's job to look out for their children, and they're typically people who are able to do so.

In the case of people like IDS, they're able to support their kid(s) until they're self-sufficient - an allowance through university, for example, and then whilst they're looking for a job upon graduation.

In the view of many tories it's a parent's job to provide this kind of support, not the state's.

There's so much I could write in criticism of toryism, I believe it's a totally flawed worldview, but they honestly don't consider the cases of those who are unable to help their kids, or those who've been screwed over by their parents. Naturally someone'll help them out - these are corner-cases so rare, they're barely worth considering.

There's a story in my family about how, when my dad went to Manchester Grammar School in the 1940's, his uniform overcoat cost a week's wages. Or it might have been half a week's, I can't recall, but the point is that it was a lot of money for a mill-worker - this kind of laudable sacrifice is toryism's working class narrative, that it's the parents' job to provide, and the government can keep out the way.

I wish I could explain the tory worldview more succinctly, because there's a lot more to say about them. I do think they're probably genuine, and ""nice people"", so much as you can be when you have a cuntish lack of empathy for anything outside your own experience.

Karma breakdown 

/r/coys link 20 comment 1242.

I've posted here regularly for about a month. I couldn't give two fucks about Karma, and i'm not saying they indicate nothing but that says it all, doesn't it? You're literally basing your entire opinion of me on one or two threads that include Townsend. That's evident, as if virtually every post I make about any subject gets negative points, why would I have that many upvotes? Hm? Can you explain that one? 

&gt;This is also what you're doing with your comments about ""imaginary Karma points"". 

See, sometimes when people say they don't care - they don't! Unless you tell me that I can cash them in for ££££, then I'm not bothered. The only reason I care is a) perfectly reasonable opinions get buried and b) it's indicative of peoples general opinions and feelings, as half of the people downvoting won't even explain why and if they do - it's generally, ''because you're a cunt''. Which leads nicely onto

&gt;The point of this sub IS discussion, but the point isn't constant discussion about what a victim you are 

Right, so I suppose I should just roll over and let people say what the fuck they want, which is normally nothing more than personal attacks and entirely their own opinion? Which funnily enough, is *just today* and just because I've spoken about Townsend? 

&gt;It's about the sports team we all like.

Exactly. I make my points, I get called a cunt. That's not discussing a sports team, is it? 

&gt;(i.e., I used ironic wrong because I was secretly thinking about Townsend situationally, blah blah blah)

That's exactly what happened though? I don't see why that is so difficult to comprehend, as it's gonna be one or the other.

Aside from that though, he's a very direct player which is something this team sorely lacked last season, he has a powerful shot with both feet (though his accuracy admittedly needs work), and he is a very hard worker.

true,ieya404,null,null,"There's a very well-written comment in the responses to that article by ""Stadius"":

&gt; You've got to sympathise to an extent with Salmond's problem: that when it comes to currency for an independent Scotland, there really is no good option. Recent experience in the eurozone has already demonstrated that currency union without political union is unworkable, and that's why the UK government has taken it off the table. Similarly no-one is seriously suggesting the euro, once the SNP's favoured option, as a desirable or realistic option. You hear some people suggest a separate Scottish currency, which would at least permit control over monetary and fiscal policy.

&gt; But let me break down the reasons a Scottish currency isn't being discussed seriously:

&gt; The first thing you have to understand is that an independent Scotland wants trade and investment. In particular, it wants to attract foreign investment in Scottish industry and to export more than it imports. Potential investors and buyers of Scottish exports are put off by two things: expense and risk.

&gt; If a currency is strong, that means Scottish products are more expensive to import and investment is more expensive; if it is weak, they are cheaper. If a currency is volatile, this makes investment and trade more risky. There are several reasons to suppose that a freely floating Scottish currency would be both excessively strong and particularly volatile:

&gt; One is that new currencies are always relatively volatile.

&gt; The other is oil. The demand for a country's currency is derived from the demand for the goods and services that country sells, and by the attractiveness of investment opportunities there. The exchange rates of the currencies of small countries in which exports of natural resources (usually oil) dominate the balance of payments, as Scotland would be, closely match changes in the demand for that export. These are sometimes known as *petrocurrencies*.

&gt; Because of the demand for oil, a Scottish currency would be very strong. This would be bad news for exporters, e.g. of agricultural produce and whisky, whose products would be much more expensive abroad as a result. Investment would also suffer for the same reason. This phenomenon is known as *Dutch disease* after the stagnation of Dutch industry following the discovery of natural gas there.

&gt; Also because of the demand for oil, a Scottish currency would be volatile. This is because the price of oil itself is very volatile.

&gt; The currencies of large countries, like the UK, are not as susceptible to these problems. The demand for oil, significant as it may be, doesn't affect the strength of sterling nearly as much as it would a Scottish currency. Neither does the volatility of oil prices affect the stability of sterling nearly as much, in part (again) because demand for oil is a much smaller component of overall demand, and partly because the risks are partly diversified away against a much larger and more diverse industrial base.

&gt; The option of pegging a Scottish currency to the pound (or euro, etc.) isn't attractive either. The volatility of oil revenues could force the Scottish government/central bank to intervene, for which massive currency reserves would be required. An independent Scotland would not be able to defend the peg against speculators for long.

&gt; Think of the recurring balance of payments crises under the Bretton Woods system, the 1997/1998 financial crises in Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia (and others to a lesser degree) and the eurozone crises in Greece, Spain, Italy, Ireland and Spain: all in small to medium economies which tried to maintain a currency peg or currency unions without political union.

&gt; A currency peg or currency union without political union would, sooner or later, lead to a Scottish financial crisis, and before long, an austerity programme would be imposed by the UK, the IMF, or both, as in Greece's Troika of the IMF, the European Commission and the ECB.

&gt; It seems therefore, that an independent Scotland would end up sliding into the unsatisfactory Sterlingisation option, in which the Bank of England would set monetary policy without regard for Scotland's macroeconomic situation. There's a deep irony to the *Sterlingisation* option too, that hasn't been picked up on yet: that the Scottish commercial banks, currently permitted to issue their own distinctively Scottish banknotes, would surely lose that privilege, so that a newly independent Scotland would likely see Robert the Bruce, Sir Walter Scott, Robert Burns and the rest disappear from its banknotes.

Then you have missed the point.

If the cycle path requires the cyclists to stop, run across multiple junctions between moving traffic thats leaving/entering the roundabout the cycle path has failed. This is dangerous (and inconvenient), and the best place for the cyclist to be would be off that cycle path and in traffic acting as traffic does.

That why ""use the highway code"" is not an answer to the original question. You might as well have said ""sausage"" :)

I NEVER said that - seriously, you're taking words out my mouth and completely twisting them to fit your personal agenda because you obviously dislike me (oo, victim complex again isn't it?). And like I said in the other thread, that to me is the typical behaviour of someone trying to drum up some little hate campaign against me for something I never said. And you call me a narcissistic cunt and say that I am being offensive? Holy fucking shit, you need to re-check yourself big time. I've not once personally insulted someone - yet I've been called a cunt, annoying cunt, narcissist in the past hour? 

If you actually read my point, I said that there's a CLEAR cultural difference between how criticisms of players is handled. On /r/soccer there was a thread that discussed this, actually rather well with some GOOD points were both parties mutually agreed that there was differences between the sets of fans - for whatever reasons that may be. That was my only point. I wish I could find the thread, because both sides made some great points as to why that was the case - but that's what I was basing it off. All of my downvote(r)'s that actually explain why they downvoted have been American. Before you say it - it's not hard to click a name and realize by the subs they post in, or terminology/sports they discuss that they are. I am not suggesting ''anyone who disagree's is American'' blindly, so don't try spin it that way either.

My evidence too is the fact that on a primarily English Spurs forum the exact same same statements are made, and there's not this uproar as there is on a primarily American site. Funnily enough on them - they tend to take the same standpoint that I make. That isn't some ''me vs you guys'' bullshit - that's just clear and that was my ONLY point. I even made it clear it doesn't make any difference where you're from when you're supporting the club - it doesn't make your support any better/worse, less or invalid. So please, don't try and turn this into something it isn't. 

&gt;However, you get jumped on because you are a boorish ass who brags out of one side of your mouth and acts like a pathetic victim out of the other

Again, if that was the case - why would I not be on -1000000 karma? It's you who is trying to make this personal today. I've had no problems before, but it seems you and a couple others for whatever reason don't even want to make this about Townsend and now are somehow moving onto some ''bandwagon fan persecution complex'' or something. 

here are some quotes, from a **British site**. That **many agreed** with. Yet here, I'm downvoted. Okay, lets go. 

* I really want him to become good, but if he has another wasteful season of only being able to produce a goal every 50 shots I'm done hoping for him.

* Kid needs to pick his head up and realize that their are other extremely skilled guys on this team like Eriksen and Lamela that he should be looking to get the ball too.

* But I think he lacks the one thing that will hold him back from ever reaching that level. He does not have the right mentality or determination to reach that level. When he plays, he plays like 1 man out of 11 on the pitch rather than as part of a team. 

* I don't rate him, but trying to be optimistic as the new season is just around the corner. Maybe he'll be better on the left as he can't shoot for shit so him cutting inside is pointless.

* I do like Townsend and nothing would please me more than seeing him progress into a really top player as his potential would imply but Pochettino can only help him so far. I unfortunately don't think he has that level of focus in him and think he will be sold by the end of the year.

Coutinho I believe may have the higher ceiling in terms of raw talent but Oscar will always be the overall better player. Oscar is much more complete as a footballer than Coutinho is. Coutinho might have more flair, might develop a better sense of passing, might even get his shot in order to get double digits goals a year, but overall Oscar will always be a more important player to his team. He's much more composed with the ball and has a much more well rounded game.

With that said, Coutinho would have helped us at the WC. Oscar did not play well throughout the tournament. He played well in 1 game, and so-so in another. The rest he was quite shite. But that wasn't all his fault as we lacked a midfield. One thing I wasn't worried about going into the tournament is how our midfield would perform as it was perceived the be our strongest unit. But our midfield and fullbacks were actually the reason we were quite horible throughout the tournament. You can blame Fred all you want but he's not at fault. Was he crap? Yes. But a in the box finisher will never create his own chances. Marcelo/Alves were awful and our Midfield was even worse. Coutinho 'could' have helped, but even if he had went I don't believe he would have played much. Scolari had Hernanes on the bench who is a creative box-to-box midfielder and didn't use him, so I don't feel he would have used Coutinho either. Oscar is not at fault for playing poorly, but play poorly he did. Also, I bet he was quite exhausted after how much he has played in the last 2 years. 

Overall, I prefer Oscar over Coutinho. But also believe this will be a break out year for Liverpool's #10. So we will touch back on this after the season.

 * Scotland will not be able to borrow money at a decent rate, if at all for the foreseeable future. See Argentina. Lenders do not like countries that don't pay their debts.
 * The UK will probably have to shoulder the entirety of the debt, which, without Scotland, will be a higher percentage of the UK's GBP, which will have a knock on effect on the UK's ability to borrow.

I can't say what effect these will have on the Pound, but I suspect it won't be ideal.

This was a discussion on /r/soccer recently too - and **both sets of fans agreed that there is a difference.** I notice you also missed the part where I said regardless of where you're from it doesn't invalidate your support to the club, so good job there. I didn't talk trash - at all. 

I posted in another thread **examples of this actually happening,** rather than me ''blindly trash talking''. These opinions are from one popular mainly **English Spurs forum**, how would they go down here? All of them are recent - I can produce more from other places if you like? 

* I really want him to become good, but if he has another wasteful season of only being able to produce a goal every 50 shots I'm done hoping for him.

* Kid needs to pick his head up and realize that their are other extremely skilled guys on this team like Eriksen and Lamela that he should be looking to get the ball too.

* But I think he lacks the one thing that will hold him back from ever reaching that level. He does not have the right mentality or determination to reach that level. When he plays, he plays like 1 man out of 11 on the pitch rather than as part of a team.

* I don't rate him, but trying to be optimistic as the new season is just around the corner. Maybe he'll be better on the left as he can't shoot for shit so him cutting inside is pointless.

* I do like Townsend and nothing would please me more than seeing him progress into a really top player as his potential would imply but Pochettino can only help him so far. I unfortunately don't think he has that level of focus in him and think he will be sold by the end of the year.

So what? There's no differences? That was the only reason I even mentioned it - not as an insult, not saying Americans aren't aware of football, nothing at all like that - so don't try and spin it that way because you know this board has more Americans so you'll drum up a mass downvote against me. That's just pathetic - truly, it is. I was just highlighting why I probably am receiving downvotes for my perfectly entitled opinions on Townsend on here, when they're shared by OTHER fans.  

EDIT : I would also like to add, I speak too and know many Americans personally that are VERY knowledgeable about Football compared to people I know from around London. So don't get it twisted and try and start something that just isn't there. I also said Yedlin is a great buy because it RAISES OUR PROFILE in America. Why would I care about that if I thought Americans were clueless?

Yes but these literally are the same guys.

Then we switched sides helped them in Libya then helped them again in Syria. And now we've switched again once they began attacking our interests in Iraq. I can't wait for them to take a crack at Iran just to see yet another switch.

We are playing very dangerous games and doing a rather shitty job of it.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"The thing is I've praised Townsend in the past. I even told people he was our ''next Bale'' and told other fans to shut the fuck up about him and he'll come good. But I've watched him pretty closely at his loan spells, and he only really impressed at QPR. He scored a great goal vs Yeovil though in one of his older loan spells. But QPR, Hull - that's about his level, and I'd be happy for 10m - or probably more with the English/Age premium. 

Yes, it's lovely having an academy guy break through. But Caulker went, Livermore went and 10+ million for Townsend is exactly what our academy is for. Yes, it's to produce class players which our next batch are - but it's also to produce EPL/European class players to make a profit on. People need to understand that, and step back and stop being so sentimental about it. Townsend had his chances, he's got some good tools - but he doesn't have it. If he did, he'd be showing a lot more promise than he has an not just one fluke goal last season. He had his chance with Lamela out, and he didn't take it. That's my evidence. We're not in a position to have potentially a 10-15m ''squad player'' sitting on the bench, if we can put that towards making a feared attacking trio of Eriksen - Lamela - ? 

That's my opinion. Until the season starts - I can't be proven right or wrong. Do I want him to be the next Robben AND be loyal to us? Fuck yes, course I do! Why wouldn't I?? But do I see it happening? No, I really don't. Am I some super scout? No. Would I like to do that and am I trying to head that way? Yes...but that's a different story all together.

Bayern does throw around money and buy players! Compared to Dortmund they spend much more money on transfers and on wages. Bayern also does a great job, but they are definitely throwing around money to buy players.

&gt;Really? Bayern always had shitloads of money? Didnt they start like every other club?

I never meant to imply that over their entire history Bayern have always been rich. But they are certainly the richest in Germany now. The certainly have spent the most on transfers in the last five years, and they certainly have the highest wage bill. How is any of that being successful on a budget?

The reason people like Chris Boardman want to improve cycling conditions is so that people exercise more on average, leading to improved health for the nation as a whole. This ties in with reducing traffic and other things - but you have to look at it as the whole package. It very much is about exercise.

Lennon is a player who's strongest asset is his pace and is at his best when he is serving as a disruption to the opposing defense....not creating, not scoring...disruption in order to keep the opposing defence honest.  He is ageing and he seems to have lost a little of his pace, beyond his pace he has never been a creator and he is abysmal at finishing. We don't need a disruptor on the squad, we need someone who can provide more.

So i would have no issue with getting rid of Townsend it just makes more sense to me to prioritize moving someone like Lennon over someone like Andros who will still have *some* value in January or later....i'm not sure Lennon will have value of any type for much longer as he is ageing and carries a higher wage.",0,1407775666,null,0,false,0,cjn79e5,t3_2d882b,t1_cjn79e5,t1_cjn6w56,null,1435183531,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

But I always thought that experience, coaching, leadership, etc would be the keys to improving our defence and I think with a year of the Premier League under the belt of Sakho and the addition and leadership of Lovren, we're going to be in much better shape.

true,scatters,null,null,"&gt; Fine, there are. So what's your point?

If people use the facility, then it was worth constructing, regardless of who doesn't use it.

&gt; Mine is that if the lane is built and adequately does the job - why not use it? Seems there are cyclists out there who don't - and as I said above you can't have it both ways.

Asking for improved dedicated cycling provision while continuing to use the shared carriageway isn't having it both ways.

&gt; What are you expecting?
&gt; The lane I’m thinking of by means of an example is wide, well lit by local street lighting, has zero obstructions (beyond errant pedestrians, though there’s no correlation between cyclists not using the lane and pedestrians being in it). The lane runs parallel to the road with the exact same destination and the safety of not being in a busy arterial road (which also has a bus stop in it!).
&gt; So again, what are you expecting?

I haven't seen your road so I don't know exactly what the issues with it could be. Some considerations: is the cycle lane as flat and smooth as the main carriageway? Is it thoroughly cleaned of debris, water and slippery substances? Is it wide enough to permit cyclists to pass safely at speed (20mph)? Is it physically segregated from pedestrians (it only takes one incident for a cyclist to decide they'd rather take their chances on the main carriageway than risk hitting a vulnerable pedestrian)? Does it have right of way and line of sight over any side roads and entrances? Is it possible to access destinations on both sides of the road without having to slow, stop or dismount? Does it extend the full length of the parallel roadway without gaps? Is it fully signed at eye level and on the ground?

&gt; Generalisation.

Public policy is all about generalisation.

&gt; Perhaps due to lack of options? I've seen plenty that don't like them - myself included.

Yes, ""tolerate"". If they didn't tolerate them they wouldn't be cycling; they'd be complaining about them on the internet.

&gt; Or it tells me something about the mentality of cyclists - plenty of whom remain selfish. These are the ones that weave around pedestrians, cross red lights and zebra crossings, jump at will between cycle lane, road and pavement… the list goes on.

If they're being selfish they must be getting something out of it. I can guarantee they're not cycling on the road just to piss you off.

&gt; You’re quick to blame everything but human error here. It feels like you’re apologising for something.

Human error is when something happens by accident - by mistake. Unless I'm totally misunderstanding, you're saying that people are cycling on the road intentionally.

&gt; You don’t find me saying that the infrastructure is perfect – but I choose my examples carefully. If my example from this morning’s experience was of a cycle lane populated with road works, parked cars and whatever else – I’d surely not use it as it’s an awful example you could easily tear apart. My example stands because it’s so suited to cycling – yet some cyclists would rather jump across a pavement to pull infront of cars on a zebra crossing.

&gt;To be fair, and play Devils Advocate, everyone strengthens every year - and for the past 5, we've finished 4th, 5th, 4th, 5th and 6th (which for all the shit, we were only 3 wins and 1 draw off CL football) despite that. With arguably weaker ''balanced'' teams, while making 40m NET profit on transfers in that time and also the 5th highest TV money last season. We're just as ''best off'' as the other 6 listed.

&gt;On paper I would say now we have the best manager we've had in years, a mix of Man Management/Motivation, EPL Proven Tactics, Great with Youth and real Football Experience. 'Arry, AVB and Tactics Tim all lacked at least one of those key aspects. On paper I would say we have the most balanced team now we've had in years - and we've arguably had our ''replace our star'' player season now that Liverpool will go through with Suarez and signing players.

&gt;Looks a bit different then, doesn't it? LvG is literally only human and for all his ''first season'' successes it could backfire spectacularly. We also made ''strong signings'' last season, beating Liverpool to them last year and they finished 2nd and we finished 6th. I feel like Liverpool will do a Spurs this year. The rest? Everyone strengthens every year, like I said. Every season it's ''fuck, xxx got xxx player, we're screwed!''. Fuck, Chelsea got Shevchenko! Fuck, Chelsea got Torres! Fuck, Chelsea got Costa! You can see where I'm going with this. Providing we can improve our results against them and more importantly the teams below us, we'll be fine. It's always been small point differences, we're never 15/20 points off CL football even last year. If we can stamp out games where we've thrown away 1-0 leads vs Everton to a 2-1 loss in injury time, or collapsed against West Ham then we'll be fine.

&gt;I remember last season we had by far the most key players out injured by minutes. Arsenal argue it's them by a tiny margin (as always), but we lost more key players - Diaby for them doesn't count. And also Spurs committed 21 errors that lead to a goal in the PL last season; more than Cardiff, Hull, Newcastle, Chelsea and WBA combined (20).

Now you ask where does the food come from, lots of it is imported. Clothing have you looked at the tag recently, I can't remember the last time I saw made in Britain. Energy, once again much is imported, North Sea oil and gas production peaked in 1999. Electronics, yer we don't make thoses. 

I haven't even mentioned personal debt levels, given an extra £100 a week many people would pay off their debts right? So have does that help the economy? It's doesn't you're effectively just paying for people's poor financial chooses and misallocating resources. 

We're running a trade deficit of 3-5% of GDP. So I large percentage of that money would leave the country. Making us poorer not richer. You have to invest money to make money not spend it.  Giving people money doesn't make them richer, especially when we are devaluing the pound to pay for it. It just means the cost of living goes up as well as the debt burden on their children.  

Your right austerity doesnt work in the sense that over spending for 50 years means you can't continue that lifestyle you've become a custom too.  So what can we do, we can cut back a lot, deregulate employment laws to make us more competitive with emerging markets (yes they're be hardship) or keeping going at we are with massive debt, cheap bubble creating credit from the Bank of England, devaluing of the pound leading to hyper inflation. You can't argue with maths no matter how much you try, we'll pay up either way.  We need foreign investment in productive money making output not just speculative markets like the London housing market. At the minute there's better places for an investor to put there money we need to change that. 

I'm sorry for being ranting but anyone that simply says austerity bad borrowing more good, has no idea of the underlying concepts and consequence of that.  Basic economics and history.

Can't help but feel that you know what my point was, seeing as you offered a counterpoint, and that you're basically just being a dick about it. But I guess I'll try to look past your demeanor.

I can't think of any journey that I've had to regularly make on foot in the last 28 years that I would describe as ""inconvenient"" besides being inconvenient in the sense that walking is slower than driving - I'm not sure any amount of budgetary shifting is going to change that I'm afraid. I can walk anywhere I'd need to walk as directly, often more so, than local roads can offer. If absolutely nothing else, most of the time I can just walk alongside the pavement that is right next to the goddamn roads I would otherwise be driving along anyhow - often however, there is an even more direct route by foot.

More safe I can understand, in terms of night lighting perhaps, but I wouldn't exactly describe it as something that's in contention with the national transport budget - fairly sure that spending would come under local authority renovations and improvements.

And, like you say, most of the transport budget goes on motoring, but mainly because it's the mode of transport most people use most commonly - more relevantly perhaps, it also happens to be the most costly infrastructure to construct and maintain (out of the three modes we're talking about, anyhow). You could prioritise creating cycling routes until you're blue in the face, it's still going to cost you three extra mountains of gold to build a motorway than it's going to cost you to build an array of cycling routes. So actually, yeah, I'm going to say that complaining that 
&gt;Pretty much all the transport budget goes on motoring

doesn't make a whole lot of sense, unless you actually ARE saying that ""NO money should be spent on it"". Because... otherwise, guess what? It's still always going to be the most expensive item by far, which returns us to my original point that using the cost of maintaining roads as a basis for comparison because it's the most expensive item is still ridiculous, because it always will be.",0,1407776227,null,0,1407776610,0,cjn7kdc,t3_2d7wh5,t1_cjn7kdc,t1_cjn6grp,null,1435183673,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,RandomHigh,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt; Remember, the CI doesn't just get paid to sewer cleaners and shelf-stackers. It gets paid to lawyers and doctors too. 

Under my system, it wouldn't be paid to anyone with a job. It would simply be a replacement for unemployment/disability/pension benefits. As soon as you get a job you CI payments stop.

If you have over £10,000 in your bank account (£17,500 for couples, with an extra £1,000 per child) your payments stop, regardless of your lack of employment.

As I said, the system is supposed to be a safety net, and not paid out to people who don't need it. My version of a CI system wouldn't pay anyone who didn't need it, but would pay out to anyone who did need it regardless of their ability/willingness to work or not. 

Which is why my amount the person receives in cash would be lower. It's still pushing people to want to work to have a better quality of life, but I would make damned sure the poorest of society still got their money without some cunt-bag in the job centre sanctioning them for not turning up to an appointment that was changed without their knowledge.

The bureaucracy for all of this would actually be massively reduced. Without the need for weekly/fortnightly renewals and proof of looking for work, the DWP could make massive layoffs, which is why I think any idea like this will have a huge push back by the unions due to the loss of several hundreds of thousands of staff.

I would streamline the process and retrain a lot of their staff and procedures to a simple form which stated that they would like to enrol in the program, and then allow the government access to their bank account to calculate their income needs. (something which is already on a lot of benefits forms in small print, but re-worded as a way to check for benefit fraud. Basically, if you're claiming any form of benefit, you grant the government access to your account to verify you're not committing fraud.)

If the person has no income for that week, pay them the full amount.

If the person has partial income from that week from part time work, make up the difference.

If the person has over the allowed amount in savings, pay no income.

If the person has more than their allowed amount coming in that week, pay no income.

Now I'm no computer genius, but I'm sure that this process could easily be automated to be around 98% efficient.

The 2% would be for people living on the edge with a borderline amount of savings, which is why there wouldn't be a complete layoff of all DWP staff.

According to an article from the BBC last year, DWP staff handle about 3.6 million new claims for jobseeker's allowance every year.

E.g. there is one point in the 1st half where dortmund just got a corner, and we were under pressure. The ball was played into our goal, and was semi-cleared to a dortmund player just outside our box, and the first thing Lovren did was to wave his arms to push the line up because he realized we were sitting too deep. The idea is to force the dortmund player who were loitering in the box for their corner to push out else they'll be offside when the ball played back in -- this has the effect of forcing the dortmund players into a semi-disorganize phase and also allow us the defending side to narrow the space between the last line of defense and the ball. The funny thing is that as he push the line up, Skrtel hesitated (his problem has been that he drops too deep).

Throughout, Lovren was nowhere near the ball, but this kind of organization is one reason why he is going to displace Agger.

I think all of us (fans) need to realize something. We are currently not a top 4 team, and we need to stop thinking we are realistically contending for it.

Moving forward four out of City, United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool are the favorites to get top 4 every single year. Any instance where one of those five teams don't get CL is an aberration.

We made CL once, and we should be thrilled we were there and had the great run that we did. But to expect that again right now, or even say its a realistic goal is only setting up for failure. The ""problem"" is that we were so agonizingly close for a few years, and this has led to a new mentality. We achieved that on the back of some amazing true world class players we no longer have (for now its only Hugo &amp; Jan. Eriksen is not quite there yet, but close).

Yes, it is and should be a club-wide goal, but not a realistic one for right now. Once stadium money comes in (and we're not buckled by paying it off), then maybe (!!) this story changes. That is probably a decade away. 
[KEY]: Whether we like it or not the power structures have changed in the PL, we were passed by, and its gonna take time to alter it again.

We need to set up clear long term goals: 
1. Continue to progress every year
2. Set up a clear manner of play throughout all levels of the club and enforce it so that the youth seamlessly slide in to the first team
3. Establish solid continuity in our management
4. Don't let the talent/wealth/etc. gap increase between us and the top 5. Bare minimum, keep it the status quo.
5. Make Tottenham a destination club, not a stepping stone to a larger venue.

With those goals in mind - set up short term goals:
1. Win a cup or the Europa
2. Don't sell our most talented players just to restart the system again.


TL;DR: There never should have been pressure in the first place - we're exactly where we should be right now given the league structure. We should continue to progress with all the new players and management, and if we contend top 4 that is only icing on the cake.

It seems clear you don't work with money. A grand majority of building projects work on the premise that someone will be used enough to warrant its building. Don't believe me? Tell me this...

...if you read in the papers that our government had just spent several million pounds on a new stretch of road that was used by 10 people in one year and it was *not* a necessity to build it - would you deem it worth building? 

Value for money. It is a factor, like it or not. 

&gt; Asking for improved dedicated cycling provision while continuing to use the shared carriageway isn't having it both ways.

It's exactly having it both ways. Why ask for dedicated cycling provision - which costs money - then continue to use the shared carriageway instead? 

That's like a child asking for a new toy then leaving it alone and only playing with the old ones - what a waste! 

&gt; is the cycle lane as flat and smooth as the main carriageway? Is it thoroughly cleaned of debris, water and slippery substances? Is it wide enough to permit cyclists to pass safely at speed (20mph)? Is it physically segregated from pedestrians (it only takes one incident for a cyclist to decide they'd rather take their chances on the main carriageway than risk hitting a vulnerable pedestrian)? Does it have right of way and line of sight over any side roads and entrances? Is it possible to access destinations on both sides of the road without having to slow, stop or dismount? Does it extend the full length of the parallel roadway without gaps? Is it fully signed at eye level and on the ground?

Yes. Seriously. All of the above. The *only* exception will be the physical segregation of pedestrians and cyclists and as I was the only pedestrian on that pavement *and* facing the cyclist *and* stood entirely still, well away from where he would pass me - you'd be hard pressed to point at that as your factor.

I cycle as well. I wouldn't pick this example if I wasn't 100% sure of the weirdness of having the option but not using it. 

&gt; Public policy is all about generalisation.

Actually it's about a number of things. If we found more black people committed crimes than white people - we wouldn't suddenly find ourselves all in favour of clamping down on black people in this country, would we? No. We would not. 

&gt; Yes, ""tolerate"". If they didn't tolerate them they wouldn't be cycling; they'd be complaining about them on the internet.

Plenty of people complain about incidents whilst driving on the internet but go right back out on the roads. This doesn't hold water either. 

&gt; If they're being selfish they must be getting something out of it. 

They are - in the case of red lights and zebra crossings they're not having to slow down and lose time / energy on their journeys at the cost of safety to others (having nearly been hit three times in the last 6 months by cyclists whilst I crossed pedestrian crossings in my favour - I know what I'm talking about here). 

Does that make it OK? *Hell. No.*

&gt; Human error is when something happens by accident - by mistake. Unless I'm totally misunderstanding, you're saying that people are cycling on the road intentionally.

You are - I'm questioning not using the infrastructure - if someone makes a concious decision to do that then it's still human error. Human error can lead to accidents and certainly doesn't explain this. 

&gt; Have you thought why?

Yes. You won't like it. It's because they're fucking idiots. 

I say that *as a cyclist*. I do practice what I preach - I don't hop red lights or zebra crossings or weave on pavements amongst pedestrians. These are dangerous things and I have no sympathy for those that do them or their complaints - they're essentially saying 'I'm selfish, deal with what I choose to do' and they would likely be the first to cry out if a motorist did the same and inconvenienced them with a dangerously close overtaking manoeuvre for example.

Both clubs want to buy the best players they can get.

&gt; But they're the richest team in BuLi that does it, so they have poached the highest profile players.

Obviously. Why should they buy players which wouldnt improve their squad?

&gt;Bayern does throw around money and buy players! Compared to Dortmund they spend much more money on transfers and on wages. 

True. They got more money and got higher wages because they got better players.

&gt;but they are definitely throwing around money to buy players.

I never said Bayern doesnt throw around money.

Every club does it, but everyone only rants about Bayern doing it while Dortmund does the same thing.

Dortmund got less money but still throw around money. Dortmunds got limited possibilities but they do the same as Bayern, Bayern got more money, but its is basically the exact same thing.

&gt;But they are certainly the richest in Germany now. The certainly have spent the most on transfers in the last five years, and they certainly have the highest wage bill. How is any of that being successful on a budget?

Why should Bayern be successful on a budget? Bayern is too good to have a small budget.

You blame Bayern because they did a great job over the last decades and got a lot of money?


Back to the comment that started the whole argument

&gt;I think it's just the typical sides being taken between a Galactico-type club and a club that buys smart, young and produces stars.

We agree that both Bayern and Dortmund throw around money and poach players from worse teams? Right? Good!

And both clubs do a good youth work. As I wrote above, Bayern did a better youth work than Dortmund. They produced way more and way better stars.


&gt;I think it's just the typical sides being taken between a Galactico-type club and a club that buys smart, young and produces stars.

So why would anyone make such a statement if both clubs do the same thing?

He either doesnt know what hes talking about, probably because everyone keeps repeating such statements

or to hate on Bayern for, obviously, no reason.

And thats what annoys me.

Inside of our own country, this doesn't work on an international scale at all. Which most pharma is.

&gt; It would also solve a problem where companies try to game the system by not seeking licenses for drugs which would take market share from other drugs they own

Far enough, but then again, if pharma was nationalised we might not continue research into an area where there was a solution that is deemed good enough.

&gt; It also solves a philosophical issue of research funding - since the UK government pays for a huge amount of UK pharma research

Do we have any number on how much many is made back in tax by selling the product of that research to other nations and health organisations? Probably more than it costs as well as ensure that research continues to be done in UK rather than in cheaper countries.

The bottom line however is how do you intend to do it, are you just going to nationalised Astrazeneca or GSK. They are private companies. If you nationalise them, then what, what if I come up with a good idea for a drug and want to spawn my own company, I am not allowed to because I would be in competition with the state?

MSc degrees for international students like yourself are going to be **very** expensive. By way of example, for my MSc, the fees were £3,900 for Home students, £9,000 for rUK (rest of the UK) and £12,000 for international students. Scholarships are available for international students, but they are exceptionally competitive and may not cover the entire cost. Many international scholarships are also aimed at students from the Commonwealth.

To be honest, I'd look at the US if you want to do an MSc/MLitt (or whatever) abroad, as it has more ties with Mexico, and you're likely to find more scholarships aimed at Mexicans. The US actually has a better system of funding postgraduate degrees, i.e. you can work as a research/teaching assistant in exchange for a stipend. This isn't really possible in the UK because there simply isn't time - our masters degrees are normally 12 months long and there isn't much time to do additional work.

p.s. There's a reason that the UK is nicknamed 'Rip-off Britain'.

Lamela and Lennon can interchange. And I'm happy to sub Townsend for Lennon. But for now I think Lennon really suits the system Poch is implementing. I'd probably say Holtby over Eriksen just now as I think Eriksen has been slower to fit the system and Holtby provides a great deal of energy despite his comparative weaknesses.  

Mason was one of our best performers in pre-season and has more than earned his chance at a first team place, especially against West Ham. A lot of you are saying Holtby as a deeper Midfielder, and whilst I think his energy can be just as well spent in the centre, he's always been an attacking midfielder.

I'd keep Ade rested for a while. You can see that a great player is still there but I'd give him a little more time to get his fitness back. I'd put Kane on the Bench for now, like Holtby he provides a lot of energy and that could be valuable as a sub.

- I want to see Davies and Rose push each other when they get their opportunities so left back turns from our weak link to a source of strength.
- I want one of our many CMs to make a leap to Eriksen's level.

League:

- I think Chelsea is running away with the league, but I hope if Spurs and United can at least average 1.5 points (WL) from each of the other Top 5 sides from 2013, that it's plausible that Arsenal, Spurs, United, Liverpool, and Everton could be a toss up for any positions from 3rd through 7th.

It suits the rich to be able to make foreign property investments (hedges not only against the stock market, but against other currencies), and this is presented as injections of foreign money coming into our economy.

''if he has another wasteful season of only being able to produce a goal every 50 shots I'm done hoping for him'' - well, I have been downvoted for saying that, a lot. On other forums? Agreed opinion. That's the difference that I'm trying to make.
