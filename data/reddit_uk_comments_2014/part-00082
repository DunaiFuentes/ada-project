A lot of these terms are used very differently in different parts of the world.  ""Paki"" is only really used in the UK as far as I know.  In South Africa, ""coloured"" is the standard term used for a particular ethnic group, whereas in the US, my understanding is that ""colored"" is a slightly gauche and old-fashioned term for minorities in general, whereas ""people of color"" is completely acceptable.

The meaning and acceptability of words is determined by their usage, not by their origins or spelling.  The word ""Jewish"" is less problematic than ""Jew"" because ""Jew"" gets used as a slur and is popular among anti-semites.

It's a similar reason as to why some transexuals prefer to be termed 'trans women' and 'trans men', not 'transwomen' transmen'. The first is inclusive and generalising, the second can be seen as exclusive and objectifying. 

There's also the issue of 'coloured people' having been used in the first half of the 20th Century in racist contexts. There's no ignoring the fact that words have histories, and some words that seem innocuous can be intensely offensive depending on their past use.

Instead we had a special interest group take, by force, control of the country.

In the UK we have special interest groups marching in parliament all the time. Thank God they don't physically abuse our police and chase our parliamentary members. Because the whole country deserves a say on who is in parliament - not just some hot headed loudmouths!

Do I wish some politicians would get booted out of office? Sure. And I take every opportunity to make it so at election time.

Was shooting protesters extreme? Isn't that for courts to decide? I'm sure if some of those arsonists at the London summer riots were shot the police would have been investigated and probably cleared of wrong doing.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"&gt; I just didn't explain it properly. The chances he gets are ones that fall to him, it's not ones he makes himself like Schurrle.

Sorry but that's a very poor rationalization. You cannot claim that the chances a player gets are due to luck and not down to the player's own movement. If Willian never crossed the half-way line for 90 minutes then I would agree with you.

Perhaps what you're referring to is Schurrle's runs trying to beat the off-side trap. If that's what you are referring to, then I agree that Schurrle makes himself available to an attacking pass, but again, that is only because he plays as a RW rather than a RM, and playing in that position tends to leave a gap between him and the RB (Ivanovic), which Ivanovic then has to try to close down while also trying to be defensively aware and it creates an imbalance in the system. 

Also, a Willian tends to drift into the middle trying to create chances rather than latching onto chance to score. Hence why Schurrle gets more chances than Willian, and more clear cut chances.

&gt;I've seen Hazard do it, Oscar do it, even Ivanovic.

Yes but not at the same frequency. In fact Oscar barely ever commits himself to attack that anymore.

&gt; Well like you said yourself, Willian cost Â£30m. You don't pay that much for a bench player. 

Shevchenko.

&gt;Also he adapted better than Schurrle but now Schurrle is playing the way Jose wants.

Only reason Schurrle is playing right now is because both Willian and Ramires are suspended. Expect Willian to be back in the lineup next week.

&gt;I still don't see how it hampers his attacking ability, I agree he won't have as much freedom as before at Shakhtar but his ability in the final third should still be the same regardless of what role he plays. You don't see Luiz or Cahill consistently scuffing shots or failing to make that final pass when their in and around the box because they have been defending for long periods of the game, so why is Willian different?

Firstly, I'm not sure what chances you're talking about that he's fluffed. He hasn't had as many chances fall to him because he just doesn't play that high up the pitch and tends to arrive late unless we're countering, in which case he is always a part of the attack that tends to score goals. The one thing I will say is he doesn't tend to take it upon himself to make the final pass, which is a different issue altogether. That sort of responsibility comes the more you settle into a club so I'm not surprised that he's not willing to take many risks, especially if it would mean giving the ball away.",0,1395528241,null,0,false,0,cg9cim4,t3_212rji,t1_cg9cim4,t1_cg94fj9,null,1433024032,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Perhaps when you are done tearing down the Londoncentric politicians ruining the UK you can concentrate on those EU cretins in their Brussels bubble, and tell them that each member MEP should be thinking about their country and not the Brussel bubble where policy and politics is decided for the benefit of Belgium and not the member countries (i feel i need to tell you Brussels is in Belgium because your ignorance displayed so far is so shocking it wouldn't surprise me if you didn't know this, i also feel i need to tell you i am not talking about the vegetable either , as someone of your ""calibre"" is so easily confused ).

And that's fine but I don't think Sherwood will ever make that happen, meaning Soldado playing up on his own at the moment is pretty much worthless. I have nothing against him and I want him to succeed, and I'm hoping that whatever coach we bring in in the summer can make that happen. I just don't see it happening now, and don't want to risk slipping up even more the rest of this season attempting to make it happen when Kane is more than capable of covering for Ade as we saw against Benfica.

There is no objective way to decide who was the ""greatest"" scientist of the past century, and Einstein was just one person.  This is like arguing that white people are inherently the most evil because Hitler was white.  Also, apparently Jewish people didn't do that well in IQ tests in the early twentieth century (at least in America - I don't know if there is any evidence from Germany).  Over the last century, the social status of Jewish people has improved, so they have become wealthier and better educated, and now achieve relatively high IQ scores.

&gt; If the tests favour a specific culture then shouldn't they favour the culture of the people who made the tests?

Well, in general.  If a particular skill is considered to be important in your culture, then you are more likely to include it in an IQ test.

Soldado pretty much ONLY played as a lone striker at Valencia, where he did it perfectly.  The difference is that Valencia had a creative, fluid attacking side, where he got regular service through and behind opposition back lines, where he could thrive with his accurate poaching instincts.

Since coming here, he hasn't had anything like that.  We struggle to play through teams, and even though we have a plethora of wingers, we struggle to get wide and around the fullbacks.  Instead, we have now given up and just lump long balls forward in some vague hope that Adebayor will single-handedly do something with it.  Soldado was never going to thrive in that kind of attacking mentality.

His form is the overarching failure of AVB, who kept playing him despite not having a system that even vaguely supported Bobby.  AVB effectively played him out of form, and he still hasn't recovered.

true,MadArend,num20,,"I'd say this is probably the best we can do, unless Walker passes his late fitness test before the game.

Good point about Sandro -- he's already started 4 games in the past 15 days, playing 330+ minutes in that time.  Rest him if possible, especially since he may well be our most important player against Liverpool next week.  Tim just has to make sure Bentaleb knows his primary job -- break up counterattacks (since I presume Soton will play organized defense and look to hit us on the break).

I like Fryers at LB for his defensive discipline, but only if Chadli or Townsend is playing left.  If Tim goes 4-4-2 with Eriksen on the left, then we'll need Rose for width (which makes this a terrible idea overall -- just play an actual LW, please).

The main issue I see with this formation is on the right side.  Naughton, despite being a decent defender, simply does *not* have the pace to make overlapping runs like Walker.  He gets burned for pace against every winger he meets -- his defensive solidity depends on positioning.  If he tries to make attacking runs towards the byline, we will get destroyed down that side if whenever we lose the ball.  Now, against Arsenal, Naughton was able to stay further back because Townsend mostly kept his width -- the first time Andros has done that on the right side all season.  If Andros does that again, Naughton will do fine.  Hell, on that note, if he and everyone else plays like they did against Arsenal, we'll almost certainly win the game.  

I just worry that if Andros reverts back to the cut-in wide forward play that he's shown on the right side in the past, either we'll become really unbalanced or we'll be really vulnerable on counters.",0,1395531652,null,0,1395551515,0,cg9dsgr,t3_213dtn,t1_cg9dsgr,t3_213dtn,null,1433024695,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

true,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"&gt;What do you mean we don't have the calibre for a 4-4-2? Are you saying that our midfielders aren't good enough individually or our team doesn't play that way?

Both. Though I think the 4-4-2 is a bad idea for most teams, anyway, considering the way most teams are set up these days.

The 4-4-2 would be a failure for Villa in the same way it is a failure for England. We simply cannot control possession (particularly in midfield) in that way. It has been proven time and time again this season. It was attempted with a three man central midfield against West Ham and backfired spectacularly. No reason to think we can pull it off with a two man central midfield.

Your assertion that the 4-4-2 would strengthen us defensively is naive at best and downright ignorant at worst. The 4-3-3 Lambert uses at Villa is a primarily defensive system that effectively becomes a full-team press, with nine men actively playing defensive roles when not in possession. How is this at a disadvantage when compared to a 4-4-2, other than in space coverage (which is redundant considering the work rate of our wide forwards)?

Why would the 4-4-2 open us up, you ask? Well, for a start, we'd have less presence in the centre of midfield -- and by extension, either increased vulnerability to counters if one of them presses forward to support attacks. Our generally poor ball retention would make this a serious concern for me. Think about it like this... if Westwood and Delph are playing in the middle in a 4-4-2 and Delph pushes forward and loses the ball (as much as I love Fabs, this is likely)... do you honestly think Westwood can hold down the midfield on his own against a counter through the middle? Because that's what would happen. Successful 4-4-2 systems always have an enforcer. We don't.

Even assuming Westwood/Delph works as the centre pairing in a 4-4-2, the system still wouldn't work well because we still wouldn't be able to unlock a stubborn defence. And if we did bring in a creative player to unlock defences, where would he play? Off the striker, dropping deep? isn't that a 4-4-1-1 .. or, more accurately, basically the defensive phase of a 4-3-3 system? So yeah... even the ability to switch to a 4-4-2 mid-game isn't that important. The only situation I can think of in which the ability to switch to a 4-4-2 is useful for Villa is if the opposition goes a man down... and even then, not really necessary.

I don't understand the obsession with the 4-4-2. Literally no English club has achieved notable success in recent years using it. The last Villa manager to try it has the worst record of ANY Villa manager in history... So why would we want to use it now?

The reason the 4-3-3 is our best formation this season is precisely BECAUSE it is flexible. It's not predictable in and of itself. If we're predictable this season it's because we don't have that link player I talked about. So everyone knows we have to rely on counters. You put a creative player in the mix and all of a sudden you can't predict how we'll attack next time.

tl;dr There are several very good reasons Lambert doesn't play a 4-4-2.",0,1395532509,null,0,false,0,cg9e48j,t3_20p9jp,t1_cg9e48j,t1_cg998vq,null,1433024850,0,false,avfc,t5_2s569,0

Longer? Well, depends how much work you want to take on.  The average student takes something like eight years, but that's because most people fit it around a family and/or full-time job.  I started in 2009 and will have a physics degree by the end of this year and a maths degree by the end of next.  I was working more or less full-time for a lot of it but lately prefer to work part time and tutor some maths to pay the rent.  If you have enough spare time you could feasibly finish the degree in three years, but you will be very busy.

Cheaper?  Well, depends on where you live.  If you have low/zero income it will mostly be paid for anyway, but if you are paying for your own then doing it in England will be prohibitively expensive.  I live in Wales and it costs me less than a third of what it would cost someone over the border.  I get some courses paid but because I was studying multiple courses at once I also had to pay some of my own.  One problem is that because OU is always classed as part-time (regardless of how many courses you're actually doing), you cannot currently qualify for student loans.  I heard that might be changing, but I don't know enough to advise you on that.

I would refer you to /r/openuniversity but it's totally dead.  There are *loads* of Facebook groups and Twitter channels where people would be happy to offer advice, though.

If you wanted to go with the OU, I'd advise trying to get a part time job; enough to support yourself but not enough to take you over the financial support threshold (16,000 when last I checked, but has probably increased a little).  And if you can, move to Wales or Scotland!  If you have to pay for your own courses you can probably save a couple thousand a year by relocating.

true,mao_was_right,cnty-wales,poverty,"&gt; 'People of colour' presupposes that they're people first, coloured second. 'Coloured people' puts the seperating classification of 'coloured' as the most pressing issue.

I've heard this one before. 'People of colour' doesn't make colour any less the main descriptor than 'coloured people' does. 'People' is the noun, not the adjective. It's just another way of saying exactly the same thing. Unless the point is that there is some (purely psychological) difference in having the word 'people' appear in the sentence before the word 'colour' does (in which case I would question the wisdom of deciding rules on the structure of language based on people's feelings), both phrases parse the same: people that are coloured.

&gt;There's no ignoring the fact that words have histories, and some words that seem innocuous can be intensely offensive depending on their past use. 

No doubt. What I don't see is how you can make the term 'coloured people' any less offensive by just changing the order of the words. You're still saying the same words, with the same meaning.

We're not talking about creating language rules for an imagined language here.

It's not about how the phrase parses, it's about the connotations and assumptions it evokes when used as part of a public living language used by a huge variety of people of different backgrounds.

I think the placement of 'people' as the primary indicator is of great significance. It does not change the technical meaning of the phrase, as you pointed out.

OK, people should be able to believe what they want, but in a secular society it's pretty worrying to see any encroachment of religion into law.

I know we're all worried about anti Muslim discrimination, but if this was evangelical Christians instead of Muslim religious conservatives, would you really still think that there's no problem?

true,[deleted],null,null,"I agree - my grandparents gave me my ""inheritance"" (despite them being alive at the time) when I was around 14. It was Â£14k, and I still have Â£10k left after having bought a car, doing a bit of travelling (supported by my entire family because my grandparents loved travelling), put down a deposit for an apartment and all that kind of stuff for university. In my case my mum never really had control of it, it was straight from my grandparents to me, but I was taught quite strongly growing up what was worth spending savings on. 

As a mostly unemployed student, I can't get a mortgage or even a loan for a car or anything, and I don't want to use credit for anything, so to me it's okay for ""big"" things like cars or necessary/emergency things like a new laptop when my old one broke to come out of savings with the idea that I gradually pay myself back when I have the money, but for little things like clothes and socialising, that has to come out of my small income and student grant and stuff.

At the minute I feel really uncomfortable with it being at Â£10k because I feel like I did spend a bit too much this year even though it was relatively important stuff, so I'm taking money out of my current account every few months and putting in a few hundred at a time. I've also been looking for actual jobs, and the way my finances are at the minute, I'd be able to put almost all the money I earn back into savings, with the hopes of having a decent deposit on a house in a few years.

I'm only 19, and have had access to that much money for five years and almost all that I've spent of it has been in the last year because of moving out for university.

 and you have the arrogance and stupidity to think you know more than me regarding legislation and policy wrt to government and economics.

this genuinely is what i enjoy about reddit so much, absolutely uninformed and idiotic people who think they are experts . but actually know very very little and lack the ability to even understand the concept.


I'm sure your video/photography background and your psychology education gives you a real valid insight into the complexities of optimal systems of governments.

i suppose you think its my loss that you will not engage me politically (lol), suppose its my loss that the dustman doesn't inform me of medical advice also.

Democracy like the type i want works fine in Switzerland, and other countries.

It would work fine in the UK too.

The public isn't stupid. And even if they are, it is their choice to decide what happens to *their* country.

You really are no better than Stalin and his pals, or Hitler and his buddies.

true,bunjog,eng-wiltshire,Wiltshire,"&gt; Does this mean 'people who are coloured' is not offensive either?

That's obviously the most important question, and I guess there's no objective answer. Some people might be offended that we still classify people based on their skin colour, however we phrase it. But others would be offended if we were to 'whitewash' that particularly aspect of identity. I personally think that we're not at the stage where we can wholly remove reference to skin colour when talking about identity, and the best we can do is broach it in terms that are acceptable for everyone.  

The term 'people of colour' is actually an American one, that got picked up to replace 'minorities' in public life, after the the huge increase of Latino/coloured populations. Martin Luther King used 'citizens of colour' in his 'I have a dream' speech. So in the American context it has a very specific association with the civil rights movement and the increasing prominence of 'non-white' culture. Taken out of that context, I actually agree with you, it's a matter of personal opinion whether 'person of colour' is less offensive than 'coloured person'. 

&gt; there is no 'privilege' of words in the phrase anywhere other than people's own minds

I 100% agree. 'Person of colour' is an artificial construction taken up with the specific aim of distancing itself from descriptors with rascist over-tones. I don't think it has to make entirely logical sense. It's part of the 'ferris wheel of euphemisms' if you will, previously, nigger has been acceptable, then negro, then black person, now people of colour. I'm sure in 15 years time when our perception of racial identity has shifted again there will be another term adopted and 'people of colour' and its connotations will be discarded.

Whilst enthusiasm is a good thing, it makes me facepalm somewhat how delusional it is at times. We are pretty poor away from home (1 win in the last 6), especially recently, and we have two tricky games coming up. Newcastle who always give us a hard game (even if we have edged results lately), and Fulham- who are fighting for survival... Yet it seems the general consensus is brushing over these with an attitude of 'when rather than if we win'... In honestly 4 points from those 2 games would not be bad at all. 

It seems this attitude is prevent online, but every single Evertonian I know in person would laugh at the implication that we could take over Arsenal. Maybe it is a 'new supporter' thing, or maybe people are less fearful of being optimistic when they are anonymous.

Unfortunately he will probably never have done that before and in drafting it he could make a mistake in the wording which causes ambiguity later. Presumably these guidelines are there to stop ambiguity among the wills of Muslims who go to lawyers and tell them to draft their wills in ways the Western lawyer might not be familiar with; to help avoid mistake and costly court cases where two parties go to court because the wording of the will is confusing. None of it is actually part of English law in any way.

Now it looks as though we'll be playing in the Champions League so that means rotation for matches in the FA Cup, League Cup, and Premier League matches the weekend before a CL match. That being said, that's realistically speaking at best only another 15 or so matches. I think Agger is more likely to leave, but Lucas will have to decide whether or not he's comfortable being mainly backup for Gerrard.  I'm just saying I won't be suprised if bids come in for Agger and Lucas over the summer.

Sahko &amp; Skrtel are the obvious CB partnership for me. Agger, as loyal as he is, just isn't all that great in my opinion.

if Glen Johnson can keep playing like he did against United &amp; Cardiff I'd be happy for him to stay and earn that new contract, if not him I was always very impressed by Adam Matthews at Celtic. Kept Pedro/Sanchez quiet when Barca visited Scotland in the CL past couple of occasions. He'd be an interesting acquisition. Either Martin Kelly is finished or Rodgers is doing what he did with Skrtel and letting him take notes and develop.

Finally, Gerrard's been amazing at the 'Quarterback' position, but he's bad defensively. He's been at fault for most of the goals we've conceded since he moved into that position. Yann M'Vila or Morgan Schneiderlin would be my ideal replacements in a defensive role. (trying to take into account its unlikely Gerrard will be able to play every game next season with the CL)

I don't think it's realistic to achieve 4th in general. 

And to answer a few of your points from the first comment:

1) I think Swansea are a really good team, and they were playing great today. I actually follow Swansea almost consistently, you pointed out their table position and I don't think that their score has reflected their performances. Especially today, I think w were out ready to win and they messed us up with their pace and drive. I don't think we were expecting that. 
2) I was calling it a meltdown not because of the scoreline (you compared it to the man city game) but because of the way they played. They were totally out of it, giving the ball away constantly, making easy mistakesâ the man city games was both teams putting it out there. This was Arsenal asleep and Chelsea dancing on top of them. Both have very different implications.

Again, I didn't say ""HEY GUYS WE""RE GOING TO CHAMPIONS LEAGUE NOW,"" as many people are implying / making fun of. I said that 1) we can beat newcastle, 2) we can beat fulham, 3) we can tie arsenal, and 4) arsenal may lose to swansea and probably will to man city. 

none of those things are super far fetched, except maybe the swansea claim, but you just said that we may find fulham hard to beat because they're fighting relegation, and then you totally disregarded that same logic when discussing swansea vs arsenal.

Honestly, and as much as it pains me to say this due to my family ties to the city, but Sunderland aren't staying up. Yes they have two games in hand and only 3 points back, but they just don't have it in them at the moment. I've lost count of the number of reds they've had this year (Alonso got another today) and their good run of form from January/February seems long gone. They play the likes of us, City and Chelsea away from home still as well and their home form has been absolutely abysmal this season.

Fab isn't staying there once they go down. He's too good for the Championship these days. He'll be back with us anyway and I highly doubt Brendan will sell him.

true,hardcorelawnwee,,I don't have a bike,"Just been going through this ordeal recently (although not exactly successfully, but I've now got all the info). I went to view a SV650s and made an offer on it a couple of weekends ago but I was beaten to it and the bike was sold to a higher bidder.
Recently passed my A2 and obviously I want to upgrade from my 125 and there are only a few bikes that don't need restricting. I was initially determined to get one of these to save costs...but they are either new and expensive (cb500(r/f/x), 390 duke, xt660x etc) or older and hard to come by in good condition (Gs500 etc).
Anyway after seeing a couple of crap Gs500's I saw a SV650s and I was instantly in love. Before making the owner an offer, I wanted to find out about restrictor kit prices and fitting so I could get a good idea of how much I'd need. I went to a couple of showrooms and a bike garage and found out you need the official restrictor kit from FI international (Google it) they have the prices for each kit on there. The sv650's is Â£180 as it's the ecu kinda type of restrictor kit, takes 15 mins to fit (has to be done by a trained mechanic and paperwork sent off/stickers placed on the machine) so would cost an hours labour (usually Â£40 quid). So essentially altogether about Â£220. The bike details are updated by the dvla and is officially restricted to 46.6bhp. If the police pull you over you should be fine as it comes up on their systems as restricted (whether you have the restrictor kit fitted or not, as they are really unlikely to check the actual bike itself). Don't forget to tell your insurance though, some may charge you extra. 
The actual restrictor kit depends on your bike, some carb model bikes use washers in the carb inlet to reduce airflow (take 1-2 hours to fit) some have the ecu (can take 1-2 hours to fit depending on bike ecu type) and some have a throttle screw (5 mins to fit, but garages will still charge you an hours labour). I'm sure none of these will actually harm the bike longterm as they just reduce power, so are more likely to improve the life of the bike if anything. 
Hopefully my experience there has helped pal...but in no way is at all cheap. Going to get myself an sv when the right one comes along, but ive got to keep in mind the extra I've got to fork out before its legal on my license. I don't expect I'll keep the restrictor in for that long though as once the paperwork has been sent off it would be hard to find out that it had been changed back. 
What bike are you thinking of getting?

true,camsterc,null,null,"1) This doubling will take into account a champions league bonus that I'm sure all players have. It only makes sense to have champions league clauses and if you're writing a sensational article you might as well include it in your total.
2) 140k isn't that much. I know that sounds shocking but that's still half of what Rooney's on and 2 or 3 million less than other top strikers are on.
3) This is probably rounded up/including performance bonuses anyway.
4) any new contract with Sturridge will actually decrease his amortization cost. We paid 12 million for sturridge and signed a contract for probably 5 and a half years, the standard length for these things(January transfers). Thus we are paying  2.2 million a year in amortization expense. If we signed a new deal with him that could drop by 460 thousand or so(12-(2.2*1.5)=8.7, 8.7/5=1.74). There's 10k a month.

That being said:
5) it doesn't seem likely that we'd bother signing a new contract yet. This is probably a sensational article since there is little benefit to offer Sturridge a new contract this season. 460k a year isn't a huge drop in his amortization cost. It makes more sense to hold out another year and then see where we are. That way we pay him less wages next year, losing basically nothing from it since his contract is pretty long, and then the year after raise his wages, but have 15 or 20k in amortization cost decrease to offset it, and more revenue, and not have spent the extra million or 2 the year before.

Our problem year is the summer after this one. That's when a lot of our players start hitting the prime time for contract renewals, and our centrebacks get over the age hump. I'd expect the squad to remain relatively unchanged this summer. Specifically the starting 11 which will see only a change at fullback. The year after that we'll see kolo retire(or get another year if he does well next year) Agger and/or Skrtle go, a few new centrebacks, a gerrard replacement needed, a new fullback and probbably some midfield reinforcement if that isn't added this summer.

true,piouiy,null,null,"First off, thanks for putting in the effort to do the sums! Good to know the actual figures.

However, I don't really agree that the system is weighted towards the wealthy - or at least not in any way that is particularly unfair. People with money right now get all sorts of advantages - buying a house without a mortgage or a new car without a loan, not getting hit with overdraft fees, buying better quality things that won't need expensive repairs - etc etc etc. Basically, not having to take out a loan is nearly always cheaper, so I don't think the student loan system operating the same is particularly unfair.

By most accounts I still think we can say the scheme is *fairly* progressive. Many students won't start paying back the loan for several years. Only 70% of students were employed within 6 months of graduating (http://careers.theguardian.com/careers-blog/graduate-labour-market-figures). And if we are to believe the stories about graduates working in Starbucks, temp jobs, topshop etc, they are well under the threshold for paying anything back - but of course they are ticking away at that 30 years until the loan expires. Also, the actual graduate starting salary is more like Â£20k (http://careers.theguardian.com/reality-check-graduate-salary), not Â£26k. The Â£26k+ that get banded around is distorted by a few sectors such as finance, and also by London. If you look at starting salaries for common graduate professions such as teaching or science, they earn under Â£20k to start off. Even accounting or law outside of London probably has you starting on Â£19k, going up as you progress through your ACA or LPC. So again, that's delaying loan repayment for 2-3 years. Also factor in that most people will have some period of unemployment which will again knock some time off, though hopefully not too much!! 

I reckon if you adjusted for all of those thing, you'll see what the government also realised - most people won't pay back what they borrowed.

I also disagree with your use of ""penalises"". If somebody goes on to get a good job with a high enough salary to pay back the loan, then surely their university education was beneficial and was worth paying for? And they money is going into a system to help other people do the same. I don't think you can fairly call that being penalised if they directly benefited from the system and are asked to pay back into it once they are able. We've always ""penalised"" people who earn more with higher taxes and cutting their benefits but I don't think many of us would you say that income tax unfairly penalises higher earners. We say that it is a contribution based on the fact that you have been successful due to the help of others.

Don't get me wrong - I don't think the current system is particularly clever; mainly because such a huge proportion of graduates will simply never pay off the loan. So I can't really see this being cheaper from the governments point of view, thus making it pointless. But I also don't think it's biased towards the rich or hurts the poor.",0,1395549688,null,0,false,0,cg9kewg,t3_20z9cz,t1_cg9kewg,t1_cg9693s,null,1433027824,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

When the Doctor gave Rory the screwdriver, he already knew that he would escape the Pandorica as a result.  If the Doctor chose *not* to give Rory the screwdriver then the flappy dragons would have arrived because the present day Doctor changed his own past by not helping the past Doctor escape.

Agger has said that he's not here to sit on the bench. I think he'll go this summer. I think that was probably the intention when we bought Sakho last season. Give Sakho a bedding in season, and then sell Agger on. I think Lucas is more important than Agger. He'll be missed far more in terms of what he offers the team.

Regardless, the reason we got scored on twice in the first half was because Flanno was overrun at left back. It wasn't his fault, its just we play high press and Coutinho didn't help out on the left. Its as simple as that. You can't just say its a defender's fault when our system is designed to prioritize the attack.

At half-time, we shortened the pitch a bit more, reinforced our idea to dominate the ball and that led to our chances. We showed great resilience and again showed our offensive power. It was an outstanding result for us.

From Rodgers post game. Seriously, this was a tactical issue more than a defensive issue, we've just come off 2 clean sheets, this sub loves to freak out.

The centre of gravity may be moving towards (East) Asia, but it's still got a long way to go before we're a legitimate ethnic minority at home or in the world.  

It's also true that whites experience prejudice in other countries, but it's often an odd sort of prejudice.  I certainly never felt I could ""become"" Vetnamese in Vietnam, because of my skin colour, and mixed heritage children left behind after the American war there endured a roller coaster of attitudes towards them - often instrumentally, in terms of what they 'offered' their family in terms of perks or approbation.  My own children definitely experienced prejudice at school there (as well as some here).  But for myself, I've got to say that it was often a prejudice in the form of a cachet, I was assumed to be richer than I was, more well-informed and smarter than might have been justified, I could get in to places more easily (although some were semi or fully-barred and locals only), or get in to places whilst not appropriately attired, because it was assumed I was wealthy.

[5 Live](http://www.bbc.co.uk/5live/) itself is a mixture of talk radio and sports (sports tends to be during the day UK time). It can be good listening but as a national station it's unlikely to deal with the hyper-local issues you're after.

There are commercial (i.e. non-BBC) local radio stations as well in the UK but due to the necessity of making money they tend to be far more music-oriented, and most of them are actually owned by one of two or three large companies.

The only other station I can think of that might fit the bill is [LBC](http://www.lbc.co.uk/listen-live-3578). It's a London-based talk radio station so discussions will inevitably be skewed towards the capital's issues, but can be interesting regardless.

clearly because your career as a videographer/photographer makes you so informed and learned, you are practicality a scholar lol.

its not as if a complete moron who is incapable of understanding anything political and has no external accredited validation of his capabilities could just be a photographer/videographer lol.

Im sure its a real crucial requirement while photographing weddings that you understand the government infrastructure and its optimum configuration

while you are taking pictures of people at their wedding (lol) some of us earn our crust actually using our intellect and capabilities in a professional field that actually requires proven skills/intellect and a history of delivering complex and intricate ""solutions""

&gt;OMG I've been doxxed by a l33t hax0r! Please, you check back through a handful of posts and think you know me?

yeah clearly your education and profession have nothing to do with your knowledge or capabilities lol, I'm sure janitors know more than surgeons, they just prefer to work as janitors so dont apply their knowledge and skills in that field lol

&gt;While you're wasting all that time telling me I'm stupid (far from it) and uninformed about politics (oh, so very far from it)

yeah im sure you genuinely believe you are not stupid and that you are  well informed, thats what makes it so genuinely funny, 

just like the hairdresser that thinks ""she knows it all"" and those ""experts"" with their years of studies and accredited scientific education are morons for not believing in ""crystal healing"" which is obviously true and real.

and you still don't know  what an ad hominem fallacy is. ""do you even know how politics works?"" is not an ad hominem, the fact you still don't know this, or cant work it out (try getting someone with more patience to explain it to you) is a fucking embarrassment.

Its particularly delicious you still rigidly think you are correct and actually think you are intelligent. rarely does one encounter in the real world someone so very stupid they fail to see how stupid they are, but you keep telling yourself you are intelligent and how politically informed/experienced you are, I'm sure that will provide comfort as you're chasing after the bride and monitoring those light levels.

your comments are an absolute testament to your complete lack of ability and total ignorance, the cherry on top is you are so stupid that you cant see it yourself, so genuinely think you are capable/intelligent

Defacing a banknote may be illegal under Section 12 of the the Currency and Banknotes Act 1928 http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/18-19/13/section/12#commentary-c585931 but it's not treason and the penalty, as you'll see, is limited to a level 1 fine, which is currently Â£200, rather than death. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_scale#United_Kingdom

High Treason would be plotting the murder of the sovereign; committing adultery with the sovereign's consort, with the sovereign's eldest unmarried daughter, or with the wife of the heir to the throne; levying war against the sovereign and adhering to the sovereign's enemies, giving them aid or comfort; and attempting to undermine the lawfully established line of succession. 

Historically, coin clipping would have been classed as high treason, as expressly described by the Treason Act of 1415:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason_Act_1415

Though coin clipping is more about removing a piece of precious metal from the coin and then passing the coin off as having the same value, which was more about counterfeiting than doing anything to the sovereign's face.  Counterfeiting was high treason up until 1832 when the Coinage Offences Act downgraded all clipping and counterfeiting crimes from high treason to a fellony and removed the death penalty:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coinage_Offences_Act_1832

TLDR; defacing the queen's image is not treason, defacing money hasn't been treason or a capital offence since 1832, and treason itself hasn't been a capital crime since 1998.

true,a_royale_with_cheese,null,null,"Your argument is quite remarkable.  You think that failure to raise salaries matters most for consultants at the very top (Basic Salary Â£80988).

The point in the salary scale that is most affected is the lowest rung.  A FY1 Doctor earns Â£22636/year - after banding (assumed 40%), tax, NI, and pension (9%), that means they take home about Â£1750/month.  That's stayed mostly the same for the past few years - Â£1750 today is roughly equivalent to Â£1550 in 2008 (had it kept up with inflation, it would be Â£1977 today).  

The problem gets acutely worse if you have an unbanded job.  In FY2 that would net you Â£1614/month (again, if it kept up with inflation: Â£1823).  If you stick to an unbanded salary - that means you're effectively stuck with that for a year or two (I can't think of anything unbanded after that - there are rumours of some pathology subspecialties that go for 5 years unbanded, but I don't know where/what they are).

On top of that all these grades need to pay their GMC (north of Â£400/year), Exams (predominantly 1/year early on at about Â£350 per sitting* - not including travel costs [some exams are only done in London]), College registration fees (about Â£200, I think).  Courses and study materials will feature on everyone's budget to the tune of a few hundred/year, but will vary and are ""not obligatory"".

Now, not all people at this level are under 26, I've met FY1s in their mid30s and 40s.

Are you quite sure that failure to meet inflation will mostly affect those earning over Â£80,000/year?

I was wondering though when exactly you would play the ""I have a better life"" card to try and provide some kind of comfort to yourself.

Having been routinely exposed for the moron you are on the actual issue and in terms of credibility i expected you to play it around here.

Are you going to parade your kids next and try and convince yourself you have value and are a ""winner"" 

perhaps you are going to accuse me of being a virgin next? or maybe typing while wearing a fedora perhaps? you do whatever you feel you need to do to try and make yourself feel better princess, don't worry about me i have this thing called ""reality"" that means i can endure whatever nonsense you try and make yourself feel better with.

So bitter alone virgin wearing a fedora, would it help if you thought i was fat and spotty too? perhaps i should be a teenager also, oh wait you have already tried that angle. how about  balding with a pony tail or whatever visually comforts you and helps you ignore the reality of your own inadequacy.

That makes no sense. The copper/fibre mix has nothing to do with congestion - if congestion is going to occur, it will occur anywhere from the backhaul links from those cabinets, to somewhere in the exchange, or somewhere in the ISP network. The connections from houses to the cabinet are dedicated (except for Virgin). The main reason for throttling is to reduce congestion far away from the local network (except for Virgin) - because more demand means having to buy expensive capacity from BT.

Also, BT does have full fibre to the premises in some areas.

&gt;  The ISP's that use pure fibre in cables under the street (BSkyB, Virgin) have no excuse for throttling as their entire connection is fibre but they do so anyway. 

Sky fibre is technically no different to BT itself or any other ISP that uses the BT network - it's FTTC from Openreach controlled equipment (as far as I know, Sky currently doesn't offer FTTP via BT where it is available). Virgin isn't fibre to the premises by any stretch, it is fibre to a node and copper coax to the house. Virgin is also the network most likely to suffer from local congestion.

I would never seek to sell Daniel Agger. He's one of our most experienced defenders, has proven quality and has been a very loyal servant. For those reasons he deserves another season to prove his worth. Remember Skrtel from last year? He was also at fault on many occasions and this season he is doing very well, has been our most consistent defender throught the season. I'm not saying it is a guarantee that Agger will have a much improved season next year, however I firmly believe he deserves the chance to produce it in a Liverpool shirt.

Skrtel, for a big chunk of last season, was a back-up defender. He still to apply himself, to work hard, do his best to improve and this season, he got his chance, took it and he has proven to everyone that he's a quality defender.

I think the climate of the first two Blair governments, where their majority was such that there was no effective opposition, had a depressing effect on the quality of scrutiny that Parliament was able to bring to bear on the government's legislation (and Blair sent them a LOT of new laws, particularly in criminal justice).

That said, I think New Labour had a tendency towards the catch-all when it came to criminal justice anyway.  Their attitude to policing seemed to be to view people as potential criminals rather than citizens, an attitude which has sadly outlasted them.

As an example though, it should be noted though that one of my personal pet peeves, s.127 of the Communications Act 2003 - which is the police's current go-to catch-all when they want to arrest someone for something silly they said on the internet - wasn't actually used for that purpose while the government that wrote it was in office.  As is often the case with legislation, something framed sloppily by one government can be found 'useful' by the authorities much later on.

Hanlon's razor would assume that this happens more often than clauses being left intentionally vague because it's useful to the government - though I would accept that some cases, such as certain sections of anti-terrorism legislation, do seem to fall into that latter category.",0,1395570918,null,0,false,0,cg9ok54,t3_212hia,t1_cg9ok54,t1_cg9o7ki,null,1433029930,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Or you're booking one for almost a week's time. By then, with many problems, you're either recovered or more ill. 

Many services seem already to have been privatised. I am five week's in to giving up smoking, but I was referred to a 'specialist' at boots for nicotine patches. The service there is fine, but this used to be done at the local surgery, and represents money going to boots shareholders rather than the NHS. 

I've been stable on substance misuse treatment, which, again is contracted out to another service. And, incidentally, they are losing funding, too - I have to come off my medication within the year. *I* am confident that I'll be able to stay clean without it now, but in the next twelve months, there will be many people who have been stable on maintenance treatment who are kicked off, and relapse into addiction.

there are two real issues to your stupidity in your reply

1) you think because you cant recognise something that's my failing (on the contrary), I fully expect and have stated as such you think your a genius and intelligent and think i am not, like the farmer thinking he knows better than the physicist on black holes.

2)you are so stupid you point out my history seems to be geared towards identifying and challenging idiots on Reddit and then later try and claim you are getting the better of me for ""I'm deliberately provoking your endless streams of rage for my own personal amusement"" if you actually weren't such a moron and could actually research properly you you could tell i frequent rage so rather than playing into your hands you are doing exactly as I want. and allowing me to expose your real world stupidity in a frame of my choosing (i choose rage), rage is a luxury i don't get to enjoy at work (its called  professionalism)

Your career and life is real, and you know you are a photographer/videographer, a job any idiot can become simply by buying the equipment, its not a prestigious career and being a wedding photographer etc, is a ""low skilled"" job and not considered an esteemed  profession.

Example; a friend of mine is a Sikh and although born in the country his family are immigrants, when i got into photography as a hobby he told me of his uncle or uncles friend (i forget which) who came to this country with no qualifications and no skills whatsoever, what business did he start? yes you have guessed it wedding photography and videography and that is how me makes a living.

you see what you don't realise because you are very stupid is all your attempts to undermine me are completely non effective because i know exactly what i do for a living i know my qualifications and i know my career history , you can claim as much as you like that you dont believe them or ""Its not true"" it doesn't matter reality confirms my claims, if you cant or wont accept them that has no impact on me.

however all my comments regarding your position are also based in reality your job is as stated and your education is as stated, you can deny being an idiot but everything i have said about your career and background and details you yourself have stated are true.

Its like if I hypothetically genuinely was tall and you were hypothetically genuinely very fat, if i claim to be tall and you don't believe me it doesn't make me short and all your attacks of accusing me of being short etc have no impact on me whatsoever as I am tall, and i know it (reality is fixed) likewise if i attack you for being ""fat"" and you are fat you can pretend it doesn't bother you or that you are ""playing a game""  but reality is such that you are fat, and you know it.

You are a low skilled worker with a unrelated and common education that's your reality. i am a Professional whose educational history has been congruent with his position now, I work in an environment with selection criteria with others of the same professional and educational background, who in relative terms (entire population) represent the highly skilled and intellectual (doctors, lawyers etc).

so you go ahead and try and pretend that you are intelligent and have value, and try and ignore the present reality of your situation. and keep up the hostility in the hope i am lying and my claims are all bluffs and that i am crying as i type this.

One thing I like about it is that it contains an opiate blocker, and it's nice to know that if I did relapse, it wouldn't work. Another thing is that it doesn't *feel* like an opiate. There's none of the cotton wool feeling -physically or psychologically - that you get with methodone or brown. It feels like nothing at all, like being clean. Which, after all, is what I'm aiming for. I've always felt that Subutex is for people who want to get clean, and methodone is for people who don't. 

Both treatments, though, are being curtailed. Govt policy is that there will be no more maintenance treatment. Admittedly, some people get stick in a rut with it, but for others (like myself) it enables them to be drug-free, have a life and a job. As I said, I think I can cope with the change, but many won't. 
It's typical sort-term thinking. I predict a spike in the number of addicts as people relapse, a rise in the associated street crime, a rise in custodial sentences. Costing much more in terms of both government spending and human misery.

true,a_royale_with_cheese,null,null,"The argument I'm making is particularly for people moving into unbanded jobs.

I don't know of any unbanded FY1 posts.  So moving to an unbanded F2 post, or ST1 post means you actually get a pay cut (FY1 + 40% banding &gt; FY2 basic salary).  After the big jump in basic salary from F1 to F2 (Â£5500), increments are at about Â£1500 (about 5%) - not too bad.

The problem is that every year, we are ""poorer"" of than our predecessors doing the same thing.  That applies across the board.  So if I'm a ST4 in Gastro (I'm not), I'm worse off^* than last year's ST4 in Gastro.  Now ST4's in Gastro are banded and get paid OK - so you don't really notice it.  I'm told some registrar rotas in Glasgow are still at band 2A (+80%).

Since doctor's salary increases have been below inflation for over 5 years, then the above effect adds up.  So an F1 today is effectively Â£150pm ""worse off""^* than 5 years ago.  Our hypothetical ST4 in Gastro is effectively about Â£300pm ""worse off""^* than his equivalent 5 years ago.  When you become a consultant, your salary will not get you as far as it used to.  Basically, you're getting a stealth pay cut, the effects of which are significant because it's over so long.  You're looking at your pay cheque from year to year and not looking at the broader picture.

So my argument is two-fold:

1. Your salary is ""worse""^* than for people before you at your grade, with your level of seniority.

2. The effect is felt most by those who earn least (unbanded FY2s).  They'll see a pay rise, but will still be worse off than other doctors at their grade before them.

Just because your salary is OK, doesn't mean that things on a broader scale are OK.

I don't think it's realistic to achieve 4th in general

Both of which are pretty impossible though, as my point illustrates. 

&gt; I think Swansea are a really good team

They are third from bottom in the form table, and have 1 win in 9 since the managerial takeover.  

&gt; and they were playing great today

We played awful, we allowed them to play at us- which was the reason that we struggled. Other than Bony they really weren't very good, our midfield was just non-existent. 

&gt;They were totally out of it, giving the ball away constantly, making easy mistakes

It was one game, yes they didn't turn up- but that happens. They are not a bunch of kids who will get knocked for 6 from that, they will bounce back. Wenger is too good to let it really affect them.

&gt; I said that 1) we can beat newcastle, 2) we can beat fulham, 3) we can tie arsenal, and 4) arsenal may lose to swansea and probably will to man city.

And I illustrated how this is pretty much as unlikely as finishing 4th. You are taking for granted a whole hell of a lot of circumstances that are actually pretty unlikely- Arsenal losing to Swansea at home... yea, right. That is the definition of far fetched that is. Getting a win against The Toon is tough also, you are hugely underestimating them, they are very tight at the back and have the players to score when given a chance, plus we are totally shit away from home recently.

&gt; and then you totally disregarded that same logic when discussing swansea vs arsenal.


Arsenal are while hell of a lot better than us.

Agger is a tough one because he's a fantastic CB and he suits the style of play in a lot of ways but he is far from complete and he needs a suitable partner to excel. The biggest thing with Agger is that even if he stays is it the best thing for the club?

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"&gt;What I don't understand is why a so called 'independent' Scotland would want to still be hanging onto the coattails of the UK post independence.

Well, it's simple really. Independence for independence's sake is just stupid. Yes wants to leave the Union because it's not working very well, and shows no signs of working in the future. However, remaining in dialogue and friendship with the rUK *would* benefit Scotland, and so it is supported.

This is also why you see near universal support amongst the Scottish parties for devolution, but not full independence. People aren't happy with the status quo, but they feel independence is a step too far.

&gt;Maybe the SNP isn't as confident about the economic future of an independent Scotland as they say they are.

On this point, I feel personally that it's telling that no one has claimed specifically that such a Union would be perminant. I feel (and this just me talking) that the currency union is planned to be a temperory solution to counteract any market uncertainty in Scotland immediately after independence, which would later settle down as iScotland gets the engine going, as it were. But then I feel it would be better to create a separate Scottish currency and then peg this to Sterling, and then unpeg it some time afterwards, to counteract market uncertainty in iScotland's infancy. That's certainly the established method for other countries in that situation.

&gt;Be independent or not, but don't expect the rest of the UK to underwrite your economy if you choose independence, because that, surely, would not be true independence.

Well that's the thing, they're not *expecting* per se, this is their negotiating position. They just feel that a currency union would be so beneficial for all involved that only a fool would reject it out of hand.

Boo-fucking-hoo for you! Then it was extremely irresponsible to undertake a degree that you couldn't afford to complete.

&gt;Additionally, in response to your ""other far cheaper and possibly better options"", I say, ""no."" No, there were not better and cheaper options for me. I'm from America, where university is more than twice the cost for even a decent education.

Actually that's incorrect and I'm sure you know that but are hoping I don't. If you were fortunate enough to come out of high school with good enough grades like my American fiancÃ©e (and I accept no matter how smart you are you need to be lucky too, she couldn't have come out valedictorian without a reasonably stable home) then pick a a good, public, in state uni (she went to Temple - back when it was still state - despite getting in to UPen, McGill Boston Collage, Ithica) then you can get a full ride like she did.

Even assuming if what ever reason you don't qualify for a full ride or any kind of assistance, full fees for Temple (bearing in mind it's private now) are $14,000. In state for Kansas is $8,000. In state in NY is $6,000, in state TX $9,150. Unless your state is radically different then you did have radically cheaper options.

lets play the game of showing those at home just how retarded you actually are by using your own words.

&gt;A recent psychology study showed a **worrying correlation in traits such as sadism and psychopathy with online trolling**; it's entirely possible that these people are enjoying the effect they are having, **disturbing though that thought is**.

and
&gt;You don't even have the self awareness or intelligence to realise that **I'm deliberately provoking your endless streams of rage for my own personal amusement**

&gt;I'm loving watching you waste your life. Not that you were doing anything else with it anyway


lets pick another to see how successful you are?

&gt;Rising fuel bills, having to subsidise my second bedroom so that I can still have my kids for three days a week, you can easily end up in a situation where you only have Â£5-10 a week to spend on food. I got through a lot of Tesco Value 11p noodles at that point.

this speaks for itself as a testament to your capability both career wise, and your capability as a father.

i just cant understand  why you don't live with your kids permanently and with your wife too? lol.

so using only your own words and admissions, you are sadistic psychopath who couldn't support his own kids and makes bad life decisions and has a broken family who he couldn't support

and im the loser? lol

I warned you, reality is my friend and your enemy.

lets she what mental gymnastics you try and comfort yourself now that your own words confirm your own failure as a professional and as a father. and you dare to think you have value or insight over me in a field you know nothing about.

You should seriously re-evaluate your life, you are a failure in about every metric one can think of.

Carvajal is homegrown and has potential, the smart long term decision for Madrid would be to go for someone similar to Carvajal who can compete and develop alongside him, effectively hedging their bets in case one of the two doesn't pan out. Someone like Fernandes or De Sciglio (both of course are going to be expensive). If they want a short term improvement at the position, they can go after one of the Chelsea right backs, Lichsteiner, or other similar guys. 

If they do decide to veer away from their normal policy and just want someone above average, experienced, and relatively cheap for Madrid standards, there's still Sagna who is out of contract in the summer.

Rammy often gets himself into very forward positions, so someone needs to help Matic protect the backline. Schurrle, with his desire to always get behind the last defender, should not be relied upon to interchange with Rammy.

When Luiz is on the pitch (in CDM with Matic), there's less of a need for someone as defensive as Willian. Schurrle should be on to make those runs and play attacking football.

You say you can prove that trying to possess the ball won't work with a 4-4-2 because it didn't work this year with a 4-3-3.  How does that prove anything other than my point that we should try something else?  If we don't find a way to possess the ball more we are going to be predictably tired at the end of every game.  The Chelsea game would have been very different if they didn't go a man down.  We played very well but to continue to play that way makes for a very nerve racking last 20 minutes where all of our men are dead tired.

You clearly have little understanding of defense.  I live and breath defense.  That's what I play, that's what I coach.  Throwing three not-so-defensive midfielders in the middle of the pitch to try to clog it up isn't real defense.  That isn't how football is meant to be played.  Defense in football is a thing of fluidity.  So when Fabian decides to take the ball up the pitch (which he has every right two do) I don't expect Westwood to hold down the pitch by himself.  I expect someone to fill in to Delph's position just like good football players are taught to do since thy are children.  

Saying that a 4-4-2 wouldn't be able to unlock a stubborn defense is ""naive at best and downright ignorant at worst"".  That is the point of a 4-4-2 vs a 4-3-3.  A 4-3-3 is suited for a counterattacking play where as a 4-4-2 would allow us to spread out the play more, which would force their defense to spread out and force mistakes.  Using tactics rather than obsessing instead of looking at breaking down defenses as finding a player who is going to dribble through the whole defense.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not hating on the 4-3-3.  I love it.  It suits are team at present time and will continue to suit it.   The way Lambert has played it has made it much more flexible than I would have thought possible.  However I think that having options is always a good thing.  I think Lambert would strongly agree.  He is well known for constantly changing his tactics.  Why do you think he bought Tonev?  He wasn't planning on replacing Gabby within the 4-3-3.  If Tonev fulfilled his potential he would be the Albrighton-like player on the left that would allow us to play a 4-4-2.

My last point has nothing to do with football.  Our team is doing well, mate.  You must either be having a really bad day or be a very cynical person to be  shooting out insults to a fellow Villan just for disagreeing slightly about tactics.

Q4: Pellegrini has changed the way we played. Mancini was all about building from the back and attacking from the middle whereas Pellegrini focuses more on the wings. I frankly think but am not hoping that we will screw up somehow and hand the league to Chelsea. 

Q5: Kompany hands down. He inspires the team more than anyone else. 

Q8: More favorable draws. 

Q9: I think we will look to bring in players from the youth academy, as much as we've done pre-Mansour. Most of our players are in their prime and the development and promotion of players in the academy should coincide with the first team players exiting their prime years. 

Q10: Apart from the obvious, I've always kept my eye out for Fofana but I'm unsure of his technical development. Bytyqi is another who looks an interesting prospect. 

Q11: Best signing for me is Fernandinho, worst probably has to be Jamie Oliver. 

Q12: I think these two clubs will act as bases to source and acquire players from their respective regions. 

Q13: Involve more players from the youth teams.

Q14: Hart, Zaba, Kompany, Nastasic, Clichy, Silva, Fernandinho, Toure, Nasri, Aguero, Negredo. Sadly, Nastasic and Aguero are not at full fitness and may miss the match.

5. Kompany, without a doubt. 

6. If he can stay fit then definitely yes, even if it's rotating with Nasri and Silva.

7. Nasty has been very unfortunate but will come back strong next year. 

8. Maybe an easier group. Honestly just more of the same, our time will come eventually.

10. Lopes. Keep your eyes peeled for him. 

11. Best, Fernandinho. Worst, Jovetic, only because of injuries though.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"The most important thing in football is moving forward, and nothing says moving forward like beating a points record, and doing it in style. 

Martinez has brought in a system that is pretty different to what Moyes used, and pretty much the whole team (aside from a few exceptions) have learned to shine under it. Some players however took longer than others, and our early results this season reflect that. 

For me the biggest improvements are Naismith and Osman- both players who looked shocking at the start of the campaign, but have both developed into really effective players when used correctly. In addition to that, I feel it took Baines several months to really become effective in his new duty- but now he is consistently performing at the level we have come to expect of him. 

There is no doubt it my mind that if we replayed those early games where we dropped silly points (Norwich, Cardiff and WBA) we would come away with closer to 7 points as opposed to three. There were certain things missing in our style then that have been worked on since... And it shows. 

Of course bringing Lukaku in was a big coup, he has provided a get out of jail card a number of times- but he is far less intrinsic to the way we play than some observers would have the masses think. Yes, he is a great player- but he is far from irreplaceable, and if we do some good business in the summer it is not unrealistic that we could get someone who is *significantly* better than him in the system we play. 


---

Because of this, beating our current target would be a huge achievement- we have had to learn on the job so often this season, but next year we will be able to get off to a running start. In addition to that, the players we have learning on the job have shown so much improvement in doing so that a summer of hard work could push them to be genuine world class players next year. 

Barkley has been off and on, but a baptism of fire in Brazil and a solid pre-season with the gaffer may well be all he needs to be *on* all of the time. Stones also, he has made mistakes; yes.. but he is 19, playing centreback in one of the toughest leagues in the world for a defender, and in the past few games he has had little to no protection from the midfield. Even top defenders make mistakes when left exposed for 90 minutes, and as long as he is learning from them I can see him becoming a real England squad member within a few years.

We need to keep the ball rolling, keep improving and keep developing talent through the ranks. The issue with Moyes is that we stagnated as a club, we all got a bit comfortable, and that target of beating last years points target was somewhat forgotten. I feel that under Martinez we have got a drive to achieve greater things, and as long as we are not stagnating, the top 4 will come eventually... But having that as a primary focus is going to cause issues long term. 

I would have bitten your hand, arm, and most of your torso off if you offered me the possibility of 65 points pre season, and whilst goals certainly change over the year- whatever was an initial goal is still relevant.

2) Apparently not [in the rest of the UK](http://yougov.co.uk/news/2014/02/16/opposition-currency-union-rises-sharply-england-an/). Even if there were doubts about the positive/negative aspects of a currency union, the fact that all 3 parties have come out against it would make them stick to that line of thinking. How would they gain any favour with the rest of the UK by going back on their stance? 

3) It could mean that but it could also mean that a currency union is such a bad idea that all 3 parties agree that it should not take place. Similar to #1, the UK Treasury has advised it is a bad economic move. Where would the positive economic benefit analysis come from and why would they choose it over the UK treasury's analysis?

4) If you're alluding to Lib Dems I don't think the situations are similar. In one instance there is a case of shared power, in the other there is the case for split powers. 

I genuinely think its good that Scotland is having a referendum and if the Scottish people want independence I think they should have it. But at the point of independence, I don't think it is in the new UK's best interests to enter into a currency union. Thank you for linking me to the White Paper btw.

The article quotes S1(1) of the terrorism act but wilfully ignores S1(1)(a) which says that in order for an act to be an act of terror, the action *must* fall under S1(2).

Broadly, that means that an act (or threat of an act) is an act of terror if it:

* involves serious violence against a person,
* involves serious damage to property,
* endangers a personâs life, other than that of the person committing the action,
* creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public, or
* is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system.

**AND**

the use or threat is designed to influence the government
or to intimidate the public or a section of the public, 

**AND**


the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause.


It's not the finest piece of legislation but it's specific enough (noting that even the first section needs to then be read in the context of the rest of the act), but the author wilfully misinterprets the text to make a point. If she had bothered to take even the merest hint of legal advice, she might have had to have found a different hook to hang her hat from.

She then goes on to conflate further points - Assange's extradition (for which he was given the finest legal advocacy and was given a full, open and transparent hearing all the way to the highest court in the land), the destruction of the Guardian data (which was with the consent of the Guardian, and see the posts further up the topic regarding the handling of classified information being less easy than people might think) which are all worthy subjects of discussion in their own right, but aren't even slightly relevant to her own 'plight'.

true,devineman,logo,,"&gt;**Q1: What have you made of how Moyes has done for United this season?**

I think he's done as well as could be expected.  Replacing a man who has been in charge of a Club like United for several decades is an insurmountable task.  Every single player at United knows the ""Ferguson way"" of doing things and most have had it drilled into them.  It will take time for Moyes to get his feet under the table and the players to trust him instead of falling back on their old ""Ferguson ways"".  A bit like putting together a jigsaw there are several methods. of doing it.  If the boss asks you to start on the corners and the old boss asks you to start with a noticable bit, it's not going to work properly.  Everybody has to be on the same wavelength and Ferguson was such a force of nature that it will take time (and money to bring in new guys) to replace him in the players minds.

&gt;**Q2: Where do you think United will finish in the league come the end of the season, and how do you think weâll do in what is left of the Champions League?**

I think this season is one that you mark off as a transitional period but it goes to show how high expectations are that they'll probably finish 5th and get the Europa League place still.  Everton will have their traditional collapse and Spurs goal difference compared to United's is worth another point in United's favour.  To be honest it might not be such a bad thing.  I don't think United have ever won the Europa League and lots of fans I knew when you were knocked out of the CL groups were hoping you could complete the collection.
I fancy you to do well at Old Trafford against Bayern as the crowd is generally good for this type of game but overall to lose the tie.

&gt;**Q3: We have played against each other many times over the years. What is your favourite derby memory?**

Well, the 6-1 wasn't bad!  I enjoyed the Munich anniversary derby as a spectacle especially as I went there expecting us to get absolutely twatted.  The 5-1 is probably my favourite in 1989 as it felt like City were on the verge of something then as many of that team were Youth Cup winners a couple of years earlier and the future felt bright.  Obviously the ""5 past Tracey"" was by far the worst.  In fact that was the worst result in my life I think.

&gt;**Q4: How well do you think Pellegrini has done for you this season, and do you think you will win the league this season? Although you have a few games in hand, you also have three tough away fixtures coming up in the next four games. If you donât win the league, which club would you like to see win it?**

I'm not really one of those who has a second choice Club to win it.  If we don't win it I couldn't give a toss who does.  Apart from you guys obviously but that's mainly because I know a bunch of United fans and next to no Chelsea fans in my day to day life.
I think Pelle is getting there as a manager.  He has made some strange decisions in his rotation policy and he has this habit of taking off our major threats in those games against smaller teams that he think he's beaten which has given them momentum and cost us points.  He plays good football though and certain players such as Nasri and Yaya have come on leaps and bounds under him.  I'm confident that we'll win the league.  Well, that sort of confidence where it's more out of hope than expectation.  One of those ""ask me next month"" questions.

&gt;**Q5: Yaya Toure or Vincent Kompany. Who is the most important player to the team, as you have pushed over the edge into a top team regularly competing for the League?**

Good question without an easy answer.  Straight away my head said Kompany.  Kompany is the leader of Manchester City in the same way that Keane or Robson were for Manchester United.  On the tunnel cams that we put out you can constantly see him geeing up the boys in the tunnel and he is constantly communicating when he's on the pitch and the ball is up front.  He leads by example many, many times.  The only thing that stops me from giving that as a definitive answer is that our Chairman gave an interview not long ago who stated that he thought Yaya was one of our most important players sicne the takeover.  The reasoning being that whilst Robinho came in and wanked us off, Yaya believed in the project and was constantly working to help the Club.  He's obviously also another of our big game players who scored the FA Cup winning goal and the goal against Newcastle in the title winning run up.   I'll go for Kompany by a bulbous head.

&gt;**Q6: Do you think Jovetic can become a permanent fixture in the starting lineup or will he be behind Aguero, Negredo &amp; Dzeko in the pecking order?**

The idea seems to be have Negredo and Dzeko rotate for one spot and Aguero and Jovetic rotate for the other spot.  Jovetic's problem isn't down to not being picked but that his legs are made of Rice Krispies.  He has been injured about 5 times since he got here and he hasn't even been here a season yet!

&gt;**Q7: Nastasic had a great first season for your club, but this season has been blighted by injuries. What have you made of how he has done this season when fit, and why do you think heâs had so many injuries this season?**

Nastasic had a great first season after making his debut against Real Madrid.  I think he's one of the ones who hasn't really improved under Pellegrini and needed a Mancini type to drive him.  You get the feeling that Pellegrini indulges people's insecurities at times and people are starting to wonder whether Nastastic's and Jovetic's injuries are in some part mental rather than physical.  He was a good player for us though and City fans have big hopes for him when he does get fit.

&gt;**Q8: What do you think you need to make a bigger impact on the Champions League?**

Just time really.  All of our Champions League groups have been extremely hard due to our low coefficient putting us in Pot 3.  The one time we get a semi-decent group, we get Barca in the first knockout stage.  It will come in time.

&gt;**Q9: What do City fans think about the investment in the academy? Will that become a long-term benefit or will City continue to buy top class talent to the point youth can't break in (like Chelsea)?**

I think it's great.  It's revitalised the dilapidated area around the stadium and it providing jobs to local residents.  Can't really argue with that.  
City are very much attempting the Barcelona model which is why we've hired some of their administrators in Soriano and Begiristan.  Even in the first communication with City, Sheikh Mansour stressed that he wants to build a strong Academy to put players into the first team and the financial realities of it mean that it's an area where I think we'll do well in.
This season we've already had Lopes get some minutes, Huws has made his debut and is doing well on loan at Birmingham (with one of your lads there) and we've got Rekik coming back from PSV to potentially take Lescott's place.  I think it's too early to ask and in a couiple of seasons we'll see how much of our commitment to youth development is all talk.  It's worth noting that our U18s are top of the league, our U16s are, out U14s and U13s both won their national championship so we hagve the talent coming through.

&gt;**Q10: Are there any youth prospects you have that youâre excited about/looking forward to perhaps see breakthrough in the future?**

I think Lopes, Rekik and maybe Huws are the big ones at the minute.  In the longer term future we have Thierry Ambrose, Jack Byrne, Jason Denayer and maybe Devante Cole in our U21s and U18 teams who look promising.  Quite a few in our U16s put these are too far away to really know which well they will end up.

&gt;**Q11: Who do you feel has been your best and worst signing this season?**

Fernandinho has been the best signing this season by a long way.  He has completely changed the way that we play football and the amount to which Yaya can press forward.  Worst is a tough one but I'm going with Jovetic simply because we paid a ton of money for a guy made out of marshmallows. 

&gt;**Q12: As well as the academy, your owners have invested lots of money in the City, plan to expand the stadium, and have established a womenâs team along with establishing New York City FC and investing in Melbourne Heart FC. What have you made of it all, and in particular, how do you think the investment in Melbourne Heart FC along with the creation of New York City FC will impact on you as a club?**

I like it, as the Barca boys (the executives at City) would say it is a ""holistic approach"" to development.  I'm extremely pleased in particularly with our purchase of City Women and the professionalism which we are bringing into the Women's game.  I have high hopes that we can really make an impact for the good of the English grassroots game in general in this area.  As far as NYCFC and MHFC go I see no issues with it.  The idea here is to share resources between all of the Clubs which opens doors in two major commercial markets like Melbourne and New York for City to bring in deals from, and we could help each other by loaning our youngsters to teams that share our vision of how to play football.  Loaning players to the Championship where a team could play kick and rush is less favourable than loaning to a team in the MLS or A-League who use our training methods and our philosophy on how to play the game.  By their view, NYCFC and MHFC get extreme investment and get to share our entire scouting databases, our performance analysis ideas and share coaches including coach education.  It's win-win all round as far as I can see.

&gt;**Q13: What are your goals for the club next season?**

I think we should realistically be looking at challenging for the league and again reaching the knockout stages of the Champions League.  I'm not one of those who demands X amounts of trophies every year otherwise it's a failure, it's more important to me to be consistently challenging for every trophy available",0,1395582086,null,0,false,0,cg9qerz,t3_21578t,t1_cg9qerz,t3_21578t,null,1433030803,14,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,14

I feel i have gotten as much as i needed from this conversation, as your self delusion is growing tiresome, i feel i have really enjoyed  journeying through the freakshow that is you but you are just repeating your own pathetic self delusion in substitute of any actual new content .

you are an embarrassment to yourself and you know it, genuinely makes me laugh when i think of you making a living photographing happy couples getting married when you failed to keep your family and partner together and are reminded of this with every click of the shutter like some washed up bitter divorcee lol.

I'll think of you scraping a crust together wallowing in your own tears next time I am on the train journeying to work for an important meeting, and remind myself that no matter how stressful it seems things could always be worse, i could be a washed up 40 year old degenerate with a broken family and no real career who continually deludes himself for sake of his puny fragile ego that he is intelligent when he is actually well below average and he knows it.


As stated many times, reality is a friend of mine and an enemy of yours, when all is said and done you are the one who is left with your life, and i will be left with mine, it's my reward and your punishment
Just try not to let your tears damage your equipment as salt water is terrible for electronics.


you can consider this conversation closed, but if an opening occurs where i need a delusional moron who cant support or keep a family together ill be in touch, as you sound like you could use decent money...... i wouldn't hold your breathe though,...... actually if i was you, i would hold my breathe for a very very long time.

I, know anyone else, is proposing that.

Everyone 18 and older should be able to vote on what happens in their country, as in Switzerland and other proper democracies.

""The public IS stupid and is not educated on the EU well enough to make an intelligent and informed decision on it.""

Got a source for that? Or is it just another stupid assumption europhiles like to make? You assume you are the only ones good enough to have any say on the EU, and you would sacrifice due process and democracy to make sure YOU get YOUR way.

If the public voted to leave the EU, that is their choice. It is then the job of the Government to make sure the benefits of such a choice are maximized and the negatives (if there are any) are minimized.

""Sure compare me to hitler, this is where you've lost the argument if you have no other points than that.""

I have plenty of points, but the comparison between you (and other Europhiles) with the Socialist and communist governments around the world, as well as the fascist parties that have been in power in recent history is plain to see and , frankly, startling.

http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Will4/1-2/22/enacted

&gt;...if any such Proprietor or Driver, or any Waterman or other Person, shall feed the Horses of or belonging to any Hackney Carriage in any Street, Road, or common Passage, save only with Corn out of a Bag, or with Hay which he shall hold or deliver with his Hands... every such Proprietor, Driver, Waterman, or other Person so offending shall forfeit Twenty Shillings.

As you can see, the law only applies to cab drivers feeding their horses, and even then, they didn't need to keep the bag with them in the cab, just make sure when they did feed their horse, they didn't put the food directly in the streets, but instead fed him out of a bag or out of their hands. 

Also the law was repealed by The Statue Law (Repeals) Act of 1976: http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1976/16

So 

a) the law was repealed 

b) given that modern black cab drivers wouldn't feed their horses, this law wouldn't have applied to them anyway

c) even if it did, they wouldn't need to bring a bag of hay with them, so long as any hay they did feed the horse was fed from from their hand.

d) it was corn that had to fed from a bag, not hay

e) it's a bag, not a bale

It used to be that companies and organisations employed a handyman directly; the met would have never expected a copper to start changing bulbs (unless it was so blindingly simple and easy that it'd be daft not to) as they pay them to copper, not muck about with ladders, tools and lightbulbs.

People always use the lightbulb example because people know how to change a lightbulb at home. It's a quick and easy job, assuming that you don't use fluorescents in some sort of industrial/commercial fitting that may or may not be maintained (and thus live all the time), amongst other considerations.

There *is* an argument as to whether or not the met is getting value for money, but that needs to be compared to the costs of either a) directly employing staff who can do janitorial work or b) absorbing the cost of coppers doing the work and thus not doing anything else (notwithstanding the army of civilian staff that has always existed to support the policing side).",0,1395585233,null,0,false,0,cg9r8ax,t3_21578m,t1_cg9r8ax,t1_cg9q6us,null,1433031189,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

true,zzonked7,logo,,"Q1: What have you made of how Moyes has done for United this season?

**It's been better than I could have ever hoped. Of course Ferguson leaving was going to cause a drop, but I don't think anyone predicted this level of performance from last years champions.**

Q2: Where do you think United will finish in the league come the end of the season, and how do you think weâll do in what is left of the Champions League?

**6 or 7th. Can't see United getting past Bayern. They are probably the best team in the world at the moment.**

Q3: We have played against each other many times over the years. What is your favourite derby memory?

**6-1. Not much else needs to be said.**

Q4: How well do you think Pellegrini has done for you this season, and do you think you will win the league this season? Although you have a few games in hand, you also have three tough away fixtures coming up in the next four games. If you donât win the league, which club would you like to see win it?

**I think City have a good chance at the league, but it's still up for grabs. I reckon it's about 40% chance each for Chelsea and City, maybe 20% for Liverpool depending on how they perform in the big games they have left at home.**

Q5: Yaya Toure or Vincent Kompany. Who is the most important player to the team, as you have pushed over the edge into a top team regularly competing for the League?

**I would say Kompany.**

Q6: Do you think Jovetic can become a permanent fixture in the starting lineup or will he be behind Aguero, Negredo &amp; Dzeko in the pecking order?

**I have a feeling he will never get over his injury problems at City. Maybe he has the ability to become a starter, but I get the impression that we might never find out.**

Q7: Nastasic had a great first season for your club, but this season has been blighted by injuries. What have you made of how he has done this season when fit, and why do you think heâs had so many injuries this season?

**He should be in the starting team when fit. I don't agree that his injury problems are anything more than physical though. Saying he has mental issues is pure speculation from people who have no idea what his mental state is like.**

Q8: What do you think you need to make a bigger impact on the Champions League?

**Honestly I think just qualifying every year is a big step. If a team consistently qualifies and has a pretty good team, eventually they'll win the whole thing. There is a big element of luck and it's rare that the best team actually wins the whole competition. Look at when Chelsea won it, they finished 6th in the league.**

Q9: What do City fans think about the investment in the academy? Will that become a long-term benefit or will City continue to buy top class talent to the point youth can't break in (like Chelsea)?

**I don't agree that buying talent prevents youth players from reaching their potential. If they were good enough, they would play. Bringing in quality players actually gives them people to learn from and increases the competitive element. If youth players got an easy ride into the first team, there would be less incentive to improve. I think it's really shallow thinking when people say the England team suffers because of foreign imports. There are fundamental reasons why English players have fallen behind and it has nothing to do with foreign players being better.**

Q10: Are there any youth prospects you have that youâre excited about/looking forward to perhaps see breakthrough in the future?

**Lopes is the easy answer.**

Q11: Who do you feel has been your best and worst signing this season?

**Best: Fernandinho, Worst: Demichelis.**

Q12: As well as the academy, your owners have invested lots of money in the City, plan to expand the stadium, and have established a womenâs team along with establishing New York City FC and investing in Melbourne Heart FC. What have you made of it all, and in particular, how do you think the investment in Melbourne Heart FC along with the creation of New York City FC will impact on you as a club?

**I have no idea how it will impact City. I just have a team to keep track of in the MLS now, that's the only difference for me.**

Q13: What are your goals for the club next season?

**Just mount a serious challenge on all fronts. You can't win everything every year, I just expect the team to give a good account of itself.**

Q14: Which XI would you like to see your team field against us?

**Hart, Zabaleta, Kompany, Demichelis, Kolarov, Fernandinho, Garcia, Nasri, Silva, Yaya, Dzeko**

**Yaya pushed into a more forward role to support Dzeko as the lone striker.**

Q15: Finally, your predictions for the match?

**Football is always unpredictable, derbys are even worse. United have been pretty poor defensively in the games I've watched lately, but equally a moment from a player like Rooney or Mata could cause City some problems. I'm going to say 1-3 tentatively.**",0,1395587787,null,0,false,0,cg9s1vf,t3_21578t,t1_cg9s1vf,t3_21578t,null,1433031643,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

true,Homonavn,logo,,"1. Actually... I don't think another manager could have done anything different (Except ferguson ofc) When you look at the players United have, they just dont have the world class players. I think 6-7 place is actually a realistic for a team with players like United have.

2. I think United will end up in 7th place and go out of champions league now. Bayern will be to strong, and i think even the united supporters know that.

3. As a city fan, i have to say when dzeko scored the 6-1 goal... :)

4. I think Pellegrini has been great! I love his attacking style and as Toure said. He allows Toure to play more attacking and we can already see how that goes. 16 goals this season. I dont even want to think of winning the league. We a few hard games as you said, but i hope we do. Of not, i hope Liverpool wins it. 

5. I would say Toure actually. We have done great without Kompany for the last 2 games, but Toure has been absoloutely fantastic. Such a monster.

6. Hmm, difficult. I havent followed Serie A at all, so i dont know much about Jovetic. And we saw the amazing partnership Negredo and Aguero had, so im not sure. I have heard amazing thingd about Jovetic so we'll see. He wont start over Aguero tho, but maybe negredo.

7. I think Nastasic has been OK this season. His young, not much experience, and injuries as you said. He sure had that mistake against chelsea, but that was as much Joe harts mistake for not shouting. 

8. A manager that know math... JK :P Seriously tho, Time. This is the first time we have come out of the group stages, so i didnt expect us to win it this year. Next year maybe we will reach the quarters or maybe even semi's

9. I think we will continue buying top class players, because that is the easiest and best way. But dont say young players cant get a break trhough. Look at Marcos Lopes and dedryck Boyata. They have both player several first team matches this season, and they have done great

10. of course Marcos Lopes!

11. Best - Fernandinho by a mile! What a freaking player he is. Worst - Jovetic, simply because of Injuries.

12. More attention to the club around the globe...!

I love Lennon. He's a legend but the only thing he's got going for him right now is he covers his RB very well. He cuts in, dribbles all the way across and plays a short ball to the winger that's now covered by 3 players he brought with him and provides him with no space to move forward.  

People need to stop saying Lamela should start as well. He's yet to show us anything and he's been injured for months! If he does come back he'll be extremely rusty and not match fit.

Capitalism. Capitalism requires a certain amount of unemployed people in order to keep wages low due to competition. These unemployed people have been herded into the inner cities where they are trapped in poverty. The kids don't bother with school because they see the only way for them to make money is through crime and they're probably right considering people with degrees are having trouble finding work.

Our capitalist society has created these issues and they will only be overcome by moving away from capitalism. 

With major automation just round the corner, unemployment is going to increase dramatically. The government is already cutting welfare benefits but the fact is, welfare benefits will need to be vastly increased in the coming decades in order to stave off violent revolution by the tens of millions of unemployed.

It's not all doom and gloom though. Automation will break the current system and necessitate radical changes to our society.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I am a Northerner, this puts me in a much more informed position about the way we think, so don't talk like you know more about the people in my part of the country than I do when I live live here, because you don't.

'Thatcherism', the 'north south divide' and anything else you're talking about as a way to try and make out like Southerners and Northerners don't get on and that England is devided is something that is just a load of bollocks, these concepts just do not exist in the vast majority of peoples minds. Most people aren't even interested in politics and just think 'labour is the working mans party innit mate', until they hear about UKip and can easily be swayed toward UKip who is politically much more closer to Thatcherism, so that shows you how 'set in their ways' politically the majority of people are, which is not very at all. I'm a UKip voter and supporter and ex-labour voter, I've swayed about 10 or so people to UKip from labour so far. 

Besides, Thatcher was PM in the 70's and the differences between the North and South have absolutely fuck all to do with Scottish independence. 

And the recent riots were in Liverpool, Manchester AND LONDON YOU MUPPET. 

So, to sum up with your wrong way of thinking about Northerners, contrary to what the left wing media feeds you, most people don't care about politics but will take note if Scotland goes independent then they'll ask the obvious question 'why the fuck are they still using our money', then upon learning Scotland isn't paying for trident and wants to sell the oil they have outside the UK and keep more money from it, whilst reducing corporation tax to take businesses away from England, these Northerners will say 'they shouldnt be using our money at all, lets do everything we can to fuck them over'.

Don't forget that a copper's employment is laid down in regulation so once they've passed their probation, you're not going to be able to offload them when you realise that no matter how good a thief-taker he is, there's a reason he didn't consider becoming a sparky.

This isn't about changing a light bulb. It's about the costs involved in maintaining an increasingly elderly estate across the length and breadth of London. Unfortunately, rather than having a sensible debate about the costs of that (which would include a discussion of closures of stations, which is what the lawyer who kicked it all off was having a whine about), the Telegraph chose to focus on a headline figure of Â£100 to change a lightbulb, which fails entirely to take account of the nuances of a multi-million pound, 24/7 maintenance contract.

Does the met (and by extension, the people of London) get value for money from the existing contract? Good question. Can you base the discussion on a single figure given in respect of a specific question asked in an FOI request? Not so much, but that's never stopped the Telegraph from running a story with that as a source. At least they highlight that that's the charge for an emergency call out, but that's about all we can say.

I also used to work for a PR company who specialised in legal services, and I'm almost positive that we represented that lawyer. I smell a 'save our nick' campaign that's been pitched in to the Telegraph going by the lack of any real story.

Fuck that.  Fandom isn't about time, it's about understanding of culture.  City fans have a specific culture to them, generally stemming from our working class roots of Manchester.  You should look into our history a bit, ask a few questions and watch some videos on Youtube of our older games

The reason we dislike ""gloryhunters"" is because they fail to appreciate the rich history and culture of the Clubs that they support, they just watch 11 players on a pitch in a specific shirt and think they're big fans.  This isn't how it works.

There's lads on here like /u/ibpants who tell me that they're pretty new fans but are the perfect example of proper City fans.  They have thrown their energies into learning about City and Manchester and why we're intertwined, how our rivalry with United came around and why it's fierce, the rise and fall and rise of City over the years, etc.  They share humour because they understand our shared experiences, hopes and regrets.

Being a ""City fan"" is different from being a ""Spurs fan"" or an ""Arsenal fan"" or a ""Luton fan"".

It's not being rejected out of hand, or for any other reason than it's not a good idea for the UK.  It really is like they're covering their ears and shouting ""lalala""

&gt;This is also why you see near universal support amongst the Scottish parties for devolution, but not full independence. People aren't happy with the status quo, but they feel independence is a step too far.

For me, this is the best way.

You can absolutely be racist against the dominant racial group. Kriss Donald was the victim of a Racist murder, picked out because of the colour of his skin. The demographic numbers of his ethnic group does not negate this.

In fact, resentment caused by belonging to the largest ethnic group can often make you a target for racist abuse in minority communities.

Agger is completely out of position, he shows no discipline at all and gets dragged to the edge of the box and allows Mutch to run in directly behind him, look at where Agger starts out and where Mutch is when he taps the ball in, the same spot.  The reason Skrtel ""looked very shaky"" as you put it is because as the ball is being delivered into the box his partner wanders off and leaves him in the heat of the moment to mark 2 players and the space in front of the goal.

Looking at your post history, you're Danish, so it's clear why you won't place any blame on Agger.

true,GlassesAndMoustaches,logo,Merlin,"1. He's not had the best season has he? If he was at any other top 4 club I think they would have flung him by now, but recently he's started doing a little bit better for himself

2. 6th but definitely not higher. Maybe 7th if both Everton and Spurs have a good finish to the season. As for the Champions League, I suspect Bayern will hand you your arses on a plate

3. Favourite derby memory? Oh it has to be 6-1. Nothing was sweeter than Fergie's, the players and 60,000 fans' faces at the end of that match. Sheer brilliance.

4. I think Pellegrini has done well but still needs to adapt. It took him a while to realise clubs like Cardiff etc will give us a fight and at times his starting 11 has been questionable, but I don't think that can be helped with the amount of games we've had combined with the injury list.

5. Oh geez. That's like choosing one child or the other. I'm gonna go with Yaya being the in-disposable one, after all he's been scoring goals and that's how you win games. When we've replaced Kompany we've not done too bad but when Yaya isn't playing there's a gap. Imagine trying to cook for your missus' birthday but you've got one finger less.

6. Yes, I can see him starting frequently if he sorts his injuries out.

7. I'm not the clubs' physician so I can't help you there matey.

8. I think experience. It's not like we don't have the team, we do, but there's a doubt in the backs of our minds I think and it's holding us back. A fully fit Aguero could have helped in previous games

9. I couldn't be more excited for the academy. It's a fantastic opportunity for us to draw in players of the future and once teenagers want to come to us instead of us fighting for signatures we'll be raising (hopefully) the best players of future decades

10. Marcos Lopez is my top one. He's gonna be brilliant from what we've seen from him already. His pace, dribbling, vision, passing and finishing is all top class. He's gonna be an incredible player

11. Best signing, probably Ferna. Him and Yaya have really nailed our spine this season. Worst signing? Well I'm gonna say Demichellis although I would've liked to see more from Jovetic based on his price tag

12. I'm game for it all. The Melbourne thing was a bit of a shock and I'm still trying to get my head around it but as for NYCFC - whether that's political or not - I'm excited for the future partnership of the two clubs. Of course I hope we remain the primary focus, afterall, when I was back in school we were just little ol' Manchester City and I have quite a bit of attachment to that

13. Domestic treble &amp; a couple of youth players making it into the EPL

Probably yes and probably no.

He would not have cycled 24 hours non stop. You cant cycle that distance (I know, ive cycled 240 in one day) without a good few breaks. My actual ride time was about 17 hours, so over the full day I got about 5-7 hours of breaks.

Now, I suppose you could argue that tiredness might play a part, but unlike driving, your body is active, and blood pumping. It does keep you going in a way driving does not.

I really don't think you have much of a clue how much money will go into a low budget stand up show late night on BBC 2, but you seem to have an, ""anyone on telly must be a millionaire"" misconception that is almost childlike in its ignorance and naivety.


See BBC comedy tarrifs here:

http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/tv/how-we-work/business-requirements/tariff-ranges.shtml

3 hours of low budget comedy *will almost certainly* cost less than a million, and the equipment and labour costs alone will eat up the bulk of that.  There are over 40 different people listed in the credits, all of whom will need to be paid.  The budget for his latest series has also been cut to the bone, hence the reduction in sketches shot on location, and the fact they're clearly all made for next to nothing.

Also he declared he wasn't a millionaire here:

I reckon its because people will get loads of replies and only reply to 1 or 2. Unfortunately a shot-gun approach is going to be your best bet.

Heres something you might feel like trying that i've done myself in the past. I sometimes travel a lot for work, eg go stay elsewhere for 3 months while on contract. I used to try to find a place myself on gumtree but it was a huge pain in the ass. What i did once and now continue to do, is go on oDesk or another online marketplace and hire a local (as possible) virtual assistant and give them my requirements and let them find a place for me. The 3-4 times i've done it its worked out very well, very easy and saves hassle. So it might be worth trying it. You'd probably pay about Â£30 - Â£50 depending on how long it takes, but if you're really lucky you'll get one living in Edinburgh that would be willing to personally view the places for you.

I dont know if this is something you want to try but it might be worth a shot. I also reckon you'll get a lot more success by phoning places instead of email.

Are they? Pensioners fall into two broad groups: those scraping by on a basic state pension, and those who've managed to put aside some money and are now living off a company pension plus savings income.

The first group have been pretty much as hammered as anyone else with a low income, although pensions haven't been targetted as strongly as jobseekers allowance and so on. But rising fuel prices and high inflation mean there's a heavy pressure on what little income those OAPs have.

The second group have seen their savings income dwindle almost to nothing due to ultra-low interest rates, and even the last budget's ISA changes is going to make very little difference in that respect.

Also even if they're personally OK, most pensioners don't live in a social vacuum: they have grandchildren and can see directly how the younger generation has been affected by tuition fees, lack of job prospects and so on.

true,nesi13,lfc68,,"Just out of curiousity I decided do the math on how the English Premier League table would look like if there was a Bonus Point System in place. The bonus point system I made for the Premier league is similar to the one used in many rugby leagues around the world where teams get a bonus point for scoring 4 or more tries and can recieve a bonus point if they lose by 7 points or less.

To translate this system over to football I had to make some changes to the current point system, I changed it so that just as in the Aviva Premiership in rugby you'd get 4 points for a win, 2 for a draw and 0 for a loss.

The bonus points work so that if you score 3 goals or more you recieve 1 bonus point, and if you only lose by 1 goal you recieve 1 bonus point.

A win therefore can give at most 5 points, a draw can give most 3 points and a loss can give most 2 points.

This is purely made out of interest and I don't think there is any great need to implement a bonus point system in football, but it might encourage more teams to try and play more attacking and entertaining football, which is something we as fans all want to see!

It's interesting to see the US keeping such a close eye on Wales, although given the Snowden revelations and information previously published on WikiLeaks it's not all that surprising.

Quotes like:

&gt; Wales is 'not necessarily interested in producing energy/electricity for the rest of the UK'

and

&gt; âOn the other hand, Walesâ independent streak may cause friction with the UK. Many Welsh think the UK has already âmilkedâ Welsh resources without providing anything in return.â

are interesting.

Presumably the US is also aware there is still considerable ill feeling in parts of Wales about the flooding of [Capel Celyn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capel_Celyn) to provide a reservoir serving Liverpool and Merseyside?

Not to mention:

&gt; Cables posted on whistleblowing website Wikileaks, dating back to 2009, warned there was âconsiderable national pride among the Welshâ.

What should matter is whether they are doing their job fairly and effectively, and representing the views of their constituents and doing what's best for them in the long run.

true,bradleykurt33,null,null,"I'm a City fan, born and bred in East London, I've often been told this clouds my judgement on football but I'll provide the answers you're in search of. 

1) As for Moyes' performance in his debut season, I don't think too many football fans expected him to live up to Fergie's standards straight off the mark but I think he has been bullied a wee bit too much, though. That's not to say I haven't enjoyed seeing United's major decline, however. What this whole fiasco has done though is inspired an essay subject for my uni course of how much of an effect, as British football fans, we think a manager has on a team. 

2) I think United will be plopped in a gloomy 6th placed position after the end of gameweek 38. As for the Champions League, drawing Bayern Munich was not ideal. If any team can know they have the ability to beat anyone on their day, it's probably Manchester United. But without van Persie I wouldn't be a confident red devil going into the 2 fixtures as Bayern have already proven they can comfortably win in Manchester this season. I say Bayern will go through to the semi finals. 

3) ""And Silva volleys it forward brilliantly and put it on a plate for Dzeko again, it IS six!""

4) Just off the mark, as much as I want City to win the league and believe they deserve to above any other team by a mile, the trophy is going to Stamford Bridge. Apart from City I'd love for West Ham win it. Realistically, though I'd have to go for Liverpool as their awesome retaking of dominance from Everton and United means they deserve this icing on that cake in my eyes. 

5) Kompany for sure. He's the best CB in the world without any shadow of a doubt and a monumentally rare true, true leader. As we all know City love to play neat, 1 touch passing football and Vinnie starts this all off from the back more times than I can remember, best ball playing centre half since Beckenbauer and Moore roamed the world's football pitches I say. 

6) We love those small, wriggly, skillful players with great movement and powerful desire. Tevez, Aguero being some of the bet recent examples and I think Jovetic will fulfill his role and become a club hero.

7) There's something seriously fishy going on within the realm of our medical staff and practises. I don't understand how we've seen so many leg muscle injuries in just 1 season. A season that's not even over yet, in fact. As for his performances, solid as an iceberg. Consistently excellent. I've heard a lot from fans of various teams about him being the next Nemanja Vidic, but I don't believe this to be so - he'll be the first Matija Nastasic. He had a wonderful partnership with Kompany last season and I hope Pellegrini knows this as he'll be ital in everything we do next campaign. 

8) Time.

9) I think it's a great idea. There's no reason it can't rival Barcelona's calibre of youth development system. A lot of money has been put into this project and with Patrick Vieira spearheading the footballing aspect of it, I don't know about you but I'm excited.

10) Marcos Lopes, Jordi Hiwula, Devante Cole, Emyr Huws and a few others from the EDS side look class. I was most excited about Denis Suarez until he was foolishly allowed to join Barcelona last year. 

11) Best signing is a toughie. Fernandinho and Negredo have been outstanding and Jesus Navas has also put in some very good performances, scored several goals and gave us that pace on the wing that we'd been so desperately in need of for a few years before his arrival. Also, Navas has overcome his homesickness that allegedly blocked his transfer to Chelsea 5 or so years ago which I admire a great deal indeed. As for best signing though, Negredo I was confident in as a signing, I'd been preaching for 2 seasons that City desperately needed a true number 9 player which he is, probably why he wears the number upon his back and he hasn't let my amateur pundit's ego down. The partnership he's constructed with Kun, before his string of injuries this season has been undoubtedly stronger and more lethal than that of Suarez &amp; Sturridge or van Persie &amp; Rooney. As for Fernandinho, I was gobsmacked that we signed him when it first happened. Never played in England, had just, count 'em, 5 caps for Brazil and was the 'ripe' age of 28. His first 6 or 7 performances in friendlies and the league were woeful but since then he's evolved into a machine of a footballer. Interceptions, short and long passing, goals, strength, he's had it all. More importantly though, he's done it all season long apart from the aforementioned early stutters. Fernandinho is our best summer signing. 

12) This is why I'm so proud to be a Citizen. We are undoubtedly the people's club in England in my opinion. Off the top of my head (genuinely) here's a list of positive things City have spent their money on, apart from what you've already mentioned above:

- Free scarf with every purchase of a replica shirt at the start of the 2012/13 season
- Free sports bag with every purchase of a replica shirt at the start of the 2013/14 season
- Countless hospital and hospice visits
- Heavy and ongoing investment into The James Milner Foundation
- Funding CityTV, one of the best football club documentary series' around
- Inviting children in for training sessions with players including Clichy and Richards
- Relentless free competitions to win tickets to games, worn match shirts/boots, stadium tours, etc

This is part of the reason I love being light blue. 

As for the investment into Melbourne Heart FC and the creation of New York City FC, who knows really. Probably just going to be used as a version of academy systems, replacing Arsenal in the role.

13) Get further in the Champions League than we did this season.

14) Fully fit squad would be:

                                            Hart
               Zabaleta     Kompany      Nastasic     Kolarov

                                   Yaya   Fernandinho

                             Nasri       Silva      Aguero

                                          Negredo

...but taking injuries into consideration, my line-up would read like this:

                                           Hart
                        Zaba     Vinnie     Lescott    Kolarov

                         Navas    Yaya   Fernandinho   Silva

                                     Nasri
                                               Negredo


...the reasons I've gone for this being I think United's defence has been their weakest section of the team this season, been exploited so many teams by the likes of Liverpool and Tottenham even. Nasri is very direct and will constantly run the defenders and I don't think the lack of partnership in the United back line will be confident enough to deal with this. Nasri's ability to play a killer ball and his movement in the box isn't going to help their cause either. I would have liked to push Yaya Toure up into a more advanced position but I think against the big players like Fellaini, Carrick and Jones who may play in the centre of the park on Tuesday, Yaya's presence will be imperative. Navas and Zabaleta down the right hand side will expose either Buttner or Evra to the extreme, we'll get a lot of joy in that area. Aguero is out. As we all know, United just cannot deal with him. With the next best thing in terms of playing/attacking style, Stevan Jovetic, also being out, then I think Negredo's sheer physical, brute-like presence will be a pain for United's centre halfs with so much delivery coming for him from Navas and Zabaleta as I've previously alluded to. This will be 3 years in a row that City have won inside The Theatre of Dreams if the blues have their way which means extremely high stakes for both teams. 

15) Man United 2-2 Man City.

You know, this kind of allegation has been made many times before, but the fact is that new technologies tend to *create* jobs, rather than destroy them.

Take a look at the technologies that have been adopted by business over the last century - how many of them have genuinely reduced the number of jobs available in the economy? Very few of them.

* The word processor may have put typewriter operators out of work, but many more people use word processors today than were ever employed to operate a typewriter previously.

* The forklift truck has enabled the distribution industry to employ thousands more warehouse workers than was possible in the days of the manual porter.

* Lorries put the canals out of business, but there are more lorries on the road than there were ever boats on the canal.

Etc.

The point is that mechanisation leads to cheaper products and financial savings, at the same time as other technologies open up new sources of employment. As the last 200 years have shown, this does not tend to lead to rapid rises of unemployment.

That can be attributed to a growing global population, changing geopolitics (agricultural subsidies being a huge part of that), inflation, increasing wages in the developing world, supermarkets pushing expensive alternative products, and much more.

The recession not withstanding, the longterm trend is towards spending a much lower proportion of wages on food.

As opposed to the argument that ""things are going to change because I feel like it""? We have been automating increasingly complex jobs for that entire time period, why do you draw an arbitrary distinction now, and (more importantly) with self-checkout machines?

true,Rudas_Iskariot,logo,,"Q1: What have you made of how Moyes has done for United this season?

A: he has done good for being faced with an impossible task.

Q2: Where do you think United will finish in the league come the end of the season, and how do you think weâll do in what is left of the Champions League?

A: 6th or 7th... hopefully 7th. you guys are out in this round. 

Q3: We have played against each other many times over the years. What is your favourite derby memory?

a: Why Always me? sorry but that game happen on my birthday. 

Q4: How well do you think Pellegrini has done for you this season, and do you think you will win the league this season? Although you have a few games in hand, you also have three tough away fixtures coming up in the next four games. If you donât win the league, which club would you like to see win it?

A:He has done a great job at stabilizing our team and institutionalizing his offensive philosophy. I know he isnt going to be here for another 20 season, but a man can hope. 

Q5: Yaya Toure or Vincent Kompany. Who is the most important player to the team, as you have pushed over the edge into a top team regularly competing for the League?

A: Kompany. Our defense is pretty shit without him, our midfield is average to better than average without Yaya. 

Q6: Do you think Jovetic can become a permanent fixture in the starting lineup or will he be behind Aguero, Negredo &amp; Dzeko in the pecking order?

A: He will be the number 3 striker next year. and honestly should get as many starts and Aguero and Negredo because of rotation... as long as they all stay healthy. 

Q7: Nastasic had a great first season for your club, but this season has been blighted by injuries. What have you made of how he has done this season when fit, and why do you think heâs had so many injuries this season?

A: he took a step back this season. But i hope he can return to form next season. injuries are like shit, they just happen.

Q8: What do you think you need to make a bigger impact on the Champions League?

A: luck.

Q9: What do City fans think about the investment in the academy? Will that become a long-term benefit or will City continue to buy top class talent to the point youth can't break in (like Chelsea)?

A: I like the idea, but we have to see what happens in the next few years. we got a few promising youngsters that should break in.

Q10: Are there any youth prospects you have that youâre excited about/looking forward to perhaps see breakthrough in the future?

A: Rekik, Guidetti, Lopes.

Q11: Who do you feel has been your best and worst signing this season?

A: Fernandinho is the best. Navas... he should be getting more games than he is. its really hard to choose. a worse cause non have been bad. 

Q12: As well as the academy, your owners have invested lots of money in the City, plan to expand the stadium, and have established a womenâs team along with establishing New York City FC and investing in Melbourne Heart FC. What have you made of it all, and in particular, how do you think the investment in Melbourne Heart FC along with the creation of New York City FC will impact on you as a club?

A: brand awareness. the bigger we become the better the team will be. 

Q13: What are your goals for the club next season?

A: the league. semi finals champions league. and at least two trips to wembley. 

Q14: Which XI would you like to see your team field against us?

A: Hart, Zebaleta, Kompany, Demichelis, Clichy, Yaya, Fernandinho, Navas, Silva, Nasri, Dzeko.

Q15: Finally, your predictions for the match?

Here's the main shtick: despite everything, and how much everyone hates it, it *works*. Calls to existing donors in particular are extremely effective, and over the years the fundraising companies are paid for the effectiveness of a call to a donor rather than sheer numbers. For us, at least. I'm making these numbers up because I don't know specifics, but look at this way: it used to be that the company would get 1 or 2 euros per successful call to donors. What would happen was that their staff would convince people to sign up for 2 weeks and then cancel, which a lot of them did - this was disastrous. Now, they get their money after the donor has paid regularly for 3 or 4 months, and the company will get â¬4. 

That means: less pushy for the immediate sale, but extremely pushy to get you to comit to your regular donation. People don't like a guilt-trip.

I don't know what we're doing with Siggy and Chadli. Both want to play centrally, both have been mainly stuck out on the wing. But Eriksen has been stuck on the wing lately, too, so maybe that's just how we're dealing with having an excess of midfielders. I know people love Chadli on here now, but I think Siggy and Eriksen would be the two I'd keep of those, with Chadli mainly getting a specific winger role if he stays.

Carroll is still too incomplete to compete for me, but it'd be nice if we could get him a Premiership-level loan next season- somewhere like Norwich or even Leicester could be his making. We'll see how he goes after that.  
  
Livermore- man, it kinda breaks my heart to say it about the most passionate Spurs player in his youth days, someone who once replied to a interviewer asking how he felt playing against the best team in the world (Barca youth) with 'don't care, I already play for the best team in the world'... but we don't have space for him in the squad, and I don't think we've ever had really. If Hull want to pay properly for him, we should take them up on it.  

If we can break even (or at least near-even) on Paulinho and Capoue, I wouldn't miss them that much. They both do their job fine in a pinch but they're not really helping us much.

This sounds like a fairly cheap attack against an argument I wasn't making, I'd guess in the hope that other people read your post and lazily assume it to be true.

At no point do I suggest I'm giving a comprehensive reasoning to my answer. I begin with a concise answer to the question asked. I go on to comment on how I've perceived the Scottish attitude on the matter. Surprisingly, I haven't conducted a nationwide survey of Scotland to gauge everyone's opinions: my understanding was that other people will be doing that work for me.

What seems to have most confused you is that I both say how I'd vote, and then comment on how I feel about the result of their vote. Allow me to try and help. Notice that I say:

&gt; I'm entirely happy about them clearing off

Note the passive phrasing here - I'm not talking about an action on my part (i.e., I'm not saying ""this is why I'd vote no""); I'm talking about observing the results of others' actions.

I've even just alluded to me actually having reasons as to why I'd vote no - you must have missed it. Check it out:

&gt; since I believe they've got the better half of the union

Okay, onto the next question:

&gt; Why does it offend so much that as a country Scotland are asking themselves this question!?

Because, as I've said, I believe they're getting the better deal from being in a union with us. To then, very publicly, declare over and over that they should leave and do it alone - causing our parliament to beg them to stay - places the power in their hands.

---

I'm currently on a grandfathered plan with T-Mobile (from before they got bought by EE). I get unlimited internet (including tethering), unlimited texts, 300 minutes. The plan is Â£8 p/m (SIM only 12 month contract).

When I first signed up for the plan it was 1GB data limit &amp; 300 texts for Â£10.50 p/m. There must have been some sort of price-war going on at the time though, as they were doing an offer whereby you'd get an additional two free 'booster thingys' if you agreed to a 12 month contract rather than a 30-day rolling (The boosters were normally Â£5 each). The two I chose were ['Unlimited internet', and 'unlimited texts'](http://i.imgur.com/jLWoDGq.png).

After a year I rang to see if I could renew for another 12 months and I mentioned I'd been shopping around and jovially asked if there was anything they'd be willing to do to keep me a customer. They responded by offering to drop the price by a couple of quid and allowed me to keep all my previous perks.

SIM only plans are quite good for this sort of haggling though, since they can't use a shiny new phone as a carrot to get you to renew, and have to you offer something else instead (discount, more minutes, etc).",0,1395615528,null,0,false,0,cga3od3,t3_215byn,t1_cga3od3,t3_215byn,null,1433037188,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,kirkum2020,null,null,"Mainly one problem and it is reversible.  Everyone mentions how many pubs are closing but never say how many of them reopen shortly after.  Pubcos, the businesses that the breweries created to buy their pubs when they were forced to sell them off, have learned a particularly nasty trick.

Pubcos have learned that, in their smaller pubs, they can make more money from landlords than punters.  They know many people dream of becoming a landlord or landlady and are willing to spend a fair bit of money to do so.  They get tied into horrid contracts, expecting them to meet targets that the pubco can change at any time.  New people pay anything from a few to tens of thousands of pounds just to move in, then the pubco might get them to dig deep for any maintenance work or refurbishment.  Next, they'll start raising your targets.

Considering that, by being tied to one of these companies, the pub can only offer a very poor range of equally poor drinks at ridiculous prices, those targets will be impossible to make.  Either the landlord makes way for the next mug or the bailiffs move in.

I'm sure we could do the same to the pubcos as we did to the breweries if the political will was really there but these are enormous businesses with a lot of money so don't hold your breath.

He offers a sense of urgency in the midfield that Dembele and Paulinho lack. He reads the game well and seems to be involved in every tackle. He's also not afraid to make forward passes and transition into the attack. Additionally, he seems to be getting used to the physicality of the league and seems to routinely be shrugging off midfielders. Lastly, he has a pretty solid left foot- almost scored here and I remember the bar-rattler v CP a few months ago. He is a good player and I am really optimistic about him. He seems to thrive in the DM role, either in a pivot 4-2-3-1 or a more concrete 4-1-4-1. I prefer him over Capoue but not over Sandro, but if he develops a little more flair around the opponent's third, I could see him transitioning into a more attacking role and threatening Dembele, Holtby, Paulinho, and Sigurdsson's roles on this team. That said, and maybe I'm just getting carried away here or projecting, I would pick Bentaleb over any of them at the moment.

2. I think a late push for 5th isn't entirely out of the question. Bayern Munich will eliminate Utd from the competition.

3. Although a City fan, I cannot deny that the Rooney overhead kick was something to behold.

4. Pellegrini has been absolutely fantastic, kept the egos happy and the goals flowing. Shored up the defense somewhat too.

5. Kompany is the more important of the two for the mentality of the side. Yaya is the anchor of the team in midfield, but Ferna or Javi have shown they are capable of doing that. The skipper gives the defence confidence and he grabs a few important goals too.

6. Jovetic isn't necessarily paired with the strikers in my mind. I consider him to be competing directly with Aguero and Nasri, as he plays the CF role, can distribute as well as finish off moves. If my dreams come true and Dzeko doesn't leave, I still think he'll be waiting.

7. In time Matija will be considered to be a world-class centre-half, just needs the game-time. Pellegrini appears to be too fond of Demichelis although I understand his decision. Nastasic is one of my favourite footballers at the moment and will be for a long time. Hopefully his mystery injury will be sorted soon.

8. Experience combined with a consistent lack of injuries.

9. As long as the academy graduates and prodigies aren't sold off to the highest bidder like Denis Suarez was (to Barcelona B) then I think players like Marcos Lopes certainly have a huge opportunity to break in through cup games and establish themselves as senior footballers for the first team.

10. Marcos Lopes, Emyr Huws, Albert Rusnak.

11. Best: Jesus Navas - the injection of speed he brings really makes the difference in the final 30 minutes. Worst: Jovetic - purely for his injury troubles.

12. Very little impact at club level, but if these ventures overseas keep the owners interested in football and in the club then the money won't be disappearing any time soon. Good sign. Excited to see what NYCFC bring to the table.

13. The club has been engineered to be a trophy-machine, so the goal should be just that. Trophies.

14. Hart, Zabaleta, Kompany, Lescott, Kolarov, Yaya, Fernandinho, Milner, Silva, Navas, Dzeko.

15. A very rough match as always, either plenty of goals or barely any. Rooting for a 0-3 City win but these games are unpredictable.

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"1) The treasury didn't rule it out, actually. Neither did Osbourne, arguably. The phrase he used was ""as currently advocated"". Implying, albeit very loosely, that changes could be made allowing him to accept it. 

Another thing one must ask is, how far is the treasury informing the decisions of the government, and how far is the decisions of the government dictating what the Treasury says? The only non conservative minister of the treasury is Danny Alexander.

Additionally, wasn't their whole point that the currency union was unappitising, because the Union was superior? Would that not be invalid after a Yes vote?

2) True, but then the rUK public have hardly been informed on this issue, outside Westminster's ringing condemnation. If they were to been informed of the arguments on the other side, I am fairly certain there would be a lot more discussion on the issue.
And, if it became apparent *not* being in a currency union would cause rUK to lose jobs and money, I think they would gain a lot of favour by changing their mind (or at least, they would lose less favour than if they did not).

3) I find that to be unlikely, given it's widespread support amongst academics, government advisors etc. If it truly was a horrendous idea, as it would need to be to be dismissed by *all* parties, you would not see even a fraction of the support it has.

4) Didn't the Tories (the dominant figure in the relationship) also promise not to raise tuitions? Even then, that's besides the point, there are still plenty of campaign promises they have gone back on.

The proportion of people affected by 'cannabis induced psychosis' is less than 1% of all users. I believe it's worth noting that studies are unclear about the causal effect between cannabis and schizophrenia but it's very well documented that schizophrenia, including possible cannabis induced, runs in families. 

It's also worth noting that the number one cause, of the appearance of symptoms, of psychosis is stressful life events. 

Committing minor acts against the law even made it onto the [ Holmes and Rahe stress scale](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holmes_and_Rahe_stress_scale) (adult) as did things like arguing with parents (non adult) and simply being involved with drugs and alcohol (non adult). So whilst there may be a positive correlation with cannabis use and mental illness it does not equal causation. Cannabis also contains [CBD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cannaboidol) which has been shown to have antipsychotic properties but prohibition has left the breeding of cannabis in the hands of criminals who have mostly bread out the CBD in favour of plants which are higher in THC such as Skunk.

I'm pretty sure they would like that. I would like that, everyone would like that. I may be spoilt but I can still realise that there are people in tough positions and I'm all for people who have no control of the circumstances to be able to benefit from a system as great as the dole. However, people who come into the country at their own free will who don't have everything planned out and expect to take money from people who pay taxes and contribute until something drops on their lap don't really deserve the money. They still should prove they are willing to help others who need dole money by planning out their future beforehand, getting a job as soon as they reach here and then, after they have proven themselves, be able to acquire the dole of they need it. Once again, see German System.

&gt;You don't even realise how lucky you are to be in that position.

I understand that I'm in a lucky postition. But I still can't find a job and I'm not on the dole due to cicrcumstances beyond my control, age, current economy and most business' idea that all kids my age are party goers who wouldn't take their job seriously. 


&gt;I did. I said I'm going to treat you the same and provided an example of how that could go bad for you.

I don't think you understand. Oppersion in any form is wrong and I would never oppress anyone.


&gt;Yeah, that's not how it works. Take your jobless pampered arse down the dole and you'll soon learn that.

That's why their should be planning before hand before moving to any country at your own free will.

Really, we need four new spots, and three of them (DM, striker, left winger) are debatable. I'm still salivating over the prospect of a 4-3-3 with Lamela, Soldado, and Chadli up front, Sandro, Eriksen and Dembele in the other 3, and the defense will only improve and learn from their mistakes. If Kono comes in, I will be over the moon. If not, Chadli's ridiculously strong on the ball (There was a part in the Southampton game today where three defenders were holding him back. He just kept going, it was really something.). I'd argue on needing another midfielder who can create chances, as Lamela will (hopefully) be getting more minutes next season. 

I wish Tim Sherwood didn't have to leave for Van Gaal to come in. Sad that he won't be with us next year, because he's got a chance to become a top manager in the league. He's learning. We did a fairly good job with breaking down their defense today, something that was frustrating a few weeks ago.
