The Social Security Act had to amended to reflect the right of EU citizens to access state benefits.

Since it's kind of hard to give advice without knowing the question, I'll just summarise some of the general advise that I've been told that is helpful for this exam:

1. For Of Mice and Men there is a part a) and b). The 30 marks for the question are distributed over these two parts, and my English teacher has generally recommended that more time is spent on a) since it tends to be in more detail on the mark scheme. Also since the 30 marks are distributed over the two parts, it generally means it's not a big deal if one part's answer is slightly shorter than the other.

2. Going back to that guy's videos, he uses his own method to work out what the questions are likely to be about. Last year he did successfully predict what the Literature questions would be about. This year he has predicted that the question will be on Curley, so it's probably worth making sure that you know about Curley, but obviously he could be wrong this time with the guess, so I'm also going to be making sure I know about the others as well.

But for part b where you refer to the whole novel, have a short introduction, but make sure you give a point in it; don't just state what you're going to do, otherwise you're wasting time. 

Something rather irritating about English is that there isn't a 'set' amount you should do really. Just do what you can in the time given to you in the extract and in the part b of OMAM. As a rule of thumb (though don't stick to this as an iron-clad guide; I've gotten A* on less)  you should try to do about 2 sides for part a and about 3 and bit for part b. But you can do well on less. Remember social historical context too- that's vital. I predict that something on Carlson/Curley will come up or a key point in the novel (the end description, for example), and it might be linked to the whole 'dog-eat-dog' idea. But this is just a guesstimation.

Sure, it's nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, most buy back clauses would be fairly stupid without them since they would create an incentive  for the buying club to flip the player as fast as possible for as large a fee as they can get before the selling club gets around to activating the clause.

If Bayern just set a buy back clause at x amount, then Leverkusen will have a great incentive to sell Can to anybody for any amount larger than x, since otherwise they risk losing the player for just x at any point. So, other clauses are inserted that state something like ""Leverkusen must pay x% of any transfer fee (or an specific amount) to Bayern if Can is sold to any club"" or something of the sort.

Clubs sometimes insert clauses like that to prevent players from moving to rivals or to other teams in the same country. They don't get much publicity because they are almost never triggered.

More energy independence. In terms of national security America is in a far better position than European countries because much of their fossil fuels are extracted in their own country, or imported from Canada/Mexico. They have no nutty superpower dictating whether they can keep the heating on next winter. 

Iceland is a red herring, they're an outlier that can't be copied because their geographical location is unique. No other country could rely purely on geothermal like they do, for obvious reasons. Germany is a good example of renewables of course, but it's not as if they don't still heavily rely on coal for a lot of their electricity, and for heating they still rely on gas/coal just like we do. 

As with any fossil fuel extraction, it means big bucks for the government. Even minus all the subsidies that the government throws to their chums, it still brings in a lot of potential money for the government.

Hardly ""nothing positive"". I think national security concerns trump a few ""unsightly"" concerns any day. The greenhouse gases are of course concerning, but it's not as if the gas that we currently import is very green either.. It will take decades to be able to generate enough heating with renewables, what we need right now is fracking that is regulated and the gas being used in this country.

All loans are to fellow UK residents and mainly used for car and home improvement loans cheaper than a bank. Your money will be lent in £10(£20?) chunks to as many different people as necessary to invest your money. Speed-wise I recently managed to put in £3000 within a week. Even if one of these people end up defaulting on your money the ZOPA-wide 'backup' pool covers your loss[3].  

Alternative: RateSetter  

You could consider much higher risk business lending but I wouldn't recommend to someone who isn't already invested elsewhere. Risk is a lot higher and often there is no insurance pool or much in the way security when businesses fail. Returns are approx. 6% (estimated net of bad debt) at Funding Circle and more like 10-12% at sites with security.

&gt;That's what in hell, not the nonsensical what the hell. 

For starters: you're being incredibly pedantic about something that doesn't matter in the slightest. Also, you're not even correct. ""what the hell"" is the more commonly used expression, but they're interchangeable. In any case, ""what in hell"" hardly makes any sense either. Moving on,

&gt;Your assertion  is that it doesn't matter how the world behaves, so that you will not compare other standards to your own, only how you are affected.

That's still nothing to do with nepotism. Nepotism means someone powerful favoring  their family and friends. I'm saying that I disagree with the countries that allow drawn child porn, and my decision won't be influenced by them.

&gt;What determines mental capacity other than age?

Dude, it's been *proven* that **most** children have a lower mental capacity than **most** adults. It's obvious to anyone with a thread of common sense anyway. Not all, I'll grant you, but by and large kids can't handle things in the way adults can.

&gt;I'll bet you refuse any objective qualifier (such as learning or IQ).

Learning and IQ have no bearing on the maturity of a child to deal with this sort of situation. Like it or not, they're still children. Their brains are still growing. Do you think it is OK to have sex with children too, as long as they have an IQ over 130?

&gt;When I was 11 and 12 I went to college with 18-yeareds, and qualified for every entry-level class.

Of *course* you did. Why am I not surprised... Are you /u/DarqWolff's alt?


Also: It's my turn to be a pedantic arsewipe. That's ""18 year olds"", not the nonsensical ""18 yeareds""

&gt;You can only project your shortcomings onto everyone.

Sick burn bro! /s

&gt;You can't treat this as intellectual property or privacy case as you believe youth are property without a mind, will, say, or sake. Therefore you will interject yours onto them, talk of and down to them without theirs, and misrepresent and libel them.

No, I can't treat this as intellectual property because it's CHILD PORN, which is a completely different thing, like it or not. It affects people in a completely different way. I'm not even going to respond to your accusation of ""misrepresenting and libeling"" children.

&gt;That's what I mean; you aren't them nor like them. You don't pretend to know or care about them, only of your own feelings.

Seriously? If I didn't care about children I'd let pedos wank over them all day. Of course I fucking care about children. I know how children deal with problems they don't understand because I've *been a child myself*.

&gt;psycho is expected to mean psychopath

You're just being a dick. Language evolves.

&gt; Pædo- doesn't mean child-; it means kid-

Does it matter, they both mean the same thing in English.

&gt;A child is someone born, to a parent, a son or dauhter

You're just being a dick, child can mean ""someone who's not yet an adult"" too.

&gt;A grownup is a child

In a specific context, yes. For the most part, no.

&gt;A filo is a friend

[Filo can also mean ""lover""](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-phile).


&gt;Therefore a pædofilo is a kidfriend

Right, let's straighten something out here. We speak modern English. We don't speak Latin, or Greek, or Middle English. ANYONE who uses the word ""pedophile"" means someone who is sexually attracted to children. Therefore, that's what the word means. Full stop. Your fucking etymology nonsense and lingual gymnastics is totally beside the point. You knew exactly what I meant, and calling me out on something that I didn't even do wrong is simply being a dick.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;54 where deployed but we lost a total of 6 planes and only 6 where shot down not by enemy aircraft but ground to air defences.

A situation in which very highly trained pilots flying at the time modern aircraft with the latest weaponry engaged poorly trained pilots who were, by the time they reached the AOE, low on fuel, often without any missiles to defend themselves with, and largely flying 30 year old aircraft which lacked upgrades due to various embargos.

Furthermore, you'll find that the Sea Harriers only took out 21 aircraft. A notable achievement, but not anywhere near the number you quote, especially not when you consider that a large number of the aircraft they went up against were virtually defenseless.

&gt;So yes other than it's successor the F-35

Ah so you've begun to backpedal. That's a start.

&gt;it is the best air to air dog fighting

Absolutely not. That's just utter nonsense. The harrier is a small, slow, hard to fly aircraft which pales in comparison to contemporary lightweight dayfighters of its era in terms of dogfighting. The F-16 being an easy go to example of what is, one against the other, a superior dogfighting aircraft. If you don't like that example, there are many, many others.

&gt;and bombing fighter jet

Again, absolute nonsense. The damn thing didn't even have a radar! As I've already said the harrier II was small, slow, and unstable. Furthermore it had extremely limited fuel range, an extremely limited capacity for carrying munitions at only 3600 kg, was limited by it's 8 hard points in the number of munitions it could carry and still carry A2A missiles, and even by it's retirement couldn't carry a lot of the modern targeting pods, stand off cruise missiles, and modern air to air missiles that an aircraft needs to be effective in the modern age.

&gt;that has been around in the last 20 years.

Again, this is just utter nonsense. I've already pointed out the flaws in the Harrier II, but to suggest such an absurd thing when aircraft such as the F-15C/D and F-15E exist, when the F-22 exists, when the Rafale, Eurofighter, and Gripen exist, when the J-10, Mig-29, and Su-27 exist - man...you're taking patriotism to an idiotic level.

The Harriers were old. They were, essentially, based of an aircraft which first flew in 1960. They had limited carrying capacity, they were hard and dangerous to fly and even more so to land. They had short range and they couldn't even hit Mach 1. They had shit avionics and they couldn't carry most modern munitions. 

The Harriers weren't viable because the military was given a choice, cut the harrier or cut the tornado. The Tornado was doing good work in Afghanistan helping out the troops on the ground. I don't care if you agree or don't agree with the war in afghan, the military doesn't get to decide what wars to fight in, and what they need to look at is helping out the troops to the best of their ability. The harriers were described as ""utterly, utterly useless"" by Major James Loden from 3 Para in a leaked e-mail, echoing many a rumour from boys on the ground which was that they just weren't useful out there.

Something had to be cut, and the harrier was cut earlier than intended because something had to be, because the military couldn't afford to keep everything it wanted to, and because they weren't very effective at doing the job which they needed to do at the time.

Quoting an earlier post of yours:

&gt;Yet the US bought them all in a instant.

Yes. They did, because the US fund their military more than we fund ours. We didn't get rid of them because we didn't *want them*, we got rid of them because we *had to get rid of something*. The US bought them for replacement parts, and were pleasantly surprised to find that some of them were actually in quite good nick, but the sad thing is is that the US Marine Corps, underfunded as it is, can afford to keep harriers going in spite of their cuts, and our entire military couldn't. The Marines bought them for the exact same reason that in an ideal world we would have kept them: The F-35 isn't ready yet and until it is, not having a VSTOL aircraft means having a gap in capabilities, but as I say the difference between them and us is that US taxpayers don't mind funding their military and UK taxpayers do.

I think that'll do for the time being. I can go on and on if you've got more objections....",0,1400525887,null,0,1400526117,0,chlytss,t3_25w1f3,t1_chlytss,t1_chlm9is,null,1433865753,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I'm quite left wing - though I have no issues with a mixed socially responsible attitude to business and capitalism. I say these things because having gone from an avid member of Labour I've lost all hope that you'll be the party we need

Actually, no ,you pursuit of Blairite policies is slightly deluded and I apologise for using the word but it's what fits . The reason you're getting panned is because you didn't purge the entire Blair-brown era cabinet from the front benches. That's what you should have done. All of them out and start again. 

You needed to look like you weren't led by a bunch of Oxbirdge grads who's main occupation seems to be trying to be spads, and shagging other spads. You didn't even try.

This is simply because you were so enamoured with the 3rd wayism and success of the Blair years that the deep structures of the party moved far away from what they were. You were no longer a party for challenging for your core beliefs but a party that was convinced it had found an election winning formula and was determined to stick to it. 

You were being warned as far back as 2003 that the heartlands were dying and you were losing touch with the actual concerns of voters. You ignored it. It's not so much the socialism  but the refusal to let the party be a reflection of its members rather than a club for mates.

You also ignored the inexorable logic of the 3rdwayism that you had adopted. If you're going to adopt the neo-liberal policies of 3rdwayism then it's going to lead to a neo-liberal polity because you actively stifled the opposition to it from the left. You not only failed to look for ways of ameliorating the effects of these policies but you actively pursued a policy of crushing any attempt to find an alternative. 

In some way you were left with no choice in 2010 but reap what you sowed. A front bench of well meaning people who had been brought up terrified of thinking differently and totally disconnected from the party the wanted to lead. 

You also seem very confused about the difference between pro-business and sensible policy versus complete capitulation to a narrative that gives all the reigns to the free-market.  It is entirely possible to be pro-business and demand that workers get the best treatment. It is entirely possible to have a efficient and well run public sector organisation instead thinking that the only option is to privatise. 

You had a failure of imagination and a failure of nerve. 

Worst of all the policies that you did adopt have created a City-state, a virtual caste system in our professions and political classes, opening the door to a period where we are heading towards a Downton Abbey Britain. 

Labour was founded to end these things. It was suppose to be able to let a little working class and boys be able to dream about doing whatever they wanted.  It was about letting the council worker think that the could join the party and become PM. 

You lost the vision, and you left us with no hope. The UKIP and these fascists now rising. It's your fault. 

Feel free to PM me if you want to continue this discussion. I would be happy to talk to you about all this.

In the end though (and by the end too - I ended up correcting loads of silly mistakes with only minutes to spare), I was able to get answers which I think will hold up pretty well under the cold, authoritarian eyes of the unfortunate sod who gets to mark my papers.

The 6 mark questions were thankfully straightforward, and I think I did quite well on them (however I didn't outright state the words 'terminal velocity' in the P2 cyclist question so I'm not sure whether I got all the marks on that one). The maths questions often didn't involve much besides some rearranging in P3 as well, so I think I got plenty of good marks for those.

Overall, I'm hoping high 40's for both, which, assuming that last year's grade boundaries don't change by much, should be enough to get me 100 UMS on both P2 and P3, which is exactly the sort of thing I need to get an A* overall.

As for the bullet in his chest… well his regenerative energy is slowly breaking down the bullet, but as it's so close to one of his hearts it's about to give him a heart attack and kill him all over again. The only way he could speed up the natural regenerative process was by increasing his heart rate… and I think we know how he did that!

My husband received a very good job offer from the West Midlands. That's why we ended up landing UK. I have been living in UK for almost 6 months. Everything is new to me here. I took a while to adapt the culture and environment, and to wait for the paperwork done in Home Office. Honestly, It wasn't easy at all. I feel lonely and frustrated sometimes. On top of it, I am going nuts with my job hunting.  

However, I do like to live in UK and I like people here. Everyone is nice, chatty, relax and helpful. I do not feel stress to get along with the locals. 

I understand that being able to understand the English accents and communicate effectively with the locals is a golden key for me to keep on my profession. Does anyone have any ideas that can help me to improve my English? I grew up in one of the UK colonies. However, my English is not lively. It is liked textbook English. I can read and use difficult vocabularies. However, It is hard for me to write a lively and colourful English sentence. I guess this is the reason why my English isn't good enough. It is true that being a social worker is more than professional knowledge. It is about how you get along with the clients you work with, understand their needs, make them feel comfortable being around you and willing to share their problems with you. I keep pushing myself to work on my English. So that, i can communicate with the locals effectively. 

I do not like to sit at home and be a housewife. Being able to work and help others who are in need gives me a great satisfaction of my life. I do not want to be a useless person just because I can not fit in UK. 

I am really happy to receive many useful and positive comments here. I can map my career plan easier. ",0,1400529844,null,0,1400530155,0,chm0oqu,t3_25vhh4,t1_chm0oqu,t3_25vhh4,null,1433866631,0,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,0

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Yeah I know, and few people seem to question the whole ""fracking is evil"" mantra.

The problem is that the few of us who actually have a clue about any of this stuff work in the oil industry, and as you saw further down the shrill cry of ""shill"" emantes from just about anyone who encounters opposition to their dogma, especially from anyone who works in the industry.

It's the exact same tactic that climate change deniers use to accuse scientists; *""Well they're climate change scientists so they're just saying climate change is happening because they want to get more research money so we can't trust their results""* (ergo let's completely discount the expert information and believe what suits our agenda).

&gt;It's even more disheartening when you find out that this is seemingly the most dominant view of fracking also.

It is rather worrying. Many of my friends and family have talked to me and I've explained about it to them, they know I'm a guy who does care about the future of our environment so they trust my answers, however in general most people are just swallowing the green agenda of fracking = murder. I even made a big thread on here doing my best to explain fracking in a neutral manner, and that was received better than expected but of course I was called a shill and several people were quite sure that their ""I read it on the interwebs"" information was more accurate than someone who helps extract oil for a living.

&gt;It's even more disheartening when you find out that this is seemingly the most dominant view of fracking also.

They *are* the biggest audience. The internet and 24/7 news have left people thinking that they're informed, rational, and intelligent.

Far from it. I believe a global free movement regime would make the world a better place.

Until then, the very equitable free movement regime we have in the EU will have to do.

We paid £10 for a tennis court for an hour. It's so busy that you have to book in advance, and you get exactly one hour, not a minute longer. The courts were a bit run down, with weeds growing at the edges. At my local park, it's £5, the courts are much better, and you get to stay on longer most of the time.

We went climbing, which cost about £20. We were in a group of about 12 so only got to go up and down a couple of times.

If you can say that one group of people, based on their ethnicity have a significant statistical predisposition to be involved in criminal activity, and we should make our policy block them because of their race.  You've strayed into very nasty prejudiced territory.

Yet at the same time, it's a great time saver.

The problem is that a lot of people on the pro-immigration side are determined to say anyone who voices any concerns about this a racist, rather than trying to understand the motivation for those who are calling for *tighter controls*.

Ultimately people who believe in more open borders (such as myself) have to acknowledge that it will come with a cost.  Not try and pretend otherwise.  This is part of the problem that we've had for the last decade and a bit, anyone who voices a concern about immigration, is shouted at as a racist, even when they are just a protectionist.  For many people we've cheapened the word.

One of my neighbours is now almost proud to call himself a racist.  He feels his views have been labelled racist when they weren't, his experiences of crime have only been at the hands of two sets of eastern Europeans.  This makes it awkward if I'm talking to him with my non UK girl friend present.  He doesn't like how his area has changed, that is a fair enough attitude to have, it doesn't make you wrong, xenophobic or intolerant yes, but because he feels his voice is shouted down so much as *racist* I think he feels it's OK to have that label applied.  The danger is, that if you don't engage with someone like that, explain why they are being wrong, rather than labelling them thus, they will not change their minds, instead they will behave how you label them such.

People don't look at issues such as housing and migration (often internal rather than international), what was the stat, something like a 1.4% population rise in London's Tower Hamlets resulted in a 10+% average rent rise.

It's very difficult, and ultimately, I think it is fair to say that the large numbers we saw move in the last decade, many (xenophobic they might be) did not feel integrated how they would have liked, some feel displaced, others just don't like change.  That doesn't make them a racist.

They weren't for sale, they weren't trying to set a new trend for hipsters. They were simply using a mannequin to emulate one of the protagonists to advertise the movie.
It was slightly in poor taste, and even that's subjective. It's a touchy subject. It was a terrible part of history, but I think that actually *taking offence* to this is ridiculous, and a little bit pathetic if I'm honest with you",0,1400533663,null,0,1400533868,0,chm2evx,t3_25xkxp,t1_chm2evx,t1_chluo24,null,1433867451,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
true,Cormax,king,,"Poch's win % really does concern me. His time with Southampton has only given him 23 wins, 18 ties, and 19 losses, which isn't exactly impressive compared to de Boers 59% wins in all competition, and 65% in the league. Poch also lacks european experience, something that a lot of people seem to forget. We need a manager who knows how to effectively rotate players for both league and euro matches, another thing de Boer has experience with. While Poch's style of attacking football will fit us better, he simply doesn't seem up to the standards that spurs should be looking for.
 
But honestly either manager will be great, and sometimes experience isn't everything. Poch will be looking to prove himself at a higher level, which could be something that spurs could benefit from.

I think people have racism figured backwards . It is racist not to hire someone, or let your flat to them because of their origin. It is not racist to condemn another culture as not equal to yours. 
the thin line to walk is to be able to step away from cultural relativism while not discriminating against any individual. some people solve this by falling towards the first side. (saying all cultures are equally good. even the ones that eat children.)

true,ThrowerOfTantrums,null,null,"Would just like to echo the point made by /u/dpash regarding employment status. Where you effectively act as an employee, you cannot claim that you are self-employed and there is not choice to be made. HMRC apply a number of tests which have been created through case law to determine employment status (do you work specific hours, on specified days, at a certain location? Does the company provide you with equipment? Etc.)

If the company that you intend to work for/engage with is offering you a contract where you can decide if you want to be an employee, or to be self-employed, I would suggest that you read up on self-employment status on HMRC's website. If HMRC find that you have declared yourself to be self-employed when you're actually an employee, this can result in fines and penalties. I have had to deal with the aftermath of a company offering people the choice and, for most of the people involved, there was no such thing as a happy ending. Where employers offer YOU the choice of being an employee or self employed, it would imply either: they do not know much about employment taxes and do not seek professional advice when they really should, or they intended to minimise their tax/NIC liabilities from the outset, is a fairly dodgy company and you should steer clear. 

Happy to explain more about IR35 or self employment tests if you need more information (although I specialise in employment taxes, I would suggest seeking advice if you proceed further, whether it's from a professional advisor or calling HMRC on a ""no names"" basis).

Also we'd have UK views represented on the international stage rather than EU views which are often not in the UK's interests.

The cons are that the EU represents a significantly larger trading bloc and as such has arguably more influence than the UK would alone (I say arguably because disagreements within the EU often undermine it's stance and the UK punches way, way above it's weight in diplomatic matters, significantly more so than any other state). The EU may well wish to punish the UK for exiting it and may attempt to make things more difficult for the UK as a result (even if it is against the EU's best interests). If you are a supporter of the EU, anothe rnegative of Britain leaving is that it might start the ball rolling for other states potentially leading to the end of the EU project. The end of free settlement abroad may be more of an inconvenience although with Schengen I don't imagine that there would be a noticeable change for most travellers. Finally, some multinationals may decide to leave the UK, although any properly managed business will instead hedge their bets and see how things go before deciding - but if the EU decides to punish the UK enough it is conceivable that some may follow through with relocating from the UK to the EU.

The guy who I initially responded to was trying to call everyone here out for basing their opinions on Can on YouTube videos and FIFA/FM while also insulting the people here for acting like they know about Coutinho. Coutinho and Can are on different levels of notoriety and accomplishment, for me.

To add more idiocy to the party, this same person then went on to explain how his opinion of Can--gleaned from a friend of his who watches Leverkusen (lol)--was that he was a good talent, and all the people who just watched YouTube videos were wrong.

In any case, I never thought It'd be so divisive to point out that Coutinho was very well known when we bought him.

While I won't dispute your point (the 'rate' for various offences like red-light jumping is roughly the same for bikes and cars, I believe), what a good many people seem to fail to take into consideration is the risk or danger produced in either case. They see a rule breaker and get irked without seemingly acknowledging that the motorist is putting others at risk while the cyclist is probably only going to be putting themselves in danger.

That doesn't dismiss the rule-breaking, but it should highlight the disparity of both attention and annoyance directed at cyclists who are, in the end, most likely going to be the ones who are hurt through their actions.

As time goes by the old isolationist Brits will be outnumbered by younger less nationally self-absorbed people. It's very hard for Brits who think of the rest of Europe like somewhere totally alien to understand why anybody would feel any affinity for such people when they've never been anything but a tourist in respect of these people. When you meet with, work with, study with and socialise with any person of another nationality I find you can't help but notice the commonalities and feel like we're the same but live in separate places. Until you have that experience and you make those connections it can't be possible to feel part of a European union in any sense. I find it quite offensive when they pretend like they speak for us all when they say or imply that Britain and British people are naturally averse to integrating with Europe. I don't feel that way and I get the feeling that if some British people were a bit better travelled, a bit less culture sensitive and a bit more interested in other European countries (not as nice places to visit but as our neighbours, often our ideological counterparts on the world stage and part of our shared cultural heritage) we'd all be a bit less scared of European integration. 

We have a lot more in common with our fellow Europeans than with China and although we have a lot in common with the US, that relationship has been pretty one-sided, based on militarism and is naturally skewed towards the richer, more powerful nation with the safest economy in the world. Our best geographical, social and economic ally is Europe and the future battle of super powers between the US, China and whoever else is not going to be a nice place for an isolated Britain. A Britain that has it's foreign and defence policy decided totally by the US, it's trade relying on poor third world countries in the Commonwealth and our workers rights decided by the US corporations (like Pfizer) which would inevitably colonise the country starting first in London putting pressure on the government to change the law or threatening to leave. We'd exist as an offshore tax haven for the US, a 51st state whose only economic imperative was to be a financial centre for the Anglosphere. The traders and finance execs would be in heaven and the rest of the country would suffer. I know I'm probably on the pro-European fringe, even of this sub, but I cannot see how the context of international relations in our part of the world can be anything but European. It was of course within the context of European integration that Portugal, Spain and Greece overthrew their dictatorships in the knowledge that they could never be allowed into the EU unless they were genuine democracies and it has been the European context that has prevented territorial spats and ethnic conflict such as Catalonia or Basque from becoming tribal within the EU borders and it is the best chance we have or sorting out the mess that is Cyprus. It is of course the very fact that Serbia wants to become part of the EU that means it is willing to talk about peace and the succession of Kosovo as it has in the last year or so. You can and should argue about the semantics, about who has power in the union and how can it be as democratic as possible but separating ourselves from the greatest stabilising force on the continent is not the way forward.

&gt;What this means is that, unlike an American carrier, with its mix of fighters, electronic warfare and AEW aircraft, Britain's new flagships won't be able to project force as their aircraft, and the ships themselves, will be so vulnerable to attack. The only airborne asset they can operate is the F-35B and helicopters. So, if they go to war they are toast.

true,IAmNotAmerican,cnty-expat,I don't belong here,"&gt; It is not racist to condemn another culture as not equal to yours.

No - it's imperialism, formed from a nasty habit called colonialism that the British developed through the 1500's to 1900's and even now as they relent their former colonies the attitude remains.

The only thing more depressing than dressing up imperialism as some kind of respectable opinion is the adoption of it by other cultures that were once the targets of it themselves.

There is no difference between a person born on British territorial soil and a person born on Romanian territorial soil (outside of obvious environmental factors). Conflating immigration with crime only ever makes sense if it was 100% proven that closed borders prevent all crime. However we know that is ridiculous - there are British criminals that operate in British territory.

What the anti-immigration camp seem to be saying is that they want to ensure if a British person is going to be mugged, then it should be a British mugger doing the mugging.

If a black person commits a crime, the race is considered only for identity, and not as a precursor to the crime. If a Romanian person commits a crime, then it should only be considered for identity and not as a precursor to the crime.

People who fear Romanians living next to them are no different from people who fear black people living next to them - it is the fear of someone different from you and possibly built up by negative perceptions reinforced by the media.

Laws built on fear, rather than provable guilt, are terrible laws.

**edit (for the downvoters):** The kind of attitude that you have, that British culture is better than 'X' culture, is exactly the attitude that leads to countries starting illegal wars and claiming a 'moral superiority' and view themselves on a righteous mission to set the other culture straight. It leads to the kind of logic that says,

*""Sure we started an illegal war, we torture, but we're the good guys; we have a great country and ultimately they will adopt our culture and thank us for it!""*

If you take that view, then you share the philosophy of Tony Blair and George Bush - the view that because you view your country as being some sort of world-leader, then you have the divine right to set other countries straight, meddle in their affairs or treat the people of those countries as though they are some kind of second-class citizen, not entitled to the same protections and treatment as yourselves.

I'm an ex recruitment consultant and the best advice I can give you is not to target a specific agency. There are thousands upon thousands of agencies and the smallest two man agency could land you your dream job, it has nothing to do with the fact an agency sponsor an F1 team or have a great ad campaign. 

The single best thing you can do is to make yourself available to every single agency by means of the top job sites. 

Reed, jobsite, jobserve are the key ones to use. Any agency worth their salt will pay for one or all of these boards. By uploading your CV you sit right at the top and any agency with specific keyword alerts will be straight on the phone to you and any searches of keywords will have you at the top of the pile too. 

However:

Make a cover letter on your CV and specify EXACTLY what you want. It may sound big headed to do this, but believe me, a recruitment consultant will call you to gather information if they don't have a job for you. They want your old manager as a reference, but they only want a name to call and ask for jobs, as they know you recently moved and therefore there is probably a job vacancy there. 

Make the cover letter like this:

Dear Recruiter,

I am looking for &lt;insert what kind of jobs you want&gt;

I was previously earning £x

I am looking for no less than £x

The benefits I would like are;

My notice is x months

I am looking to work in x, y, z regions and can travel x miles from home and no further. 

I do/do not wish to work away from home

I do/do not wish to work in London

I am happy to provide references if an offer of employment is made to me. 

Please only contact me with job opportunities suited to the above criteria. 


---


I know it sounds snotty, but if you have a decent CV your phone won't stop ringing and you'll get fed up and lose hope/sanity. 

These cover letters provide all the information a recruiter should ask you, but sparing the info you shouldn't be giving them, such as your last manager's name and a colleague who can 'vouch' for you.

Don't let your CV get fired off to whoever the agency see fit. Keep reigns on it and make notes as to who has sent it where. There's nothing worse that having two agencies submit your cv to the same job and then dealing with that, whilst making the recruiting company think you're not even capable of remembering who is handling your CV. 

Always reiterate your desired salary. An offer almost always comes below your requested salary and most of the time it's because the recruiter decided not to stress your minimum. 

PM me if you need any more advice. Recruiters are great, as they do all the legwork finding great jobs, but it's all about keeping them in check and not letting them use you as a source of information and not getting you a job.

Not ticking the box basically gets your application thrown in the trash without further reading. 

The only examples where the claim can be made that there are no EU citizens able to do the job are generally elite scientists, specialist advisers, that sort of thing.

The exception would be marrying a British citizen, but you'd still need to answer a lot of questions about your marriage (how long you were together, how you met, etc) to demonstrate that this wasn't for immigration purposes. Having a child with a British citizen will get you in to Britain with a free pass to citizenship, but obviously this is more of a commitment than you're looking for.

Have you lived in Roma culture for a comparative time to living in British culture? If you have then I will accept your assertion based on first hand experience.

However if you have not, then your view is subject to cognitive bias - namely that you prefer British culture because you have not experienced Roma culture* (apart from what you've likely experienced 3rd hand through media) and so your bias is driven by a sense of national pride and feeling, rather than objectivity.

I have spent time in a number of cultures and can tell you from first hand perspective that British culture is by no means superior - it is in a state of confusion and catch-up with other cultures around the globe - yet in constant self-denial and conceit about it's own status as a world-leader.

It is stupidly hard to get companies and banks to react appropriately when somebody is acting on my behalf though. I understand the UK Data Protection Act (DPA) as I worked in debit recovery for a while. I know they need consent but they're really bad at logging that information in a way that is immediately noticeable to the person taking the call. 

I'm sick of my ""helpers"" being challenged and refused service when calling with my prior approval just because of the failure to consider disabled people when companies are designing systems and business processes.

Still, so few companies have systems that allow the easy notification of an approved alternate speaker on the account or the option to record other disabilities in a way that is obvious to the company agent on the phone. 

They'll often note it as best they can, as my bank did, but it's not easily visible to those viewing the account details later.

To get past the DPA when they can't find the previous note they usually ask to speak to the account holder, just so that they can confirm you are happy for somebody else to speak on your behalf.

It's not really helpful when I can't hear a word they're saying while asking me security questions and just have to do my best to say ""yes"" or ""no"" as directed by the person helping me. The very person that will then take the call!

It's ridiculous how many major institutions, especially the people that deal with government based assistance or banking, just do not understand disabilities and how to work with them...even though it's often their job to do just that!

I do my best to try and get the service the law says I should but in reality nobody knows what to do when confronted with a disabled person.

It's extremely frustrating for me to get even the bare basic help from customer service. Anything important seems to be avoided because they don't know how to cope with my deafness on top of my inability to visit a store in person (physical disabilities.) 

If I explain that I can't call and I can't go to the store they seem to suddenly ignore me.

Section 10. [**Club coefficient**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_coefficient#Club_coefficient) of article  [**UEFA coefficient**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA%20coefficient): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The club coefficient rankings are determined by the results of clubs in the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League over the previous five seasons, as well as by the coefficient of the clubs' association. The club coefficient is the sum of the points earned by the club over the five seasons plus 20% of the club's association coefficient.  

&gt;The clubs receive two points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a defeat in games of the main stages of the Champions League and the Europa League. Results determined after extra-time are included in this method, however results determined after penalty shoot-outs are not (the result is considered a draw). Bonus points for entering the Europa League group stage are not additional to win/draw points; they provide a minimum points allowance for participating clubs, whereas bonus points for entering the Champions League group stage (and those for qualifying to the knockout stage) are additional to win/draw points.

&gt;Qualifying round results are only taken into account if the team is eliminated in one of the rounds (see table below). Otherwise, the qualifying round results are taken into account only for the calculation of the association's coefficient and are halved.  The clubs do not receive any points for elimination in the Champions League third qualifying round or the play-off because those teams move to the Europa League and receive points from participation in that competition.

I used to be a big supporter of his and argue against criticism against him but these last two months especially have been abysmal. He should not have been arguing with critics on twitter, he should have been taking their criticism on board. 

Skrtel has been exposed far too much by Johnson moving forward and not tracking back quick enough. IMO the big defensive problem we had this season was Johnson and the knock on effect he had on the centre of defence (lumping tonnes of pressure on them).

The thing is his performance against United at Anfield was one of the best single performance by any Liverpool player this season. That was an immense defensive display. He has the ability to defend and I think he should prioritise his defensive side over his attacking side, particularly when we are 3-0 up. I don't know if Johnson has that in him to retool as less of an attacking fullback.

I didnt watch a game for years.. i missed the 2005 final! but I thought it was cool that they had won.  around 2009 I started watching more.. and absolutely fell in love with a player named fernando torres.  I couldn't help but fall in love with the relationship he had with the kop and the mutual adoration.  I adopted liverpool as my team.

true,BestFriendWatermelon,null,null,"&gt;I believe from the bottom of my heart that she would be of better in a different family. 

Don't count on this. I briefly worked in a children's home for failed foster placements, and while of course there are the full spectrum of experiences from adoptive/foster families, a lot of the placements are very messy, stopgap solutions that leave the child with a lifetime of issues.

Transplanting families is not easy or pleasant. 

**Best case scenarios**

* At best, your daughter will be traumatised by being removed from her mother. It will take months for her to stop crying, asking to go home, sleepless nights, etc. 

* At best, your child will miss out on a lifetime of the most basic levels of intimacy and physical attachment a family should give. Her adoptive parents will likely feel awkward and disconnected whenever they hug/kiss your daughter.

* At best, your child will struggle to identify the adoptive parents as her parents, perhaps refusing to call them ""mum"" or ""dad"", preferring their first name or surname. This may well lead to rebelliousness, drug abuse, etc later in life.

* At best, the adoptive parents will love your daughter as much as they love their own kids, and their own kids will not be the kind of nasty little shits that 99% of kids are. Don't count on either of those things though.

**Worst case scenarios**

Those are the best case scenarios. I'll tell you about the worst case scenario kids I worked with:

* violent gang members. Often with criminal records, involvement in drugs, stabbings and sometimes shootings.

* paedophile victims. Some exhibited signs of becoming predatory themselves, with a canny ability to lie, manipulate and get inside people's minds. Ever seen in the news, stories of predatory paedophile rings? They go after foster children for a reason; the lack of identity and lack of belonging to their family makes them easier to lure into abuse. If most children's mothers told them not to talk to strangers, they'd obey without question. If a foster parent said it, that's just another person's opinion in the eyes of a troubled teenager.

NB: at the risk of heartily offending some men reading this (I am a man myself, and I cannot overstate that not every man is like this), sexual abuse by adoptive/foster parents is not uncommon, especially among fathers. Even more common is the kind of borderline abusive behaviour such as staring at their adopted daughter too long, staring at her chest or bottom. Barging into her bedroom without knocking (he knows what he's doing), inappropriate hugging, that sort of thing. This kind of fluff can be psychologically scarring too.

* a black girl who identified as white because her foster parents were. Despite being able to see herself in the mirror and the colour of her body, she was deeply racist against black people, almost as if trying to compensate. This was most apparent when her biological father attempted to get involved in her life again as a teenager, and she would spew racist insults at him.

I'm not really telling you all this to scare you, just to give you a little perspective. 

**A little bit about Low Self Worth**

When someone I knew of committed suicide, she left behind a note wishing everyone the best, in particular her 18 year old son, who she asked to work hard at uni and do well in his studies to make her proud. She told her boyfriend to find someone new, and to be happy, etc.

She was delusional. Her son failed uni, got into drugs and alcohol, his life crash and burned because *his mother fucking killed herself*! What the fuck was she talking about, ""do well in your studies, son, make me proud"". It took her boyfriend 5 years to move on, and he *still* freaks the fuck out whenever anyone sounds slightly upset. All her friends were devastated, and have to live with the guilt of wondering what they could have done.

People like yourself imagine that their loved ones will be better off without them because they lack a sense of self worth. You don't think your daughter will miss you despite the fact that you'll miss her. She will miss you ten times as much. Your depression is keeping you from seeing either how much you're worth or how much you'll regret giving her away. 

But depression is a common problem that affects 1 in 4 people, and needs treating, just like any other medical concern.

**Actual self worth**

You are a brilliant, intelligent, capable human being, who is going through a normal reaction to a broken relationship. The split with your husband is a bereavement, and hurts as much as if he died. You need to grieve properly, and get support for it, not give up on yourself and your child.

You're a good person. Good enough to worry whether you'll make your child as happy as another family would. The simple fact you worry about that means you're a better parent than many. But don't roll the dice that her new mother won't treat your child like personal property, screaming at her all the time and blaming her for things her other kids did wrong. That her father won't be a skirt lifting pervert. That her new siblings won't tease and punch and kick and bully your child every day.",0,1400547355,null,0,1400547679,0,chm8e11,t3_25w5j5,t1_chm8e11,t3_25w5j5,null,1433870268,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Given the fact cars are becoming more connected (bluetooth, internet, etc.) it's only going to become easier until car manufacturer's improve the security on their systems.

That's not the media repeating anything, that is the media trying (and succeeding by the looks of it) to paint Farage as an unsavoury character who you should not vote for. It's a smear campaign, and as per usual, every media outlet is doing it's best to jump on the anti-Farage bandwagon. The man might be a prick but he has every right to be heard and not brandished with ""isms"" using bits and pieces which, for the most part have clearly been taken out of context or have been misunderstood. 

Really the only thing I have seen any media outlet do with Farage is ask him awkward questions then brandish him with names, even when the names don't really suit what was said. You are sitting here saying he is a racist, I don't think he is. He has said multiple times that he would prefer if non-Europeans had the same opportunities as Europeans when it came to immigration and the likes, yet nobody seems to be reporting that. As someone with family outside of Europe, I find our current system of ""Europeans only"" to be extremely racist, you can't call Farage a racist for wanting to reconsider immigration when you are happy to agree with the current policy that separates families and makes life very difficult for someone with family outside Europe. 

Why do you think it is acceptable to allow Europeans into the UK with no question but someone from Asia has to go through expensive and confusing visa procedures, only to be refused multiple times before being able to get even a tourist visa.

Son is such an attacking talent, better than both Lallana, Kono and Shaqiri IMO even though he plays a different position (striker/second striker compared to winger). He could slot into our first team very well while from what I've heard of Can being just a squad player I can't see why you'd prefer Can over Son.

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"""...in order to hit the target of a &lt;2C rise in temperature.""

Humanity clearly isn't going to hit that target. It would require a sacrifice in lifestyle that 99% of the population will simply not accept. You can agree or disagree with me saying that, hate me or grudgingly accept it, but it's true. The last I looked into it a good number of climate scientists were saying that 2015 was pretty much the realistic cut off to achieve a sub-2C increase, and that if we didn't make it we shouldn't abandon the goal of a sub-4C increase, which I agree with.

That said, there are definitely ways of improving things. Coal is basically enemy number 1 in terms of CO2 levels. Incidentally it's also very bad for humans as it kills lots of us, but mainly the CO2 levels. Now we don't currently have a perfect way of improving on this, but we do have options.

In the very long term we have nuclear fusion and renewable sources of energy. 

In the medium term we have nuclear fission which can basically take care of global energy needs with small boosts from renewable energy. 

In the short term we can either leave things as they are and accept huge and rising levels of coal usage or we can take action to reduce that. One of the things we can do is make natural gas much cheaper than coal, as the emissions from natural gas are half that of coal. This is what has happened in America, where in spite of some methane leaks, emission levels have dropped significantly since the American shale boom, as coal usage has fallen through the floor. Other options include reductions in energy usage (although globally these are not feasible), gradual increase in the use of renewables where affordable, and improvements in power plant efficiency (again, hard to really manage given the developing world, although some efforts can be made in the developed world).

&gt;Ask Everton fans and they will tell you how often Lukaku goes missing. I love the guy but he isn't in a position to start big games - he's too young. 

I haven't said we should make Lukaku first choice, but bringing Mandzukic in would hamper his chances. The ideal situation would be to bring in Costa and have Lukaku has 2nd choice. Costa has been one of the best strikers in La Liga for 2 years. Only reason you think he's had one good season is because of the season Atletico are having. Both Arsenal and Liverpool wanted to sign him last summer before he decided to stay at Atletico. He is quicker than Mandzukic. We need pace in our team.

&gt; Mandzukic has got the perfect work rate for Chelsea, he's strong and big in the air. Not bad with the ball at his feet and he can shoot. Plus it looks like we can get him cheap because he wants out of Muenchen.

Costa has the same work-rate. Besides, we don't need a striker who tracks back to cover full-backs and tackle them. We need a striker who can stay up top and hold the line, and score a goal when given the chance. Costa's finishing is way better than Mandzukic's. I don't care if Mandzukic is cheaper. We have to sign the player that we need for this team. We've already seen how our better our attack is with pace when Eto'o plays as opposed to Torres who is more of a hard-working, tracking back type of striker.

Costa has been injured for less than about a month lol. Only reason he's kept getting a recurrence is because he hadn't fully recovered initially. Stop playing dumb about it.

And it's not even up for debate. And he scored an OG against Newcastle. If you look at the defence for the other top four, how many of their defenders are as error prone as Skrtel is? He's 30 this year. He's not getting any better. If we can bring in a defender to compliment Sakho we definitely should.

**Jackson Martinez:**

Height - 185m

Weight - 76kg

I wouldn't be surprised if all you've watched of him are a couple youtube compilations. You're fangirling hard.

&gt;Also, Costa not only comes with a lot of baggage, but he has an injury right before the summer, only had one great season and still has a lot of question marks on his ability to be able to replicate that form in the PL.
Jackson is a consistent goal scorer and has been a top striker for a while, he also is as healthy as they can be. If we need a striker I would wait out to see what Costa does in the WC, but I think Jackson is a great choice unless Costa has a amazing WC.

1. What baggage are you referring to exactly? Please elaborate.
2. He's had 1 injury problem with his hamstring and that has only been for about a month for the simple reason that he keeps getting rushed back.
3. He's had more than 1 great season.

&gt;still has a lot of question marks on his ability to be able to replicate that form in the PL.

.4. Same can be said about Martinez or any other striker playing outside the EPL. Futile argument.

.5. Costa is also a consistent goal scorer, and has more goals in all competitions than Martinez this season in a better league and also in the Champions League. 

.6. Costa has already had a better season than Martinez. I don't need to wait till the WC to see how good he is. But I know you do simply because I know that you feel that you haven't watched enough of him. If I had to guess, I'd say the only real times you've watched him was vs us in the CL.

I HIGHLY doubt it. Far as I know the qualification that's wanted by a lot of places is an ITEC one, whereas this one is from the ""International Council for Online Education Standards"", which tbh sounds not exactly very good. 

Maybe it's just me, but it sounds like one of those ""qualifications"" that aren't worth the paper they're printed on, I mean I could link a bunch of youtube videos and and give you ""the ehhno certificate of professional makeup artistry"" at the end!

From the company website:


**At the end of the course you will receive a certificate confirming course completion. The Certificate is issued by Trendimi. It states the course taken and the grade received. It can be used as proof of study for employment.**

**In order to be eligible for your certificate you need to successfully complete course and pass each course module (55% mark or more).**

They recommend 50 hours study for the makeup course. That's what like 6 full days? Most professional MUA courses seem to be months long.

One of the FAQs is ""Can I apply for a MAC Pro card?"" and the answer given is yes, just send a copy of your certificate and ID, which threw me, but it neglects to mention that according to the Pro application form, you need **2** proof things, certificate is grand but they also want a business card or editorial with your name on it etc etc, so this website is basically lying to people.

Stop being absurd. If someone lives in Pakistan for 40 years and then comes to Britain, they don't just lose their entire past life and upbringing.

The fact that homophobia and anti-semitism are common in the muslim world is a relevant fact because we have people coming HERE from THERE.

[Even the Guardian found that **British muslims** hold extremely conservative views on homosexuality. 100% of the 500 British muslims polled thought that homosexuality is unacceptable. 97% think that sex outside of marriage is immoral.](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/07/muslims-britain-france-germany-homosexuality)

Bear in mind that the Guardian go out of their way to apologize for Islam, so the fact that they're admitting it proves that it's not something I'm making up.

The fact that we have significant cultures in Britain, in which even the second and third generation immigrants hold homophobic views, IS important, and it is relevant to us for obvious reasons.

You've gone from saying ""it's a minority that hold those views"" (which is simply false), to now saying ""well this particular mosque doesn't hold those views""...

The point I'm making is that muslims in the UK are a far bigger threat to our ideas of women's rights, gay rights, sexual liberty, abortion etc than a lunatic group like Britain First that almost no-one agrees with.

Being bulkier also doesn't mean that you are stronger. Look up hypertrophy. Martinez's muscles are a prime example of how muscles look when you do hypertrophy. You get big puffy muscles. Antonio Valencia is another example. Costa's muscles aren't that big, i.e. smaller, denser muscles, which only goes to show that he is stronger, since he weighs more and looks almost the same size as Martinez. Also, if you watch Martinez even in this compilation, you can see in some of the goals (especially at 1:06 and the last one), how much he has to lean into a center-back when trying to take him on. And that CB isn't even that big.

Also, Ba is almost as strong as Drogba. What he lacks is balance and has a lack of knowledge about how to use his body to battle CBs, which is totally separate issue. If you saw Makelele, he was a small, not that heavy, defensive-mid. Smaller than Lampard and Tiago, yet he knew how to use his body. So strictly speaking, strength isn't even as much of a determining factor as you are making it out to be. Its about using your frame and you can see how well Costa uses his frame when he takes on CB. Watch any of his vids.

But anyway, Costa plays in a better league, will cost cheaper, is younger and has scored more goals. So by just those things, its not even a difficult decision for me, personally. Besides, a lot of Martinez's goals are simple tap-ins from close range. If you compare him to Falcao, Falcao had 41 goals in 48 appearances.",0,1400557918,null,0,1400558377,0,chmd3ze,t3_25yrs7,t1_chmd3ze,t1_chmbrn6,null,1433872559,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

Was made by a guy named Chad Roark. Fantastic graphic artist. Had a screen-printing business in Denver and partnered with a guy named Ron Katz, who became the president of the DWFCA. Chad had made a whole series of Doctor pins - #1 through #7 and K-9 and cyberman head, daleks, etc.. various other logo stuff. Plus the T-shirts and longsleeve sweatshirts - every shade and size.. 

Oh, and they were totally unlicensed! 

(The only group that had somewhat sanctioned kit was the North American Doctor Who Appreciation Society - NADWAS)

The Beeb knew about the club, but not that it was producing so much swag.

I'd been working for Ron since 85 when I jumped over from working for Gary Berman at the Creation cons in Boston and as far south as Philadelphia. Was smooth sailing until 1986, the day that the 'Hands Across America' event happened. Was a WhoFest convention at the Boston Armory and Peter Davison was there. 

Lionheart caught wind and sent in some lawyers and a US Federal Marshall and walked down the dealers tables and pointed to the various items and went, 'This, this.. that, *all* of those.."" and gave the kids on the tables 15 minutes to clear the stock or the axe would fall hard. The guy running the club - Ron Katz - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSXRMF1yohg - nearly lost his shit. Thankfully, he'd been raking in the cash all that morning and had made the bulk of the sales that day so we cleared the tables, I collected the large bills from the volunteers and got it to him asap.. 

There were only one or two of Ron's conventions in Boston after that - even Creation started going elsewhere, as it became too much attention from Lionheart for the dealers. 

(The rumor - *and this was just a rumor* - was that it was Matthew Waterhouse that went back to England after the con with Mark Strickson - IIRC it was a Creation Con in '85 at the Hyatt (or maybe the Sheraton, it's been a long time and my memory's fuzzy) in Boston - and complained about not getting as much as the headliner, and it alerted Lionheart to how much $$ was being made so they sat hard on Boston after that..)

I'd worked for both Ron and Chad at the DWFCA cons and also Gary Berman and Adam Malin at the Creation Cons from 83 to 87. Was also a founder of a group called NETLA - the New England Time Lord Academy and I met my husband in early 1988 and that was it for the cons and me!

At some point I'll put up the better pictures I have of the Pan Opticon New Orleans in '85 and Davison in Philly that same year.. but I need to dig out the negatives and scan them.

Here's the swag that I have left. The two fan club badges used to be the color-changing kind, but the chemical has long since stopped working.

In the UK, £300,000 will buy you nice 4 bedroom house up north and a nice 2-bed terraced house down south. Lets start at that as general figure. Second you want a buffer of emergency funds. To prevent you having to come out of retirement, I'd set it at a conservative £100k. There's very little storm you couldn't helm with that money.Third, you want to cover living expenses. In general I don't think 6% return is unreasonable over the long term (2% to inflation, 4% to live for) but you really want a buffer big enough to ride out the bumps. £40k/year is enough to keep two mortgage free people comfortable, even down south, but it doesn't leave much room to play above your comfort. I'd say at £50k there's room to go away and enjoy yourself every year, our forego that and instead support some financially less capable in your family or whatever. To get the £75k return required that allows to add the inflation to the pot and withdraw the rest, you'd thus need £1,25m sitting in a pot.1,250,000 + 300,00 + 100,000 = 1,650,000.Of course you could be drawing your nest egg down, in which case the money required is less, but requires you to know how long you've got left to live. Our buy an annuity, at least, when you reach 67. The returns on those are significantly less.So, to retire in comfort down south, you need £1,65m. This scales back the further north you go. If you're going abroad, you might need less, depending on local prices.",0,1400567208,null,0,false,0,chmg2dh,t3_25xhbi,t1_chmg2dh,t3_25xhbi,null,1433873952,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

true,LordAnubis12,eng-sussex,Brighton,"**Conservatives** - Ranging from sensible/pragmatic centre right to a more evil harsh right wing. Currently shitting themselves over UKIP, have some sensible policies but often financially motivated in regards to policy (and often have links to personally profit from things, e.g fracking and as such there's a lot of people on various committees etc to give them softpower) - so generally not to be trusted too much. Enjoy targeting the poor and powerless rather than tackling things such as tax evasion, probably cos it's a lot easier. Often erode workers rights (e.g Tribunal payments, legal aid, etc)

**Labour** -  Used to be seen as the 'good' party, less evil than Tory (still are a bit) but now see above. Fairly disorganised, too scared to actually announce any polices (slowly changing, see minimum wage announcement) but best approached with caution due to still being fairly right wing for what should be a left wing party. 

**Lib Dem** - Good policies on the whole imo, but widely seen as traitors after the student finance thing. Not sure how much they've managed to stop tories from doing in gov't, so could have been a good thing they got in and softened the blow but mostly now people don't want to know.


**Green** - Everyone dislikes them because of 2 things - GM and Nuclear - as they're  precautionary on these. Not sure how true it is but apparently party members can directly vote on policy so if they gain more support/more members this is the party most likely to change. These 2 issues are also not really covered in other parties, but it seems to be a sticking point with Greens for whatever reason. Made a bit of a cock up in Brighton council, but not too bad imo. Good social policies, not all environmental, though does have environmental in mind (which frankly is sensible/necessary now, and not just a hippy thing). Not perfect but probably the best of the above.

**UKIP** - Successful Shit stirrers. Short sighted, knee jerk reaction to policy, no real policies beyond EU/Immigrants, slowly being revealed members are more than 'just a few bad apples' and very much on the far right. However do publicity very well and are basically saying what Daily Mail readers are thinking who don't apply critical analysis to their policies/words.

So I decided to lead with incessant ""I want to enable Porn"" just to shut that response up, and hence the hilarious consequences and the ability to document quite what a nightmare it is for adults to be permitted to see the unadulterated internet because of such default blocking.

If it's a parental control the parents should be in control, not the ISP. Default blocking is stupid, and making it really hard to switch on/off is worse.

But we only need an interim solution because a whole stack of old power stations are set to switch off in the next few years, and large-scale replacement was expected to have been planned decades ago. Useless short-term politicians failed to do anything about this, and now we desperately need something to keep the lights on *quick*. 

Gas power stations are relatively clean (yes, CO2, but far less harmful pollutants such as particulates) and can be built more rapidly than anything else. That's why fracking makes an excellent stopgap. But it won't last (fracking wells deplete extremely quickly), so this 'solution' is only any good if also backed by a massive wave of new baseload stations, ready to take over when our gas is depleting and climbing in price. Realistically, nuclear at best, more likely coal. We need to start on those right away as well, so they're ready for the end of the fracking gas boom. 

Our political system is so shit at long-term planning, I don't believe anybody has the courage to say 'build shitloads of longterm strategic baseload power, state owned if needs must'.  
So what's the point in fracking if we don't have a plan for the decade after that? It's just delaying the inevitable. 

Edit: it sounds like a massive contradiction, but I'm voting Green. I support renewable energy (including subsidies), but any engineer can confirm that current technology will never meet current demand spikes. It can contribute, but never be 100% dependable when required.  
Their anti-nuclear policy is misguided, but I'm willing to let that go.

However we aren't playing patiently or economically anymore. This season the system was clear; high-speed movement, superior numbers and lots of cutting inside. For that system Skrtel's practically a one man wall. He constantly clears and constantly defends with aggression, making opponent counter-attacks sloppy and in several cases dull.

Independence affects our long-term future - Salmond is just another politician. The Yes movement is *much* more than Salmond and the SNP, and the typical voter isn't really aware of this yet.

As for Westminster and the EU, Westminster have a vested interest in a No vote so I would take what they say with a pinch of salt. No EU state has said they would veto Scotland's membership, and the EU will only discuss the issue if they receive a formal request from the UK to do so - which hasn't happened. I agree there are a lot of unknowns, and the SNP should be more open about them, but when I weigh up the positives and the negatives, I am convinced a break from Westminster will be good for us in the long run. Nothing personal of course, purely political.

1. The F35B fleet will be a shared asset between the FAA and the RAF - if the F35C had being chosen all the pilots would need to be trained for carrier trap landing which would make less F35s available for deployment on the QE class.

2. F35Bs do have a shorter range but on the other hand the effective range advantage of the C version is not as great as you think -cat and trap planes need to keep fuel reserves for go arounds. The RN will also be using the ski ramp and a new landing technique to preserve increase the f35Bs payload and range abilities.

3. STOVL aircraft can maintain a much higher sortie rate.

4. There will be AEW in the form of Crowsnest radar on Merlin helicopters.

5. The capability of the QE/F35B whil not as good as the USNs Nimitz/Ford class CVNs will still shit over anything any of our peers or likely rivals will be able to put out. If we do fight a major conflict it will be as part of a US lead alliance where the QE will work with the USMC LHDs not as a strike carrier.

Your point was that some guy wrote a book and he said that people in Murdoch's position didn't meddle as much as they are thought to. All I did was list my reasons why in Murdoch's case specifically I think that reasoning doesn't apply.

&gt;As evinced by the press in our own country, left-wing papers tends to sell less well than right-wing ones. You could argue about why this is the case, but I don't think the fact of it is in dispute.

Do you have a source for this? I did a bit of googling but couldn't find a source I'd consider reliable (Much of what I came up with were third-party claims that went unsourced)

&gt; Television is more balanced, mostly because of Ofcom regulations, but if left to its own devices I'd wager we'd see the same swing on the box.

I could definitely argue the same, especially since Murdoch owns a few news stations in the US. All right-wing, of course.

&gt;As an aside, you've got this the wrong way round. Liberalism has historically referred to laissez-faire governments, what you've referred to as classical liberals.

Nevertheless he is certainly pandering to racists and/or xenophobes in order to achieve his goals, and frankly that is reprehensible. The ""you know what I mean"" thing, is especially underhanded as it will mean that he can appeal to these people, without directly saying so (he knows full well that people who hold racist and xenophobic views will assume he means what they already think and, you'll note, is in no rush to correct them) and yet, when accused of racism himself, he can claim he meant something completely different. Cue ""everyone is picking on poor old Nigel. Sad face."" 

I accept that calling him a cunt might be a bit childish, but I stand by the 70's part. The ""I wouldn't want one living next door to me"" thing is a vile and ignorant sentiment that should have gone away a long time ago.

LOTF: Chose from either 1) significance of clothes and mask or 2) two events that you choose. Not sure why I chose to do 1 as for 2) you get to choose what to write about yourself.

Anyway:

* Start of novel, school clothes, childhood innocence
* Cap at the start with symbol gives identity to boys
* Mask is a 'nameless authority' which 'liberated him from shame and self-consciousness' - no responsibility for actions.
* End of novel, contrast between Jack's 'remains of an extraordinary black cap' and the shining, bright clothes of the naval officer, shows weakness of uncivilised actions when rules are upheld, brightness is symbol of hope for the boys
* Uniform of naval officer is looked up to by Ralph, shows his respect for civilisation and democratic rule which he had been missing since Jack took over and became Chief
* Jack is a Chief, and he sits there 'garlanded, like an idol'. More than just respected, even worshipped, shows savagery is very powerful in an uncivilised world.

TKAM: Gobbet question was kind of easy, just about the Radley family. part b was a bit more difficult, about the Maycomb attitudes towards the Radley family. Skimmed through the book and managed to land on a good quote, which was nice.

* small town life - Miss Stephanie Crawford, gossip etc.

* Children are easily influenced - they are scared of Boo even though he's never done anything wrong and he's actually helped Scout with the blanket - rather than being thankful she is automatically scared. however, Miss Maudie has an opposite view and this shows that they can have separate views from the majority of society.

After the elections all the votes are placed according to the first preference votes, if someone has enough votes to get in *[(number of total votes divided by the number of seats+1)+1]* then that person is noted as getting a seat and their votes redistributed according to the second preference. If no one has enough votes to be elected then the person with the lowest amount of votes gets eliminated and their votes redistributed according to their second preference.

This process is repeated using third and fourth preferences if need be until all the seats are taken.

It has been generally advised to go down the ballot numbering the candidates in your preference for the number of seats plus 1 but this isn't always true. 
This style of voting means that if everyone actually votes properly the vote can't really be split by fielding too many candidates, and if you are a minority group you can't waste your vote by voting for a candidate unlikely to get in, as you still have your other preferences.

Whilst we may have dominated somewhat in the PL this season, let's not get too ahead of ourselves and state that we'll dominate in the hardest competition a side can be in. We've accomplished so much this season -- beyond even the most ardent supporter's wildest dreams -- but we've had our moments of madness and weakness. Norwich, Aston Villa, West Brom, Chelsea, are all signs that we have the capacity to improve in certain areas; the defence is key to improvement, obviously, but so is the need to change of our style when it needs to -- teams will come to Anfield in the CL and play like Chelsea did, and it's up to Rodgers and the team not to fight against that but to adapt with it, changing our game and still getting a result.

To be dominate on the European front, sometimes you just have to sacrifice your playing style in exchange for the result you need. As we're still growing and feeling our way into what we want to be under Rodgers, this will undoubtedly take some time, but it's an important part of the game.

When Minecraft first game out in an early alpha version, the game was pretty bare-bones. However, there was a promise from Mojang that they would develop it further, so people bought the game in their droves. Lot's of different people had lots of different hopes for what later versions of Minecraft would bring. Some wanted more RPG elements, some wanted more creative elements, some wanted more mining elements, and some wanted more crafting elements. Some of these peoples ideas would have been completely at odds with each other, but they both bought the game anyway, and filled in the blanks for the future with what they wanted. 

This is essentially how UKIP are getting support. They are the early alpha build of a political party. They have a core mechanic of leaving the EU, but very little else, so if someone likes the idea of leaving Europe, they fill in the blanks of their other policies with stuff they like. This means you can have two people with completely different political ideologies supporting UKIP, simply because UKIP have been so vague with their policies outside the EU.

For me, it's public transport: the same bus at the same time which follows the same route to the same workplace five days a week. At the weekends it gets really exciting and we can get a different bus to a different place, but I assume most of us would just stay local if not heading into town for something (see: alcohol).

The afternoon is weather-dependant when not at work. If it's sunny (which, despite the horror stories, it sometimes is) then we pretend we're in Spain and crack out the shorts and t-shirts, then go sunbathe on the nearest piece of grass or find a pub with outdoor seating. Essentially, if there is sun then you have to grab it with both hands and make the most of it.

Not sure whether you were meaning eating out or just eating in general, but Greggs is a staple of my diet. Steak bakes, sausage and bean melts, sausage rolls, etc. are all timeless classics. Also hamburger suppers from whatever chippy will let you in the door at 2am. As for food at home, tends to just be easy to make meals which can be cooked in bulk. Pasta mince, stovies, chicken sweetcorn and such - things which give you a good meal plus leftovers for taking to work and snacking on. *tl;dr: pastry.*

On workdays I eat before work, halfway through the day and almost as soon as I get home (something like 9:00, 14:00, 19:00 with a 10:00-18:00 workday). At the weekends I just eat whenever I want because I can. Lothian Buses can take my schedule, work can take my free time and the government can take my pennies - but they'll never take my freedom.

And FWIW, I work as a software test engineer on a twelve month academic placement (full time, salaried). I'm fairly convinced that the majority of folks living in the Lothians or outskirts of the city will commute towards the city centre.

true,remyworldpeace,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"Thank you. In short it is because of two reasons: I feel they have my interests at heart, and they have been successful with the economy.

When it comes to my interests, my parents are small business owners and I am just about to enter the workforce from university. Their lowering on taxes for small businesses and raising the personal tax threshold (fair, a Lib Dem policy) is directly benefiting me and my family. As is freezing council tax and scrapping the fuel duty escalator - these have truly helped me feel there is more money in my pocket. 

As for the economy, I think austerity was necessary to cut the massive amount of waste in government departments and to (slowly) bring down the deficit - I would have probably gone further. Compared to France where the public sector is still so bloated, the Conservatives have got this call right in my mind. I think they will be vindicated in the long term.

And now we are seeing a growing economy, record levels of industry confidence and falling unemployment (I have just been offered an industrial placement so this is also benefiting me). These are excellent things.

Finally, as for those who are worse off I guess I believe that work, rather than simply being handed out money, is the best way to improve peoples' lives.

I need to get back to work now but can answer challenges to the above later.

These are 4-7 years old, having a slightly older PC isn't the end of the world, because all schools will have computers in classrooms already, along with interactive whiteboards etc.  They wouldn't be losing their IT equipment, they just have to extend the existing kit from a 4 to a 5 year replacement cycle.

Investing that money in a kitchen to provide a hot nutritious meal has significant educational benefit. 

We know well fed kids learn better, we know hungry kids, or kids filled with unnutritious crap have poorer educational outcomes, there is research dating back decades to demonstrate this.

So investing part of the educational budget for one year to bring the kitchen back up to standard will pay off in the long term in improved educational standards.

I answered the question on chapter 1 for TWIB because we'd done a very similar question on the mock (which I got full marks for) so I pretty much knew how to answer it. My answer was based on elaborations of two primary points as to why chapter 1 is effective: we learn beforehand how the events of the plot have affected Arthur, which sets the reader up to be subverted when the true horror is revealed to only be indirectly due to the events at Eel Marsh House, and that Hill's initial florid descriptions serve to exploit the pathetic fallacy so later such descriptions of Eel Marsh have a greater emotional impact on the reader. I examined Kipps' references to the events in his past as well as the ghost stories for the former, and the metrical quality that a lot of the first page or so seems to have when Kipps describes the area around Monk's Piece.

I also mentioned the family business, how the disconnect between being introduced to the family he has with Esmé and that during the events of TWIB he frequently refers to Stella instead, and how that initially causes the reader to assume that there was an inconsistency. Of course, the last chapter irons that out.

As for OMAM, I think I nailed part a) by going into a lot of detail with the way George and Lennie spoke (I spent a good paragraph using Lennie's childlike, repetitive manner of speaking compared to George's scolding as evidence that George is like a father figure to Lennie, for example). I don't think I did as well for part b); I talked about the attitudes of certain characters such as Carlson (for whom it's really simple - just read the last sentence), Crooks and Whit to illustrate how the concept of friendship was alien in the times of the Great Depression, but I feel that I didn't go into enough detail about the contextual factors that caused all of this isolation in the first place.

I think I could get an A out of it, which would be good for me considering that I did almost zero revision for it. Personally, I feel so glad that I will never have to read or even think about TWIB again. I think I'll do much better on Thursday anyway. Less page flicking.

* Only issue bus lane fines for repeat offenders, seriously, £150 for a two second mistake?

I really don't think it was entirely Soldado's fault. Under AVB we were a stagnant and uncreative side which was starving Soldado of chances. Under Tim we played much more vertical which was much more suited to a player like Ade, throw into the mix Soldado's lack of confidence (along with the new city/country/language and wife's miscarriage) and Tim's mystifying decision not to play Soldado after he had finally scored and you have a recipe for a striker to struggle. 

Soldado still struggled and we need to acknowledge his part in his own struggles, but it wasn't all his creation.

I think Soldado can be a very important part of the squad next season if the new manager (regardless if that is Poch, FdB or someone else) can coax his confidence back. I look at how Ade came back from last season (and the 1st half of this season) and think the same type of turn around could be coaxed from Soldado with a new manager. 

He reminds me a great deal of VdV in his play on the pitch in that he always seems to be in the right spot and has that natural vision and creativity that we lack in the squad as a whole (was somewhat surprised that with all of his odd experimentation of players in different positions that Tim never really tried Soldado in a VdV-esque CAM slot behind Ade with any regularity) as well as his natural movement and on the pitch presence. He may be ageing but he has a natural level of ability and vision that we could certainly make use of under a new manager.

It will be tough for us to sell him and get any type of return on him so unless someone comes in and makes a very competitive offer (the rumour of Athleti being interested for £18m-£20m stands out) and barring Soldado wanting to return to Spain i just can't see Levy selling him.

I would like to think that Soldado comes back to life under a new manager but depending on circumstance i could see us having him on the bench until he proves he is otherwise suited to be the starter.

Can he be labelled a flop?...yes.

**IMPORTANT to bare in mind** - Whilst General Elections are elected through first-past the post (where whoever gets the most votes in a constituency wins, and everyone else loses), European Elections are elected through party-list proportional representation.  This means that each electoral region is assigned a number of seats, and these seats are allocated based on the vote percentage.  For example, the south-east England region has 10 seats, if 40% vote Labour, then Labour wins 4 seats, if 10% vote the Green Party then the Green Party gets 1 seat.  Therefore, you should not feel you have to vote a major party to get what you want in this election - even a small party has a chance of winning seats.

Another thing to bare in mind is that in the European parliament, in order to allow collaboration between parties across international borders, some parties align themselves to political alliances, so if you get the chance it is worth reading the manifestos for the European alliances as well (in brackets are the UK parties that are aligned with the alliance):

* [Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party](http://www.aldeparty.eu/en/events/european-elections-2014) (*Liberal Democrats, Alliance Party of Northern Ireland*)

Here are some data.

Source: 2013 Population Survey, country of birth (000s), numbers in prison by nationality (March 2013):

* UK: 54,484 72,285
* India: 729 465
* Poland: 646 862
* Pakistan: 465 466
* Ireland: 403 744
* Germany: 304 59
* Bangladesh: 234 229
* USA: 217 57
* South Africa: 209 84
* Nigeria: 180 545
* Jamaica: 145 783
* Kenya: 142 50
* France: 136 106
* Italy: 133 79
* Sri Lanka: 131 118
* Lithuania: 130 460
* Philippines: 124 18
* Zimbabwe: 113 170
* Australia: 110 10
* China: 106 152
* Romania: 101 671

So the total incaraceration rate (for England and Wales) is 0.13% for UK nationals (note that this will include people who are foreign born but have naturalized - I'm not sure if stats are published by country of birth). You can divide this (somewhat arbitrarily) then into very low crime (below half of this rate), average (half to double) and then high crime (more than double).

Very low crime: India, Germany, USA, South Africa, Kenya, Italy, Philippines, Australia

Average: Poland, Pakistan, Ireland, Bangladesh, France, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, China

Very High crime: Nigeria, Jamaica, Lithuania, Romania

Ranking the worst of the worst:

* Romanian 0.67%
* Jamaican 0.54%
* Lithuanian 0.35%
* Nigerian 0.30%

Jamaican criminals in British prisons is a well-reported phenomenon.

They are such a nuisance, we have have tried to send them to Jamaica: http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/British-anger-boils-over-Jamaicans-in-UK-prisons_16414343 It's been reported for over a decade: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/3097882.stm http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2662257.stm

Our links with Jamaica are long standing. We went there and built plantations which we filled with slaves. It is understandable we have many Jamaicans in the UK. They are not the 'first choice' of immigrant if you could choose, but we can hardly complain

What is not understandable is why we would choose to admit Romanians to the UK. As the stats show, they have the highest rate of criminality of citizens of any country in the world in the UK, worse even than the Jamaicans and Nigerians (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9468600/Well-never-send-the-Jamaican-and-Nigerian-prisoners-home.html) we have struggled to get rid of. Why the fuck would we, entirely voluntarily, choose to allow them to come here, no questions asked? It's bonkers. If you want open doors, why not open them to Australians, or Americans, or something? Why Romanians?

I don't think that this necessarily makes them cut and dried villains. If I remember correctly, the General knows what he's doing will cause deaths, but he also knows he's about to be forced into a major battle with the French, so it's a kind of damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.

* Free movement of people; allowing Brits to easily take job offers in Europe, holiday easier and enjoy the autobahn

* There are EU programmes which benefit students 
* European intergration (depending on your point of view)
* European space programme, and joint European projects.
* Trade bloc with the largest economy in the world.

**Cons**

* The EU itself is highly undemocratic, its elected MEPS cannot make legislation, they can only vote for/against legislation. Ok, the European commission who make the laws are chosen by our elected leaders, but I think this is too removed to be called democratic.
* The EU makes trade agreements on our behalf, which means some good but some bad trade agreements. Currently, Indian mangoes have a 10% tariff. In fact, Switzerland has more trade agreements than the EU itself!
* Little control on immigrants who come into Britain. This allows immigrants who are willing to work much less into Britain.
* Understanding the EU machine is very hard, it's too bureaucratic in it's current state.
* German dominated

Currently on the fence about the whole thing.

Anyway the main difference he pointed out was the flexibility. On the whole their two systems are largely similar but while AVB had very strict roles for the front three Poch allows the two wide forwards more of a free role. He also adapted the height of the back line, and at times the players in that back line to suit the opposition they were facing. AVB just stubbornly assumed his team would play the exact same way and hoped that it would work by shear force of will.

I think Poch would be a fantastic fit for our squad with some minor tweaks. We would need to hold onto Vertonghen and have options next to him that can fit a high line (Dawson would be very comfortable if the line wasn't too high, see my comment about Poch altering line height). Adebayor may or may not work, he played a similar role while at Real, he has also done it on occasion for spurs. Walker needs to be fit and develop an understanding with Lamela/Townsend like he used to have with Lennon. Rose needs to improve consistency or be replaced.

tl;dr Poch and AVB play largely similar, Poch seems more able or at least more willing to adapt and tailor the team to combat opponents. We have the squad for it but could do with a couple of tweaks.

There are some details of the 2013 budget [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/259692/EU_Finances_2013.pdf); the EU budget is around £110bn, of which the UK is supposed to contribute £17bn (£47m a day), but with the rebate (a special UK discount) contributes £14bn (£38m a day), and the UK public sector is expected to get paid back over £5bn through spending, putting the net public sector contribution at £8.6bn or £24m a day.

We disagree at the basis of the LBC interview. I am willing to give Farage the benefit of the doubt over the comments he made due to the nature of that interview. Other people might assume that these are his opinions,  judging on Farage's later comments, his previous interviews, and how he seemed flustered. I would conclude that those people are making a rash judgment that might be impaired by their views on UKIP and Farage.

You seem a bit confused on the last point. The statistics reveal that Romanians are disproportionately connected to criminal activity.

1. compare the rent on a property vs its value.  if the annual rental as a % of the price is high, then the property is cheap.  If you see people buying houses that they are renting out at &lt;4%, then that person is either an idiot or is relying on the property to grow in value in order to get anywhere (maybe both?). likewise, if the rent is &gt;7%, then the landlord is making out like a bandit, and the property is pretty good value.  you won't easily be able to track one property like this, but look at a block of flats near you today - i can bet you'll find near identical properties for sale/rent.  there will be difference of course, but it's a useful guide to what ""expensive"" really is. those numbers are just a simple guide that i've made up - it will depend on location and market conditions etc...

2. the best time to buy is when everyone is selling.  at the moment, i hear about people making sealed bids at open house mornings with 20 other people and think what a terrible way that is to get a good deal (unless you are the vendor!).  i can't promise you that it won't get worse, but just something to think about.

3. despite the above, you shouldn't get too hung up on timing the market. you won't get it spot on unless you're very lucky, and you could well wait a decade for the next house price crash (or it could happen next week).  by all means try to get the cheapest price when buying a home, but don't get preoccupied with it.",0,1400586952,null,0,false,0,chmjsdn,t3_25ybx0,t1_chmjsdn,t3_25ybx0,null,1433875772,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

We've been wandering through the EU handing out the cash and trying to develop for around about the past decade if not longer.  
Obviously this hasn't gone as smoothly as hoped due to the Euro crisis and the bailouts Ireland, Greece and Spain required (and Spain is one of the countries we've spent a lot of development money on).

But yea, that's the basic plan. We vacuum up countries that can demonstrate a positive attitude to human rights and democracy, we add them to our peoples and spend money to build their economy, then we can sell to that market.

Obviously there are some trade offs the UK is going to have to make to continue being part of the EU (as it wishes tighter integration), some of which we've already made (more open borders, common agricultural policy, etc), others we have not yet (joining the Euro).

I find it incredibly difficult to put into words my feelings. I watch the effects of Tory policy and it makes me want to cry.

I left school when the Thatcher government came to power and the feeling of alienation is the same now as then for me.

Policy after policy which this government under Cameron has inflicted on us seems to pander to the selfishness that underpins Conservative values.

The royal mail sell off was a classic case of this where the policy is presented as good for everyone. Of course we now know that the whole scheme was created to plant millions of pounds into the pockets of Tory friends....basically a legal robbery from the taxpayer to the pockets of city investors.

16 investors were given preferential allocation of shares, of those 16 companies , who were supposed to act as long term investors 12 sold up pretty much straight away as of course the royal mail was so under valued. oh and how was that value assessed , only by companies with direct links to some of the preferred investors. Some of the preferred investors had direct links to the Tory administration like Peter Davis of Lansdowne Partners who was Chancellor George Osborne’s best man at his wedding.Goldman Sachs who lets face it have a wonderful track record of honest probity were also advisers on the sale are partly owned by some of the investment companies given priority on the sale.
On top of all this the Tories let Vince Cable be the public face of this shafting of the pubic so that when the shit storm hits they don't take it full in the face.


This is not an isolated case , planning law , education, NHS you name it , every policy stinks if your prepared to investigate and take off the 'I'm ok jack' blinkers.

I agree with what you said about taxes on small business, raising personal tax threshold and generally mending the economy. Financially, the current government has been great for me.

I'm pleased that same sex marriage went through and the UK is one of the first countries to have full equal marriage for gay people.

I support Trident renewal and I'm glad that the government put their full backing behind this.

I support fracking and I'm glad we are going to try and make some quick money. I don't see any good reasons not to - and the government did attach some strings, and I hope they attach more (like requiring some profit to be spent on renewable energy)

I like the idea of free schools. Not sure if they've been particularly well implemented though.

I think the whole ISP porn filter thing was blown out of proportion. It's nowhere near as bad as people here made it out to be. It's certainly not censorship to make ISPs offer a free filtering service for people who want it. Bear in mind that Talktalk introduced this years ago and actually charged £9.99 for the filtering service to customers who wanted it. Now every ISP has to offer the service for free. Reading the comments here I could only assume many redditors were 16yr olds living with their parents and outraged that mum and dad might block pornhub.

For the NHS, I personally haven't seen any changes, so I'm not too bothered right now. As long as quality of care improves and the cost is under control, I don't mind public or private involvement. My local hospital just had one wing renovated and it looks lovely. No real complaints here.

As for welfare reform, I don't really know because it doesn't affect me at all. If I had to give an opinion, I'd say that I support some of the ideas in principle, but the implementation has been heavy handed and politically driven.

I'm not a big fan of people getting arrested for saying mean things on twitter. But at the same time, I'm not sure whether that's the fault of the current government, overzealous police, or what.

I'm not super happy with the immigration situation right now. It seems silly to me that anybody from the EU can come to the UK, but we are insanely selective for non-EU applicants. That's just an attempt to keep the total number for net immigration low so the public don't get pissed off. So overall, it feels like a system based on politics, and NOT what is actually best for the UK. I also do feel that we have some problems with immigrants not fitting in well, and forming 'ghettos' in some areas. But obviously, one has to tread carefully around this topic for fear of being called racist or xenophobic. I think the current government are relatively powerless to change most of this though.

Then whenever we hit the last couple of games of the season we started playing Ade and Harry Kane balls were being crossed (or were trying to be) left right and centre. Most of Soldado's goals were one and two touch finishes in the box -(source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBHnymaOBe4)  so why lob the ball up to him so he has to hold it up? Get the crosses in.

tldr; No we played him on his own, and starved him of crosses

Q2) I haven't really done my research on either of the two managers that seem to be front runners (Poch and FdB), so I can't really an informed answer. But i think from what I've seen from Poch's Southampton (who have played nice football all season) I don't see why not, and much the same for FdB's Ajax.

tldr; Yes (in my opinion)

Q3) No. Although its hard. He came with a lot of expectation (obviously with the price tag) and didn't really have a great few months (on and off the pitch). But looking at the goals scored, he's only 3 behind Adebayor. Alright most in the league were penalties, but they still need scored. At the end of the day for me a goal is a goal. Granted 5 are in the Europa league but he didn't really get many games after Timmy came in. Also his link up play is very good and has the same assists as Adebayor. 

tldr; In my opinion no but the price tag deserved more.

Q4) I'd like to see Soldado starting upfront with either Ade or Harry Kane (Ade before Harry). I think they could do great things as long as the balls are being put into the box. It always frustrates me to see Ade picking it up deep and on the wings, I'd rather have a winger run to the touchline and swing one in. I definately don't think that we should get rid of him, that would be a mistake i feel, likewise with Lamela (if he's still alive). We haven't seen the best of Soldado, and i can't help but feel he's just around the corner.

tldr; Ade and Soldado upfront, keep him he'll turn it on next season with a bit of support.

I've explained this on here before, that is how IPOs are normally performed.

You need someone that is willing to underwrite the share price.

The idea that something is undervalued, is tricky, because without a stable market, we don't know the market price for something.  As such pricing IPOs are always tricky.

The classic for me is Facebook, look at what happened during the first day of trading.  It sank below IPO price.  But look at how it's price is now.

It was both under valued, and very much over valued.

Sadly that is true of most policies or laws.  Some are just out right stupid (help to buy) others plain odd.  However some that we've seen are very good for everyone.  Raising personal allowance for instance.

The classic for me, is that VAT was raised, Labour lowered it.  How does lowering a tax on luxury items help?  Even the Germans mocked us for this one.  Sometimes just having a party that does the opposite of labour can be a good thing.  To me raising VAT is an obvious, easy way of fairly raising money, granted there are a few things which should be exempt (tampons are luxury goods!) but on the whole it's a very good policy.

Effectively, they would do whatever they can to let people who are in negative equity work their way through it.

The downside to this is there won't be much increase in housing stock, in London at least, demand is still very high, so unless we suffer a crash in employment, bigger than the one we say 5 years ago, then ultimately the demand for rent will be high.  More people would want to rent than buy if they thought house prices are going down.   This means all landlords will be fine and dandy as their new lower mortgage rates will be covered just fine.

I like their control of the economy. Turning the economy around was, and still is, a huge challenge. Austerity was, in my opinion, required. Maybe it went too far and delayed growth, who knows. The recent figures on unemployment and growth seem to suggest that they know what they're doing. They also aren't afraid to make tough decisions.

I also like the tax cuts, we are taxed out of every orifice over here, and Labour's solution seems to just be ""Let's tax the rich"" to fix the economy, ignoring the fact that rich people will always find ways to take money abroad. Look at France.

They've also raised the tax threshold, this is good for poorer people.

I also agree with putting the onus onto the private sector; letting people help themselves will work if regulated. People complain about the lack of housing, house-building (mainly from the private sector) is at a high point right now, they houses just aren't finished yet, these things take time.

I dislike borrowing money to spend on something that is consumed today, rather than invested in a future for tomorrow.

My personal feeling is we've an entire generation of entitled little shits.  Retire at 60 with a massive pension, which the next generation pay for, down-size your house for a massive tax free windfall, whilst opposing any new building in the village (despite having above replacement rate children).

Everything has to be spent now, today.

You look at some of the more left wing arguments, we've got a housing crisis, but not paying benefits to people to have a spare room is somehow a hanus crime.  Meanwhile, I was taxed quite heavily whilst not been able to afford to live without a house mate to share costs with.  I struggle to understand why that is suffering, when those who are having the burden passed onto them are not able to have such luxury to begin with.

We've greated this odd split in society, the older people who own property or who are entrenched in heavily subsidised rents, and the poorer people who've just entered the adult world.

My student loan, total, was about £9k.  That was bad enough.  When I was 18 it was already fairly clear, if you don't have a degree, you'll be worth shit.  Now that is even worse, a degree isn't even worth the paper half the time, no education has really happened.  But you've proved you are not in the bottom 50%.  My parents day, what was it, 3% had a degree?  My dad was never remotely discriminated against by not having one, I mean the vast, vast majority did not.

Now thanks to New Labour, if you don't go to university, you're immediately less desirable than the person sat next to you.  That's utter shit.

But you've got a bigger problem, how to pay for all those people getting degrees which probably won't yield any improvement to the economy?  Before you could pay for a few via general taxation, but now, you've got 50% that's not very fair?  So more and more of the burden will be shifted onto the young person.

That's not fair at all.

I don't agree with the vast majority of Conservative policies, mostly I find myself agreeing with the Greens, but their stance on economics strikes me as 'optimistic' and their stance on power generation is again, not realistic in my view.

At any rate you can't fault a footballer (especially a veteran like Cole) for wanting more of any one of the three. 

Sport careers are short, guys who love the game want to play for a long time - that and there's not exactly a pension for these guys. When the game ends, marketability goes down, and the dough stops rolling in (by and large, there are exceptions). There's security in a longer contract at 33, there's the benefit of having big paycheques roll in, and there's the benefit of regular football.

Still, he traded his Woolwich shirt for a Blue one and will always be held up as not only a great left back for the club but as a player who won more trophies with Chelsea than Arsenal did over the course of a decade. [It also speaks to how stingy Arsenal were when they let him go](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-397671/Chelsea-land-20m-Cole.html).

Where does Cole end up next? Somewhere else in the Premiership? Turkey and Russia spend big money on players, maybe he'll end up at Galatasary or Zenit. Maybe he signs an endorsement deal with Dubai or Abu Dhabi's tourism commission and ends up playing for Al Ahli or Al Ain. Or maybe he ends up playing with former teammate Thierry Henry in New York, or former countryman Jermain Defoe in Toronto. Or maybe he really likes the IFC series Portlandia and goes to play with the Portland Timbers.

Either way, whatever club gets him next will be lucky to have a fast paced left back who makes some incredibly clutch goal line saves and every once and a while [scores something sweet](http://youtu.be/2oCmFbaCL6k).

true,AidanSmeaton,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"&gt; the SNP have done a good job of making their supporters believe that Westminster is somehow their enemy

I'm not actually an SNP supporter. I used to vote Lib Dem, and now I lean toward Green. A big problem with Westminster is representation. Smaller parties (like the ones I support) are not fairly represented in Westminster, whereas they are in Holyrood. I want the smaller parties to have their fair say in national affairs currently reserved for Westminster.

&gt; blaming England for when things go wrong

That's the beauty of independence! Holyrood will be fully accountable and there will be nobody to blame but our own politicians.

&gt; We have our own devolved parliament

Holyrood has very limited powers. The general powers reserved for Westminster include control over the constitution, registration and funding of political parties, international development, regulation of international trade, home civil service, and defense. On top of that, there are specific reservations.

* Financial and economic matters (**policy**, currency, financial service and markets).
* Home affairs (**drug abuse**, data protection, elections, firearms, film classification, **immigration and nationality**, animal testing, **national security**, counter-terrorism, betting and lotteries, emergency powers, extradition).
* Trade and Industry (**business associations**, insolvency, competition, intellectual property, **import and export control**, customer protection, product standards, weights and measures, telecommunications, **postal services**, research councils).
* Energy (**electricity**, **oil** and gas, coal, nuclear power, energy efficiency).
* Transport (road, rail, marine, **air**).
* Social Security (pensions, child support).
* Regulation of Professions (architect, health, auditor).
* Employment (industrial relations, health and safety).
* Health and Medicines (abortion, xenotransplantation, embryology, surrogacy, human genetics, medicines, medical supplies, poisons, welfare foods).
* Media and Culture (broadcasting, public lending right).
* Miscellaneous (judicial salaries, equal opportunities, **weapons of mass destruction**, ordnance survey, time, space agency).

I would wager than Scotland would have a different approach to many (if not most) of the policies it currently has no control over. Holyrood has been a huge success, I think a transfer of powers would be hugely beneficial to the country.

&gt; the UK which is set to overtake France by GDP by 2016 and Germany by 2030

This is sort of meaningless. GDP **per capita** is what really matters, and Scotland is already outperforming most of the UK. I'm more interested in seeing us climb Quality of Life indexes which take account for health and happiness as well as wealth.

&gt; we certainly get a better deal than England in this union

How so? I agree that they should also have a devolved parliament, but until they do, Westminster *is* England's parliament. Their MPs outnumber ours, and their policies reflect England more than they reflect Scotland. This would be fine if Scottish politics aligned with English politics, but they don't.

&gt; I'm not prepared to walk away from this just because of petty nationalism.

This is not petty nationalism. It's not even remotely personal, it's purely political.

The downside of having the time off is that not everyone else has that time off but I find ways to keep myself occupied.

Regardless of whether or not it is true, disproportionate levels of crimes committed by Romanians is not the same as disproportionate numbers of Romanians who are criminals.

No it does matter.

If someone is paying more of their income on things which are non-essential, then so what if they are taxed more relatively.  The goal should be ensuring that things are taxed fairly, as I mentioned at first, tampons are taxed.

Then lets take those figures, 9.8% of income, on vattable products.  The tories raised that then by just under 0.25% of their income.  Their raised their tax liabilities by a quarter of a percent.  How much of that has been offset by personal allowance rise?

The richer person still pays more in real terms, and ultimately VAT is a very hard tax to evade.  I think that rising basic allowance, reducing the cost of administering such 'progressive' taxes, whilst rising VAT is a very good move.

Only if you were to say, ""they commit more crimes because of their race"" would you be racist.

Otherwise I would say it's fine to possibly be concerned, because the statistics speak for themselves, and the likelihood of them committing crime is higher than if another race were to move in. 

Obviously it depends on the situation though, if you lived in a middle class area it would be stupid to be concerned, as it is obviously to do with class and not race.

true,inawordno,eng-westmidlands,Brummie,"&gt;I dislike borrowing money to spend on something that is consumed today, rather than invested in a future for tomorrow.

Don't know much about economic principles [but have't they borrowed more?](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2013/11/the-tories-have-piled-on-more-debt-than-labour/)

&gt;My personal feeling is we've an entire generation of entitled little shits. Retire at 60 with a massive pension, which the next generation pay for, down-size your house for a massive tax free windfall, whilst opposing any new building in the village (despite having above replacement rate children).

&gt;You look at some of the more left wing arguments, we've got a housing crisis, but not paying benefits to people to have a spare room is somehow a hanus crime.

There's a lot of arguments from both sides that make sense. It is a complicated situation which maybe would not have occurred if not for the housing crisis.

&gt;Meanwhile, I was taxed quite heavily whilst not been able to afford to live without a house mate to share costs with. 

I'm curious what cost you more money; taxes or rent? I lived with my brother for almost a year in a flat. The rent and taxing crippled us. But renting is a bit ridiculous at the moment. I am more inclined to blame the insane renting prices that taxes in general. The only thing stopping me buying a property and mortgaging it is a huge deposit. Which I know is maybe needed but there's barely a difference between monthly rent costs and mortgages (if I remember correctly) and I never see the rent money again. It goes to some well off person with a few properties.

&gt;I struggle to understand why that is suffering, when those who are having the burden passed onto them are not able to have such luxury to begin with.

I just feel this is a rhetoric being pushed at the moment. Instead of looking at where the country's money is being moved to and why that means we are struggling to live. We are looking at people with less than us and being angry they are getting anything at all. 

&gt;We've greated this odd split in society, the older people who own property or who are entrenched in heavily subsidised rents, and the poorer people who've just entered the adult world.

Are you arguing that the conservatives are even the least bit interested in poor people? If they couldn't vote, they wouldn't want to help them.

&gt;Now thanks to New Labour, if you don't go to university, you're immediately less desirable than the person sat next to you. That's utter shit.

Not in my opinion. I want a well educated society. 

&gt;But you've got a bigger problem, how to pay for all those people getting degrees which probably won't yield any improvement to the economy? Before you could pay for a few via general taxation, but now, you've got 50% that's not very fair? So more and more of the burden will be shifted onto the young person.

Bit of a tired and overused of a reply maybe but why not fix the tax system. I'm tired of seeing an article pointing out unpaid taxes of billions to company then everyone complaining about benefit frauds. 

&gt;I don't agree with the vast majority of Conservative policies, mostly I find myself agreeing with the Greens, but their stance on economics strikes me as 'optimistic' and their stance on power generation is again, not realistic in my view.

Admittedly I care more maybe about social issues. Mainly I care more about quality of life. I don't need a bigger economy. I don't need a new McDonalds. I need more free time. I want to enjoy my life. Not spend that majority of it asleep or at work. It runs me down and sort of makes me feel this isn't worth it.

&gt;But compared to the damage that Labour have done. It's an easy choice. I can't help but feel that we don't want the wrong kind of lizard.

Nevertheless, Prime Minister David Cameron made it clear in July 2013 that his aim was to ensure that by the end of 2013 all ISPs would have a filtering system in place.""

""Some smaller ISPs expressed their reluctance to take part in filtering, citing concerns over costs and civil liberties but the government stated: ""We expect the smaller ISPs to follow the lead being set by the larger providers"". Cameron said ISPs should choose their own preferred technical solution, but would be monitored to ensure filtering was done correctly.""

""Although these arrangements are voluntary, legislation to enforce them has not been ruled out. In fact, Cameron announced such legislation in July 2013.""

As prime minister and leader of the coalition, Cameron is ultimately responsible for pushing this. Obama didn't write most of the paperwork for Obamacare, but it is still called Obamacare. It is also not voluntary.

It isn't even remotely similar if you ask me. Sakho had to play the majority of his matches away from Anfield, against harder opponents. Agger played the majority of his matches at Anfield against far lesser opponents. Not really surprising that the matches Sakho featured in resulted in more goals against over the course of a season.

That's simply not feasible, infrastructure limits the number of trains you can run at peak times and even at times of very little demand a certain minimum service has to be maintained. Pricing based on demand and offering incentives to use less popular services is absolutely standard across countless industries across the world and it does work.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt;Don't know much about economic principles but have't they borrowed more?[1]

The trend, is your friend.  The debt has increased, because Labour handed over a Deficit.  The Deficit has started trending down, they say 2018 we will stop having to borrow more than we spend.  &lt;sarcastic voice&gt; Woopie.

Once the deficit has been fixed, then we can pay down debt.  The issue is, that we allow spending beyond what can be afforded.  See how we pay defined benefit pensions (rather than defined contribution) to many state employees.

&gt;I'm curious what cost you more money; taxes or rent?

IIRC (this was a couple of years back), my share of rent was about £800, my monthly tax about £750 including share of council tax.  But yeah, I'll rant about the whole ""ooh look how much my house has gone up"" mantra.  Fucks me off that no political party sees this as a massively big problem.

&gt;We are looking at people with less than us and being angry they are getting anything at all.

Not when there is a shortage of the underlying commodity.  Why is someone house sharing, paying tax, driving up rental prices (supply n demand n all that), funding someone to have a spare room.  We've this bizarre idea that those on state assistance shouldn't have to house share, whilst those funding it.... fuck those guys!

&gt;Not in my opinion. I want a well educated society.

Interview them.  It's created a class divide, few before considered that the well educated were exclusively those who went to university.  What about those who aren't academically minded?  It's too splitting.

&gt;Bit of a tired and overused of a reply maybe but why not fix the tax system. I'm tired of seeing an article pointing out unpaid taxes of billions to company then everyone complaining about benefit frauds.

Because it's hard.  Oh god I hate people who say ""I've done the hard part, I've sold our design of car, oh it has to fly as well as get 1000 miles per gallon, but yeah I've done the hard bit"".

It's impossible to fix without restricting trade to countries heavily.  My classic example is I run a coffee shop.  I have the paper cups printed from a Hong Kong or Singapore company (paying very little tax!).  Each cup has my logo on it.  So I decide they are worth £1.50 of the £2.00 coffee I sell.  Is that tax evasion?  How can you ever realistically manage that?

Meanwhile you've got an actual cost.  Economics you've got opportunity costs and real costs.  Having tax rules that allow you to receive more are an opportunity cost.  Real costs are what bankrupt you pdq.

So yes, figure out a simple, fair way of taxing these complex entities and get my vote!  You might want to start on something easy like a millennium problem first, have a warm up n all that.

&gt; Not spend that majority of it asleep or at work. It runs me down and sort of makes me feel this isn't worth it.

Some would argue that a more efficient economy is the only way to achieve that, and that free market growth is the best way of achieving efficiency.  I'm not completely signed up that way, but on the whole, it does it a shed load better than a government!

Primary schools are getting into encouraging their pupils to see learning as something that's part of life and not just something that happens at school, and OFSTED are evaluating their success at this.

Get up some time between 8 and 10, make sandwiches for myself and the girlfriend, maybe have breakfast (cereal and milk usually, but sometimes toast)

Then 30 minute walk or 10 minute bus to the office defending on my mood and the weather (all 4 busses that go past my flat also go past my office).

Occasionally I'll join the rest of the office for lunch and go to one of the many nearby sandwich shops, or the various Thai, Indian or noodle bars around the office. Usually I just make my own lunch to save money though now. Lunch is eaten sometime between 12 and 2, depending on when people in the office are hungry, and any meetings or talks that are on. It's usually a ""working lunch"" at our desks, but sometimes in a communal area, and we usualy take the time to socialise rather than work when eating in the office anyway.

Home time depends on the girlfriend, after work commitments, and how work is going, but I'm usually home by 6, and usually walk home.

We then make dinner together from fresh groceries bought at the weekend from the nearby Sainsbury's supermarket. Evenings are spent with a mix of watching TV, reading reddit, reading a book, making plans for the week/weekend, playing some games or doing some more work. I also play trumpet with the university wind band one night a week, and do archery some evenings.

Weekends are usually a day trip somewhere, or having friends over, or catching up on sleep. Sometimes we'll bake or make more time involved meals. The week's shopping is usually done on Saturday or Sunday. Sometimes during the week  or weekend we'll go out to a pub with friends or somewhere for dinner, or society event.

There are a lot of nice places to spend the day, such as the Royal Botanic Garderns, Edinburgh Zoo, picnic on Arthur's Seat, Butterfly World, not to mention it's not that long a drive to go out for the day somewhere like St Andrews, or the train through to Glasgow.

No it doesn't, it sounds horrific, peak users require more infrastructure than off peak users. They need more trains (which are idle at other times) Bigger stations, more train lines all of which cost money and principally benefit peak time users. Why should someone using none of those services pay to subsidies them for you?

To go back to my Thurs plans, if the prices were the same I would be travelling at 8.30, I'd be another body on an already packed train and I would be contributing to rush hour further. But because there is a price difference I'm travelling at 11 on a train that will be pretty empty, so to me it sounds like their plan is working.

O: And what about the line about not wanting to live next door to Romanians (he says it like 'Rumanians'), it's perfectly acceptable for people not to want-

F: I didn't say that. I was asked if a group of Romanian men moved in next door to you would you be concerned.

O: And what if a group of German children did? What's the difference?

F: Well, the difference, and you know what the difference is.

Then Farage starts talking about poverty in Romania, and how people from Roma communities find it difficult to find jobs, and how they have to turn to crime, and 'what happens with an open door, is that it's been an open invitation for the traffickers, and we all know this is going on'

Basically, his answer (in a round about and very politician like way) to why he would be concerned about Romanians living next door to him is because an open door immigration policy attracts people traffickers. For one, it isn't really an answer to the question at all, and for two, I doubt a Romanian person in poverty, and therefore more likely to commit crime, could afford to move in next to him. It's removing the nuance from an issue to say 'I'd rather have a German neighbour than a Romanian one'.

&gt; The other parties also have problems with Racists yet they don't seem to get the same attention that UKIP get, it's not a level playing field.

true,inawordno,eng-westmidlands,Brummie,"&gt;The trend, is your friend. The debt has increased, because Labour handed over a Deficit. The Deficit has started trending down, they say 2018 we will stop having to borrow more than we spend. &lt;sarcastic voice&gt; Woopie. Once the deficit has been fixed, then we can pay down debt. The issue is, that we allow spending beyond what can be afforded. See how we pay defined benefit pensions (rather than defined contribution) to many state employees.

I don't think it is enough to just look at the deficit. Maybe you study economics and I will embarrass myself here, but government debt is not like personal debt. [Interesting article.](http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/7568/debt/government-debt-under-labour-1997-2010/) 

&gt;Not when there is a shortage of the underlying commodity. Why is someone house sharing, paying tax, driving up rental prices (supply n demand n all that), funding someone to have a spare room. We've this bizarre idea that those on state assistance shouldn't have to house share, whilst those funding it.... fuck those guys!

I advocate house sharing. As long as the implementation is correct.

&gt;Because it's hard. Oh god I hate people who say ""I've done the hard part, I've sold our design of car, oh it has to fly as well as get 1000 miles per gallon, but yeah I've done the hard bit"".

Well, alright, that's not what I'm saying.

&gt;It's impossible to fix without restricting trade to countries heavily. My classic example is I run a coffee shop. I have the paper cups printed from a Hong Kong or Singapore company (paying very little tax!). Each cup has my logo on it. So I decide they are worth £1.50 of the £2.00 coffee I sell. Is that tax evasion? How can you ever realistically manage that?

&gt;Meanwhile you've got an actual cost. Economics you've got opportunity costs and real costs. Having tax rules that allow you to receive more are an opportunity cost. Real costs are what bankrupt you pdq.

Look I honestly don't know enough to argue with you. Some of what you said sounds like bullshit but what do I know. I know there's a problem that needs fixing. Everyone seems to acknowledge the problem - and for me it's a huge problem. I don't see enough being done to move in that direction.

Subs: Degenn, Riera, Poulsen, Xavier, Diao, Diouf, Kirkland

Edit: Just a bit of explanation. Spearing obviously gave his all, but was still crap, thus putting himself in the team ahead of Poulsen (who I don't think was that bad, just had a hard time finding anyone capable of replacing him on the bench). Jova and Voronin up top ensures we won't score, and with two of the worst right backs, the worst left back, and a relatively unknown left sided defender, we're sure to give Charles Itandje the nightmare he so truly deserves. Diomede only makes my team because I liked most of our left sided players, and he just couldn't do anything. That nearly overhead goal and maybe six other appearances for the club before another loan ensured he would fit into my worst 11. Nabil El-Zhar is similar, always trying, and besides two times, almost always failing to find the end product.

They definitely don't glorify goals and assists, they look at amount of actions, which doesn't necessarily represent how well they played, and is generally a lot less accurate for defensive players. Of course goals and assists are going to be a factor, but lets not pretend that they are the end of it. 

How do you think that stats can take into account the quality of passes/plays, the players that may have made an incredibly big play but got the second assist, or account for the fact that x player making ten times as many clearances as player Y simply because he plays in a much weaker team doesn't make him any better?

Not every number should just be taken for what it is, but try and interpret them and understand why their rating is what it is. I'm not saying that Gerrad had a better year than Toure, and they look at over 200 stats in their ratings here as well, but some things to explain it:

* Gerrard makes twice as many tackles per game

* Gerrard makes twice as many interceptions per game

* Gerrard is dribbled by only half the amount per game

* Gerrard has 3 times as many clearances per game

* Gerrard has blocked five times as many shots

* Gerrard makes twice as many key passes (shot assists) per game

* Gerrard loses the ball half as much as Toure

* Gerrard has made about 100 more long balls and also makes crosses

These are all approximates obviously, and of course there are other numbers in Toure's favour. Again I am not arguing that Gerrard was better, but you can see why he might get a higher rating based on data, no?

We spent thousands of pounds and spent months apart, living under the cloud of uncertainty of getting my application rejected- and that was under the old, more lenient system before Teresa May's rule changes in 2012, introducing the £18,600 a year or £62,000 in a bank account requirement, making it virtually impossible for a married couple who just finished university (as was the case with us, we would not have met the jncome requirement as my British wife hadn't made that amount over the last year, even though she was guaranteed to make it once she started the job she went to uni for) to live in the UK together.

true,TychoBraheNose,eu,London (UCL),"&gt;Legislation to make it mandatory has not yet passed. It is still voluntary, hence only about 3 providers have bothered.

Legislation has not passed because default filtering was opposed to by the Liberal Democrats, and so they won't try it unless they win the next GE with a majority. They probably won't have to, though, because of how they have played it - but that doesn't make it voluntary. The four major ISPs don't want to be seen as the odd one out for not offering the filters because their competitors will paint them as anti-child or something else ridiculous. If you put pressure in the right places you don't need to make laws. For example, in the US vaccines are not mandatory for children, however unvaccinated children are not allowed to attend public schools, and even private school in some states. 

By 'only about 3', what you actually mean is all four of the largest ISPs, with coverage expected to be at 95% by the end of 2014. You clearly don't know much about this, which is frustrating because I have had to write quite a lot about it. With all due respect, I won't be replying if you don't stop using numbers and ideas pulled out of your ass. 

Further, as I wrote in my last comment, smaller ISPs who are reluctant to enforce the filters are being threatened with the possibility of legislation to make them. That's about as voluntary as Nixon's resignation.  

&gt;It is still not ""his"" filter in the sense that government neither controls the filter or makes filtering decisions. That is up to ISPs.

The ISPs have very little say about what kind of content gets blocked, as Cory Doctorow stated in the Guardian in January: 

""last summer, David Cameron and the DCMS *mandated* that ISPs would *have to* switch on their customers' content filters (*to block everything from ""extremism"" to ""esoteric content""*) by default, and only deactivate them if the customer rang up and demanded it.""

Only Cameron and the relevant Tories know what 'extremist' and 'esoteric' content is. Whilst each ISP will have its own list of blocked websites, they don't have any say in what categories of content get blocked.

""Cameron said ISPs should choose their own preferred technical solution, but would be monitored to ensure filtering was done correctly.""

This is also all missing the biggest points, however, the filters are nothing more than pandering to worried parents, and have no reasoning behind them. There has never been a large-scale filtering of the Internet that made any significant difference to the wide-spread access to blocked content, no attempts have ever even come close. The language Cameron uses about the filters is so vacuous and overly emotional, for instance,

""But when it comes to internet pornography, parents have been left too much on their own. And I’m determined to put that right... no more hassle of downloading filters for every device, just one click protection. One click to protect your whole home and to keep your children safe.""

Protect your home? Keep your children safe? We're talking about porn filters (and extremism, et al.) that a child could literally circumnavigate. This is Cameron and the Tories pushing their morals and values on everyone, without any transparency with what they are doing or what they are blocking.",0,1400595333,null,0,false,0,chmmj1z,t3_25zkbh,t1_chmmj1z,t1_chmlbou,null,1433877078,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I honestly think the only solution at this point is the government to start buying vast swaths of property, and appointing (similar to TFL &amp; bus routes) companies to manage/let/maintain those properties, and rent is paid directly back to the government.

Providing a decent minimum of quality and size property in London at an actual affordable rate (£600pcm/single bed area) would quell the insane surge in rental prices currently happening.

""...the overblocking of legitimate content, and many vulnerable groups are severely disadvantaged. Websites to do with sexual health, sex addiction, child protection services, drug advice, and suicide prevention have all been blocked in the short time the filters have been implemented for (Smith, 2013). The people who require the services of these websites will, on average, be less Internet knowledgeable – either due to age or socioeconomic situation – and be far less likely to ask friends or family for help compared to, say, demographics wherein porn is socially acceptable and friends may freely share knowledge on how to bypass the filters between themselves, given the sensitive nature of the topics. As the New Statesman described the problem of overblocking, “the most vulnerable people in society are the most likely to be cut off from the help they need” (Robbins, 2013).""



They also don't just block porn, and the government are still refusing to offer any transparency on quite what they are blocking and on what grounds, as mentioned by Laurie Penny in the Guardian:

""The category of ""obscene content"", for instance, which is blocked even on the lowest setting of BT's filtering system, covers ""sites with information about illegal manipulation of electronic devices [and] distribution of software"" – in other words, filesharing and music downloads, debate over which has been going on in parliament for years. It looks as if that debate has just been bypassed entirely, by way of scare stories about five-year-olds and fisting videos.

I think I know what you mean actually. I had a born again Christian ex (who thinking about it visited this church once or twice, although - I hope - would never have been this hateful).

Could she *ever* admit to doing any wrong? Noooo. Jesus forgave her for everything, no matter how selfish, nasty, spiteful, petty or horrible it was. She did not feel an ounce of guilt for anything, just bounced right along not changing anything about herself because she didn't have to. Jesus loved her. I didn't know whether to be amazed or horrified. Slightly scary was that her born again friends were all mostly the same. Naturally they generated drama by the bucketload...

the problem with 1 mill is its not enough to retire on, so i'd do a ~ 1/3 split. 40% of it would go into pensions/investments. directly i'd get about 5% on 200k which is only 10k/year but its a decent base income to start from and the other 200k as a straight lump sum pension investment and is designed so i cant touch it till retirement. I'd also change my private pension retirement age to 55, young as possible because now i'd be sure of having a decent regular income from it. 


The next 1/3 is my family fund of 300k. this would be a 3 way split, so mum would get 100k, dad 100k, sister 100k. For parents it'll let them top up retirement/move house somewhere nicer and then have the rest to do whatever with. All 3 would move house I suspect, but i'm not sure where my mum would go. Maybe a nicer bit of doncaster.


The final 1/3 is my spending fund, although i'm not sure i'd spend all of it . This would be a combined travel and shinies budget. I'd immediately apply to take a 6 month sabbatical at work, though it'd probably take 3 months before i could start it so that gives me some planning time. Then i'd make a list of places I want to visit and find some nice luxury options for doing so (not top end, but decent quality establishments etc). 


Then i'd need to splash about 10k on some decent camera bodies and lenses, maybe more. also Laser eye surgery so I could appreciate my travel places. We'd need at least a few safaris, there's a ten day guided red panda tour of nepal that i'd quite like to do, as well as visiting canada, spending quite a bit of time in Yellowstone, Iceland, Scandanavia for a start.


I'd also be needing a serious car upgrade. Nothing too fancy, but maybe a nice high end audi designed for all weathers and terrains so I could spend a month or two slowly driving around europe and visiting many places. There would be an insane amount of photos, i'd need some sort of magical auto-upload them to home thing. You can get mobile wifi and cards that will write directly, so i could probably set something up to send them all to a remote server while i travel.



oh and i'd need someone to accompany me on my travels. That'd be the hard part.

&gt;__Zoroastrianism__ /ˌzɒroʊˈæstriənɪzəm/, also called __Zarathustraism__, __Mazdaism__ and __Magianism__, is an ancient [Iranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran) [religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion) and a [religious philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_religion). It was once the [state religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion) of the [Achaemenid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire), [Parthian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire), and [Sasanian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire) empires. Estimates of the current number of Zoroastrians worldwide vary between 145,000 and 2.6 million. 

&gt;Zoroastrianism arose in the eastern region of the ancient [Persian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire), when the religious philosopher [Zoroaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroaster) simplified the [pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon_(gods\)) of early Iranian gods  into [two opposing forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualistic_cosmology): Spenta Mainyu (Progressive mentality) and [Angra Mainyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angra_Mainyu) ([Destructive Mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil)) under [Ahura Mazda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda) ([Illuminating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_light) [Wisdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom)) in the 7th century BCE.

&gt;Zoroaster's ideas led to a formal religion bearing his name by about the 6th century BCE and have influenced other later religions including [Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism), [Gnosticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism), [Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity) and [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam).

Scottish domiciled students from poorer backgrounds will not only have no fees (no Scottish domiciled students have fees), but will also be able to receive a means-tested bursary (which is not paid back) in addition to the means-tested student loans.

My wife for example is English but is Scottish domiciled because she has lived here for a number of years.

If she was to go and study at Imperial or Oxford then not only would she have zero fees despite being English, she would get a full student loan as well.

I believe young students in Scotland from the poorest backgrounds will get a bursary of £2,575 on top of having their fees paid for them and the maximum available student loan.

Regardless of domicile and background, all students will be on the new style student loans which are linked to inflation and accrue interest at several percentage points above inflation, which is not such a good deal overall but still not bad considering the repayment threshold.

Gerrard shouldn't be considered a DM in my opinion, I think his role is different and not as solid as that of a traditional DM. Not to say he is a bad player, far from it.

Our system relies on the full backs proving all of the width. They will get caught out of position at times. When in possession we need to be more disciplined, DM needs to be prepared and able to drop back quickly and only one FB should go forward. 

The way we scored 100+ goals this season was by playing kamikazi football. It is attractive, but how many years of life span have you lost watching Liverpool this past season?

Except I do care and it does effect me, if rush hour users pay less then I will pay more, something I don't think is fair. I can just as easily turn this argument around for you. You don't care about off peak prices rises because they don't effect you! Why are you making everything about you! (See, its not a very good argument)

&gt;The nation will have increased control over any nationalised service vs. a completely privatised one - that's a no brainer.

So? Doesn't mean they will introduce flat rate ticket prices? As I've just said both BR and East Coast Rail (public owned) use(d) peak/off peak pricing. Why would you think a wholly nationalised rail service would do any differently?

&gt;I can see this is a struggle - but try and consider the majority of people are not benefiting from this. I know you've said several times that you don't care - but that shouldn't mean you can't get it at least.

The majority of people don't benefit from a lot of things, doesn't mean they aren't fair. Decisions are not made on personal benefit they are made on benefit to the system as a whole. Its ironic that you keep accusing me of having too narrow a view and not caring about others when you are doing **exactly** the same thing.

This is different from pretty much every other party where the 'executive' sits down and decides on policy as they know best. Obviously though, the problem with letting the floodgates open is that you get possibly more extreme policy positions compared to a managed policy, but the advantage is you get policies that reflect what people actually want.

I believe that sentiment is true for most Conservatives. It's that deteminded self-interest at all costs attitude that I'm most at odds with personally. 

Despite platitudes like Camerons's declaration that 'we're all in this together', I believe that his party is one of narrow minded vested interests. Essentially 'looking out for number one'. 

After all it was Thatcher who declared that there is no such thing as society. 

I Know very little about you yourself, I base none of this upon assumptions about your character. 

It's just that I view the politics of the left to be more in tune with my instincts of solidarity with those in hardship, the disadvantaged and underpriviledged. 

I feel like the Conservatives would have us believe that those who are vunerable are solely responsible for both their circumstances and for the remedy to them. That they deserve our derision, not our understanding. That they require sanctions as 'encouragement' to try harder, rather than a helping hand to get back up when they fall through the safety net. 

In fact I feel like Conservatives are offended by the very existance of a saftey net. Like it's an incentive to under achieve.

Nevertheless you should always be very wary of doing so without questioning its entire meaning and purpose (paying careful attention to what is being left out as much as what is left in).

Secondly, UKIP does not address the public's concerns, it creates them. It stirs up peoples irrational fear of foreigners and immigrants, by presenting exaggerated figures that confirm their prejudices.  To address the public's concerns on immigration, would be to explain to them that they are ignoring the real issues in favour of blaming foreigners for all the country's problems. Addressing and pandering are not the same.

In your example, UKIP are not the kindly, reasonable government, letting everyone know the details but emphasising that the foreigners are not criminals on the whole and shouldn't be judged based on the actions of the few. They are the hysterical citizens crying out for everyone of British heritage to be deported or imprisoned. They are the ones trying to hide the facts in order to push an agenda.

The run-up to Blair's first term, you had the history of so many years of Tory rule, and they were literally in the news smugly defending themselves saying ""the British public will vote for us no matter what"". Lots of starchy, ""politiciany"" canned answers everywhere you looked. But Blair at the time came over in interviews as very plain-speaking. ""Look, this is what I think we ought to do"" and so on, and he won in a landslide. Public support for him as a personality was huge. After his first term, his style was unrecognisable; the era of spin was well established and everything he said came across as evasive or overly-rehearsed. But you look back at those early years before he got elected and the change in style is noticeable.

Flash forward to the last election and Clegg-mania. You have a bunch of mainstream politicians giving the same spin-heavy rhetoric, and this guy jumps up from nowhere and again, talks to people ""on the level"", addressing them by name and generally coming across as a relateable human being among political automatons. Didn't translate to a real election win, but did a lot better than anyone predicted. Like Blair, he's ruined it since, of course. 

Today you have Farage and as much as I hate everything he stands for politically, you can see that a lot of the traction is down to the fact that people find him different to the current mainstream politicians. To my mind, he acknowledges that fact and tries to explicitly sell it as a virtue way too much to be convincing - it ought to be something you let people remark on rather than crowing about it, but I get why some people are taken in by it, especially if they're not analysing the truth of his politics.

I guess what I'm saying is whether people are taken in by it or not, just being able to be percieved as having a personality that differentiates you from the Westminster machine seems to have worked out for people in the last 20 years.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"&gt; Finally, as for those who are worse off I guess I believe that work, rather than simply being handed out money, is the best way to improve peoples' lives.

I'd love to work. Work is a wonderful thing, it gives you a sense of pride and purpose, it gives you confidence and drive which gives you a stronger work ethic and generally makes you feel happier. It improves your life in many ways, not just financially. But I'm not in work. I've applied for well over 200 separate positions since I graduated from university in July (BEng Mechanical Engineering, 2:1 Honours). I have two years of experience from working on the Formula Student team at my university, which I did in my own time to gain some of the skills vital within industry. I've worked hard to get where I am now but have nothing to show for it.

I've had 15 interviews, some of which were final stage interviews, but no success yet (All of which have been related to my degree. I can't even get an interview at Mcdonalds for christ sake). I've been on a number of free training and development courses (Including some interview training to try and see if/where I was going wrong - which I wasn't) and I am currently enquiring to around 20-30 companies in the area about unpaid work experience because i'm getting desperate. I am not an isolated case.

*Some* (not all) Tory supporters think i'm the worst kind of scrounger, that i'm taking your well earned tax money and leeching off the system. I should get off my arse and work instead of being given a handout. Or maybe i'm just less fortunate, and I need that handout to actually remain alive in the hope that one day I can actually contribute to the economy, once the recovery and the 'trickle down' effect catches up...

I just want you to know that it's much easier said than done. No matter what the government does in terms of tax cuts, subsidies or other incentives to encourage business growth and reduce unemployment, it isn't going to be enough. The bottom line is that a surplus in the labour market is good for business because it pushes wages down. This means that there is always going to be people like me who are out of work due to no fault of their own. These handouts are always going to be necessary to pick up the slack, and people can't be expected to work for free. Yet the Tory Party leading the coalition government is taking steps to reduce these handouts in an effort to 'make work pay'. They want to make lives worse for people in my situation, as if it wasn't bad enough already.

This is why I will not be voting Conservative, and never will as long as they continue to push such Draconian policies.",0,1400598657,null,0,1400598878,0,chmnz8a,t3_260qjg,t1_chmnz8a,t1_chmj2ee,null,1433877748,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23

There were no other BBQ options at all - I love me some ribs but nope! Had to have pulled pork or nothing. Not even a burger or sausage sandwich. All served out of a motorway junction style food hut. There was a jerk barbecue but we waited in line for another half hour, then sat at the front for another 15 minutes before deciding to cut our losses and grab some food on the way home. It's a real shame because there was practically no competition food wise, as it was pulled pork or jerk chicken and that was it, and queue's were horrendous.
