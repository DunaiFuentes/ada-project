true,Quagers,null,null,"*Disclaimer, I recently applied for a job as a management consultant at McKinsey (MPhys degree since you asked, most of the applicants I met had numerate degrees, lots of maths/physics/engineering)

Management consultants do add value or they simply wouldn't exist. While they may not have specific knowledge within your sector (although many go on to specialise within a specific industry) Their real value comes from seeing a lot of businesses and what works and what doesn't, they can take ideas which have been successful in one industry and apply them to others. Also their data analysis skills are something a lot of businesses do not have in house and allow them to identify trends and issues within a business. Often a fresh pair of eyes from outside the industry can come up with new novel ideas. 

Finally the simple true is that many people in businesses, even in very senior positions, suck at management and organisation and desperately need help.

Unfortunately resentment from the internal staff of a business comes with the territory for consultants. They are viewed as overpaid, arrogant know it alls who just point out the obvious. I think a lot of the time this stems from jealously and fear, the changes consultants suggest can cost jobs or at the least make the internal staff look stupid. But the simple truth is that if the business didn't have problems, they wouldn't have been called in in the first place

I was obviously terrified, especially because half the players seemed not to give a shite about the kids and would just sign stuff barely acknowledging your existence - John Oster especially that. Mikael Madar was really nice. I don't remember much else.

Anyway, I was terrified about going up to Big Dunc because he was my childhood hero. I think I left him to last out of the whole team, and when I finally got the courage I was shitting myself and just thrust my little autograph book in his direction.

The point of this story is this: First thing he did was ask my name. I told him, so he wrote a huge, personalized message in my book. He asks if I'm excited for the game, I tell him yes and that it's actually my birthday. He goes to a waitress, who comes back with a ball, and then he passes it round the room getting everyone to sign it for me. He then signs the back of my shirt (without me asking) and calls my whole family over to get a group photo together. No one asked him to do any of this. It was just Dunc being Dunc.

He might be the scariest player I've ever seen but he's also the best bloke I've ever met in my life, I've still got that photo and I'll try and get it uploaded if anyone is interested.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"&gt;I'm 26 years old and have ~£22k in raw savings. It'll be years before I can afford a house because buggered if I'm going to buy a flat - if it's going to cost the earth, I'd at least like an upgrade.

Yeah, that's not how this works. 

You buy a piece of shit place first because it's cheap and it will let you build up equity. 

Lets say you put down a 10% deposit and get a £220K flat in, I'm guessing, London. 

You should be able to get 3.99% mortgage fixed for a few years. That's what I'm doing. 

So now you're paying out £665 a month on servicing the debt and anything else you put in over that is money in your pocket in 2 years when you decide to sell. 

What's the average one bed flat rental in London nowadays? It's gotta be over £1100 for somewhere that isn't a shithole. 

So strait away that's £435 per month you save by buying the place you don't want to buy. Plus, I imagine you're saving money each month if you're amassed £22K in savings. 

Lets say you're also managing to save ~£400 a month (I'm guessing you've been saving since graduation at about that rate).. 

So now you're putting away ~£835 per month into your mortgage. In 2 years your equity will have gone from £22K to £42K. Now you're in the position to upgrade.. 

I'm not even taking into account a rise in value of your flat in that time. I'd hazard a guess you'd be looking at another £10-20K conservative estimate. 

That's £62K deposit on a £300K house or nicer flat. That'll get you a 80% LTV and a much cheaper mortgage rate.

I've said this a few times but I will continue to say it. I 100% prefer Pepe to Mignolet purely because SM is a good shot stopper and that's about it. When the ball in near mignolet, I panic, whenever he plays a long ball up field, it will either go out or we lose possession unlike pepe who set up nando torres LOADS of times from goal kicks. Mignolet has no authority, control or discipline over our defense like Renia did. Even against arsenal I thought Jones showed more presence then  Mignolet has shown the last 5 games.         

I'm not saying this to disagree or be an asshole as I know everyone here loves the guy, I mean yes I went crazy when he saved that pen against Stoke but that was MONTHS ago and hasn't done anything since.

&gt;The **Russian Blue** is a [cat breed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_breeds) that has a silver-blue coat. They are very intelligent and playful, but tend to be shy around strangers. They develop close bonds with their human companions and are sought out as pets due to their personalities and coat. Some Russian Blues have a small puff of fur above both of their eyes that slant slightly down to give the appearance that Russian Blues look grouchy.

I don't buy that at all. What I think you haven't considered is the concept that management and co-ordination are skills-based ideas, and that they are aspects which are arguably going to be the most foreign to people who have worked as technicians in their respective industries. The simplest way to demonstrate this is the idea of experience in management. The reason that one would expect a experienced manager to be more effective than a novice is because of a developed skill set. If this exists, then these skills can be analysed, and optimised, but within an organisation this is difficult to implement, except through rather simplistic ""performance reviews"".

He could side with Russia, and be demonized by the western media, or side with the european union, and no matter which one he sides with, violence was almost bound to eventually erupt. Protests started out peacefully and were an attempt to show their support for a deal with the EU trade routes. But soon the ""Fascist"" radicals came in (Most of which are football hooligans by the way) and started provoking and starting riots. Obviously the government is going to have to attempt to stop the violence, and unfortunately there have been a number of deaths on each side. personally, all i wish is for the violence to end.

- Council with no clue constantly wasting money  
- Drive into the city is called ""The Golden Mile"" because it supposedly has the biggest gold trade in Europe, but the cruel irony is that it's the tattiest and most horrible street you could think of. Also, no exaggeration here, EVERYONE who lives in the area is an African or Asian immigrant, it's literally impossible to spot a native. (EDIT: Not being racist, it just makes the city very segregated and causes a lot of racial tensions)
- City is filled with run down 80s-90s buildings, half of which are empty  
- Giant, modern and flashy eyesore of a shopping centre in the middle that looks incredibly out of place and has sucked the life out of the city. 
- Lots of very rough estates, places the police will refuse to go to at night because of the danger  

And thats just the city itself. The county itself is basically the north/south divide present in the UK compressed into a county. Half the towns are run down and working class places that used to have factories or mines that are long gone, the other half are relatively wealthy countryside places with farms and such.

Excelsior excels at selling comics, they can tell you what good and what's not.
They also sell collected card games (CCGs) like, magic and board games.
While they're experienced at selling comic, alas this doesn't follow through with CCGs and Board Games. 


[Aera 51](http://area51online.co.uk), 230 Gloucester Road, Horfield Tel: 0117 9244655.

Aera 51 excels at selling board games and CCGs with a huge horde of individual cards for sale.  They also comic and graphic novels but you're better off, buying them from Excelsior which is both cheeper more knowledgeable with what comics are good.


Both Excelsior and Area 51 have board game and CCG nights:

* Excelsior's are Tuesday nights for both board games and CCGs, with occasional tournaments at the week ends.

* Area 51 has Board games on a Monday, Magic on a Thursday, Yu-gi-oh on every other Saturday and periodic Magic/Yu-gi-oh pre-releases and tournaments.
Area 51 has been known to be more elitist than Excelsior when it comes to magic tournaments.
They also have a huge stock of board games to play on monday night, with many people choosing to leave there copy there to be played as well as a number of shop copies.

Long story short, Buy comics from Excelsior and your board games and individual magic cards from Area 51.",0,1392861011,null,0,1392861516,0,cfjrfmi,t3_1y6poe,t1_cfjrfmi,t3_1y6poe,null,1432474184,3,false,bristol,t5_2r52c,3

In the UK any market share over 25% is termed to be a monopoly.  In economic theory they could be said to form part of an oligopoly. 

Where there's only a few providers, or only one provider the end result for consumers is very similar. With a pure monopoly they have no reason to reduce price, with an oligopoly common sense tells them that if they reduce price the competition will be forced to do so, so nobody does it.

Mastercard/Visa is a very unhealthy situation, and I'd like that sorted.

I know it might not be what you want to hear, but if we set the tax system/minimum wage/etc so that it was easier for people in your position to buy a house then house prices would just quickly correct upwards.

If the government somehow got rid of the interest rate premium for low deposits, and supported your deposit - allowing you access to the most competitive rates as a first time buyer, and meaning you didn't need a massive deposit... again house prices would immediately shoot straight up.

The issue is entirely around supply and demand. Just like the article says the young lose. The older people hold all the cards. And the massive wealth they accumulate in their houses is only supported when they give money to their children to buy other houses, again that props up house prices.

The government need to close the gap between the demand for new houses each year and the supply of houses each year. I've said before that a correction downwards is a bad thing. But house prices can fall relative to wages without falling in real terms, that would solve all the problems over time.

I feel very sorry for London commuters, you get shafted every which way. I'm lucky in that where I live house prices are low, but I earn a London wage (certainly not a high one!), that puts me in a relatively comfortable position. People don't seem to realise that to have a reasonable house in London that's a half hour commute from the city is simply impossible unless you have a very considerable income.

One final thing : you will likely find that rent is far more expensive than mortgage interest, which is what you need to compare in order to choose. If you are able to buy somewhere now that you can tolerate, then you should make a considerable saving compared to renting, and you will be better placed when you can afford a house to get a mortgage.

We still have a lot of issues within our defence - we've had DM's out, we've had Enrique and Johnson out, Agger out - these, in some ways, have provided clear chances on goal which led to us conceding.

Let's look at quite a few of the GK's:

**Szczesny**:

* 26 appearances
* 12 clean sheets
* Avg. goals conceded (1.00)
* Avg. saves per game (2.27)
* Avg. saves per goal (2.27)
* Avg. claim success (95%)
* Avg. punches success (50%)
* Distribution success (70%)

**Begovic**:

* 6 clean sheets
* Avg. goals conceded (1.24)
* Avg. saves per game (2.33)
* Avg. saves per goal (1.88)
* Avg. claim success (94%)
* Avg. punches success (52%)
* Distribution success (70%)

**Reina - Liverpool 12/13**:

* 31 appearances
* 14 clean sheets
* Avg. goals conceded (1.10)
* Avg. saves per game (1.35)
* Avg. saves per goal (1.27)
* Avg. claim success (89%)

And lucky last, our man:

**Mignolet**:

And still not impressed regardless of what Mourinho says about him.

Honestly there are a lot of amazing young winger out there, and quite  a few I would rate above Salah. I mainly think that the whole reason we got him was 1, so we could have more supporters, specifically from Egypt and other Arab countries. And 2, because he is left footed. If he was a right footed Bosnian I dont think his skills would ever match Chelsea standards.

Players I would have rather bought over him. Greizman, Lazar Marković (we tried to get him, he chose Benfica instead :(   , Lucas Ocampos, James Rodriguez (One of the best young midfielders in the world, left footed and makes Salah look like an amateur in comparison. Highly unlikely we can pry him off Monaco hands for a long time) ,  Viktor Fischer from Ajax, very young winger for Denmark but very skillful, whenever I see him play he always has that spark, highly rated in the Erevdise. I would have also gotten Bruma instead, i think Mourinho would have as well, he actively pursued him in the summer but he chose to go to Galatssry, nearly the same pace as Salah but much more skillful of a dribbler and a better finisher I think. 

Those are just players I would have gotten instead of Salah, but honestly with the amount of talent we have whether on loan or off the bench I think we should have had more trust in the youth. How are players like Piazon get a nod on now that they have to compete with Schurrle, Salah, Oscar, Hazard, Willian to get a place? And all but Willian is very young. I would not have bought Salah at all, would rather have recalled Moses from Liverpool, since he isn't doing shit over there anyways, kept him as depth until the end of the season. Sold him in the summer and then brought back Piazon.

The Stoke one (again, I have to guess, but I think you're talking about the third) was actually poor shot-stopping. The Cardiff goal you could argue he should have come for the cross, but that's a little harsh, and it wasn't caused by him coming off his line or doing anything rash. The City goal was poor - and he certainly should have come off his line quicker - but in the end the problem was poor concentration and an odd strike by Negredo.

TBH it doesn't really work like that - there are hundreds and hundreds of NHS dentists across the country. You just have to call them, ask if they are accepting new patients, and if they say yes ask to register with them. That's it.

&gt; There are these adult upgrading courses called access to education that are free, they last a year full-time

You would need to speak to individual course providers to find out if you're eligible for your fees to be waived. This is usually the case if you're under 24 and don't have a previous level 3 qualification (in the UK this would be A levels or equivalent). If you're over 24, regardless of what educational qualifications you have, you have to take out a loan called a 24+ Loan which is provided by the UK government. You can find out eligibility here: http://www.24plusmicrosite.com/eligibility-tool (I went through it and it has questions about living in the UK for the past 3 years...basically if you're gonna turn 24 by the time you come over, you're going to want to talk to these guys first. And you'll need an address to give them, so sleeping rough isn't going to be an option when  you apply.)

Are you also aware that Access courses require you to have GCSE or equivalent maths and English as of Sept 2014? And that most require you to attend an interview and maths/literacy tests?

This is why the 'housing crisis' in London is overstated. Too many young snobs who think they must buy their ideal home in Zones 1 and 2 only, because the idea of having an hour-long commute is just too much to bare. 

Despite being ""young professionals"" they're obviously too thick to understand how the housing market works. I bought in Zone 4, my house price has doubled in value in 6 years because I bought a place in an unfashionable neighbourhood which needed fixing up. 

This means I am now in a position to buy a place closer to central London or a significantly bigger property in Zone 3 or 4, because I've built up equity, and instead of paying rent, I've been paying off a mortgage - a mortgage which is half the rate of renting a similar property in London.

Every time I hear someone say ""I own £40k a year and have a £25k deposit and can't afford to buy in London..."" I just want to punch them. What they really mean is, ""I can't afford to buy in the highly fashionable neighbourhood I think I deserve to live in.""

true,jbubermensch,US,usa,"&gt; Viktor Fischer from Ajax, very young winger for Denmark but very skillful, whenever I see him play he always has that spark, highly rated in the Erevdise. 

I've never seen any of the players you listed play, but whenever I see a high rated attacking skill player that comes from the Eredivisie, I'm always skeptical as the level of defending there is about 6 steps below that of the EPL. That said, there are certainly a fair share of world class players that have come from Ajax, so I'm not going to dismiss Fischer having never watched him.

&gt;How are players like Piazon get a nod on now that they have to compete with Schurrle, Salah, Oscar, Hazard, Willian to get a place?

If they have the requisite skill to succeed at Chelsea, our loan players will knock these players out of their spots. When they come back you can be sure Mourinho will decide who plays and/or stays based on the merit they show training, not based on their price tag or any other factor. He demonstrated that pretty clearly with Mata.

Personally I think it's far too early to judge whether Salah was a good signing so I disagree with the post overall. Like I said I haven't seen any of the other prospects you mentioned so I can't dispute your assessment of them. But I think trusting Mourinho would be wise as he's got access to far more and better resources for judging player ability than anyone here, for both players on loan and prospects for new signings. If he believed our loan players were a better resource he would have recalled them, but clearly something convinced him that signing Salah was a better option and I'm not going to call it a mistake until Salah's had some time to bed in.",0,1392879505,null,0,false,0,cfjz0lf,t3_1yehdt,t1_cfjz0lf,t1_cfjtc8w,null,1432477824,3,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,3

Putting that extra man (Silva) in midfield showed a willingness to have more bodies there to try to keep possession, pressure them in the middle and force them wide, where Kolarov and Navas would help in defending. It also showed that Pellegrini didn't want to play a completely defensive team. If he did he would have played Garcia along with Fernandinho and Toure.

One thing I noticed was that barca looked terrified of us at corners. We had the size advantage, just not enough corners. We didn't win an expected amount of aerial duels though, probably due to the defense pumping the ball upfield.

The players did the best they could though, and we can't fault them for effort. I felt Yaya was slightly off his usual self that day though, seemed as though he was trying to be nice to barca.

The Tenth Doctor's first regeneration (i.e. the eleventh) was used up in the process, but it was used up without him getting a new body. As a result, the number of incarnations is now one lower than it ordinarily would be. He siphoned off the remaining energy of it after his body had healed. He did *not* receive a new, identical body. He remains the eleventh incarnation, including the War Doctor. The Eleventh Doctor, though he was the result of the twelfth regeneration, is also the twelfth incarnation, and the Twelfth Doctor is the thirteenth.

The metacrisis duplicate is a near-copy of the Tenth Doctor, created with the regeneration energy that *would have but didn't* go into creating a new body for the Doctor, plus the interaction of Donna's hand to begin the process.

Simply put, the body the Doctor had after that regeneration is not a new copy, but exactly the same body he had before it. The energy never had the chance to change his appearance. Even if regeneration did make identical bodies (which it doesn't), if it had changed his body into an identical copy, then there would have been no energy left to create his duplicate. It doesn't double up. The Doctor's explanation of this makes it very clear.

We were broken into 3 times in six months, including one time when the intruder broke into my female room mates room, stood over her bed and was approaching her until she screamed the house down. We had multiple windows broken, were threatened with knives on separate occasions, had our door kicked in several times, watched several people get their shit kicked in and had to intervene in an attempted rape. Kept up almost every night from ignorant cunts shouting in the street, drunkenly chanting paramilitary anthems. Oh, and our car was pretty much destroyed by the end - and got broken into too.

We didn't have parties (fairly quiet mix of Chinese, Polish and Northern Irish postgrads) we caused no trouble - we just happened to be living in a main thoroughfare, so were fair game for the first years... apparently. 

The only people who defend the Holylands are either those who don't live in it, take part in the shitty behaviour, or try and turn a blind eye to them because some of their mates take part in the shitty behaviour. The place is only 'Fun' if you're an arrogant, ignorant culchie who likes breaking shit and ruining your neighbours lives.

It happens. It's frightening and the place is a ghetto because of it. I defy anyone to stand on the corner of the Fitzroy and Jerusalem/Carmel/Palestine for an evening and justify the students' behaviour as they head home after a night's drinking.

That's the problem. The students think they can get away with anything, because they usually can. That doesn't mean that they should. The cunts. Queen's have a large role to play in this, as does the UU, but they wipe their hands of the place every chance they get.

TBH he already showing us his ability for the last three season in Atletico, both in domestic and european stage. Heck even in Super Cup against us.  
  
It's kind of ironic when people complaining about Abramovich or the club is not patient enough with Manager or player, but if anything, the whole Courtois have to prove himself debacle is the perfect example on how some of us also have the same kind of mentality.  
  
The only way we can evaluate his quality is by letting him play, for enough amount of time (for example half the season). How can you expect him to develop understanding with the defensive line if he rarely play with them.  
  
Yes Cech have amazing understanding with the defense, but that understanding was acquired over several years of **playing together** with the defense. At the very least, in terms of **individual skill** Courtois is not losing to Cech. The only other factor that Cech have over Courtois is that *""understanding""*. Well news flash, the only way Courtois can understand our defense is by playing with them and adapt.

Liverpool have also willing to talk to give the contract to Sagna before the season finished . In addition tu , Inter Milan are also interested to get him . Sagna still has not made ​​any decisions and probably Liverpool need to quickly get him before it 's too late .

Sagna agrees to Liverpool ? Wide where he could improve Liverpool ?

Ni after the season there is also a two- word defense of our right , Glen Johnson and Martin Kelly will be sold to give a new breath Courant defense . Both diketepikan always cause injury when Kelly was still tercari kecergasan best - looking stage . It may be just one idea but who live only Jon Flanagan . He is talented but still there is a lot to learn , especially in the portion subject to attack . If sagna to Liverpool , maybe he's not a major player , but should teach the way the pros play rookie Flanagan .

Liverpool takde problem or if there GlenJo son Kelly just can not always expect diorang direhatkan forced after each season because of injury . With the style of play Liverpolol now ni , the full-back position is a lot of contact down ride and risk for injury if you do not fit . Arsenal and Liverpool's style of play was more or less the same , so Sagna will not take a long time for the match.

Although Liverpool did not always buy players who are aged but still need some players ' proven winners ' kind of Kolo Toure and Steven Gerrard to give the squad more balance experience . Sagna old will be playing at Arsenal cikgu good for Flanagan , Wisdom , etc. .

If the kid quickly get him , Sakho use as bait . Diorang right gang France squad but I think he will not play kat another EPL club Liverpool bid or may be heartening Sagna .

If we built more city centre appartments, prices would only come down a small amount because commuters would move in, and companies that previously couldn't afford city wages would move in, and the demand would match the supply again.

You want to do it fast, I get that, but you also need to do it right. 

Here's what I suggest: Find out what the cheapest places to live in are in the UK, and double check they have sufficient NHS dentistry capacity (if your mouth is that bad, the actual treatment may take place at a hospital, but you need a dentist to refer you). Work out how much it will cost you to live, it'll probably be a shitty house share, but you only need to worry about the most basic cost of living, rent, utilities, food, travel, Internet and a tiny bit extra for emergencies. *Get that money before you come*.

Anyway, dog owners and parents share responsibility to keep their child safe.

I was doing everything right — I had control of my dog on the lead. It was the parent at fault here.

My partner also had a case where she looked after a child who had been mauled by a dog owned by the child's aunt. The aunt had asked the mother not to bring the child round because the dog was frightened. The mother took the child round and let herself in *while the aunt was out* and left the child unattended with the dog. And so the child was bitten in the face after tormenting the dog. And guess who had to have their dog put down due to an enraged dumb mother pressing charges, despite the owner doing everything right to protect the child and take care of their dog. (This is the story according to the mother, unable to see how unreasonable and irresponsible she had been).

So there's several issues.

Is it ok for an adult to respond and encourage a relationship initiated by a child? For me that's a clear no. There's really no ""but in the dark she looked 18"" bullshit excuses, he knows the person knows what year they're in and has access to their pupil records.

Is sexting somehow different from other sexual relations. Like texting someone ""i wan u 2 cum on my tits"" is that lesser than shoving your hand into someone's jeans? Probably but still well outside the boundaries of an adult-child relationship.

Do things change if the pupil is over 16? Yes, legally at least, but it's still sleazy for a teacher to take advantage of his students especially if there's a significant age gap. Sleazy enough that the teacher should probably be sacked for misconduct even if he's not legally committed a crime.

As a teacher you have a moral duty to the young minds in your care, you're in loco parentis (in the place of their parents). It's just not right to let the people you're responsible develop in what can only really be an abusive sexual relationship (abusive because it's illicit and you should have stopped it).

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"I think there's a big assumption here that Chelsea and City are above the fight for fourth place. On paper, I think they should be, but I think things are so tight this season that they could easily get dragged into it. 

Chelsea are playing Everton, Spurs and Arsenal at home, which you'd expect them to win but it's far from a certainty, and then us away, which is going to be hard for them. City have us, Arsenal and Everton away, which is three tough games for them, plus a derby match that's always going to have an unpredictable element to it. Even if they beat everyone else, there's still potential for them to drop quite a few points in the big games.

If I was putting money on it, I'd still probably back them to solidly finish in the top four, but at the same time both of them have had dodgy results and performances recently and I wouldn't say either of them were looking completely safe. They're far from unbeatable at the moment. 

With regards for us, I think the key thing in this graphic is that it's in our hands. If we win our games at home (in particular the one against Spurs) and beat the teams we should beat away, then we can afford dodgy results against Southampton and United, and maybe not win one of the City/Chelsea games and still comfortably take 4th place.

Sorry, but we do not know what he was asked.

Read the two paragraphs from the Telegraph article which tell us what he said

&gt;He said: “I said exactly the same as President Barroso a few months ago when I was in Madrid and the government of Catalonia decided to launch a campaign on a referendum.

&gt;“I said they would have to become an accession state and apply to join the EU, although I said I doubted if the Catalans would ever vote for independence, although of course it is up to them. By the way, five countries have refused to recognise Kosovo. So I agree with President Barroso.” 

If he was talking about Scotland I would expect to see the word 'Scotland' in that text. And if he had used the word Scotland I would expect the Telegraph to include the word 'Scotland'. He is talking about the Catalonia situation.

Yeah, I can recommend it. I got decent tradesman, all English ( no I'm not racist or xenophobic, I just wanted tradesman who could speak the language fluently and completely understand instructions and plans in both metric and imperial i.e. what I mean by two by four or 6mm twin and earth. Not too much to ask really. ) They all did an above standard job.  

I've used the painter and decorator several times now, he even did a great job of laying the wooden floor in my front room with his mate. 

The quote system was great, I got a ton of replies. Some good, some bad - and by bad the system allowed me to weed out the quotes in pigeon english, cheapest quotes that looked too good to be true, quotes where the tradesman hassled me for a decision and quotes you could tell would have hidden costs and extra bollocks thrown in. 

Although for most tradesman you basically need to add 20% to their quote as there will be extras and you need to find out whether they include materials too ( most don't )  This is pretty standard though.

The rating system also works well; tradesman basically won't rip you off as they care about the review you're going to leave.

The 24-year-old Belgian has been in fine form in his domestic league of late, attracting attention from a number of top sides from across the continent.

Paul Lambert is one man paying particularly close attention to the emerging star as he plots his summer activity.

Odjidja-Ofoe is seen as the ideal man to slot into the Villains’ midfield, with his power and energy suitable for Premier League football.

Everton came close to snapping him up in 2012, but a deal collapsed as the transfer was hit with paperwork problems.

But Villa are confident that they can seal a switch, with a £5m offer being mooted.

The Midlanders have good connections in Belgium, and are believed to be ready to monitor his progress closely between now and the end of the season.

Odjidja-Ofoe can play on either wing or in a central role, and has developed a reputation for his ability to break into attacking areas to net vital goals.

true,h33i0,eng-westmidlands,Now London...,"What does he think the tightening of sanctions was all about?

&gt; He transferred the funds via PayPal, the international payments firm. 

No, Paypal is an American company and abides by American law, and as such abides by all American economic sanctions and embargoes. 

If you want to do business in Iran as well as the USA, you have to abide by the sanctions the US has imposed. If you want to do business in both but you dont abide by the letter of the law in the US sanctions, they will fine you or cut your access off to the US. It's really quite simple. 

In short you cant use American companies (Paypal) to try and do business with Iran. You cannot do business in Iran if you want to do business in America or with American companies (or do your business in dollars). 

These extraterritorial laws are set out in the US IFCA 2012 (Iran Freedom and Counterproliferation act) and their [extraterritorial nature are covered](http://www.clydeco.com/uploads/Files/Publications/2013/CC002530_Sanctions_Update_Jan_2013_IFCPA_17.01.13.pdf). It is not only british banks that are affected, but non-US banks across the world. 

The fines paid by these banks are the price for continued access to the US. The case of Standard Chartered is simple, they were told either pay the fine or lose their wall street banking license. [They paid the fine](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/02/us-banks-iran-idUSBRE88103O20120902). This is why even Chinese companies like Huawei have almost entirely pulled out of Iran as well as the [Chinese banks](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390444320704577562330527832056?mg=reno64-wsj&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10000872396390444320704577562330527832056.html). 

Lastly, the comparison with Thatcher is not apt. That was at the height of the cold war in which Britain was a vital strategic interest for the United States.  It could use that to leverage its position for its interests. A couple of turbines was not worth it for the US. That is no longer the case, Cameron can't tell Obama that British banks should be allowed to flout US sanctions in Iran while simultaneously still doing businesses in the US. Especially because we have our own EU sanctions on Iran and are intimately involved in the sanctions as part of the P5+1. 

The US congress is incredibly hawkish with Iran and will continue to try and make tougher and tougher sanctions (unless these current negotiations end well). The Iranian economy is in the shit because of this. There is fuck all we can do about it because the worlds banks need the US more than they need Iran, and the US congress knows this. 

The more interesting case is Oil, the US has practically tried to bully the whole world to stop buying oil from Iran. It gives out waivers to certain countries ([China, India, South Korea](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/29/us-usa-iran-waivers-idUSBRE9AS0QM20131129) etc) as long as they are actively looking for alternatives and cutting down, any increase  will cause a fine, non-agreement will cause a fine. The waivers though are given very easily, which is the Obama administration's way of sticking the finger at congress. 

All of these secondary extraterritorial sanctions are of course illegal under WTO international rules. You cannot sanction other countries for violating your countries trade sanctions, the EU for a long time threatened to take the US to the WTO dispute resolution mechanism if they did what is happening now to EU firms. These threats ended when the EU 3 agreed a couple of years ago to increase sanctions on Iran and implicitly endorsed the US policy. Now the US is using extraterritorial sanctions, the EU is kept silent by Germany, France and the UK. In their eyes it is more important to make headway on the Iran nuclear issue.

A lot of this is why the negotiations with Iran are finally making a breakthrough, everyone wants these stupid sanctions to end (except maybe the US congress).",0,1392892899,null,0,1392895403,0,cfk1kj1,t3_1yfefi,t1_cfk1kj1,t3_1yfefi,null,1432479095,32,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,32

The fact is, not everyone has the option to live where they really want. Especially if you're trying to buy a first home/flat. compromises need to be made, and commuting is realistically the easiest in terms of cash:house ratio.

My commute FLIES by. I read the times on my 7inch tablet cover to cover before I get in, on the way home I'll catch up on some tv series or a movie. alternatively I can read practically free books on my kindle or mags on the tablets. 

Tablets have revolutionised commuting. They even slot into a jacket pocket. I don't even take a bag with me anymore.

The difference for me, is that I get home into my house rather than a flat. It's a starter home, but it's grown in value because it's not some horrible new build box. We chose the location carefully, the style and the fact it was a wreck. We spent money and time carefully and it's a nice home now.

The only thing stopping us from trading up currently is stamp duty.  Were going to have too at some point if we want children, but that's a thought for another day.

[Cheapest 1 bed for rent in Plumstead](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-to-rent/property-42946969.html) is £700pcm

They're very close, location wise. 

£86,250 mortgage, £28,750 deposit (25%). Cheapest 75% LTV BTL mortgage = 2.89% fixed for 2 years. 

£2,492 to service the mortgage. £8400 taken in from tenant each year. 

So rental yield is ~7% with a best case scenario RoI of ~20% but a more likely 10% when you take into account repairs, ground rent on the flat and vacant months.

&gt;Reed, 50, from Crook, County Durham, admitted a charge of causing death by careless driving at an earlier court hearing

.

&gt;His barrister, Christopher Dorman-O'Gowan, told Judge Peter Armstrong that he had been a hard-working man all of his adult life.

So?

&gt;Miss Egerton said Mr Ruff would have been visible for at least nine seconds or from 227 metres away.

Everyone count to 9

&gt;Witnesses said he did not brake or deviate, even after the collision

.

&gt;Reed claimed in his police interview he had seen the cyclist, but there was too much traffic in lane two for him to pull out, and too much traffic behind for him to stop.

.

&gt;Witness accounts do not support that, they say lane two was empty

.

&gt;Reed, of Railway Terrace, Willington, has criminal convictions from 30 years ago, and a more recent conviction for speeding, the court heard.

.

&gt;In passing sentence, I am bound to follow the guidelines for judges in such cases.




It boggles my mind how this can keep happening. I've been accused of being oversensitive in such cases in the past, or even paranoid, but really....Look at the facts.

Everyone should care about this - this attitude is being passed onto pedestrians involved in car collisions too.

As people have mentioned in this thread, commuting time isn't wasted. You can catch up on work, tv, news and reading. 

What exactly is an 'acceptable' commute? 10 mins? 20 mins? to buy a similar sized house (that isn't in a council estate) within walking distance of my office would mean I need 600-700k. Probably more. I don't have that kind of cash.

I would say it is worth it. You're already going to invest the time to create a first class CV, so just transpose that same information into your linkedin profile. 

If you're networking, LinkedIn gives you a handy way to keep in contact with the people you meet. They can check you out and vice versa and it's easy for them to contact you in future. Just, make sure you have a decent, professional looking photo - *not* you on holiday or whatever ! :) 

Business cards are dead cheap. You could do worse than getting a few hundred, not fancy, cards printed off with your contact details, email / linked in / blog etc.

tip: Just my personal approach, is I *never* go to networking events with the intention of getting anything from anybody. ""My"" theory is that success is 95% turning up, so I turn up. You meet people, some of whom you'll connect with. Others you'll learn something from and vice versa. Occasionally, someone you meet will offer you an opportunity in the future (and vice versa). I don't think I've ever been to a network event that didn't *significantly* expand my understanding of the world!

You could also do worse than reading ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napolean Hill. Particularly the section about creating a ""CV"". 

IMO, there are two types of CV: First is the bland ""keyword stuffed"" typical CV favoured by recruiters and mostly read by keyword filtering machines. You do probably need one of these CVs. 

The second is the type of CV described by Napolean Hill that you send (or maybe even hand deliver) to the MD of the company you want to work for (you know his name because you've researched him and his company).

I spent the first 10 years of my career largely under challenged simply because I looked for jobs far too passively. (ie I looked a job ads / newspapers and recruitment agents). If I had the time again, I would be *much* more proactive - easy to say though because I now have valuable skills and experience so it's hard to put myself back in the mindset I had 20 years ago.

&gt;If they genuinely believe this relationship is ""the one"", they should have the sense to move school (which, if the pupil is 16+, makes the relationship legal again), or wait until the pupil has left.

Exactly.  That's where you have to question their judgment and their intention. Ultimately they are not putting the younger person's best interests first.

It sounds like in your situation the guy was a clear predator, but in cases [like this](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/9238784/Teacher-who-left-career-to-marry-pupil-has-split-up-with-her.html) it really does seem to have been more limited, he had had possibly one other pupil affair before.  It's interesting they decided not to prosecute:

&gt;Officials at Aberdeen City Council reported Mr Forrester to police, sparking an investigation that resulted in him being charged under the Sexual Offences Act. However, the Crown Office decided the case was ""not in the public interest"" and did not prosecute.

In that situation he claimed to have not consummated the relationship before she was 16. Whereas with Jeremy Forrest the girl was 15.  Even then, I am not sure it was in the public interest to go to the lengths they did, though they had little choice as it was technically an abduction. 

But from what I have read about that girl she is so incredibly damaged and traumatised from the media and police attention - as much as, if not more so - than from the actual relationship.

It is interesting to note that the first Regeneration was never called that directly but rather 'renewal' which didn't have an obvious cause other than old age. This is similar to the war doctor's cause for regeneration which is then directly alluded to the first with the same reason stated by the doctor for both - ""wearing a bit thin.""

Interestingly, the first doctor states that the TARDIS is crucial to the renewal process, yet several regenerations have taken place outside the TARDIS:

2nd Regeneration - may have begun outside the TARDIS, but we first see the third doctor with him falling out of the TARDIS.

3rd Regeneration - several feet outside the TARDIS.

4th Regeneration - outdoors under a radio tower.

7th Regeneration - In a San Fransisco hospital morgue.

13th regeneration - outdoors on a clock tower - but completed inside the TARDIS.

River song regenerates outside the TARDIS on two separate occasions.

Shortly after the second regeneration from Troughton into Pertwee, it was written in a Doctor Who magazine that renewal shouldn't be confused with regeneration. 

Since so many regenerations happens outside the TARDIS, it is possible that the original intent was that renewal was a process where the doctor reverts to a younger version of himself to prolong his life, with regeneration being an emergency healing process.

It is likely that over time the Doctor Who production staff simply ignored or didn't care for the difference, and decided to simplify the two to be the same process which is not reliant on the TARDIS, as they both accomplish the same task of replacing the actor.",0,1392898291,null,0,false,0,cfk2dzc,t3_1yf7ft,t1_cfk2dzc,t3_1yf7ft,null,1432479479,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

The other guys have answered the questions on crime and location very well so nothing to add there, except to reiterate the point that Birmingham is generally a very safe city and you wont have any problems.

Cotteridge and Kings Norton are also well connected and out of the main student area.

Snobs is nightclub, but moreso a Birmingham institution.  It's been there for years.  Everyone has a Snobs story, it's part of our heritage!  However, due to redevelopment it's moving this summer so by the time you arrive it will be in it's new location just off Smallbrook Queensway. What becomes of it is yet to be known!

Nobody is denying the man was odd and right now when you watch recordings of him and think ""he was a pedo rapist"" it's very easy to believe it.

But nobody has proved it yet. We have lots of people accusing him - and he's not here to defend himself. Nobody can say whether these people are telling the truth or lying, that's the only fact we have.

It's highly suspicious that these people waited until he was dead before coming out with all of these revelations.

I also find it sad that everyone is quick to say ""yes of course he did it"" when we can't have any kind of trial to prove it - and when all these other trials have proven that the men in question were innocent (Bill Roache, Dave Lee Travis, Michael Le Vell - as I say in my linked comment.)

Your biggest cost, is the land, by far and away, unless your are making flats.

Flats are different there are often local by laws and such, but generally the builders want to fit as many separate dwellings as possible.  This is a side-effect of our massively limited supply.

As for the actual cost of a house that has tiny rooms, vs one that has large rooms in construction costs (materials and labour) is really quite small, considering how much more you would be able to charge.

Often however, councils reject larger buildings, my council restricted the height of the building I live in.  So the ceilings are the legal minimum.  The architect had planned them higher.

A developer would much rather get more profit from the land, building bigger, larger, more luxury buildings, but often aren't encouraged.

However, the most bat shit insane thing we do is simple, we look at houses on 'rooms' not SQM.  I've never seen this in any other country I've lived, or friends I've stayed with.  When I was living in a double wide (trailer park!) in the states, the question everyone asked was how many square feet of space I had.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"&gt;did the closing of the barrier cause the people upstream more hassle?

No. The Thames is tidal through most of London. When the tide is going out, the river flows out to the sea. When the tide is coming in, the river flows inland from the sea. 

When a high tide happens at the same time as heavy rainfall upstream, water flows from the sea inland and meets water flowing from upstream. So the tidal stretch of the Thames is being filled up from the seaward end and from the upstream end. This fills up and potentially overflows the   tidal stretch, and further upstream as well because the water from upstream can't flow into the tidal stretch because it's already full. 

Closing the barrier as the tide comes in stops water flowing from the sea into the tidal stretch. Even better, you can wait till the tidal stretch is nearly empty at low tide, and close the barrier. This leaves a nice empty tidal stretch which can be filled up by water from upstream.

Think of it as a bathtub with a tap at one end (upstream) and a tap and plughole at the other end (the sea). At low tide, it's as if the tap at the sea end is turned off and the plughole opens. At high tide, the tap at the sea end is turned on and the plughole is closed. Closing the barrier when the tide is coming in is like turning off the tap at the sea end: as less water is flowing into the bath, it gets less full and is less likely to overflow and bring your kitchen ceiling down.

That's nice, but has nothing to do with my point.

I'm a maths geek, a programmer, a engineer, a pilot, the tools of my trade do not care about emotion or such, 2+2=4 even if that means a cute kitten dies.

So please don't try and argue with such emotive words.

As I've said, there are consequences to taxing businesses.  It does not mean you are taxing the rich.  For instance you could go buy a bunch of ADRs and pay at the very most less than a third of that income be taxed.  That makes no sense to me.

This is why I say tax people.  Income that is earned by having a job, should be treated no differently to income that is earned from an investment.

Given that many companies provide services used by people from all walks of live, taxing those companies will result in customers being taxed.  Sometimes that will mean the poorest been taxed disproportionately.  This is again why I say to tax more wealthy people, not organisations.

At the other end of the scale, you have people like a good friend of mine.  He runs a company, it is looking like it will be struggingling this year.  He employs two people including himself, he had turnover of less than £55k.  His accountancy fees made up about 5% of his gross revenue.  This is insane.  He isn't doing anything cunning, he isn't offshoring, or LBT or any other dodges.  He is been hit by the desire to tighten up taxes.  Given that he and his other employee (who happens to be his lover!) make less than the median wage for a graduate you can not say that these do not have big impacts on his quality of life.

Now I'm a realist, I'm a smart guy, I've achieved a lot and lucky to have some modest life style strapping to show for it (I still don't own my own plane.... yet.).

Given that the next biggest cost was about £2k, yes this is very significant.  In UK parlance, gross revenue and turnover are the same thing so yes, I did mean that.

The only other significant costs where their salaries.

&gt;I have two major problems with this. In the first instance, fifty-five hundred pounds is not an unreasonable sum to pay for professional business accounting. The fact it represents 10% of his turnover is representative of the fact that his turnover is very small, not that the taxation system is inherently unworkable.

As the turnover comes from transactions that are always over £500, I strongly disagree.

This effectively means the cost of applying the corp tax, has increased by 5%.  For a very small business.  Probably the smallest you could be, whilst not being ST.

&gt;The fact that a two person enterprise has a turnover (are you quite certain you meant to use this word?) of £55,000 tells us next to nothing about how 'the system' is inimical to entrepreneurs but a great deal about the soundness of your friend's business plan.

Right, they aren't trying hard enough to succeed.  Where do people on this subreddit think jobs come from?  Two people, with a company they built are making more than enough to live on.  Rather than say, isn't it stupid that a company which has tiny turnover, has to follow so many guidelines, wouldn't it be simpler to produce a simplified tax system?  If they got another say 20 customers next year, they would potentially be earning six figure sums each.  But no, let's criticise them.

Slightly longer answer: The fact that he didn't tends to imply that he was talking in general about the Catalan situation because that is what he means when he says ""a few months ago when I was in Madrid"" {[link to an earlier Telegraph article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10517361/Herman-Van-Rompuy-deals-EU-blow-to-Alex-Salmonds-independence-plans.html)} which says pretty much the same as this latest article, although there is an slight explanation regarding the Article 48 or 49 entry.

Long answer: The reason there are differences between Scotland and Catalonia is that the UK has agreed to treat the outcome of the referendum as binding and with good faith.

The way Catalonia would have to enter the EU is by [Article 49](http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/136-article-49.html). That is what van Rumpoy is talking about.

The [Scottish Government](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2013/11/5894/5) is talking about entering via [Article 48](http://www.lisbon-treaty.org/wcm/the-lisbon-treaty/treaty-on-european-union-and-comments/title-6-final-provisions/135-article-48.html) which requires amending existing treaties to reflect the new position that Scotland would find itself in. (Catalonia couldn't use this because Spain is playing silly buggers).

This article from December 2012 gives the reasoning of [Professor Sir David Edward, a former European Court judge](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20757450) which makes sense to me - if they vote for independence it is in the rUK's interests for Scotland to be strong and in the EU, and why would other countries want to cause problems? Spain would play nice just to gain access to Scotland's fishing grounds.

It must be noted though that the only opinion that is correct will be the one that the EU passes when or if Scotland gets to ask if they can join the EU as an independent country, everything else is bollocks. It will not be decided by the opinion of one person, whoever they are, nor by how many times various media groups rehash words into different meanings to suit their own purposes.",0,1392908977,null,0,false,0,cfk5d8a,t3_1ycuwu,t1_cfk5d8a,t1_cfk3o4a,null,1432480882,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,thatbloke83,null,null,"My hometown of Gosport:

Largest town in the UK without its own Railway station. You have to get a 30-40 min bus to Fareham (costing around £4.70 return) or cross over to Portsmouth Harbour on a ferry service (Last I checked it had gone over £3 for a ticket) to get to the nearest train station.

I don't have a source for this but I was once told that it was at one point 5th highest place in Europe for teenage pregnancies. I'm not surprised in the slightest.

[According to this BBC News report](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-26037619) it has the 6th-highest level of overweight or obese people in the UK.

For a town of over 90,000 people, there is a *single lane* road that leads to the nearest motorway, which has to be shared with Fareham's own traffic too. Consequently, trying to get in/out of Gosport during Rush Hour **will** take you about 45-60 mins to get from the point where you leave the motorway at Fareham (M27 J11) to a point where you're moving at a speed that's more than about 3mph.

The town centre is *completely* dead. Any shops worth visiting were finally killed off when the town council *insisted* that car parking charges for the town centre must be implemented. Now, because people have to pay for parking anyway, they will go either to Fareham or Portsmouth in their cars, because there are actually shops worth visiting in those places.

There is a reason that house prices in Gosport are actually quite cheap - there's absolutely nothing there that is worth staying for. About half the pubs I used to frequent while I lived there have also since closed down, and there's absolutely *nothing* to do in town, particularly for younger people, which is why things like vandalism, violence, petty crime and also drug dealing seems to be so common in certain areas of the town.

As a further consequence of being so cheap, it's generally full of various no-hopers and people who never really amount to much at all, ever.

Its own hospital, Haslar, which also was the last remaining ""Military"" hospital in the country (you may have seen it mentioned frequently on the news for quite some time) was closed down a number of years ago, meaning the nearest hospital is a minimum of 12 miles away (Queen Alexandra hospital in Cosham), but due to the traffic, even on a good day it will still take &gt;30 mins to get there.

Dr Barton, who was the GP who you also frequently appeared on the news over the last few years for apparently killing people at the War Memorial hospital in Gosport *was my GP for as long as I can remember*. (side note: she was actually very good at what she did).

I'm glad I got the hell out when I could.",0,1392909674,null,0,false,0,cfk5n44,t3_1yd50e,t1_cfk5n44,t3_1yd50e,null,1432481012,6,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,6

I suspect that the Chinese NOCs are using domestically produced equipment though, so export regulations won't be an issue for them.

&gt;

&gt;**Rotoscoping** is an [animation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation) technique in which [animators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animator) trace over footage, [frame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(film\)) by frame, for use in live-action and [animated films](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animated_film).   Originally, recorded live-action film images were projected onto a frosted glass panel and re-drawn by an animator. This projection equipment is called a rotoscope, although this device was eventually replaced by computers.

&gt;In the [visual effects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_effects) industry, the term rotoscoping refers to the technique of manually creating a [matte](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matte_(filmmaking\)) for an element on a live-action plate so it may be [composited](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing) over another background.

It's incredibly large military presence, its ""nuclear umbrella"" over most of Europe keeps this continent peaceful. It does it by treating us Europeans as children, but it does it nonetheless. If the guarantee of nuclear protection and military protection goes away, who will be the guarantor of European safety? Can the UK and France stop Russia waltzing into Estonia? With considerable difficulty maybe. But we certainly won't give them a nuclear umbrella. How will the France and the UK especially react if Germany begins building up its forces and gains nuclear weapons (it can quite easily) in the absence of the US to protect Germany? It would make them incredibly uneasy. France and the UK were already hesitant to let Germany re-unite and only allowed it after considerable reassurance. You might say we have moved on from the bickering of the past, but you cant be certain.

An example would be the situation with Gibraltar. The Spanish ships that continually breach the sovereign waters. If Spain makes a bid to take it, how much force will we use to stop it? How will the UK react if there is no huge american presence here to check any hostilities? They wont make a bid now of course, because they would lose and become pariahs but can we be sure of their intentions when there is no single supreme military force on the continent that would squash them?

The EU as an instrument has dampened it down, and our great economic interdependence has helped considerably but that has shown to be [futile in the past](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Illusion). Because while economics matters, but there are times when politics trumps economics and those instances are what cause conflict. To give you an example, China is incredibly dependent on the global economy, on the US and on Europe. But it has categorically said, time and time again, it will invade Taiwan if Taiwan declares independence. That would mean a direct war with the US which would be devastating for its economy. Politics trumps economics there. Gibraltar can be a flash point, or any other nationalistic issue within Europe (Hungary and Trianon, Balkans etc). There are unresolved tensions on this continent. 

The consensus of course is, with the ""pivot"" to asia, America will be pivoting out of Europe. Probably slowly over time, but can we Europeans find a way to guarantee all of our safety without resorting to the US or the small minded national interests focused policy of the past? That's the million pound question, and of course, EU federalists would say the answer lies with the EU. But who knows, I simply hope we have truly moved on from our past.

Except, for the role he's obtained, you'd generally be expected to have demonstrated enough achievements before. Just look at the resume of his predecessor! Shinner might very well be highly capable, but really hasn't achieved all that much in his working life so far. 

I would generally be one of the first to condemn automatic knee-jerk reactions against appointments like this. However, all the factors combined - worked at Tory HQ, educational experience based upon working at his own school (which happens to be 5km from Gove's constituency!), comparative age vis a vis other candidates, helping set up a free school with the aid of a think tank founded by Gove.... it seems doubtful that the appointment was made entirely on merit. 

The bare minimum has been done for it to be somewhat defensible in the public domain but in my opinion, the likelihood of other factors coming into play is astoundingly high.

true,impablomations,northumberland,Northumberland,"&gt; To be fair, ATOS only does what the DWP tells them to

No.  They are incompetent at applying the rules they are supposed to follow and their staff are incredibly incompetent.

My friends assessment was a complete joke.  The 'Dr' kept asking her to wiggle her toes and move her foot around, she kept reminding him that she had prosthetic legs.  A few minutes later he would ask her to wiggle her toes again, as if to try and catch her lying - again she reminded him she didn't have any feet.

After the 3rd time of being asked, she took one of her legs off and put it on the desk and told him to move the toes/foot himself if he could and the Dr just gave her a blank look.

Fast forward a few weeks later and she was denied DLA, the report said she had no mobility problems and had been 'observed' moving her toes and feet.

Or my own case.  I was turned down for DLA - I'd had 3 heart attacks in the past 2 years, could walk maybe 15yds before stopping, had fluid on my lungs, as well as other heart related issues and was waiting to go into hospital for investigative procedures to find out if a triple or quad bypass was needed.

My report said I had no problems walking, had been 'observed' (theres that word again) running across the car park, and that I had no problems breathing - at the time I was using maybe 1/2 my lung capacity because of the fluid on them.

Had to go to tribunal, they decided in my favour in less than 5 minutes and were so shocked at my treatment and the blatant bullshit on the ATOS report, that they were going to forward an official complaint.

I know many similar stories from other disabled friends - ATOS aren't just doing what they are told, they are deliberately falsifying reports to get results, and are all round grossly incompetent - THAT is why they should be dumped and maybe even sued for submitting fraudulent reports.

After all, if I submitted fraudulent paperwork to the DSS to get money, wouldn't I get prosecuted for it?

In the school my kids go to, they occasionally get reception pupils who virtually can't speak - they have less than a dozen words. They use speech therapists and special nurture groups and usually these kids are transformed within a few months. 

They also track data and use one to one tuition to improve pupils with poor literacy or numeracy. This needs to be done as early as possible, though some primary schools wait till Y5 so that they get better results in the National Curriculum Tests.

This is all paid for by the Pupil Premium, so schools in poorer areas ought to have more resources to do this kind of thing. 

But a good school can only do so much: I've seen studies that suggest they only make a marginal difference, and parents and local culture are the most significant factor.

Sorry for chewing your ear off in the following, but I see very little people talking publically about this issue from a stance of distrust (as if the governments track record is fantastic) and I feel I raise some important questions.

This ambiguous piece from the nhs keeps on being repeated as if it's clear..

""Your date of birth, full postcode, NHS Number and gender rather than your name will be used to link your records in a secure system, managed by the HSCIC. Once this information has been linked, a new record will be created. This new record will not contain information that identifies you.

This statement contradicts itself and is vague on purpose. We will sell nothing that identifies you, yet your nhs number is in the database. Why? Keep in mind this database is not for medical staff in hospitals, practices ect. 

We have had no black and white confirmation that it is not part of the deal. 'This record will not contain information that identifies you' is extremely vague and it's quite possible for them to be including the nhs number as primary care data (which may be for sale, who would actually know the information on care.data is so obscure?). I just want to know what is for sale, what isn't..and if it isn't for sale, why is the nhs number even involved? Everyone forgive me if I don't put too much confidence into 'The type of information shared, and how it is shared, is controlled by law and strict confidentiality rules.' Woopdee shit.  The whole thing stinks.

Just imagine how much this information is actually worth to a lot of companies, and then follow it back to the group of people who specifically got this law (Health and Social Care Act 2012) passed to make it (and many other things) happen.

Watching their games. the only advantage they have is that they can obtain recording easier and can go to the stadiums and watch them live. But generally scouts dont even do that because watching the games digitally is generally more efficient because you can watch him closer and have replays and so on. 

But you dont need 20 screens and the money to fly out to Switzerland to get the general picture of what a player is like.  T. Hazard won the player of the year award in a better league while being younger. According to your logic why didnt we just recall him or wait until summer to bring him back? What makes him undeveloped but Salah already Chelsea starting quality?

In a world of speculation, a fetish someone might have for piece of metal that can probably be trivially be reproduced by its manufacturer, can be everything. The intellectual property associated with a particular item prohibits anyone from reproducing it despite the often trivially small amount of labour associated in producing said item, is what, I guess, people are paying for... At least with antiques the manufacturing process may be dead, forgotten, illegal or the raw materials now scarce.

The fact that the royal mint could probably just make more (and could probably manufacturer a scarcity of said fetish, or even produce coins after the fact) doesn't seem to cross the people reading these press releases minds. If anything, maybe the government should do this to raise revenue from people with an obsession and too much spare money.

Its pretty much the same logic as diamonds, which aren't very rare their supply is just kept artificially low by a cartel of people with a huge marketing campaign behind them.

As a Kings Norton resident, this made me snort.

OP, I would investigate the public transport network. You'll find this opens up your choices of location tenfold. The cross-city Train line runs for 15 miles or so in and out of the City Centre, with a station right in the centre of the Uni campus. Using this alone, you're looking at anywhere from Longbridge, Northfield, the Five Ways redevelopment, out to Sutton Coldfield, all within 20 minutes easy journey time.

Bus links along the Bristol Road are excellent, with a bus every few seconds. Again, this makes Longbridge and Northfield very viable locations, along with Selly Park and Edgbaston again.

Between Harborne and Selly Park, I'd choose the latter. Harborne si a little bit too up itself and expensive.

In the comic books, Superman tends to be a problem with fans because they can't relate to him. He does not have a tragic past. He does not have a human weakness to overcome. He is not a stranger to the world, but grew up on it. And a lot of other things that make fans not like Superman. 

What a lot of people don't get about Superman is you are not supposed to relate to him. He is someone you are supposed to look up towards and strive to become. He does not live in shades of grey. To him, the world is black and white. Superman is not angsty. He may have crises if faith, but not often. To him, people can change to become better. Superman does not take the easy way out of things. Superman does not act, he reacts to what the villains are doing.

With a character like that, the best thing you can do is construct the universe that he lives in. You give Superman a stellar supporting cast. You create interesting villains that reflect some aspect of the main character. You create a universe that is good, but flawed in some capacity. Basically, you do all the things that the writers have done with Batman over the years, except you leave out the human back story.

This is how Doctor Who works. He's the Superman of his universe and he can be a bit boring, but the everything else about Doctor Who, that's the interesting part. ",0,1392916934,null,0,false,0,cfk8vog,t3_1ygamg,t1_cfk8vog,t3_1ygamg,null,1432482603,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The fact that he illustrated his agreement by saying that he made the same point about Catalonia does not mean he didn't have Scotland in mind.  How you can possibly think

&gt;So I agree with President Barroso.

in the context of a question about Barroso's statement on Scotland is not a reflection of his views on Scotland is absolutely beyond me.

&gt;It must be noted though that the only opinion that is correct will be the one that the EU passes when or if Scotland gets to ask if they can join the EU as an independent country, everything else is bollocks. It will not be decided by the opinion of one person, whoever they are, nor by how many times various media groups rehash words into different meanings to suit their own purposes.

This is absolutely true.  However, it is the height of self-deception to contend that two of the people in the world who are best placed to judge the responses of the members of the EU as a whole do not have a valid contribution to make to the debate about what will probably happen.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"Fairness sounds good. Who could be against fairness? This is why politicians use the word so often. It sounds positive and it means whatever they want it to mean. 

In an era of full employment and scarcity, people who actively chose not to work were freeloading off everyone else. 

It's not like that any more. Because of globalisation and automation, unskilled work is declining and won't come back. We're going to have to live with a lot more unemployment. We don't need to have scarcity any more: consumer goods have never been cheaper to produce. 

We need to decide how we're going to handle this. 

At the moment we're pretending that people can find work if we only sanction them a bit more, make their lives a bit more difficult. With five unemployed people for every vacancy, that already doesn't work. How is it fair to penalise someone for not being able to find non-existent work? 

And at the moment we're promoting artificial scarcity. People on benefits shouldn't have nice housing, shouldn't have a spare room, should jump through pointless hoops *even though this costs the taxpayer as much or more than the alternative*.

Generally wages should be higher than benefits, to give an incentive for people to do the unpleasant jobs we need. This doesn't mean that all the corner cases need to be ruthlessly hunted down and eliminated, that we should find the worst and least well paid job and make sure that everyone on benefits is paid less than that. 

Even in simple economic terms this isn't going to work: when nearly everyone doesn't have a disposable income, who's going to buy goods and services to keep our economy going? 

One solution that's been proposed by economists of both left and right is a [basic income](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income). This would quite neatly sort all of the above out, wouldn't cost any more than our current welfare system, and would make sure that unskilled work always paid more than benefits.

true,Kousetsu,eng-lincolnshire,Humberside motherfucker!,"Well, I know you don't know much about what has gone on with Jimmy saville, as I can tell by the way you speak of it, but here are some of the issues:   
Many women went to many *different* (this is important) police forces. These police forces would do one of two things: 
- outright not believe them.    
- question Jimmy, but then he would convince them that people just ""did this to him"" all the time. They were somehow satisfied with that and dismissed the women.   
One of the major points that came out of the whole thing is the fact that police forces do not have a shared database (no, seriously. This was rectified *last month.*   
Before that, if you moved to a different county and then did a criminal background check, nothing would come up if you had done something where you used to live. My friend works in recruitment and recently had to let someone go after the new checks came in).   

Because the police didn't share information, the fact that all these women were reporting him up and down the country got *missed*.     

On top of that, most of these were *historic rapes*. As I'm sure you're aware, rape is difficult to take to court anyway, as in most cases it is a my word vs. your word argument (that ""hearsay"" you seem to think we can't use). Police don't really want to even take it to court because they feel like it is a waste of time and money to not even end up with a conviction. So why use the limited resources?    

It's why they are going so hard on the historic rape cases now, to save face. (The verdict was *not* innocent, by the way. It was not guilty. They are different.

true,YourLizardOverlord,eng-sussex,Scotland --&gt; West Sussex,"Partially disagree this time. The US military presence in Europe was a vital contribution to peace during the cold war, but it's an irrelevance now. 

The EU has made Europe so inextricably linked economically that an internecine war is extremely improbable. Before the World Wars our economies were nowhere near as interdependent. 

The big danger as you mentioned are small outstanding issues such as Gibraltar, but not because Spain will try to take it back by force. They almost certainly won't. But they will indulge in posturing, sailing their ships into UK territorial waters and the like, for domestic political reasons. This could encourage the UK to indulge in some posturing of their own, and one thing could lead to another. But the presence or absence of the US won't make much difference. 

This leaves external forces such as Russia. Apart from its nuclear weapons, Russia is much weaker than in the days of the cold war, and doesn't represent a significant military threat. The bigger risk is Europe's energy dependence on Russia. Putin has already tried to get his own way in Ukraine by giving them a discount on gas prices. If Ukraine gets a new government and joins the EU (and NATO?) then Russia can put us all out of business by say a 50% price hike. Energy independence is the solution here, not a US military presence. 

Finally our military alliance with the US has led us in to unnecessary adventures in the Middle East that haven't been in the national interest. A more arms length relationship would be to our advantage.

His ability to intercept passes and make tackles in the opposition half will give England something special that they probably won't be able to get from other players. It's been quite some time since I've watched a full England match, but they have been very slow in attacking development and Sterling will be able to help massively in the progression to the final third. Also, his chemistry with Sturridge will be very useful for England, as they work well together moving forward. England always lacks chemistry between players and a few players working well together will make a big difference.

On a sidenote, I think Flanagan would bring more to England than Sterling right now.

Accident

An unfortunate incident that happens unexpectedly and **unintentionally**, typically resulting in damage or injury.

Also:

Murder.
The unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another.

Premeditated.
Think out or plan (an action, especially a crime) beforehand.

true,The-infamous-lampy,,"Pint of the Doom Bar, cheers love. ","I personally don't really understand electronic music. Some of it I enjoy but most of it flies over my head. The stuff I do like kind of falls into [this bracket of things](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rUnDlBL13cg&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrUnDlBL13cg) but unless I'm off my nut on some description of elicit substance the stuff they play in clubs doesn't bother me in the slightest. 

I think part of the problem is that I quite like the poetry of lyrics and often I find that lacking within electronic music. The way that someone like Bob Dylan, Morrissey and on more modern terms Alex Turner or Frank Turner paint an emotive picture in your mind with their choice of words assisted by the music and the mood that creates to me is what music is. The electronic music I've found the lyrics, if any at all, tend to be something roughly along the lines of ""I would like to fornicate that member of the opposite sex""

I am also a musician, not a very good one but I have grade 5 music theory, a BTEC national in music performance, grade 8 on drums and I can form a tune if I play guitar and sing. So my perception of music is very much tuned to hearing a real instrument being manipulated by a human being to create pleasant noises. Not that I'm taking away from the skill involved with producing at all, I have an A level in Music Technology so I understand the challenges of sequencing music and the skill required in that and no matter what your medium there's still a lot of skill in the creative process.

Having said all of that I have to admit I have in the past been known to say something along the lines of ""electronic music is for idiots."" Or ""I don't understand why people would like electronic music"" and I have no real defence for that other than to say that's to do with my perception of reality. The only things I know are what my senses have perceived and no matter how I try I can't perceive them in the same way that you do. 

A good friend of mine has been trying to convince me for ages but nothing ever blew my hair back. Consider that a challenge if you like but I will warn you he knows my music tastes very well and hasn't managed it.

I agree that we need cover for Kompany, as he sometimes enters a period of time where it seems he's almost made out of glass or something, but I'm really not sure about old Demi-boy. In my opinion, he's a good reader of the game and wagers on an aggressive style of pressing, however, his downfall becomes his pace almost all the time. I was dumbfounded at the decision to play him against the likes of Alexis Sanchez and Messi, but I realise that this is just my opinion and that there are probably a lot of people who are fond of the battling Argentine. He's excellent at slotting into the side, but he's a huge, gaping tactical hole in the defensive plan if the other team has even so much as one semi-pacey forward as far as I'm concerned. The thing is, it becomes even more important to have a pacey backline when you play a high defensive line with full-backs bombing up and down each side the way ours do. As our roster looks to stand next season, we shouldn't delve into the market in my opinion, though. Keep Rekik in and around the first team, play Nasty as well, and at one point it will become obvious who should play the majority of the games between those two.

It's sensible in that the players benefit from getting time on the pitch, and we then benefit as a club because they come back, in theory, as better players. 

The sustainability thing is pretty obvious I guess, but if you buy young players, try them out, make them better players, and sell the ones who don't work out, then you are likely making a profit or at least coming close to breaking even. In the days of FFP this is becoming more and more important. 

I also think it helps the club's image because we're showing ambition to move beyond being a ""splash the cash on established talent"" club and becoming one that promotes from within and supplements from the outside in other positions. Even Barcelona doesn't field a 100% homegrown squad (though they could), so I don't think that should be our goal, but the idea of having young players that we've brought up through our own system is really appealing to me.

One of the more dangerous aspects of it is the oneupmanship involved and I believe although I can't be bothered to find a source that some people have died because of this. At that point it becomes a problem. It won't be stopped by people complaining but eventually people will tire of it and it will fade into obscurity. 

In the short term I think people need to be reminded that if they are going to do it that there are more important things than looking cool on the internet and not dying/ damaging your long term health are definitely in the spectrum.

Actually, I don't care about the guy in his mid-20's (or older) dying from it. That guy should know better. If it wasn't this that killed him it would be trying to lick crumbs out of the toaster.

In a moral sense it's detestable but it's really what needs to be done. This is business, it's ruthless, but I really think Chelsea are ahead of the curve here.

It's incredibly difficult to accurately judge youth prospects, with a prime example being Gael Kakuta. Once thought to be the next pinnacle of football, he's rather withered. Simply improving our youth team setup is not a legitimate answer to improving our squad, at best we'll get a good player or two every few years. Every squad will rely on outside signings to stay competitive and Chelsea are the same.

I think buying a load of attacking midfielders has been a great move for Chelsea. They play attractive football, they garner a lot of attention, and as such, are some of the most expensive players. There's obviously no need for as many as we've bought, but other teams will covet them and pay a premium for them - look at our sales of de Bruyne and Mata, simply fringe players for us but commanding big transfer fees. Those fees are then spent on areas where our squad needs proper improvement, notably midfield and central defense.

Assuming the Master wasn't lying, and that events since have not prevented the Valeyard's eventual existence it will be between the Doctor's 12th and final regeneration. So somewhere between Capaldi and the last regeneration.

true,Drugba,MN,mongolia,"&gt; Is Chelsea’s use of the loan system wrong? 

No. I know a lot of ""Football purists"" and the goon brigade over in /r/soccer will make that claim, that it's unfair and all that other bull shit, but guess what. That's how business works. Whether people like to admit it or not, the EPL is no longer an English league, it's gone global and the clubs are businesses now.

There are still a lot of little clubs in England where you can wake up every Sunday, meet the players before the game and a ticket costs a fiver, but that isn't the EPL. I do feel sorry for the people who have been following these clubs all their lives and have now lost their local club to the business it's become, I really do, but more often than not the people who bitch about this (especially on /r/soccer) picked their club because they are the best on FIFA, and are now pissy because we've got a sugar daddy who loves us.

These players we send out on loan are investments. I don't get why it's so hard for people to grasp that concept. Look at a player like Atsu who we picked up recently. Is he really ever going to make it in the team? No. But if we can buy him for 3m, loan him out, and sell him on for 5 next year, fuck you'd have to be stupid not to do it.

People (again /r/soccer) bitch and moan about Chelsea's loan policy, and then go on to praise feeder clubs like Ajax and Benfica for constantly being able to bring up great tallent. How stupid. We've found a way to do that without the middle man. Look at Matic, we basically just sent him on a 3 year loan spell... oh, but it cost us 25 million. Our loan system is built around making sure that doesn't happen and I see nothing wrong with it.

&gt; Is this the best system for our long term future? 

Yes. We are global super club now and we need to stay that way. Again, I feel sorry for all the people who grew up with Chelsea as their local club and have seen it become a global business, but that has already happened and there is no use crying over spilled milk.

We need to be consistently good, or it will cost us a lot of money and possible a lot of players. Need an example, look at the red side of Manchester.

The only way to consitanly compete at the highest level, while ensuring our future success, without spending a boat load of money, is how we are doing it now. We're just finding a way to make being a top level club sustainable.

&gt; Can we expect many of our current loanee list to start for us in the future?

Yes, and No. Depends on what you mean by many. I would probably say in the future well see maybe 30% come through the ranks into the first team, but as I said before, that isn't the point of most of these players. 

They are investments. For the other 70%, we'll buy them, pay them small wages (but better than what they'd get playing in somewhere like the Spanish second division) for a few years and then sell them for a small to medium profit. We then use that money to fill in the gaps in our squad and comply with FFP.

Clubs like Arsenal will bitch and moan about what we are doing, but they are just mad that we have the money and the know-how to do this before they did. We just took their amateur hour sustainability game and went pro.

I've seen someone mention that even Charlie Adam is doing great for Stoke. So, does that it mean its the same? As BR didn't want Charlie Adam. I think not. It's because BR wants certain traits in every player. Pace, good technical skills, hard work (run around the pitch/ track back/ provide support for other players). That's where Charlie Adam was a failure for us. He used to and still can pick a great ball but his problem was he used to try too many fancy long balls, which just doesnt fit in our system.

But Assaidi, IMO, has some the traits that BR wants. Only time will tell if he'll be able to adapt to our tactics and play in our way.

That inquiry should be led by credible people, get all the facts out there and that if anything wrong were found there should be immediate action taken and the changes to the organisation made so that they could not happen again.

true,h33i0,eng-westmidlands,Now London...,"It's perfectly fine to disagree, I'm an unabashed realist which is not the most popular school of thought in IR. There are other arguments that hold just as much weight as the gloomy picture I put forward. No one can tell you what the right theory is, because the future has not happened! 

When I say invasion, I dont necessarily mean a sudden invasion or a unilateral strike. Naturally it coincides with rising escalation and tension which makes the prospect of using force higher. The use of that force comes as consequence of the rising tension. 

My point about interdependence was not that it did not make war improbable, but that it did not *eliminate* the prospect of war. Interdependence is one of the pillars that are making this continent safer, I fully agree, but as I said before, there are times when politics trumps economics. When a nation sees national interest as predominant and will pursue it regardless of the economic cost. This has been seen time and time again, and I think it would be foolish of us to think it might not happen again. I gave an example with Taiwan and potential ones that could arise in Europe. 

On the other hand, the US military hegemony over its allies on this continent eliminates the prospect of war. Completely. That military hegemony of the US, through structures they created like NATO, completely ends it. It ends it because the threat of American power is enough to deter any escalation before it arises. You can't risk raising tensions because the US would not allow it, and they are too powerful to ignore. This is where I think we disagree.


&gt; This leaves external forces such as Russia. Apart from its nuclear weapons, Russia is much weaker than in the days of the cold war, and doesn't represent a significant military threat. The bigger risk is Europe's energy dependence on Russia. 

Russia is not a threat to the United States.  However this is not the case for France, UK, Germany or Italy (the only potential powers in Europe). Those countries are fully capable of defending themselves from Russia, and even defending their close neighbours. But can we do it in Russia's backyard? In the baltic states? That was the reason for Estonia as my example. Without the US that would be done with incredible difficulty. There military can be scoffed at by the US but I dont believe it can be by the UK or France. It's not a threat to us in far Western Europe because they cant project that far, but they are to our other European allies. We saw with Libya how limited the two strongest European militaries are. Would other European nations be ready to risk blood in potential conflicts? I really doubt it. 

This is also not taking into account nations on the periphery, like Turkey, who have a strong and capable military. If they eventually decide to take cyprus again (and thus dekalia) we would be at war. They won't right now because the US would stop them. The last time they invaded in 74, we had plans to counter-invade and push them out but the US put a stop to our plan.  

This unbalanced multipolarity is what is ramps up the prospect compared to the hegemonic dominance of the US. I say unbalanced because the UK and France have nuclear weapons, but Germany has the potential stronger military force that is currently benign but highly trained. Russia has a technologically inferior military but one that is large, especially on land. Peripheral powers like Sweden have the forces and military technology to swing any conflicts between nations. And nations around Europe, like Turkey, Israel, Egypt etc have capable militaries that can still pose threats without a US there to completely and utterly dissuade them. This leaves the whole security landscape unbalanced. 

The overall point is, once the US leaves we will be forced to provide for our own safety and the security landscape would change. It doesnt mean we cant safely deal with it, but that it is a more dangerous situation than one in which the ""American pacifier"" is in full effect. Hopefully we can use institutions like the EU to create a powerful military bloc of more than one nation, however the ceding of military authority/sovereignty would be a tough political decision for any nation.

1) Townsend was shite today. In fact, I haven't been impressed with him since the beginning of the season. Maybe it's because he was playing on the right, but I doubt it. His touch is too heavy, he comes inside when he should stay outside (and by doing so makes it more difficult for Soldado to utilize his space) and he takes too much time on the ball. 

2)Naughton was great today. Having him at RB as a backup is exquisite. If only he could play like that on the left. Great defender, and he was involved in a lot of good plays today. He fed Paulinho who fed Soldado a sitter on a silver platter, which brings me to my next point..

3)Soldado has no confidence in front of goal what so ever. He had some decent plays on the ball, fed Paulinho who got brought down for an almost penalty. However, we need quality in front of goal and the only player providing us with that right now is Ade. 

4)That was the worst defensive display I have seen from Spurs in a long time. 

5)When we play at home, I hope to god Townsend isn't even on the bench, let alone in the stadium. Maybe Soldado can sit on Kane's lap on the bench, but he's not far behind Townsend. ",0,1392926543,null,0,false,0,cfkdngk,t3_1yguao,t1_cfkdngk,t3_1yguao,null,1432484851,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Maybe the JSA claimants can claim it as their money either way, because they're the ones buying the goods and services, making work for the taxpayers who then get paid for it and then taxed.

I dunno. The economy is one great big cycle. It's not a sewer, where the shit falls to the bottom, leaving the top clean and sparkly.

If I got nearly half of my decisions wrong at work, I don't think I would be paid for that. I don't think I'd still be there.

During the time of the appeal, the claimant gets a lower rate of benefit. In theory this gets backdated when you win your appeal, but without interest payments. In practice you have to chase this up with DWP who will do their best to delay and reduce the amount.

Appealing is not straightforward and many claimants especially those with mental health issues don't appeal even when they could easily win.

&gt;Do you honestly think that you or Salmond have a better idea of the views of every single European leader than do the people who work with them on a daily basis in running the organisation that Scotland will be seeking to join?

I would say neither van Rompuy or Barroso are talking on behalf of their respective organisations. Barroso said as much on Sunday and van Rompuy said the same as the opening remark of his December Catalan speech.

It doesn't matter a jot what they say as the decisions will be made on a legal basis and the legal basis has not been tested nor tried before. I would also ask if there is any country that has made noises about denying Scotland a place in the EU? I know people keep hinting that Spain would, but they have said they will not interfere.

Regarding the process Scotland would need to take to gain entry to the EU, there are a number of respected people who take the same view as Scotland - [Former director general of the European Commission Jim Currie told MSPs he did not foresee any EU member state blocking an independent Scotland's membership](http://www.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/scotland-26265755) and he also said ""[We're dealing with people who would have certain rights as EU citizens and which would be very difficult to take away, and nobody would want to](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26278237)"" or [Professor Sir David Edward, a former European Court judge](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-20757450) or [An adviser to the German government has said he believes Scotland would remain part of the European Union in the event of a vote for independence](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/adviser-to-german-government-indy-scotland-would-still-be-in-europe.20948699) or this view from the [former Chief of Staff of the French Minister for European Affairs and current member of the Conseil d’État, Yves Gounin](http://www.catalannewsagency.com/politics/item/french-study-backs-eu-membership-of-independent-catalonia-and-scotland).

I've never taken any classes, so I don't really know what I'm doing, or at least can't describe it in any proper technical detail, but I just set up my colours, and then pick colours more or less at random, switching when the brush runs out, definitely not focusing on one area too long (as you might be able to see in the time lapse photos or the gif provided by /u/sloppygif) I try to put paint where there is least paint. I don't look at the picture at all, it can get disheartening to see how far a work in progress is from the source photo, instead I just look at everything as areas of colour, and focus only on where I can add more colour to make my mess of colour look more like the mess of colour I'm copying. Staying in one area too long makes me get all tied up trying to make it look like the photo, when I should be moving around the picture safe in the knowledge that that area will look how I want it to in a couple of hours. To make everything the right proportions, I use a method for cheating at spot the difference pictures, where you tape one picture down the side of the other, then lift and lower it rapidly like a 2 page flip book, making the differences flash on and off. I guess I go from general to specific, because start with big strokes of bold colour that are just the background colour of whatever area I end up in small strokes in the most detailed areas.

Back in the cold war, people worried about a Soviet salami-slicing strategy where Warsaw Pact  forces would engage a series of limited incursions on the periphery of Europe and on the West German border. 

As any conventional conflict could escalate into a nuclear exchange, the question was ""would the US be politically able to risk New York and Washington for Schweinfurt? How about Würzburg?"" and so on till Warsaw Pact elements were at the Channel coast. 

To make this strategy more difficult for the Soviet Union, the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment was parked on the southern part of the West German border. This made it impossible for Warsaw Pact units to get very far across the border without annihilating a US unit, which would definitely demand a response.

As far as I'm aware there's no equivalent US presence today in Estonia. The nearest assets are two doors down in Lithuania. Would the US risk taking casualties for Estonia? There's only one way to find out.

NATO exercise Steadfast Jazz 2013 was intended to reassure Poland and the Baltic states of NATO’s commitment to their territorial defence. Non NATO members Finland, Sweden and Ukraine took part as members of the NATO Response Force. On the other hand US participation was minimal. It looks as if Europe is already adapting to a much smaller commitment from the US.

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"What's happened here is that Osborne (and co) has been beaten, in this instance, at the game of *Scottish politics*. Osborne took a clear opposition stance on a key issue, he did it months before a vote has taken place and he did it purposefully to unsettle the ground. For better or for worse, the Scottish population generally doesn't react well to that. It was never really about currency union, it was about solidifying a perception of the people who run the NO campaign and the country.

This independence issue was Westminsters chance to heal wounds if you like, they didn't have to play the *""It'll be shit alone""* game they could have quite easily just talked up the qualities of the union, talked up the qualities of Scotland and capitalised on union feel good stuff like the Olympics. Keep it light, promise to try harder to address some of the issues the Scots care about, don't get into a shit slinging match and then just let inertia protect the status quo.

Which is exactly what they were doing for a long time and Salmond didn't really have much of an answer to it because he too is *generally* playing the nice guy, he wants to be the guy to bring compromise to the table. To make the case for change he has to point out where the union is failing Scotland but he'd never get anywhere if he just starting sending out flyers with *""Tories, cunts eh?""* in bold type.

I'm not about to say that Salmond has some master plan or any of that shite but one thing is true, he knows Scottish politics and knows that what he needs to push the YES vote over the edge (potentially) is an uncompromising enemy he can position as someone who doesn't care about Scotland.

If doesn't have that he's just a man in a room shouting about how great Scotland is. Well done mate, nobody really said anything to the contrary but you have fun.. teacakes? Aye brilliant them.

Which is *exactly* what Osborne gave him when he made that speech. It was a uTurn, all the nicey-nice better together stuff faded away as he stood there informing us all that *x, y &amp; z* had already been decided, he will not negotiate and that if we vote YES we'll have to fuck off and try something else because he's not listening.

You can call it resentment, call it axe-grinding, call it petty, call it misinformed.. hell you can call it Scrooge McDucks great tartan mental retardation for all I care but there *does exist* a sentiment that given the opportunity Westminster will fuck us as hard as they can and it's honestly surprising to see rUK/Tories/Osborne thinking that the uncertainty created by their announcement will overrule the sentiment.

*(Sidenote. Before anyone says it.. it's not an anti-english sentiment. I'm sure there are cunts who feel that way but for the most part it's the same, but amplified, sentiment that a lot of the north of England has. Of not being represented. It's decades old this shit and covers thousands of issues.)*

Absolutely rUK has every right in the world to take a position on these issues and absolutely they should reject a currency union if that's not good for its citizens. However making a speech about it personifies it, it gives Salmond someone to point and say *""There, that is a man who will not negotiate and does not have your best interests in mind. Do you want to continue with that man in charge? No? Well tough because in the UK your votes barely matter.*""

It doesn't matter that every politician on this earth would do the same thing and immediately abandon any efforts of pleasing a group of people who just split off...he didn't have to come out and actually say it. NO was always leading the polls, always painted Salmond as the disruptive minority, always dismissed the issues, always took the position of ""*Let's see if he actually gets the vote first*"". Then suddenly a strong position in direct opposition to Salmond. Why then? Why currency union? Where's all the decisions on all the other issues? We can only assume it was done purely as a spanner throwing exercise. 

-----

Like I said, it's the game of Scottish politics. Salmond had already convinced a lot of people that it wasn't going to be easy, that we wouldn't get everything we wanted. People on all sides were prepared for reality being different than what we hoped so with the spanner hurled the reaction isn't *""Oooh what are we going to do? That was crucial to success! Noooooo""*. Instead it's more *""Oh? Ok well that sucks it'd been nice to at least talk about it, no need to be such a cunt about it.*""

1. Greizman would cost £25m+
2. We already own a certain % of right to Markovic, and he is essentially only on loan to Benfica.
3. Lucas Ocampos... I guarantee you've never watched him play a full game.
4. James Rodriguez would cost £20m+.
5. Viktor Fischer is 19 and probably on the same level as Piazon, which means he can't contribute to our first team as a squad member. Plus he needs to play regularly.
6. We tried signing Bruma but he chose Glatasaray instead, plus he just sustained a long term injury which will keep him out for the season, so good riddance.

And just because the assessors are paid less doesn't mean that these savings are passed by ATOS to the taxpayer. In 2011/12 ATOS was paid £112.4m to carry out 738,000 assessments. That's over £150 per assessment. A GP costs £185 per hour of patient contact, and a GP appointment costs £36. (These are total costs including premises, equipment, and support staff.) So I doubt if using GPs would cost more than ATOS.

As for the relationship, GPs were used up until the ""Personal Capability Assessment""  introduced by New Labour. GPs have called for the Work Capability Assessment to be scrapped. ",0,1392931684,null,0,false,0,cfkgas6,t3_1yfirb,t1_cfkgas6,t1_cfkffqc,null,1432486167,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
