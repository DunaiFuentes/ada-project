Now we've got the trading-of-insults out of the way, let's get down to the science.

Fire is the name we give the process of the rapid, energetic oxidisation of a combustible material exposed to heat or an ignition source in an oxygen-bearing atmosphere. If there's nothing to oxidise, there's no fire. Oxidisation is the name given to the process whereby the atoms of the fuel material combine with oxygen atoms and release energy as heat. For example, if you ignite coal, most of the carbon atoms combine with oxygen atoms (two oxygen atoms per carbon atom, because chemistry) to release carbon dioxide along with a whole bunch of heat and light.

Oxygen is already oxygen...it can't oxidise any further, no matter how hot you make it. If oxygen could burn, the act of striking a match would set the sky on fire. 

Adding more oxygen will indeed make more things flammable than would be with our current atmospheric mix (which, venturing back on topic for a moment, wouldn't protect us on the ground from fire in the sky, but would make everything on the planet much more likely to burst into flame when exposed to an ignition source), but I stand by my statement that oxygen doesn't burn.

Of course, all of this is irrelevant because coronal mass ejections aren't fire, they're charged particles. You'd need a stonking great magnetic field to protect us from those. The story might have been more accurate if the trees were made of iron. It still wouldn't have been believable, but it would have been *slightly* more accurate than the concept of saturating the atmosphere with oxygen to protect us from magic space fire.

A better equivalent would be a black man who says segregation is good and black people are too uppity, or a woman who says a woman's place is in the kitchen and subservient to man, or don't deserve the vote. Does this sound ridiculous? It should and it is, but it *happened* and it still happens. There are many examples throughout history and the OP is just another grain of sand in a desert, I don't see how this could even be argued when it's so common. 

Read what he's saying. Who does he sound like? A gay person on this thread used the phrase ""rainbow brigade"" - who do they sound like? Who uses sound bytes like that? 

If they didn't pre-face it with ""I'm gay and"" they'd sound just like a casual homophobe, and whereas heterosexuals who repeat these sound bytes are downvoted in this thread, gay people know they'll be rewarded

Who do these ""good gays"" sound like when they complain about how gay pride is too much and flamboyant gays are annoying and gay PDA is going too far? Where did they learn phrases like ""flamboyant"" or ""shoving it down people's throat"" or ""special treatment"" or ""rainbow brigade""? The proof is staring you in the face. They're sock puppets reading from a script which sounds a lot like the big book of anti-gay arguments 

It's virtually universal though it can vary in intensity from person to person and everyone is different. Some never suffer it, others are slaves to it for life. When your gay friend says they hate flamboyant gays and gay pride, you can't actually trust that it's their genuine opinion since they are so heavily influence by others and have a vested interest in emulating majority opinion for their own security   


These things aren't uncommon, they happened and they happen. That's why you can't trust minorities to speak out for their own rights, because more often than not they are conditioned to parrot the majority opinion as a defence mechanism and hold themselves back because the majority opinion is usually one which is holding them back 

Internalised homophobia is real. I experienced it, and I probably still experience it to some degree. You expect people to shake off 18 years of the closet and a lifetime of mental torture? Not gonna happen! I was like this guy in my teens to some extent, and I was like the gays in the comments here. We are raised in the same society as you, we are told the same things you are, we pick up prejudices no different to you. We get the same education, the same upbringing, we internalise everything you do and magnify it ten fold. 

We hinge our lives on acceptance and have a perpetual fear of marginalisation, rejection, discrimination or violence so we parrot the majority opinion and toe the party line and distance ourselves from the ""trouble makers"" in order to survive. We make it clear we know our place and won't cause any trouble so we can absolve ourselves of the fear of suffering the same fate as those who don't know their place or we throw others under the bus to save ourselves. 

We become invisible and silent and cultivate an environment where being invisible and silent is rewarded and held up as the epitome of self respect, security and dignity. We are told to ""turn the other cheek"") is divine. We are told the present is perfect and a gift to be grateful for simply because the past was worse 

The fact this sub doesn't even think internalised homophobia or internalised oppression is a thing speak volumes about how much they understand about the experience of minorities and how much they actually care about improving things and their responsibilities. But hey, at least you guys are all for equality even though you only upvote gay people who emulate your opinion on gay pride or homophobia or feminine behaviour and downvote those who don't

That equivalent you used is also very strange to me and totally off. I can tell you internalised homophobia is real because I suffered it every second of every day for over a decade before I replenished my self esteem, education and understanding to a level that allowed me to recognise it and break out of it

Even on this thread I feel the pressure and the guilt to be a good gay who says everything people want them to say instead of how it really is. There's a pressure to toe the party line and say what people want you to say and reflect their opinions to please them. The pressure never stops, you either resist or you don't. Most don't

Similarly driving into London to alleviate boredom will cost a fortune because parking is hellishly expensive.

If I were you I would consider getting shared ownership; put down a hefty cash deposit, rent the other 50 or so % at a subsidised rental rate, and look for a much more reasonable area with more going on in it. If you have excess cash hanging around, you can rapidly buy the other 50% in chunks and quickly become a full home owner through this route instead.

September 1914:

&gt; The call for volunteers was very positive, and so many men were going or thinking of going that John Aylmer and myself at the office felt we should also. We went to the headquarters of the Hon Art Corps in Finsbury Pavement, but found they were full up.

&gt; However, we saw an advertisement in Victoria St for an Old Public School and University Corps to form part of the New (Kitchener's) Army and went to enter our names on 2nd September. Preliminary drills were done in Hyde Park. Great fun as no-one knew much about drill.

18 September 1914:

&gt; On Friday 18th September, we assembled in Hyde Park with kit bags and were marched in sections to Victoria Station, where we entrained for Epsom Downs Station.

&gt; Epsom market square was a sight when 2500 of us got there waited to be billeted. The first night, I was with three others at a place just behind the parish church. The next day, we went to Woodcote Park and Major Henderson picked out the men he liked for the first battalion. I did not get in the first and was very thankful afterwards as we had a splendid colonel in the 2nd.

(This later became the 19th Royal Fusiliers.)

&gt; After this sorting out, we were marched back to Epsom to be re-billeted, much to the surprise of our one-night hosts. I was moved down to a road in the lower part of Epsom and had to share a bed with a man I did not know from Adam. However, as the people moved from the house after a week, I moved to 11 Hook Road to friends of theirs, the Cooks, where I was alone.

And from November 1914:

&gt; We had a very wet winter and trained on the Downs, Headley and Walton Heath. Still, I found myself getting fitter and fitter. In November, our company commander picked out four men with glasses and sent us to get what he called medical instruction. I was one of the four and rather disgusted when I found out it was a course for regimental stretcher-bearers. However, I did not regret it afterwards as it meant special privileges, no guards and few fatigues.

It's not a day-by-day thing, as my great grandfather transcribed it in the 1920s from the handwritten diaries into a more cohesive narrative - one with the boring, and I dare say, more personal or embarrassing bits taken out. My aunt found it about 10 years ago and typed it up, adding in information about the places and units and so on he wrote about from Wikipedia, as well as photos she could find online. To my knowledge, tehre are 5 copies: the one I have (my mother's copy), two copies for my two aunts, and two for my mum's cousins.

Just out of interest do you know what the Green's policy is on Cannabis legalisation? I tried googling it but I just found a page full of bumpf that I could not be doing with (http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/du.html).    

The other issue is the way you implement the law. Obviously the second reason to legalise cannabis is to get rid of the criminality and criminal gangs that run the current unregulated market. (the first reason is juicy tax dollars.)  In places like Colorado there is a much easier narrative where you say legalisation is getting rid of the Mexican gangs importing it into the states. In the UK Cannabis is often grown in grow houses in this country. Will the Lib Dem policy be able to get rid of this problem, or will it just legitimise it? In my view, Coloradan model is the one to adopt, the Duch/Amsterdam model is too old fashioned; having decriminalised end use sale but then illegal growing and everything else is absolutely mad.

Yes it is. He isn't just criticising it with a balanced discussion, he is actively oppressing, through negative and disparaging commentary, who someone is.  And whilst you say ""parading"" a lot would say ""embracing"" and ""expressing"", especially in a society that until recently, it was still looked down upon to be gay. They are no more ""parading"" their sexuality than goth  are ""parading"" their sub-culture around by the way they dress or behave.

&gt; No one is denied the right to marry, they are only denied the right to marry certain people (and even then only because marriage is a religious ceremony and the church defines marriage as between a man and woman). Personally I'd prefer to see a nominated spouse or equivalent for legal and tax purposes that would allow anyone to be given partner status, including family members.

&gt; You're still denying them something. And that creates inequality and thus the perception that this group is lesser because of who they are. It doesn't matter how often you repeat the ""man + woman"" line. It's complete bull.  Marriage predates Christianity and as someone else mentioned in this thread, we don't deny atheist the right to married for the lack of belief in God.  I'd have thought the Church would have more of a problem with than than 2 people that are believers getting married.  And why bring up legal and tax purposes?

&gt; That says more about how you view the ""Anti's"" than how they view gay marriage and you probably won't like what that says about your prejudice in relation to theirs. Besides, you opened the door to that legitimate critique when you start questioning the previously settled idea of who should be allowed to marry. And for legal and tax purposes, why shouldn't a minor or a family member be named? Pretending that these issues aren't relevant and pertinent reveals your own lack of understanding of the issue you are debating.

May it does show prejudices. But only because when ever I see anti-gay marriage argued incest and paedophilla always follow close behind, implying that homosexuality is to be viewed in the same way as these 2.  And the issues are only relevant for legal and tax purposes, but that *isn't* why people get married.  Not always anyway. If that's your only concern then lets drop the title of marriage all together, religious or other way and everyone just have civil partnerships.

Also, if your going to argue a point, at least explain *why*. You say these issues are connected then just leave it at that.

&gt; Views that have served societies successfully for thousands of years? And changing them in the span of less than a generation without questioning the pros and cons of doing so is an intrinsic good? Society may have moved on, that doesn't make it morally the only justifiable option any more than Communism or Fascism were morally justifiable because society had moved on.

HA! Successfully. In that case lets revoke women the right to vote, re-instate slavery, persecute non-believers and send kids back down the mines.  Society is constantly changing for the better. Constantly redressing and rebalancing what is right and wrong.  For centuries we have oppressed anyone that is remotely different to us, and now we are correcting that. The quicker the better too.  These things aren't less than a generation, it's centuries of anger and hatred towards these groups being turned around, admitting fault and moving on.  How can you possibly believe there are any cons to a society building itself on a bedrock of equality and fairness to all it's citizens?

&gt; If they want to have a religious ceremony that brings together a man and woman for the purposes of forming a family together, then obviously yes. If they just want to live together with someone and have legal protections against separation and tax law, then no. It really isn't a difficult concept to grasp so I don't know why you keep throwing up these straw men.

Again with the religious bull.  I am very accepting of religion in all it's forms, up and to the point it starts to discriminate against anyone. Using ""belief"" to hide behind bigotry may have worked in the past but it's not something anyone can do anymore.  If we allow religions opinion to rule how society is structure or how we treat people, then we can't criticise other religions that practise much harsher injustices.

&gt; Glad we are in agreement that we should be differentiating. The two things are different, after all.

That was a typo on my part, we shouldn't be differentiating. Man+ Woman, Man+Man, Woman+Woman, makes no difference. It's 2 humans that love each other and want to express that through marriage.

&gt; They are not disparaging remarks about the homosexual community though, they are disparaging remarks about certain members of the homosexual community who are more interested in offending those with religious sensibilities than in achieving equal rights.

The problem is, it fuels the stereotype that all homosexual people are ""Queens"" or ""Village People Types"" and those remarks will affect the whole of the community. Regardless, they are disparaging remarks for no other reason than how a person chooses to express themselves, it shouldn't matter any more than that.

&gt; I hope the irony isn't lost on you that the people he was calling out are the ones attempting to bully others into accepting their views on what equality is and isn't?

No irony at all. You don't have to accept the view, just acknowledge there shouldn't be any road blocks to creating an equal society. After all, what the hell does it matter to you if 2 men get married or not. It doesn't affect you in the slightest.

&gt; I'm with Voltaire on free speech and think that all hate speech laws are morally unjustifiable. I'd rather that people be offended by what is said than that people not be allowed to say something because others find it offensive.

I have the Voltaire quote tattooed on my back as it goes.  But society is a lot more fragile and complicated than to have straight black and white, yes or no answers to everything.  Hate speech laws are in no way morally unjustifiable.  Anything that prevents the prosecution of a group of people is wholly just.  No-one is preventing anyone for forming discussion or having criticism, it's more to do with the way those conversation are handled.  To dehumanise by throwing derogatory remarks around creates negative atmosphere and ultimately leads to sections of society from being excluded, seen as outsides, something to be feared or attacked.

It's not to do with who finds what offensive, it's about creating a balance between a persons right to free speech and a persons right to feel safe and secure and not be attacked for who or what they are.  Free speech is only there to protect us from Government persecution, to prevent tyranny forming by making protest and criticism against Government illegal etc. And it stops at the point it actually can actually case harm.  Like inciting violence or terrorism, or inciting bigotry and hatred that can very quickly exploding into a bashing parade of groups that are seen as having a lower social status. 

As with all these things having certain limits are about redressing the balance of society to make it more equal.  We sometimes have to place restriction on people to prevent harm, or to give opportunity to those that may not have it.  Disabled parking spaces are a prime example. You're not allowed to park right outside the shop so that a disabled person is afforded the access they need, thus redressing the inequality between those that can walk unaided and those that can't.

What worries me more is that you want to have the freedom to be a bigot. For people to be able to say what ever they want to who ever they want and sod the consequences.  That's how unequal and unjust societies are produced by creating negative and dehumanising atmospheres around people whether that be because of age, sex, sexuality, ethnicity etc.

Edit: further thought, your ok deny people who they marry, but not ok denying people certain ways of speaking. One is denying people the choice to marry the person they love, the other denying people the choice to be racist and bigoted. Deny Love, Embrace Hate.

I'm concerned by a couple of things though; (this might just be because I've a bad habit of worrying) my team is very small, just my line manager and one other person.

Also, what with government cuts, my line manager seems very concerned about proving our team's worth (both in the financial sense, and performance wise) to the powers that be, and he appears to believe we're a likely target for ""reorganisation"" , so I feel like the pressure is really on already.

false,steampunkunicorn,null,null,"I would advise that you don't let them in, at all, no matter how persuasive they get. They'll threaten court action and everything, but you can safely ignore them.

You only need a TV licence if you watch or record live TV *as it's being broadcast*. You can watch bought or rented films and even catch-up TV all you like without one.

The onus is on them to prove that you are watching TV without a licence. If you're not doing that, then you have nothing to worry about and you have no reason to let them in.

If you let them in, they will try their best to either catch you out (even having a TV that's tuned to receive live TV can be enough to get a court appearance, apparently) and/or they will try to sell you a licence you don't need, possibly by using misinformation to convince you that you need one. The reason they do this is that they're paid on commission - they get a cut for every licence they sell, or every conviction they help secure.

The only time you have to let them in is if they have a warrant - although in order to get one of those they have to have good reason to suspect that you are breaking the law, which is going to be difficult for them to do if you're not breaking the law.

false,Firmicutes,cnty-expat,liverpool,"In the Judeo-Christian tradition, which I assume you are referring to when you say the ""dawn of civilisation"", the meaning of marriage is certainly not as dogmatic or axiomatic as you like to make it seem. Historically marriage has had many other functions besides rearing children, such as status, building social bonds, avoiding shame, securing property. But those have ebbed and flowed with the ages and as people and their views evolved. Plenty of theologians too have amended their views on what the purpose of marriage is. St. John Chrysostom says: 'When there is no child, will they no longer be two? Most certainly, for their coming together has this effect, it diffuses and commingles the bodies of both. Paul Evdokimov writes, ""Both the preservation of the species and selfish sexual pleasure reduce the partner to a mere tool and destroy his dignity. Love alone bestows a spiritual meaning upon marriage. Marriage is the intimate union of two lives, the sacrament of love."" Love is most important factor in marriage, and not the the capacity to produce offspring.

So, in this age, why should we concern ourselves with what people centuries ago believed to be the ""purpose"" of marriage since our society is so different from theirs? You are making an appeal to tradition here but just because you personally believe the purpose to be a tradition dating back thousands of years, does not make it a cogent argument for the rest of us.

But let's go back to your argument about procreation. There are gay couples who do manage to procreate, whether by artificial insemination, surrogacy, etc., thus fulfilling the ""requirement"" of marriage. If they choose to get married, wouldn't it be unfair to just call it a ""civil union"" instead of a marriage. As for the rest of your comment, I'm not inclined to respond to it because you are making some extraordinary claims without backing it up.

Do we randomly wear the same mascara or something? Loreal Paris False Lash Flutter Mascara? That's an unusual coincidence!

I haven't ever tried removing moisture from them because I put my eyeshadow and powder on first so they get a little coated from that but I'll check it out. 

I feel like the mascara I use isn't necessarily the best for problems with outer lashes because the brush is not solid enough. I used to use things like Colossal mascara which kind of helped to force the eyelashes into submission.

I mean Browning is very lucky with Seamus' injury and Hibbo having to come off in the second halves. He'll be made into a centre back I bet because realistically he's not getting in front of Seamus and he'll be waiting for a good 5-6 years minimum for Seamus to be naturally phased out.

With our midfielders the only one I could probably see is Ledson. Supposedly class and England u17 captain I think. He'll slot in in a couple years when Barry has retired and Gibbo will probably be in an Osman style position with it up to Ledson and Besic to fight for it. 

Our strikers with the acception of Henen won't make it and I'd say that's almost fact. The lads that are there now are coming up on 20-21 and they still don't have a hope (pardon the slight pun) of getting near the first team. Just not gonna happen I'm afraid.

I'm not sure if you're referring to jack from Will and Grace, but if you are, I would say that having someone as flamboyant and camp as jack was a great edition to gay characters in media, because it slowly allowed prominent gay representation in TV; as what /u/Zenigata said. He was also a good contrast to Will who was a much less camp than Jack, and he was simply for love; will is in many ways very similar to the average straight guy.

false,ttamimi,blue,"""Farmer Hat"" Guy","The biggest question - ""Will I be able to find a job"" is very very hard to answer.

Here are some pointers though:

- Try and not say ""I have no experience"". Chances are, you have lots of experience and lots of skills, you just need to learn how to sell yourself.

- There are lots of vacancies in Bristol - The problem isn't lack of jobs, the problem is too many applicants. It's very competitive. Again, as long as you know how to sell yourself well, especially in an interview situation, you'll be fine.

- Example jobs include retail, bar work, part time agency, office admin.

- Transport is not an issue in Bristol. We moan about the bus companies being shit, and they are, but in relative terms, you can get anywhere quite efficiently using public transport. Also, Bristol is extremely cyclist-friendly. I don't have a car either. Most people around here don't to be honest...

- Areas to rent - Well this boils down to money. Here's a quick highlight of a few key areas in Bristol:

-- Town: Brilliant but you can't afford it.

-- Clifton: Brilliant but you can't afford it. (No one can)

-- Gloucester Road: Brilliant place. You can find a shared flat here quite easily. It's full of students and independent shops/pubs. This is probably ideal for you.

-- Filton &amp; Horfield: Same as above. Filton is more industrial and mildly further away from the centre, but still a bus-ride away.

-- Patchway: This is even further up north, but still commutable to the centre. Given the choice, Patchway wouldn't be my number 1 area. It's dull.

-- Bradley Stoke: Same as Patchway but newer. Mostly family homes up there.

-- Frenchay/Stapleton: Lots of UWE students and old people. Not a bad area. Quite nice if you prefer a quiet spot.

-- Fishponds, Eastville and Staple Hill: Just alright. Somewhat cheaper to live in so good if you're on a budget.

-- Easton and St. Pauls: Not as bad as people think they are, but still avoid if possible.

-- Stokes Croft: ~~Where I go to get drugs.~~ Not that bad, but very bohemian.

-- Bedminster: Just south of the centre. Cheaper to live in and only a short bus ride/cycle away. Another ideal destination if you're living on a budget.

-- Kingswood: Meh.

-- Knowle &amp; Brislington: No, thank you.

There's too many variables involved for any one design to be quiet for everyone; what bike you're riding (and so where most of the air is hitting you), what angle your head is at when you ride, how well the helmet fits and so on.

That said, in general you want to avoid designs that have vents that stick out, or other extraneous parts. Big, protruding vents will scoop up more air and make more noise, and even if they're shut you'll get more turbulence. That means they'll do a better job at keeping you cool when open, but it'll be louder.

And the other thing that's been said too often: Rather than stressing too much about a quiet helmet, get ear plugs and get used to riding with them in. Your long-term hearing will suffer otherwise.

TL;DR: Earplugs. Also [this](http://www.sportsbikeshop.co.uk/motorcycle_parts/content_prod/108833) helmet has served me well.

I should have also asked if it would be possible to apply and find a job outside the city? I won't have any money to live off that I could use whilst searching for a job so ideally would need to find a job first and then move to Bristol.

I've been to Bristol a few times and noticed how cyclist friendly it was. I prefer cycling and walking to driving anywhere so it sounds ideal.

Gloucester road sounds ideal for me. I will have a look at the area tomorrow. I looked stokes croft earlier today, seems somewhat similar to the area I live in here so its also somewhere I would consider.

Manquillo Toure Lovren Johnson

Lambert

But obviously things happen during the game, and in possession we played a little differently and it was quite interesting (though I saw no discussion of it on here).

Manquillo pushed very far forward because Borini pushed high up and came inside, where he likes to be, making runs behind the left center back and providing support to Lambert. He is naturally a goalscorer so he will make that movement, although his best moment of the game came from him staying out wide and putting a cross in (which I think is really important for Balotelli).

Johnson, unusually, stayed very deep. So at times it looked like we had a back 3, with Manquillo and Markovic (who was very reserved, down to tactics or his nerves I'm not sure) as wing backs of sorts.

false,Myoptical,null,null,"I read through the entire thing. I have to say, it was nice to see how people can debate counter points with great respect to each other (ignoring the minor quiffs and subtext)..

Summary: The debate was positive towards the legalisation and regulation of ""soft drugs"". But all parties were agreed on the notion that more research and information was needed before a final plan was decided. Everyone recognised that the drug act of 1971 was in need of a review, that prisons compound drug addictions rather than fix, and that the general public view the law (regarding drugs) and ministers as ""Dinosaurs"" when it comes to drug policy.

There was lament at how the main political party seems hesitant to comment, particularly when they had made positive comments towards review and legalisation in the past (RE:David Cameron).

Most agreed that Alcohol and Tobacco caused more damage than drug use. And that the current drug laws do not help the drug addicted, and simply ruin the lives of many.

Everyone recognised that the YouGov/Sun newspaper poll, which found 71% found the current drug laws out of date (~~please fact check this~~)([Source:You Gov](http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/577h6hxcig/SunResults_140303_Drugs_Website.pdf)), to be an indicator that ministers were far behind public opinion, and as such don't represent the public well in this debate. It was also noted, that when asked privately, many ministers agreed to end prohibition if their reputation were not involved. There was much distaste at this notion of chickenshit.

Anyway, there were a few good counter-points to legalisation. Mainly that not all legal countries have had positive results. It was counter augured that legalisation was resent and it takes time for results to show.


I hope this helps, it's an interesting read and it is simple disappointing that most of our ministers think this discussion is either trivial, or not worth talking about. Those that value their reputations by ignoring crucial issues should be voted out.

Personally I commend the following:

* Caroline Lucas (Brighton, Greens)
* Keith Vaz (Leicester, Lab)
* Mike Thornton (Eastliegh, Lib)
* Mike Hancock (Portsmouth, Ind)
* Dr Wollaston (Toatnes, Con)
* Peter Lilley (Hitchen and Harpaden, con)
* Paul Flynn (Newport West, Lab)
* Dr Julian Huppert (Cambridge, Lib)
* And the other speakers..

For holding an interesting and detailed discussion that bodes well for the health of country. It's such a shame that the attendance was poor..

Email - regularly. Write using snail mail regularly. Remember the cost of shipping and ship in advance. Mother's day is different - buy a card in May in the US to use in March the next year. I've also used UK websites to purchase gifts, to save on shipping/insurance.

You will get so busy with your new environment/culture/friends here that you may soon lose touch with ones back home. Bad idea!

Plan a visit - either your folks to come see you, or vice-versa, asap, even if it's a year out.

Figure out finances - money exchange.

Don't forget to do your visa stuff!

I moved with two suitcases - can't help you there I'm afraid. Consider the cost of shipping vs selling them and buying new.

Don't waste your remaining time in the UK. Plan out every day - make sure you get to do all the things you won't be able to do when you leave. It's hard to get time off work here for long periods, and when you do return to the UK, it'll take a day of traveling, so a week is too short.

That's really not true.  In many societies its origins have been entirely social, without religion being involved (ie. two people publicly pledging themselves to each other).  Eg. in ancient greece, it was purely a private arrangement between families, with no involvement of either the church or state.  Our earliest records are of similar public pledging approaches or purely legal arrangements (eg. the code of Hammurabi).

Of course religion has often got involved in many cultures, but ""always"" is definitely not true.  Indeed, it's sometimes surprisingly long before religion gets involved - for Christianity, it wasn't actually till the 9th Century that the church started getting involved in marriage at all, and not until the 12^th-13^th that we got anything like the modern marriage ceremony with a priest presiding over the wedding.

Indeed, you don't even need to look to history for this, just the post you replied to which mentions the fact that atheists get married today, in full accordance with the law and no religious involvement at all.  These instances are not a sacred act to any of those involved, yet they're fully recognised as marriage.

&gt;It just happens to be that the nation's been Christian for the last 2000 years.

History's not your strong point, I take it?  (Hint: this nation isn't even 2000 years old itself, and even if it was, Christianity didn't really get established here until the Romans, and it wasn't anything near being a ""Christian nation"" until at least the 9^th Century with Alfred.)

&gt;Did you think Christians would just let it go without a fight?

This ""fight"" was over with the Marriage Act of 1836.  Christianity *clearly* has no monopoly on marriage in this country, and I for one think this is a good thing.  People of all (or no) religion can get married with absolutely no involvement with Christianity.",0,1414720017,null,0,false,0,closaby,t3_2ksidu,t1_closaby,t1_cloee1x,null,1426263849,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The Doctor left Gallifrey for multiple reasons but was largely unhappy with Time Lord society and had an unquenchable wanderlust that was not really condoned.

Before meeting his first human companions he was a grumpy, devious, and somewhat inconsiderate older incarnation. He kidnapped his first companions, lied to them, and even risked their lives on their first off world adventure against the Daleks just because of his own curiosity.

Over the course of the first season of Classic Who he softened and warmed in the face of his human companions. They helped him to see the universe for more than just a source of knowledge. He started seeing the injustices of the universe through their eyes and in The Dalek Invasion of the Earth officially cemented his role as a monster fighter. He almost invariably picked up new human companions as he dropped off old ones and due to humanities spread over the universe he kept on bumping into them in the future elsewhere in the universe.

Eventually he was even stranded on Earth for a time which further cemented his relationship with humanity and due to his presence Earth became an even larger target than before from the universe (especially the Master and those he allied himself with). Even his Fourth incarnation visited Earth fairly often at the beginning.

And after the Time War, Earth essentially became his second home especially after Rose reignited his passion and curiosity. Despite their failings and flaws, he had come to respect them and their usually boundless curiosity and indomitable sense of exploration and survival.

David Tennant seemed to be of some interest to Dave (maybe Dave's young son has mentioned ""Doctor Who""?) Dave was also interested in Tennant's being Scottish.

And if the historical rivalry is one-sided it's because their entire original fanbase, the historical fans who have followed the team for generations, have been priced out, and can't afford to go to the games anymore. Stamford Bridge is tourists. No wonder they don't have a sense of rivalry.

What is surprising is that in the last decade that we have been in economic turmoil, no party has sensibly approached the subject as a way to free up extra collateral for the benefit of the country. $30million in US taxes raised by the state of Colorado from Cannabis alone, simply from when their policy was introduced is not a figure to be ignored lightly.

On the contrary, the problem here is when traditionalists attempt to impose their views on the general public, on people who do not ascribe to their traditional views. 

Negative unforeseen circumstances? Well, parts of the UK have had marriage equality for quite a while now, not to mention countries such as Canada, New Zealand, and parts of the US and society haven't collapsed, unless you want to count those weathers disasters that were caused by the homosexuals, according to that one UKIP bloke. 

Many religions have their own definition as to what constitutes a marriage but the State does not need to adhere to any one religion's view on what a marriage should be.

And lastly, why do we need to call it a different name if they are effectively the same? I prefer to call a spade a spade; a rose by any other name does not always smell as sweet.

As an island we've been isolated from many things the continent has experienced over the past centuries. The Spanish Inquisition, the Napoleonic wars, and then of course the 2 world wars. While we were obviously involved, the fighting didn't happen on our land. Our civilians didn't see the brutality of the fighting and what Hitler/Mussolini/Stalin did to their people. However continental europe did, and still bear the scars, and this is one of many reasons why we are fundamentally different. We don't have an insiders view. We're detached from them, which is great. But we will always be different and so we'll never fit in with them.

We also, in general, have different cultures. Much of continental Europe is Catholic. We of course are Protestant. The ancestry of many European nations is Slavic and Baltic, whereas the majority of British ancestry is Scandinavian. 

The languages are different. Our language is a mish-mash of French, German, Latin and various other influences but French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese are all relatively similar. 

For so many reasons, while we *are* European, we can never truly feel as European as someone born and living on the continent.

Sent my Samsung S4 back through O2 who sent it to Anovo. My s4 had suddenly stopped recognising the sim and the batt had started to swell. 

Anovo come back to me and say this is my fault and the warranty does not cover it, I phone them up and a lady who was completely unwilling to help or sympathise with my case said if I wanted it fixed I had to pay £65. Asked to speak to her supervisor and she refused. 

Really needing my phone back I paid the money, O2 were happy to pay half the price after I complained to them, woo! 

Day later I'm informed I'll be receiving a refurbished device, win again? Nope, a couple days later my original phone arrives, to the shock of the assistant at the O2 store, with damage under the back plate where they had over tightened screws and chipped away the edges, there were also a lot more scratches over the screen. 

So not only had I not been given a refurbed device as promised my original phone had come back even more damaged. 

Luckily the assistant at the O2 store realised something was up and is claiming damages for my phone against Anovo. Overall a shabby experience.

His stories feel like stories told by a 10-year-old, which I'll grant is definitely part of his charm.  But he's got little or no grasp on the *mechanics* of writing.  How to properly set up plot twists.  When to show and shoot ""Chekhov's Guns.""  When NOT to head into schmaltzville for needless melodrama.   

And I'm just goddamn sick of Moffat's stories *never making sense.*  

Doctor Who was often complex, but it was rarely incomprehensible.  At least previously.  But now, most people can't even *begin* to explain most of the biggest events that happened in the last few years.  And on top  of that, Eleven rebooted the Universe more times than all his predecessors combined, so it's not even entirely clear which parts of the last few seasons even *happened*.

Hell, we can't even manage to properly reconcile Day of the Doctor with End of Time in a way that makes much sense, and we're talking about two of the most important stories of Nu Who here.

Then, on top of the lazy writing and near-disregard for characterization over special effects, this season has apparently decided that they can simply disregard any laws of nature (or reason), at will, with the barest of handwaves.  Robin Hood's perfect teeth.  The Moon gaining mass from nowhere.  *Everything* about that last ep.
 
Plus, as others have noted, they've also started falling into the Five-era trap of having stories where the Doctor turns out to be largely irrelevant.

Like...  Who has become so disconnected from reality I can't even get involved in it these days.  It's just running and screaming and special effects until a magic wand is waved and Everything's OK Again.

1. Great experiences, great people, doing graphic design right now (2nd year) and I can tell you the staff are really pretty great. Wonderful facilities and everything too.

2. The area isn't really dangerous at all, just don't be a nonce and you'd be perfectly fine. Just like any other student city.


3. Standards.. I can't say outside of my area (graphic design - lucky that's what you're looking at I guess ;)) but the standards are pretty excellent - it's one of the best graphics unis in the country alongside Falmouth. Also there are LOTS of foreign students here, and really students from all over. No 'type' of person who comes here.

4. Unsure about this, but for graphics employers won't really care too much about where you're from.

5. Plenty of night life, pubs &amp; clubs all over the place

6. Campus is spread out a little bit but everything's within 10 minute walking distance from everything else.

7. The library is really very good, there are also woodworking and metalworking workshops, there's things like embroidery machines and laser cutters available to you as a graphics student too

8. Accommodation you can get pretty cheaply if you go for a house share (around £50/week) or you can get a flat for £78-110 per week. I was in Lawson Halls uni accommodation first year and it was fairly nice, £90 per week was kind of expensive but I enjoyed my stay there. Currently at a Sanctuary Students flat for £82 per week, way more reasonable.

9. Again, current student, can't really say other than in graphics it's your portfolio of work that matters more than any qualifications or anywhere you went to study

10. Unsure but I think all new students actually get free gym membership, check it out if you decide to come here. I've been meaning to look into it myself.

Bear in mind this isn't a current story **and** it doesn't relate to EU immigration...

In 2004 large numbers of Iraqi Kurds were allowed into the UK as asylum seekers.  Peterborough had a large Pakistani community since the seventies.  *(Around the Lincoln Road - Gladstone Street area.)*  While there wasn't much in the way of geographic integration they were settled and aside from being a poor area it was nice enough.  A significant number of Kurdish asylum seekers were poured into the area and there was a significant amount of violence that followed.

One of the few examples I can offer you is **[this](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-482816/Peterborough-A-city-crumbling-pressure-immigrants.html)**:    
&gt;In 2004 groups of Pakistani residents clashed with Afghan and Iraqi asylum-seekers in running street battles which saw cars
and houses set alight and windows smashed.    
&gt;Up to 200 youths went on the rampage and police officers from across the county were drafted in to separate the warring factions. A Kurdish refugee had his home firebombed and Lithuanian Dainius Kigas was murdered in nearby Wisbech.    
Obviously the Daily Mail isn't the most reputable of sources, but when nearly no one reports the news it's what you end up with.

**[Another](http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/local/community-time-to-put-end-to-racial-strife-1-150191)**:    
&gt;Violence between Kurdish Iraqis and Pakistani youths caused three nights of rioting in the Gladstone street area in May.    
&gt;Two men were taken to hospital after a gang went on the rampage with hammers and cricket bats, smashing up cars and breaking windows.    
&gt;In a second night of violence, hundreds of youths massed in Seargeant Street, pushing fire bombs through letter boxes and having a stand-off with police.

That same article includes this:    
&gt;Inspector Stephen Welby, from Peterborough police, said: ""There are cultural differences here, linked by religion, but most of the problems are not dissimilar to problems with groups of young males of any culture.""

If you don't live in Aleppo fire-bombing and ram-raiding aren't normal problems with groups of young males.  

By the end of September 2004 these was a constant police presence.  The ~~Kurdish immigrants~~ non-settled-Pakistani groups used to hang around in packs of fifteen to twenty.  To be fair they didn't do anything overtly threatening, but a large group of men hanging around is inherently threatening.  My girlfriend at the time was afraid to walk past them.  

We moved away.  Not because of that, but because I got another job.  But it surely didn't feel like a safe place to live anymore.",0,1414726663,null,0,false,0,clovl1g,t3_2krsie,t1_clovl1g,t1_clo3s8f,null,1426262274,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If I can buy from a shop, and never be arrested for it, why the hell not?

As things are, however, I only get the option of potentially impure product, from a shady bloke in an alley, paying over the odds for a defined amount that I might not take too kindly to. This is a big disincentive for me, but the biggest part is the potential for it to not be what I asked for. If it failed my test, I know plenty of people I could give it to. Shady characters... well some would have **me** as a shady character, so it's fairly ok to look past that. Price not really an issue. I'm not unfamiliar with street prices, so I know what to expect. However, I don't particularly want to be smoking anything that isn't 100% cannabis.

I also don't want any other cannabis smokers to be unwittingly smoking something that isn't cannabis either, and a well-regulated legal market would be the right direction to go for that.

When i was saying it might not get on too well with me... I have tried it on several occasions in the past, years and years ago now. Only got high once, but it wasn't the pleasant kind of high. It was the chained anxiety attacks and general feeling of malaise kind of high. I figured that if i buy any in future, I don't want to hold onto it very long (because it's illegal) but I also don't want to smoke a fat joint in a matter of seconds and end up taking a swift departure from chilledville and disappearing into a mental health melting pot (I have issues already. My suspicion is that last time I smoked up, I managed to aggravate those, as opposed to anything directly weed-related, especially since other people with similar issues have said weed is a major help with controlling them).

Going legal would remove possession guilt, allowing me to happily store any amount I buy and consume at leisure, therefore meaning I can just chill out and have as small an amount as I want.",0,1414726794,null,0,false,0,clovn51,t3_2ksoru,t1_clovn51,t3_2ksoru,null,1426262247,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As for the ""I give up on Humanity,"" I don't understand how anyone could get that from any episode. In fact, he's acting the exact opposite; he's trusting humanity enough to allow them to save themselves. Pink's speech about the Doctor turning humans into better people is no different that what he's done the entire show. Rory said the same thing when he first met the Doctor. The Daleks mentioned the same thing about him turning everyone into a warrior. Rose and Martha also mentioned how the Doctor helped them see a better way of living, which is exactly what the 12th Doctor has done.

When Courtney mentioned that she felt like she was nothing, the Doctor did the same thing he's done with every companion; she made her something. His plan was the first girl on the moon, but he actually ended up making her the savior of the alien who a lot of people wanted to kill. He did the same thing with Clara, and Pink mentioned how hard that can be on a person. He still seems to care very deeply for the human race.

I will admit that he insults humans all the time, but he does that to every race. An example was Madame Vastra, whom he said couldn't possibly understand the complexity of his mind right before she knocked him out. And this isn't even new. Martha and Rose talked about this in the episode with the Krillitanes.

If you have to describe a player like this they don't deserve to be at Chelsea. In order to compete with the European elites we need to have quality players all the way around.

Having someone that you say ""Eh, he isn't *that* bad"" just isn't good enough. He needs to show that he is more than just an Egyptian Aaron Lennon, other wise out the door he goes. We have much more promising players out on loan and even more that play for other teams that would kill for a chance to play on Chelsea.

If ever there was a time where Everton Football Club's history could be rewritten, it's now. New money from the TV deal came in, allowing us to invest in players like never before. The two champions league positions under man city and Chelsea are completely up in the air, europa league(and the CL birth one gets with it) is very much there for the taking, and the clubs around us haven't used their greater financial clout to pull away yet. If we can get champions league this year, and maybe hold the line next year, I could see a foreign investor buying us off of Mr. Kenwright. If we want to run with the big boys in modern football, this has to happen soon, while our window of oppurtunity is still open.

Regardless, exciting times to support Everton. ",0,1414730653,null,0,1414730873,0,clox5de,t3_2ku3m4,t1_clox5de,t3_2ku3m4,null,1426261472,7,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,7
false,darmani11,IQ,iraq,"I think Mikel is just ment to disrupt the play of the opposition. There becomes no attacking mid when he plays, with the highest point in the midfield being Fàbregas as a central role. Passing to the sides might be to encourage a counter attack from one of our wingers/fullbacks. 

Also, passing sideways is great for killing time, while tiring the opposition. The opposition must press in hopes of getting the ball. Even if the team was to get the ball, their is the DMs, and the backline to stop the attack. Mikel and Matić are already great at regaining position, so the counter should fail.

The other team are pressing now, they have no choice. Guess what? Fàbregas has quite a great eye for passes, and should be able to find our attackers now, in order to launch a counter. Hazard is great for this because even if he is unable to create a chance, he seldom loses the ball fairly. Costa is a good fit as well because he is able to hold up play, or score. Him and Hazard are great for this. 

The right wing becomes tricky. I believe Schürrle should be subbed on before Mikel. Schürrle likes to pester the defense with his runs, and is great to counter. Especially when he is fresh. On the counter, he would be perfect to complement the direct play that the team play when Mikel takes the place of Oscar. He can either bag another goal, or just tire the oppositions defense.

Is this a good tactic to be using against a team like utd? I think so. José thinks so. Why did we fail then?

I personally believe Mikel should be the last sub. 75' or later. Otherwise the other team will adapt, and eventually find space. We can't hope to close out the game as early as we tried against city and utd. He was subbed on at 67' vs utd, and 63' vs city. If we had held on a little later to blow full-time on the game, I think we would have held out. Especially vs City. 

Maybe this is a horrible analysis. I'm going to re-watch the Utd game later, and maybe the city game as well. And see if my theory is correct. ",0,1414730664,null,0,false,0,clox5ie,t3_2ktvm5,t1_clox5ie,t1_clorwpt,null,1426261471,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Putting aside the fact that he said he was older than 900 in the *classic series,* there's also the matters of aging. The War Doctor was a relatively youthful man when he regenerated, so if we use Trenzalore as a comparison, it was definitely a few centuries of fighting. 

Yet he states his age as 800 in the 50th. So by that logic he would have been between 400 and 500 when the 8th regenerated. But what about the 1st Doctor, who grew to be an old man? There's also a few centuries on him at least by the time we get to An Unearthly Child. But then under this logic the entirety of the Doctor's lives from the start of the series to the end of the 8th would be at most 200 years or so. 

That doesn't sound right. Also all of this is contradicted by everything the Doctor said about his age in the new series.

I have to say, **I am not concerned one bit about Liverpool FC.**

I think the magic of last season really set the bar of expectation very high this season. I think a lot of supporters thought we'd pick up right where we left off.

As for me, I came into the season thinking that without Luis Suarez and all the new players and the addition of the Champions League, we were going to have a hard time this season.

But I believe our team will gradually gel together, our attack will come good and even some marginal improvements on  defence will make all the difference.

And with all that...

* We'll finish 4th and get Champions League again.
* We'll get out of our CL group, crash out of the next stage, do OK in Europa.
* We'll go far in either the FA or League Cup (maybe even win one).

And that's that.

It's not a sexy way to look at it - especially in light of last season - but I view this season as a bit of a transitional season (getting used to new players, new schedule, etc.).

But it's *next* season where I will confidently make bold statements.

Think about it:

* Player-wise, we've positioned ourselves where we will eventually need just one or two more players (yes, and it will probably be that ""big-name, marquee"" player) to get us to the next level.
* All the players - and coaches - will have the experience of balancing Champions League and the Premier League under their belt.
* After the difficulties of this season, the entire club will be *hungry*.

And in the 2015-16 season, I believe we will finish in the top 3 of the league, we will reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League, we will reach the final of one or both of the domestic Cups. And if we get a bit of luck - and don't fool yourselves, in sport we need a bit of luck - we will win either the title or the Champions League and maybe even throw in a Cup as well.

I'm not about 'What have you done for me lately' or 'What will you do for me today.' I'm about what we are doing today to build dominance for tomorrow and for the next decade.

&gt;__The Serious Organized Crime and Police Act 2005__ (c.15) (often abbreviated to __SOCPA__) is an [Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament) of the [Parliament of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom) aimed primarily at creating the [Serious Organised Crime Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_Organised_Crime_Agency), it also significantly extended and simplified the powers of arrest of a [constable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Constable) and introduced restrictions on protests in the vicinity of the [Palace of Westminster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Westminster). It was introduced into the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_House_of_Commons) on 24 November 2004 and was passed by Parliament and given Royal Assent on 7 April 2005.

In the UK, most dealers are street-level, and with our coastline, it's easy enough to smuggle in supplies. No need for escalation there. Escalation happens between gangs seeking to control the street-level supply, which *mainly* impacts those gangs. However, the increase in power of the criminal gangs does affect everyone (just as under Prohibition). They also gain the power to move into extortion, pimping and so forth.

Our leaders are not deluded nor incompetent. They recognise the facts, but they also recognise that there still isn't a big enough majority to support change (they would lose votes). Also, being ""tough on crime"" is popular, and the easy target of drug users means that crime stats are slewed in their favour as long as people don't look at them too closely.

It will go the same way that Gay Marriage went: the Liberals will propose change (already done) and, as the popuation in general support it more and more, there will be a tipping point where it is viable for the other politicians to reverse policy: which they will do in the blink of an eye.

It all depends on which position gets more votes. Just because the young and the liberals support a policy doesn't change the views or the votes of the millions of older people.

What kind of ear plugs are you using? And how do you put them in?

I bought a Bell helmet from Amazon a few months back which turned out to be much (much) louder than my old MT Raptor. Having said that, with ear plugs even long motorway journeys are not a problem when I'm wearing ear plugs, with the caveat that they have to be the right ones, and they have to be put in properly.

I have made a few journeys where I didn't take my time putting in the plugs and the extra noise was bad enough that I had to stop at a service station to re adjust.

I have tried about 10 different types of plugs and there is a big difference between the best (for me) and the worst.

What I'm getting at is that even with a noisy helmet, I would expect a well fitted pair of ear plugs to reduce the noise enough for it not to be a concern.

So, are you sure you are using the right plugs for you? Do you use the proper technique and take your time to insert them? 

Both make a really big difference in effectiveness.

If you haven't already, I'd recommend purchasing a variety pack and trying out each of them.

""Well if we allow gay marriage then we'll end up allowing incest"" clearly a stance, (or as I had said, an implication) in opposition of both and based on disgust for those these things.

I would argue that there is actually a discussion to be had regarding incest. Whilst initially looked down upon because it would muddy the gene pool, these aren't necessarily things that we need to particularly worry about in a world inhabited by 7billion people.

The case in Germany recently, as an example illustrates the discussion, where 2 siblings separated at birth later fell in love, not realising they are related, has caused politicians to question whether in these circumstances they should be prosecuted under incest laws.

Of course we would have to consider the implications in that allowing relations between siblings. That it could inadvertently lead to young siblings engaging in sexual activity is a possibility, albeit a narrow one.  Would we argue that we don't allow any form of sibling relationships to prevent this, or do we say there are already laws regarding the age of consent and that these would suffice to create those boundaries needed to prevent it from happening.

But this is really an aside because it is far more complicated because these arguments involve the activities of children. SSM only involves the activities, and the inequalities created, by not allowing same sex adult couples to marry.

There's a subtle difference between the two. I'm not *offended* when a person uses the word ""cunt"", in the sense that I don't think the speaker has done anything morally wrong. 

However, I am definitely going to judge a person for their vocabulary choice. The word is known to be offensive. This is not because there's anything intrinsically wrong with it, but because it's linguistically and socially useful to have an arbitrary category of words that cause offence (""strong language""). The use of strong language in certain situations is effective and appropriate. It is when you use those words outside of those appropriate situations that problems occur.

The way you speak, like the way you dress, is a choice you make, an identification with a class. So I will attach certain associations to people who use the word ""cunt"" freely - low class, bad education, impolite, poor impulse control, lack of social awareness. Note this does not apply to all uses of the word ""cunt"". But that young man on the train yesterday, speaking loudly into his phone, peppering his conversation with fucks and cunts, while a family with small children sat across the aisle? Definitely judging him.

Not saying that you should be able to go into a shop and buy a g of heroin, I think that people should be monitored by their GP/drug services when it comes to their drug use. That would require a huge change in the way mental health is portrayed and funded in the UK because addiction is a symptom of some underlying cause most of the time.

I've been addicted to many things in the past and even though the legal system hasn't hurt me (directly) but the fact that these drugs are illegal and unregulated (also untested in many cases) possibly have. But from what I can see drugs are illegal because of many factors (hemp being better than paper ect), opium/heroin because certain agencies are making a killing turning the world into opiate addicts who (some, not all) turn to heroin to fund their on growing addiction.

The doc gave it to me, it must be okay right? Well if you manage to take it as prescribed with tolerence build-up MAYBE. Bigger chance of you becoming an addict with these drugs. Not a slum based addict with needles sticking out of his/her arm but more likely an athlete or worker who suffered an injury and slowly progressed onto harder opiates. BTW Afghan is 90% of the world producer of opium/heroin. What really was the goal in Afghanistan? Was it more dangerous then the people dying from lack of access to mental health services and the damage/violence created from creating this huge black market.

Legalise it(cannabis) - Have a model like the US states

Psychs - Legalise but I would undergo therapy pre-post ingestion if your unfamiliar.

Stimulants - We use this everyday in large amount in coffee or soft drinks. Crack/Meth would probably be the hardest to deal with. Cocaine is more social if taken responsibly.

Opiates - Provide pure opiates so users know what they are getting (not 100%) sure on the best way of keeping this drug away from some one with a big addiction issue.

The only way we can solve this issue is by using evidence based research and we've seen the way that the government reacts to that (ALA David Nutt). So governments go for the easy vote with the older who know only propaganda that has been served.

I don't know why anyone in their right mind would lock someone up for enjoying a drug of their choice (even better if the revenue was regulated, taxed
and fed into schools or healthcare). If they start stealing that's a criminal offence send them to jail (with a detox programme - remember jail is supposed to be rehabilitation). If their loony from being up on meth for 4 days then medical treatment may be in order.

Remember the argument - Think of the Kids. Let me tell you now it's MUCH easier for kids to get almost any illegal (and untested/unregulated) drugs they want. Much, much easier than alcohol. If the thought of drugs in free society strikes fear in you then you need to learn that these substances are not inherently dangerous and learn the risks and structures that support the current status quo of 'Drugs are bad mmmmkkkay'. Hopefully your kid wouldn't drink the bleach under the sink right?

One last point, in the UK there has been a growing number of private companies running prisons. I Don't want a country where men in power can make nonsensical laws and then jail you for them whilst they reap all the worlds resources for their own gain - Especially in the day and age of terror.

Education is the best way to solve this issue. Don't teach kids lies because when they grow up they think well X lied about Y so why not try Z. Stop spreading rumours and stop selling fucking dangerous RC's as classical drugs (NBOME, harmful) as LSD(I dare you to try and kill yourself with this, just try it).

Assuming you've been living in the current flat CGT is almost a non issue. If you're living there primary residence relief will cover you.

At this stage you wont get looked at too closely for trading either.  HMRC would need evidence that displaced your claim it was your home and that you bought it to live in. The fact that you did it up and sold it (even after owning it a short time) wouldn't make it a trade. Not **yet**.

That said... If you get looked say they might wonder where you got your mitts on seventy grand, if you don't have a good explanation.

If you start doing it repeatedly you're trading. This means you need to make returns as a self-employed person and tax at 20% on the profits with no exempt amounts (unlike CGT). I don't know if housing is  VAT exempt, but you might need to register for VAT.

Housing Benefit for private tenants rarely covers rent unless you're lucky enough to live in a cheaper than average house in a relatively affluent area (this is the funny thing about HB... if you can move by finding somewhere that doesn't discriminate against 'DSS'... move to an affluent area, get a bigger house, and it will cost you less than living in a poor area).

Thus, items such as ESA and DLA are often used to cover the rent as HB does not. I worry that cutting ESA for this particularly vulnerable group will lead to evictions. There is not enough council houses to go around to cover those which lose their private rental. And not enough cheaper private rentals which do not discriminate against benefit recipients.

Yet drugs policy seems to be completely divorced from the usual considerations about public spending and the good use of taxpayers’ money, and we simply have no proper public mechanism for knowing whether the money spent on the so-called war on drugs has been put to good effect.

It's an uphill struggle because DC's counter to that mother would have to be the reasoned argument that if her son wasn't forced to hide his drug problem he could have got treatment and been less likely to OD. That doesn't gain a lot of traction with someone angry and grieving.

Meanwhile, the pay off period for drug reform is measured in years, possibly up to a decade, which is very low 'payoff' for the party taking the risk to push it through.

false,Frap_Gadz,eng-eastsusex,We Wunt Be Druv,"I agree we're not the US, so let's assume we only care about calories here, how do we measure them and how do we quantify them in a useful way to the consumer?

Let's suppose we have an alcoholic drink that we calculate as containing 100 calories using the standard method by adding up the calories of the components that the human body can absorb (the Atwater system). Now we know that alcohol is a toxin and metabolises, mostly and eventually, to acetic acid which is then excreted. As such that 100 calories contained in the drink will be inefficiently digested and metabolised by the body and will unlikely to yield the full 100 calories. Also remember that alcohol is processed mainly by the liver and kidneys rather than that intestine where the majority of digestion occurs.

Compound this by the fact that the liver can only process so much alcohol for use as energy before it is overloaded with acetic acid and has to start dumping the excess as urine. Therefore if you drink slowly you'll likely digest more calories from the alcohol than someone who downed their drinks in a short space of time. 

Compare this to a 100 calorie soft drink, we know the human body digests and metabolises the carbohydrates in the soft drink very well and it's likely that this drink will yield almost all the calories.

So is it fair to compare a 100 calorie soft drink to a 100 calorie alcoholic drink?

My point being that the alcohol producers will argue about this until the cows come home and then eventually die of old age. This is mainly why alcoholic beverages are bereft of nutritional information.

Cannabis impairs decision making skills. You can drive around cones fine but when confronted with the need to perform an emergency manouvre, you're far more indecisive, being too slow or too reluctant to perform it.

If you're driving with the mindset that you need to be extra careful, you're even less likely to perform a required split second manouver.

True, but the omission of it made it worth mentioning in my opinion..

&gt;  fault is typically skewed towards the drivers (eg, see here)

Whilst I like to see citations and do appreciate it - I'm very very wary of statistics on road accidents. There's a myriad of factors involved in any road collision (up to and including weather, time of day, clothing, lights on the bike - not to mention road layout, direction, speeds etc.) - so when they report '21% of collisions were drivers failing to look properly' I'd want to know how much of that was genuinely down to driver error and how much of it was down to any of the factors above. 

Just last week I saw a cyclist nearly get hit by a car when pulling out from right behind a stopped bus - it was quite dark and the cyclist had no lights - would the driver have been found guilty of not looking properly? 

I'm not looking to excuse all drivers of careless driving. Having been hit by a car myself (whilst cycling) I know how shitty it is and how it can happen. But with so many variables involved, I wonder how accurate the stats are and whether they're taking everything into account or simplifying it down for bite sized consumption. 

&gt;  it seems a that the weighting of the responsibility towards the driver of the car is fair.

This I don't agree with. Responsibility for an accident should be weighted according to the precise situation - absolutely - but when cycling I take absolute responsibility for my actions, when driving I take absolute responsibility for my actions. 

I would hope that others do the same but having seen some very questionable driving and cycling here in Birmingham - I think this is something that needs to be taught further: that no matter what you're doing on the road, you are responsible for your own actions. That there's something bigger or faster or heavier than you on the road is irrelevant - *you* are responsible for how you conduct yourself on the road.

- I want to leave the EU. I think it is undemocratic and I think our politics is too different from other European nations for it to work as a democratic organisation. I think we would be richer if we had free trade agreements with lots of countries, rather than just with Europe, which is the most declining part of the world economy. Only UKIP will do this.
- I think we have had far too much immigration over the last decade or so. It just adds to pressure on house prices, puts more strain on public services, congests our roads and trains too much, and, in the case of non-EU immigration, there's a substantial minority of very unpleasant people who have no desire to integrate. I would like lower immigration and a system which is much more focused on the highly skilled. Labour and the Lib Dems want the immigration, and the Conservatives have failed to reduce it, so I'm left with UKIP.
- I have been utterly shocked by the scandal of thousands of kids being raped by grooming gangs in Rochdale, Rotherham and Manchester, and I know that similar things have been going on in other towns. I'm appalled there hasn't been a national inquiry over this, and I feel deeply let down by the three main parties not doing anything about it.

I'm not saying that you automatically get a ban or go to prison if you hit a cyclist (or pedestrian for that matter) when driving. What I'm saying is that in the event of an accident there are questions which should be asked of the driver - did they act with due care and caution? This should be asked regardless of the actions of the person they collided with.

Just because you have priority on a road doesn't mean you shouldn't be ready for someone to pull out and leave you with little time to react. If you're travelling along with parked cars either side at 30mph in a residential zone, you're not driving with caution even though you're driving within the speed limit, the laws on careless and dangerous driving are vague and I don't think many drivers even think about them.

In your example of a bike with no lights pulling out from behind a bus - yes it was poor on the cyclist's part, but as a driver you should be preparing for such situations - slowing down slightly as you near an obscured junction is a good idea, especially if the conditions are bad (raining, low light, etc). That said, if they had collided, I don't think the driver would deserve heavy punishment, but I'd at least expect their driving decisions in the lead up to be questioned.

What I'm saying is that you should increase your level of care and caution to reflect the damage/killing potential of the vehicle you're driving. I also believe this should be reflected in the law.

In fact it already is to some extend in that you require more testing/licensing to driver the largest vehicles.

Going back to your last paragraph - yes everyone is responsible for their own actions and conduct on the road, but you should also react to the actions of those around you and make allowances for them to make mistakes. In fact I believe that failing to leave sufficient time/space for another's mistake should be viewed as a mistake itself. The aftermath of a driver's mistake is nearly always a lot more costly in terms of damage and injuries to others than that of a cyclists, therefore I think they should be held to a higher level of responsibility - I currently believe far too many drivers are complacent and inattentive, which is why the law should be changed to reflect this.

BTW, I've also been knocked off my bike and it was 100% the driver's fault, but he essentially got away with it because the police just put it down to a non-serious accident (I wasn't maimed enough for it to count apparently) and the driver has nothing but a small insurance claim against him for the damage to my bike. I could've acted with more caution and assumed that the driver wasn't going to see me cycling along the main road in plain daylight, but then I think he should've looked in my direction before pulling out in front of me.. but there ya go.",0,1414756770,null,0,false,0,clp2tut,t3_2kv913,t1_clp2tut,t1_clp2gs2,null,1426258823,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Under English law, where a person causes death through extreme carelessness or incompetence, gross negligence is required. While the specifics of negligence may vary from one jurisdiction to another, it is generally defined as failure to exercise a reasonable level of precaution given the circumstances and so may include both acts and omissions. The defendants in such cases are often people carrying out jobs that require special skills or care, such as doctors, teachers, police or prison officers, or electricians, who fail to meet the standard which could be expected from a reasonable person of the same profession and cause death. In R v Bateman[7] the Court of Criminal Appeal held that gross negligence manslaughter involved the following elements:

    the defendant owed a duty to the deceased to take care;
    the defendant breached this duty;
    the breach caused the death of the deceased; and
    the defendant's negligence was gross, that is, it showed such a disregard for the life and safety of others as to amount to a crime and deserve punishment.

I'm planning on doing the placement year yeah, the uni has a lot of links with companies &amp; we'll be starting to work with the tutors to get ready for the placement year soon. One design company ""The Chase"" which is based in Preston is a major one with the uni, one of the co-owners is the professor you'll probably meet.

Work experience as a graphic designer is kind of tough, if that's what you want before your placement year it might be best to start doing some freelance stuff in your second year. That said, Manchester is only a short train ride away &amp; there's lots of companies there, maybe you could get lucky and get an internship.

My first semester of my first year was mostly spent doing short 1 week briefs, to pretty much teach you how to research and think properly. After that I did a project to create a monogram for myself, a project to design a christmas card for someone in a specific industry, then I did a project to create an editorial about a designer. My 2nd year so far I've done a digital editorial and am working on rebranding a festival. After this I'll be doing a web design project &amp; I'm not sure after that. What happens is they will give us a brief, we work on it, we show them our work as we go along to make sure it's in the right direction and at some point we'll have a crit session where everyone will pin their work up and we'll go around the class and everyone will talk about their own work. If it's a long project you'll normally do a crit session half way through and then a final one at the end.

The negatives hm. I'm not sure if you'd consider it a negative, but a lot of your time will be spent away from uni. You're usually in 3-4 days a week in first year and currently I'm only in 2 days a week in 2nd year. For me it's not a problem since I prefer to do my work at home anyway but some people like having the tutors be teaching them all the time. That said, you can always go in and find a space in the studio to do your work if you want to be in, just the tutors might be busy. 

Sure, PM me if you like just maybe remind me who you are :)

The interview isn't much to do with immigration save a few paragraphs at the end, it's a bit of a shame that newspapers prefer to pick up on that. Anyway,

&gt;Blair is frustrated that, for many Britons, Iraq effectively disqualifies him from contributing to this debate [...] this is something … I’ve spent not just my time in office but … the last seven years studying. I’m out in the Middle East twice a month, I’m seeing it first-hand. So when people say, “Oh, well don’t listen to him because of Iraq”, well, precisely because I’ve gone through these experiences it may just be that it’s worth at least listening to my reflections on them.’

In anticipation of more circle- and knee-jerk responses like,

In terms of the criminal side, I want the police to aggressively pursue drivers who are involved in accidents with vulnerable road users and make every effort to secure a conviction against them. The assumption by a police officer on arriving at a RTA involving a car and a bike should be that the driver was to blame and they should immediately begin gathering evidence against them and unless there is an obvious mitigating circumstance then they should be looking for a prosecution ASAP.

In terms of the civil side, I want the assumption to be that the driver was at fault unless they can prove otherwise.

They've been doing this since the beginning of time. Nothing the university does will be able to stop this, short of having a very American zero tolerance policy on any student found drinking while a member of the University. Which is absolutely ridiculous, firstly because it wouldn't stop anyone, and secondly because Universities do not have any right or say on what an individual does on their own time.

The whole university culture is the side effect you get when a bunch of young adults experience freedom and personal space and privacy for the first time. We grow out of it, and it's an almost essential part of growing up. Doing stupid things until you realise (most commonly in your final year) you don't want that any more and you'd actually like to succeed in life. So you stop.

Most student unions/universities try and encourage responsible drinking and are really good at cutting people off in the union bar when they've had too much, handing out unit calculator wheels and reminding everyone the healthy limits etc. They are again limited by the fact that they can't, and have no right to, place restrictions on people's private lives. 

This is absolutely the right way to go about helping students, because the point we're all forgetting here is that this was a group of let's say 20 students out of the thousands attending that particular University.

You gather a large group of students like that, and 99% of them are going to be relatively responsible. They're probably going to get drunk, act a bit reckless and irresponsibly but they'll wake up with less money and a hangover. It only affects them. It's an incredibly small minority that actually do something like this, that affects others in any sort of scope. These individuals should be punished (by the law where possible) and it would be wrong for the University to try and impose any sorts of punishments/restrictions to students as a whole - because overall they're really not that bad.

Wind turbines are spinning curved conductors; they cause hell with air traffic control radars when they’re put in the wrong spot. A number of key off-shore windfarm locations in the north sea were blocked due to concerns around how it might create blind-spots in both ATC and air-defence systems facing in the direction of Russia.

There was a big drive to create [‘stealthy’ wind turbines]( http://www.gizmag.com/stealth-wind-turbine-invisible-to-radar/13260/) by embedding radar absorbent material within the blades composite structure, as this was viewed as a good civilian application for a (largely) military technology that was otherwise difficult to support research for with government funding.

The radar developers eventually beat the turbine developers to the solution however, and came up with a new system which could filter a lot of the interference created by the turbines.  It is wrong however to assume that these upgrades only exist to enable more wind-farms however; they’re more often included within upgrades with a much larger scope of improving integrated ATC across the UK and Europe.

The act of hitting anything with your car is very likely to be careless in my opinion. Assuming I was sure of the identity of the driver I'd probably be immediately swayed towards guilty on a charge of careless driving - in some ways it would be up to the testimony of the driver/witnesses and other evidence to convince me that they were not.

Properties that were let to two adults are having their tenancies revoked when the landlords discover the couple failed to declare their multiple children/elderly parents would be living there. Why did the tenants not declare the rest of their family? Because they would have never been let the property to begin with. It would be unacceptable for the government to provide council housing for, for example, a 2 bed property to a family of two parents, three children and a grandparent and it should be no different in the private sector. 

As for the refusal to rent to people who don't fulfil the rental insurance criteria because of their zero hour contracts - would you let out a property to somebody you had good reason to doubt if they could pay the rent?

They poll way too low though and might even lose their only MP, but my point is the debates are there to increase the vote.

I'm totally against the Miliband vs Cameron debate, it just gives them even more advantage in the general election, I'm also against Farage only being in one.

If there were 3 debates with all the 5 leaders then there would be enough time to discuss all their policies. One debate with two, one debate with 3, and one debate with 4 is not really democracy and it just gives the election to Labour or the Tories.

I have to agree with some of the concerns I've heard.
If you're going to do a statue like this, it should be part of a series of statues IE a couple of gay dads, a couple of lesbian mums, a heterosexual couple, a single mum, a single dad, grandparent/carers. Maybe even go as far as including a family of dwarves or someone in a wheelchair.

Sounds extreme (and expensive) but the only way to avoid upset would be to include every demographic.

Occasionally someone will be duped and will unwittingly post something.

When that happens I just explain to the poster who BF are, what they stand for and how their scams operate. 

If people post fake news items of fake statistics, of the 'immigrants get X amount of benefits' kind I do my best to give them the true facts from reliable sources to debunk the myths. It's kind of funny because I've had friends going through the immigration procedure themselves to move to this country getting upset because they think other immigrants are getting special treatment. For example one Iranian asylum seeker friend of mine got really upset because she read that Somalis moving here get given British citizenship automatically.

By doing that I am increasing the risk of a collision because I'm likely to get rear ended by cars coming round bends behind me or at least force them to brake erratically. It would also encourage other drivers to overtake me which increases the risk further. There are other factors in this situation than just me and the possible (highly unlikely) risk of encountering an unlit cyclist. 

Its unreasonable to put a nationwide cap of 20mph for driving at night.

Its not unreasonable, in fact its a legal requirement, for cyclists to have lights.

The basic rules of containing risk is that it should be done to the greatest level without excessively limiting the intended function. The optimum way to achieve safety and still have functional roads is for cyclists to wear lights.

Yes, it would be astronomical.  The source of the minerals is the rock that the ground is made of.  Therefore, you'd have to have a water source that _was not in the south east of England_ to prevent this problem.

Given that water in such short supply in that area that the water from the Thames goes through, on average, 8 people, during its route from the source to the sea, you're talking about a _huge_ volume of water that would be needed.  Impoted water can't be reused in the same way, so that's a net 8 fold _increase_ in volume needed …

The other options, of using ion-exchange (aka water softeners) is similarly prohibitive on the massive scale.  Instead, it's much more cost effective for a small water softener to be installed domestically for the drinking water.  This obviates the need to soften the water for other uses (washing clothes, dishes and people; and flushing toilets), hence cuts the cost significantly.  

And, even then, ""softened"" water is _not_ the same thing as 'soft' water - you replace the Ca and MG ions with sodium, so there's a significantly higher mineral content still.  This has concerns for those sensative to mineral load - in particular babies can cope with a lot of mixed ions, but replacing it all with sodium can cause problems for some.  That's why the advice to not use softened water for babies arises from.

Back of envelope calculations suggest you'd need a pipe the size of the river Thames, from at least the north of England, if not up to the Highlands.

The problem arises when people have to rent in the same place for a decade or more, because they will never have the one-off capital to own a home, even if they spend much more than the value of the home on the rent over many years.

In such cases, it is much more efficient for the economy and fair to the people, if they were able to buy a permanent house to live in. It is economically inefficient because the landlord being a middle man is creating a cost while adding nothing of value to the good/service.

There needs to be a balance.

I have found a pharmacy very close to Slade Green station to take the postcode from, but it seems that Slade Green is in fact just a train station and the surrounding area is considered to be Erith. What you need to do is to look at a) the postcodes in the area you're considering buying in and b) the breakdown, specifically looking at violence and sexual offences in my opinion. The SG postcode puts it at 198 crimes for the month, which is very, very low. But remember not much happens there, nor does it where I currently am (Blackfen), so the stats are similar. However, the postcode for my last flat in North London shows 900+ crime incidents! Bear in mind that I lived on a busy high street in a popular area though. You have to take it with a pinch of salt though: in the 2.5 years I lived there, I never saw a single bit of trouble, and that included being out an about in the early hours of the morning. I'm not prepared to give out my old postcode to the internet but I will message you with it. 

The break downs are really good; look out for other red flags such as shootings and murders. Always bear in mind the size of the population in the area when you consider crime stats. Look up census data.

I hope this helps a bit.

1: There are poor people in this country.

2: This is bad and we must do something about it.

3: People only do things due to being incentivised to do so, or lacking the proper deterrence. 

4: Therefore poor people must lack the proper motivation to work themselves out of poverty.

5: If paying work isn't motivating them enough, then the benefits system must be being too lenient on them.

6: Therefore the solution to poverty is to make being poor less attractive, deterring them from being poor. 

Of course the problems with this line of thinking are pretty obvious if you don't think that way: people actually don't respond so rationally to incentives; factors such as eduction and disability play a role; social and economic backgrounds also play a role; not to mention the non-sequiter that is ""working yourself out of poverty"" in a country where the living wage is now quite seriously detached from the minimum wage &amp;etc. 

But then people on the economic right also tend to not be poor, and studies have shown that the more you have, the more you attribute this to your own merit and thus the more likely you are to believe in meritocracy and right wing ideology (I'm rich, I became rich because I worked hard and am a great person, therefore poor people have just failed to work hard!). It's worth noting that conversely those with very little tend to overplay the role of society in their own failure. Ego is a terrible thing.

Cost.  It costs about £1000 + £80 a year to install and run a domestic water softener.  Scale that up to bulk supply, and you'd be looking at a high jump in the water prices (probably trebling).  It's one of the cases where it's genuinely cheaper for each person that wants softened water to install one themselves, than to have it done at source.  The key observation is that this allows for many uses where the water softener isn't needed to skip it (e.g. a garden tap), rather then softening everything.

Oh, and drinking only softened water will kill some people; so there's that too.  This is why when you install a water softener, your obliged to have a tap supplying non-softed water in the kitchen.

&gt; it's more desirable to use soft water to stop damage to water handling equipment.

Much of what is now western Europe was once the bottom of a fairly shallow, warm sea. Lots of little shellfish died and sank to the bottom and over millions of years their shells got squished and formed chalk.

More time passed and this chalk eventually got pushed upwards (continental drift and stuff being the driving force) and became dry land.

Then about 15,000 years ago everything got very chilly and the glaciers came down from the Arctic. A two mile high wall of ice is more than capable of scraping away hundreds of metres of chalk (which is a pretty soft rock) so basically any part of the UK which was significantly glaciated is now no longer chalky. 

So the TLDR for why you get bits in your kettle in London but not elsewhere is ""the Ice Age"". :-)

Going that slowly is not driving to the conditions. As I pointed out in my other comment, it reduces one risk but increases others:

""Regardless of speed no one can see a cyclist in all black on the side of an unlit road until they are within that sort of distance. I could have been walking along at 4mph and I still wouldn't have seen him until I got that close.

Like I said I had to swerve. For me to stop I would have had to be doing 20mph on a 50mph road. That is unsafe. That is too slow. By doing that I am increasing the risk of a collision because I'm likely to get rear ended by cars coming round bends behind me or at least force them to brake erratically. It would also encourage other drivers to overtake me which increases the risk further. There are other factors in this situation than just me and the possible (highly unlikely) risk of encountering an unlit cyclist."" 

The only way not to increase those other risks is for everyone to drive at about 20mph. To achieve that you would need a cap.

&gt;Thats a totally different situation.

Why?

You are making so very many assumptions about me, all of them wrong. I'm nowhere near stereotypically straight, and nowhere near stereotypically gay, either. What kind of ""us or them"" mentality must YOU have in order to leap to that conclusion, hm?

Fact is, flamboyant gays tend to be the ones who are completely shallow and looks-obsessed, and aren't capable of being in a relationship without cheating. A lot of this is probably because people like you reinforce that this is how gay guys are SUPPOSED to be, because **obviously** anything else is just pandering to the straights, right?

Sugar, as sucrose, has about 3.8 calories per gram. 

The density of alcohol is about half that of sugar, so you're loosing about 10% of the total calories on an 'even mass' basis.

Notably, during fermentation 1kg of sugar doesn't turn to 1kg of alcohol - at best you get 0.5111 kg of alcohol (the rest is lost as CO2), and usual a 90% yield there is considered good.  Hence, half the sugar turns to alcohol is a good rule of thumb.

So, at a hand wave sort of level, fermenting 6kg of sugar, and you'll expect to have the the caloroific equivalent of 3kg of sugar.

That's 'back of envelope' level calulcations - different sugars, different yeasts etc all play a part.  

Of course, that's assuming that all calories are equal - and there's some evidence that alcohol is preferential shuffled into fat.

the issue I take with you comment is that yes - we can probably agree that in most situations you are correct. The issue I have is in many situations your are not. 

Many towns and villages have blind bends, don't have proper crossing areas (many villages up north don't even have pavements), motorists don't always indicate etc. There are situations where motorist should drive below the speedlimit but choose not to.

&gt;By the time you come into headlight range it's too late. 

Theres that slippery slope. If you followed the HWC you would drive to a speed where stopping within what you can see wouldn't be a problem :P

I was driving along, early this year. It was a horrible night, pouring rain. I was doing a hair under the speed limit, probably about 27mph. The road I was driving down always has cars parked up both sides, so there's a lot of letting people go/being let go, etc. There are street lights but, as usual, they're not very good and don't all work. OK, the scene is set.

I'm driving along and there are some parked cars to my left. I slow slightly and move right a little to go round the cars. It's at this moment that I catch a slight glint on my left. I braked to be safe and saw that it was a cyclist, wearing all black with a black bike and no lights. It was pure luck that I saw him at all. If I hadn't, I would most likely have knocked him off his bike, through absolutely no fault of my own. I wasn't speeding, I was being careful and observant.

It's all well and good saying: 

&gt; If you've not got a great enough stopping distance to allow yourself time to stop for any unlit objects in the road, you're going too fast.

But how is that true if you *cannot see the object at all*? The cyclist in my example was just lucky his coat had a slightly waxy finish, making it a little bit shiny. Otherwise, I wouldn't have seen him at all. You're basically implying that drivers are required to have either infrared vision or psychic powers.

false,SuspectLemon,null,null,"The article raises a few points about the issue of drug decriminalization. However the most interesting of which must be:
“We did not in our fact-finding observe any obvious relationship between the toughness of a country’s enforcement against drug possession, and levels of drug use in that country,”.
If it is indeed true that drugs are consistently used by a portion of the public regardless of the legal status of substances in the country, then it is simply nonsensical to punish and waste tax payers money on what appears to be a fruitless effort. If on the other hand drugs are legalized and properly taxed, then more money can be raised to benefit other members of the public. It is undeniable that legalizing the use of drugs will increase drug use somewhat, and though much debate is to be had, it is generally agreed that prolonged drug use will have a negative affect on someones life. 

When it really comes down to it, a rather utilitarian approach can be made towards the legalization of drugs. As long as the money saved from the prosecution and enforcement of drug offences plus the tax revenue that can be made from drugs is higher than the cost of treating drug related illnesses and the loss of the productive members so society; then it just seems silly not to legalize it.

Most people say they need a ""rental cap"" in London but not ""up north"" as prices in London are spiralling.

What they do not know is what you call ""Rental Yield"" down south is AWFULL and Up North is Great.

Put simply the ""profit margin"" down south is crap because of the high mortgage amount means high monthly payments.

You cap rent in the south; and then the mortgages become un-payable (and actually invalid with the 125% requirement for lenders). If those people do not sell up what is guaranteed is any furture ""rent to interest"" calculations from mortgage lenders will not meet the 125% scale - so no more property investors.

One study I've seen suggests ceramide levels in skin are lower in the winter, so different lipids could be used in different seasons.

I do look for bioidentical ceramides in skincare products, not least because there are no rich natural sources (tho ingredients like lecithin, niacinamide and lactic acid may boost synthesis in the skin). I also note my skin [*inactive eczema, active but mild rosacea*] tends to do well with any product containing lanolin which is a rich source of cholesterol esters, but also has skin friendly saturated fatty acids.

With research ongoing I suspect it's best to experiment and see which lipids seem to make YOUR skin the most hydrated/ least sensitive. I'd love to try TrueLipids but bank balance says NO!!

To my mind this had a positive effect mostly because of personnel. Because the wingers are comfortable that there is no Gerrard to have to rely on defensively, they can stay forward. Otherwise there is a tendency for it to really be 4 5 1 in defence with limited outlets on the counter esp with a slow striker. 

The same applies to the fullbacks who were also able to stay forward because there is slightly more trust in the defence if it is not Stevie. 

In attack we are usually 3 4 3 in transition and then 3 2 5 for full overload. 

The middle of the three at the back during attacking possession is normally Gerrard, which is the root cause of our shaky defence at the moment.

Seriously?), but I was talked into trying the audios, and I loved them. They convinced me that McGann hadn't been a poor actor, rather a good actor with shit writing. The Chimes of Midnight, which is an Eighth Doctor audio story, is absolutely amazing and is one of RTD and Moffat's favorite stories. Gone is the 'hip, half-human, isweartogodi'mcoollikemeamerica' writing that McGann had suffered through in the movie, and instead there was fantastic, ingenious writing with brilliant characterization and, in the case of Chimes, a heavy inspiration from classical literary absurdism to the degree that I was able to write a paper on absurdism and use it as a primary example.

McGann was a good actor with awful writing and characterization in the TV Movie, and the audios managed to salvage my opinion of his Doctor, especially as Big Finish set out to break him more and more so that we can see how he became the person who fought in the Time War. I honestly cannot praise enough the character development they put him through, slowly and subtly changing him from a hyper tiggerish personality and incorrigible romantic to a cynical, snarky personality who's beginning to realize that he is at war with the Daleks.

Just think about bomby night fireworks. Down in London you've got the Ally Pally display which is fucking huge with laser shows and everything and attracts about 50,000 people. Entrance is like £8 or free for under the 10's. Either way, they are making a lot of money and enough to fund the show.

Around the corner, my local Cricket club also puts on a pretty decent display but they only attract about 1,000 people so, to be able to put on a good show they need to also charge £8 (and £4 for kids) even though the actual display is no where near as good as Ally Pally's, you are still paying the same.

Likewise is the difference between Netflix and LFCTV. 

If we want LFCTV to put on a good show, a better show than presently, then we have to understand that they need to raise the money from somewhere.

&gt; **Nature of offence: Level 1**  
&gt; The most serious offences encompassing driving that involved a deliberate decision to ignore (or a flagrant disregard for) the rules of the road and an apparent disregard for the great danger being caused to others 

&gt; Starting point: 8 years custody  
&gt; Sentencing range: 7-14 years custody  

&gt;**Nature of offence: Level 2**  
Driving that created a substantial risk of danger 

&gt; Starting point: 5 years custody   
&gt; Sentencing range: 4-7 years custody

&gt;**Nature of offence: Level 3**  
Driving that created a significant risk of danger

&gt; [where the driving is markedly less culpable than for this level, reference should be made to the starting point and range for the most serious level of causing death by careless driving]

&gt; Starting point: 3 years custody   
&gt; Sentencing range: 2-5 years custody


And level 1, 2, 3 are determined by how severely dangerous the driver was driving. e.g.

* Level 1: A prolonged, persistent and deliberate course of very bad driving

* Level 2: Greatly excessive speed, racing or competitive driving against another driver

I've never understood the firemen's protests, ~£29k a year plus OT with a shit-ton of down time.  I have 3 friends who are firemen and they all follow the same trend of highly uneducated people who's only options in life (in their opinion) were the army or the fire brigade. Whilst this doesnt represent all firemen im confident these are not isolated incidents. 


Local fire stations near me seem to have very little to do bar a few times of the year (now being one of those times) and most of those times are minor events like a bin on fire. Most of their job seems to be RTA's which can hardly be deemed as dangerous for them, big fires are few and far between for most stations. 


I know ive held some unpopular beliefs about the fire service for a long time but ~£29k+OT to mainly sit on your arse or train is a pretty good wage imo. You knew the wages before you signed up, a good chunk of you had little to no other options of employment and to say you risk your lives like the army or police is complete hogwash

- Zabaleta is 33 and he felt homesick so he left to Monaco (really? France? Monsieur Pablo)

- Kolarov is still going strong, he grew a few points for me but he is currently at 79 playing a secondary role to Alaba.

- Silva denied all the contracts offer and moved to Bayern, I refused and the board intervened (this still hurts, he was rated 90 and has all the magic in the world, little dick)

- Aguuuuueeeeero is my star, he is just godly.

- Sagna was old and hated him so I got rid of him.

- Willy was sent back to Spain and Bought Leno to be the second keeper. (Hart still n°1)

- The ferns are playing prety good, specially Nando, he is currently 84 with amazing defensive stats. A true octopus.

- Nasri took Silva's spot and is going strong in his LW role.

- Nastasic is on loan still and can get him to grow a single point. I tried everything. Just like in real life,  I still have a lot of hope on him, he's still young.

- Kompany is the team leader, is enormous.

- Clichy was old and exchanged him for Alaba.

- Dzeko is 31, was getting very slow, and was sitting on the bench behind Aguero and Rodrigo (I use 1 ST) so I feel that I was disrespecting all his years of service and deserves something better, and offer from Valencia came and I let him go so he could be a star the last few years of his career.

- Malanda is my starter CB alongside Kompany.

- Lopes is turning into a world class, currently on loan on Monaco.

- Zuculini was a great surprise, he is pretty good in game. Has a lot more physicality than in real life. 

- Navas was complaining of not getting much playing time, so I sold him and bought Bale (dirty, unrealistic move but it's awesome)

- Bought Alexis Sánchez too (needed wingers), I play 4-3-3 with 1 CDM (Fernando) and two CM. 

- Demichellis retired too. He is insanely slow on game, but for reason he performed decently even in his last years. 

- Boyata was so shit, I have to release him, nobody wanted him, he is siting on Free Agents, I feel kinda bad now for the kid.

- I kept Richards until this very season, he is impressive in game due to his athleticism so I liked him a lot (besides I really like him for his inside city videos) finally was sold this season to Fiorentina.

- Milner was getting little playtime because of the strong midfield I have and the fact that I don't use RM/LM, so I tried to sold him to a club where he could be the unrivaled starter, I sold him to a team in Germany don't remember. 

- Lampard retired after 1 season, was decent during that spell.

- Jovetic never worked for me, he was injured constantly (I play with 75 injure slider) and neve grew a single point, was playing too little, so he was very mad, board sold him to.... fucking liverpool and ended up being the top goalscored of the BPL this season, what the fuck, tired to re buy him and said something The fans would never accept me after the story between our teams or something like that.

**Wall of text, incoming:**   

&gt;  ""Thank you for contacting us about the proposed format for the 2015 General Election debates. We have received a wide range of feedback from supporters of different political parties across the UK. In order to use our TV licence fee resources efficiently, this response aims to answer the key concerns, but we apologise in advance if it doesn’t address your specific points in the manner you would prefer.

&gt; The BBC is working with other broadcasters to try and make election debates happen in 2015 and we believe we have set out a fair and realistic formula. Twenty two million people saw some of the debates in 2010. They were very successful in engaging the electorate, especially first time voters and the broadcasters would like them to happen again at next year’s general election. We are also putting forward our own proposals for other debates across the UK.

&gt; Ensuring impartiality during an election campaign is a priority and judgements about debates, and other programmes, are taken on the basis of objective editorial assessments of a number of factors, including the levels of past and current electoral support for each party.

&gt; Although UKIP did not win a seat in the 2010 general election, they polled more than three times as many votes as the Green Party, which did win a seat. In the 2014 European elections, UKIP topped the poll, beating all the Westminster parties in terms of seats (24) and share of the vote (more than 27% - up more than 10% on 2009). The Greens won three seats in the European election, with just under 8% of the vote (a small drop since 2009).

&gt; UKIP have also performed strongly in local government elections in England for the past two years and have more councillors than the Greens. Before their victory in Clacton, UKIP had come second in every Westminster by-election for the last two years – the Greens’ best performance was around 4%.

&gt; We also take account of opinion polls, when there is a robust and consistent trend: UKIP have been regularly polling in the mid-teens for more than two years, well ahead, for instance, of the Liberal Democrats and around 10 percentage points ahead of the Greens.

&gt; The BBC has since responded to a letter from the Green Party, which expressed disappointment at the proposals unveiled by the UK’s four leading broadcasters for election debates next year. You can read the response in full at:

&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/statements/green-party-letter

&gt; In Scotland, the BBC is proposing a debate, in peak time on BBC One, involving the leaders of the SNP, Scottish Labour, the Scottish Conservative and Scottish Liberal Democrat parties. We are proposing a similar format of debate on BBC One from Wales, involving the leaders of Plaid Cymru, Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and UKIP. We have written to the parties to begin discussions about our proposals and we will ensure impartiality during the Election in Scotland and Wales. Full details of our content will be released over the coming months once they are finalised.

&gt; We hope this goes some way in addressing your concerns, thanks again for taking the time to contact us.

&gt; Kind Regards

So better than a huge majority of public sector pensions? You dont get to retire 10 years early, only 5? Boohoo. I'm pretty sure a 60 year old fireman will have progressed higher (even with your low intellects) than the guy who has to go into the building on fire once a year. Would he not get a fancy hat and get to tell the others what to do? So how is that a danger to anyone, 60 year old people are very competent unless firefighters age faster than normal people?


I think nurses, doctors, soldiers and policeman do far more. The best bit is that they rarely moan as much as you leaches yet they have far more right to - i guess they care more about public safety and dont want people to die, hmmmm maybe thats why the public support them 


So over £30k wage to sit on your arse 90% of the day, retire at 60 on £26k a year... But you want more. You're lucky i'm not in charge.

Wholetime. These stations have people manning them 24 hours a day. They are supposed to be out of the front doors responding within a minute. These stations serve busy or high risk areas. 

Retained or On Call. These stations are staffed by firefighters who carry pagers. When they are needed their pager activates and they attend the station and must be fully equipped and that fire engine must be rolling withing a specified time (usually 5 minutes from the pager activating). These firefighters are paid per call out thereby savong taxpayer money as they only get paid whwn they are needed. Some on call stations might get 10 call outs in a year, some might get 400. They typically serve smaller towns or even villages, but are also there to attend larger fires when additional resources are needed to go into other station areas (it takes more than one fire engine to deal with a house fire).

Day staffing. This mixed the two. In the daytime they have cre there to respond, but in the lower risk times (evenings usually) they revert to being an on-call station. These stations usually serve areas not busy enough to require a wholetime station and too busy to make a retained station appropriate.

For me, it's vital that fernando doesn't start (get's caught on the ball too much), yaya isn't depended on (obvious) and milner plays in there instead. 

If Ferna and Milner can stop Rooney and Di Maria, we'll shut down their whole attack, and while we haven't be great going forward recently, they should actually be easier to break down that West Ham. Play 4-4-2 and we'll be in trouble anyway.

SEASON 5 SPOILERS

Another small question that now comes to mind, if you don't mind: So, if I understand things correctly, the Doctor we see on the other side of the crack, the one who is falling in reverse through his own timestream, he is lost forever. He makes that beautiful little speech to  sleeping child Amy about something borrowed and blue and then disappears behind the crack, presumably outside of the crack and the universe and out of existence forever. Which brings me to my question: Is that version of the Doctor lost forever, and the Doctor that Amy creates out of her memories based on her most recent memory of him? I think my whole difficulty with this finale was that it set things up as being that the Doctor HAD to end up on the other side of the crack to save the universe. That he COULDN'T be saved. So when he was brought back at the wedding so quickly after, it felt like they created this dramatic moment and then reversed it immediately for no good reason. They made it so he HAD to be stuck. But did they unstuck him by letting Amy's memories just create an exact clone of him, thereby dancing around the fact that the true Doctor was stuck behind the crack and wiped forever? But then again, she doesn't just create a clone, but by remembering him, she reinstates all of the moments he has ever existed and will ever exist back into the universe. So is that person the real Doctor, or a clone like plastic Rory at the wedding? I am so dreadfully confused.

Then, when you graduate, you will have £1000 of overdraft which you will have to pay interest on. This is really good, because even if you realise pretty quick, you probably can't pay that back.

About half a million students start uni each year, so assuming 75% take up a student account (free rail pass!), then later, 5% fail to pay back the overdraft and incur £250 of interest payments, that means that 500000 * 0.75 * 0.05 * 100 = £1.9 million profit.

So that's a pretty good point.

From your point of view, you can worry less about money as you have a huge overdraft, which is a load of your mind if you are a bit broke.

We do not have a ""system"" to speak of yet, but I am hoping that's why Poch was brought in. I think this would guarantee the most long term success and we would be less likely to encounter growing pains e.g. the Bale money. 

This system starts with the youth academy and I believe those brought through recently play quite well with our first team. Some of the players may not be good enough in the traditional sense but usually play to their and the teams strengths while our bought players normally go out and try to ""to their thing"" e.g. Pauli. 

That is how we always end up with teams who are less than the sum of their parts (do you need an example?). All of the big four have their system: Chelsea, solid and organized defensively with dynamic players who sting quickly; Man City, technically superior; Arsenal, not to ambitious pass it about and maybe they get bored or Sanchez makes magic and even Man Utd have begun to rebuild with Van Gaal's principles.

Then you have teams like Swansea who do not have the most talent but will always know what they are supposed to be doing. Bar their EL year, the have done very well for themselves. 

Often our players seem to not understand their roles or simply choose not to do them, it must stop. 

We constantly chop and change managers which means our scouting suffers because what kind of player should be looking for? With consistent management and a framework in place we may actually be able to find these players who can contribute to Tottenham Hotspur in a meaningful way. It does not help to change our scouting without feedback and continued relationship building with our first team coaches and staff in the beginning. Once we have gained an identity, our dependence on a manager will be far less and we will be able to excel from there.

Did you know people who investigate traffic accidents don't believe there is any such thing as an accident - there is always someone or someones responsible. Things just don't happen.

Anyway - I think for the most part we agree. You are just more sympathetic to negligence than I am.

In my opinion negligence is almost always totally avoidable (see driving too fast, tailgating, overtaking on blind bends, being tired, not paying attention etc), and I think where negligence has been proven to be avoidable those who are guilty of this should receive much longer driving bans than they currently do - In part to reflect the dangers their negligence poses and in part to make the roads safer for others.

I agree for the most part a jail sentence is punishing someone in the wrong way.

Part of the problem (I believe) is that many motorists/cyclists (myself included in a car/bike) simply forget how dangerous driving is and take unnecessary risks. That attitude is part maybe all of the problem.

Correct, but more generally that ideologies like communism and fascism would not have found a foothold in Europe had Germany won, and thus a whole lot of bad would have been prevented from occurring worldwide. Of course this is speculative, but consider how widely accepted it is that at points in history had events gone differently the world would be much worse off, (obvious examples being if the cold war went hot or the Nazis had won etc) but so rarely do we think about how things could have turned out better.

There's not really any difference between ""softened"" water and plain old soft water, as far as I know, other than the natural variations in other minerals and contaminants. ""Soft"" vs. ""hard"" only really refers to magnesium and calcium traces.

I use a water softener (this one: http://www.monarchwater.co.uk/products/ultimate-midi/). Cost was £500, but installation would usually be another £500 or so, as there's quite a bit of pipework needed.

Basically, the water is run through resin beads, which attract calcium and magnesium ions (which make the water ""hard"") exchanging them for sodium and potassium ions. Eventually, the beads get saturated by the ions, but you can reverse the process by flushing the resin with salt water. The softener has a tank full of salt tablets to generate the salt water when needed. This doesn't make the water taste salty - the system is bypassed while it's being flushed (usually overnight).

It's still a good idea to have a drinking water tap that bypasses the system - fully soft water tastes kinda flat - but it's safe to drink. There's usually also an outside tap so you can run a hose without ""using up"" the resin.

Soft water is good for bathrooms, kettles and washing machines, as it completely eliminates limescale formation, and makes soap lather really well.

This is probably fairly common, but with mine Lloyds offered a £2,000 interest free overdraft for the first year after graduation, 1500 after the second, and 1000 after the third. When you're trying to live away from home, the extra and prolongued free credit can come in really, really useful if you're trying to make ends meet or haven't yet saved up an emergency fund from any jobs. 

So while I didn't use my student account at university, when it became a graduate account it was a lifesaver, especially when I lost my job.
