Liverpool then go on to beat City 5-0 and go 5 points ahead of City with a vastly superior goal difference. Sunderland also beat City 4-3 after an Altidore hattrick (too far-fetched?? Probably). Sunderland clamber out of the relegation zone and stay there for the rest of the season.

In the Liverpool-Chelsea match, Ivanovic bites Suarez and gets sent off and a subsequent season-long ban. This is due to Suarez having run Ivanovic ragged for the best part of an hour in which he'd nutmegged the unfortunate sod 5 times.

Other than City's losses vs Arsenal, Liverpool and Sunderland...and Chelsea's loss against us, we all win all our remaining games and we win the league title.

true,L__McL,,Who would win us the Cup? Tim sure would.,"This is great. Well done redcafe.net for doing this sort of thing. Anyway:

Q1: What have you made of how Moyes has done for United this season?

I always like Moyes at Evertone. At united he seems out of his depth. Although it's amusing for the rest of us, I do feel sorry for him. I reckon I'd probably want him gone if I were a United fan

Q2: Where do you think United will finish in the league come the end of the season, and how do you think we’ll do against Bayern in the Champions League?

I imagine United will finish 7th. Against Bayern I'm predicted a close but definitive defeat. Maybe 3-1 over the two legs? Saying that, I seem to have overrating United all season (In December I put a bet on you finishing in the top 4).

Q3: In our last game, a lot of fans had reached breaking point, with some fans reportedly abusing Ferguson over his appointment of Moyes, stewards protecting the “The Chosen One” banner after fans threatened to take it down, and a fan being held back from attacking Moyes. Now, apparently some United fans are planning on funding a bannerto fly over Old Trafford for our game calling for Moyes to be sacked. What do you make of all this?

Seems a bit over the top. Maybe because United fans aren't used to wanting a manager gone. Trying to attack Moyes is disgraceful behaviour and I'm surprised fans are blaming Ferguson. IMO he did leave Moyes in a hard position but it's silly to abuse a United legend.

Q4: What have you made of Benteke’s second season at your club, and do you think he’ll still be there next season as he has been linked to a few clubs this season?

I think he's had a good season. Not as explosive as last season but he's still got a very good return, especially considering his injury. I hope he stays but I wouldn't be surprised if he goes, especially if he has a good World Cup.

Q5: In January, you loaned Bertrand from Chelsea. How has he done for you, and what do you make of his comments that he wouldn’t rule out staying at Villa? Would you be happy to see a permanent deal made for him in the summer?

I think Bertrand is excellent. We need a better left back. I would love to sign him in the summer.

Q6: What are your goals with Lambert? Do you feel that he is the right man to establish you as a top half team once again?

I have always stood by Lambert. On here and elsewhere I've always defended him. I think we are improving. We're on course to finish mid-table, perhaps even top half. We have a young, improving squad, if we make the right signings and cut out needless losses to the likes of Stoke and Palace I expect us to be a top half team.

Q7: Do you take pride in the fact that opposition supporters speak wistfully of the days when FA Cup semi finals used to take place at Villa Park?

I always took pride in Villa Park being a semi-final host. I expect a lot of fans are annoyed Wembley is a bit less special if it's for semi-finals as well, more than wanting Villa Park back. Nevertheless I think Villa Park is one of those stadiums, like Anfield, that fans admire.

Q8: Are there any youth prospects you have that you’re excited about/looking forward to perhaps see breakthrough in the future?

We won the NextGen series last season (Youth equivalent of the Champions League) so we must have something. Most notable youth players seem to be Jack Grealish, Michael Drennan, Samir Curruthers and Janoi Donacien. We've had a good history of bringing youth players through over the last 10 years so hopefully it will continue.

Q9: Who do you feel has been your best and worst signing this season?

Best signings are Jores Okore, although he's been injued he looks very promising, Leandro Bacuna and Benteke signing a new contract. Worst has without a doubt been Grant Holt. One of the most useless players we've had in years. 

Q10: Which XI would you like to see your team field against us?

Guzan, Bacuna, Vlaar, Baker, Bertrand, Westwood, El Ahmadi, Delph, Weimann, Agbonlahor, Benteke.

Q11: Finally, your predictions for the match?

I think we have a chance of repeating out performances against the likes of Chelsea, City, Liverpool and Arsenal but you never know with Villa. Either a 1-0 win, or a 2/3-0 loss.",0,1395940926,null,0,false,0,cgde8i4,t3_21i71x,t1_cgde8i4,t3_21i71x,null,1433094225,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2

You know what?  Being offended isn't nice, but you'll get over it.  You don't have to act like a victim of PTSD because someone said something you disagree with.

I'm an atheist and I regularly get into discussions on Reddit where people call me stupid or tell me I'm going to hell or whatever.  It actually does upset me, but even so - it's not going to induce mental illness and neither do I consider myself victim of a violent attack.

Having said that - I am appalled by bullying behavior online and I would like to see it reduced.  I think however that people are making a big mistake in conflating online threats + bullying with offensive speech.

true,rydleo,null,null,"For the group stage, the 32 teams are divided into 4 pots of 8 teams each.  Which pot you go in is determined by your UEFA coefficient, with the highest 7 that are in the competition (plus the previous years winner, if they are not one of them) going into Pot 1.  Pot 2 is teams ranked 9-16, Pot 3 is 17-24, Pot 4 is 25-32.  One team from each pot is drawn and placed into a group (Group A, Group B, C, D, etc.)  with the exception that 2 teams from the same league may not be placed into the same group.

As an example, for the current CL here were the pots (I think, going from some older notes on this):

Pot One: Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Chelsea, Real Madrid, Manchester United, Arsenal, FC Porto, Benfica.

Pot Two: Atletico Madrid, Shakhtar Donetsk, AC Milan, Schalke, Marseille, CSKA Moscow, PSG, Juventus

Pot Three: Zenit, Man City, Ajax, Borussia Dortmund, Basel, Olympiakos, Galatasaray, Leverkusen

Pot Four: FC Copenhagen, Napoli, Anderlecht, Celtic, Steaua Bucuresti, Viktoria Plzen, Real Sociedad, Austria Vienna

Although there has been a bit of a debate on this, I do think everyone would agree there is almost no chance of us being above Pot 3, which means we'd have to play 2 teams from Pots 1 and 2 in our Group.  For example, this season that could have meant something like Real Madrid and PSG.  On the flip side, we could get lucky and have drawn Benfica and Marseille.  

Any way you go about it though, playing in the CL will be brilliant and I just hope we can avoid finishing 4th in the league to avoid the qualification round.

EDIT:  I think the confusing part is that UEFA coefficients and rankings don't necessarily match up to 'the real world' or how good a club is necessarily.  So to see someone like PSG rated lower than the likes Benfica or BVB rated lower than CSKA is a bit weird.  It's easily arguable that on current form Liverpool is nowhere near the 32nd best team in Europe, but that's just the way the rankings work.

UEFA tries to make these groups fair and uniform in the best way they can. It wouldn't be fair if Bayern Munich, Chelsea, PSG, and Barcelona were all in the same group.

So instead of distributing the teams randomly, the teams are broken up into 4 pots, with the top 8 teams based on UEFA coefficient (which is how well the team has performed in Europe in the past 5 years, as well as a little bit how their country has performed) in pot 1, the next 8 in pot 2, and so on. Groups are drawn with one team from each pot, with the stipulation that two teams from the same country cannot be drawn together in the group stage.

Because we have been out of Europe for a while, and have not been stellar when we have been in it during the past 5 seasons, our ranking it currently 32, which means we are likely to make Pots 3 or 4 next season.

A rental car could be waiting for you in the mourning, drop you off at work and instead of sitting in a parking lot doing nothing all day it could pic up it's next customer.

Basically Sam gambled with our top flight status last summer with the way he handled his transfer business. He didn't strengthen the squad. Instead he threw all his eggs in Carroll's basket with a dash of Downing on the side to feed Andy. He gambled that Carroll would stay injury free. He gambled that the squad would remain injury free. And he lost. He lost miserably. It's by the sheer grit of our players that we're still in this league. Sam deserves severe criticism for the way he has handled his business this year. I don't think booing the team at the Boleyn is the best or indeed the proper way to express that criticism and frustration. The problem with booing is that it's the players who get hurt by it, and all they're doing is following his instructions. They're playing hard. They're just not playing well. That's Sam's fault. We continue to abuse their efforts and they might well just say 'fuck it', and I wouldn't blame them. They've fought hard and that they're charged to play in the manner they play is not their fault. They're doing their jobs. And for most of them it is a job. We want players to play for the shirt, but in the modern game that's a completely unrealistic expectation. It's a job. But with that being the case, for the most part our team has played for the shirt. And they have great chemistry, which is THE most important ingredient in having a successful team. The fans can kill that very quickly if they turn on the team. You can't buy chemistry.

IMO we need to vocally support the side right to the end of the season, and in return the club need to support us by bringing in a proper squad in the summer, a good squad, players that challenge the starters for a place in the side. Every position needs to be backed up. We need another striking option. We need enough good players to have more than one option tactically. We desperately need a plan B, but you can't have one if you don't have the personnel. I think a team properly staffed can play good football under Sam. If he can't get us a good squad this summer, the we need to put him on the clock. He won't get away with another season of play like this one. We'll get relegated. There are fan forums with the club where our concern can be expressed. Our owners maintain an open channel through social media.

https://ibwt.co.uk/ is the most well known (I think the creator hangs around here sometimes).
Like all UK based exchanges the biggest problem they come across is bank policy. As far as we can tell all UK banks are dumping companies operating as bitcoin exchanges because of the associated risk. Without a bank behind them an exchange really can't function.

IBWT gets round this using a company based in the Virgin Islands that acts as an intermediary (kind of like Paypal). This company however has tried to wipe its hands of bitcoin once already but u-turned shortly after. The situation with them now seems stable but I'm still not convinced about they're payment system.

They also accept cash and postal order as ways of accepting and making payments into and out of the exchange I think.

There are some other exchanges (or were, I suppose) that operated using dodgy Eastern European banks as Coinfloor is currently doing I think. As has happened before, these exchanges can just disappear over night (although I can't name a specific example off the top of my head).

I would still say that there isn't yet a *good* UK bitcoin exchange and judging by the uptake on IBWT, which is probably the best we have, so does everyone else.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"**My compendium of thoughts, replies from a number of recent threads on /r/soccer**

Because he doesn't wreak havoc when he drags wide, his distribution is woeful and he is shambolic with his back to goal. He fits a style of play where he gets his face towards goal and can run at defenders, but our buildup play is generally not direct enough to really make the most of this.

In a team like WBA who played direct football, often down the middle he shone, but most of our distribution comes from the flanks- and despite his size he is not overly effective (as I said, he is shit with his back to goal) with this. 

We need a player who can hold the ball up, latch onto crosses and either steal a shot off (like Victor used to do so often, even if they were wide 90% of the time), or work a pass to one of the on running midfielders (like Fellaini used to do when he was played in the advanced position). A guy with the attributes of Giroud would be perfect for us, as he would bring the wingers and whoever is in the hole in to work their magic far more than what Lukaku allows. 

He is clearly a talented player, but the way we play football just makes him look hugely ineffective most of the time. For me however this conversation is totally redundant, there is close to zero chance that we might be able to sign him with the money we have, and even if we could it would be a foolish decision, because for the £30m+ he would cost, we could improve every spot we need to, not just the one up top. 

---

I would prefer to get good value on a player who fits out play style whilst filling up the other gaps in the squad- we are not in the position where an all or nothing gamble is worth making in my opinion.

It seems that some Evertonians have been seduced by having this big name at the club, but look at the amount of games where he has really imposed himself and been an intrinsic element of us getting a win.. Those are few and far between- for £35m I would want him to be doing this game after game.

---

He is great when he has his face to goal, but bloody bad otherwise. 'Room to grow' doesn't mean he is good enough to lead the line for Chelsea- he really, really isn't.

His touch and technique is so poor, he can't pass for shit and makes a ton of errors on and off the ball. In super quick counter attacking teams that can get the ball to his feet when he is on a run, he will get a good amount of goals- but Mourinho is a man who wants his players to improve the play all over the pitch, which Lukaku will not, and can not do

---

Unless he is running at goal, he is utterly woeful on the ball. His passing and decision making with his back to goal is laughable- not something Mourinho will look kindly on.

Whilst he is a pretty amazing finisher, so is Ba- and he is not exactly loved by Mourinho.

---

Lukaku would be amazing in a team that play a long ball counter attacking style, but more possession based shorter ball games he has little to offer. In the right system he will be world class, no doubt- but for me that is not what Mourinho wants from a forward, he has focus on complete players who create for themselves and others, and Lukaku is a liability in that area.

I feel you might keep him, at least for next season- but unless he improves, he is always going to be a super sub type

---

In reply to Question *Hasn't Martinez changed the way Everton plays to a less direct and more short passing way? I may be wrong. How has Lukaku faired in that?*

Martinez has, and Lukaku has done somewhat poorly. He started out very strong, but as our style has progressed, he has regressed further and further. There are still games where he has been fantastic, but more often than not he is a liability. 

Games like Swansea, Sunderland, Stoke, Palace, Spurs and even Fulham where we have been pretty dominant- he has failed to latch onto the positive forward play that is being put in his direction, and when he did get on something in those games, he would lose it again more often than not. 

He is clearly a talented player, who does open the game up for others around him- but if the ball is not right to his feet he won't chase it, and he is rarely seen making an active attempt to close down with the rest of the team. 

As it stands we are certainly a better side with him in the team, but that is as much of a case of the lack of quality we have- rather than how good he is. 

On /r/Everton there are still a few people who think we should try to sign him, but 95% of the subreddit would be pretty against it unless we got him at some crazy markdown price (which will never happen).

I think of his as the opposite Giroud, everything Lukaku does well Giroud does poorly and visa versa. Giroud is amazing with his back to goal, he will pick passes to the midfielders running in and be an asset in the build up... He will however miss chances and has been shown to lack that killer goalscorers instinct, who frailties that cannot be put on Lukaku. 

---

He is a poacher/ direct forward disguised as a target man- tracking back is just not something he will ever do. 

Looking on Whoscored at some games (not cherrypicked) you can see the issue. Vs Norwich (a game we dominated and won 2-0) he had 26 passes (the lowest on the team) with an accuracy of 54% (by far the lowest on the team), to put this in some perspective, the second lowest passing rate was Barry with 85%. Lukaku also had zero tackles, zero possession recoveries, zero interceptions.. Yet still managed to foul twice.

Against Fulham, he had the lowest number of passes, and lowest passing accuracy- again zero defensive stats yet only managed no goals and 2 shots on target in a game we won 4-1.

Against Spurs earlier in the year we were just getting run over in the first half, but the gaffer made some changes and we really got back into it after half time.. Once again though Lukaku was worse than anonymous for the entirety. Aside from once again poor passing and defensive stats, he had zero shots on goal- whilst we only had 8 as a team... for a lone centre forward to get zero of them you have to ask questions. 

Aside from the stats, he has scored some important goals for us and had some good performances- but this horrible level of inconsistency and bad workrate is not going to cut it at Chelsea. That is why I would be surprised if he was anything more than a bench warmer next season... If I am honest I think he will be sold for big money before teams begin to realise he couldn't be further away from being the next Drogba. 

As I have said elsewhere, deliver a ball into him in the right area- and you have a goal. He is stunningly quick, but also will win any foot race with a smaller, fester defender because of his strength. If he gets goalside on a defender, there is nothing they can do to stop his run- and he will usually shake them off before getting his shot away. This is an amazing attitude in an attacking game where the sides are stretched, but Chelsea will more often than not be a side who is pushing against a defensive wall... Where Lukaku is all but useless. 

---

Carroll is currently a much better player than Lukaku. West Ham require a target man who is good in the air (which Lukaku is, but not as good as Carroll) and will hold up the ball (which Lukaku is not capable of).
West Ham are far too wing-centric for Lukaku to work, and whilst they do have a counter attacking focused style- distribution generally goes to the flanks.
A team like Spurs, Villa or Newcastle would allow Lukaku to shine- and I would not be too shocked if Spurs went in for him over the summer if he did come up for sale.

The main reason that Nick Clegg fell from from grace was because, despite losing seats, the Lib Dems still had enough MPs to form a coalition.

Not to mention losing the ""protest vote"" by entering into government.  
  
The only way I can imagine a similar thing happening with Farage would be if Ukip win any seats at the next election (with Farage himself winning a seat too), and got enough MPs to form a coalition (with a party that is hated by Ukip supporters) that resulted in Farage having to vote for stuff he'd said he was against.

* Man City join the elite group of thrashing Arsenal. #WengerOut starts trending on twitter.
* Shelvey earns Swansea a draw against Chelsea with a cracking goal
* Liverpool beat Man City at Anfield. 
* Agent Borini eats his hand off while celebrating a hattrick against Man City to make it back to back losses for them. 
* Suarez shares his secret with Daniel Sturridge and Steven Gerrard in the dressing room before the Norwich match and the match ends 10-3. They each get a hattrick. Skrtel overheard their conversation in the dressing room and put 3 own goals past Mignolet. Phillipe Coutinho finally scores from a tame shot outside the box. John Ruddy announces his retirement.
* A one-handed Borini does it again by scoring a brace to beat Chelsea and get out the bottom 3 for the first time in weeks. The fans at the Stadium of Light singing to keep him post-summer.
* Liverpool's unbeaten run is halted at Anfield against Chelsea. Jose's pre-match comments that 'the Referee's Association wants Liverpool to win the league' must've stuck in the mind of the ref as he calls 2 Suarez goals offside wrongly. In the last minute of the game he awards Eto a penalty. Only Eto knows why it was a penalty but he forgot due to his acute dementia.
* Everton does Merseyside proud. They beat Man City. 
* The last gameday of the season starts off with Liverpool in 1st with 83 pts, Chelsea 2nd with 82 pts and City 3rd with 81 pts

&gt;This has encouraged brave young men and women in western Ukraine to rebel to the point of toppling a legitimate president and led to the utterly predictable debacle whereby Vladimir Putin has annexed part of the country and now casts a long shadow over hopes of genuine democracy in the rest of it.

&gt;**I do not support what Putin has done – of course I don’t.** But the approach of David Cameron, William Hague, Nick Clegg and other EU leaders has been disastrous. If you poke the Russian bear with a stick he will respond. And if you have neither the means nor the political will to face him down that is very obviously not a good idea...

&gt;The British public were already fed up of being dragged into conflicts where no pressing national interest was at stake. I know many people are, like me, now deeply worried about weak and vain leaders allowing an expectation to grow up that European countries such as Britain will always side with uprisings in the naive belief that benevolent liberal democracy is bound to replace existing regimes, fundamentally imperfect as they are. That is not the way the world works. So I repeat the charge: the EU has blood on its hands.

                                                                 Nigel Farage 27/3/14

http://www.ukip.org/nigel_farage_steps_up_his_criticism_of_reckless_eu_foreign_policy

He merely points out, *what do you think was going to happen when an ever expanding, Barroso-described EU empire, customs union moved to border and enclose on a second customs union headed by Putin?*

And let us not forget the likes EU representatives HAVE found themselves siding with:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-zuK_gfQn8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m

Straight after Nick Clegg's radio programme this morning, just before the news, LBC had a Foreign Policy-Ukraine expert on and they followed up on Clegg's post-match discussion on Farage's EU foreign policy stance.  There was an awkward moment when their 'expert' began to admit that actually Farage was correct, and that the EU Eastern Partnership programme had directly enabled a coup of a democratically elected government which had allowed the Svoboda Party to assume government seats unelected, and which had given Putin an excuse for annexation, if not yet a casus belli. 

Svoboda are now a heartbeat away from the presidency with a VP, control the agriculture and ecology ministries, and they have their man in as General Prosecutor.

None of this would have happened if it weren't for EU meddling, and the irony is that it is extremely unlikely that Ukraine could have ever joined the EU (they're so poor they make Romania look positively affluent).

--------------

And the Ukraine has just secured an IMF bailout with *record* austerity measures doubling heating costs and halving all state pensions.  Crimea on the other hand has just had its pensions tripled and will be getting an energy subsidy from Russia.   So well done EU.  Well done.  If this doesn't result in the oil rich Eastern Ukraine which are predominantly Russian speakers breaking away with Crimea leaving the EU with a huge West Ukraine millstone around its neck you'll be very lucky.

Pot 1 | Pot 2 | Pot 3 | Pot 4

Man U | Valencia | Tottenham | Rubin Kazan
||AC Milan |Marseille | CSKA Moskow
||Lyon |
||Inter |

Which means that *even if* we're in pot 3, pot 1 and 2 might be a bit weaker this year than normal. Would be pots without these 10 teams, assuming everyone qualifies for the group stages in numerical order (and removing teams that can't qualify due to their country's allocations coming up, e.g. AZ can't because PSV and Ajax qualify):

Pot 1 | Pot 2 | Pot 3 | Pot 4
------|------|-----|-----

Real (ESP) | Dortmund (GER) | Olympiacos (GRE) | Athletic (ESP)

Atheltico (ESP)| Basel (SUI) | Sporting (POR) | Celtic (SCO)
Porto (POR)| Man City (ENG) | Dynamo Kiev (UKR) | Monaco (FRA)

I think we can't be drawn against other English sides, so that means we'd be likely to face one of Barca, Real, Bayern (all difficult!), Benfica or Porto (think we could win these) from Pot 1, anyone but City from Pot 2 and everyone from Pot 4. Fun fact, Monaco don't appear to have a coefficient.

From Pot 2 I think we'd only need to worry about Dortmund, PSG and Juventus, and from Pot 4 only Roma and Monaco. I'd say the odds are in our favour for getting out of the group, though unlikely for us to win the group.

(This took a lot longer to put together than I thought, it was only meant to be a bit of a glance.)

Edit: Athletic are 5 points behind us atm. Their number of points will go up as at least 1 Spanish team will make it to the semi-finals, though I don't know if it'll go up enough in order to over take us. Sport almost definitely will with having two teams in the Europea league quarters (I'd expect at least Benfica to win their ties). So hopefully, even if Athletic over takes us, we'll *just* scrape into pot 3 at the bottom, so we might end up with the following instead:

&gt;i) Ignore them. This is often a very good strategy. If you don't like a book in a library, then don't read it.

&gt;ii) Challenge them. Put forward your own argument. Explain why you think they're wrong. Use debate. Do what we do on Reddit. The best counter to a bad argument is a good argument.

People do not argue that Page 3, for example, should be banned for being offensive. They argue it should because it is oppressive, which is not the same thing. In fact, the thing that's so pernicious about Page 3 from a feminist perspective is how blandly inoffensive it actually is. I don't agree with banning it, but you are misrepresenting the reason why people want to.

There are times when a ""good argument"" is not good enough - to stick with the feminist angle, the suffragettes spring to mind. 

Alternatively, we could turn to Orwell's critique of pacifism, ""Despotic governments can stand 'moral force' till the cows come home; what they fear is physical force."" 

&gt;We need to be able to discuss controversial ideas and to understand that it's impossible to do so without sometimes causing offense.

Does it aid the discussion of controversial ideas if one side may use pre-existing social hierarchies to silence dissent with verbal bullying using the racial and gendered slurs 'free speech' types defend? Ditto if conservative forces are able to amplify their perspectives - and ostracise others - using the media that they own? Or does it simply allow a retrenchment and perpetuation of the existing uncontroversial way of things?

The point to that being: free speech is an important principle, but the liberal conception of it is deeply deeply naive. There is not simple answer to any of this.

CB - 2 positions - Agger Skrtel Sakho Toure Ilori 

   - I hope Ilori can come in for Toure as he's shown he's not starting XI quality. I also have the feeling we'll sell one of Skrtel or Agger. That means we'd need to purchase one first team CB. 

FB - 2 positions - Johnson Enrique Flannagan 

   - these are our only three starting FBs. This leaves one spot for either wisdom or Kelly, but I have a feeling Kelly will be sold, Wisdom isn't ready and we'll buy someone to compete for that last spot. But who knows what Brendan's thinking. I've been known to write off players too soon (Sterling, Flannagan)

CM - 3 positions - Gerrard Henderson Coutinho Allen Lucas Alberto

   - not sure Alberto is up for a regular place in the team next year. That means we'd need one purchase for central midfield, or more if anyone's sold. 

Forwards - 3 positions - Suarez Sturridge Sterling

   - 3 quality players for those three positions obviously isn't enough. To fill the gaps we have Aspas, Ibe, Assaidi, Borini. None of these four have shown they can be relied upon. I have faith Ibe and maybe one of Borini or Aspas will come good. That means we'd need one or two quality signings up front. 


TL;DR we need to buy one CB, one FB, one CM, and one Forward to hold our place in the league and compete confidently in Europe. More signings if we sell players.

Below is a list of what the Clegg and his ilk have enabled the Tories to do:

* NHS - Health and Social Care Act 2012
Thanks to Liberal Democrat votes they must share responsibility for wasting £3billion on a top-down NHS reorganisation while more people wait longer in A&amp;Es and over 5,000 nurses are cut.

* Tuition Fees: Trebling Tuition Fees to £9000 (despite promising to abolish them.

* Educational Maintenance Allowance (EMA)
Lib Dems helped Tories abolish it

* Abolished ESA

* Snoopers charter

* Bedroom Tax:
(Spare Room Subsidy) Voted with the Tories to charge poor people between £14 and £24.00 PER WEEK inflicting distress and suffering on millions, now over 50,000 people are in rent arrears and face eviction and the figures will continue to increase.

* Privatisation of Probation Service

* VAT BOMBSHELL:
In opposition Clegg &amp; Lib dems spoke of ""TORY VAT BOMBSHELL"" then voted with Tories to increase VAT to 20%

* Part Privatisation of prison service

* Bombing Syria:
Voted/supported With Tories to bomb Syria

* Sure Start Centers:
Supported Tories to close over 558 Sure Start Centres (so far) despite promising not to,

* Cut Income Tax for Millionaires:
Backed a Tory cut in the top rate of tax, giving 13,000 millionaires a tax cut worth an average £100,000 while millions are paying more.

* Falling Living Standards:
Clegg says he's making life ""fairer and easier"" with tax cuts, however, wages are down £1,500 since the election and a million young people out of work.

* Mansion Tax:
Nick Clegg said ""The Mansion Tax is right, it makes sense and the Liberal Democrats will continue to make the case for it. they said they would ""stick to their guns"" however when given the chance to stand up for their own principles and vote for a mansion tax, Liberal Democrat MPs voted against it.

* Constitutional Reform:
Nick Clegg said his constitutional reform programme would be ""the biggest shake-up of our democracy since the Great Reform Act of 1832"". It wasn't. He abandoned Lords reform after Conservative MPs refused to back it, and he failed to deliver reform of the voting system.

* Police:
In the Liberal Democrat manifesto, Nick Clegg promised to put 3,000 more police on the beat. But in Government they backed Tory plans to cut more than 15,000 police officers.

* Special Advisers:
In opposition, the Liberal Democrats said that special advisers ""are political jobs, and should, therefore, be funded by political parties"". They changed their tune when they got into Government. Nick Clegg alone has sixteen Special Advisers - paid for at the taxpayers' expense.

* Foodbanks:
Soaring use of foodbanks

* Utilities:
Soaring cost of gas, electricity and water.

* Child Poverty:
There are now 2.6million kids in the UK being brought up in hardship, with more than half of them in working households. The number of children living in poverty has leapt by 300,000 under the Coalition Government.

* Environment:
Meant to be ""greenest"" government ever, but helping Tories introduce Fracking

* Lobbying Bill:
Not one single Liberal Democrat MP opposed the party of the government’s draconian Lobbying Bill that muzzles charities and campaigners.

* Secret Courts:
In an Act of Parliament Liberal Democrat MPs voted in favour of Secret Courts and helped put on the statute books just five months ago! Now they have the cheek to say they will repeal it? Then why vote it through? Is this what Clegg calls blocking the excesses of the Tories? Voting something through then saying they will repeal it?

* Legal Aid:
Liberal Democrats voted with the Tories to stop ordinary people gaining access to legal aid;

* Judicial Review:
The curtailing of judicial review.

* Workers Rights:
Removing workers rights to a tribunal and charging them at least £1000 to bring a case",0,1395950333,null,0,1395951181,0,cgdj614,t3_21fpg1,t1_cgdj614,t1_cgd5r4r,null,1433096547,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,specofdust,scot-Highlands,Pasty Faced Haggis Rider,"&gt;Except that's not what happened, the snipers were seemingly under the orders of the protesters.

No. A leaked Estonian call suggests they *may* have been under orders from the other parties. That does not invalidate the protestors desires even if it *is* true, which, given the tosh Estonia has been coming out with recently, and the fact that they said ""may"", means absolutely nothing.

&gt;You do know that the most prominent rebel leaders are literal nazis and that upon gaining power one of the first things they did was to start banning languages within Ukraine?

Firstly, Svoboda are not nazis. They're hard right, that's for sure, but to call them nazis is absurd. Secondly, no languages were banned, and saying such a thing means you're either ignorant or lying. There was a motion to remove Russian as a state language, that is **not** the same as banning any languages, nor was it passed as the president vetod it. Finally, regardless ofi any of this, that makes no difference to whether or not the protesters were legitimately overthrowing a corrupt government which killed them for protesting.

&gt;That would be like an independent Scotland making Gaelic it's sole official language despite the majority of people in most regions not being able to speak it at all!

No, it wouldn't, because only a tiny number of people in Scotland speak Gaelic. The majority of Ukrainians speak Ukrainian, and there was never any intention to stop Russian speakers speaking Russian, just to make the national langauge of Ukraine, Ukrainian.

&gt;They are armed fascist thugs, ""One nation, one people, one country. A clean nation. Ukraine will be just for Ukrainians"". 

Ah so if a tiny minority of people who protest in a mass protest have views you don't like that invalidates the entire protest does it?

&gt;And you want to tell me that they were ""peacefully protesting""? You did see the footage of them burning buildings for days prior to any gunfire, right?

Burning barricades, sure. The police were repeatedly trying to remove them from the square by beating up protesters and gassing them, they resisted this, and they also resisted the ban on protesting. So what?

&gt;We clearly always had ""interests"" but enough info has been leaked to make that conclusion unavoidable. 

Oh wow, convinced by some random youtube video and *you* think *others* are succumbing to propaganda. That's hilarious.

&gt;We also recognize Iraq and Afghanistan's governments, both from elections performed while under a far more unpopular military occupation than Russia's recent acquisition.

It's not about popularity, it's about safeguarding the rights of minorities, having a free and fair election which is well organised and not just slammed down right after a region of a country has been forcibly invaded.

&gt;Double standards much? Who's the one that's expanding territory?

BTLers need someone to pay their mortgages for them.

&gt; What makes you think it's an effortless income?

What makes you think it's so difficult? Every time I've rented, the actual management is hived off to some management company, the landlord attempts to ignore anything that requires them to do or pay for anything (but the contract will be followed to the letter in regards to money going toward them), and as long as they're getting their inflated rent (and this is from personal experience of living in Reading), you won't see them after you move in.

&gt; Owning social housing is far less profitable than private housing.

Yet profitable enough to do it - and practically guaranteed funding to boot from an organisation that is unlikely to stop paying. Yes, it must be terrible.

&gt; Councils chose not to own it themselves, would you rather no one provided housing to councils?

I'd rather that scummy landlords weren't the major providers of social housing. Whether that takes bold political steps and government funding to get building proper council housing stock or not. I'd even go as far as to see the demolition of the BTL industry.

The fact that councils currently take the easy route of handing billions of pounds of taxpayer cash to landlords in return for temporary use of a property, doesn't mean that the council is doing the right thing, nor does it make  you benevolent and altruistic.

And if you look at their actions and who was being shot at it confirms that they were taking shots at the police as well. They were there to ""up the ante"" so to speak. 

&gt; given the tosh Estonia has been coming out with recently

An EU nation with full NATO membership. Hardly a voice of Russia. 

&gt; Svoboda are not nazis. They're hard right, that's for sure, but to call them nazis is absurd. 

[Yes they absolutely 100% are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svoboda_%28political_party%29#Allegations_of_neo-nazism_and_political_extremism). That officially makes you a Nazi apologist. How does that make you feel? 

&gt; Secondly, no languages were banned, and saying such a thing means you're either ignorant or lying. There was a motion to remove Russian as a state language, that is not the same as banning any languages, nor was it passed as the president vetod it. 

Yes it is, removal of any ""official"" status means it gets removed from the education system. 

&gt; legitimately overthrowing a corrupt government which killed them for protesting.

And throwing motivs at the police &amp; burning down buildings. With the killings from unidentified snipers who were also shooting at the police. And you have the cheek to say I'm either lying or ignorant?

&gt; The majority of Ukrainians speak Ukrainian

About two thirds, a very slender ""majority"".

&gt; The majority of Ukrainians speak Ukrainian, and there was never any intention to stop Russian speakers speaking Russian, just to make the national langauge of Ukraine, Ukrainian.

Thus removing it from all government forms and the education system. From people who openly say they want to ethnically cleanse the country of Russians. But, not Nazi, right? ;-)

&gt; Burning barricades, sure. 

Em, no. Seek out the wide angle shots of the square, most of the surrounding buildings were torched.

I bet your attitude was different when it was London that was burning not so long ago.  

&gt; and they also resisted the ban on protesting. So what?

We have the same bans. We too remove people from protests. Do you think a revolution is an acceptible response when it happens at an anti-G8 protest? The Occupy protests? How do you think that would have gone down had the tents been known to be storing assault rifles and firebombs? If you need a clue, look to Belfast. 

It's amazing how you so easily vilify another nation for doing things no differently from how we respond to the same situation.

&gt; convinced by some random youtube video and you think others are succumbing to propaganda

Ok, if we're going to talk about this you're going to have to stop referring to the entire protest movement of hundreds of thousands of people, and opposition government where 1% of the people voted for actual extreme right wingers, as facists. It's incredibly disrespectful, it's a lie, and I'm not prepared to discuss the issue if you're going to continue to willfully misrepresent the entire opposition movement as such.

I'm not sure what your definitions of sudden or decisive are, but Euromaidan took over 4 months of protesting and was *anything* but decisive. There were many, many occasions where it seemed like the entire protest movement was going to get crushed by the government.

You can't really prepare for a draw apart the 0-0 one and for that you need to park the bus. And Arsenal couldn't park the bus against Swansea for f sake! 

So it boils down to two choices:

- risky, but extremelly good for the morale if it goes well - go for the win.

- safer, but not that safe, because City have one of or even the best attack in the league and bad for the morale: go for 0-0.

Wenger knows that he needs to kick some spark into the team, at least for the cup game(s). Winning the City game might be that spark, while loosing won't be that much worse than drawing, unless they lose again with gazillions to nil.

There were certainly police shot, there were certainly protestors shot. Whether by the same people, it is hard to say. Who sent them is entirely unknown and you taking some speculation by some random Estonian ministers as hard proof that this was some sort of opposition government led provocation is absurd.

&gt;An EU nation with full NATO membership. Hardly a voice of Russia. 

I never said it was. But I myself would concede as anyone lacking information would that people who shot police *may* have been sent by the opposition. Not knowing, I can not discount the possibility entirely. What you're doing though is you're taking the fact that, we simply do not know who sent them, and taking that as hard evidene that they were Ukrainian opposition because it supports your position.

&gt;Yes it is, removal of any ""official"" status means it gets removed from the education system. 

From the state education system, sure. That is not the same as banning it. There are many, many countries which have minority languages in them where the state expects schooling to be carried out in the official language of that state. The UK did it for much of the 20th century.

&gt;And throwing motivs at the police &amp; burning down buildings.

I'd hardly call Berkut police personally, but whatever. Yes, molotovs were thrown at police who were trying to forcibly remove protesters from Maidan. That's how revolution works, so what? A poeple who live under an oppressive regieme have the moral and political right to reject the authority of that regieme.

&gt;And you have the cheek to say I'm either lying or ignorant?

Where have I lied?

Right. [A majority.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/UkraineNativeLanguagesCensus2001detailed-en.png)

&gt;Thus removing it from all government forms and the education system. From people who openly say they want to ethnically cleanse the country of Russians. But, not Nazi, right? ;-)

Sorry, which people are you referring to?

&gt;We have the same bans. We too remove people from protests. 

We don't stick people in jail for 4 years for protesting.

&gt;It's amazing how you so easily vilify another nation for doing things no differently from how we respond to the same situation.

We don't systematically murder protesters, we don't criminalise protesting, and *even if we did*, that wouldn't make what happened in Ukraine any less bad. Whataboutism isn't going to get you out of this argument.

&gt;Are you trolling me? Honest question, because I don't believe anyone could be so ignorant yet confident in their ramblings.

I never said those elections had been that, I said that that was the important issue. Again, whataboutism.

&gt;And NATO just ""annexed"" another nation on Russia's doorstop.

Oh bullshit. No-one joins NATO by being invaded and then told they're now part of NATO. This is absolutely absurd. I can not believe you're actually comparing the voluntary joining of a security alliance by sovereign nations to the annexation of the territory of a country.

I wouldn't be referring to them as that if there weren't a far higher number of their leadership taken from bona fide fascists. Yes, not all of them are but a notable and influential percentage are. Those that weren't seemed perfectly happy to literally stand alongside those that were Nazis.

Lol.

I'm ready for the bloody weekend, like you wouldn't believe. I was told this week that, because a bloke in the group of workers I came in with has a sacked it off I am to be moved to his old team, because there's 2 of us in my current team. Not much of a problem on the face of it but:

* I don't want to move teams

* My team don't want me to move

* My new team doesn't want me

* This round I'm to be moved to is, bluntly put, a **SHITHOLE**. Basically we get kicked out of the van with a roll of bags and a litter picker. On my current round I don't think anybody has ever managed to use more than 3/4s of a roll of bags during a day, it's unlikely that we'd even use a roll over two days depending on which roads we're doing. The one I'm moving to you're likely to see a roll get done in just the morning. 

I don't see why it's not more sensible to move a guy with more experience (so the new team don't whinge about having to ""babysit"") who has no set team move to that team. Makes a shit job worse.

The job is hanging by a thread anyway, of course doing it is utter piss but then the teams are just catty, whiny, and bitchy. Got the two senior guys who'd rather say things about you quietly to other people when you're away than they would say it to you when you're right there. Not just bitchy things and jokes at your expense, but actual advice that would help you do your job better. Ridiculous, meant to be grown men! Then I get the people I live with making everything around here as awkward as they can.

I've not played guitar enough so now I'm worse than I used to be an struggle with shit that used to be simple for me, that makes me feel very low.

Suarez shoots the ball, curling into the top corner, BAMM! the keeper punches the ball, the ball drops, a defender clears the ball out of the penalty area! about halfway between the D and the center circle, you see Gerarrd running towards the ball, the ball is going to drop right in front of him, we all know whats coming. We all know this is what we had been waiting for. 

The ball hits the ground, Gerrard unleashes a half volley, the ball flies like a bullet, everything is in slow motion. You can see everyone's heads turning towards the path of the ball zooming towards the top right corner. Suarez already has his hands in the air, he's scored so many amazing goals, he can tell from the path of the ball that its going in and the keeper can do nothing about it. The ball smashes into the back of the net. The noise is deafening. Anfield goes wild, we have scored more goals than anyone, more goals than City. The goal difference is the same but we have SCORED MORE GOALS. WE HAVE WON THE LEAGUE.

well, not just yet, there is still 40 seconds more to go.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"&gt;Do you think, for example, members of the BNP should be allowed to join the Police?

That's a fair question, but it is a borderline case.  The reason we're sensitive about the police is because they have power over us.

Instead of giving you a knee-jerk response, I think that in this case I'd have to look at the arguments carefully in order to decide.

In general though - I think people should not be discriminated against because they hold unpopular political opinions.  That doesn't mean that I think their opinions can't be challenged - only that, as long as someone's opinions is not interfering with their work, I think it would be wrong to  deny that person employment on the basis that I disagree with their worldview.

It's not dissimilar from the arguments over 'religious freedom'.  Personally I find much of Islam to be highly objectionable, but I would find it still more objectionable to deny Muslims rights because of their beliefs.

But, I don't care.  

Your personal philosophical opinions about feminist doctrine are of no particular interest to me, because I don't share your views.

It's like hearing a Catholic trying to explain his/her Church's position about stem-cell research.  The only people who care are other Catholics, because Catholic arguments are essentially meaningless if you're not part of the same church.

That doesn't mean you're wrong, only that if you want to convince others you will have to use reasons which don't depend on any particular ideology.

true,TheKingMonkey,,"""short Jack &amp; sides""","**Q1:** I'm genuinely surprised how far off the pace Moyes has been. I think we all know he wasn't left with a vintage United squad and that could have been for any number of reasons (oddly lack of investment from the Glazers hasn't really been talked about much, outside of Man Utd circles at least) and while the squad needs an overhaul you would have imagined that Manchester United would at least be above the likes of Everton and Spurs in the table. 

**Q2:** I think Manchester United will finish 6th or 7th in the table this season. I fear for them in the Champions League, while anything can happen in cup football I fully expect Bayern to win comfortably. 

**Q3:** I'll get slaughtered for this, but I'm quite enjoying the drama at Old Trafford. You see this is part of football, there are generations of Man Utd fans who have never known what it is like to have ups and downs, You'd have to be over 35 years of age to remember the last time United finished outside of the top three and probably over 40 to remember the last time United changed their manager.  Football is supposed to be about ups and downs and lets face it, the ""up"" period Manchester United have had has lasted since the FA cup win in 1990. 

**Q4:** Benteke's second season has been odd to say the least. He started the season like a runaway train scoring 5 goals in his first 5 appearances but then he got injured against Norwich in our 6th game and that seemed to do more damage to his season than anybody expected. It was clear for all to see that we brought him back into the team while he wasn't fully fit but even after that he spent a couple of months moping around like a player who didn't want to be here.  

He's picked up of late though, he's scored six in his last ten which is very good considering he is in a team who don't create very many chances. There have been some good performances too, West Brom at home was exceptional even though he only scored once.  He is very important to us tactically but I think we will have to get used to life without him. He will be off in the summer I think, especially if he has a good World Cup. 

**Q5:** Bertrand has been a good signing for us, even if it is just so he keeps Joe Bennett out of the team.  I'd like him to stay but it depends on what Chelsea ask for him. I can't see us dropping more than £5m on a left back given our current financial plight. 

**Q6:** The jury is still out on Lambert. I want to like him, I really do but the home form has been terrible ever since he took the job. For every win over Chelsea or Man City there has been a dreadful defeat to Crystal Palace or Stoke City. The 8-0 loss at Stamford Bridge last season was a club record defeat in all competitions, that stung I can tell you, but the thing is I'm not sure who could do better than Lambert given the restrictions he has to work under. These last five years or so have hammered home to me just how budget related the league table is. When we had a top six budget we were a top six team. Now we can't afford that we are down there with the dead men. Oh for an oligarch who thinks the second city is under represented at football's top table! 

**Q7:** Not really, but then I get paid to transport people to Wembley Stadium so I'm not really the right person to ask. 

**Q8:** Our entire team are so young that a lot of them still probably have to be home before it's dark! We will go through this season without fielding a player who is in his thirties which might be a club record. Grealish is the latest great white hype, but will he be the new David Platt or the new Barry Bannan? Too early to tell and we have had too many false dawns with our youth setup. A lot of players make it to the first team but they tend not to take the league by storm. Southampton we aint. 

**Q9:** Best signing is Leandro Bacuna without a shadow of a doubt, I think he has already reached the status of cult hero. Worst? Grant fucking Holt. Yuck. 
 
**Q10:** The team has been pretty settled of late. 4-3-3, Guzan in goals, a back four of Bacuna, Vlaar, Baker and Bertrand. Midfield is KEA, Westwood and Delph. Gabby, Weimann and Benteke up front. 

**Q11:** Aston Villa do not beat Manchester United. You know that. I know that. We all know that. 3-0 home win. Giggs to score. ",0,1395955903,null,0,false,0,cgdm155,t3_21i71x,t1_cgdm155,t3_21i71x,null,1433097957,3,false,avfc,t5_2s569,3

Whilst he is less deadly by a long way with his eyes on the prize, we don't get out forwards into that position nearly enough. 

For me a player with the technical aspects of Giroud would be perfect, except... you know.. a Giroud who can finish. His work in the build up play is stunning, his touch and technique allow the midfielders to operate with absolute freedom, which is something Lukaku hinders somewhat. He misses too many sitters though.

As a more realistic target I am absolutely gutted we didn't get Shane Long. he has technique, speed, strength and a good footballing mind. In the right system (ie. ours) I think he would become a leading PL player. 

On a more traditional target man though, I would have loved Bony- but we got Kone instead... sigh.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"The benefit of the central winger is that when they drift wide (and unlike Lennon, Chadli is just as adept at drifting left or right), they don't get followed by the opposition CDM, because almost all teams adopt the approach of conceding space on the wings in order to remain compact in the middle of the pitch.  A wide player will happily follow his man inside, but an inside man will often not follow his player wide.  And if he does, it's perfectly set up for a clever player (such as Eriksen) to come inside into the newly created hole.

Atletico Madrid are basically set up in this sort of way, with Luis, Turan and Koke all moving wide left and creating overloads out there.  Di Maria played the central winger role brilliantly in the first half of the most recent Clasico, setting up the first two goals, and could've easily created more had Benzema finished better.

I would be a huge advocate of playing Chadli as a central winger against Liverpool this weekend.  Gerrard is the key man we need to stifle, because we will not cope with Suarez and Sturridge once they're getting the ball in key areas.  Gerrard's distribution is key.  Chadli's got the pace and physical presence to shut down Gerrard, and when we're in possession, Gerrard will not follow him to either flank if he drifts wide.

I like the idea of Eriksen starting left too, and drifting inside as Chadli moves wide.  Hopefully with enough interchanging movement between them and whoever the third midfield attacker is (Townsend or Lennon), we'll find some space between the Liverpool backs and midfielders, and create some overloads.",0,1395957895,null,0,false,0,cgdmzju,t3_21j3bw,t1_cgdmzju,t3_21j3bw,null,1433098407,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

There was also things in the flat that we apparently didn't tidy (ie, blankets and socks that weren't ours) that somehow got there and made their way into the video. We only got our deposit back because they submitted wrongly dated invoices to the SafeDeposits people so it was a stroke of luck. I know two groups who didn't get their deposit back at all, not for lack of trying.

However! As long as you cover your back like that they really are worth it. Flats are in good condition, good furniture and they have a 24/7 service for if there's an emergency. They'll have any problems fixed in no time, and they can be pretty lenient with the rent if you need to be a few days late for whatever reason. They actually got a plumber out for our boiler on New Years Day. All in all they were great, besides the deposit thing.

By entering administration during the 2006–07 season, they hoped to avoid starting the 2007–08 season on −10 points.

Q2: 7th place, and unfortunately lose against Bayern. 

Q3: it's silly. Those fans should learn how to handle losing better. If you think you have it bad, look at us. And we don't even have it that bad either, Cardiff, Fulham, Wolves. 

Q4: He's been rubbish this season. He's been a bit on and off. When he is on, he is good, but when he is off, he is terrible. Hopefully he will turn up for the øast few games, increase his price and the interest around him so that we can get a decent sum for him after the World Cup. Unfortunately, I think he'll still be here though. 

Q5: Bertrand has been ok, a lot better than what we had (Luna) at least. I would be happy for him to stay, but I have a feeling that we haven't seen the last of Joe Bennett. He had a great game against Chelsea, and I was hoping we could give him a chance to prove himself, rather than develop a new player for Chelsea. I don't want players and managers to look at us as a stepping stone in their career. Loan is in my eyes for emergencies only. Last season we were struggling against relegation. That would be the time to loan Bertrand, not now.

Q6: I was quite confident that he was the man, but I'm not so sure anymore. I want to give him another season. By the end of next season, of we're not at the level Southampton/Newcastle is today, I think it's time to look for other options. 

Q7: Yes!

Q8: Carruthers and Grealish, and to a certain extent Jordan Graham. Graham has been a bit unlucky with injuries, so I think it'll take some more time before we'll see him. The other two will offer us some desperately needed creative options up front. 

Q9: I don't think it's fair to call the worst signing, as Bacuna is the only one to be given a chance to prove himself. That would also make him the best one, by default. The potentially best I think would be Okore or Helenius. 

Q10: Guzan - Bennett, Clark, Vlaar, Lowton - Gabby, Delph, Westwood, Albrighton - Weimann, Benteke

I ought to be able to defend any part of my comment without referencing any political ideology or religious notion.  Instead, I am choosing to use *reason*.

For instance:

People should have a right to an opinion because otherwise we would be in the business of becoming thought-police and no-doubt the least popular opinions would be punished first.

And why should we allow people to have unpopular opinions?  Partly  because we simply can't tell if today's unpopular opinion will, in the future, be one day accepted as a brilliant idea.  There is also the argument that it benefits society more for people to be able to express themselves, knowing that some of that expression will be bad speech, than it does to curtail freedom of speech.  Free-speech societies have empirically produced more happiness, more freedom and more wealth than closed, autocratic societies.

And feel free to disagree with the above, but perhaps you can at least accept that it was possible for me to communicate those ideas without appeal to any particular ideological framework. 

Compare the above style with your statement that 'the thing that's so pernicious about Page 3 from a feminist perspective...'

true,backtowriting,null,null,"Interesting and valid question.  If I can rephrase:  Don't bad ideas end up limiting the freedom of others because of their pernicious influence on society?

You know what?  To an extent they probably do.  If people constantly use slurs to describe my ethnicity then it is arguably limiting my freedom to enjoy my life free of slurs.

But you could also argue that your bank manager's refusal to give you a million dollars is an infringement on your freedom to enjoy being wealthy.  It's never ending!

People have conflicting needs and desires so it's impossible to ensure that everyone gets their own way.  The best we can do is to try to maximize freedom and happiness for everyone, knowing that some people will always get upset.

In the 'world of ideas' the best solution I've seen is the concept that, as much as possible, everyone should be given free speech.  Some of that speech will be bad and some will be hurtful, but note that in this system, free speech also gives victims the tools to fight back and minorities who have unpopular opinions are given the freedom to state those opinions without fear of imprisonment.

Free speech is also well suited to the discovery of new knowledge and *progress*.  Since we can't know which of today's unpopular ideas will ultimately turn out to be correct, it makes sense to allow that everyone should have the freedom to express any idea.  Limiting free speech would almost certainly result in banning unpopular speech and history has shown us that many ideas which were once deeply unpopular actually turned out to be right.  Homosexual equality springs to mind.  Other examples include equal rights for women and blacks.  

I hope I'm not an ideologue about these matters.  If someone comes up with a system which is better than free speech or a political system which is better than democracy, then I hope I could change my mind.  However, I am not aware of any serious competitors and I doubt that one exists.

------------

Finally, when it comes to racism and homophobia, you ought to consider this:  Is the reason that you personally are not a racist or homophobe because of laws banning bigoted speech?  I doubt it.  Rather, it's because you find the *rational* arguments against racism to be much more powerful than those in favor.  But those arguments were only made possible precisely because we have a free-speech society.

I really hate the manipualtion of language that has occurred over the last 30 years.

Full Definition of BIGOT

:  a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially.

If you are intolerent of other peoples opinions, you are a bigot. The reality is almost noone examines their own thoughts philosophically and really nail it down. 

There exists no common sense. It is bigoted to rob africans or their coming of age ceremonies that involve slicing up genitals or is it bigoted to allow them?
Everything has to assume a default, but what happens when your default schema is not he same as theirs? 

Will Labour be allowed to ban libertarians from propagating friedmanite theories then to swing back when the tories come in and ban the keynes?

As for the evidence...do you pay much interest to academic papers? Huge swathes are being tested and many are not providing reproducible results. 

Is crime going down? An officer was fired for blowing the whistle on the fiddling, no criming incidents or just not responding. Something like 35%of crimes in London are not investigated, others are disposed of as c'crime related incidents' or rapist are accepting cautions or letters for anti social behaviour.

I remember when snowball earth was proved, then global warming now all of that has been quietly forgotten and a new phrase insidiously assures us of a new truth that may not be questioned, just as the previous dogma could not.

The whole thing was a technical marvel, but they were particularly proud of [Crossness Pumping Station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossness_Pumping_Station), which was designed to be a showcase. It is visitable, although apparently the hours tend to be a bit random. Never seen it myself, but I've wanted to for a long time. I'm not sure if they still steam it, but there are other pumping stations (more commonly for fresh water) that will steam on bank holidays. Everyone should see a [beam engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_engine) in operation one in their lives.

On a similar Victorian theme, have a look at the mainline railway terminals like King's Cross and St Pancras. Usually ignored through familiarity, but they are magnificent.

For something completely different, try the small museum of the Clockmaker's Guild at the Guildhouse. It has things like the first marine chronometers - key to global navigation. You might want to look in to what the Guilds are, and how they relate to the City of London - very odd stuff.

That team was in a downward spiral and the players we brought in were far from being world beaters. There was a lot of bad feeling in general around the club at the time. It couldn't be any different at the moment. Everything is positive. We've got a young side that's only going to get better. Sterling, Coutinho, Sturridge, Allen and Henderson should all improve. Owners that don't fuck about and want to run the club properly. Two of the best strikers in the world. I got really annoyed by what Carragher said because it felt like he was saying it just for the sake of it. This might be our best chance of winning the league, but I think we'll be in the Champions League for a few seasons to come. If we've got Suarez and Sturridge up front, we are always going to score lots of goals. And goals win games. If we bring in some quality players in he summer, sort the defence out, we can only get better. 

What do you think will happen that will cause us to drop down the league so drastically? Chelsea and City will likely definitely finish ahead of us next season, but I still think we'll get top four.

Played really well vs the big teams too, his only problem is that he has to rely on players like Altidore and Cattermole. I am certain of that they will stay up and if the Sunderland management allows him to do some changes in the squad they will again be a solid midtable team at least.

In the US, you don't really get as much controversy outside the pitch (outside of murders, pedophilia, and steroids which are rare but get a lot of exposure in the media). So they are probably not used to harsh banter (which is pretty obvious in r/soccer with some good banter downvoted while the typical circlejerk joke comments always in the top). A good example is in the chants heard in American compared to European games: European chants have more profanity, make fun directly of a team/persons, and don't mind being edgy while American chants are more about supporting the team (""GO TEAM GO"", ""I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL WIN""), and not about attacking the opponents.  

That accounts for American fans, while Europeans hate Mourinho cause either they can't comprehend that Mou is trying to protect his players by taking the spotlight from them and putting it on him...not because of ego. Also, club loyalty has supporters of certain clubs disliking/hating Mou due to his comments, like Barcelona or Arsenal. The last fact that people forget about Mou is that his players are insanely loyal to him (bar Casillas and Ramos), so his ""ego"" is not a problem with his players.

I also really like the character of the team and players that have come through. I feel like the club as whole is really classy. Just a few years ago I discovered that my great grandparents lived in Norwich as well, so that was kinda cool to find out. Overall I really, really love the team and fans. I sincerely hope to visit and get tickets to a home match sometime.

City fans are happy because if they win out their remaining games they'll win the league. 

Meanwhile, Chelsea are top of the table and they've got Mou back. Plus they put the beatdown on Arsenal and United. So, they've got some swagger.

And Liverpool are playing some of their best football in a decade, and have a credible (albeit still small) shot at their first title since it was still the First Division.

I'll pick at that Gylfi question, too.  I think it's fair.  He was good when he came on, and we looked a good deal more threatening.  His goal was definitely deserved, at least in my opinion.  A match winner to cap off a solid 45 minute sub appearance deserves a little rating bump,

I think Naughton is too low.  I personally gave him a give, but I think he deserved at least a four.  He made two mistakes leading directly to goals, but came back from them admirably in the second half.  Should have saved him a bit, in my opinion.

No to Bobby over Ade.  Link up play is there, but I would like to have Ade available.  I think he's the more likely to score, and we wouldn't sacrifice any creativity by playing him first.  Though I think it's at least a discussion, which is more than you could say a month ago.

Townsend over Lennon, no question.  Better in every aspect save defensive workrate, but it's not a huge gap, at least in my opinion.  But Townsend has looked the more likely to make something happen lately, and I don't expect that to change.

And I agree, Sandro needs the start.  No way we can deal with Suarez/Sturridge without the Beast.  He and Bentaleb should be paired in the midfield, with that attacking trio of Townsend/Chadli/Eriksen.  And for the first time, I actually like the idea of Chadli at the 10.  Like /u/Buffaluffasaurus said in another thread, him bullying Stevie G could mean a lot to our defensive efforts.

Maybe try Townsend on his strong side, and Eriksen on the right?  I don't know, at this point I'm willing to see what Timmy decides to do.  He's improved noticeably recently.",0,1395978621,null,0,false,0,cgdw6yr,t3_21kegs,t1_cgdw6yr,t3_21kegs,null,1433102813,12,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,12

The mistakes are what worry me against Liverpool. If you make one wrong move, Sturridge and Suarez can link up in no time. He might be able to get back in time, but not having the physicality of Walker may hurt us.

&gt; Like /u/Buffaluffasaurus said in another thread, him bullying Stevie G could mean a lot to our defensive efforts.

I can see both Gerard and Sandro getting yellow cards tackling each-other. Both players are passionate in their own styles and have been making lots of high risk fouls. Gerard cannot get another yellow or he will be out against Man City. It will be interesting to see how this affects his game.

&gt;Townsend over Lennon, no question.

I agree that Townsend should be starting, but I can't help to think whats going on in Timmy's little head. He seems to be all about leadership and passion which Lennon has the edge on. Who know's what TS is going to do. We never do.

&gt;Maybe try Townsend on his strong side, and Eriksen on the right?

true,KyotoWolf,cnty-wales,Wrexham/Chester,"&gt; Fun fact; until last year when David Cameron was overruled on military action in Syria, that was the last time that the Prime Minister had been ""defeated"" by the commons.

Which is [patently false](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Government_defeats_in_the_House_of_Commons_(1945%E2%80%93present\)). I have no idea where Cowley was coming from with that 'fun fact' and I'd expect better from a man who wrote a book on the defeat of British governments. 

Edit: I can only imagine Cowley was trying to say that Cameron's defeat was the first *foreign policy defeat* since Lord North's no-confidence vote, but that's not really useful - both Asquith and Chamberlain were defeated for the same thing, though they were internal coups rather than parliamentary votes. That's not even mentioning Disraeli losing an election over his foreign policy in Bulgaria. 

Cowley might be right that it's the governments first foreign policy defeat in the Commons, but his statement that you've repeated is hugely misleading and I imagine he was misquoted.",0,1395981720,null,0,1395982612,0,cgdxbtl,t3_21fxkf,t1_cgdxbtl,t1_cgd5roo,null,1433103346,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

F: Doctor... Stop this! 

D: But I thought you liked fear? I thought it tasted good? What's the matter, have you fed on too much honeydew? Is the milk of paradise turning sour? Oh well, if these fears aren't to your liking, let's try some others, shall we? How about... this one? 

F: *SCREAMS,* No, no, no, stop! I'll give you anything you want, Doctor! Anything! Just please, stop!

F: Doctor, please... such pain... oh, such loss... so... many... fears... I've seen enough...

I really hate the crack in the floor exhibit, partly because it's an ugly crack in the floor and partly because a crack in the floor can be interpreted to mean absolutely anything. But on the wikipedia page the artist makes explicit what it's meant to represent:

&gt;It represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred. It is the experience of a Third World person coming into the heart of Europe. For example, the space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space. And so this piece is a negative space.

If that's the best the artist could do to legitimise the crack in the floor then perhaps they should have opted to retain a sense of ambiguity and allow people to draw their own conclusion. But now we know the crack in the floor is just a shoddy metaphor.

So now this beautiful building has a permanent crack in the floor that, according to the artist, has horrible connotations of racial hatred. These issues are important, but is it fair to scar the Tate with a theme that is, by and large, irrelevant to what the building represents? To me, the Tate modern chiefly represents British industry, it's decline and a transformative regeneration into a venue that embodies our societies value for artistic expression. These are things that ought to be celebrated. So why weave in a thread as incongruously negative as the theme of racial hatred? Honestly, I'm no UKIP supporter but this strikes me as an entirely unwelcome finger wagging exercise that is now part of the fabric of the building.

I'm a bit of a modern art apologist and I tend to fly to its defence whenever I see someone making the dismissive argument of it all being a bit daft. I make an exception for this one with extreme prejudice, it's dreadful stupid garbage and represents the worst excesses of contemporary art.

Total bollocks. The Bible is such a huge sprawling patchwork you can find anything you like in it. Let's talk gays and Old Testament.

Galatians 3 KJV
&gt;For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise. Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.

&gt;But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.

Now you could forgive people for being a bit confused by this. You could read it as stating the rules of the Old Testament no longer apply and that the words of Christ supersede them. Then again the trouble with theology is that there is no one interpretation, there are many. They aren't ignoring any more today than they were yesterday. In fact the love of Christ is takes up a lot more room than the gay stuff, I'd say they're doing better.

true,Lit-Up,cnty-uk,Republican,"[It was Dominic Grieve, attorney general.](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/12/attorney-general-unlawful-prince-charles-letters)

&gt; Three senior judges have ruled that Dominic Grieve, the attorney general, acted unlawfully when he blocked the publication of **letters written by Prince Charles to government ministers.**

&gt; The ruling, led by Lord Dyson, the head of the civil judiciary in England and Wales, paves the way for the release of the letters, which reveal how **the prince lobbied government ministers to change official policies.**

&gt; Grieve had refused access to the letters, arguing that they could cause constitutional problems. He had said their contents could seriously damage the prince's ability to perform his duties when he became king because they could **cast doubt on his political neutrality.**

Funny that the Attorney General refused to reveal the content of the letters because they would cast doubt on the Prince's political neutrality. It's a non-defence and underscores the Guardian's entire point - that the content of the letters should be revealed in the public interest due to Charles' lack of political neutrality! Durrrr, Dominic...! Note that this perverse logic could only be uttered in reference to the royal family, where a different set of principles apply. Anybody else whose role requires some kind of perceptible neutrality would be disciplined or otherwise sacked for overstepping the mark or making the wrong noises. But because the throne's sole qualifier is birthright, competence doesn't come into the job, nobody else can apply, so his ""role"" is not under threat. The monarchy therefore retains a virtual immunity from challenge, and regardless of what Charles transgressions are, Grieve is obliged to serve them, including with nonsensical non-defences like the one above. What Grieve says has no material difference - as the monarchy is so entrenched into the fabric of the state, and insulated from the standards expected of most people in public life, Charles can continue to get away with all kinds of things.",0,1395988964,null,0,1395998620,0,cgdzayx,t3_21in0e,t1_cgdzayx,t1_cgdq7xv,null,1433104278,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,scoobersteve91,JE,jersey,"Jose Mourinho has insisted he was only interested in taking charge of Chelsea last summer after being linked with the Manchester United job, and has given his backing to David Moyes to improve next season.

Mourinho was one of the names tipped to replace Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford, but when the legendary Scot decided to retire at the end of last season he quickly announced that Moyes was his choice to fill the hot-seat.

Moyes has come under pressure in his first year at the helm after a miserable defence of their Premier League crown, and United's final chance of silverware this term lies in the Champions League after making it through to a quarter-final against Bayern Munich.

Mourinho believes Moyes needs to be given time to adjust to a new club, and has dismissed suggestions that he ever had an interest in the United role.

""I don't know if Sir Alex thought of me for United or not,"" Mourinho said in The Sun.

""The point is he clearly knew I wanted to go to Chelsea. I spoke with him after we (Real Madrid) knocked United out of the Champions League last season and I told him what I wanted to do - that Chelsea is what I wanted, that was the direction I wanted to go.""

""As for David, he went to a new club - a club with a new reality for him - and he is adapting.

""Next season will be better and attention, attention! He can still win the Champions League this season.""

Asked if Moyes would have been sacked by now if he had been at Chelsea, Mourinho added: ""Maybe not. Maybe Chelsea now has a different vision, working to a different profile with a different strategy.""

Mourinho is fighting for the title with Chelsea and determined to become champions, although he is already proud of what has been achieved at Stamford Bridge this season.

He said: ""We know every match is vital until the end of the season. We don't give up, we don't give in - we go to win every game.

""This is a special season for me and my Chelsea even if we don't win anything. To push to win the Premier League and to go from the Europa League to the last eight of the Champions League is an important step.""

Liverpool are among Chelsea's main rivals for the title and Mourinho is happy that Brendan Rodgers, a former coach at Stamford Bridge, is enjoying success.

He said: ""We are friends. If I made any contribution for him to become a manager at a big team then I'm happy with that.""",0,1395995826,null,0,false,0,cge0jco,t3_21kvbt,t1_cge0jco,t3_21kvbt,null,1433104860,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

true,Blaidd_Dwrg,eng-lancashire,Preston,"There's a process for disputing ATM transactions. I don't know the exact details of how Lloyds handle it, but at the bank I work for it's as follows:

* Report the problem either in branch or via telephone.

* If the problem occurred today the advisor will tell you to give it 24 hours as in most cases the machine will detect the fault and automatically credit the money back to your account.

* If it's been more than 24 hours the advisor will take the details of the dispute (amount, time, location etc) and forward them to the ATM dispute team. No additional evidence is requested from the customer.

* This team then liaises with the machine's operator to determine if there has been an error. If they get a positive response back they can then credit the money back to your account. This process is somewhat lengthy and can take up to 15 working days.

I don't know why it takes so long; with any other type of disputed transaction we will credit the money back immediately, then do the investigation and if we find that you were lying about it we'll simply take the money back. ATM disputes are the exception to this rule.

Again that's just my bank's process, Lloyds may handle it differently although I suspect there will be some amount of standardisation as the banks will have an agreement between themselves on how to resolve disputes.

Given that you were promised a refund and have not got one, you have grounds for a complaint and I'd definitely suggest making one. It may or may not speed along the resolution to your dispute but at the very least you'd likely get a goodwill payment of ~£25 as an apology for being given the wrong advice. I suspect the advisor you spoke to initially followed the wrong process and did something silly like submit a direct debit indemnity claim.

If you are not happy with the outcome you can refer the case to the Financial Ombudsman Service. If you are thinking of going down this route make sure you let the complaints handler know. FOS charges the bank a fee every time they have to step in regardless of whether they rule in favour of the customer or not. It's often cheaper for the bank to just give you what you want.

If you have any questions I'll try to answer them, but if it's something specific to Lloyds I'll likely only be able to offer an educated guess.",0,1395998053,null,0,false,0,cge0v4v,t3_21jeqv,t1_cge0v4v,t3_21jeqv,null,1433105079,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Have a national wide program of training up unemployed people who have an IT interest. Run a one or two day course in how to configure a parental control / web filtering  in the main ISP's routers (sky,talk talk, o2, bt etc) and pay them a basic wage with a certification at the end. 

They then offer this as a free service to empower parents to protect their kids online themselves, instead of these ridiculous forced measures. 

There should also be more outreach programs and educational presence of the effects that internet porn can have on someone.

My belief is we might need to do something as there may be health issues we need to factor. I am far from religious and I don't look at this from a moral angle, but I am very concerned about the effects that on-demand, instant HD porn of any wanted taste might have on the young developing brains. Studies are starting to show that internet porn addiction has the same brain changing impact as [drug and alcohol addiction](http://www.socioaffectiveneuroscipsychol.net/index.php/snp/article/view/20767/29179) and is leading to [erectile dysfunction](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marnia-robinson/erectile-dysfunction-_b_3849582.html) mainly in young men - all of this can also manifest as depression and low self esteem, feeling tired all the time (from all the dopamine spikes going on) and in turn effecting relationships with others, work, study and leading a happy outgoing life (which we all deserve and should have).

Here is a good no nonsense, fact based video series if anyone is interested [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS9vumF6JMU)

&gt;__Software as a service__ (__SaaS__; pronounced /sæs/ or /sɑːs/ ) is a [software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software) delivery model  in which software and associated [data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing\)) are centrally [hosted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_hosting_service) on the [cloud](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) by [independent software vendors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_software_vendor) (ISVs) or [application service providers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_service_provider) (ASPs). It is sometimes referred to as ""service(s) as a software substitute"" (SaaSS) or ""on-demand software"".  SaaS is typically accessed by [users](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_(computing\)) using a [thin client](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_client) via a [web browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser). SaaS has become a common delivery model for many business applications, including office &amp; messaging software, DBMS software, management software, CAD software, dDevelopment software, [gamification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification), [virtualization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization_software_licensing),  [accounting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_software), [collaboration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_software), [customer relationship management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) (CRM), [management information systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_information_systems) (MIS), [enterprise resource planning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) (ERP), invoicing, [human resource management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resource_management) (HRM), [content management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management) (CM) and service desk management.  SaaS has been incorporated into the strategy of all leading [enterprise software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_software) companies.  One of the biggest selling points for these companies is the potential to reduce IT support costs by outsourcing hardware and software maintenance and support to the SaaS provider.

Wow, great effort to win hearts and minds there.  Seriously, if you disagree, tell me why.  I am a reasonable human being and I assume you are too.  Going personal makes us both look silly.

Obviously it doesn't seem impossible for 26% of 500,000 households to make other arrangements TO ME.  That's only 125,000 households (out of about 30,000,000 in the UK I think).  And they have plenty of other options.  They could pay the extra money and do nothing.  They could get someone else in to cover the extra cost.  They could apply to be exempted.  They could agree to take in someone who would increase their allotment of rooms as well.  Or they could find a family that needs to move up and swap.  Last I heard, social housing lists were pretty long and there were plenty of families in pokey 2 bed flats.

I am sure that for some of them, none of these brilliant ideas it took me almost 7 seconds to think of are appropriate.  But for 26% of them?  No.

I am responsible for my rent.  If it goes up and I don't pay it, the council won't re-house me for the exact reasons you list.  I am responsible for planning and budgeting and saving and going to work and buying food and washing my own clothes.

Is it really too much to ask social tenants to take some responsibility for themselves?  Some of them, sure but 26%?  I doubt it (edit:  And if there are then why are they in social housing when they really need to be in sheltered accommodation with an on site career?).  Why should they be allowed to simply ignore their solvable problems and expect the government to look after their every whim when the rest of us are expected to go it alone?

I am more than happy to exempt some people where there is a clear need.  I am more than happy for people not to have to pay until something smaller becomes available (though I doubt it is impossible for such a small number of households to either downsize or take in a lodger).

I am not willing to let 26% of people off simply because they refuse to take any action.

Let's take the case of children then, which is actually a better example than my women's group illustration.

If an adult wants to verbally abuse her/his child, would you defend the right to do so? Does a father have a right to call his infant daughter - I don't know ""a filthy whore"" constantly from the moment she wakes until the moment she goes to sleep. Or can we agree that, in principle, there is a limit to his freedom of speech, even if it takes an extreme example to demonstrate that principle?

Not to want to make this about me, but for the record I too am an outspoken atheist with strong views about my right to criticise religion. I am not apologising for those that would censor me in the name of protecting from offence. What I am trying to establish is that a limit to free speech exists in principle, in order to understand (if not necessarily agree with) the fact that different people draw the line in different places.

You can put children into sets based on their capabilities, but this has two problems: 

- 1) You need a teacher for each set. This is not a problem in large comprehensives that would need many classes for the same subject anyway. But primary schools do not have the space or resources.
- 2) upward mobility between the sets, for kids that do badly at exams, but shine during the course, is near non-existent.

So test the 4 years olds, by all means, but what are they going to do with the results? If the answer is ""very little/nothing"", or worse ""see how schools are performing"", then perhaps we leave testing until later?

&gt;The __Britons__ (sometimes __Brythons__ or __British people__) were the people who spoke the [Insular Celtic language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_Celtic_languages) known as [Common Brittonic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Brittonic). They lived in [Great Britain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain) during the [Iron Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Iron_Age), the [Roman era](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain) and the [post-Roman era](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Roman_Britain). After the arrival of the [Anglo-Saxons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxons) the population was either subsumed into Anglo-Saxon culture, becoming ""English""; retreated; or persisted in the [Celtic fringe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_fringe) areas of [Wales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales), [Cornwall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwall) and southern [Scotland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland), with some emigrating to [Brittany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany). The relationship of the Britons to the [Picts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts) north of the Forth has been the subject of much discussion, though most scholars accept that the [Pictish language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictish_language) during this time was a branch of Common Brittonic.

Put it this way, lets say you need to invest £20billion to build a new power station, it will take 4 years to build (more to plan) and you won't see a penny of profit from it for over 20 years. So you do a big market analysis to decide if its profitable to build and decide that yes, you are likely under the current regulations to see a return on your investment. 

Then lets say the government changes the rules about building power stations and about what price you can charge for electricity every few years. That really fucks up your analysis and now you have basically no idea what's going to happen. 

So do you invest your £20b in a super risky 20 year project or something less risky which you will see a return on in 4-5 years time even though ultimately it will make you less money?

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"In principle it applies to every big-money sport in the world, the question is always how you actually generate the metrics in a way that gives you useful information.

In a lot of ways it's easier for baseball - although it's a team sport, for batting in particular it's very individual and there are a lot of statistics that can be put together to give an objective figure for how good someone is. In football because of the nature of a team game, things can be a lot more complicated.

Maybe a striker scores a lot of goals because he's a great striker, or maybe it's because he has a team around him that plays to his strengths and provides him with those opportunities. A midfielder with a great pass completion rate might only have that because they never go for the kind of ambitious balls you actually need to split a defence open. A player with great stats in La Liga might not adopt so well to the different styles of play in the Bundesliga or Premier League. It can be incredibly complicated to do it well. 

That said, I have a close friend who works as a mathematical analyst in a sports statistical consultancy  and every time I discuss this kind of stuff with him I'm amazed how simple some of the models actually are and how much can strip out that intuitively you'd expect would matter (the concept of ""form"" or ""morale"" for example, is completely irrelevant in a lot of sports when you actually crunch the numbers on it). 

I'd be amazed if FSG weren't applying a similar method - it's what they credit their success to with the Red Sox, and it would seem ridiculous for them to have a successful approach for managing a sports team and just throw it out the window for us. I think for the most part recently we've been pretty steady for refusing to pay above what we think a player might actually be worth (Carroll and probably Downing aside).

-------------------------------

Raheem Sterling is early - 45 minutes early. In my 14 years in sports journalism, this is unprecedented for a Premier League footballer.

It's the first sign, of many, that the team around one of England's most exciting young talents is working hard to make sure he keeps his feet on the ground.

He arrives at his favourite Italian restaurant in Liverpool accompanied by his agent and a small team filming him as part of a documentary.

He's affable but shy and in many ways a typical teenager - sipping on a cola, constantly texting.

It's only when the 19-year-old takes off his jacket for lunch that I notice his entire left arm is covered, from shoulder to wrist, in tattoos.

At the top is the face and name of his daughter, Melody Rose - ""the best thing that's ever happened"" to him. She was born in 2012 after a brief relationship and is his only child, despite ""silly online rumours"" to the contrary.

If you search his name on the internet, one of the first suggestions is 'Raheem Sterling four kids'. This, he says, is the public's biggest misconception of him.
He quips that he actually ""has eight"", but then adds: ""It made people think badly of me, that I'm not really grounded, that I'm out and about doing loads of madness.""
It's not the only thing contributing to a bad boy reputation. In May 2013, he had a [common assault charge against him dropped](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-22596223) after a witness failed to turn up to court.

And in September last year, he was [found not guilty of assault against a former girlfriend](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-24178588). He knows he's ""made mistakes"" in the past but says he's young and is using those experiences to help him grow up and move on.
Back to those tattoos. On the inside of his biceps are the words 'Thank you mama for the nine months you carried me, through all the pain and suffering'.

It's clear his mother, Nadine - who he jokes ""thinks she's Jose Mourinho"" - is a constant presence and strength in his life.

Sterling says: ""She's a big part of my life - she tries to have too much of a say sometimes! I try to listen to her, because most of what she says is right.
""My mum thinks she knows her football! She'll certainly tell me when I'm not doing something right. At other times she'll say I'm not listening to her. There's been a few clashes with her.""

She left Maverley, Jamaica, for England when he was aged five and once she had found work, moved Raheem and his three siblings to the tough St Raphael's estate in the shadow of Wembley.
Sterling was removed from mainstream primary school because of behavioural problems and [spent three years at Vernon House special school](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20323590), where the youngster was told by a teacher: ""If you carry on the way you're going, by the time you're 17 you'll either be in prison or playing for England.""

A prophetic statement, made because it was clear that although he could be disruptive, he was a talented footballer.

Sterling joined QPR at the age of 11, where he was quickly nicknamed 'Raheem Park Rangers' by his peers. With several big teams interested in him, [he chose Liverpool when he was 15](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8541174.stm).
England manager Roy Hodgson, then in charge of Liverpool, handed Sterling his senior debut for the Reds in a pre-season friendly against Borussia Monchengladbach.

The slight, diminutive boy who was repeatedly knocked off the ball by older players is still the same height - just 5ft 7in - but has ""bulked up a bit"" and Hodgson has made it clear that [Sterling is in his World Cup thoughts](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26215060).

""He has seen me play and I think he likes the way I play. I'm grateful he's the manager of England,"" Sterling says.
""He gives me good motivation to do well. He puts his arm around me and gives me little things I can do better at.""

Sterling's form for Liverpool since Christmas has been electrifying. He has scored seven goals this season and set up many more. He cites Brendan Rodgers as a huge influence.

""He's helped me massively,"" Sterling explains. ""Not only with my footballing game but if I need someone to talk to off the field he's there for me. I've got to really give credit to him and thank him a lot.""

But while Liverpool's resurgence is a source of pride and excitement in the red half of the city, the players have clearly been briefed not to get carried away. [Manager Rodgers has played down his side's title chances](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26761595) and his charges have followed suit.

""I don't want to be the one that says Liverpool can go on and win the league,"" Sterling says. ""But there's a real belief and togetherness in the squad, we're all working for each other. We all know what the dream is at the end of it.""
And the other dream lies in Brazil. He has Wembley tube station and the stadium tattooed on his crowded arm. They are a reminder of his past and what he describes now as ""the dream that's becoming a reality"", following [a man-of-the-match display in the friendly win over Denmark on 5 March](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26349068).

Passing his old haunts on the team coach to that game, he says had to pinch himself: ""I was looking at the sights thinking: 'I used to play there a couple of years back and now I'm on the coach with the England team.'""
Nicknamed 'Heemio' by his mates for his Brazilian-style flicks and tricks, going to Rio would mean everything.
""Growing up you watch players like Ronaldinho playing in World Cups, doing the business and you idolise these people,"" he says.
""To then get called up by England for a World Cup? I don't think there'd be a greater feeling, knowing you could help make the nation proud.""

With a future this bright, it's handy he has got room on his other arm for all the tattoos that will surely follow.
The full interview with Raheem Sterling will appear on BBC One's Football Focus this Saturday, 29 March, at 12:00 GMT.

The scheme is set so that the contributions phase up to the 3% employer minimum, total 8% minimum, over the next 4 years, and all the staff responded positively to the plans.  The other one was very similar numbers.

As for AE being a scam, it's actually a rather clever move from the government, as they're trying to eliminate a lot of future reliance on the state from state pensions - their thinking is that people won't need as much from the government as they'll have these small pension pots from their working life and that it's miles easier to get at them now. What's really funny is that because NEST has no option of transferring out yet, there's very little incentive to use them now.

When people have to pay more rent only several things can happen to them:

They pay the shortfall

They move

They get thrown out and become homeless.

They get thrown out and rehoused.

If all 4 of these end-results are a success, then what is a failure? The government can't lose with people like you, because you'll call it a success whatever happens... Would you call it a failure if say 5% of those affected became long-term homeless from it? Or would it still be a success because 6% of those affected moved to a smaller property? 

Noone denies that the ""bedroom tax"" lowers the amount of HB that is paid out, but that's not really the whole of the story is it? 

The issue is the immense amount of hardship it's caused to the worst off in society, and the huge amount of anger and bad will it's caused. Contrary to popular belief, pissing off thousands of people that have little to lose for the sake of a few pounds is not clever or big. 

If they had made the ""bedroom tax"" apply to new claims only, none of these problems would have happened. Labour did this with LHA a few years ago, which is why you never heard much about it in the press. There's a difference between telling people ""oh this house you've lived in for decades, you now owe £20 more per week"" and telling people ""if you move into this house it will be underoccupied and you will have to pay at least £20 per week even if on full benefit"".

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Personally, I think we should distinguish between offensive speech and harassment

I agree, emphatically. I believe that people should be free to use speech to offend people, not free to use speech to harass people. This is where I draw the line on the limit of free speech.

&gt;I started off defending the idea that adults don't get PTSD because of hurtful speech and now you're asking me to defend the idea that children can't be bullied by adults.

No I'm not asking that in the slightest. I'm inviting you to acknowledge that using speech to abuse children is an example of where freedom of speech ends. This is the principle *I* started off with, which you and others replied to before going on to talk about PTSD, children etc. If anything, I am getting the argument back on track.

I suggest that we put aside discussion about structure of the argument, which is a creeping distraction in itself.

Two straightforward questions:

1. Can we agree that using speech to abuse children is an example of where freedom of speech ends?

2. If so, can we agree, logically, that freedom of speech has a limit?

I would ask anybody who disagrees to convince me that the example scenario is incompatible with the concept of free speech or to confirm their view that people have the freedom to use abusive speech towards children.

Again, all I am trying to do is establish the principle that freedom of speech is limited, in answer to the title of the thread. The perception that somebody is failling to defend free speech would be better percieved as somebody who draws the limit at a different point.",0,1396011451,null,0,false,0,cge3adv,t3_21hydj,t1_cge3adv,t1_cge2de7,null,1433106222,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

In my early days on /r/soccer I was more liberal with my personal information.  Right around the time I started to get threatening PMs I thought it probably better to delete those and start again.  Unfortunately it was easier to delete all posts than soft through every one of them individually to check.

Shame as well, you can see from the replies the exact shit I was putting up with.  His entire post was a dig at me.  I'll clear some things up:

&gt;Buying a player for 25m and selling him for 18m is actually a profitable move.

When I came here absolutely nobody understood what amortisation was and they could not understand how you could make a profit on the books whilst selling for less than purchase price.  This is the ""mental gymnastics"" that he's referring to.

&gt;Carrying a player wage bill that is 110 percent of club revenues is a sound strategy for financial sustainability.

They didn't understand the plan all along was to bring in a team capable of getting into the CL and building the Club's financial base from there.  Khaldoon literally states this in our 08-09 accounts but they didn't get it.

&gt;It makes more sense to pay a player six figures a week and leave him on the reserves than to sell him at a loss (though that loss would still somehow be profitable -- see point one).

Seem to think this was about an Adebayor to Spurs rumour.  At that point in time I said that it would make better financial sense to keep Ade in the reserves on £5m whilst we were in direct competition with Spurs for the last CL spot.  I still think that's true.  We only sold him once we'd surpassed Spurs.

&gt;The fact that Man City has by far the greatest negative operating margin in the EPL proves that it is on the most sound financial footing and is in the strongest position to operate profitably.

This is just him being a twat.

&gt;Even though very few professional sports teams anywhere are very profitable (and even the ones that are profitable are only marginally so), Sheikh Mansour's investment shows his undisputable business acumen.

/r/soccer could not fathom how Sheikh Mansour could profit from City.  I tried to point to edge businesses that see a major growth in revenue due to City and their promotion of Abu Dhabi as a tourist destination.  Apparently this was too complicated an issue for the userbase to understand.

&gt;Emirati oil princes are well known for their shrewdness at business, at not at all known for their habits of buying expensive toys or for spending obscene amounts of money on follies.

This was my reply to the ""they'll get bored"" argument.  I said that Sheikh Mansour, unlike the stereotype in the US media, isn't some random guy throwing money around but instead he's a serious businessman who is attempting to invest in a commodity that will bring in revenues for decades to come.  In particularly I point at him making several billion pounds by buying and selling something within about 6 months.

&gt;Overpaying on transfer fees does not distort the player market in any way whatsoever. Neither does paying absurdly high wages.

He was saying that paying Toure, Adebayor, Tevez over £100k a week distorted the market.  This is not at all how the football economy works; it is always based on rising revenues.  There's books written on this but it shows you the incredibly simplistic mindset of some users.

&gt;Getting bounced from the group stage of the Champions League would be just fine, since the team doesn't have much depth and would be better focused on other competitions.

As people would agree now but vehemently disagreed then, City's squad at the end of the 2010-2011 season when this was posted was nowhere near deep enough to compete on all levels.  People said we had the best squad in the world.  I said people were on smack or something.

I believe the turbine hall was meant to remain intact and viewable whilst being below the largest stand. You're right that there was a lot more demolition involved in the Chelsea plan but I think that's a rather strange way to assess it. By all means it makes sense when preserving a building. But an icon isn't just a building but about the sort of thing it represents in London's history. I also wonder what impact it will have on the British Film Council or anyone really involved in the media. It's a go to spot for contexting London or a bleak moment of reflection to look at the power station. I'm not really sure where the next such icon will come from but similar to the protest at changing street light colours in California I imagine an argument can be made.

In the end, if it's all about the money I still don't understand why they wouldn't negotiate it with Chelsea. Whilst I realise it removes most of what presumably makes up B station I can't understand that being the main conflict. I think Politically if Boris had a final say then he'd rather it was taken over by people who will start work immediately while Chelsea would still have to battle the internal politics and Pitch Owners association before actually moving. Although I suppose FFP has kind of made that decision for us. Unless we had some sort of chance of burying the fulham broadway tracks and moving the oratory school. Or somehow making the Cemetery move then we're pretty much buggered for stadium moves.

The government raised VAT and people had 2 options:  pay it or don't by that item, either way the government wins.  Giving people a list of acceptable choices is an acceptable approach to any change right?  The only disagreement here is when and for who the bedroom tax is an acceptable choice.

I consider it a failure when someone (even 1 person, let alone 1%) becomes homeless through *no fault of their own*.  Anything else is a success, since anything else cuts the social housing bill without making people homeless.

I don't accept that 26% of people in arrears have all made every possible effort not to be in arrears.

I don't accept that having to move house is an immense amount of hardship.  I don't think there is a difference between telling people they have to pay more or move whether they have been there decades or not.  In fact, I think people who have been renting in the same place for decades should sort of expect to move:  Their circumstances have probably changed and any other landlord would likely have moved them on sooner anyway.  Personally, I think there are far too many people sitting alone in houses bigger than they need because their kids grew up and moved out.  That is in the private and the public housing sectors but in the private sector, it's less my business.

Sadly I agree that expecting common sense always seems to be too much for governments.  Labour were happy to house people an just pay the every bigger bills.  The Tories will dump them all on the street without a second thought.

Yet, you would seem to be quite happy if I referenced the multiple personal anecdotes on the subject that I’ve obtained in my fifteen years of working in media? (Or would you just dismiss that too, I wonder.)

## Before we start, let me summarise my posts:

1. ""I wouldn't worry, non-compete clauses are difficult to enforce even if you were staying in the UK.""
1. ""It definitely won't apply if you're moving abroad, employers can't stop you working outside of a reasonable geographical area."" ... ""Non-competes are only subject to reasonable geographical regions."" ... ""if the rest of the clause was iron-tight the fact that he's moving to a different country entirely negates everything.""
1. ""Your employer would have to prove that they've made actual losses due to you supposedly breaking the clause."" ... ""The 'money owed' would have to be proven to a court,"" 
1. ""First up, not everything in a contract is legally binding just by being in a contract"" ... ""if it goes against the laws of the land then it's null and void.""
1. ""It's very difficult to prove and in most instances isn't worth pursuing.""
1. ""You send a lawyer. The lawyer takes them to court and the court decides how much, if anything is owed.""



## So, bearing all that in mind, after spending four minutes on google, let's begin…

[From Wikipedia “Non-Compete-Clause”:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause)

&gt;In the United Kingdom, CNCs are called Restraint of Trade clauses and may be used **only if the employer can prove a legitimate business interest** to protect in entering the clause into the contract. Mere competition will not amount to a legitimate business interest.

# Please refer to point 5.


&gt;Most jurisdictions in which such contracts have been examined by the courts have deemed CNCs to be legally binding so long as the clause contains **reasonable limitations as to the geographical area** and time period in which an employee of a company may not compete.

# Please refer to point 2.

[From Wikipedia “Restraint of Trade”:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restraint_of_trade)

&gt; if a restraining clause is found to be unreasonable, then it will be void.

# Please refer to point 4.

Now, considering you don’t seem to think that Wikipedia is a valid source of information, and that it might be made up, let’s look elsewhere:

[From Lawdit.co.uk:](http://www.lawdit.co.uk/reading-room/restraint-of-trade-clauses)

&gt;The general rule is that all restraint of trade clauses are unenforceable at common law.

# Please refer to point 1.

But wait, there’s more:

&gt;However, the Court will enforce such clauses if they are considered reasonable with reference to the interests of the parties and do not breach the public interest in free trade. **So if this does go to court then it will be messy.** 

# Please refer to point 5.

&gt;The clauses in the contract must be no more than is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the party relying upon it. No one is allowed to restrict competition just for the sake of it. However, the Court will not look into the adequacy of consideration, i.e. the court will not consider whether the party that has been restrained has been paid enough for that restraint. **It will be for the Claimant to prove on a balance of probabilities that the clause is protecting their legitimate interests.**

# Please refer to point 5.

&gt;**Much of this will depend on who is prepared to ' go all the way' because most of it will be based on court law.**

# Please refer to points 4, 5, and 6.

From another page on Lawdit:

&gt;Restraint of trade clauses are void unless the employer has a legitimate business interest to protect and the clauses are reasonable in terms of activity prohibited, time limit and **geographical extent**. Clauses may be deemed enforceable if they lack uncertainty, or if they are too wide.

# Please refer to point 2.

[From Insite Law:](http://www.insitelawmagazine.com/ch13illegaility.htm)

&gt;As a general proposition, the courts will not enforce contracts whose purpose is illegal and this includes not only agreements that are criminal in intent but also injurious to society in the wider sense.

# Please refer to point 4.


&gt;Where a contract is illegal, the consequences are in general as follows:

&gt;(i) **The contract is void** and therefore neither party can sue upon it – ex turpi causa non oritur actio (no right of action arises from a base case);

# Please refer to point 4.

&gt;“Every member of the community is entitled to carry on any trade or business he chooses and in such manner as he thinks the most desirable in his own interests, so long as he does nothing unlawful; with the consequence that **any contract which interferes with the free exercise of his trade or business, by restricting him in the work he may do for others, is a contract in restraint of trade. It is invalid unless it is reasonable as between the parties.**”

&gt;*Lord Morris, (ibid) referring to Lord Denning MR in Petrofina*

# Please refer to point 4.

&gt;Employer/Employee covenants

&gt;An employee, on terminating his employment with a particular employer, will agree not to work for a competing employer nor set up a competing business.

&gt;**Both types of agreement usually have some limits of area and duration.**

# Please refer to point 2.

&gt;**Three conditions must be satisfied**

&gt;In employer/employee and vendor/purchaser covenants three conditions must be satisfied:

&gt;(a) there must be an interest to protect

&gt;(b) **the restraint must be reasonable**, and

&gt;(c) it must not be contrary to the public interest.

# Please refer to point 2.

&gt;While the principles will apply both to employer/employee and vendor/purchaser covenants **the law is very much stricter in relation to the former** and the latter will be considered later in so far as the criteria differ.

# Please refer to point 5.

## To summarise my findings:

* NCCs are null and void if they're not reasonable. 
* There can only be reasonable limitations of a NCC, including geographical. 
* Validity of an NCC is decided by a court.
* NCCs are difficult to prove, and therefore most don't try.

## In conclusion, my message to OP is:

&gt;I wouldn't worry, non-compete clauses are difficult to enforce even if you were staying in the UK.

&gt;Your employer would have to prove that they've made actual losses due to you supposedly breaking the clause.

&gt;It definitely won't apply if you're moving abroad, employers can't stop you working outside of a reasonable geographical area.

&gt;Unless you were really high up and taking incredibly commercial or technical information with you they won't even begin to think about taking you to court.

# Wait, isn't that what I said in my very first post?

My final quote will be from one of your posts: ""Sorry, but you're wrong. I'd invite you to go and do some reading on this and educate yourself.""

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"The Lib Dems actually *gained* votes in the last election, and this was partly down to Clegg and partly down to popular policies and Labour voters jumping ship. They lost seats because of a history of Gerrymandering by the two dominant parties which meant they were pretty much always the runners up behind a dominant Labour or Conservative candidate. This is why we need to change the election system from first past the post, and shake up the constituencies a bit, a large proportion of people are not represented by either the party or candidate they voted for.

Now for European elections, we have a proportional representation system. This is how Farage himself is an MEP, along with 8 other UKIP MEPs, meaning they actually get a say on EU policy matters. I doubt UKIP will get more than a single seat in the next UK general election for the same reasons mentioned above, UKIP votes will be spread across the country, across many constituencies. Farage might get a seat because he's well known, but as for the other UKIP candidates? I seriously doubt it.

Also, to add to your point about UKIP forming a coalition with a hated party, I don't think it needs to be like that. What we have is a situation where any party that UKIP may join in a coalition doesn't share the same view on their most important policy; EU membership. The best he's ever going to get is a referendum, and like the electoral reform referendum pushed by the Lib Dems in this coalition government, it is not going to turn out like they or their supporters hoped. UKIP will not be able to make a difference unless they somehow become the third or even second largest party by number of seats.

TL;DR UKIP will get a lot of votes but won't get enough seats to make a difference because of the current electoral system, which makes UKIP very similar to the Lib Dems in this regard.

Hope this helps.

Here is a list of camping supply shops in edinburgh:

[Tiso's](http://www.tiso.com/uk_shops/edinburgh/): All outdoors gear. 1 shop in the city centre and 1 to the North. Very well stocked, quite expensive but quality gear.

[Leith army store](http://www.lasoutdoors.com/): Fairly central, lots of ex-army kit as well as full supply of clothing and some very cheap tents.

[GoOutdoors](http://www.gooutdoors.co.uk/edinburgh): Massive warehouse store in the North of the city,sells everything, some stuff very cheap, some not (esp. clothing). Also climbing, bike, and Fishing gear. Will beat any internet prices by 10% so take your smartphone.

[Blacks](http://www.blacks.co.uk/): Fairly cheap high street gear, some low quality with poor service!

[Nordic Outdoors](https://www.nordicoutdoor.co.uk): Top quality Scandi gear, very nice, not cheap. Two shops, one in the South and one in the North.

You mean like the one reporter from Russia who was in Crimea for short period and even though was allowed to vote? Or the ones in Russia when somehow Putin is chosen at every election (beside the third one, when he has put his puppet and became prime minister instead, not to violate their law or whatever). Find me one politician in Europe, who has stayed such long in politics on that high level.

&gt;We've got a mostly corrupt press,

Corrupt press? Yes, some of them. But you know why? Not because Putin (read: government) tells them what to print and what not (not saying about locking people in jail for anti-Putin articles or similar). For example some press in UK is controlled by rich oligarchs and their personal views are seen in papers. However, how can you compare EU's press with Russian? Are you a supporter of that NWO crap? Just look at British press. You have Guardian on one side, the Daily Mail on the other and all the politician's secrets are published (frankly the more the better for the paper - look Leveson inquiry).

&gt;we have no say in our democracy apart from a circus election every 5 years.

As a lifelong Evertonian and a season ticket holder at Goodison for the entire of Moyes' time at our club I probably know more about Moyes as a manager than most. I was extremely surprised he was given the United job. I think he is a decent manager but nothing more than that. Yes he did well at Everton (particularly for the first 6-8 years), but the narrative that David Moyes was the only thing keeping us away from the bottom half of the league lost any substance whatsoever after this initial period of stability in Moyes' first 2/3 or 3/4 of his time with us. After that point, the idea of ""plucky little Everton who should be thankful for finishing 7th"" was simply used as a tool to lower expectations and thus essentially make Moyes immune from any criticism. Some Everton fans were blinded by this, others felt that Moyes had overstayed his welcome and were not too unhappy to see him leave when he did.
The fact is, in the biggest games he constantly got his tactics completely and utterly wrong and from what I've seen of United this season he doesn't seem to have learned his lesson and Im not sure he ever will (Semi-final against Sunderland is mainly what Im referring to here, literally predicted exactly how that game would play out as well as the game against Olympiacos). At the end of the day, that is just indicative of a wider, more deep-rooted issue in Moyes' ideological view of football as a whole. He is a negative manager, simple as that. His ideological core is one of risk aversion, negativity, reactiveness, whatever words you want to use it all points in the same direction. You can see it in every facet of his mannerisms. Watch his press conferences and other media interviews and you can just see how ultimately negative the dude is. He would always focus on negatives and rarely praise players. (just ask Ross Barkley). And this fits into why we always struggled when it really mattered the most. His tactics in the big games were ""try and keep it tight and see if we can nick a goal"". That may work in certain games but in the long-run it won't bring real success.
To an outsider (and to the media in particular) this might seem unfair. What about all the great wins at Goodison against the big teams? Yes they were great but ultimately he got it wrong when it REALLY mattered. There are 3 specific games I will never forget and I will never, ever, ever forgive David Moyes for - Away for Fiorentina in the Europa League (08 I think) when we lost 2-0 (Almost a carbon copy of Uniteds 2-0 loss to Olympiacos the other week, that was classic Moyes tactics). Away at Sporting Lisbon (2010) when we were 2-1 up from the first leg and just sat back for the entire game and comfortably lost 2-0. And finally the worst one of all - Vs Liverpool FA Cup Semi-final 2012. That was the day I wanted him out of my club. That was the day I KNEW WITHOUT ANY SHADOW of a doubt that David Moyes is not and never will be a great manager.
I have seen nothing whatsoever that makes me believe otherwise. In fact, I am almost surprised by how bad tactically Moyes has been at United. The poorness of United's squad is one of the biggest myths propagated by the current media. It is lazy and incorrect. Of course, United's squad is not as strong as it may have been in the past in relative terms but I believe it is still very, very strong. Particularly with the signing of Mata and the breakthrough of Januzaj who is like a new signing. United won the league by a silly margin last season and not all that much has changed since then squad-wise (I know others have strengthened though). World-class players dont just become bad, the buck stops with the manager. He is who motivates them, who trains with them and who instructs them; Uniteds shocking results this season have been down to the tactics of the manager, that Im quite certain of.",0,1396018819,null,0,false,0,cge5zb9,t3_21g0xp,t1_cge5zb9,t3_21g0xp,null,1433107490,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1

No it isn't. It is about me illustrating a direct answer to the headline's direct question:

Q: Why do so many so-called liberals fail to defend free speech? 

A: There are varying definitions on the extent of free speech. People vary at where they draw the line, some at the point of blasphemy, others at the point of abuse. This is not the same as failing to defend free speech fundamentally, a paradox suggested by the headline.

Depicting scenarios to illustrate an abstract point is not argument creep.

&gt;which is why most people understand that you don't have the right to 'shout fire in a crowded theater'

*Hey - but what if there was a real fire? And anyway, I never mentioned theatres or fires before. Why are you asking me to defend setting theatres on fire?*
^ That would be argument creep.

&gt;I don't think free-speech rights are infinite 

That's exactly my point. I'm glad we agree on that. All I am trying to get across is that the limit of free speech is not universally agreed. 

And you're correct, *most* people understand that you can't shout in a theatre, but others would argue that this is their right.

Similarly I would argue that I have the right to criticise religion. A hell of a lot of people disagree.

Compare with the cost of interest on a mortgage for a machine that costs say £200k.
