true,cyphered,uk,Kent,"I absolutely don't blame the advisors. I've worked in customer service long enough to know that the majority of the time it is really hard to sort out someone's problem due to a whole bunch of factors that the customer may not always realise and I desperately try to be understanding, and I'm definitely never rude to them and take care not to blame them in any way. I know it must be ridiculously hard trying to work out from different people's notes what has been going on, and obviously I don't understand the full ins and outs of it so my explanation of it isn't going to be perfect either.

It's frustrating because at first I didn't think about the number being charged - I only have a mobile so of course it is expensive to call 0845 numbers, and that was the number provided to me. Dialled it without thinking and got a pretty high phone bill. Now that the poster above has told me about the international number that should help. But no matter how frustrated I was yesterday (as each person I called kept basically telling me it was someone else's fault) I did not even raise my voice - I am always careful not to and to stress the fact that I appreciate their help. When one of them was able to offer a solution I think I must have sounded mad how much I thanked her - I was nearly in tears because of how grateful I was.

I've had differing experiences with them and how good they are at dealing with the problems - the last guy I spoke to yesterday asked me several questions that just didn't seem to make sense, and kept cutting me off when I tried to answer what I thought he was asking and saying no of course he didn't mean that. One of the first people I spoke to kept saying 'I just have to put you on hold', but (probably accidentally) actually wasn't putting me on hold because I could hear him on the other end talking to himself... that was more funny than anything though.

Anyway - I didn't mean to sound like I'm trying to blame them. I have terrible luck with anything like this - all kinds of paperwork hates me and I always seem to end up having 101 problems with things that seem to usually be reasonably straightforward - so it's just a catalogue of more irritating things. We have to move house in April, and I'm also 7 months pregnant, so this is all around the absolute worst time this could possibly have happened.

true,TheAnimus,null,null,"&gt; it probably makes sense to give the pilots the benefit of the doubt until we have more information.

Why?  The family members of the pilots would be wanting to know information as much as anyone else.

Now the decompression scenario you mention is not realistic given the timings of communications with air traffic control and the switching off of reporting systems.  (ACARS then transponder) The fact is that if someone was delirious, they would more likely change the squark to something invalid, rather than switch it off.

The skill required to pull the correct breakers, wouldn't make sense that any of the auto pilot systems (it isn't just 'one') would be left running.

In all honesty, I think it's very fair to complain the Malay authorities have been slow in looking to investigate the pilots.  I say this as a pilot who objected to the condemnation of pilot error before.  Getting to the bottom of this is important, treating the pilots like suspects is acceptable, as they were in command.

""You are quite right that per capita Scottish people received £220 more from the treasury than England did.""

You are quite wrong.

What I said was,

""the Scots received, every man woman and child of them, got £220 more than they paid.""

It's the ""more than they paid"" bit that's important.

They each received ""£1,502"" more than the English.

From your numbers ""the percentage of taxation from England is 85% .... percentage of expenditure is 81% in England"" and the ONS 2011 census make the English 84% of the population.

So, the English pay more than they are and receive back less than they are and they pay.

I suppose that's thanks to the ""bullshit"" Barnett formula.

And Scottish Nationalists consider themselves dogs, fed ""with scraps tossed down from the London table.""

That looks to me like some Scottish tail wagging the United Kingdom's dog.

And you shouldn't say, 

""You would really be shocked at the amount of poverty there actually is in the UK""

Because you have no idea of the relationship I have with poverty or shock.

As for whether there would be less poverty in Scotland if Edinburgh had the international relations and defence portfolios and less money ..... vote for it.

true,DaveBacon,null,null,"I've just shown your post to my (now) wife, and she said, ""When did you post that?!"", because I went though a very similar situation a few years ago.

Part of the reason I left me ex wife was because she was ever so crap with money and was leading us down a path that would make us bankrupt, and despite numerous times me talking to her and going to relate, she wouldn't stop spending money and wouldn't take any responsibility for anything.

Anyway, because of how she was, the option I took was to say to her that if she sold the house (which was under a joint mortgage), she could have the whole proceeds from the sale (once the mortgage was paid), on the condition that I would never have to be in a mortgage with her to provide a home for the kids. I knew that if I was tied into a mortgage with her I'd be tied for years in a financial arrangement that she would not keep her side of and therefore give me a bad credit rating for years. I never wanted any tie with her at all, financial or otherwise, and this was the only way to do it. My solicitor advised against it as I could get some money from the sale if I wanted but to not have ties with her was more important. She got around £100,000 from the sale of the house and lost it all within 18 months of us splitting up. And I wasn't surprised. She even asked me for extra money when she had to pay a speeding fine.

I still pay child maintenance to her at the minimum rate that I can legally get away with as I know she will use it to pay for things for her rather than the kids, and I give the kids money separately, just for them.

And I moved on, found a new partner, got married again, and now am much happier than I was before. I have great relationship with my kids too, I just keep in touch with them directly and arrange visits with them directly so I don't have to have any contact with my ex wife and that makes things much easier and happier.

Main bit of advice - think of your kids. I know you say you must put them first and that is good, but try to separate your relationship with your kids with any disputes you may have with your ex. The first few months for me were really difficult with the kids solely because when I collected them, my ex and I would argue then I'd be left so angry and it would affect my time with the kids.

Gerrards current role:

-defensive positioning

-free kicks

-distribution

Gerrards current strengths:

-mentality (cannot be replaced because a large part of that mental strength is because this is his ONE club)

-Cannon long balls (not many in the world can cross them like Stevie. in fact I can't think of any current player who can hit them like Gerrard)

Thats it. Looking at what he currently brings, they are things that are replaceable with a player like Mvila. The characteristics that make Gerrard special, are impossible to replace. 

You mention Xabi and Pirlo. you are talking about a distributor. Someone who keeps things ticking. Aside from Stevie, Lucas and Allen can play this role well enough. Neither of them are as technically proficient as Xabi/Pirlo/Gerrard, but there are not many who are. Can you name someone who we have a shot at signing who is at that level? IMO the type of player you are seeking is a special player and there are not many playing today.

If someone arises, then great, but in the meantime we should look for someone intelligent and technical who can fit our high energy game. ",0,1395789293,null,0,false,0,cgbw3s5,t3_21d05i,t1_cgbw3s5,t1_cgbunwl,null,1433068081,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Them contributing 2% is a bit of a slap in the face, frankly. I know not every company provides 6% or anything, but 4% at least should be added by them.

15% *is* a lot of your salary, but it's what you need to save if you want to have a comfortable retirement.

Let's say you're 25 right now, with a pension pot of £1000 and gross earnings of £35000. At 4% total, you're going to have a monthly income of £219 if you retire at 65 *if* you don't take any of the lump sum upon retirement.

Does that seem like enough to you?

edit: It's possible that the pension provider have a limit of 15% contributions, if that is you're earning 30k, since 4.5 is 15% of 30k.

* Protection of anonymity for victims of sexual abuse (see recent [Peaches Geldof case](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25145096))
* Withholding military secrets (controversial where the line lies, indisputable that it's necessary in certain situations)

You could also argue that libel laws constitute a de facto form of censorship, despite libel being a civil suit as opposed to a criminal one. Britain reformed its libel law this year so that plaintiff's have to prove actual, serious damage (financial/reputational), but beforehand it led to the suppression of numerous stories that journalists could not stand in court. Indeed part of the point of having a libel law is that people do not make unfounded, damaging comments about others. It's intention is censorial.

The DSS consider £550 a month to be the market rent for a one-bedroom flat - IMO that's a bit low, and many private tenants will be paying £600 or £650, but let's go with that.

A one bedroom flat gives you an income of £6600 per year - four of them, then, match almost exactly [the national average wage.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20442666)

You can't count on the monthly rentable value as pure income, because you have to account for the occasional bad tenant who doesn't pay their rent and you have to redecorate every few years and pay for emergency plumbing.

But we were conservative with the monthly rent, anyway, and I'm only ball-parking it - I haven't raised the matter of reducing tax liabilities by the use of BTL mortgages.

And all that notwithstanding, you're *still* sitting on a remaining £100,000 which buys you a flat for yourself, allowing you to live rent free the rest of your life *on top of your income*.

They paid me 8.50 and hour I think then 8.75. If you stay living at home and don't spend the money elsewhere you can save up a couple grand really fast. Open up a savings account and aim to put a certain percentage of your paycheck in it a month. UK has Starbucks so after you save up several grand ( which may take a year, but you want money for a ticket, moving expenses etc) you can try and get a spot in a uk one. See if you can stay with family as you continue to establish yourself and save up money. I suggest avoiding living in or around London once you actually move out on your own since it's very expensive. Things are cheaper out of the city.

It underlines what Mourinho wants from his players, why he’s sold certain players and bought others, and was particularly impressive given that Ramires and Willian, arguably Chelsea’s best two pressers, were absent.

&gt; ...


&gt; Matic and Luiz applied the most forceful pressure, but Oscar’s more subtle role was crucial and Schurrle was arguably Chelsea’s most involved player – pressing ‘in’ intelligently, slipping the ball through the defence, and making runs in behind.",0,1395794405,null,0,1395794803,0,cgbymew,t3_21df5p,t1_cgbymew,t3_21df5p,null,1433069268,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

Vancouver Whitecaps midfielder Nigel Reo-Coker has emerged as an injury doubt ahead of his club's match this weekend against the Houston Dynamo at BC Place (Saturday, 7 pm ET, MLS Live in US, TSN2 in Canada).

This, after the former Aston Villa and West Ham United star suffered a nasty gash to his face while walking the streets of Vancouver on Sunday.

The club has stated the Englishman was looking elsewhere while walking when he tripped over a bike rack, cutting his face and hitting his head in the process.

“That's unsure at the moment,” assistant coach Martyn Pert told reporters when asked if the injury would keep him out of this weekend's game. “He's had a scrape on his face and the medics will assess whether he has a concussion.

“The initial thing was rest today, and that he does the best things for him.”

The injury was enough to keep Reo-Coker out of Tuesday's training session, and the club's medical staff is attempting to determine whether the player suffered a concussion when he hit his head.

“There's a chance,” Pert responded to a follow up question on the potential concussion. “At the moment there's no definite answer on that.”

Reo-Coker's injury is the latest in a string of off-field accidents which have caused significant distress at times for Vancouver since the club joined Major League Soccer in 2011.",0,1395794502,null,0,false,0,cgbyo3l,t3_21dfeq,t1_cgbyo3l,t3_21dfeq,null,1433069290,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

There are plenty of places in the south that you can buy a nice one-bedroom flat for less than £100,000. 

Moreover, if you're *left* £500,000 then that's not money that's tied up in *your* property - it's money that's literally bequeathed to you to invest.

I've just explained in [another comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/218cyc/cameron_signals_tories_may_raise_inheritance_tax/cgbxsfy) how easily one can invest £500,000 to give a liveable income.

You might not be able to afford to kick back on a Caribbean beach on £26,000pa, but you could certainly do so in Goa, Thailand or the Philippines - heck, you could probably afford a household staff those places.

This investment returns equal to the average UK income - half the population earn less! And you're moaning that you might get so little for doing nothing!? 

It's a reflection on the demographics and privileged world-view that members of this subreddit think it's *so ordinary* to inherit only £500,000 - that puts you well into the [wealthiest 5% of the population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_in_the_United_Kingdom#Wealth), irrespective of your own work or achievements. 

There are literally millions of people in this country who will never own their own homes, who will never in their lives see £500,000 (at today's value).

If you have £500,000 tied up in a property, then *that's a choice you make*.

No doubt it would be a massive lifestyle change to sell up and live a life of ease on only £26,500 a year, but it's certainly something you can afford to do - millions of people in this country manage on less.",0,1395794578,null,0,false,0,cgbypgb,t3_218cyc,t1_cgbypgb,t1_cgbbu4f,null,1433069307,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You may or may not agree with the idea of independence but surely what is beyond dispute is that both sides should be able to make their case and have it heard. Closing down the debate and (in this case) access to information is not compatible with democracy. The situation in schools is little better with complaints that many are blocking access to the YesScotland (YS) website, while allowing access to the Better Together (BT) site. Apparently The Sun has now lodged FOI requests to investigate the full extent of these activities.

Other means of stopping people from gaining access to information is at public events (fetes, carnivals, gala days etc); BT will demand that YS can only open a stall if they too are allowed to open a stall. No problem there; YS have no problem with BT leafleting. However, come the day of the event BT either don't turn up or fail to open their stall thereby preventing YS from opening theirs. Taking this to new heights though is the west coast town of Ayrth where the Prestwick North Community Council canceled a gala day (which many businesses depend on) when it was discovered that they had no legal way of preventing YS from handing out leaflets.

If the interest is high, generally consumers are prompted to save because they get more money from saving. Generally this means they hold on to money and not spend it so the aggregate (total) demand for goods and services (things like food, clothes etc) decrease. If the consumers spends less, this will generally decrease inflation rises. Think of it in terms of a business, you would want to keep prices slightly lower to bring in more customers right? (we will assume the prices are elastic that means if prices goes down then demand for that good goes up). So after everything if interest rates are high or increase, then generally there is low inflation, or even possible deflation (where prices goes down).

Similarly, if interest rates are low, inflation is expected to be higher because consumers are now encouraged to spend and not save.

You will realise that I use the word ""generally"" a lot and that's because nothing is certain in economics (expect for some necessary proofs within a model) and also there are many many many other variables that affects inflation, like the government!. haven't mentioned them here eh?

Now we truly defend as a team, and if we struggle to score we usually draw instead of losing. 

Oscar is already one of the best players in Europe and is still young. He's demonstrated the ability to create and score chances as well as anybody, his decision making just needs to improve (which will come in time). Mata was sort of special in that he seemingly mastered decision making by the time he came to us at 23, which is amazing. Oscar, on the other hand, already has mastered a different mental skill: tactics. For us and Brazil, he executes tactical roles to perfection: drifting wide to allow Hazard and Neymar room in the middle, man-marking opposition midfielders like Pirlo and Arteta, etc. Once he can consistently make good decisions with the ball, he will be a much more complete player than Mata is or ever will be.

That was our biggest problem against West Ham when they just did not get out of their own half. We tried to dribble through our way in but too many bodies denied us 3pts. Thats when we need one brilliant pass. Frankly, and this is my opinion, none of WiZarCar is capable of passing balls like Mata. However, there is no denying that we have been fantastic this season whether we have that ""passer"" or not. Had we kept Mata, we could have used him for matches that required different philosophy. But truth was he was a surplus on the bench and Jose made a correct call. I for one, think Oscar is a very instinctive player. He brilliance comes from his quick decision making and cognitive plan.

As far as you knew, you were not speeding. In fact, it is illegal for your speedometer to ever over-report your speed. Unless a car is 100% accurate, then every driver on that stretch of road with their dial pointing straight at 30 was speeding. It is unreasonable to expect the average person with average knowledge of motor mechanics and vehicle regulations to know the legally introduced bias of speedometers to under report their speed to such an extent that they could be prosecuted, yet their car to be in perfect working order under the law. 

Another angle you could explore is the tolerance of the equipment used. If it is not accurate within 5mph, then you could potentially he travelling at or under the limit.

And the fantastic intangibles that he brings to the squad cannot be measured.

But, more importantly to me, is the incredible narrative, the wonderful story. As Brendan Rodgers stated: ""[Winning the player-of-the-year award] would be a wonderful step forward in his life and career.""

The general story line for Luis Suarez to me is:

* Brilliant but petulant player (handball World Cup, biting incident in Holland, etc) coming into the Premier League.
* Then from nuisance to racist.
* From racist to savage.
* From savage to a racist-savage *and* a traitor last summer.
* And then Luis Suarez... changed man, changed player, letting his actions on the field do the talking (fewer dives, little controversy thus far, etc) and, ultimately, player-of-the-year.

If Suarez wins player-of-the-year, I really hope LFC encourages Luis Suarez to do a number of interviews and feature pieces all around the UK to really get people outside of Liverpool and their supporters to know the real Suarez.

We have been by far the worst-bitten club in the league, and as recently as a week ago we had 0 centerbacks.  There have been lots of reasons for our problematic season, and our injury record is one of them.

But as of today, and probably for the first time since Capoue went down on September 1, we're in better health than they are.  Right now, their injuries are much worse than ours.  Not worse than ours were at certain points in the season, but worse than ours now. 

As for Lamela, we can agree to disagree, which is reflective of the overall lack of consensus about Lamela.  For my part, I think he has *worlds* of potential, but his actual performances this season (which have been sadly few) have not been good, bar one game against a weak opponent.  In terms of overall play, I think Lennon adds more than Lamela *right now*.  Once Lamela has had an extended run of games I think he will start to come good, at which point he will indeed be a clear starter over Lennon.  But right now, he's a development project, not a fixture in the XI of a team that is desperate for points in the final run-in.  And not nearly the impact player that Walcott, Ramsey, or Koscielny are ...

true,avro,,Famigilia Leeds United,"When reading the league's decision with my lawyer hat on I feel Cellino has a good case for appeal. These relate in particular to the league's decision making on whether it is a valid conviction for the purposes of the OAD test.

1. Point 2.3 - The league flat out admit their Italian counsel advise them that the conviction is not final (and should not be used for the determination of this test).  They then go onto disregard this advice.

1. Point 2.4.1 becomes largely irrelevant as a result of this admission. In addition - who advised the league on this point (their ruling does not say). Were they competent, qualified or otherwise and were the league reasonable in relying on this advice? 

1. Point 2.4.2. - The league quotes the Italian constitution's Art. 27 as supportive of Cellino then attempts to trump Article 27 by reference to a third party European journal of criminology that has no legal power under Italian law. The league should be relying on the laws of the jurisdiction not on external commentary of those laws.

1. Point 2.4.3 - is speculative subjective decision making and can largely be disregarded. 

There is more to go on. Particularly when we consider dishonesty and the use of dictionary definitions by the FL but I'll cover those later.


Not to mention that you could submit the process for judicial review particularly on the grounds that the football league were:

* a) prejudiced in their decision making process by the media;
* b) unreasonably slow in their decision making process;
* c) acted ultra vires when requesting information beyond that required for the OAD test from Cellino and GFH; and
* d) the FL have unreasonably disregarded the advice of legal counsel in their decision making process and have therefore failed to act properly.

Notwithstanding, it's no small wonder the lawyers for Cellino were confident of passing the OAD. It just surprises me that the FL has had to clutch at straws so badly in order to deny him. 

I speculate here - but perhaps it's an exercise in saving face? the league knows it can't really stop Cellino, it just wants to be seen to be doing so to prevent bad PR / reaction from the media and knows it will likely have it's decision overturned on appeal.

**TLDR; The FL's justifications for Cellino's failure of the OAD are confused, sloppy and weak at best. Cellino has good grounds for appeal and relatively strong chances for success.**

true,RoscoeTheDog13,US,usa,"Overall, I think keeping Oscar and selling Mata and KDB for a combined 50m+ was the correct call. I think that Oscar is a much more instinctual player whereas Mata and de Bruyne are much more measured players. They are calmer and more patient. Even Oscar has admitted that his first instinct when picking up the ball is to shoot. Of course, this results in some brilliant goals, like the one against Juventus when he played the ball around Pirlo with his back to goal, ran around him and placed it into the top corner. Oscar's defensive style, of always giving 100%, putting in some pretty good tackles, is what Mourinho values over the ability to play that last killer pass. That is the skill that Mourinho's tactics require. 

On the other hand, I agree with your friend when he says that we need a player who can pick out that one killer pass against the teams that will park the bus against us. That's why I would like to see us really nurture a player like Josh McEachran (although he looks to be playing deeper in midfield, as well as possibly not being able to make the grade at Chelsea) or buy a player like Mata or KDB but for much cheaper. We need a player who will be content with limited minutes against the teams that will put 10 men behind the ball because that innate ability to unlock a defense with a pass is invaluable against teams like that. Unfortunately, I think that ability is held by only a certain number of elite players, and we just sold two of them. 

Maybe Oscar, or even Hazard or Willian, can diversify his game and develop that ability. After all, all of our attacking midfielders are very young and have their whole careers in front of them under the tutelage of one of the best coaches in the world. Maybe a player like Lucas Piazon (who I rate very highly and I think is destined to be a star) is that player we need. Maybe the club's extensive scouting network is identifying this player as we speak. I think that both you and your friend have good points, and this is definitely an issue that the club must address in the long term.

**TL;DR** Oscar suits Mourinho's tactics the best, but against the sides who will park the bus, that pressing style is not needed. So I do believe that we need a player who can play that killer pass, but who is also ok with playing limited minutes.

true,winter_mute,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"&gt;Moreover, if you're left £500,000 then that's not money that's tied up in your property - it's money that's literally bequeathed to you to invest.

Except it's probably not going to go towards investments.  A large chunk is going to go towards paying off your mortgage; or buying another property further up the ladder - opening up a place for someone else to get on the property market.

&gt;This investment returns equal to the average UK income

Bit silly to quote average UK figures when we're talking about the south.  £26,000 will go much further in Middlesborough than it will in the M4 corridor.  

&gt;It's a reflection on the demographics and privileged world-view that members of this subreddit think it's so ordinary to inherit only £500,000 - that puts you well into the wealthiest 5% of the population, irrespective of your own work or achievements. 

And your answer to this percieved inequality is to put 4 or 5 flats in the hands of private landlords?  Plus I'm pretty sure that your comment is basically talking gross returns; forgetting agency fees, property upkeep, repairing damage tenants have caused etc...  Your example also assumes that the landlord is going to buy a one-bedroomed flat for him / herself.  Useless if you want a family.  Buying a flat isn't a sound investment anyway - you're basically buying a box on someone else's land.  I don't know where you're looking, but if I'm only spending 100,000 on a flat in the East Midlands, I'm looking at buying in crappy areas.  God know what kind of place £100,000 gets you in the environs of London or a commuter town.   

&gt;Goa, Thailand or the Philippines 

If your idea of being well-off relies on moving to 3rd world dives to be able to afford the manner of living you want; then you are not well-off.

It's a reflection of the demographic *of the country*, and the state of the property market that more and more people are being caught by inheritance tax.  This isn't untaxed wealth we're talking about; it's been taxed as it's been earned, taxed as it's been saved, taxed as it's been spent.  These people have managed to put what's left after all of that into a property (no doubt with an exorbitant mortgage these days).

true,[deleted],null,null,"Sad to see an honest question being downvoted. I was around in the 80s, so I'll give my perspective as a recovering anti-Man Utd chap.

Man Utd have a stunning history; really stellar. And tragic. Munich, George Best, European Cups; what's not to be in awe of? At first in the 80s, I loved to watch them play; they were a young, dynamic, exciting team, playing glorious football.

Then came Cantona.

A genius, there's no doubting that - an absolute god with the ball. But a cheat. What made it so bad was that he didn't even need to cheat; he was twice as good as any other player on the pitch. And it wasn't just his diving, but the fact that he would kick defenders when they were down - for no reason.

Ferguson used to back him to the hilt. Then, of course, Ferguson threw a hissy fit and refused to give interviews to the BBC for many years because they criticised him on Match of the Day for picking young players (""[You can't win anything with kids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Es-RIBnba8)""). A comment which was proved to be wrong and retracted in full-on humble mode by Alan Hanson. But Ferguson still refused interviews for years afterwards, acting like a spoiled child.

The team went from strength to strength and - now here is the other big problem - attracted fans from all over the country. Not real fans; just people who liked to be on the winning side. They would have (and probably did) support Liverpool ten years earlier.

That was sickening, and my home town (in the Midlands) had a team of our own, but the town was awash with Man Utd shirts. People who couldn't be bothered to support their own team because that would be an effort and they wouldn't win as much (hardly at all, to be fair).

That permeating, nauseating atmosphere that those faux fans generated made people resent Man Utd themselves (along with the Cantona and Fergie shit, obviously). And the players. A player was tainted if he played for Utd. My friend said it best:

""When Mark Hughes left Man Utd and joined Chelsea, he stopped being a cunt and became simply *very committed*.""

He didn't play any differently; but he was perceived differently, from the moment he pulled on the blue shirt.

Nowadays, I can't stand Chelsea; for mostly the same reasons, but I have come to accept and admire Man Utd, and I wish them well. Their attitude has changed. 

But with Chelsea, it's not just the egomaniac they have in charge which makes me dislike them; I lived in Tottenham for a while and *every* time Chelsea came over, the *entire* train station was left covered with racist graffiti. They covered pretty much all the racial bases, and the fans would racially abuse people on the train.

Chelsea can't not have known about the graffiti. With the CCTV, it would be simple to find the people responsible. They did nothing. At all.

When they got [a Jewish manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avram_Grant#Chelsea)...

&gt; Bruce Buck, chairman of Chelsea, claimed they had received points of view which are racist and anti-semitic. Buck stated: ""[This] unfairly smears the reputation of the vast majority of the Chelsea fans who rightly do not want to be associated with such activity""

Really? Go take a look at White Heart Lane station after the Chelsea fans disembark; the club is already associated with that, as are the fans. *And you can't not know that*. And you did nothing -  *nothing* - to change it. Well, you know what? You reap what you sew. And there you are moaning about people acting in the way that you have implicitly condoned for several years to my own personal knowledge.

I think that's when I started hating Chelsea and started to forgive Man Utd. There was a bigger evil in football, and I started supporting Man Utd whenever they played Chelsea. That was the beginning of the end of my hatred for Man Utd.",0,1395821672,null,0,false,0,cgc88cn,t3_21cw0h,t1_cgc88cn,t1_cgbw293,null,1433073861,12,false,BritishSuccess,t5_2vlyo,12

I mean, I don't know much about the place, but I've read some horror stories of the way women are treated in India, yet never of Indian women being granted refugee status because of spousal abuse. 

Wikipedia tells me that ""Mauritius is highly ranked for democracy and for economic and political freedom"" and [this publication](http://www.refworld.org/docid/42df613f29.html) by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada says that, with the '97 Protection from Domestic Violence Act, Mauritius became the second country in the Southern African Development Community to have to have enacted a comprehensive legislative program to protect women from violence.

So that seems pretty progressive, to me - suggesting the country is at least ahead of the standards of the region - but that law was passed 15 years ago, so you've think further progress had been made by now. The same report makes some criticisms of the state's spousal abuse protections, but says a lot of positive things, too - e.g. a 2004 constitutional judgement that an abusive husband can be expelled from the marital home, that the Mauritius Police Force includes a Children and Women Protection Unit is now 20 years established and that a national Mauritian newspaper states ""many communities"" have domestic violence shelters.

About the jerseys, I'll tell you something: Brazil has no star anymore. Ronaldinho isn't a superstar right now (he is playing for Atlético Mineiro), and Ronaldo, Rivaldo, Roberto Carlos, Juninho Pernambucano (this guy is my hero), they all got retired. This way, now we only have Neymar (who is a growing star) and Kaká, who is in bad shape for almost five years. The press here is massively stupid, and for commercials and political interest, they don't want a Brazil without idols. So, they sell Kaká and Neymar as if they are kings. The result of this is: People here really thinks that Neymar is the best of the world and Kaká still is a great player. That is why you see a lot of jerseys from these two.

Still, in Minas Gerais, the state where Ronaldinho plays, it still is very common to see jerseys from him in the street.

Studying abroad is one of the few opportunities many people have to immerse themselves longer-term a foreign city or culture. Choosing Belfast to spend a year over all the other places in Western Europe would be a massive folly, so it is excellent that OP is doing this research now. 

Belfast has nothing to offer when compared to any other major UK city or Dublin. In terms of drawing in international visitors, Belfast piggybacks onto the rest of Ireland (hence why the Irish tourism board is an all-island body). If you remove the rest of Ireland from the equation - all Belfast has to suck in tourists on its own terms is how it built the worlds most notorious sinking ship. And boy, they won't let you forget it. They're flogging that dead horse alright, because it's the only. thing. they've. got. In fact, they've started to name things after it (including a 'Titanic Quarter') - although the irony of doing this seems to be lost on most living there. 

Other than that, you can see the legacy of hundreds of years of civil conflict and division in the form of paramilitary murals and peace walls. Good for a long weekend, but any more than that and you'll be picking your eyeballs out with matchsticks. I once booked a week's holiday to Belfast, and ended up spending an extra £100 to book a flight at short notice *to leave early*. 

I think the one reason to move to Belfast if you are foreign, though, would be if you are a poor yet want to learn English. The cost of rent is among the lowest of all UK cities. The obvious downside to that is you end up talking a fairly ridiculous dialect of English with words and phrases totally unrecognised outside of Northern Ireland. And you'd have to watch your back in loyalist areas, where anybody not deemed to be white, protestant, British, loyalist and unionist is effectively considered to be unwelcome.

I still maintain that this is irrelevant - visa status has nothing to do with one's need for asylum.

If a refugee were to paddle over here on a homemade raft, they would likely have no visa at all - in that case the same argument could be used, ""she has no visa, the UK has every right to send her home"".

If a Russian political dissident applied for asylum here, or a Chinese author famous for having written books critical of the regime, we would not be turning them away because they arrived here on a tourist visa - not if their lives, and those of their family, were at in genuine danger if we sent them back home.

Danger to life and limb is the only criteria under which asylum claims should be assessed. These women should be sent home because they're safe back there (if that's the case), and because their lives are not in any danger, *not because they arrived here on tourist visas.*

This reminds me a lot of the US Republican claim that government is inherently wasteful and incompetent, which they proceed to prove by getting voted in, running things inefficiently and fucking up the business of the state and then use that failure as ideological ammunition for their ""small government"" propaganda.

That situation is even more bizarre (because people vote in a party who say their job is fundamentally impossible to do properly and then when they prove to be incompetent at it people credit their opinions *more*, instead of asking whether perhaps they're simply incompetent to rule), whereas in this case the government can merely blame the ""inefficiency"" and ""waste"" on the existing system and all the administrations that have come before them instead of their own inadequacy.  Still, the flavour of ""we claim it can't be done, watch us fuck it up and then credit us for being right that it couldn't be done"" are definitely similar.

In a sane country *nobody would vote in* a party which claims the thing its elected to do is impossible (especially when it's been happily chugging along and basically working already for most of a century)... but alas this is evidently not a sane country.

Instead we elect people who flat-out state that they're too incompetent to administrate things, then when they announce it's not working and seek to ""reform"" it, we credit them with being ""right"" instead of just facing the probability that they were either always incompetent, or intentionally allowed it to fail for ideological reasons.",0,1395830545,null,0,false,0,cgc9leg,t3_21ed8h,t1_cgc9leg,t3_21ed8h,null,1433074505,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,hotcod,null,null,"&gt;I'm obviously only talking from my perspective of it all. It really was just 'awareness' on my newsfeed, none were donating during the first couple of days. And in my personal experience, the 'bitching' people were encouraging them as part of their criticism, it being along the lines of 'what use is this, why not actually donate or share links instead of posting stupid pictures'.

More often than not without providing information on how to donate or donating themselves. It was the charites and a push by people who did donate to get others to donate that made the difference not the bitching.

&gt;The main point of my comment was that most people only really take part when it's a fad, such as this. 

You can always do more, it doesn't mean that anything less is worthless. 

&gt;Then they use the thank-you pictures from Cancer Research and the like as some way to try and defend against the criticism and ignore that fact it wasn't even the original goal, just a daft fad with an awareness label.

Or as a way to encourage other to donate, which is how it started with my friends. I mean yes in part posting proof of donating was a way to deflect criticism but it doesn't follow that the donation was made because of it. 

&gt;I know how cynical I'm sounding, but 9/10 people I know and those on newsfeed seem to be completely ignorant to the world around them. None of them have an interest in most things bar their personal lives for the years and years I've known them. So when this came along, it seemed a bit fake of them to be honest. Especially as they've never seemed to care openly before. But as I said I'm speaking from my experience the people I know. Might be different elsewhere.

So what? Why do you give more of a fuck about why the shitty people on your friends list (you might want to get better friends by the way) donated to charity instead of being happy about the fact that these people who might not otherwise have donated to charity did so?

This hasn't happened in this case, which is worrying in itself.  However when you look at the timing of the events, it's very credible that they were intentionally performed by someone in the flight deck who was familiar with the type.

RT is Radio Telephony, in this case they were leaving the service area of an Air Traffic Controller.  Before saying good night, apparently a system which sends automated data back via sat link was switched off.

The transponder was then no longer SQUARKing, transponders respond to radar with a pong (ping is the are you there, pong is the echo reply).  Transponders carry a bunch of info, it differs to the class/mode they are.  Mode-c and higher have a SQUARK code, this is a 4 digit number, some are reserved for certain things, 7700 is distress, if this is received by any air traffic controller, even one who isn't providing service, it lights the screen like an angry Christmas tree.  If no further responses are detected, it doesn't matter, it stays there, angry looking.  7500 is much the same, but is used for hijacking (75' we're been taken alive, 77' we're going to heaven, 76' lost com).

So if the transponder failed, fair enough, but they have a backup one, which you would switch too, if you had any other problems, had just lost a vital unit, you would have thought they would have the 2 or 3 seconds it takes to press 7700.

However, maybe they had other things on their mind, fair enough, but they didn't use the radio either.  They have 4+ com boxes these are physically separate, isolated systems.  Given how many other craft were in the area, the fact no one heard anything on 121.5 suggests they didn't try.

The fact that what ever happened was enough to create such 'disruption' to these isolated, separated systems, yet not enough to make the plane non-air worthy at they very least, or prevent auto-pilot if you are suggesting decompression, is frankly, improbable.

Hence why I am saying that the pilots should be investigated.  I'm not saying they did it, we can't possibly say that.

That's a silly statement. People said the same about the bra-colour thing, and were still doing so even after it had raised money. The idea then, as now, was to encourage people to donate, which they have - not sure how you can then assert that people 'only' donated because of criticism after the event...that's a bit like criticising Red Nose Day because people haven't donated in advance or at hour zero.

&gt;Remember, it was just 'breast cancer awareness' originally, not actively donating.

Errr....the idea was to raise awareness to encourage people to donate. Which it did. This wasn't a new idea, it's been done successfully before, and reddits' disapproval didn't seem to make much difference (apart from redditors who could have spent the time doing it themselves instead of using more energy on insisting that it would fail).

&gt; If they all donated from the start, or everyone when the donations did start 

Considering how desperately some were insisting that no money would be raised at all, maybe it's time to go with the flow instead of picking holes. In this case, they just raised £8 million and you're still complaining?

&gt;But yeah posting a link should be enough.

Which in hindsight doesn't seem to be entirely necessary. It's not aimed at someone who never leaves their screen - it's designed to get people talking, which, of course, it did. And in any case, it's not hard to find a link yourself once you want to donate - unless you're going to assert that all the donations only came from people who provided links.

&gt;People don't care unless it's some fad to go along with and be a part of, no one bothers to read and click informative links.

Wow, another sweeping statement. And even ignoring that, if it's down to one or the other, do you want to raise money or educate? You are aware that your summary could be applied to *any* TV telethon/ charity event?

It was the sort of result that we just couldn't expect to hold on to. Our play had been fast and efficient, but I couldn't help but feeling that there wasn't enough grit to see us through a game like that. 

Walters bottled it, yeah, but when Mignolet got his hand to it...

And then he saved another...

And moments later, the ball is miles away from danger. 

That's when I honestly knew this season would be different. It wasn't 0-5 Tottenham, or the Norwich drubbing, or that oh-so-close bout versus City - it was a 1-0 game against Stoke.

""The number of doctors employed by NHS trusts rose by 6.9% over the four years to last October, to 105,056. Within this group, the number of consultants rose nearly twice as fast, up 13.2% to 40,709. Numbers of qualified ambulance and technical staff rose slightly. Meanwhile, nursing numbers initially fell, leading to criticism from Labour leader Ed Miliband. But numbers have since recovered to 310,924, up 994 (0.3%) over the four years, with clinical support staff following a similar pattern.

But there have been big NHS job cuts in one area: infrastructure support staff, down 10.2% over the period. Within this group, the people suffering the biggest cuts have been non-senior managers, down 18.5% to 24,349, and senior managers, down 22.1% to 10,197. Many left as the result of the government's phasing out of primary care trusts and strategic health authorities, completed last April.""",0,1395836815,null,0,1395846767,0,cgcautn,t3_21ed8h,t1_cgcautn,t1_cgc97h0,null,1433075099,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

My cousins who are born Irish speakers, they only speak Irish to each other. They never speak it outside the family. I asked my cousins why they did this when I was home a few years ago and they said they didn't want to be labeled Republicans.

Also, it probably has something to do with the arrogant/dislikable players you've had in the past.

Ashley Young is always diving, Rooney is/was a petulant child and so was Beckham up to a point. He was always going to be a scapegoat after that incident in the World Cup.

Trying to have a reasoned debate with most of the United fans in this area about football was impossible.

Honestly, if you enjoyed any part of the CBT, or think you may enjoy riding bikes, then book another CBT. It’s super easy to make tons of mistakes when you have very little experience riding along the roads, but the vast majority of the mistakes can be ironed out by getting more practice and just taking things easy.

On your 2nd CBT, you will likely get a bit more time on the off-road bit (while instructors are explaining controls etc to others). See if you can mainly practice turns in the off-road bit. IMO the 3 main things that help with turns are to have good clutch control, look where you want to end up, and keeping your speed in check (cover the brakes and gently slow down a bit whenever the bike feels like it’s going away from you). Also, the CBT instructors will know you better than any of us, so give them £20 and have a nice chat with them – they will be able to give you specific and helpful advice. Don’t worry too much about what happened, but definitely learn from it as you move forward, an extra £20 is a very cheap price for the amount of advice and real world experience this will grant you. If CBT’s were longer, EVERYONE new to motorcycles would have a hairy moment! But the on-road portion doesn't last ***that*** long, and most people learn things the hard way later on, on their own bikes.

One thing we noticed is that if you have an older wireless card you'll only get about 20 Mbps. The newest hub is a dual band router so it broadcasts on both 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz. The thing about 2.4GHz is that it can get a lot of interference which causes your speeds to vary quite a lot.

We found that the best solution was to go into the router's settings and split the broadcast signal into two separate SSIDs. One for the 5GHz band and the other with the 2.4GHz band.

In our experience the 5GHz gives us consistently high speeds whereas the 2.4GHz can vary wildly from 1Mbps to 55Mbps (avg around 18 - 20 Mbps).",0,1395840692,null,0,false,0,cgcc09y,t3_219ep0,t1_cgcc09y,t3_219ep0,null,1433075705,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1

He bought a laptop from PC-world, meaning he owed them £1,500.  The finance company loaned him that money (which went straight to PC world to pay for the laptop)

From PC World's point of view, everything is paid off.  Then he returns it.  He doesn't get a refund (because he doesn't think to ask for one, because why would you? He's not paid out any money yet), so from PC World's point of view, they got paid *and* they got the laptop back.

From the finance company's point of view, they paid PC World £1,500 so they want this guy to pay back the loan.

Basically, I'd argue this is all PC World's fault.  They *must* have procedures for returning and refunding of items on credit, and it's the fault of the moronic manager who refused to deal with it properly (refusing to offer a refund, shipping it back to the guy etc.)

To address your points:


1) No, i wouldnt say the island was homophobic. Although it does have a very limited 'gay market' so to speak. A few of my close friends are homosexual, and they often feel that there isnt a lot for them in the way of clubs/bars/enough other homosexual people to meet. But i wouldnt say you would be discrimated against for it. not at all.


2) From an outsiders view it is ok. My mother is a doctors PA. and she likes her job. We have no NHS style thing here. But im sure youll read a bit about that if you are intersted in a job here.

3) Its more expensive, but there are no bandwidth caps. 40mb VDSL is £28p/m. But i get constant 25-35mbs speed tests. So its not bad

4) Yeah i think it is. definately very low crime rate compared the UK. Also cheaper fuel and insurance, so you can have a newer nicer car for the same price as the UK etc.

5) Flights/getting off the island are the most expensive bits. But we have a few different airlines. I have a friend with family in Edinburgh, when he goes home they tend to get the boat to Poole and then get the train up to Edinburgh. But i know he has flown before

Blue Islands
Aurigny
Flybe

Are the 3 main airlines that operate from here, so google them and make up some mock details with flights to Edinburugh and see how that compares to your costs.

6) I dont know about costs, as i have health insurance through my job. but if your worried about costs like that again, health insurance isnt too expensive here and that generally covers you for x visits a year etc.

Millions wait over a week to see a GP because that is the model which is most appropriate for GP surgeries.  General practice is not crisis or emergency care and people can wait to see a GP, or alternatively, use the same day appointment system.  Private healthcare providers would not necessarily change this system since there is nothing inherently wrong with it.

2)I like Juan Mata a lot, as well as Chicharito, not the biggest fan of Rooney though, I think he's kind of whiny. 

3) I honestly have no clue why we're so awful at home, the best guess I can think of is maybe they get a bit too relaxed and don't chase the game as much? 

4) I definitely feel like Lambert's headed in the right direction. Once the players mature and gain some consistency I think we'll be competing for Europe places. As for the damage caused I think it was fairly severe. We kept spending money but our league position only got worse. 

5) I think to be competing with the top clubs again we will need to stick with Lambert and let his plan play its course. Eventually we'll need more financial flexibility as well obviously.

6) Well I wouldn't say it annoys me all that much but it can sometimes. Not so much because of them competing but because it feels like we could be up there too.

7) I think any one of the top 4 could take it really. Had you asked me a few months ago I would've said Arsenal but I have to go with either Chelsea or Liverpool. I'm partial to Liverpool though, Suarez and Sturridge don't show many signs of slowing. 

8) I think y'all won't move to much up or down the table. If anything, you'll finish sixth but I think you'll stick around at 7th. Optimistically I'd say 9th but more realistically we'd finish 10th-11th.

This is a horse shit explanation from the manager. It doesn't mean anything.

As someone who's involved in interfacing with the techies in web UI design, my hypothesis is: 

Someone in marketing says ""we should have this autofill to make it more convenient for the user"" which is a noble goal.

The issue then gets pushed over to the developers, probably located in places with low quality standards, poor English comprehension, and probably wet behind the ears with a lack of comprehension of the pitfalls of a string-and-sellotape development approach - if you want to get all Marxist about it, alienation from the end product of his labour, thus compounding all the prior-mentioned problems.

~~So whoever is developing the function chooses (for convenience or out of ignorance) a unique database key that is merely the first and last name of the user - because of course no two people would ever have the same first and last name - instead of something completely unique such as, say, the fucking phone number or a username/password combination.~~ Edit: this didn't happen.

true,Paludosa2,null,null,"&gt; Is a referendum required for all political decisions, or just the ones you don't personally agree with?

This is a very common complaint about holding referendums. Let's compare, for example, in [Voting in Switzerland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_in_Switzerland)

&gt;*Switzerland's voting system is unique among modern democratic nations in that Switzerland practices* **direct democracy** *(also called semi-direct democracy), in which any citizen may challenge any law approved by the parliament or, at any time, propose a modification of the federal Constitution. In addition, in most cantons all votes are cast using paper ballots that are manually counted. At the federal level, voting can be organised for*:

* Elections (election of the Federal Assembly)
* Mandatory referendums (votation on a modification of the constitution made by the Federal Assembly)
* Optional referendums (referendum on a law accepted by the Federal Assembly and that collected 50'000 signatures of opponents)
* Federal popular initiatives (votation on a modification of the constitution made by citizens and that collected 100'000 signatures of supporters)

&gt;**Approximately four times a year, voting occurs over various issues; these include both Referendums, where policies are directly voted on by people**, *and elections, where the populace votes for officials. Federal, cantonal and municipal issues are polled simultaneously, and the majority of people cast their votes by mail.*  

[Popular initiative (Switzerland)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_popular_initiative)

&gt;*A popular initiative allows the people to suggest law in Switzerland on a federal, cantonal and municipal level. On a federal and cantonal level it suggests changing the respective constitution. Besides referendum and, in some cantons, recall, it is means of direct democracy in Switzerland. It is different from the mandatory referendum in that the proposition to change the constitution comes from the population and not from the parliament.*

So you see, there are different ways to engage in democracy and political decision-making between the people and the government. What you're insinuating is that a vocal minority want their views expressed over a subject that does not take an equal and balanced point of view that other people's views might just as equally be relevant/valid and hence an avalanche of referendums is the only logical outcome: IE illogical reasoning.

Well according to polls, between 70-80% of the electorate indicate they would like a Referendum on the EU question. Some headlines:

&gt;*ICM poll for Open Europe has found that 86% of UK voters want a referendum.*

&gt;*Some 70% of voters want a vote on Britain's EU membership, Guardian/ICM poll shows.*

&gt;*Given an in-out referendum on EU membership tomorrow, 50% would vote “out”*

&gt;*UK: EU referendum, poll shows 49% would vote for UK withdrawal*

For very quick example. This was even brought up in the House of Lords debate over the EU Referendum Member's Bill.

I'd argue if we had a different political system as per the Swiss with more Direct Democracy would already have managed to generate a referendum on the issue.

&gt;*""One further question, hypothetically even if we did have a referendum, but the decision went against your wishes, what then? Another one every year until you get the ""right answer""?""*

To Paraphrase: ""Can't you shut-up and I doubt you will shut-up if there is a referendum?""

There will always be a proportion of the electorate who will want a referendum on the EU, because:

1) The right to Self-Determination under International Law of a recognized government and the people it represents: See Scotland, Catalunya, Venice, Flanders and more. There will always be people who contest the people who are elected to vote them in a Democracy. What is asked for is directly represented elected government of those people.
2) The EU has changed from the EEC -&gt; EC -&gt; EU -&gt; USE? People were only given a vote on the EEC. At each stage national powers were lost and therefore it should be clear that people were not given a vote on either of those stages involving signing of the Treaty of Amsterdam, Maastricht, Nice and Lisbon. Anyone under the age of 57 (&gt;50% of the population) has never voted on the EEC, EC or the EU. So my question is why don't we hold post-legislative referendums on all the preceding then we'll have a referendum on the USE which is planned for the future.
3) To apply your logic: Should the leaders of this country provide referendums for all the times they promised a referendum and broke that promise?

""The referendum should go ahead in any event. Of course it should."" — Rt Hon. Tony Blair MP, Prime Minister, speech to the House of Commons, 20th April 2004

4) There was a referendum in Holland and France and Ireland over the EU Constitution and the EU rejected it. It then became the Lisbon Treaty and they were not given a referendum again.

So yes, I would be *""agitating""* until we leave the EU even if a non-Brexit result was achieved. It's called democracy in case you had forgotten that that means being in a country with people who's political views you don't share but accept for the time they are represented as a majority in government.

The detention centre where they're being held, Yarl's Wood, is frankly something I would expect to see in some Orwellian universe. The fact that people let these things go on in detention centres because this part of society has no voice is a disgusting indictment of our collective social xenophobia which always raises its ugly head in times of economic downturn.

true,CastrosExplodinCigar,,Randalstown,"I am not missing the point. Northern Ireland and Ireland as a whole is already diverse. It is a global diversity not a self contained diversity. There is a Polish community, a Latvian community, a Chinese community, an Australian community. There are loads of communities on the island of Ireland and I welcome and support that.

Depoliticising the language. Then maybe certain organisations should have the courtesy not to use it while talking to non Irish speakers. I would not use my French to speak to a non french speaker because I consider it rude. Nor would I send them a memo written in French which they would then have to pay to have translated.

As for choice, that's fine. This is the last time I will repeat myself. I have no problem with people wanting to learn Irish. What I do have an issue with is tax payers money which could be better spent in schools, hospitals, roads, infrastructure, helping small businesses (the list is endless) being spent on a language which is nothing short of a romantic idyl. 

There should not be a mass translation service in the NI government. It does not serve the people of Northern Ireland AS A WHOLE. It serves a small minority who can very easily access and read documents in the English language.

Promoting Irish is not promoting diversity. If someone in the private sector wants to apply for a government grant to start Irish language classes, let them write a business proposal and good luck to them. If someone wants to teach Irish in the back room of a pub every evening. Good luck to them. That's great, I'm all for learning new skills and new languages. It's not my choice but good for them.

Last year, as my contract with them was due to expire, I went to one of their stores to look at new phone models. I didn't see anything I liked so I left and decided to join Orange instead. 

When I called 3 to cancel my contract, they told me I had apparently renewed my contract and bought a Samsung S4 (I'm way too cheap for a nice phone like that) on that same day I visited the store. I went to the store to find out what was going on, when I had visited before the clerk had taken my details so she could tell me when my contract due to expire.

Anyway it seems like she'd somehow used my details when selling a phone to someone else. It took a couple of weeks to resolve, I had to meet the area manager personally and show him identification. Plus quite a few tedious long phone calls to 3, compounded by the actual 3 store not answering their phone, meaning I had to personally visit the store to enquire into progress.

Eviction by a freeholder

It is very rare for a freeholder to repossess a leasehold property. Your freeholder can normally only evict you if all of the following points are met:

    you break one of the conditions of your lease (such as paying ground rent)
    your lease says it can be ended ('forfeited')
    the freeholder follows the correct procedure.

The freeholder has to give you formal written notice and get a court order before you can be evicted. Even if s/he can prove you broke your lease, you can ask the court to stop the eviction. Contact a solicitor immediately if you are in this situation - find one through the Legal Adviser Finder.

Source: http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_advice/leaseholders_rights/overview_of_leasehold_law

of course on the other hand if they were successful in evicting you from a 99 year lease you would go from owning a home to having nothing, losing thousands of pounds worth of property.

They can call the Council to take action for noise pollution but that would be against the people living there, not you nor your property.

true,kilowhisky,stpp,St Peter Port,"My wife is a nurse on a medical ward here and I'm friends with quite a few of them so I'll take a bash at this too:

No I don't get the impression that the island is homophobic, if anything I'd say the majority are quite laid back on the matter, it's just that there isn't much of a market here. There are a few gay male nurses working at the hospital and they all seem to get along fine.

The health service here is good and is well respected on the island, it offers a very good level of service. As an employer, they have their problems every now and then but overall they're quite good and nowhere near as bad as the NHS. The wages for nursing staff here are quite decent and staff accomadation is available at heavily subsidised rates compared to renting privately. The thing that people find quirky compared to UK hospitals is that there is only 1 doctor based there peremenantly in A&amp;E, the rest are part of a seperate company, all consultant level (no junior doctors on the island) and are based in a seperate building. They pop in and do their rounds in the morning and run clinics at their seperate premises, but are on call for the rest of the day and night for the hospital, so generally nurses are left in charge of the wards.

Broadband speeds are ok most of the time, depending on where you are on the island and time of day. If you're in the staff accomadation you'd be limited to the standard broadband (16MB) and have to share it with everyone there. If you rent privately then you could go for the 40mb option as tris203 mentioned.

It's about £40+ for a GP visit on the island without health insurance, but if you're referred onto a consultant or admitted it's free. Ambulances aren't run by the government, you can get an ambulance subscription for around £25 per year that would cover you for any use, if you don't have that then a single use is over £250. A&amp;E also costs, its around £90 depending on what the issue is and what investigations / treatments are done and costs more on evening / weekends.


If you want to know anything more feel free to send me a message, or I can ask my wife some questions if you want to know anything from her experience.

Doctor Who is surprisingly spotty on Netflix (even on DVD), but the last time I checked the entire Key to Time series (which spanned an entire season) was streamable on Netflix. it is excellent, and features the introduction of Romana. She is an earlier regeneration, played by the fantastic Mary Tamm.

Some of my personal favorites:

* The Ark in Space / the Sontaran Experiment (really, two different stories, but intertwined)

* Genesis of the Daleks - the origin story

* Planet of Evil

* Pyramids of Mars (particularly excellent)

* The Deadly Assassin - see Gallifrey!

* Full Circle (the first of the E-Space serials)

* State of Decay - space vampires. Yes, space vampires. (also, E-Space pt 2)

* Warriors' Gate - E-Space pt 3

* The Keeper of Traken - the return of The Master

* Logopolis - Baker's last episode as The Doctor. But the way had been prepared for.... (you'll know what that means when you watch it)

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"I would love to see a manager for 5 years, but....i don't know that is a reasonable expectation any more.

In England's top 4 divisions there are 3 managers who have been with there team for 5 seasons or more...Wenger (18 seasons), Paul Tisdale (8 years at Exeter) and Mark Yates (5 years at Cheltenham Town)....the second longest tenured PL manager is Pardew with 4 seasons (well 3+ seasons) and Big Same 3 seasons (2+ Seasons) is next...and both of them are constantly on the hot seat.

Now i know that at the lower divisions longevity is tougher to come by, top managers tend to move up the food chain to the next level or to coaching staff's on bigger teams.  But, 3 managers with a minimum of 5 seasons in all of England is pretty jarring.  I think there is something like 12 managers in all of England who are with their team 3+ seasons. 

It seems like the only way to keep a manager for 5 seasons or more is for the team to perform exceptionally well and for the team to have money.  Even that isn't a guarentee, look at City...success under Mancini and they switch for Pelligrini. Chelsea a new manager each year. PSG a new manager each year. Real change frequently, Barca may change yet again, both Milan's seem to swap managers at the drop of a hat and they constantly seem to have managers on the hot seat.

It is beginning to seem like 5 years is just too much to expect out of a manager.  It really seems like 3 years would now be considered a ""long term"" appointment.",0,1395850176,null,0,false,0,cgcg1b5,t3_21eqmb,t1_cgcg1b5,t1_cgcek9w,null,1433077604,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

deaf people usually have acquired hearing loss, seek to integrate more with the hearing world, rely more on lip reading and hearing aids, and see their hearing loss in purely medical terms.

To be fair, our none of our top talent at the moment is actually saying this.

Eriksen has stated he loves playing here, Sandro has said the same, Walker and Townsend both just penned long term deals. Chadli turned down a loan deal in January to fight for his spot at Spurs. Vertonghen came out in an interview and said he will 100% be with Spurs next season and is focused on reaching CL with Spurs. Lloris is about the only one who hasn't made a declaration and even he said he hopes to get CL with Spurs. 

Of our current group of players its not like we have a squad full of players who are agitating for a move.  They for the most part all seem to talk about the task at hand.

Now Jan and Hugo could leave in the summer but neither are screaming to leave.

At the simplest level, it's a way to distinguish hard of hearing (but still requires hearing aids to hear, or becoming completely deaf after childhood), and completely Deaf where nothing will help. There's a culture divide also, in the deaf understanding the English language as a sound, and the Deaf understanding it as an image.

It's not a distinction that needs to be made outside of either communities, but most people have their own definition that divides the two.

Seems like all clubs just ignore this now.  

Part of our problem seems to be that we are shit at choosing managers. We continue to appoint managers who just aren't what we think they will be (Harry being the exception) and then move on to another manger to do the same. None of the managers that we have hired (and then promptly sacked) have gone on to do anything of note for anyone and i really don't know that us sticking with them would have resulted in anything special for us either.

I think unless we really get a great manager for our next appointment we will keep in the cycle.

That's somewhat more than the recently introduced old age benefits (Winter Fuel Allowance, £2bn, Free Bus Pass, £1bn, Free TV License, £0.5bn). Also, although a lot of EU money goes on agricultural subsidies, arguably the total budget is rather better spent than the UK budget, because far more of it goes into long term investment, into infrastructure, research etc (and the UK is the EU's top recipient of scientific research funding). And, of course, the contribution buys access to the single market, which unquestionably makes the economy more efficient - for instance, both exports and imports more seamless, and much easier for UK companies to grow, in a home market of 400m people, not 60m.

Parties have a whole range of policies and you can only vote for one. You could agree with one party on a very important issue but disagree on most of their other policies so you end up voting for another. Because of this you could have issues that the vast majority of the public agree on (e.g. offering an EU referendum) yet they never get that implemented. Also you can't even be guaranteed parties will even stand by their policy promises.

This represents a massive deficit of democracy in our system which could be remedied by a Swiss style referendum based system as Paludosa2 suggests where the public can force a vote on an issue that the parties aren't democratically representing them on. 

You can bet if we had that system there would be no privatisation of the NHS, less military interventionism, no selling off of the royal mail, probably nationalisation of the railways etc. All issues that all the main parties pretty much agree on yet because of our FPTP system we never get a say.

true,sgsollie,null,null,"This is probably a problem with whatever is reverse proxying the traffic to their webservers. Usually a load balancing appliance sitting infront of their servers.

When you have a login session with a website, to keep you logged in, the site will send whats called a cookie back to your web browser. This is a token (essentially a long encoded string) which your browser uses to authenticate with the website. This is how the webserver knows who is who and what information to send back to individual clients.

Popular websites can't have just one server hosting their pages. This is due to a number of reasons, but mainly due to load capacity and redundancy. This is where a load balancer comes in. 

A load balancer is a server, or appliance that sits infront of a sites webservers on the network and forwards traffic to them, often on a round-robin basis. It ensures that no one webserver gets overloaded with requests. - Things get complicated because they can be used to forward certain clients to certain servers (for example, if you tried to go to a site, lets say example.com from your phone. Usually, the load balancer will read your http headers, detect that you're a phone and forward you to m.example.com, hosted on a separate web server perhaps.)

So, if you're traffic is being forwarded to more than one server by a load balancer, how can you have an individual session? Well, what should happen is that the load balancer should be configured to detect your session cookie and forward you to just one webserver, namely, the webserver that issued the session cookie in the first place. This ensures you get the correct data back. 

What can happen, is that if it isn't configured to collect the right cookie, forwarding breaks, you either get no session, or worse, someone else's. - Another issue could be that the webserver you were getting forwarded to has crashed, so you're being forwarded to another server. 

This is all just speculation btw, they might not have that exact setup, but it will be something to do with session persistence most likely.

The fault lies with the government for producing such a screwed system that it does not work when the teachers do what they are paid to do. Instead of having to go above and beyond what they are contracted for.

Either way in order to get the government to listen, you will end up having to effect the kids education. You might as well do it in a way that shows how screwed the system is.

&gt;**“Most of our laws come from Brussels”**

&gt;Not true. The independent House of Commons library found that the real proportion is just 6.8% of laws and 14.1% of statutory instruments. And these figures include everything that even mentions the EU, “from passing reference to explicit implementation”, according to the researchers!

Somebody should tell EU commissioner Reding who says it's more like 70%, the German Federal Department of Justice estimated it at 80%.  The UK government is much more conservative in a report which includes the 6.8% figure:   

       Many EU regulations have a purely technical or 
       temporary effect. We estimate that around 50 per 
       cent of UK legislation with a significant economic 
       impact has its origins in EU legislation. OECD analysis 
       of regulation in Europe yields similar results. In 2002, 
       they estimated that 40 per cent of all new UK 
       regulations with a significant impact on business were 
       derived from Community legislation. Despite reports 
       that 80 per cent of German regulation emanates from 
       the EU, the German Government estimates that the 
       proportion is about 50 per cent.  

The UK passes legislation in the UK to meet EU commitments.  If this is included the amount of regulation as a share significantly increases.  It's also worth mentioning that whilst an estimated 15% of UK business is involved in someway with Europe, equating 8% of total GDP (again not going anywhere), EU regulation and regulation passed to observe EU commitment applies to 100% of UK business.  If you don't trade with them you still get the expense.

&gt;**“The EU forces its will on member countries”**

&gt;Not true. Firstly, we don’t decide anything at EU level unless all member countries have explicitly agreed by treaty to do so 

What's relevant is that when the UK does oppose something how effective is it.

At council level since 1996 the UK has opposed 55 measures with a failure rate of 100%.

Says it all, really.

&gt;**“EU membership costs us a fortune.”**

Contributions might be £50m a day.  The cost is much, much more.  Well in excess of a £100b per annum more.

http://www.ukipmeps.org/uploads/file/Cost_of_the_EU_25_5_11.pdf

Understand in conjunction with this the EU doesn't just receive funding from member states directly.  It takes a tariff on trade outside the EU.  So if somebody in the UK imports something from Africa, the tariffs, typically ~15% go to the EU coffers.

&gt;**“Our most important markets are China and the US, not the EU”**

&gt;Not true. The EU is the world’s largest single market. Fully half of Britain’s exports go there (amounting to some 3.5 million British jobs). Britain sells more to Holland alone than to the whole of China.

What difference if it's a singlemarket of 28 countries.  It's not going anywhere.  The relevance being that the growing markets, those holding or increasing their global share are increasingly outside the EU but the UK isn't allowed to form bilateral trade agreements.

The 3.5 million jobs line has not only been thoroughly rebuked, it has been rejected by its own author.  Tony Blair's government first used the line and the authors described it as 'pure Goebbels'.

The 50% of trade is much closer to 40% and completely ignores the Rotterdam-Antwerp Effect (not that it is going anywhere the UK has an EFTA trade agreement with all EFTA and EU members, signed outside the EU).  80% of UK trade is domestic, so we're arguing about 8% of trade not going anywhere but being able to increase the 12% share (and lowering international tariffs).

&gt;**“EU migrants are a drain on our resources”**

&gt;Not true. Firstly, most migrants in Britain are from outside the EU. Secondly, those that come here from our European neighbours pay far more in tax than they take in services and benefits. Most EU citizens living in the UK are young and contribute to our economy, having been educated and trained recently at the expense of their own country’s taxpayers. They have no right to jump the queue for benefits of any kind, and they can only come to Britain to work or if they’re self-sufficient.

Where most migrants come from is neither here nor there. Migrants outside the EU have controls on them.  We can open or close the door in increments.

Nobody is saying no immigration, but the ability to filter and vet  those that do come.  If NET they are a positive force, then great.  We can take the positive without the negative.  We can also do it at a pace so our infrastructure and services can plan for it, so they're better received.   

If they're filling a job which could have been filled domestically then by contributing, which they are, then they're still depriving somebody else of work and stacking the bleed on benefits even if its not themselves claiming.

&gt;**“The EU appoints judges to tell us what to do""**

&gt;Not true...it has no power to make laws, only to adjudicate on differences about interpreting the laws that have been agreed by member countries.

Outright not true for the UK.  ECJ judges have no knowledge of UK Common Law and post Lisbon have been passing judgment based on ECHR precedent supposedly outside the EU.

It has been noted by more than one member state that the ECJ has become a law unto itself.

&gt;**“No-one under 55 has ever had a say on belonging to the EU”**

&gt;Not true. If the only way to have a say on an issue is to have a national referendum on it, then none of us have had a say on anything much! We’ve never had national referendums on joining NATO, WTO, the UN or any international structure, nor on any domestic policy issue.

But when we vote for a party/candidate at a General Election we are voting across multiple policies.  If people specifically had an issue with NATO, and if a vast majority wanted one, then of course we should put it to a referendum and thrash out the concerns.  

It's a particularly weaselly way to go about it to say that you've had a say when all 3 mainstream parties in the general election are in favour of staying in.  This is an argument coming from the Labour MEP that the people shouldn't be heard and/or treated with contempt.

&gt;**“Switzerland and Norway survive perfectly well outside the EU”**

&gt;Be careful what you wish for!

Switzerland and Norway having lived it are in no doubt that they're better off - they could join in a moment but they haven't.  Also there's a 190 countries in the world.  Plenty of modern, developed countries survive outside the EU, of all sizes.  Norway does get a veto (we don't), and they do get a say, but then why would we want to go down a Norwegian tailored deal?

This idea that Switzerland and Norway are special cases and the UK has nothing going for it is just defeatist and pessimistic for the sake of being defeatist and pessimistic.  We have many things going for us which most countries would give their hind teeth; cultural-export giants, bespoke engineers, and a world capital of finance just for starters.",1,1395853390,null,0,1395854475,0,cgchmtp,t3_21ejs6,t1_cgchmtp,t3_21ejs6,null,1433078356,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,pairyhenis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire (Soton and a bit of Wiltshire),"&gt;BMI has known issues with height as well as body composition. A person 6ft 2in will get a massively over reported BMI while a person who is 5ft 4in will get an under reported BMI.

I contest that the values are ""massively"" over or under reported.   BMI doesn't work well in children due to the height scaling issue but it's broadly effective in adults.

As I said, it's in use because it is both a quick and easy measure, and a well-validated risk factor.  If another risk factor (such as waist circumference, waist:height ratio) outperformed BMI and was supported by literature guiding the thresholds of risk, it would see use.  Indeed, waist circumference is beginning to see clinical use; it's not perfect though, BMI outperforms it dramatically in predicting blood pressure.  BMI works very well as an initial screen, not as a de facto diagnostic tool (and any clinical staff using it as such without considering it's shortcomings haven't been paying attention).

Winning the title is out of our hands - as Rodgers has pointed out several times, we could win every single game remaining and still not win the title. Would that diminish this teams achievement so far? Absolutely not. It's been a absolutely stupendous season, no superlatives quite do it justice. Fuck titles - after how long - when you say Liverpool, you think Style and Swagger. How long have we been without that identity and confidence? Who cares if we win ""it"". We already won it!! 

For me the next 8 games are about slowing down, savoring and appreciating smaller moments, individual progress etc.

After we cut away from the EPL this summer - the boys go off to their respective national teams, and will hopefully grow and mature even further. Added to that the presumable spending war chest Brendan will be given and it all points to an extremely successful 2014/15 season.

1: His pure historicals are good (IMO) such as The Aztecs, Reign of Terror and the Romans. The First Three serials are also good (including the first Dalek serial. Time meddler I also enjoy. Also the Tenth Planet is good

2: If you don't mind reconstructions Power of the Daleks, Macra Terror, and Evil of the Daleks are Good but if you do the following are also good, Mind Robber, Invasion, War Games, Tomb of the Cybermen, Enemy of the World

3: His entire first series is amazing (IMO) so watch all of that and then maybe Green Death, The Three Doctors, The Seas Devils, Carnival of Monsters and The Time Warrior

4: First series is mostly great especially Arc in Space and Genesis of the Daleks( easily one of the best stories of Doctor Who ever). Then there are Terror of the Zygons, Planet of Evil, Brain of Morbius, Horror of Fang Rock, Terror of Weng-Chiang (unfortunately a bit racist but a good story nonetheless), Sun Makers, Key to Time (Classic Who's first long story arc), City of Death, Logopolis. 

5:Kinda, Snakedance, Black Orchid, Earthshock, Cave of Androzani are all good

6:Vengance on Varos and the Trial of a Time Lord (second long story arc Classic who did)

7:Happiness Patrol, Remembrance of the Daleks, Greatest show in the Galaxy an his entire last season are all good

8: Movie unsurprisingly. This is not a great story but Paul McGann is excellent in it

I think this also has most of the important moments in it i.e. first appearance of Davros, the Daleks and the Cybermen etc.. Ii will add almost everything by Robert Holmes is fantastic.

Of course, even when the invasions had been made aware of, the precise details may not have been known to everyone.

If I had to speculate; Durkin got into a protracted arguement with the manager which culminated in him dumping the laptop, saying something along the lines of ""well, I don't want it..."" and leaving the store. Doubtless somebody working there realised that they hadn't properly processed the return (and cancelled the credit agreement) but were likely told it would be dealt with later.

Onus was put back on Durkin to return to the store and formally complete the return, which he never bothered to do (why would he?). 

By all accounts this whole saga happened during the busy Christmas period so it's quite possible that any noble intent by anyone working at the store to sort this out was lost amongst the chaos of the season (they employ lots of temps during ""peak"").

I do recall similar situations though, having to cancel credit agreement after customers had stormed off.

I'd like to believe that this was an honest fuck-up by the store, but there's a good chance that somebody intended for this *stroppy customer* to have a bad time.

true,fedorahtheexplora,lfc99,,"Absolutely true. While I'm definitely not the first to say this, I think A LOT of credit needs to be given to Rodgers. The amount of confidence he's instilled in his players to believe in themselves, not to even mention the huge improvements he's helped develop in guys like Hendo, Sterling, Flanno, Sturridge, etc .... has been remarkable. He's done in 2 years what Wenger hasn't been able to really do in 5-8, and that's improve the squad from within and have them be serious contenders while playing a very attacking, aesthetically pleasing style of play, and thats not even mentioning the tactical nous he's demonstrated throughout the year. Easily the manager of the year IMO. ",0,1395859456,null,0,false,0,cgcknm9,t3_21ep6o,t1_cgcknm9,t1_cgckg2h,null,1433079846,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

Premier League  
26 March 2000  
  
Paolo Di Canio stole the show when Wimbledon visited the Boleyn Ground on this date in 2000, scoring the Goal of the Season with a volley that no West Ham United supporter will ever forget.  
  
The Hammers went into this Boleyn Ground London derby with Wimbledon in decent form, having claimed positive results in three of their previous four fixtures. The Dons' stay in the top flight was coming to an end and the Hammers didn't let up against the south Londoners.  

It took Di Canio just eight minutes to open the scoring with his now world-famous first-time right-foot volley from Trevor Sinclair's cross that angled past a helpless Neil Sullivan in the Wimbledon goal.  

West Ham held their advantage until the break and a second goal from Frederic Kanoute on 59 minutes looked to have taken the game away from Wimbledon, although Michael Hughes ensured a nervy finish by pulling one back 14 minutes from the end.  
  
West Ham were not to be denied though, with the three point haul lifting them up into eighth place in the table.  
  
They were to end the campaign a position lower in ninth, with 55 points from 38 games.  
  
 Wimbledon, meanwhile, finished 18th, suffering relegation by a three-point margin from Bradford City.",0,1395859692,null,0,false,0,cgckrxq,t3_21fpth,t1_cgckrxq,t3_21fpth,null,1433079903,1,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,1
