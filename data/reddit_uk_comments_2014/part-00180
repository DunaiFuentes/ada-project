He has lifted a city weekend after weekend. Fans can appreciate that, and can cheer for that.

Luis Suarez has a chequered past in football, without a doubt.

At the very least it was incredibly naive to think that Suarez had totally changed after the Ivanovic incident. He professed a desire to change and to redeem himself, but he's still the same person he was when he bit him. If you welcomed him back and grabbed onto his brilliance as your own as part of the club, and you're now hanging him out to dry, then you're a hypocrite. You can't have it both ways, not with him or any player. 

Everyone can criticise him, I'm not saying that they can't or they shouldn't, but there will be enough people lining up outside the walls of Anfield and Melwood to do that without us grabbing pitchforks as well.

The difference between the Sainsbury's Local and the Morrisons is that Morrisons is a proper supermarket and closes at sensible times, like somewhere between 6 and 8pm. It's also been there time immemorial.

The Sainsbury's on the other hand has only been there for around 3-4 years, ever since Taj closed down. You'll notice that the Sainsbury's Local up by the clock tower also does not sell alcohol for the same reason.

Basically there's already enough places to buy alcohol, so the city doesn't need more. Just go to Morrisons.

Finally, what difference does it make what jersey the guy is wearing when he BITES someone. Does it reflect more highly on his character that he bit someone when he wasn't playing for his club? Does that make it more excusable? I would say that it hurts Liverpool's brand even more because he did on the world stage in front of a bigger audience then if he had been playing for his club.

Honestly I feel like people relatively new to soccer just dismiss Suarez as being this rare mad man who's behavior is something new to the sport. I think a lot of these people don't realize how aggressive Zidane was in the midst of him playing brilliantly, the dude got sent off quite a number of times. Hell there are tons of players out there who had thug moments.

Suarez is gonna obviously face a ban for this but I think people are getting a bit too foamy at the mouth spouting all this bullshit how ""he should be expelled from the sport for life"", ""sent to prison"", ""1 billion game ban"", etc.  We'll have to wait and see.

The above link gives a brief demonstration of about how far we've come with it. The guy in the video is obviously more of a Star Wars fan, but I hope you won't begrudge me lack of source material.

Any whoozle....

The Sonic Screwdriver, from what I can gather from the series, is simply a tool. And the technology is not Time Lord or Doctor dependent, either. If you recall ""Partners in Crime"", Miss Foster used a similar piece of sonic technology. Now, the Doctor's reaction to her use of it seems to suggest that the technology is somewhat rare, or perhaps only people skilled in the use of Sonic Technology are allowed to use it.

Also consider the ""Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead"" arc where we first meet Professor River Song, who has a screwdriver given to her by The Doctor. However, hers is upgraded- suggesting that screwdrivers are little more than a very handy, advanced piece of hardware.

Essentially, the Sonic Screwdriver is very scientifically plausible (though we're nowhere near it's capabilities now) and, from what I can gather, fairly widely used in the Universe, if only by those who know how to use it/know how to come by one.

1) because Suarez's actions occur when there is 0 physical or verbal threat to his person (i.e. none of Ciellini, Ivanovic, nor Bakkal were actively provoking Suarez as far as I can tell, he literally just appears to have randomly decided to bite them).  Zidane was (supposedly) being taunted about his heritage, the guy in the crowd was taunting Cantona, etc.  It doesn't make their actions correct or excusable, but at least they were a reaction to something whereas why Suarez bit the three is a complete unknown that's he's never bothered to explain. 

2) It's just freaking weird.  Who randomly decides to bite someone?  In a game, someone pisses me off for fouling me or talking constantly, then they're going to get tackled.

I would guess that simply serving the claim form would be enough to show them you mean business. You need to serve it on them, which either you or the court can do.

Before you get to that stage, you should send them a letter headed ""letter before claim"" stating what the law says, what you want, and what you'll do if they don't comply (ie issue proceedings against them). I had a similar situation and I told the landlord that if he repaid the deposit in full with no deductions I wouldn't claim any further cash from him. He was falling over himself to pay up. Remember that if you do this you can't change your mind later and claim additional money back as well.

I found several solicitors that take these claims under a CFA (no win no fee) with a quick google. I don't know anything about them, but you should check the terms of the CFA very carefully because it can eat into your award.

* The Master expended all of his regenerations back in Classic DW. At the end of his thirteenth and final body's life, he discovered a method of taking over other life forms' bodies. He used that technique to take over the body of the Keeper of Traken, the father of the fifth Doctor's companion Nyssa. It's presumably that body that gets executed on Skaro. At some point prior to the movie he learned to preserve his essence in that liquid snake like thing. Through that form, he took over a human body, which partially mutated from the process. Evidently the Time Lords figured out a way to retrieve/resurrect him from the Eye of Harmony, as they used him during the Time War.
* I don't remember any part about himself crossing his own timeline in that movie.
* Yeah, it was a very '90s show, and not in a good way.",0,1403673172,null,0,1403673772,0,ciggirb,t3_2914ld,t1_ciggirb,t3_2914ld,null,1434392984,21,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,21

true,ShittyTeam,logo,,"Disclaimer: Personally I think Yaya is happy and a lot of the Prima Donna nature we here about is a mix of his agent wanting a fat signing bonus every year and I wouldn't be entirely surprised if he sees Yaya as his last chances on a 'cash cow' and the media wanting a 'good story'. Think of the call his agent did in to Sky Sports after the birthday scandal compared to any Yaya post-match interviews were he often refers to Manchester City as *his*, Kompany's and Zabaleta's project, him being the 'household' name of the trio before he came to City. tl;dr I don't believe any stories about Yaya till I literally see the words coming out of his mouth in an interview, there have been multiple times he has been misquoted or complete fabrications.

However I have concerns about the lack of youth in the centre of the park, Fernandinho is phenomenal at covering for Yaya currently defensively, but he is 29 this season and his exceptional workrate can't last forever. As I see it we have two options, we can keep replacing our CM with other players in their prime, see Barry with Fernandinho. Or we can try to pry one of the younger players that are ready to compete for a starting spot in the next year or two, this runs a much higher risk and hard to tempt as these players are looking for guaranteed minutes. If we go with the latter, I think it would be hard to convince Pogba, but my suggestion of Ross Barkley could be equally difficult to acquire.

In short, I think we should wait a year, give Rodwell another shot and if things don't work out, cut our losses with him and do everything in our power to sign a replacement for Yaya.

As for Yaya, I hope he stays at the club in potentially work as a coach as Vieira did, but that will be his decision (and hopefully not his agents.)",0,1403673925,null,0,false,0,ciggrid,t3_29157k,t1_ciggrid,t3_29157k,null,1434393097,6,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,6

true,orange_pear,null,null,"Just for information, the Housing Act has been amended fairly recently. It makes clear that tenants aren't automatically entitled to 3x their deposit. I think it would really depend on the conduct of the letting agent how much was awarded - if it was really just a mistake by the landlord and the tenant got their money back, a judge won't be keen to award the tenant 3x the deposit when no real harm has taken place. On the other hand, if they've deliberately omitted to register the deposit and act in a shady manner when the tenant tries to get it back, the judge might be minded to punish them. 




214  Proceedings relating to tenancy deposits

(1)     Where a tenancy deposit has been paid in connection with a shorthold tenancy, the tenant or any relevant person (as defined by section 213(10)) may make an application to a county court [the county court] on the grounds—

[(a)     that section 213(3) or (6) has not been complied with in relation to the deposit, or]

(b)     that he has been notified by the landlord that a particular authorised scheme applies to the deposit but has been unable to obtain confirmation from the scheme administrator that the deposit is being held in accordance with the scheme.

[(1A)     Subsection (1) also applies in a case where the tenancy has ended, and in such a case the reference in subsection (1) to the tenant is to a person who was a tenant under the tenancy.]

(2)     Subsections (3) and (4) apply [in the case of an application under subsection (1) if the tenancy has not ended and] the court—

[(a)     is satisfied that section 213(3) or (6) has not been complied with in relation to the deposit, or]

(b)     is not satisfied that the deposit is being held in accordance with an authorised scheme,

as the case may be.

[(2A)     Subsections (3A) and (4) apply in the case of an application under subsection (1) if the tenancy has ended (whether before or after the making of the application) and the court—

(a)     is satisfied that section 213(3) or (6) has not been complied with in relation to the deposit, or

(b)     is not satisfied that the deposit is being held in accordance with an authorised scheme,

as the case may be.]

(3)     The court must, as it thinks fit, either—

(a)     order the person who appears to the court to be holding the deposit to repay it to the applicant, or

(b)     order that person to pay the deposit into the designated account held by the scheme administrator under an authorised custodial scheme,

within the period of 14 days beginning with the date of the making of the order.

[(3A)     The court may order the person who appears to the court to be holding the deposit to repay all or part of it to the applicant within the period of 14 days beginning with the date of the making of the order.]

(4)     The court must . . . order the landlord to pay to the applicant a sum of money [not less than the amount of the deposit and not more than] three times the amount of the deposit within the period of 14 days beginning with the date of the making of the order.

(5)     Where any deposit given in connection with a shorthold tenancy could not be lawfully required as a result of section 213(7), the property in question is recoverable from the person holding it by the person by whom it was given as a deposit.

(6)     In subsection (5) “deposit” has the meaning given by section 213(8).",0,1403673949,null,0,false,0,ciggrsh,t3_28zpm8,t1_ciggrsh,t1_cig3gt6,null,1434393103,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Willian is like Oscar except can't shoot consistently. He's great at recovering the ball and great at moving the ball forward by himself. His decision-making and shooting let him down consistently and I'd like to see someone else by given the chance to do more with that role.

&gt;""At the end of the season, I wanted to stay for four or five days with my brother before I flew to prepare for the World Cup with Ivory Coast, except that City did not want to give me a few days.

&gt;""I went to celebrate the title championship in Abu Dhabi while my brother was in his sickbed. By fortune, Kolo was at his bedside. After that I blame myself for not insisting and for not leading them to respect me.

&gt;""However, club officials knew that I had been suffering for a few months seeing the health of my brother decline. This is the reason I had several injuries at the end of the season, because my head had taken control of my body. These last four months have probably been the hardest in my life.

&gt; ""For sure, doctors had left me with very little hope when I had left for the World Cup. During those days, he could not even respond to my calls, he was so tired.

&gt; ""I also felt that brother Ismael and my sister Aicha, who had stayed with him in Manchester, were not telling me everything the last few days. Despite that, in these cases we always try and hold on to a miracle.

&gt;""The news came as a huge shock because I was very close to him. We spent two years apart but we were very close. As kids we always stuck together and we played in the famous local tournaments that were never-ending.

&gt;""I wonder how I¹ll cope without him. I know that I will no longer be able to hear him, sense him, see him, this feels awful, especially when you¹re thousands of kilometres away.

If there's even a kernel of truth in the articles about him not being allowed leave to see Ibrahim, it could have been as a result of that, trying to kick up a fuss but not being able to reveal the real reasons.

Just after the birthday card spat, someone made the very good point that if Yaya goes, where will he go to? He's a cracking player at the top of his game, but he's 31, and he can't have much left in his football career. Other clubs at City's level will know this, and might not be keen to spend his asking price on a player that might not be worth it in 2 seasons.",0,1403678384,null,0,false,0,cigi12s,t3_29157k,t1_cigi12s,t3_29157k,null,1434393759,17,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,17

&gt;A __junk__ is an ancient [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) [sailing vessel/ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing_ship) design still in use today. Junks were developed during the Song Dynasty (960-1279)  and were used as seagoing vessels as early as the 2nd century CE. They evolved in the later dynasties, and were used throughout [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia) for extensive ocean voyages. They were found, and in lesser numbers are still found, throughout [South-East Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South-East_Asia) and [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India), but primarily in [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China), perhaps most famously in [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong). Found more broadly today is a growing number of modern recreational junk-rigged sailboats.

true,nivlark,,County,"This year I've lived on campus in a townhouse and my rent has been £108 a week. That's reasonable for on campus, if you start looking for ensuite then the price goes up (£120-30). My place has one bathroom between two and a (big) kitchen between twelve. Most other flats are 6-8 people sharing a kitchen and a couple of bathrooms. 

I'm sharing a flat in town with three others next year and our rent is £92 a week each. Even factoring in the cost of the bus pass it works out as cheaper than this year. Most properties are just rented houses so they have three to four people sharing a bathroom and kitchen. I think you'd find it quite hard to find an individual studio apartment in town and they might be quite pricy. There are actually some on campus which cost about £150 a week.

My personal reccomendation would be to go for on campus to be honest. It might be slightly more expensive, but the campus experience is worthwhile IMO. If you're on campus your accommodation will have some reps assigned for fresher's week who will help you with settling in and show you around. And as you say, it's a lot easier to meet people living on campus than on your own in town.

There are two shops on campus which are fine for occasional stuff but to do a big shop it's cheaper in town. Sainsbury's supermarket puts on free bus services between the uni and the store in the city centre every Wednesday so that's a good time to do a shop. You can also do your shopping online and get it delivered, although there's a minimum spend so it's best to club together with others.

Why? Well, the reality is, people don't seem to understand quite how beholden to the rest of the UK we are. We are not self-sustainable, and as a population live largely on handouts meted out by the British Government. Be it from the majority of public sector jobs that make up the market, to the vast investment the UK has to make to almost all major companies that hire privately. Now include the health service, benefits, police and other public services (car tax/roads maintenance etc.)

Without the UK's support, Northern Ireland would go straight back to the stone age. If we joined the South, it would absolutely cripple their economy and destroy them too, setting the entire (new) country back generations.

There is no chance in hell any of that is going to change any time soon, so for that reason alone I wouldn't vote yes.

Most of the time players go into tackles and accidentally brake anothers legs. Sometimes they know they arrive late and still follow through but their intent is not break an opponent. This is why I believe that he should not only get a ban from international football , he should also not be allowed on the pitch until he gets some psychological help. Honestly.

I remember what sub teachers are like when they are called in last minute.  But that's not the case here.

When a teacher needs time off, and there has been advanced notice (like maternity) a sub will be brought in who is either from the same department, or teachers the same subject and is up to speed regarding the curriculum. There is every chance they would be a better teacher than the one they are replacing.

Luis Suarez is a money maker. He's a 'franchise' player. Has his previous indiscretions cost us sponsorship opportunities? No. We've got more fucking sponsors than we've ever had. We've got an official donut provider and an official airline that's based in Indofuckingnesia. We are a global club and Suarez only adds to our global brand.

On the field, his contribution speaks for itself. He missed six games and still scored 31 goals. We rely on him less now and with good business in the summer, we'll rely on him even less. That said, he can be the difference between winning the Premier League and not winning the Premier League. However, it does mean that even if he does get a club suspension, it won't be as terrible as you're making it out to be.  He is one of the best three players in the world. We cannot replace him. We can sell him and buy a bunch of good players but we still wouldn't have a superstar.  

Suarez being at Liverpool is a net gain. There is no valid argument to the contrary. I don't care what other fans think of Liverpool FC.

There is an unless section
&gt;(a)that he has reasonable grounds for making the demand; and .
(b)that the use of the menaces is a proper means of reinforcing the demand.

I am by no means an expert, but like talking out my arse so will give my judgement on the case - the Landlord is trying to gain a profit by getting the NDA signed (preventing bad reviews and attempting to prevent legal action etc), and is unwarranted in doing this as what he did was illegal anyway.

- nobody is saying teachers &amp; children are comparable - but what does that even mean?
- yes teachers are important to preserving the quality of a childs education, thats why they are not allowed time off unless for extremely good reason (like job interviews, funerals). 
- any organisation that has to provide important service at set times and places expects its staff to be there, and by extension leadership needs to be there as oart of that team. this basic principle is visible in dozens of industries.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;No. It has more to do with the growth of Asian economies,

And that growth is slowing year on year in all of these economies. How does a slowing growth rate equate to a strong economy in your mind?   

&gt;You're downplaying Asia's growth without evidence. Africa and Asia are going to be the fastest growing and largest economies by 2050.

As I've said already, Chinas growth rate is slowing, which is causing problems for the government there as they expected it to continue to rise, and China is the only country who's economy is predicted to grow larger than the USA's by 2050. 
The average growth rate across Africa is about 4%, not bad, but not much compared with what other similar economies have been able to manage in recent years. Africa has many problems that it needs to overcome if it is going to achieve any real development, the main problems being a lack of infrastructure, and political corruption, neither of which there are any signs of improvement. 

Having the largest economy doesn't necessarily mean you have a good economy. Brazil has the 7th largest economy in the world, yet their growth rate has fallen below 1%. The BRICs have the potential to grow into dominant economies, but that's all it is, potential.

Even if everything goes perfectly for them, and they achieve everything they have the potential to achieve, according the Goldman Sachs report, which is where you get your 2050 figure from, the UK economy would still be the 9th largest in the world, do you consider that insignificant? Also, according to the same report, our GDP per capita will actually improve to 3rd in the world. 

&gt;Being more independent of the EU gives us more opportunity to grow, not less.
&gt;Dead wrong.

And your evidence for this is a one sided article from the guardian?

The truth is there is growing hatred within Europe for the political union side of the arrangement. People want good beneficial trade relations within Europe, as well as some legislative agreements, but they want sovereign over their own countries. Europe could be like this, and no-one would have a problem, but politicians are ignoring what the people of Europe are saying, in favour of their own personal vision of what they think Europe should be. By 2050, if the rise of Euroscepticism continues, across the whole of Europe, not just the UK, the EU might not even exist any more. If it does, it will have far less political integration.   

With that in mind, outside of the EU we have the opportunity to do our own deals, and the EU is not going to cut itself off from the 6th largest economy in the world, as some people seem to think it will. 

&gt;The Pound is not the reason for the UK's growth.

I didn't say it was, I said that by staying out of the Euro we avoided its near collapse, which did economic damage to all the countries who were a part of it. If we had been a part of the Euro, our economy would have suffered even more than it did, more companies would have gone out of business, more people would have been unemployed. This would mean that there would be less and slower growth after things started to get better, and we would be in a worse position, with less growth today.

Option 1 - is to take your landlord to small claims court by filling out a N1 county court claim form and taking it to the court in person or using Money Claim Online. Before you submit anything to the court you should send your former LL a Letter before Action (LBA), stating that if the withheld amount is not returned in 14 days you will submit a claim to the county court. For added impact print off and fill in the N1 form, and send it along with your LBA. The cost of submitting a N1 claim is dependant on the amount being claimed. Get some advice on whether threatening to go to the evening post will reflect badly in court, if it won't then the letter before action should spur them into action.

Option 2 - is to take your landlord to court for non-tds compliance (i.e. x3 compensation). This carry’s certain risks (as outlined in various posts above) and it isn’t 100% certain that you will win for various reasons (i.e. you are no longer the tenant), however there is also the chance you will win. If you want to move forward with this option then you will need to print off and fill in the N208 Part 8 claim form, you cannot use MoneyClaim Online for non-tds compliance claims as this will issue a standard N1 form and not a N208 Part 8. I would still suggest a LBA with accompanying form to show you mean business. Wording can be suggested if you want to go with this. It will cost you a set fee of £150 to submit this claim.

For the hundredth time...

Spurs didn't fail because of selling Bale. In fact their total points were practically identical. I think they had three less than they had with Bale, and in the first half of the season they actually had a point *more.*

They ""failed"" because 

- They played a high line with two slow defenders.
- Soldado was incapable of playing up front alone.
- The players they bought in were mostly average.
- AVB isn't a very good manager.

Selling Bale barely had any impact at all in regards to their league standing.

Why don't people understand this? It's one of the biggest misconceptions of last year.

With Bale: 72

Without Bale: 69

&gt;You know the ""huge amounts of time off"" teachers get is unpaid right?

Not sure who you're quoting there? I don't really care, it's just a pointless technicality. Full time teachers get paid a salary monthly. They sign a contract for a certain pay divided over the year. The end result is no different to how other workers get paid and have holiday, but teachers get more time off. Argue all you like. They might spend some days planning and marking, but they still get more time off than others.

&gt;Yet it isn't actually time off, its just time off teaching - when do you think the planning and a lot of marking gets done?

They also sometimes make a mess of personal details. A few weeks ago, I got a call from what I presume was a recruiter summoning me to an interview all the way in Basildon, Essex. During said call, they didn't refer to me by my actual name, never disclosed their name, never disclosed the company's name, never disclosed what position I supposedly but did not apply for, called from a private number and promised they'd email me with details which they never did.

It's at the point where I wish said job sites would just ban recruiters entirely and demand that companies post job listings themselves. Perhaps it would increase the standard of jobs posted exponentially.

Then there are a few addresses from Reed which have spammed my email inbox with so much crap which I am unqualified for or entirely uninterested in purely because I applied for a job advertised by them once.

true,LotsOfButtons,null,null,"&gt; In response to the first question. If getting you to quit smoking is as simple as some man in a suit telling you you have to quit smoking, why hasn't that worked already? Has no-one told you to quit smoking? Should I do that now?

Even if cigarettes were illegal you'd still be able to obtain them, the temptation would still be there for you only it'd be even more harmful than it is now.


while I admire your valiant attempts to straw man me I feel inclined to go into further detail to explain myself. At the moment if I were to quit and had a craving for a cigarette it would be very very easy to get hold of one, be it going to the local shops, asking a friend or even asking a stranger in the street, if however they were illegal it could take me hours if not days to get hold of one and by then (even though I'd probably not bother) the craving would be well gone. So yes they would still be available but not so readily available that they are there to fill an immediate craving.

&gt; There's also a very important comparison with the Volstead act that you've missed. During prohibition in the US there were numerous exceptions for medical, industrial and religious uses of alcohol - in addition to 'wine bricks' and similar legal fictions. These 'legal' alcohols - which were not for imbiding recreationally - still found their way in the hands of recreational drinkers.
	
Again I think this comparison is weak at best, apart for the exception for medical marijuana I can’t think of any others that could really hold merit, and in terms of ‘make your own alcohol’  alcohol is far easier to produce than tobacco as you can make it with various things available to the public whereas tobacco takes at least 80 days to grow and a single plant will only get you 50 cigarettes worth.


In conclusion I am not saying that this ban will eradicate smoking, what it will do is significantly reduce both the amount of smokers and the amount those who chose to continue smoking smoke.",0,1403693362,null,0,false,0,cigkuqf,t3_28uw3d,t1_cigkuqf,t1_cig303c,null,1434395090,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;Six-figure subsidies meant to help struggling farmers are being paid out to some of Britain's richest landowners, BBC Panorama has found.
Recipients of the EU subsidy include the Queen and the Duke of Westminster.

&gt;....

&gt;The data from England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland shows that 889 landowners received more than £250,000. **Of those, 133 were given more than £500,000 and 47 of those were given more than £1m in subsidy.**

http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/revealed-how-we-pay-our-richest-landowners-millions-subsidies

&gt;A freedom of information request by the NS to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs found that claimants last year included the Duke of Westminster (net worth: £7.4bn), who was paid £748,716 for his ownership of Grosvenor Farms, the Duke of Buccleuch (£180m), who received £260,273, the Duke of Devonshire (£700m), who received £251,729, and the Duke of Atholl, who was paid £231,188 for his 145,000 acre Blair Castle Estate.

 
&gt;It was also a lucrative year for the Windsor family. The Queen received £415,817 for The Royal Farms and £314,811 for the Duchy of Lancaster, while Prince Charles was paid £127,868 for the Duchy of Cornwall.

We left the bus station, and he moved forward a row. Okay, whatevs. And then another row. And another. Now he's one row behind me, on the other side of the...no wait, he's now swapped sides of the bus, and is sat directly behind me. I carry on reading Metro, hoping he won't disturb me. No such luck. Tries to start a full on conversation, asks where I'm going, what I'm doing, how old I am, etc etc. I politely but briefly answer his questions, and continue reading.

Yes, obviously, because I see a distinction between racism, racist language, and abusive language

We already have laws about obscenity, abuse and aggression, into which the language use as I've indicated it would fall. The reason we have racism laws in addition are to prevent someone discriminating against someone solely on the grounds of their race. Using a term deemed racist in this context in my view isn't indicative that the user is racist. 

Not really very difficult distinction to make

I made the woman (a rather prim and proper old lady) read it to me down the phone.  It said something like ""This stupid system is completely bolloxed"". 

She only had to say ""This stupid system..."" and I knew what the error message was word-for-word, remembered when I had written it, making a mental note (which apparently I later misplaced) to change it to a more customer-friendly message at some point.

Of course, she didn't stop after the first three words, but read the whole thing, carefully enunciating each word while I cringed.

In another case, now being much older and wiser, I had to explain to fellow developers why ""Colin McCunt"" being the property agent for ""Hairy Cock Retail Park"" was a bad idea, regardless of the fact that it was a test database that customers ""never saw"".  

It turns out that the marketing team would routinely including a screen shot of our fancy web management system in brochures and promotional material they were developing.  For reasons known only to themselves, they used the internal test system for the screen shots which was connected to the test database...

Anyway, the moral of the story is to never type anything into a computer that you wouldn't want a customer to see.  Internal error messages for things that can ""never happen"" end up being displayed to users.  Test messages that will ""never be sent"" get sent accidentally.  Sooner or later your hairy cock and bollox will be exposed for all to see and you will feel rather silly.

At the end of the day I honestly think that as far as pain goes biting is one of the least painful things that a footballer can do when lashing out, I mean sure it will sting for around 10 seconds but then it's done, (unless you take a chunk out of his arm which he clearly didn't).An elbow to the face is going to hurt more, studs up flying at someones knee is going to hurt more (Marchisio), and stamping on peoples feet / hands is going to hurt a lot more. At the end of the day I'm not defending him, and it is bad but It's nowhere near as bad as people are making it out to be, and imo it isn't the worst thing that's even happened this world cup. The only difference is he cant play innocent and act like it was an accident as you can with most other things.

Personally I think he deserves a ban, I don't think you can argue that. But I really don't think he should be banned form the Premiership, that would be punishing Liverpool just as much as suarez, and as the incident happened at international level i would really like to think the ban would stay at international level.

The way I see it if he isn't banned from club football this scenario was perfect, He will be banned from the rest of the world cup so he wont get injured, he just bit someone so no1 will want to buy him, and he plays less games so he will be better rested.. And i couldn't really care less about ""liverpools name been dragged through the mud"" If you're a liverpool fan you will love this club no matter what, and if you're not a liverpool fan you're gonna hate us anyway.

Section 22. [**Personal life**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Fowler#Personal_life) of article  [**Robbie Fowler**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie%20Fowler): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;Fowler married wife Kerrie on 9 June 2001 in the town of [Duns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duns) in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland). Together they have three daughters named Madison, Jaya, and Mackenzie,  and one son, Jacob.

&gt;Fowler is a supporter of Liverpool F.C. and regularly attends matches at Anfield. He does media work for [Abu Dhabi Sports Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi_Sports_Channel), [Sky Sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports) and [ITV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network\)).

&gt;In association with long term friend [Steve McManaman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McManaman), Fowler has invested in several racehorses through a chattily named company *The Macca and Growler Partnership*, most notably 2003 Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Celebration Chase runner-up Seebald.  In 2005, Fowler was listed as one of the 1,000 wealthiest Britons by the *[Sunday Times Rich List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Times_Rich_List)*, with the paper estimating he has a property portfolio of more than 80, while his *Robbie Fowler Sports Promotions* company has been reported to have net assets of £1.58 million.  Other business interests including a large property portfolio have resulted in Fowler's net wealth totaling £28 million.  This gave rise to the affectionate Manchester City Football Club chant, *We all live in a Robbie Fowler house*, sung to the tune of [Yellow Submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Submarine_(song\)).

A lot of people who aren't nationalists, not just on this board but throughout the province, are also deeply fed up with Loyalist/Unionist behaviour.

They're selfish, ignorant and aggressive - so it's unsurprising that people are annoyed and have started behaving that way back to them. It's all they deserve, given their attitude.

If they want sustainable peace and progress for Northern Ireland, they really need to buck their ideas up. They need to let go of the flags altogether - that means no more flags on lampposts. They need to sort their attitude out towards gays and operate a zero tolerance approach to racism. They need to let go of contentious marches, stop playing antagonistic songs at flashpoints and churches. They need to stop insulting everyone with their ridiculous accusations of victimhood, and take a more serious approach to their alleged culture - making it more inclusive and dropping the sectarian element (which will be difficult, given that their culture is for all intents and purposes built on hatred.)

&gt; *The government considers that almost all Facebook and other social media communications and Google searches will always fall within the ""external"" category, even when such communications are between two people in the UK*

She goes on,

&gt; ""at will and without authorisation. This is nonsense.""

Indeed: the British Government has [self-signed authorization to allow the intercepts](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/21/legal-loopholes-gchq-spy-world). It's quite hard to fall foul of one's own rules if one writes, implements and oversees them oneself...

&gt;* In a 32-page opinion, the leading public law barrister Jemima Stratford QC raises a series of concerns about the legality and proportionality of GCHQ's work, and the lack of safeguards for protecting privacy.
&gt;* It makes clear the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (Ripa), the British law used to sanction much of GCHQ's activity, has been left behind by advances in technology. The advice warns:
&gt;* Ripa does not allow mass interception of contents of communications between two people in the UK, even if messages are routed via a transatlantic cable.
&gt;* The interception of bulk metadata – such as phone numbers and email addresses – is a ""disproportionate interference"" with article 8 of the ECHR.
&gt;* The current framework for the retention, use and destruction of metadata is inadequate and likely to be unlawful.
&gt;* If the government knows it is transferring data that may be used for drone strikes against non-combatants in countries such as Yemen and Pakistan, that is probably unlawful.

It is reasonable to expect that someone might tackle with malice or even throw an elbow as the game has rules to deal with that sort of conduct. Biting may be bizarre enough to fall outside the umbrella of what is considered expected in soccer but I don't think the injury is serious enough to stir prosecutors/police.

As far as I've seen most flags have been in Unionist areas and whether you like it or not the union flag is the flag of the country. Of course you could argue the Ulster Flag is our flag but people even get offended by that nowadays.
Saying all unionists are selfish, ignorant and agressive is just plain stupid. Again whilst our politicians may be like this I most certainly am not. Nor anyone I'm friends with that has a unionist view.

Let go of flags alltogether? Seriously? Ever coutnry flies its flag. Why should we be any different? Nationalists still fly the tricolour in their areas which is not the flag of the country at all. The Majority of unionists are against racisim and homophobia. Those that are against it are sadly a lot more vocal. Mainly from East Belfast or are politicians. 

Whilst I agree that playing sectarian songs during marches is not OK I don't see why we shouldn't be allowed to play hymns or march at all? Most unionsts attending the 12th parades are not doing it to annoy nationalists. They do it for fun and because we see it as part of our culture. Part of who we are! I don't think that should be taken away from us. 
I look at Ian Paisley and Martin Mcguinness as a shining example of what we could be doing here. They had a pretty good relationshipp and they TOLERATED eachother's culture and views. 
My son attends a mixed school and he can say confidently that the viewpoint of 90% of students their is to let it all go entirely, just leave things as they are and by the time his generation has got into government and grown up most of the bitter people will be gone or less vocal.

The arrogant professor smirked quite Hitlery and smugly replied “You know the difference, Romanians statistically commit more crime.”

”Well statistically Germans commit more GENOCIDE and I'd rather have my things stolen than be genocided”

He wished so much that he could end his life via doctor assisted suicide but he himself had campaigned against it!

The students applauded and all registered Labour that day and accepted Ed Miliband as their lord and savior. A pigeon named “Welfare Dependency” flew into the room and perched atop the communist flag and shed a tear on the chalk.

true,michael2l,null,null,"Lets be honest. The reason the biting is so shocking and appalling to some (hilariously ridiculous to other) is because we associate biting with animals, so our immediate reaction is to label the activity as sub-human.

It's more culturally acceptable to do other things that cause more physical damage, but don't call into question your status as a fellow human being. Biting is an instinctual sort of the thing though, a vestige of the fact that we are actually animals.

Typically when humans do it's not a conscious decision so much as an instinctual sort of thing.  It's typically involved in situations where people feel threatened to the point where they'll do anything to protect themselves and let their animal instincts take over as a sort of survival mechanism.  I've never experienced this, although my gf who is smaller than me has says when she gets really physically intimated by someone she has the urge to bite suddenly out of nowhere.  You also see biting often come into play in sexual situations, which is one of the few times where people feel comfortable indulging their animal instincts.

I've said this before but I think biting is something Suarez picked up as a smaller kid in Uruguay playing football with older, bigger kids who he probably was embarrassing on a regular basis, and who would likely respond with brute force to the punk kid that made them look bad.  The other thing biting does is signal to your opponent ""Don't fuck with me because I'm willing to do anything.""  It gives your opponent a socially acceptable reason to bow out of a physical confrontation with you, because you can say ""Hey, that kid bit me, what was I going to do, I don't want to get rabies.""  Not that Suarez would be thinking about that consciously, but it might explain why it played an effective role for him in defending himself as a kid, and why it comes out today in stressful situations.  His psyche on some base level sees it as an effective way of making the big bad defenders go away.

The emotions that lead him to this point where he loses control and feels so completely threatened is what he needs to deal with. But they are probably a huge part of what has driven him to the success he's achieved so far.  Suarez needs to win.  His psyche associates not-winning with a threat to his very existence.  I wonder if he successfully deals with those emotions if he will not simultaneously become a much different sort of player.

In reality, the 'Fleggers' DO NOT represent the majority of the Protestant community. It can seem that way because the DUP are chock full of politicians who take their cues from UKIP and the Tea Party and pander to the chip-on-their-shoulder minority. There is a rich, deep tradition of Protestant culture in Northern Ireland that is sadly lost among the flags and sashes. I mean, how many people know that Edward Carson played hurley for Trinity? Or that the 18th Century Nationalists (the United Irishmen) were predominantly Protestants who championed Gaelic music and the Irish language AGAINST the wishes of the Dublin govt.? The truth is that, when divorced from tribalism and washed clean of Orange, Unionism presents a compelling argument for all people in NI. As part of the UK we would have a greater say in International Affairs, a stronger currency and many other benefits that we would lose as part of a United Ireland.

If the neighbours rent and you know who their landlord is (you should be able to find out from the Land Registry IIRC) or if they are leaseholders, you could contact them or the freeholder. There are almost always clauses in rental/leasehold contracts about being considerate to the neighbours. In my case I wrote to the freeholder and they told my neighbour's landlord (ie the leaseholder) that if it continued they would have to evict him or face losing their leasehold.

Side note, but after looking at Article 48, the minimum ban for punching, kicking, etc. is 2 matches, while spitting is 6.

Also a large dog would obviously be purchased to alert the homeowners in the event of a break-in (legal), and for the [calming influence it would have on the household](http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/news/four_legged_visitor_helps_stressed_out_students_in_norwich_1_3631568). I don't think OP's friend will trick the offender into saying [""Rosebud""](http://www.columbo-site.freeuk.com/dialm2.htm) at this stressful time. So any resulting violence could hardly be blamed on the dog or the owner, should it ever get that far. 

I mean it would also help get the son out of the house, something that he probably needs. I'd be holed up in something resembling a giant panic room.

true,Fair-son,null,null,"I think you have hit upon a trend not just on this sub reddit, but in the wider media, social media and in general. Since the flag protests the general image of unionism has been in decline. 

Concerted protests which affected trading in the city centre and impacted on business ability to generate income, affected the Christmas market and generally pissed people off brought to light a side of unionism that we had not seen before. The emergence of Willie Frazer and Jamie Bryson as spokesmen, unelected representatives or whatever you see them as is indicative of this. The idea of a 'cultural identity' emerged into the main stream for the first time. 

Men like Bryson and Frazer are extremists that is the simple truth. They are political outliers. Now they and others like them have been given an undue amount of media coverage. This colours peoples perception of the 'PUL' community(PUL is also a new phrase in the cultural lexicon). 

Coupled with this is the perception of unionism as a massively conservative movement. Comments about gay marriage and other issues have alienated them from people, particularly the young who are more likely to frequent the likes of reddit(I assume anyway). This also adds to peoples perception.

More recently Peter Robinson's disastrous handling of the sectarian remarks of Pastor McConnell and the racist protest in east Belfast have led people to believe he is incompetent. 

On top of that(we have quite the pile now) you have had numerous completely bizarre episodes of the Nolan show(TV and radio) where people who have self identified as unionists or loyalists have made themselves look terrible see Tom Buchanan saying homosexuality is an abomination, George Galloway being told to go back to Britain, the fecking flags episode etc etc etc.  

So, IMHO we have an increase in the media coverage of the fringes of unionism, idiots being given too much airtime, conservative policies, poor leader ship from the biggest unionist party and of course the Nolan show. So as to why this sub reddit is anti unionist I would say all of those would be a reason perceive unionism negatively.

I'll try explain the bands and the twelfth. For many people it isn't just a stupid parade. It means a lot more. St Patricks day is the celebration of being Irish. Of the Irish culture and all of that. The twelfth is kind of a similar situation. It may have originally been to celebrate Protestant supremacy or whatever but it is not like that anymore. A lot of people just go to have a good time and it celebrates the unionist culture. A little bit like a protestant version of St Patricks day.
You can use that analogy to describe unionist anger when we aren't allowed to walk somewhere. Becasue St. Patricks day takes place in a shared space. And Interface areas are technically a shared space.
Also sometimes it is the police giving into violence like at twadell. Then theres the fact that it seems our culture is day by day being chipped at by Sinn Fein.

The way things currently stand is absolutely unacceptable.

Tolerance is an important thing to consider, and hopefully your son's generation will be just that more detached than ours. Let's hope so - that would be the best thing for everyone. But tolerance is a two way street - and you can't expect people to be tolerant of sectarianism under the guise of culture. Unionists, even those who enjoy a ""harmless"" march (if such a thing exists,) have to learn to be able to differentiate the two, something they currently do not.

Tolerance is also only part of the deal. The real responsibility lies with the extreme elements within Unionism (and of course Nationalism too) in catching up with the rest of us.

true,chendysworld,eng-Surrey,Surrey,"I agree a lot with /u/fineus but what you might not realise is a lot of companies put the restrictions on the jobs and job posting.
Recruitment is a very time consuming business and that's why companies outsource it to recruiters.

For your points
1 - Some companies don't want their name on the advert they outsource recruitment for a reason they will have to deal with hundreds of calls and emails from people, also as mentioned candidates will apply directly missing the recruiter out of the loop and other recruiters will use this as a lead and will go and bug the company to try and get their work.


2. Some companies require you to go through a certain process (blame HR) to fill out applications


3. Job sites charge the company website you are being linked to and for coming up in their searches and they need proof they they are the reason they are getting traffic to their website


4. This is ALL about the company, the recruiter does not make this up, some companies and so set on what they want so if somebody in HR says they need 2 years experience they will only read CVS with 2 years experience, a lot of businesses and so tight on their budgets it is rediculess. At the end of the day the recruitment company gets paid a percentage of your salary (not from your package just used to charge) so the higher your salary the more they get paid.

A lot of your complaints would be worse without recruiters

I understand that there are a lot of bad recruiters out there but most of them don't last very long in the job as can't get the job done, unfortunately all recruiters get treated the same and bashed, as an ex recruiters recently on the market I have spoken to a few and I know they tricks they are trying to play",0,1403708312,null,0,false,0,cigpcd6,t3_291mpe,t1_cigpcd6,t1_cigkz7n,null,1434397206,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

A friend of mine had her 5-year-old daughter(who absolutely loves him) write him a letter and include some photos from her Doctor Who-themed birthday party, and we were going to try to give it to him for her.

Are you paying for SO mobile too?
35 is pretty cheap for mobile+ internet, line rental for the landline is usually £15/mo alone. Getting a mobile plan as well as Internet for 20 quid is good going. 

Next steps, if you're that way inclined would be to settle in for 3 months. Make a note of everything you spend and then quantify your leftover for saving from there. 

Also, don't underestimate the power of nesting. Your SO (and you) will want to start to make the flat 'yours'. You'll end up buying books, small items of furniture, kitchen stuff that's missing etc. You should probably allocate a small monthly amount for that. 

Final nitpick:

£130/week for two people for food is a very good budget. Add in toiletries, sundries etc and it's still fine. 

Add in fun, in London, and prepare to be disappointed. You'll be paying for two which means say, a cheap diner out at a chain restaurant will be £40. Or 2x cinema tickets, £30 (and travel).

Ok, you might be doing nothing but free museums, but after a while you will want to begin to take advantage of the city and your salary. I think you should increase that substantially. I would double it.

Like I said, to some degree it worked at Ajax (if one assumes it was part of a plan and not just a random event) in that they accepted a reduced price below what they originally might have been expecting to receive.

Agreed it's a double asshole move entirely as it does precisely what you say and is one of the reasons I'm quite pissed at him.

&gt;The __Tizard Mission__, officially the __British Technical and Scientific Mission__, was a [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) delegation that visited the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) during the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) in order to obtain the industrial resources to exploit the military potential of the [research and development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development) (R&amp;D) work completed by the UK up to the beginning of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), but that Britain itself could not exploit due to the immediate requirements of war-related production. It received its popular name from the program's instigator, [Henry Tizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Tizard). Tizard was a British scientist and chairman of the [Aeronautical Research Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeronautical_Research_Committee), which had propelled the [development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_radar) of [radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar).

Android will be cheaper (possibly a lot cheaper), but the marketplace for apps is somewhat fragmented, and updates are not consistently available. An iPhone has only one app marketplace, the quality of the apps is generally higher IME, and you'll generally get OS updates more frequently and for longer.

true,michael2l,null,null,"Lets be honest. The reason the biting is so shocking and appalling to some (hilariously ridiculous to other) is because we associate biting with animals, so our immediate reaction is to label the activity as sub-human.

It's more culturally acceptable to do other things that cause more physical damage, but don't call into question your status as a fellow human being. Biting is an instinctual sort of the thing though, a vestige of the fact that we are actually animals.

Typically when humans do it, it's not a conscious decision so much as an instinctual sort of thing. It's typically involved in situations where people feel threatened to the point where they'll do anything to protect themselves and let their animal instincts take over as a sort of survival mechanism. I've never experienced this, although my gf who is smaller than me has says when she gets really physically intimated by someone she has the urge to bite suddenly out of nowhere. You also see biting often come into play in sexual situations, which is one of the few times where people feel comfortable indulging their animal instincts.

I've said this before but I think biting is something Suarez picked up as a smaller kid in Uruguay playing football with older, bigger kids who he probably was embarrassing on a regular basis, and who would likely respond with brute force to the punk kid that made them look bad. The other thing biting does is signal to your opponent ""Don't fuck with me because I'm willing to do anything."" It gives your opponent a socially acceptable reason to bow out of a physical confrontation with you, because you can say ""Hey, that kid bit me, what was I going to do, I don't want to get rabies.""

Not that Suarez would be thinking about that consciously, but it might explain why it played an effective role for him in defending himself as a kid, and why it comes out today in stressful situations. His psyche on some base level sees it as an effective way of making the big bad defenders go away.

The emotions that lead him to this point where he loses control and feels so completely threatened is what he needs to deal with. But they are probably a huge part of what has driven him to the success he's achieved so far. Suarez needs to win. His psyche associates not-winning with a threat to his very existence. I wonder if he successfully deals with those emotions if he will not simultaneously become a much different sort of player.

It's not necessarily racism.  People just write about what they know.  

But the BBC is taxpayer funded.  It has something of a duty to provide programming which caters to the demographics of the people who pay for the service.  So, I think minority viewers have some justification for asking that their population is better represented on screen.

IRAQI OIL

Kurds and ways

TWO British companies are likely to do very well from the chaos caused by ISIS fighters rampaging through Iraq.

In December last year, British firm Genel Energy, led by ex-BP boss Tony Hayward (pictured), completed the KRI (Kurdish Region of Iraq) pipeline from the Kurdish area of northern Iraq to Turkey, where oil and gas can be sold to international markets via a deep sea port. For his part in the thirsty work of completing the pipeline, Hayward, who left BP after a string of gaffes during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, trousered £1.78m in pay and bonus, together with his shareholding of £16.3m.

Genel has also found oil in the Kurdish north and this year hopes to make serious money by beginning to export it through its new pipeline. Alas, the fly in the ointment is Iraq's 2007 oil law, which created production sharing agreements between the major oil companies and Baghdad and obliges exporters to obtain consent from central government, as well as to pay taxes.

When Baghdad refused consent for Genel's planned exports, the firm went ahead anyway, pumping two loads of Kurdish oil through the new pipeline to a waiting ship in Turkey —before Baghdad's oil ministry stepped in with an arbitration suit to stop it being sold on world markets, effectively placing the shipments in limbo and thwarting Genel's plans.

Genel's efforts to operate out of the separatist and better organised Kurdish north may be helped by crumbling central authority in Baghdad. If matters degenerate to the point where Iraq breaks up, it opens the way for a Kurdish state to allow oil to be pumped through the pipeline and sold on international markets with sizeable profits for Genel and without the inconvenience of dealing with Baghdad.

A second British company in the area, meanwhile, is Gulf Keystone, marshalled by Lord Guthrie, former SAS colonel and once Tony Blair's favourite cutthroat. Guthrie served as chief of defence staff from 1997-2001; a year before leaving office he was already on the books of Gulf Keystone. The firm has invested in oil wells since 2000 solely in Kurdish north Iraq and now owns four sites which recently became productive. All Gulf Keystone needs is access to Hayward's pipeline and sufficient security to get the oil out. Humungous profits may await.

Both these British companies have benefited hugely from improved stability in the northern Kurdish region following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. But when profits flow in for the pair, very little will end up with the Exchequer. Gulf Keystone is traded on the London Stock Exchange but registered in Bermuda; Genel Energy is based in Jersey and paid less than 1 percent tax on company profits to the exchequer in the last financial year.

Quite apart from the human cost, a recent book by the Royal United Service Institute conservatively estimated the financial cost of the Iraq war to UK taxpayers at £9.56bn.

It will be interesting to see if the Chilcot inquiry into the war focuses on energy interests in the region in the run-up to the 2003 invasion, or solely on Blair's simpering relationship with his American counterpart, George W Bush.

I put 'hereditary upper house' as a way of showing one of the bits which interests me--you want a system for one house which gets away from democracy (to avoid popularity politics) and away from appointment (to avoid cronyism and excessive ambition). It's also nice to have longer-serving members to balance out the chop and change of elected governments. It's also nice to have people who are financially independent so they are less swayable by commercial temptations.

There's something to be said for a second chamber made up like a jury--people pulled from random walks of life who are there out of duty and not out of personal ambition but it fails on some of the points I mentioned above.

(And I'm very much in favour of the Lords Spiritual.)

Firstly is that he has done it 3 times now, which makes it so much worse than an individual incident of madness. He has shown that it is a repeated problem for him and that he has a genuine psychological disorder. 

Secondly, is that whilst most terrible things that players do on the pitch are in some way provoked (Take Zidane in the world cup), all 3 times Suarez has bitten somebody it has been almost totally unprovoked and off the ball.

Thirdly, and this one might be a bit unfair, but biting another player is just a bizzare thing to do. If you have ever played football (semi) competitively, you can understand why a lot of players lash out and stamp or kick another player when they are frustrated, angry, tired, etc. but biting another player is just an unthinkable thing to do! it's worlds apart form keeping a foot in a hard challenge because you're pissed off. it's just an assault.

true,redstarduggan,,Belfast,"&gt; How exactly are Sinn Fein chipping away at your culture?

I'll answer this, because I think it's something that is often overlooked. There are two parts to it, firstly SF have been heavily involved in the organisation of anti-parade protests, which in itself is fine and we all accept that parades should be discussed and agreed between both parties. As part of this however, they are also involved in demonising the orders, and unionists in general to an extent. It isn't always public, and it isn't always obvious but it happens, and it happens primarily because SF are far more able political animals than any unionist group are.

Secondly, and this goes back many years, there is a sense within moderate unionism that their sense of 'Irishness' has been stripped. They no longer feel able to describe themselves as Irish because of the obvious connotations that now applies. The feeling that this 'Irishness' has been hijacked is fairly prevalent. It should be pointed out however that in recent years this has slightly reversed.

After writing that I feel obliged to mention my own position. I am not a member of any order, nor ever will be. My exposure to my own culture has been from very young however, having been involved with bands and parading since I could hold a triangle. I don't believe that parades in themselves are inherently sectarian the way we normally describe things as sectarian. Clearly they are not inclusive and not designed to be but they do not exist for the purposes of 'taig bashing'.

I don't like the terms 'unionist' or 'loyalist'. I am hugely in favour of maintaining Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom but I do not identify with any mainstream political parties. I consider myself British, with all the baggage that entails on this island. I also consider myself Irish. I was born on this island and I am proud of this island. I struggle to understand how anyone else in a similar position cannot consider themselves as Irish. 100 years ago the protestants/unionists who built the most famous ship in the world were Irish and fiercely proud of it.

I take your point though, I do think Sinn Fein have done pretty damn well in some respects as a party. Not far enough in abortion rights, assisted dying, drink opening hours, less obvious stuff than what dominates the usual tribal narrative here - but I guess they have to cater to the conservative catholic crowd. They were against the Iraq war, they've renounced violence and you're right, the DUP and the other protestant parties always want to drag it back to the Troubles, even though Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness and Gerry Kelly and all the rest of them are clearly not being terrorists now. 

But that still doesn't really excuse the unacceptable attitude that Sinn Fein leaders, Gerry Adams for example, have towards victims. There was a Spotlight on Jean McConville recently. That always irks me. 

I understand that Catholics were not treated fairly. Worse than that. Jesus. The things my girlfriend's dad tells me about growing up in the New Lodge in the 70s. It's crazy. So I can understand why the IRA did what they did, although I don't accept that innocents were fair game, regardless of the rationalisations they still try and peddle. My Granny and Granda were nearly killed on Bloody Friday (but then again, who's werent.)

I think that's more the kind of thing he's probably referring to, but I don't know. It's more the fact that nationalists think they're whiter than white, especially on this subreddit - but even if you believed in the cause, not everybody agrees that the cost to the victims was worth it. I find the idea repugnant that people try and justify that.

Was the first time I'd ridden a bike in exactly a year (since we did the same thing last year).

Wasn't particularly safe as I had no lights and it was well past 11 by the time we poled up at the last pub.  
Landlord (who was with us on the ride) had his missus lay on a big spread for us when we got back, which was nice.

I think there are a lot of reasons that this incident could be the one. For one, I always give someone the chance to change. I don't know Suarez personally enough to even give an opinion about his likelihood to change his conduct, let alone say definitively one way or the other. But he had a quiet and respectful year at Liverpool during which he played amazingly. I think it's fair to say he played like someone who lost the bit of instability and potential anger that he had in him, in my opinion. I thought he had turned a leaf with having more success at club level and through the adequate support from Liverpool, BR and teammates that it seemed he was receiving. Clearly, that isn't the case, or at least it seems it isn't the case that he can play away from that support system without conduct issues.

All-in-all, this incident should be depressing for us. Luis Suarez is a huge point of pride for me as a Liverpool fan, as he is (in my estimation) the third best player in the world and he plays for my club. I'm as proud of him being a LFC player as I am that there are 6 players for LFC in the England squad and 5 of them started 2 matches. He has now become a lightning rod for shame and embarrassment in football. No, not necessarily related to Liverpool, but it's hard to get as much enjoyment out of his association when he does this.

It doesn't mean you can just stab them, what you're meant to do is *subdue* by the least forceful means possible. The upshot is that you can't tell your friend to buy a gun or a tazer or a cricket bat or anything, although the first two aren't available anyway. If the guy gets into the house she can most likely club him over the head with a lamp, but if she hits him with a cricket bat conveniently placed by the door it's going to count as a weapon. The best real self defence option is going to one of those self defence classes, there's normally a female centric one close by or she could do Judo or something.

Honestly your best defence is real defence. Strong doors, locked windows, an alarm, maybe a big dog and some visible CCTV. If it were me I'd probably change the locks to be on the safe side. Consider moving, or maybe look into a restraining order to force the creep to move, but I'm not sure if that's allowed. Restraining orders are just paper anyway.

You also find that the bands who want to be noticed for the music don't quite play so much of the identifiable 'loyalist' songs. I'd be quite happy if the music were restricted to military march type music.

They focus on issues of homelessness, social exclusion, drug and alcohol addiction, family breakdown etc. and they have a lettings branch which specifically deals with finding affordable transition accommodation for people who are on the road to recovery. There is a problematic shortage of suitable housing for single men as shelter and half-way houses tend to be more geared toward women and families. 

As well as looking for accommodation for clients there's also a need for spaces for things like art and music therapy classes, support groups etc. 

One thing to mindful of is that many of the clients have significant background issues, criminal records, mental health problems etc and so you would need to be aware of the risks.

&gt;

&gt;__Ned__ is a derogatory term applied in [Scotland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland) to [hooligans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooliganism), louts or [petty criminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petty_criminal),   latterly with the stereotypical implication that they wear casual [sports clothes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportswear_(activewear\)).   Such usage in [Glasgow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow) dates back to the 1960s or earlier.

What happens if he bites someone again?  Does he simply get the same sanction each time?  Is there ever a point at which he loses his right to play because he does not respect the other players?

Not meant as an attack.  I am of the opinion he needs a lengthy ban from all comps, for a long time at this juncture, and I am curious amongst those who aren't, whether it's a matter of giving him another chance, of three times being insufficient, but four or five being enough, or whether it's just an each-incident on its own paradigm for you.

They win those seats by cultivating small local groups of diehard supporters who they can expect to vote a certain way based on a particularly politicised perspective. Those groups keep the Conservative/Labour expectation going, as they are easily pitted against each other, and will get behind the surest means of expressing their basic standpoint, even if the party has many policies they disagree with.

If voter turnout was closer to 100% and the question was truly national instead of local, the result would be very different.

If you are not looking after yourself there is little point worrying about anyone else, because then you won't be around to help anyone.

I obviously don't know the full details of what happened with you and him. If it was something minor (like a low level assault or more controlling behaviour than full on criminal offence) you would most likely be able to report this to the police and explain to them you do not wish any action to be taken, will not help any prosecution and you are only providing this in case of future incidents with other persons to show a history of behaviour.

If, however, it is a more serious offence (serious injury, sexual in nature, or shows an immediate risk to children/others) they may be obligated to help despite your wishes.

Only you can decide what you should do, but rest assured there is no right answer. Your best solution is to speak to people close to you, and look at yourself, and see what you think is best. It may be in several months/years you change your mind.

I, along with most fans I suspect, have a problem with it because it has never been mentioned before the movie and has never since been mentioned.

The idea that humans one day evolve into Time Lords after mastering the Time Vortex, on the other hand, is an interesting concept.

 The movie took a lot of liberties in trying to make Doctor Who seem more interesting, and it didn't really succeed with most people, so now we find ourselves trying to explain away the non-canon stuff because we like Paul McGann and he's counted as #8 in the new series - unlike the Peter Cushing version, which is ignored by most.

true,lfc80,lfc12,,"First, I think Suarez's case has to do with his history.  I don't exactly recall English media coverage, but I would suspect it wasn't as HUGE of a deal when Liverpool first bought him.  

Second, it is the perception of biting in our culture.  Biting is something that is associated with rabid animals, zombies, and toddlers/babies.  Unlike punching, stamping,  kicking, or whatever, which are generally seen as virile acts of tough frustrated men, biting is seen as an act that is only done by those that have lost or have no control.  It is preternatural for rational adults and unexplainable. 

Unfortunately, Suarez himself, probably couldn't explain why he did it until he talks it through with a therapist.  I wouldn't doubt that his reasoning of ""these are things that happen on the pitch"" was a genuine response because he wasn't himself for that instant.  

This isn't me saying that he shouldn't be held accountable for it, but I will say that if anyone thought he was completely rehabilitated from his past transgressions, then they have no understanding of how depression, anger and anxiety works.",0,1403723037,null,0,false,0,cigwr50,t3_291zog,t1_cigwr50,t1_cigt98g,null,1434400767,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1
true,MarxIzalias,null,null,"I don't find the testimony of a whistle-blower stating that he is paid to make assessments that favour the state to take kids away from decent people as hilarious as you do, or the information that there is a minimum number of cases that social services have to create to justify their expenses.
 
Also, if we are going from personal, anecdotal experience, perhaps you can explain why mothers keep coming to me asking for advice in order to have their kids returned to them because social services have either; stretched the truth, created hyperbolic situations out of unavoidable injuries, have outright lied on the stand in court and hired professional witnesses (whom they have never met) to talk about their character and psychological condition. Even in the face of their own family doctor's findings.

One mother, who has had a premature baby and spends every day visiting hospital to look after the child, is currently under investigation for 'being a bad mother', when clearly, her dedication is second to none.
Another case, where the father accidentally hurt a baby and then immediately called for an ambulance in the mothers absence, only to be betrayed by the staff and had the child taken away from the mother, she has fought tooth and nail to get the child back even though it was clearly a one-off, accident and it later turned out, that her character had been slandered in court, by using information that applied to her sister and not her.
 
Another case, much more publicised, and referenced above, involving brittle bone disease, where the parents were accused of abuse, only to find out months later that it is a condition that often results in unavoidable injury.

I don't think I should go on, but there was the unfortunate case where a child was taken away from its parents and then the foster parents killed the child. 

I should also mention that, nobody can judge a person's character easily and hindsight is 20/20, after all, Fred West was such a nice guy, he was even a mayoral candidate, that is: until they dug up his yard.

I could keep listing incidences but I don't think it would be very prudent to show the darker side of social services and the ineptitude of presumption and means testing because, clearly, the sun shines from whence the shit flows as far as you are concerned.

Baring in mind, the system of appeals for a court which operates in secret is very limited, leaving the parents with very little recourse but to submit to a kangaroo system that has no option of a jury, as is a persons usual legal entitlement.

The death of baby-p should not be an excuse to over-zealously tear families apart and damage them beyond repair.",0,1403723045,null,0,false,0,cigwra2,t3_28uv8b,t1_cigwra2,t1_cigu62r,null,1434400771,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0
true,StatesideKopite,null,null,"My fault, it wasn't you, it was the person I originally responded to who used those words.  Either way, my point above stands because the person I was responding to clearly isn't qualified to make that assertion.  I know this because he called the people laughing ""retards"" in his post; something a mental health professional would never do. 

I don't think your analogy is very applicable either, seeing as walking down the street isn't near as stressful as, say, being 10 minutes from elimination in the World Cup.  That is, if you're saying whatever he may suffer from is a result of stressful situations.  It's entirely possible that he is just extremely immature and acts out when things aren't going his way.

true,MadArend,num20,,"Absolutely not.  

I was not born to Spurs, so maybe I would feel differently if Spurs were the heritage of my family and childhood community.  But for me, it was the character of the team and of the club that cemented my love for them, so the Suarez case provides a great example:

* How could a club that partly defines itself by its long-held stand against anti-Semitism go and buy someone who was banned 8 games for racial abuse?  
* How could a club that ever strives for the ""echo of glory"" employ someone who repeatedly behaves like a diseased animal?
* How would supporting a player who repeatedly and unapologetically cheats be anything other than an insult to the legacy of Bill Nick: ""It's no use just winning, we've got to win well.""

I want dearly for us to cultivate and acquire world-class talent.  Give me Messi, give me Benzema -- hell, give me today's more mature Rooney -- and I'll do aerial somersaults.  But never someone like Suarez.  Nor, for that matter, someone like Terry, or Tevez, or, somewhat differently, Balotelli.

TL;DR: *I'll take Michael Dawson or Sandro Raniere over Luis Suarez every day of the week and twice on Sunday.*

I'm not trying to defend him, what he has done is unacceptable and he should be banned for it (only internationally though but thats another arguement), but I can see why he has done it.

Liverpool and Man Utd are the two most successful clubs in the history of English football. Liverpool in particular have fantastic fans and you can see this at any home game in [The Kop](http://www.empireofthekop.com/anfield/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/The-Kop.jpg). Man Utd have the largest (club) stadium in the country and their away fans are held in high regard, although their home games tend to be relatively sterile in terms of support because there are a lot of 'glory hunters' or corporate seats there which water down the atmosphere a bit. 

Of the remaining clubs you mentioned (Spurs and Arsenal), Arsenal have had much more success in recent years, winning the Premier League and FA Cup, competing in the Champions League for the past 8 (or possibly 10?) seasons, whereas Spurs have been in and out of the Europa League and haven't quite been able to match Arsenal in terms of achievement. My own personal preference between the two is Arsenal as they seem to make more of an effort in developing youth and play a lovely brand of passing football that's beautiful on the eye. [See this goal.](https://38.media.tumblr.com/4b1809670d65217946517061d8aa6037/tumblr_muxvdjmo111rg3v37o1_400.gif). Arsenal also have the longest serving current manager in the Premier League in Arsene Wenger who is very highly regarded across club allegiances.

For more information it would be worth checking out each club's subreddit:

/r/reddevils - Man Utd

/r/LiverpoolFC - Liverpool

/r/mcfc - Man City

/r/chelseafc - Chelsea

/r/gunners - Arsenal

/r/coys - Spurs

OR of course /r/soccer (when the World Cup has finished there will be much more club football talk!).

All in all I'm glad to hear you've chosen to foliow The Beautiful Game - it's a fantastic sport and one I've loved all my life. If you've got any specific questions I'll do my best to answer :) It's also worth stating I'm only 23 so have only known the League as long as it's been branded the Premier League, so the info above only really relates to the era post 1990 but hopefully will have been interesting nonetheless!",0,1403725009,null,0,1403725299,0,cigxsef,t3_292xqe,t1_cigxsef,t3_292xqe,null,1434401316,9,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,9

From experience, while the array of stuff they sell isn't massive, compared to the big supermarkets, everything is quite a bit cheaper, and just as good, and in many cases, far better quality. 

Right now, they do a really nice malted bloomer loaf for a quid. A QUID! I've not found anything on par with that in any of my other local supermarkets. 

1kg Frozen chicken breast fillets for 4 quid? Done. Extra Virgin Olive oil for less than 3 quid? I'll have some of that thanks. 

Oh, and the chocolate. Now, i've mentioned it before, but their dairyfine chocolate range tastes far superior to that horrible sweetened wax that cadburys tries to pawn off as chocolate. Ingredients actually list cocoa butter, and no vegetable fat added, at least in the bigger bars &amp; 99p bags of chocolate buttons. 

On top of all that, there's no bullshit involved, no presentation to try and 'wow' the customers into buying it just *plonk* 'there you go, food. No time wasting involved at the checkouts either, just blip everything through and you pack it yourself at the bench, rather than holding up whoever is behind you in the queue. All very efficient.

true,Cepheid,cnty-uk,Nomad,"Yes there were some other factors. In the end though, not protecting the deposit is a slam dunk against the landlord, and it takes 5 minutes to check it online as there are only 3 bodies that the landlord (or in your case, the estate agent) can legally use to protect the deposit.

It was a private contract between us and the landlord, and she had led us to believe we were the sole tenants of a property, when in actual fact it was 9 people crammed into 5 rooms with only 1 bathroom.

We were there for a week or so and we moved out and demanded the deposit back, she said that because we didn't complete the 3 month contract, we couldn't have the deposit back.

I knew there was no real way to resolve this, but also because she was so shady and playing fast and loose with HMO (housing with multiple occupants) laws, I checked to see if she had protected our deposit (after the advice) and she hadn't.

We only really wanted the deposit back, but in the end she had to pay through the nose because she was so shitty to us while also neglecting her landlord duties.

I think it's almost by design that the fine for not protecting deposit is so high, because it's a minimum requirement for a landlord that is very easy. So any landlord that isn't doing it is neglecting a very simple requirement.

In terms of the cultures, visit the different subs for their history and cultures: /r/LiverpoolFC /r/Gunners /r/RedDevils /r/ChelseaFC /r/Coys /r/MCFC

I'm very biased as a Liverpool fan but this is my opinion on the teams;

* Liverpool - rich history especially in 1970s and 80s with massive success in England and Europe. For a long time the most successful English team (some would argue they still are if the European success is weighted more than other success). Suffered from the change to the BPL from Division 1 and haven't won the top flight since 1990. Have a couple of large tragedies in our history (Hillsborough, Heysel) which are still very powerful for those closely involved with the club. Currently on the rise after our best season for 20 or so years, definitely an ""up and coming"" team. Have arguably the world's best and certainly most controversial striker in Luis Suarez. He's a nutter but he's bloody good at football.

* United - Currently in a transition period having lost the most successful manager in history last year (Sir Alex Ferguson). Had their worst ever BPL finish this year (7th) with an ageing squad that desperately needs to be overhauled. Have a good history since he took over and also the ""Busby Babes"" in the 50s. Also have a large disaster in the form of Munich. They have a massive fan base and are the most successful team in terms of top flight championships (20). 

* Arsenal - the team that's always been there but never been spectacular (except the Invincible season in 2003). Consistently qualifying for Europe but haven't won much for a while except the FA cup this year. I'm not very well versed on their history but afaik they've always been a relatively ""there or thereabouts"" team. At one point held the record for most top division titles. 

* Spurs - probably the outsider of those stated. Haven't won the top division since the 60s and haven't own much else since. They're constantly underachieving. Have to admit I'm not very knowledgable about them either. They do create the odd world class player (Gareth bale for example) but they're very unpredictable.

* City &amp; Chelsea - I'm going to clump these two together because although some people disagree I see them as very similar. Very little history before they got taken over by billionaires willing to throw money at the club to buy top players and then have gone on to be relatively successful. Renowned for just buying titles and firing managers at will. Chelsea have the infamous Mourinho as manager at the moment who is a bit of a nut job but can be amusing to watch in interviews. They have amazing talent in their teams but unless you support them you'll probably feel like they haven't earned anything, like a rich kid who gets bought nice cars...they haven't done anything to deserve it other than have lots of money. 
Also get accused of having ""plastic"" (ie; fake) fans because of their somewhat rapid rise to success.

As for the quality - personally I've found meat/ham to be every bit as good (if not better) as the larger shops. Things like bread, milk, baked beans, tuna, cola are also pretty indistinguishable.

Yes, lots of geniuses have some degree of madness as do many non-geniuses.  Lots of geniuses have no serious mental problems at all.  It's a lazy justification of bad behaviour.  Suarez is an amazing player.  Genius? maybe.  He's also a bit of an idiot, who has a history of violent conduct on the pitch going back to his pre-professional days.  Do you really think that his behaviour is excusable because of his talent?

Listing 4 great footballers who did stupid things does not make that comment correct, sorry.  There are just as many and, I would wager, more who have displayed no signs of madness whatsoever.  

No player, or non-player, with serious problems should be denied the help they need to help them function in the society they live and work.  Nor should they be deprived of the support of the people who love and care for them and want to see them get better.

New Who has several advantages over Classics. For example, there's a lot less parts to a story so we don't need to worry about which part, if the quiz asks for it. There's a lot more variety, with a lot less episodes. But mostly, because of what I said before. The shots. They're *all* unique to an episode with something pretty massive giving it away. None of them are even remotely similar. Like, it's not just choosing a shot of them walking about or in the TARDIS. Things like characters/creatures/costumes that only ever appeared in one episode. Or things like 10 being in PJs in bed, which was a massive bit of the episode.

But yes, you're right. It's a very dependant thing and while I'm very confident I can speak for the majority in saying that New Who is far easier than Classic Who in this sort of thing, I agree that's not everyone.

Yes, he gives shit to referees. Yes, he sometimes dives (though no more than other star attackers). Yes, he bit someone on the pitch thrice (no qualifier here, it's disgraceful). But all his teammates ever say about him at Liverpool and with Uruguay is that they wouldn't have anyone else playing with them in the side. And that is good enough for me, as someone with only a small piece of the information.

But, no--you're right. You probably do know better about his qualities as a teammate and his affect on Liverpool's legacy, being a Chelsea supporter rather than a Liverpool/Uruguay player.

* Spent a good few weeks in hostel (a bedroom with a lock, a curfew time of 10pm) Some annoying scumbags were there but mostly people who didn't have a choice and were at their lowest point through no fault of their own.

* Got points from the housing executive. Was on list for massive area in Belfast. (not fussy, needed home)

* Resisted getting a private rented house as I couldn't afford £400-£500pm + all the other shit you need when I would find work again.

* Waited for a while, odd temp job here and there. 

* until a flat came up

* Took it on.

* Was able to get a proper job again.

Sucks. Hated it at the time, hate thinking back at it. Still it wasn't that bad considering. 

*edit*  

If you have no home of your own, you are technically homeless. I think even sleeping on a friends sofa is considered ""homeless"". My sleeping in a hostel was considered ""homeless"".

Firstly because they have a group punishment system, a productivity based bonus (number of man-hours required to run the shop over price of products sold). Under this system staff work unpaid overtime in order to meet targets and the bonus is good enough that colleagues will turn on anyone who challenges this. This includes illness because hours from sick days are included in the productivity calculation, it includes disability because time to unpack a pallet or stack a shelf is measured, and of course there is no such thing as a ""two-man"" box, wasting man-minutes protecting your back means you have to stay later unpaid tonight. 

If someone is under-performing or builds friendships with other staff members then it's standard practice to ship that member of staff off to the most distant store in their area, adding 4 hours of driving time to a 12 hour day is a great way to make someone quit.

If you do work there and are in the process of being constructively dismissed then keep in mind that they know that their practices are illegal, and that this is reflected by their shush-money.

true,OldManDubya,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"&gt; We may not have been overtly aggressive to Russia, but don't pretend we haven't been playing games, and that we don't have geopolitical ambition in the area.

Well yes, we have ""geopolitical ambitions"" just like Russia does. It's just that Russia's geopolitical ambitions look like Aleksandyr Lukashenko or Nursultan Nazarbayev, and ours look like the Baltics or Poland. You can play the equivalence game but frankly I think our ambitions are less malevolent than theirs. Does it suit us to have liberal democracies and market economies in those regions? Of course it does. But don't tell me that people are better off in Belarus than they are in Poland.

Russia (or more accurately, the Kremlin) wants to preserve at least some of its historical sphere of influence and to install friendly regimes over the heads of the people of those regions to satisfy their own longstanding paranoia. We could be more sensitive to that paranoia but I don't see why the people of Ukraine have to suffer for it if it can be avoided.

&gt;It was looking like a legitimately elected pro-Russian leader was being ousted to make way for a pro-EU leader, which would almost certainly have meant NATO anti-missile systems and a weakening of Russian influence and power.

I really don't think it will mean anything of the sort - indeed, America doesn't even want to put missiles in Poland anymore. Or at least they didn't until the invasion of Crimea.

Also democracy is about more than winning the most votes - for that word to truly mean anything it has to be accompanied by a genuine attempt to respect the rule of law, to govern in the national interest as far as you see it and govern in good faith and not merely to share the spoils of victory. 

Yanukovych (who let's not forget tried to rig his last attempt to win the office of President) won because of the disastrous failures of the Orange Movement; he hardly had a ringing endorsement from the people to govern. This did not stop him getting busy establishing a crony state that would further ruin Ukraine, and hoped to fund it in exchange for selling his country out to a Russian customs union that the people of his country clearly did not want.

In a normal nation I wouldn't have sympathy for trying to enforce policy in the way the opposition, but realistically they had every reason to fear that Yanukovych and Russia would ensure that people with their political priorities would never hold power again. Yanukovych would not have run away to exile if he thought these were just a bunch of sore losers.

Also, the west did not in any way agitate for this revolution. It came from the internal political dynamics in Ukraine - we provided tacit verbal and moral support, and once the protesters were successful we wasted no time in providing aid to the new government. But Russia was also attempting to bribe the kleptocrats into taking Ukraine his way.

In the end there was, it is agreed, a free and fair election that followed events in Kiev. In Crimea we had a hasty referendum under the watch of a foreign army that was [flawed at best](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimea_referendum,_2014).

In my opinion there is no moral equivalence here, and this was not merely some ""Great Game"" style power play.

&gt;* 2000 - [Marty McSorley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_McSorley) of the Boston Bruins hit [Vancouver Canuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks) [Donald Brashear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Brashear) in the head with his stick in the waning moments of the game, after losing a fight to Brashear earlier in the game. McSorley was convicted of assault with a weapon and given an 18-month conditional discharge.

&gt;* 2004 - In the [Todd Bertuzzi - Steve Moore incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Bertuzzi_-_Steve_Moore_incident), Bertuzzi of the Vancouver Canucks [sucker-punched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sucker_punch) [Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Moore) of the Colorado Avalanche in the back of the head, knocking him unconscious. The pair then fell to the ice with Bertuzzi's weight crushing Moore face-first into the ice, followed by several players from both teams further piling onto the [mêlée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%AAl%C3%A9e). Moore sustained three fractured vertebrae, a [grade three concussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion#Grading_systems), vertebral ligament damage, stretching of the brachial plexus nerves, and facial lacerations. Bertuzzi was charged by police, and given a conditional discharge after pleading guilty to assault causing bodily harm. His suspension resulted in a loss of $500,000 in pay and the Canucks were fined $250,000. Bertuzzi was re-instated in 2005; Moore has not played since and made several unsuccessful attempts at civil litigation.
