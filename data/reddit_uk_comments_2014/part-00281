See, Time Heist was interesting in the fact that they jump you in and work from a backwards viewpoint. You're supposed to start off not knowing anything. You're supposed to make sense out of the jumble at the end, the same way that the characters themselves had to.

There is no character development, true. But I feel that that contributes to the whole flashback-style writing that this episode contains.  It's not just a simple progression of cause to effect, event A to event B, but more of a wibbly wobbley timey wimey stuff. Throughout, Clara and the Doctor get to know their companions better, and we get to learn along with them. It's not that omnipotent ""You as the viewer gets to know all the details"" as with seemingly every show, every book, every episode on TV and in film.

And speaking of time, that quote comes from the episode *Blink*, which many also agree is one of the best episodes in New Who. That's another episode which touched on the story of time travel.

I'm relatively new to Reddit (signed up years ago, but only been using it a couple of weeks), so would have bolded if I could but apparently HTML  doesn't work on here. It wasn't meant to show shoutiing - I apologise if that's how it came off.

You're saying people hadn't made a 10-or-so-episode season with a single, continuous 'mission'-style story, after setting it in the same mega-series as an already-created show before, though, except I gave a clear example where they had - Auf Wiedersehen, Pet's second season. That much is definitely inclusive, as it's pretty much the same, exact scenario of form as here, so less inclusive and more ""exactly the same"".

The reason I'm convinced you think that is because whenever I say it WAS a brilliant TV season that changed up what had come before (on that specific series, I mean, not the TV landscape in general), and then give actual other shows that used the same form to actually disprove your point about it being original, you don't debate the merits of how good it actually was, but keep wanting to highlight it as original (which it simply, factually, historically was not, sorry again). That, of course, makes me think you value originality over actual good, believable, dramatic writing. Because you keep tryng to prove this was original than simply accept ""Hey, it may not be original in the way I thought it was, but at least it was the best version of something that'd come before"", which is by far a better achievement - besting something that had been done decades before you were even born is far better than failing at something you yourself invented. People remember Usain Bolt and give him more acclaim than some guy who invented a sport that no-one picked up and carried on using, and for good reason. Anyone can be average at something they invent - it's harder to be better than everyone else at something that's already been invented.

Now, since you quoted my actual point and then continued to talk about the name, I'm convinced that you care more about what to call it is and that name's exclusivity (which is irrelevant to the actual argument - 'a rose by any other name' comes to mind; you can call it whatever you want, but the fact it isn't original is the main point and the 'smell' of the argument) than trying to argue my point about Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. So I'm guessing you now know it isn't that original since you've given up that angle of argument and instead try to insult my definition.

Well fine, I know I'm not perfect with definitions and naming things, I never said I was, but the things I brought up about originality and examples of things that've come before, you've not even tried to argue against, so I'll stop replying now since you don't seem interested in arguing the actual point that you yourself brought up any more.

They can ask for a referendum. It is up to Westminster whether they will allow one (or whether they will respect the result).

I doubt they'd give a fuck. And if their hand was forced, Scotland would get a very harsh response which would be 100% backed by 55 million English, and probably half of Scottish people too. Let's not forget, 20% more people wanted to stay than wanted to go ;)

Rather than suggesting that people be moved with the economic tides, why don't we look at why social housing existed in the first place.

We pay a high level of tax in this country. We pay that tax not to subsidise Vodafone, Amazon and the like, but to pay for the social contract that was set up at the end of WW2. 

There are lots of things in that contract, almost all of which have been sold down the river by nearly 35 years of neo-Liberal economic policies. 

One of those things was that the government would pay for houses, particularly for poor people, in the Urban Centres that they have settled in after the Agricultural and Industrial revolution.

After WW2 we built loads of houses as a nation. Particularly in the SE. And then Thatcher and her gang sold them off for votes. 

What that means is that since then, particularly in relation to housing, the Government has not kept its side of the contract. 

Often, the people who are most against the ""lazy poor,"" who they think should move away from their support networks, towards wherever housing is cheapest (creating ghettoes for them to not worry about along the way) are the same people who sold their council housing. 

""My Mum and Dad,"" they will say ""worked hard to keep a roof over our heads, but these teenage layabouts are having children too young and we are all having to pay."" 

Well, your Mum and Dad were beneficiaries of the very same social contract that this generation and the one before lost out on. And they chances are they are the lucky ones.

We got crappy education, our jobs were given away to huge corporations to farm out on 0 hours contracts, and the social housing that underpinned their families no longer exist.  

They also probably had kids way younger than you will probably be able to afford to (You know, at an age where humans are better able to produce viable babies without test tubes etc, but that is another story). 

The things that make Mum and Dads retirement are probably property speculation in one form or another. Either that or they are poor. Or for about 1% of the population they inherited loads of cash.

We still pay the taxes, but the Government don't supply us with the things they are meant to for the money.

Reddit uses [Textile markup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_%28markup_language%29) - enclose something in double asterisks to make it bold, \*\*like so** (**example**)

&gt;You're saying people hadn't made a 10-or-so-episode season with a single, continuous 'mission'-style story, after setting it in the same mega-series as an already-created show before, though, except I gave a clear example where they had - Auf Wiedersehen, Pet's second season

No, I'm saying that Torchwood's level of story-telling continuity and dependence (delving more than just an arc) is extremely uncommon - especially in its genre. I could name hundreds of serials that have seasons revolving around a single arc, but they're still rather episodic in nature, and none of them are even close to the level of depth that Torchwood had digging through the Family conspiracy.

The first (and only) counter-example you've provided is not only from a *wildly* different style of show, it's also from 1986. I think that highlights the rarity of that type of television.

&gt;I'm convinced that you care more about what to call it [...] than trying to argue my point about Auf Wiedersehen, Pet

This is for three reasons:

1: when you rebut ""x is uncommon"" with ""x is y and y has been done before"", it's kind of important that you make sure that x is actually y.

(yes you could probably argue that Torchwood wouldn't count either, under that criteria, but that's why I want it back!)

2: I have not watched Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, nor do I intend on doing so, so I have no reason to argue whether it's comparable in terms of pure level continuity.

3: If you were to take my original comment to be 100% literal (as in, ""Torchwood is literally the only current show to do a season with an overlying arc"", which is definitely not the intent and also a really really dumb interpretation), Auf Wiedersehen, Pet still wouldn't be a valid counter-example, as the last (non-special) episode was over a decade ago.

Most social housing in England is owned by housing associations. They charge a near economic rent. Some of their capital costs are covered by government grants, but the majority is borrowed from banks, building societies and corporate bonds. Social housing in London is funded by the  Greater London Authority; I expect this is met by a central government grant but I don't really know. 

I don't know why the minimum wage isn't weighted by area. This would make sense to me, but maybe there are unintended consequences. But even then people on lower incomes would struggle to afford housing, and as soon as they lost their jobs they would be effectively homeless.

false,PartManAllMuffin,eng-sussex,Canadian in Sussex,"It's an interesting concept.  In Canada, where I'm both originally from and studied politics, the system works* because of the basic constitutional structure is laid out fairly logically.

In the constitution there are specific powers enumerated for each level of government.

Basically, the provinces have sole power over:

* Education
* Health Care
* Transport
* Labour
* Housing

+ A bunch of other stuff, but those are the big five.

As a result, they also have the power to raise their own taxes.

Basically, the Federal government has power over:

* Defence
* Foreign affairs
* Immigration

+ A bunch of other stuff... and importantly anything not specifically enumerated. That's why ""recent"" developments that require regulating like broadcasting, air transport, etc are all federal in Canada.

The Feds are also responsible for laws based on promoting Peace, Order and Good Government across the country.

Because the Feds have the biggest chequebook, they can also force the provinces to harmonise their services, even though they have different legislative bases.  That's why Ontario's health care system is more or less the same as BC's.  (Theoretically, Ontario could completely change it's health care system - but then it would get it's cheque or have other services withheld by the feds.)

Hence:

*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_transfer_payments
*http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization_payments_in_Canada

It seems to me that a federalised UK is certainly possible, but first there needs to be a discussion as to a) what level is most appropriate for a sub-national government - especially in the very varied and highly populous England; and b) specifically what power those sub-national governments will have.

I think the first question is actually the trickier of the two.  I mean, would you have London and Everywhere Else?  I don't think England as a whole would work.  Too big, too varied. The North, London, The West, The South?

Going to be a hell of an interesting discussion when it really kicks off.

The truth is that for generations this sort of behaviour has typified the British attitude to going out. The object of an evening out seems to be to get as drunk as possible. Any evening that does not end in one staggering home with only a vague memory of the evening's activities is considered a failure. It would be hypocritical of me to deride this behaviour as I too used to engage in that kind of thinking in my twenties. I never did anything as stupid as the vodka bucket challenge, though.

Now in my late thirties my attitude to drinking and going out has changed. Don't get me wrong I still enjoy a drink and still get drunk occasionally but getting absolutely shitfaced is no longer my primary goal when I go out.

The question is, what do we as a country do about this? We can't keep raising the price of alcohol.

One last time: I don't actually search for a scapegoat but for the answer to the problem. And my answer would currently be, given our injuries and lack of appropriate players: drop Gerrard. 

In my opinion the defense is fine and the lack of defensive midfielder is causing them to mess up.  

The general consensus here is that Gerrard is still a brilliant player and that our defense is at fault for several reasons.

I agree with you if you say that maybe the defense needs more time to gel, which is true, but then having no protection from the midfield isn't ideal either.

No, it sets precedent. So to make a compelling case those that argue 16 years olds are too immature or not well informed enough to make decisions (a tad ironic considering the justifications being put forward and a fairly weak argument non the less) need to show why the precedent of the independence referendum should not apply to general elections. ""Mature enough"" for one and not the other, ""informed enough"" for a referendum but not for a general election. 

You can't have people drifting in and out of enfranchisement. 

&gt;Salmond tried gerrymandering and failed.

Firstly, there was no gerrymandering. Lib Dems, Labour and SNP all supported votes at 16 for the independence referendum. Secondly it didn't fail, they got the vote. 

Also, Ed Miliband has also been pushing for votes at 16 to extend to general elections.

The problem is ""the public"" only have their own experience to draw on, which inevitably gives them a blinkered view.  This isn't to argue that we should all defer to technocrats, but ""being a mum"" is not a suitable qualification on its own for deciding on national education policy.

As an example, Gove commissioned Ben Goldacre to propose how [evidence-based research](http://www.badscience.net/2013/03/heres-my-paper-on-evidence-and-teaching-for-the-education-minister/) could be brought into the teaching profession.

That's Guardian-favourite ""all about the evidence to an almost nauseating degree"" Dr Ben Goldacre.  You can guess how well Goldacre's proposals were received by the teaching profession...

Here's what Dominic ""Psycho"" Cummings said about Gove's approach to evidence-based policy (it's a bit wordy but that's how Cummings usually writes on his blog):

&gt; After reading the physicist Richard Feynman’s famous speech on education research as ‘cargo cult science’, I got Ben Goldacre into the DfE to do a report a) to spark a debate about evidence-based policy, and b) revamp the DfE’s analysis division. **All the people who write endlessly ‘Gove’s an ideologue who ignores evidence’ never mention or refer to this. It was attacked by many (inside and outside DfE) including the unions. Many are cross about it because the thought of randomised control trials proving that their pet theory is rubbish is not appealing.** (Many of the social science academics who write letters attacking Gove – often Marxist economists still in the pre-1989 jungle, ‘literary theorists’, and others from the lowest ranks of academia – are appalled at the idea of techniques from the hard sciences invading their domains and exposing their frauds. For them ‘cargo cult science’ is a lucrative business.)
&gt; 
&gt; **It is fashionable to say that we ‘ignored evidence’ but it is false. As Tim Oates, head of research for Cambridge Assessment said, ‘Michael Gove has been vilified for ignoring evidence, but I have never worked with a politician who listens to evidence as much as he does’.** When I arrived, the DfE did not even subscribe to either Science or Nature – the two most prestigious scientific journals. It took me six months of fighting but that changed. The idea that we dislike ‘evidence’ while the pure civil service or our opponents love it is a comical caricature. We often invited into DfE people who disagreed – often random bloggers or twitterers who had made interesting arguments or pointed out mistakes. In a large bureaucracy, it is vital to keep eyes on the grassroots as they almost always will give you warning of problems faster than official signals (which says a lot about official signals). Large scale RCTs of Sure Start or the Pupil Premium would be excellent. Who do you think oppose them? Not me – bring them on! I wish we had gone further on the Goldacre stuff but like everything else it was a victim of our limited bandwidth in the face of determined resistance. Only a huge restructuring of the DfE – inconceivable on any plausible current trajectory – would enable genuine evidence-led policy to become the norm. Lots of people internally would like it to happen but the obstacles are too high and the incentives won’t push things that way. But at least Goldacre was a start…",0,1411482065,null,0,false,0,ckq9tkk,t3_2h4fo9,t1_ckq9tkk,t1_ckq9cfe,null,1426862538,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

false,eyuplass,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"You can't argue that the government does not provide housing, disability benefit, free healthcare, and childcare allowance as part of the social contract. Your taxes ensure all of these things, they haven't gone away. You may disagree with the premise of people having to move for their social housing, but the social housing still exists.

I've had to move away from my home in part because the discrepancy between wages and living costs. I moved somewhere cheaper in the country where I could live better on the same wage. It's not as nice, friends and family are further away, but I am more financially comfortable. I don't have to worry about making ends meet each month because of rental and transport costs. I would love to live in London but I can't because I can't afford it. There are probably many thousands of people in this country who have to do this every year, especially young people. Why are people on benefits any different? If someone has a kid and is on benefits why are they any different than parents who aren't on benefits who have to leave their support networks due to housing costs?

Furthermore, we're using our taxes to subsidize companies who won't pay their workers a living wage. We're telling transport companies that it's OK to make commutes so expensive that people need to live centrally. We're telling landlords that it's acceptable to keep raising rents without maintaining property standards and the British taxpayer will foot the bill, even if people are forced to live in squalor for double or triple the price of a good home elsewhere. Central London needs labour and unskilled workers. These young mothers could potentially fill these roles. But these roles need to pay enough to support actually living in London, transport costs need to come down so that people can live in cheaper areas and commute affordably, rent rises need to be capped, speculative foreign buyers who buy property and leave them empty need to be banned or highly taxed. This isn't laissez faire economics, it's the safety net protecting its long term viability and holding people in power accountable for the problems they have created. It's about a fairer deal for people living in London.

There are a lot of socialist ideas that would make London a fairer city, but I don't think that this is one of them. The taxpayer shouldn't pay the costs of an inflated property market in a country that needs to be decentralized. If London is going to play the capitalist game, then let them lose money when people leave. Other cities will gain and London will be forced to act on these issues in order to stop the decline. These women will still get free housing and food elsewhere. They will still be able to use the NHS and get unemployment or disability benefit. Their kids will still get free education. Every other young person in this country has to make tough decisions like moving away or living with their parents because of the housing shortage. The whole situation is unfair but I don't see the argument as to why some should be exempt from this.",0,1411482775,null,0,1411484306,0,ckqa550,t3_2h7q8p,t1_ckqa550,t1_ckq8y41,null,1426862389,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

The fact that the SNP refuse to let it drop and insist on keeping animosity between Scots and the rest of the UK in the media with phrases like 'the Westminster gang' just sums up how bloody minded they are about this. They insist on arguing that they lost because Yes voters were tricked, which just makes Salmond look like an petulant child. Is it not possible that he lost because serious arguments were raised about the risks of independence and he just shrugged it off saying 'We're positive, they're negative,' which proves nothing other than the fact that you carefully structured the question to manufacture consent?

When the tough questions were asked he offered no serious answers. Just pathetic comments like invasion jokes as if every single card was in the SNP's favour. No comment about the impact on Scottish research by losing out on Westminster funding for Scottish universities. No critical debate on the accusations that he'd inflated the oil revenue figures. No serious outlines and timetables about when he plans to take Scotland to the EU. No mention of interim free trade deals. No comments about a currency Plan B. The whole thing was a joke and he's riding the coattails of populist nationalism all the way to a reputation as an elder statesman and it is sickening to watch. Just glib remarks and fluff soundbites, and now he won't stop banging on about 1.6M votes and trickery and dragging this on with a rhetoric designed to do nothing more than whip people up into an anger. ""Scotland might declare independence anyway""? Yeah, mate. Enjoy the civil war when you try that one when *THE MAJORITY OF THE SCOTTISH ELECTORATE HAS EXPLICITLY JUST SAID THEY DON'T WANT THAT*.

If he can stand up and blast the doors off with a 100% ironclad rebuttal to Gordon Brown's speech I might be convinced to take him seriously, but until that time he can shut the fuck up and accept that he had a referendum and he lost. What a tool.

Now I need to stop reposting his ""fascinating!"" links on Reddit before it looks like I'm getting paid for doing this...

Seriously though, if this technology was displayed on-platform, it'd be ace (and probably give at least some assistance to smoothing peak overcrowding, since different areas of longer trains seem to accumulate significant variation in how busy they are, in my experience).  
Some cynics on Twitter pointed out that these displays may serve to highlight how empty dedicated 1st Class carriages usually are. If that increases public demand to reallocate some space, so be it - as a counterpoint, the TOC could even see it as cheeky marketing for more expensive 1st tickets. Maybe the daily temptation of a display saying ""look, these coaches are *far* less busy"" would encourage a few fence-sitters with disposable income to make the jump to 1st? 

I can't wait to use this system as a passenger, I hope it becomes widely adopted. Everything from the Underground to long-distance intercity services stands to benefit in my opinion, and from a cost/engineering standpoint it's extremely simple to implement. I presume the weight sensors are already fitted to all modern rolling stock anyway?

Final thought - As someone who takes my bike on trains quite a bit, it'd also be really handy to see where the bike spaces are in advance and how busy they are. (Getting on an unfamiliar service/at a new station usually seems to come down to ""stand in the middle, scour for a bike symbol on each vestibule door as it rushes past, be prepared to RUN down the platform with bike!"" for me at the moment - dangerous, hardly ideal, and there isn't always a dispatcher to hand to ask)  
Combine this display technology with something showing where bike/wheelchair areas are, display it on platform before the service arrives, and you're onto a real winner. ",0,1411483800,null,0,1411484001,0,ckqaluv,t3_2h8bsc,t1_ckqaluv,t3_2h8bsc,null,1426862171,3,false,uktrains,t5_2z9xu,3

Problem with this: Firstly, the idea of informed consent is laughable, most people can't be expected to fully understand half of the issues they vote on, age regardless. Secondly, lets not forget 16 is not to young or too irresponsible to be in the Army, RAF or RN and potentially die for a country you have no voting franchise in (though its rare as fuck for them to actually be deployed unless shit his the fan hard, philosophical point and all that).

2) They don't pay taxes.

Problem: Well everyone pays VAT and plenty of 16, 17 year olds work (indeed we should be focusing on getting more people into appreteships of quality at this age, but thats another thing). So meh? It's no more derisive to suggest that 16/17 should not vote because most of them won't be paying capital gains taxes, than to suggest Pensioners who arn't funding their pensions shouldn't vote on pension policies.

**Skin Type &amp; Concerns**: I have oily acne prone skin, so this product promised to be right up my alley.

**Your opinion**: I honestly would have never looked at the product twice if I hadn't got the sample. The full size packaging looks like mouthwash and feels bulky to carry. But, I'm glad I tried it! I used it as the second step in OCM when I was away from home and I loved it! Not a heavy smell and didn't leave my skin feeling stripped and tight. 

**Will you purchase it full price?**: I'm waiting on a sale in Boots, but absolutely!

**Name of product**: Cleanance K

**Product claims**: Cleanance K helps reduce spots, blackheads and blemishes.  

**Skin Type &amp; Concerns**: I have oily acne prone skin, so this product promised to be right up my alley.

**Your opinion**: I had already bought the full size, but put it away because I felt that it was a bit heavy. I went back to using it again for about a week and actually I don't hate it. I can't use it every day because the combination is strong for my skin. But after the week my skin was noticeably brighter and my active acne reduced *significantly*.

Lopes has been at the club for 5 years, captained all the youth teams and *is our player*, not signed to another club with a 4 year contract he signed a month ago. Lille's youth academy director just said he is a better prospect at 18 than Hazard was.

Time will tell I guess, but the club apparently have someone in Lille every week to check up and monitor Rony's progress. Thats unusal, most players get a weekly phone call. Clearly we are very interested in making him our first successful academy graduate.

As someone who's currently sitting at my desk at my workplace in Leicester, I think the point is that they can't do the ""same work, selling the same product, for the same price"" elsewhere. I'm sure companies would love to save money by employing people where cost-of-living is cheaper.

There's a certain amount of ""network effect"" since it's often cheaper to have businesses close to each other (if they often work together) than it is to pay the travel costs between them. That also works for competitors; a potential customer (as in another business, not a consumer) is more likely to visit a company that's near to them and less likely to want to visit multiple different cities before making a decision, so it's beneficial to have similar businesses close together.

Most business in London isn't retail or manufacturing (at least not directly); it's services, corporate headquarters, finance, etc.

That being said, there does seem to be the beginnings of a change. While population growth isn't the best measure of economic growth, London's is slowing, while, for instance Manchester has grown by 20% over the last 10 years (and has room to continue; it's still only about 33% of the size it was 100 years ago).",0,1411486964,null,0,false,0,ckqc54j,t3_2h823g,t1_ckqc54j,t1_ckqapkt,null,1426861455,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

""If you buy them online then you need a print out and the card it was bought with, for some train companies the print out is enough. Also don't buy tickets from thetrainline.com as EU charge booking fees. If you're buying them online for pick up at a machine you have to show your credit card.

They couldn't. So the first thing they'd do if elected would be to use their majority in the UK parliament to get rid of the English parliament altogether, and revert back to the present system (except with more Scottish devolution).

false,TerrordactylYOU,null,null,"Things are touched on already, but here's a more complete answer:

Points:

1) Evidence of tartan in the sense of just making fabric that looks like that is very, very old. It's hard to lay claim to for anyone. It may have been a Celtic thing, that's generally where you see it.

2) The earliest evidence of the kilt is from the late 16th century, I want to say 1580s or 1590s. It's a tiny 1x1 depiction in the corner of a frontispiece in a book. It takes a while before more depictions start to show up, but there's not really a good reason to assume kilts weren't around before that. There are also early descriptions of things like ""varied cloaks belted about their loins"" which sounds a lot like a kilt to me.

3) While we know the kilt was around starting in the late 16th century and most likely earlier (although truibhas, or nothing below your waist was more common if what few depictions we have are a good indication) there's no indication of ""Clan Tartans"" until the ""Celtic Revival"" in the 19th century. (You could maybe make an argument for the Jacobite rebellions, that's not my strong point in history so I'm not 100% there.) During that time the two brothers referenced by someone else, the ""Sobieski Stuarts"" (John Sobieski Stuart and Charles Edward Stuart were names used by John Carter Allen and Charles Manning Allen) wrote The Costume of the Clans which included an index of Clan Tartans. There's no way to tell if they just made this all up, or made an honest attempt to collect data. At this point being ""Irish in public"" i.e. dressing in Gaelic clothing (the Scottish and the Irish were considered more or less the same people) had been illegal for centuries so nobody knew what any of it looked like anymore. It is entirely possible that the brothers went around the highlands asking old people and got things like ""well my uncle painted this thing on the attic when he was a boy"" and matched single pieces of evidence to geographic regions to come up with what they actually thought was a system of Clan Tartans.

Analysis:
Does this make Clan Tartans English? No. Cultural constructs don't need time continuity to be more real just because it was Englishmen that made the index doesn't make it English, because the English didn't start wearing them. The Scots started wearing them, therefor it's Scottish. Similarly, just because your Clan has been wearing the same Tartan for 200 years and not 500 years doesn't make it not your Clan Tartan. Your Clan adopted it. That's what matters. Really all that matters is your Chief said wear it as a symbol of the Clan. If Himself says we're all wearing rubber ducky print flannel now that's weird but so be it.

tl;dr: Tartan is crazy old and could be Celtic, the kilt is Scottish but probably not that big a deal historically, the Sobieski Stuarts were English brothers who made a book of Tartans that is dubious but not necessarily malicious, and yes, kilts are Scottish.",0,1411488804,null,0,false,0,ckqd2hq,t3_2h5y0u,t1_ckqd2hq,t3_2h5y0u,null,1426861023,3,false,ScottishHistory,t5_2u68p,3

It's frustrating how many people dont understand that there is a difference between the Syrian opposition and ISIS so I'm glad you pointed this out.  While I am sure the Free Syrian Army is not perfect they at least represent a faction that is fighting against ISIS and Bashar al-Assad's regime.  While it's certainly possible we supported some of the smaller groups that went on to join ISIS we never directly supported them (seeing as they were a direct offshoot from Al Qaeda in Iraq).

&gt;Or, in short, if we are blaming anyone for ISIS it should be those people who decided to let a civil war fester for a couple of years thinking there would be no down side to it.

This is exactly right.  The Syrians were begging for our intervention and we failed to act because of the political issues caused by the Iraq war.  One of the big reasons for the rapid growth of ISIS is that when we left Syria to become a wasteland many Syrians turned to those who did come to help them against al-Assad's regime.  It allowed ISIS to claim a huge amount of credibility among Jihadist groups when they became a major part of the Syrian opposition which gave them a huge recruitment boost.

So my decision would not be different if my first Doctor was somebody else, Tenth is just that amazing! 

Now the reasons: What I admire about Ten is his unending admiration of humans, and their perseverance, their passion for life. 

I really love how he respects every lifeform he meets, and how he fights to the end to save them all, even of he knows it's impossible. Many people like that Twelfth doesn't give a damn about those he doesn't think he can save, but that is just wrong. Tenth more than any other Doctor before or after him (with the exception of Ninth) felt every death on his conscience.I think that even if the Doctor can't save them all, he should try to remember them all, not forget them like Eleventh. 

Finally, I really like Tenth's childlike enthusiasm for every new adventure that hides behind the corner, for every wonder in the universe the TARDIS takes him to. 

And of course, David Tennant.

I'm not an expert on fish biology, so feel free to correct me.

Fish need Dissolved Oxygen in the water to breath (via the gills). In the event of low dissolved oxygen levels (resultant from a pollutant, or sustained warm temperatures, with very little rain), the fish find themselves struggling for air. 

The fish will then go to the surface of the water, where there will be more oxygen (natural exchange between air and water).

If a team we are playing has defended particularly well against formation A, but not so well against formation B, we may throw formation B at them. If a team we're playing has a strong midfield presence or quality attackers, we may move an extra man into the midfield or play two defensive mids to compensate... It really depends on the matchup that week. That said, managers (particularly stubborn ones like BFS) tend to stick with what has worked for them in the past. Sam has tended to prefer a 4-5-1/4-3-3, where the wings are midfielders on defense but push forward to a front line position while attacking. We've seen him experiment with a 3-5-2 and a 4-4-2 in the past, though, and once he even played a 4-6-0 with Ravel as a False 9. It really depends on the matchup and who is in form. I would expect more 2 striker fronts for us this season, with how well Valencia and Sakho have looked together.

Time changed happen for a variety of reasons. Expect most weekend games to start between 10am and 1pm (East Coast time), and most weekday games to start between noon and 3pm (East Coast Time).

Contract terms are usually undisclosed, but the length of the deal is generally announced on the website whenever they make the official announcement of the signing.

One: Grandfather figure who has the answers.. sort of. He's got an almost mischievous interest the universe and curiosity that often gets him into trouble.  
Two: A goofier, slightly younger version of one.   
Three: A elder mix between a hippie and James Bond. He was the first Doctor to get into fights, which is cool. But for me, that was the only thing cool about him.   
Four: Here we go. Four is awesome. He is the basis for the Doctor's personas in the reboot and he is the cosmic wanderer, seeing how incredible the universe is and having fun with it. He was cynical when he needed to be but he always protected the innocent and embodied the true Doctor.     
    
Skip ahead to...  
Eight: Cool younger Doctor... never had time to shine except in a crappy movie.  
Nine: Bitter, just out of the Time War. After seeing his race burn (sort of), he feels compelled to protect humanity, but sort of resents them for it.   
Ten: He has regret for his actions, considers himself to be alone, but also sees the wonder in the universe and truly loves all of it. Ten could face any foe or best any trial with a sly smile. His downfall was that he saw how amazing he was and developed a god complex (Time Lord Triumphant). Still, this great hero is my favorite. He never abandoned his ethics nor did he ever falter in saving even the smallest life.    
Eleven: After being alone for so long, this Doctor just wanted to be loved and have friends. He was introduced into a fairy tale world of protecting a little girl from a monster. He never left the fairy tale world. This was the disney Doctor for me. I like him, but he's a little too kooky for the sake of being kooky. He was a kid trying to be cool, but not really knowing what cool is.   
Twelve: Doesn't care if he's liked. Doesn't care what others think. He has a mission and he is devoted to it. He wants knowledge and happens to protect others as he goes. He is done with playing around and done pandering to lower life forms. He just want everyone to shutity up so he can do the real thinking.

Conversely there are also plenty of people who put all of that off until after university, well after the age of 18. You will be in for a rude awakening if you think that your peers will all undergo some vast political epiphany over the next couple of years, plenty of adults remain *completely* clueless about such issues, are immature, or even just plain stupid, but that isn't the criteria by which we decide who is allowed to vote. When you look at the legal rights and responsibilities of a 16 year old, denying them the most basic form of political representation does not seem logical.

A 16 year old *does* have the capacity to be politically informed and aware. My political opinions have definitely changed since I was 16 (23 now), but not so drastically that looking back I don't feel like my 16 year old self was not capable of making a reasonably informed decision.

&gt; Major employers include the Honda of the UK Manufacturing car production plant at an old Vickers factory site on the former World War II RAF base of South Marston, BMW/Mini (formerly Pressed Steel Fisher) in Stratton, mobile phone companys Alcatel Lucent and Nokia Solutions and Networks, Dolby Labs, international engineering consultancy firm Halcrow Group Limited and retailer W H Smith's distribution centre and headquarters. The electronics company, Intel, has its European head office on the south side of the town. Insurance and financial services companies such as Nationwide Building Society and Zurich Financial Services, the energy company RWE (which includes the well known retail brand npower), the fuel card and fleet management company Arval, pharmaceutical companies such as Canada's Patheon and the United States-based Catalent Pharma Solutions and French Medical Supplies Manufacturer Vygon (UK) Ltd have their UK divisions headquartered in the town. Swindon also has the registered Head Office of the National Trust.

&gt; Swindon businesses include banks such as Barclays, Natwest, HSBC, Lloyds TSB and Handelsbanken, all having a commercial presence. The town also has a number of professional legal firms such as Clarke Holt, Thring Townsend, Lemon &amp; Co, together with accountants such as Dennis &amp; Turnbull and RSM Tenon and iSys Intelligent Systems.

&gt; Other employers include all of the national Research Councils, the British Computer Society, Alcatel-Lucent, eCommerce provider Shopatron, divisions of Tyco International, consumer goods supplier Reckitt Benckiser and a branch of Becton Dickinson.

**TL;DR:** Mainly car manufacturing and some national/European HQs along with a healthy presence from the tech, financial, legal and pharmaceutical industries among others.

As for why all that is in Swindon:

&gt; At the junction of two Roman roads, the town has developed over the centuries, with the assistance of the GWR and the canals, into a transport hub.

Places with good transport connections (obvious example being London and the M4 Corridor, which Swindon, incidentally, is in) tend to attract a lot of businesses due to the large employee pool that can commute in from the surrounding area.",0,1411492960,null,0,false,0,ckqf93s,t3_2h823g,t1_ckqf93s,t1_ckqd2sx,null,1426859947,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

The problem is, it has to be **very** reliable, or it is potentially dangerous, *oh, that can't be another plane, my TCAS hasn't shown it* type scenarios.  The thing is there are actually LARS covering that area, however I don't know if they were in operation for traffic service, or just offering basic.  Additionally the pilots might not have decided to opt for any service at all.

One of the biggest problems the GA community has is that of rising costs and NIMBY types, fuel prices makes it a struggle, one myself I can not afford at the moment.  This is making it a lot harder for younger people to take it up and no doubt will lead to more shortages of pilots.

Anything that adds to the cost, is often complained about.  Some of these are also maintained just to the minimum legal requirements, I rented a plane once that the COM panel failed on.  Meaning I had no way of transmitting.  (I've subsequently taken to carrying a backup handled two way transceiver)   This wasn't an issue at all as far as safety for a normal operation went, but it did make me return the plane rather swiftly and exchange my views with the owner about his idea of service minimas.

Myself I'm in favour of these modern things, but a lot of the old timers are not, many detest GPS, they see it as another thing to fail (fair enough, I've normally got two tablets and a phone as 'backup').  They also fear that it makes people lazy, *Who would trust that blinking box over a mk1 eye ball* they say.  TCAS systems don't work very well if they don't have most people using them.  Additionally, to make them really useful they have to be incredibly intelligent, if you get frequent false alarms, you won't use it.  There is for instance a lot of congestion around the M25, I kid you not.  It's a brilliant landmark, because it ensures you are not inside the giant class-a restricted space around London, for Heathrow, whilst not impacting the space reserved for Luton and Stansted.  So you just follow the road!  Issue is that lots of other people have this idea too.  I remember once I only saw someone about 5 seconds before he passed me, that was shocking to say the least, but two tiny little craft moving at about ~250mph relative speeds, there's a reason why they demand good vision.  A simplistic TCAS system will just go BLERRRRRRRP the whole time you are in such an area, so being a stupid meat bag, you will ignore it every time.

Thing is, every GA incident gets a mention in the press, but car incidents do not.  GA is very, very safe by comparison, even more so to *innocent bystanders* that you shouldn't need to worry, CAA / EASA ensure that the pilots are worrying enough for you.  Oh and if you moved next door to an aerodrome, more so one that's been around for 80 years, and you complain about safety and the like, fuck you.  There was a very sad incident a few years back at Perranporth where someone committed suicide, he had attempted it in his car, but the doctors hadn't notified the authorities about his attempt, so his license was not pulled, he flew into the hard granite cliff, killing himself.  So yeah, if you bought a house near by, or built one, and now complain about a former spitfire base having aircraft that are much quieter now, fuck you. too",0,1411493021,null,0,false,0,ckqfab1,t3_2h7ruf,t1_ckqfab1,t1_ckqed5u,null,1426859931,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I understand the point of financial development being in the financial district but not all work need be done there.

I'm an engineer, and I've looked at work all over the UK. I've seen a lot of jobs advertised at ridiculously low wages in out-of-the-way areas. I've heard the argument plenty of times that it's because ""it's cheaper to live out there"" but there's a point where it's not worthwhile at a diminished wage.

Also take in to account that UK wages have stagnated for years. I used to work in the UK in 1997, and the hourly wage I earned as a contractor is almost the same, pound for pound, as I can get today. I think it's a problem.

I really do think that companies outside of London are paying *below* what they could be paying.

As a player and coach, I really focus on the technical abilities of players when I watch games. I have said this before and I will say it again, Willian is sooo right footed. The only piece of skill I have ever seen from him is moving the ball with the outside of his right foot. Even on multiple occasions against City he tried doing it and it was easily defended. I'm sure opposing players know this by now too. Guard Willian's right and he goes nowhere. He constantly turns the ball over making easy passes going forward, and his through balls rarely end up on a teammates feet. Even the corners he took last year with his right foot were garbage, so I don't think he's of much value on the wings for crosses.

 That being said, his work rate is unparalleled and his defensive skill and ability to read the game is superb. I am also pretty certain he's one of the fastest guys on the team. He has strength and can win balls in the air.

false,7zark77,eng-GreaterLondon,London,"It used to be the working class - with the emphasis on 'working' who lived in social housing. These days, it's the non-working class - the underclass, if you will. That's why there is resentment among the old working class towards this new class of people who don't work - they're getting something for nothing. 

However, it was homelessness and housing benefit legislation introduced by Labour in the 1970s which began to change who social housing was for - now you could have a council home without having a job. The cycle of dependency had begun. 

Also: If you read the academic literature concerning right to buy, nobody is convinced that Thatcher 'bought votes' - the evidence just doesn't stack up. Rather, she was rewarding people who had already bought into Tory aspiration that you're in control of your destiny, and don't need the state to back you up.

It's also worth noting that, yes, we lost a lot of housing stock under Thatcher, but Labour did nothing about it either. They didn't end right to buy, and they didn't build new council homes - instead they spent hundreds of millions of pounds giving old council homes double glazing, a new kitchen and a lick of paint. 

I also think it's too easy to blame everything on 'bad education' - there are lots of people who went to not very good comprehensives who have done alright in life (I include myself in this group). 

I think the real con is with the people who have been encouraged to spend £000s on getting a GOOD education - the  kids who did everything they were told and were sold the idea that university is the key to a successful life. However, they've discovered that going to a lower tier university and getting a degree in a worthless subject does nothing much for your career prospects.

There is so called LARS, Low Altitude Radar Service which [you can see just ends below the incident site here (page 5)](http://flyontrack.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/EGLFLARS.pdf)

This LARS when operating, provides different levels of service, basic for instance just tells you *piss off out of Lutons airspace* in big boy words, a traffic advisory service will be all *XX traffic 270 5 miles* but they are not responsible for your separation (this is the nice way of saying not slamming into another plane, seperation!). 

A light aircraft needs nothing for certain kinds of airspace, this is where some of the really old stuff I've flown is fun, the open cockpit.  Not even a radio.  An up to date map is a legal requirement, as are certain instruments, speed, direction and so forth.

How would this collision system work?  Active Radar?  Damned expensive that, also not very reliable.  Detecting reliably and accurately what is a collision course is not simple, military are quite good at doing this, they spend a lot of money, have multiple sites, all so they can get an accurate fix.

Newer planes have a better transponder, the older ones work by making an obvious PONG to the radar sweeps PING, that PONG includes a number to identify it, later ones include altitude too.  The newest fancy ones include GPS co-ordinates, heading (direction) and speed.  Receiving this info, plotting it on a map, and working out who intersects with you is easy.  But it's a chicken and egg thing, if no one else has it, why would you?

&gt;

&gt;__Jamie Oliver Troughton__ (born 2 March 1979) was an [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) [cricketer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket). He was mainly an attack-minded left-handed batsman but also an occasional slow left-arm orthodox bowler. He played for and captained the county side [Warwickshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club) and has played for the [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) [One Day International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) team.

&gt;He has played six One-day Internationals for England at time of writing, scoring 36 runs at an average of nine. He is a hard-hitting batsman with a good range of shots. He averages a respectable 40 plus in the four day county game.

&gt;He won the [NBC Denis Compton Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Denis_Compton_Award) in 2002. He is the son of noted Shakespearean actor [David Troughton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Troughton). His grandfather, [Patrick Troughton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Troughton), starred as the [Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)) in the science fiction series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)* in the 1960s. He is also the younger brother of *[Robin Hood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood_(2006_TV_series\))* actor [Sam Troughton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Troughton) and the cousin of actor [Harry Melling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Melling_(actor\)) from the Harry Potter films.

&gt;He was named Warwickshire captain for the 2011 season in November 2010.  Troughton captained Warwickshire to 2nd place in the 2011 County Championship, losing out on the title on the last day of the final game, with Lancashire finishing as champions. However, this disappointment was short-lived as Troughton oversaw Warwickshire win the County Championship a year later.

&gt;On 19 August 2014 Troughton announced that he would be retiring, with immediate effect, because of a back injury.

&gt;Underground power cables are still at least five times more expensive than overhead lines, new research says — despite advances in technology.

&gt;Burying underground cables (UGC) is the second-cheapest way of transmitting power but **lifetime costs are £10.2m–£24.1m per km, compared to £2.2m–£4.2m per km for overhead lines** (OHL), the government-commissioned report found.

[Source](http://www.theengineer.co.uk/energy/news/report-says-that-underground-cables-are-still-expensive/1011587.article)

Another article lists factors including construction (4-14x as costly), maintenance costs, repairs (""*cost of finding [the damaged section's] location, trenching, cable splicing, and re-embedment is sometimes five to 10 times more expensive than repairing a fault in an overhead line where the conductors are visible, readily accessible and easier to repair.*"") and modifications all add to the price.

[Source](http://www.elp.com/articles/powergrid_international/print/volume-18/issue-2/features/underground-vs-overhead-power-line-installation-cost-comparison-.html)

[A Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergrounding#Comparison) of the differences highlights more issues.

Although some people [dispute these claims](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jan/31/burying-electric-pylons-cheaper-government) but even they say it would *only* be 4-6x as expensive than overground pylons.

E: There is a lot of politicised economics in there too.

I’m not saying that the issue of younger people voting has a simple and straightforward ‘line in the sand’. I appreciate that there are many subjects that do affect young people, such as education and university fees.

I also agree with you that political knowledge is not some enlightenment that you wake up to on your 18th birthday. However there is a fundamental difference between knowledge and experience. If I were an adult I can’t say i’d feel comfortable knowing that a group of people who aren’t affected by a huge number of the issues debated in politics are able to vote on and consequently help determine the outcome of how these issues are approached.

I have tons of friends who have a thorough understanding and appreciation of politics, and i’m not trying to diminish their awareness just as i’m not trying to downplay yours, I have tremendous respect for any fellow young person who is interested in politics. However I just don’t believe that the majority of those my age have the real-life experience that constitutes a fair vote, however knowledgeable they are in theory, most would still lack understanding of the consequence of their actions until they’ve lived the consequences practically.

First: CBR400RR- look good (reason I bought it) mental 18k redline, sounded fantastic. However, the gearbox was fucked and then I crashed it. It also wasnt very comfortable, quite slow. (had to paddle to get it off the line without stalling because 1st was crazy tall) The restriction meant that it got to 10k rpm, kept going but didn't accelerate any harder. 

Second: SV650N- brilliant bike. Took to the restriction really well, sounded fantastic. (full yoshi system) off the line it felt unrestricted, top end was a bit disappointing, but not as bad as the CBR above. Lots of character. Comfortable, and fairly forgiving. My recommendation for anyone on an A2.

Third: F8 Hornet 600- current ride, as I understand it you can't have one on an A2, although I think you can with the old carbie model. Restrictor may have fallen out. Ducking quick, comfortable, easier to ride than the SV. Bit boring. 

As a side note, all of these were on 33hp, so whilst not exactly the same as the new A2 it gives you a half decent idea.

false,Dardanator,null,null,"&gt; There's nothing fundamentally different about the working class in those two cities and the working class in Portlaoise so why aren't Labour campaigning for Ireland to rejoin the UK?

Aside from that being something the Irish would hate them for even suggesting, getting ireland to rejoin the uk has the same problem as independence: it's spending time and resources implementing a major political change to help people rather than helping them within the current framework at a much lower cost. I don't see a problem with the SNP being a Scotland-only party, frankly I wish the other parties would decentralise, leading to a number of regional parties within the uk. But it's never made sense to me to push for independence with the promise of a better society afterward rather than working with others within the current framework to improve the situation for the people of scotland and the rest of the uk. Regardless of your views on the pros and cons of independence, I don't think anyone would disagree that it's a significant step involving a considerable effort and investment of resources. Add to that the uncertainty and risks that come with that - even the most optimistic of yes voters on here seemed to agree that things would be difficult for Scotland to start with, nobody expected the benefits to come in a short time frame. Why go through all of that to build a better society instead of seeking to fix the one you're currently in?

Throughout the campaign the answer to that seemed to be that people had no hope that things could be changed in the current situation, with independence being the only thing that gave them hope that reform could be achieved. On this subreddit I noticed a number of people saying that they would be content to remain in the union but voted yes because they wanted political changes and didn't feel there was any chance of obtaining them within the union. However I think the appetite for change is very strong all over the country, just look at the recent european elections where all of England and Wales (except London) delivered a strong rejection of the mainstream political parties, with UKIP and the Greens making gains. In the independence debate that was framed as a lurch toward the right in England and Wales and used an example of increasing divergence between scotland and the rest of the country, but I don't agree with that. I think it shows that the rest of the country are thinking exactly the same as Scots: that they're tired of politics as it is. UKIP topped the poll in Wales, and being Welsh myself I find the idea of any lurch to the right there laughable, it's still a place where people tend to be left wing (it used to be that labour were the eurosceptic party so concern about the eu persists among many people on the left). People from all over the political spectrum voted for UKIP, knowing full well they didn't agree with many of their policies, because they didn't want to vote for any of the main three.

One thing that this referendum has shown is just what the public are capable of when they take up a political cause and campaign actively for it, something that hasn't been done on this scale in a long time (I can't think of any instances of the public bringing about political reform since the suffragette movement, but perhaps someone who knows more about history can correct me). If all of that effort had been invested into improving and reforming the UK, getting people from the rest of the country involved too, we could very well have started seeing a number of benefits by now; instead people spent years campaigning for the referendum, where we wouldn't start seeing political changes until some time after the referendum regardless of the outcome. But what's done is done, and hopefully things will change now.",0,1411496485,null,0,1411496674,0,ckqh5hl,t3_2h4sob,t1_ckqh5hl,t1_ckpq9av,null,1426859043,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Railyard: Prices are steep for what you get, en-suites were nice, room was big enough and newish at the time (4 years or so ago) same goes for the kitchens, no complaints really. Customer service was always okay, if you ever forgot your fob often those opening it again acted as though you'd killed their first born. Bar that though it was nice enough.


Agnes Jones House: Now, this is probably my worst uni experience in terms of living quality. The rooms felt pretty grim like they hadn't been altered since the building was founded. Old carpets, old curtains, horrible wood features in all the rooms. The kitchen itself seemed okay however, we had mice. Now, we reported these mice and had traps left out that seemingly did nothing so that wasn't a pleasant experience at all. Eventually these mice seemed to have enough themselves and just up and left, traps left intact but the mice had vanished.

Capital Gate: This place was essentially the same as the Rail Yard, just felt a few years more dated.

I'm not sure where you're coming from but I know at least the Rail Yard/Capital Gate had flats that you could take a look around, if you're not coming from too far out it might be worth a look.

Best friends and/or close family members (at least, in my family anyways) can insult each other and it not be taken seriously (at least, *too* seriously). The Doctor may be taking it a little to far, but from what I've seen, Clara looks offended, but not hurt emotionally. My best friend and I do it all the time, and any time there's a get together or a birthday party with my family, we're either taking about something nerdy or insulting each other, and in both of those situations the person getting ""insulted"" looks offended, but never truly hurt.

I was about 7 years old and my dad bought me a premier league sticker book along with 10 packs of stickers. The obsession to complete the Liverpool page took over my life and I would spend whatever money I had on these sticker packets. ""Mum can I go to the shop for you? Mum can I hoover the house?"" - anything to get enough money for these stickers.

Me and my dad would bond massively over this sticker book. He would save up his dinner money in work to make sure he bought me 5 packets of stickers every Friday on his way home, or his friend would give him stickers for me if his son had duplicates. We'd put all the stickers in together - a real father/son moment and it's still one of my fondest childhood memories.

Finally, I had almost completed the Liverpool page. It was pristine and beautiful. Apart from fucking Patrik Berger. For months and months we bought packs in hopes of Patrik Berger appearing - I remember my dad went on a training course for a week and came back with 50 packs of stickers as a present. We sat there excitedly opening them one by one - like FIFA packs, in hopes of getting our TOTS Messi or Ronaldo. But nothing.

This was before the times of the internet where you could just Ebay search. It killed me. Nearly being reduced to tears every pack because I just couldn't fill this page (I wasn't a bratty kid or anything, this sticker book was generally the only thing I thought of and cared for).

I had so many duplicate stickers that people would trade me constantly. And then one day. One fucking horrific day, I saw it. The Patrik Berger card was firmly placed between my best friend's brother's hands. I begged and pleaded, offered him every single card I owned but he refused to budge.

For months I asked him to swap. Would continue buying packs in hopes of Berger appearing or maybe getting a card he wanted to trade, but nothing. Until one day, I got a David Seaman card that he needed to finish his Arsenal page and he agreed to swap.

I remember rushing to the school office to ring home and alert my dad that I had done it. (I generally thought he would be proud of me..) My mum told me he was in work but she'd call and let him know. The rest of the day was just the best day ever.

Until, a guy who had been tormenting me over the sticker book stole the card and ripped it up in front of my eyes. I don't think I have ever cried so much in my life, the heartache was worse than when I got dumped by my first love. The tears stung, my heart blackened and most importantly I had to face my dads disappointment (or so I thought yadda yadda.)

I picked up the remaining pieces of the card and left school. I walked into the living room and my dad instantly had the sticker book on the floor ready to place this final piece together until he saw the mess that was his sons face. After explaining what happened, I remember us sitting there sticking the remaining pieces of the Patrik Berger sticker into the book and it not being enough.

I went into my shell for weeks, my little heart was crushed. I wasn't eating or sleeping, I felt like the biggest disappointment. My dad would continue buying packs and opening them when I refused to take part.

The first season I watched as it aired was his second season that began with Remembrance of the Daleks. That first episode ends with the Doctor trapped in a locked room with an advancing dalek. I remembered that clearly for so long. Even after Doctor Who went off air, and I'd watched reruns of the older doctors, say ""Doctor Who"" and I'd instantly think of that scene, the scene with Ace trapped in a casket of water in 'Battlefield', and (bizzarely) the Kandyman advancing on the Doctor in 'Happiness Patrol'. Those three scenes stayed with me for whatever reason, so even though I love the new series, and honestly believe it is better than the original run, and even though from a more detached viewpoint I could argue Eleven was the best doctor, for me, The Doctor and Ace are what I think of when anyone says Doctor Who.

Considering it's British culture not to cover ones face in daily life - where's concession for *our* way of life? 

Irrespective of the obvious security issues of allowing groups of people to start completely covering their faces in a time we're apparently in heightened terror alert stages - and the inevitable backlash against any store owner, company etc. who insists that such face covering garments be removed for security purposes on their private property... 

...it's also clearly at odds with British culture and way of life - and we are still in Britain here. It's not over-stifling to expect certain concessions from people of other cultures when they choose to live in this country.

Flip it on its head and consider the kind of reception you would get if you (as a hypothetical white British woman) attempted to do any variety of things in the countries these cultures originate from. Consider the rude reaction you would experience. 

We bend over backwards to be open to other cultures. It's naive to think that every aspect of British culture and other cultures will easily mesh though - this is one such example of that.

Personally I have no issue what anybody wears in the privacy of their own home. But I have a big issue with people covering their face (including holding a hoodie tightly over the face or wearing a balaclava) in public for security reasons.

&gt; So people shouldn't be allowed to express their cultural heritage/tradition in Britain if it doesn't comply to stereotypical ""British culture""

Sorry, you misinterpreted; I was responding to your cries about culture - and I responded discussing ""British culture"".

Any non-British can display their culture through dress or action so long as it does not infringe upon others' rights. Such as the right not to feel afraid (i.e. ""assault""). The right to be able to identify people in public.

Obviously wearing a hair covering does not infringe upon others' rights. But covering one's face is a more extreme infringement of others' right to security - and not having to fear an unidentifiable person.

If you ignore Muslim culture for one moment - and consider the reaction of a group of males wearing balaclavas walking into a convenience store - how do you think ""British"" would react? Let me tell you - they would be afraid.

Nothing changes if you ""suppose"" the person behind the mask is a ""Muslim woman"". The fear is still there. Not least because nobody can determine the sex of the mask wearer - nor the religion - or the motivation behind the wearer.

Islamism as an ideology is less than one hundred years old. Mawdudi wrote about the Islamic State in the 1930s, he was inspired by the Russian revolution and the idea that a political movement  (communism) could take down the mighty Russian empire was intoxicating for mawdudi. The justification for his Islamic state came not from the Koran and the Hadith's but from Georg Hegel's philosophy of history and Marx/Lenin's vanguardism. 

Mawdudi used to criticise Muslim scholars for being stuck in the past, for ignoring social and political movements emanating from the west so he plagiarised his ideas from western political ideologues and philosophers.

Islamism isn't Islam, islamism is a political movement. As a political movement it's rooted in the early twentieth century and only offers a backward and regressive future for islam in the modern world. I'm sure living in a repressive state ruled by totalitarian religious purists (the kind that think no Muslim is as good a Muslim as they are, for they are the vanguard, the only real muslims) imposing a completely made up and brutal version of sharia holds no appeal whatsoever to most Muslims, the vast majority of whom are decent people who live normal, peaceful, law abiding lives.

false,das-katerer,colin-baker,Colin Baker,"Seven was my first, but Big Finish Six is *my* Doctor. He's loud and abrasive, he's an egotistical twit, and he also knows that if he ever stops yelling someone might notice how vulnerable and broken he is. He tries so hard to be the man he thinks he needs to be, the man everyone expects him to be, and he keeps getting it wrong. Down to the LOOK AT ME AND HOW MUCH FUN I AM HAVING WOW RAINBOWS EXCITEMENT AND WHIMSY outfit. And then sometimes he just...cracks. Colin Baker sells Six's quiet breakdowns so well. 

I really like the 5-6-7 transitions, and especially Six in the middle - he got himself killed because he was nice and he gave a damn, so now he's a jerk, but things keep happening at him and it's not like you can just shout the universe into order so he turns into the master manipulator who does his best to know what his emotions will be well in advance so nothing can hurt him. I couldn't say whether I'd be a diehard Six fan if I hadn't started with Seven, but the contrast does help define him.

The Doctor is never a character I'd ever really want to be, or ever want to really know, but Six is kind of an over-the-top, through-the-looking-glass version of everyone who's ever screwed up and pretended too obviously not to care, who's ever felt like a fraud, or like a jerk after a joke in poor taste fell flat; anyone who's tried to fake it til they make it and come to the gradual realization that it wouldn't ever quite work. And on the other hand, he really can be charming, and he does save the day (mostly), and he's a lot of fun when he's not taking himself so terribly seriously.

The right to be able to identify people in public.

You know what, you're right and i agree, i removed my comment as i was misled about what you were arguing. I believed you were arguing against it because of ""religious"" reasons rather than security and such. However i would also argue that there's an unproportional amount of hate against someone wearing a niqab compared to someone hiding their face by wearing a hoodie, or face tucked into a scarf etc. There currently isn't, and as far as i can remember HASN'T been many (if any) major security incidents of people wearing niqabs committing crimes.

One of the big reasons for the rapid growth of ISIS is that when we left Syria to become a wasteland many Syrians turned to those who did come to help them against al-Assad's regime. It allowed ISIS to claim a huge amount of credibility among Jihadist groups when they became a major part of the Syrian opposition which gave them a huge recruitment boost.


Oh come on we are now heading into a fuck ton of counterfactuals here.

It is just as likely that if an intervention succeeded and we blew up the dregs of Syria's infrastructure such as town hall buildings and police stations - the only difference that would have been achieved would be giving the Alawite faction a harder time.

&gt;

&gt;The __Time War__, more specifically called __The Last Great Time War__, is a conflict within the fictional [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoniverse) of the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. The conflict pitted the [Time Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord) against the [Daleks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek) and culminated in the apparent mutual destruction of both races, caused by [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)).

&gt;In the *Doctor Who* continuity, the war occurs between the events of the [1996 film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(1996_film\)) and the [2005 revived series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_1\)). It was frequently mentioned and alluded to from the first series of the show's return, but was not directly seen until the show's 50th anniversary special. The war's events and progression have never been fully explained. Short comments in various episodes act as hints, but the war was not thoroughly talked about until the [2007 series finale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_of_the_Time_Lords); the two-part special *[The End of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Time)* (2009) provided further information and revealed the Time Lord leaders' sinister endgame. The closing battles and the climax of the Time War were finally depicted in the 50th anniversary special ""[The Day of the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Doctor)"" which ultimately revealed the Time Lords' fate.

1. Trading standards. Ineffective and slow to do anything.

2. FCA is not responsible for this.

3. Citizens advice. The three times I've been, I had to hang around for 4+ hours and got bad advice that screwed me.

Best bet is hit the http://www.consumeractiongroup.co.uk/forum/content.php and post there.

They will probably advise as would I the following:

Cancel the direct debit. The mandate doesn't mean squat - it's just an agreement between your bank and theirs. No credit rating involved unlike some of the wallies replying here. It's not a contractual thing at all - that is completely separate.

Write to them and tell them to send you a copy of the signed contract including all terms agreed to. This is covered under the data protection act as a ""subject access request"". See: http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/subject_access_requests

If they don't provide this, ignore it, let them take you to court, show the magistrate the SAR request and lack of response and it will be closed there and then in your favour. Ask the magistrates for reasonable costs i.e. travel, food and any reasonable loss of income. Sometimes this works.

If they do provide this and it's not signed, do the above.

If you have signed it and it says 12 months, write a letter to the company explaining that the terms agreed to aren't the terms here and that you are adhering to the terms specified at the point of sale. then wait for them to take you to court, explain to the magistrate. It will be closed there and then.

99.5% of the time, the SAR request will make them back off if they even bother to do anything to start with. You have perhaps a 5% chance of turning up in court which will be a friendly discussion between a magistrate, yourself and their rep. Takes about 20 mins.

The magistrates are generally sympathetic towards the buying end of a transaction because there is nothing tangible changing hands and the company can absorb the cost easily and are probably misrepresenting a sale anyway.

Worst case, if it's air tight on their part, you'll have to pay it to the court bailiff. They're really nice people usually and you can just call them up and pay in instalments.

It's not scary at all at any stage even though it sounds it.

Same as a newspaper or a pint of milk.

The only things which are more expensive are a pint in the pub and eating out.

Even then I'd argue that if you're earning a lot more in London, then as a percentage of your income things are actually cheaper.

Take a pint of Stella for example: it costs £3-4 in somewhere like Cardiff but £5 in London.

If you're earning double in London like I am, then it's a much smaller portion of your earnings to buy one.

Using the same logic it's also easier to buy a car.

You would be correct, the source of which I believe as do others is religion and the secularism it has created in Arab world.


&gt;But that's kind of sidetracking from the point.

It is, my point is really that not all cultures are equal, some are more successful than others, we should be open minded adopt what works and dismiss what doesn't. I realise this sounds awful but hopefully you will understand what I mean by this, religion as we know is IMO facing its demise this century, why try so hard to hold onto a failed cultural attribute.

He may have some games where he is individually not at the top of his game but the team as a a whole is better for having him on the field. I think Rodgers recognizes that and that is why Gerrard plays as many minutes as he is physically able. Somewhere I have commented that Gerrard should come off the field in favor of a defensive mid once LFC are up two goals. This would allow him to get some rest and allow a fresh lock down D Mid to come into the game, and yes, I still think Levia in one of the top Dmids in the game.

I think that individually Sakho, Skrtel and Lovren are top center backs. It frustrates the heck out of me that they cannot seem to come together to play a solid defense.

&gt;The __bootstrap paradox__, or __ontological paradox__, is a [paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_paradox) of [time travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel) that refers to scenarios whereby items or information are passed from the future to the past, which in turn become the same items or information that are subsequently passed from the future to the past - this creates a circularity of cause-effect such that the items or information have no discernible origin. Thus, the paradox raises the ontological questions of where, when and by whom the items were created or the information derived.

Often the difference between getting a place and not is down to a few feet - not that the two houses are necessarily close to each other, they could be diametrically opposite but measure a similar distance. Different schools measure it in different ways (walking distance, straight line distance etc) which can completely change who gets in. It is a lottery, but one where the losers never had a chance.

And unfortunately kids who fail to get a place in their local school probably won't get a place at any other nearby schools either because the distance criteria is rigidly applied. So while there are enough places for everyone to go to a fairly local school, they won't shuffle things around to make that happen.

We all know that, we all accept that, no one is arguing any other way right now. We all agree that politicians are lying toads and aren't representing anyone but themselves.

&gt; I wish there was a political man*e*ouver where, Scotland, Wales and NI could have their own governments above Westminster, but still be a part of the Union.

What you're talking about, Federalisation, is exactly why I voted No. It's also exactly what's being talked about in parliament right now. They're talking about extending more devolution to each member state of the UK. I'm not sure why facebook is full of Scots condemning this at the moment. This whole thing with Cameron cutting the Barnett Formula is being railed against, but no one seems to have read any further in the article than the headline. It'll be diminished as the new fiscal powers come into play. This way each country in the UK remains as such, and also runs their own affairs. It's on a slightly longer timescale than full independence would have been, but it includes 60 million more people. That's getting our cake ***and*** eating it. We just need to join the 55% and the 45% and keep fighting for it within the political bounds we democratically elected to remain within. Support is high around the UK for this next step!

&gt; Independent Scotland would have abolished a load of the taxes too and also would have off loaded their debt to which ever country their banks moved to.

* Networking - Some businesses rely on developing deep networks with other firms (e.g. Finance, Law, Insurance e.t.c.) and being in close proximity to the other firms is important for this. CEO's can mingle with politicians and the press much more easily than they could from other locations.
* Great international travel links - Important for multinational firms. Although other cities in the UK do have this, most don't.
* Close to clients - Similar to the first point, but in my current role I could be in an architects office one day, our lawyers the next, and back to our office the day after. All these are based in London which makes it super easy. Would we choose an architect if they were based outside of London? Yes, of course. Does it help to be based in London? Yes, of course.
* 'Brain Drain' - As lots of industries are already settled in London, there are a lot of people there with industry-specific experience which will be much more difficult to find in other cities. You can raise wages in other parts of the UK, but you will still have a smaller pool of labour to pull from as not everyone will want to move.

The very same issues that affect people aged 18-65 also affectpeople who are 16 and 17. All the things you hear about on current affairs programmes directly affect many many young people in their daily lives. In my city, young men 25 and under make up more than half of the homeless population, and these routes to homelessness often start while they're still a teenager. 

I'm 28 and I'm certainly not afraid of young people having a say in issues that may not affect them, by the time they're at the legal voting age and beyond, that government will still be in power. I welcome the ideas that younger people have as a breath of fresh air. If you're 16 and a government is elected, that government has control over the policies that dictate your life until you're 21. Thats a very long time when you're young. ",0,1411502024,null,0,false,0,ckqk73h,t3_2h81ck,t1_ckqk73h,t1_ckqgvkr,null,1426857622,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

&gt;

&gt;The __European Rail Traffic Management System__ (ERTMS) is an initiative backed by the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) to enhance cross-border interoperability and the procurement of [signalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_signal) equipment by creating a single Europe-wide standard for train control and command systems.

&gt;The two main components of ERTMS are the [European Train Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System) (ETCS), a standard for in-cab train control, and [GSM-R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM-R), the GSM mobile communications standard for railway operations.  The equipment can further be subdivided between on-board and infrastructure equipment.

You're correct in a sense. People are supporting IS because they are seen to be winning.

There's not a neat split between the FSA and IS. There are other factions such as al-Nusra, and Sunnis have shifted allegiance between FSA, al-Nusra and IS.

But we were only going to give the FSA air support, which wasn't ever going to help us manage the ""near constant evolution in the balance of power"" and make sure the right people rose to the occasion. 

If a multinational force of say 100 battalions could  have been fielded, then a relatively straightforward transition could have been arranged. That would have been politically difficult without a UN resolution, which Russia would have vetoed.

And even then the presence of US or UK forces on the ground would have pissed off a lot of locals and thus increased support for IS.

I still think doing nothing was the least worst option, at least among the options that were realistically available.

1) Time of the Doctor - the Time Lords, on the word of a stranger (Clara) granting the Doctor a whole new set of regenerations that kick off with enough power to blast a Dalek ship out of the air effectively extending the Doctor's life to an undetermined degree and stopping the war over Christmas.  *Mysterious powerful and unseen beings at the last moment grant the hero the power to save the day.*

2)  Day of the Doctor - Ending the Time War by figuring out at the last minute they could go all the way back to Hartnell's incarnation and having every version of the Doctor work on the calculation to put Gallifrey into stasis, allowing the Daleks to blow themselves up, rather than use the the Moment.  *That's a pretty last-minute-Godlike power going on there.*

That's two recent ones.  At least, in my opinion.

Overuse of the sonic screwdriver for the strangest of things (Like a triple-screwdriver sonic *push* or whatever it was that blasted the Dalek out of the Gallifrey painting, scanning biological data, lifting things, blowing other things up, etc - the Doctor has certainly modded that humble screwdriver into a veritable Batman toolbelt of options) could be considered a series of examples.

false,IMKridegga,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"My favorite Doctor is Tom Baker, although he was not my first Doctor.  It's difficult to put my finger on exactly why he's my favorite as it's honestly been kind of a gut feeling since about the time I saw 'Genesis of the Daleks'.  I think initially it was because that was my favorite episode for a while and when I was 10 it made sense for my favorite Doctor to be the one in my favorite episode.  However, my reasons have evolved a bit since then:

The Fourth Doctor was a miraculous figure.  He was very kind, but also very powerful.  There was something magical about his personality and mannerisms.  He was funny, but also very serious when he needed to be.  At that point in the Doctor's life, the way he viewed himself was exactly in tune with the way he actually was.  To a certain extent, I think it's safe to say he still views himself as that charming, brilliant, and heroic wanderer of the cosmos that Four was.  And a wanderer he was indeed.  He had no home but the TARDIS and each new adventure meant tossing away all aspects of the last one to dive right into the new experience.  There was no question he didn't have an answer to; there was no problem he couldn't solve.  To say that this incarnation was invincible was not too much of an exaggeration.  When he did fall, it was in the only way he could ever have: betrayal in a brief moment of weakness.  He was confident and reliable.  This was a Doctor you could always could on.  I can only think of one instance where he hesitated to do what he had to, and it humanized him.

That is why I think the best Doctor was Four.  He was everything the Doctor is at his core, but on the surface instead of inside.  And not to mention, Tom Baker is a fantastic actor.  He was able not only to pull off this extremely difficult role, but to really become him.  That grants a certain believability to the character that is absent, not necessarily in Doctor Who, but in many other shows.  If my first Doctor had been anyone other than David Tennant, I'm not sure it would have changed the fact that my favorite is Tom Baker.",0,1411503554,null,0,false,0,ckql1mh,t3_2h8mu2,t1_ckql1mh,t3_2h8mu2,null,1426857226,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

So perhaps they'll freeze rents, telling their tenants to just put up with it, thus causing widespread discontent towards whatever government tried to reduce Housing Benefit.

The houses would normally be rented out for extortionate prices or been further developed in order to get a better return on the investment.


While wealthy foreigners are a contributing factor to the ridiculous house prices in London they're not the main reason (or at least not the only reason) it's so bad. That is things like how hard it is to get planning permission, the green belt, a general lack of affordable houses being built because they offer less profit than better equipped houses (all of which limit supply) and generally how much London as a city is popular. Places like Dalston are getting more expensive even because it's seen as a cool trendy place to live while central London needs no explanation as to its popularity.


But don't let any of that stop people from saying bankers are literally worse than hitler. I mean houses worth even 7 million are peanuts to the big banks unless they literally bought up entire streets, hint: they haven't.

When the overall London metropolis area contains somewhere up to 18 million people (almost a third of the population of the ENTIRE UK) with many more working in London who commute from places as far away as Birmingham, prices of everything including housing are going to be ridiculous.

The students find it really user friendly too; it likes to call itself 'the Facebook of education', and it is pretty easy to get to grips with.

false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;There are vast numbers of people that do not contribute more to the system than they take, that includes large swathes of tax payers.

That's based on hugely generalised figures though.

It's averaged out to such a degree it's almost meaningless.  As a for instance it'll include a share of government spending on pensions.  Pensions amount to something like a quarter of government spending.

So telling a twenty year-old, ""Sure you work and you pay tax, but you're not a **net** taxpayer!"" when you're suggesting that they're the recipient of spending like that is alarmingly disingenuous.

Strap NHS spending onto that and we're edging up against half of all government spending.  All those pensions recipients are pretty big consumers of NHS provision too.  If we decompiled the numbers and looked at it in terms of age I'd bet that the 60+ group start looking like they're not only not net taxpayers in the current view, but on a lifetime basis.

It's important to look at what those numbers say before you start telling people they're not contributing.

I'll leave you with a bonus thought:  Those figures are based on a per **person** basis.  Companies aren't factored into it.  So, the government notionally spends some money on my behalf for roads.  *(Which is good of them, since I don't own a car and I commute by train.)*  Tesco, on the other hand - Or any other company for that matter - Isn't accounted for in this.

**Key Points:**

-Our wing play is sublime. If we can get Gomis and Bony on form then teams will pay for double teaming the wings.

-Gomis. He is wonderful up front, however him and Bony need to start scoring. I understand they play a larger role than simply goal scoring, but if they don't start putting them in we could be in trouble when Dyer's form cools off.

-Top notch defending. What has been the most impressive thing this year is how fantastic our defence is. They hate conceding. 

-On the note of defence Jazz shut down an extremely dynamic winger in McGeady. He quietly turned one of Everton's better performers this year into a non factor. Feeling better about depth.

-Montero is just compact adrenaline. Jesus can he run. He plays with the confidence of a world class player. Great buy.

-Tremmel I thought was dodgy at times last year, but he looked great out there today. Some Neueresque saves.

Final thing to take away is that we just throttled a team that is supposed to be pushing for at least Europa League qualification this year. I originally saw us as a 14-10th placed team, but we are looking capable of pushing for Europa. Not excited for when these Jack bastards let me down though.

If you just bought a house, or started renting, then you have a 6-month countdown in which you can [challenge your council tax band](https://www.gov.uk/council-tax-appeals/challenge-your-band).

Check out the price you paid compared to the price of equivalent properties nearby. Then check out what council tax band you're in and what they're in.

If you can put together a letter showing evidence as to why you think your property should be in a lower band to the valuation office they may accept your arguments and reclassify your council tax band.

I did this when I bought last year and went from band E to band D. But the people who were happiest about this were my neighbours who were also band E and were automatically dropped to D (terrace properties). It was best for them because they got a refund on all the years of council tax they'd owned their properties (decade plus) for which they'd overpaid.

---

Even if you challenge your council tax banding - make sure you sign up for, and pay, your council tax as per normal. You will be refunded if you are reclassified.",0,1411506121,null,0,false,0,ckqmguk,t3_2h9d32,t1_ckqmguk,t3_2h9d32,null,1426856563,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

a.  That needs to be coupled with introducing information about politics and voting into education.  I know that's a tricky balance to get right, but it's one of many areas that the education system fails miserably in preparing people for.

b.  I'd quite like to see a notional vote for sixteen year olds that schools facilitate and encourage kids to get involved in.  Something that doesn't have an effect, but where the results are counted and reported back.  It could be done electronically, so it doesn't have to be alarmingly expensive.

Why though?  Well, there's the thing as it stands most young people's first step into this area is realising that politicians really couldn't give a flying monkey's testicle for the political leanings of the young.  But if young people were encouraged to engage with a notional vote and and they could see, ""If you all turn out you will get better representation...""  Well, hopefully they start voting and they're represented by their representatives.

c.  I've never seen this addressed anywhere, but young people are the one this stuff matters to most.  I don't mean about your interest in it.  I mean that a seventy year old who turns out to vote is basically done.  I'll be deliberately harsh on this point:  That seventy year old stands a pretty good chance of dying before the next election.  *(The one after voting.  Not next Spring.)*  A seventeen year old gets to live with the consequences of that election for probably five or six decades.

d.  Teenagers are just too dumb!  Variations of this are the usual first response.  Firstly, there are plenty of voters of all ages who choose who to vote for for amazingly dumb reasons.  *(I actually don't mind who people vote for if there's a semi sane reason.  As things stand there're areas where the Conservatives or Labour could pin the right coloured rosette on a donkey and it'd likely win.)*

Secondly, if we quit telling then that they're too dumb to be allowed to vote and that their votes are meaningless and make an effort to educate them young people would actually engage with the process.  No, not all of them, but that's true at all ages.

e.  If more young people are encouraged to be engaged with the political process more people might be interested in getting involved in politics.  The rise of the career politician coming *(Look at the current batch on either side of the Commons.  You know what I mean.)*is nothing short of corrupting and diseased.  The evidence that they're more fit to manage the state than anyone else is pretty thin.  Going back to point c. young people are stuck with the consequences of having these people in charge longer.",0,1411506482,null,0,false,0,ckqmnuk,t3_2h8551,t1_ckqmnuk,t3_2h8551,null,1426856472,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I wasn't really thinking anything, and I wasn't scared, no. Didn't really have time to panic.

&gt;Oh, my shop had a knife robbery before I joined! How was that girl's experience? Everybody's different, but it's a little hard to imagine she's not just milking it a bit.

The guy whipped out a knife, so she backed off and stood next to me, and he helped himself to the money in the till. It was just before we closed so I'd already cashed up the other till and taken most of the cash out of hers, so it wasn't even worth it. He got 3 years for that, I think?

The mods have stamped down on it; yes it means that sometimes a post you like will get removed; big whoop, deal with it. But it means that more fresh, original content reaches the front page and improves the subreddits image as a whole. 

You admit yourself that you don't visit the sub directly, spare a thought for those that do and who want new content (or at least content that hasn't been posted in the past few days). 

The upvote system is also terrible for judging popularity, as the recent Unidan fiasco proved. Posts with 5 or so upvotes from alt accounts are more likely to get noticed than a singular poster; image posts are also karma grabbers and are more likely to reach the front page not because of the quality of their content, but because that content is in a quick to digest easy package.

false,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; What does a 20 year old become? A 60 year old. The point is that if over your life you earn an average salary you will cost the system more than you have contributed.

That's not how those numbers are calculated.  They're literally, ""We spend X per person per year.""

Short of the future going all Star Trek a twenty year old now isn't going to get a pension at 60 or at 65.  

Have you seen that statistic that when the pension first came in two thirds *(or thereabouts)* of people didn't live to pension age?  It's a favourite of people who use it to argue that we can't afford pensions because of increasing life expectancies.  What they won't say to you is that those people generally paid in nothing toward a pension.  This doesn't necessarily mean pensions **are** affordable, but the argument as it gets run is false equivalence.

Many women in receipt of state pensions now paid little in National Insurance Contributions or their equivalents since they were exempted on the basis their husbands would receive pensions and keep them.

The NHS is being run down.  When that twenty year old hits sixty and has another eight or more years to work before he can retire then NHS won't be there to catch him the way it is now.  The benefits system that sixty year old could fall back on as a final safety net when they were twenty is unravelled.  

If that sixty year old went to university forty years ago they didn't get loaded up with student loans to pay off huge tuition fees.

false,cruiscinlan,null,null,"&gt; You can't argue that the government does not provide housing, disability benefit, free healthcare, and childcare allowance as part of the social contract. Your taxes ensure all of these things, they haven't gone away. You may disagree with the premise of people having to move for their social housing, but the social housing still exists.

You certainly can argue that, if the provision and quality of these benefits to the vulnerable has changed which it demonstrably has. 

&gt; I've had to move away from my home in part because the discrepancy between wages and living costs. I moved somewhere cheaper in the country where I could live better on the same wage. It's not as nice, friends and family are further away, but I am more financially comfortable. 

Surely you recognise that you are in the advantageous position of having transferable, marketable skills that are in demand outside of a large urban centre.  And also in a situation where you could afford both financially and psychologically to make such a move, perhaps you own a car for instance making transferring and storing your belongings infinitely easier.  Perhaps you were offered employment before moving as well.

&gt;I would love to live in London but I can't because I can't afford it. There are probably many thousands of people in this country who have to do this every year, especially young people. Why are people on benefits any different? If someone has a kid and is on benefits why are they any different than parents who aren't on benefits who have to leave their support networks due to housing costs?
&gt;

Some of the reasons that people on benefit would be differently able to make such moves, is because of things like educational attainment, state of their health and their material resources.  A single parent will be far less able to make such a move compared to a couple where both are working. Someone on benefits will not tend to have savings to cover things like moving costs, fitting out new living accommodation etc.  This is totally apart from the not easily quantifiable costs of taking a vulnerable person out of their familiar surroundings, support network of friends and family, or things like homesickness or depression.

 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, we're using our taxes to subsidize companies who won't pay their workers a living wage. We're telling transport companies that it's OK to make commutes so expensive that people need to live centrally. We're telling landlords that it's acceptable to keep raising rents without maintaining property standards and the British taxpayer will foot the bill, even if people are forced to live in squalor for double or triple the price of a good home elsewhere. Central London needs labour and unskilled workers. These young mothers could potentially fill these roles. But these roles need to pay enough to support actually living in London, transport costs need to come down so that people can live in cheaper areas and commute affordably, rent rises need to be capped, speculative foreign buyers who buy property and leave them empty need to be banned or highly taxed. This isn't laissez faire economics, it's the safety net protecting its long term viability and holding people in power accountable for the problems they have created. It's about a fairer deal for people living in London.
&gt; 
&gt; 
I agree with most of what you've above, although I'd take issue with the notion around moving people out and commuting in.  There are significant social and environmental costs to encouraging sprawl and sleeper towns, and in terms of things like health outcomes and marital stability the longer your commute the poorer your quality of life generally speaking.  

Rent caps are normally unenforceable, as desperate tenants will pay cash under the counter to get around them.  

&gt;Other cities will gain and London will be forced to act on these issues in order to stop the decline.

The decline of Birmingham from the 1960s and in general the donutisation of British cities is a great example of why this may not be the case: http://www.economist.com/blogs/blighty/2013/05/birmingham",0,1411508321,null,0,false,0,ckqnn4q,t3_2h7q8p,t1_ckqnn4q,t1_ckqa550,null,1426856015,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt; However i would also argue that there's an unproportional amount of hate against someone wearing a niqab compared to someone hiding their face by wearing a hoodie, or face tucked into a scarf etc.

Really? I would have said the opposite. Hoodies are likened to thugs, hooligans and chavs whereas those wearing the niqab are more often seen as [victims of oppression](http://www.express.co.uk/comment/columnists/richard-and-judy/431069/The-burka-is-a-sign-of-degradation-and-has-no-place-on-our-streets).

&gt; There currently isn't, and as far as i can remember HASN'T been many (if any) major security incidents of people wearing niqabs committing crimes.

Oh, I agree with you completely. It's always bugged me that the APT was scrapped when it was still at the prototype stage and we later sold the technology to the Italians. There's a picture on [this site](http://www.traintesting.com/APT-P.htm) from the rear cab of an APT running at over 150mph near Lockerbie.

Nothing against the 390 but compared to the [latest generation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Pendolino) of Pendolinos being introduced in Europe they're not in the same league. In my opinion Virgin skimped on the interior of the 390 - there's much less luggage space by comparison.

&gt; I do wonder what sort of speed we could get on the GWML and ECML without tilting. They're pretty straight already, and a class 91 has managed 160mph on a stretch of the ECML so it's evidently physically possible in at least one stretch without having to build an entire new line.

I would say the GWML is better suited to higher speeds, there's more sections of four track railway and it's much straighter and flatter than the ECML - I'm thinking around Sonning Cutting and Box Tunnel as examples.

The 91 doing 160 on the ECML is a bit of a red herring - it was travelling down Stoke Bank for the record (similar to Mallard's run in 1938) and of course there's the flat level crossing at Newark to consider which would limit speeds on that stretch.

Again if we look to the continent we haven't achieved the sort of interim speed up other nations have. Italy were running their first generation Pendolinos at 155 mph in the late 1980s. Now they have high speed rail and trains running at almost 200 mph daily.

Meanwhile we're still squabbling over HS2, only just electrifying several main lines and with the 91s and 390s we have two fleets of trains running at well under their 140 mph design speed on our main North - South railways. The 91s will end up going to the Midland or Great Eastern Main lines without ever having performed to their full potential on the ECML. The 390s will probably never get ERTMS which will allow them to run at 140 because parts of the WCML are still being resignalled with colour light signals over the next 10 to 20 years. By the time there's a need for ERTMS the operator of the WCML will be looking for new trains I would guess.",0,1411509227,null,0,false,0,ckqo4hp,t3_2ga1zc,t1_ckqo4hp,t1_ckq4icx,null,1426855745,2,false,uktrains,t5_2z9xu,2

Martinez came in and implemented his ideas, and they worked well- but last year was still a lot of Moyes, with just new vigor and concepts from Martinez. 

This year that Moyes Effect has worn down, and a lot more of the system is based on Martinez's philosophies- and we have seen (as I said above) shit really fall apart in the past when this has happened.

* Cancelling a direct debit to an organisation with whom you have a credit agreement (i.e. they advance you money or services in exchange for payment in arrears) - such as loan repayments, credit cards, or mobile phone contracts - such that your next payment is late or missed. Gym memberships are, in my experience, always paid in *advance*, so these aren't credit agreements and can't directly affect your credit rating in this way.
* Not paying the gym in violation of a contract (which they claim is the case, and OP doesn't), resulting in them obtaining a county court judgement against you (which *can* affect credit ratings). Any sane judge would consider it unreasonable to provide a CCJ unless the gym had *at the very least* sent a ""letter before action"" first, so OP could cancel the D/D and be *completely* safe if they settled any payments before it came to court. Or persuaded the gym to back down.

It would be wholly impractical and destructive to have some kind of practical modern challenge to the monarch - who else could afford to drive centurion tanks across Salisbury in order to make a serious challenge?

Instead, upon the death of the monarch, the current holder of the British Fencing Association title is allowed to challenge the heir.

false,tnjhawks,null,null,"I was thinking about this and I think I know the issue. Tactics. We started slow last year for the same reason. 

I was watching today and noticed that we just didn't have the movement and passing that we had last year.  When a player got a ball on the wing everyone ran into the box.  What we were doing last year was finding good runs to break up the defense and find the open man.  Now we pass it to the wing, then pass it back up around the box to the other side, then repeat.  Eventually someone will try and dart into the box and cross but it's not paying off at all. The exception was Suso's goal.   I think this lack of incisive passing leads to our defensive errors.  We end up banging a shot off a defender and the ball sails out setting up a counter attack. Or all of our players crowd into the box, our winger fails to cross the ball in, and they are set up for a good counter attack. 

Our other issue is set-piece defending.  Again I think this is a tactical issue. 

In all of these it's not because our tactics are WRONG but our new players just haven't learned them yet and the team hasn't gained an understanding with other players about who will be going where and who makes runs.  We have a lot of ball watchers and passive players who are looking for the right pass but no active players (outside of Sterling and maybe Allen) who are making those runs into dangerous areas.  

It also hurts that our main target is injured.  We're forced to rely on strikers who never really played with the team.  You can tell Balo is really trying but he doesn't quite have that understanding yet.  We are also lacking that pace and playmaking that Suarez provided. Sterling is trying to fill in but there's no one there to make counter runs and get in the right spot.  Having Sturridge back will really help.

Instead we effectively left them in an unequal fight with Al-Assad's Alawite dominated military and they took any help they could get which has shaped the conflict in Syria and ultimately allowed ISIS to consolidate enough power in one place to become what we now have to deal with (IS) which will be much much harder in the long term.  

Regarding Abu Sakkar (the cannibal guy) he was part of the Farouq Brigades (mainly composed of Islamists) and when it was publicised what he had done the military council of the FSA called for his arrest.

As for an intervention turning Syria into another Libya it's entirely possible that it would of worked out like that or it's possible that Al-Assad would of resigned and the SNC could of worked out something with the Allawite minority.

It reminds me a lot of AVB's Spurs at their worst, however their issue was up top rather than at the back (although us going forward is an absolute mess also atm when we are in a tough spot). I always felt that AVB's system was far too complicated, and required AVB level brains to work out.. I kinda worry this is happening with us. 

Under Moyes the players were glued in their very rigid, tight roles- they had simple tasks to do, and they did them amazingly well. It was football drilled so hard that instinct took over- yes it was predictable, but it was effective in making decent players look amazing. 

I think the subs look bad in hindsight, but the way he are organising (especially in the middle) we could bring on Messi, Dixie and Cannavaro and we would still look like shite. 

Last year the subs looked great, because they were new legs in a system that is working like clockwork.. Now they are new legs being throw into a pan of boiling oil and are expected to dance. 

As I say though, I think it will come. The derby is coming at a good time for us- confidence is low, but it is a game everyone expects us to lose regardless- so a bad result can't knock us down much further, but a good result (as the boys will be up for it like nothing else) could be a gigantic springboard like the Chelsea game was last year.

I have a question.  This isn't meant to be shit-stirring, it's a legitimate question because I don't understand.

Why should subscribers to /r/DoctorWho care about the ""reputation"" of the subreddit to people who don't subscribe?  I sub to both /r/Gallifrey and /r/DoctorWho - I dig discussion and I dig cool set photos from Voyage of the Damned or whatever.  Isn't that why there are two subreddits?  So those who only like one kind of content can have it?  I'm not sure why tamping down on content that gets lots of upvotes to satisfy people who don't even sub to /r/DoctorWho (it's ""reputation"" across Reddit) makes sense.

I voted yes for two main reasons. Firstly, because i want 1 of 4 million votes in a parliament with full fiscal powers, and autonomy over foreign affairs. At present i have only 1 of 40 million votes in the parliament which holds these powers. Secondly, i find constitutional monarchy an antiquated idea in a modern democracy.  
It's important to me for many reasons. Right now, i am still running high from the vote itself. I've voted all my adult life, all the elections/referendums that i have been eligible for. Thursdays vote was the first time i left the polling station not feeling like i had pissed in the wind. I felt like my vote counted, and that it actually represented my opinion about something, instead of just a tactical political vote to keep the biggest prick out.  
It was a very strong feeling. I don't want that vote to be the last that ever feels like that, but it probably will be. At least with a smaller voter base (in an independent holyrood), the sense of futility would be less powerful.
By saying that independence is still on my agenda, i mean i am going to keep talking about it with anyone who is interested (and occasionally people who aren't!). I spent the campaign not engaging in discussion, my friends/co-workers were exclusively no voters, who i don't see very often/work with every day. When i heard them sprout something that i knew was nonsense i kept silent, not wanting to ruin one of the few times i get to see them/ ruin a working relationship. Nae mare steekit moo.

false,versusgorilla,null,null,"Where as I do think that this petition is oversensitive and silly, and have no problems with the Doctor's little jokes (he seems like a school boy picking on a girl he likes) I do see what people mean about Moffat writing for women.

The biggest issue, is that he writes women as tools for the Doctor.  Amy is used to create the imagery that is supposed to trap the Doctor, the following season she is used to create the child who is supposed to kill the Doctor.  

Clara is only with the Doctor because he wants to solve some mystery about her and why he has seen so many copies of her, not because he wanted her companionship (9 and Rose) or thought she was smart enough to travel with him (10 and Martha) or he wanted someone who wanted to see the universe (10 and Donna). 

Recently, Clara hasn't had anything to even *do* in these episodes.  In the first episode of the season, she has to just hold her breath to avoid death, then she has to demand that they kill her because she won't give up the Doctor.  In Time Heist, she had to not think to avoid death and then she had to be saved by the male character sacrificing himself to save her.  

Then there is Jenny and Vastra.  It might seem at first that they are all diverse and progressive, putting a lesbian couple in your story, but he mentions it all the time.  They are constantly telling one another they love the each other, constantly winking and nodding about their relationship.  He's not writing for a lesbian couple, he's writing for a *sexy* lesbian couple who use their *sexy lesbian antics* as jokes the same way Drax uses *getting people mixed up*.

So I don't think the *little jokes* are a problem.  But I think he's a little uncomfortable writing for women-companions.  

In his defense, River was written well up until she became another tool to be used against the Doctor.  I think people would just like to see Clara do something on her own, outsmart the Doctor a bit, stand on her own as something other than someone to be saved in every episode.

If that was supposed to be a result of the regeneration, that should have been made clear; as it was, it came across as a mix of lazy show-running, lazy writing, lazy directing and a desire to keep the high-point audience of Tennant.  The entire *point* of the regeneration is to provide a break from the past, and there simply *wasn't* one here.

b)  He's unwilling to delegate enough.  The second Smith series was better, as things started to stabilise there, and the first season of Sherlock was fantastic.  But both shows have suffered as he and Gatiss try to split their time between demands of the two programmes.  To keep (or improve) the quality of the shows, they need to delegate more to the very capable people they have around them, but they're unwilling to do so.  Both programmes are hurting as a result.  It's not affecting Sherlock's numbers at the moment, but that last season was easily the worst of the three, with lots of empty filler and unbalanced scripts that should have been tightened but the Moffat and Gattiss were spending too much time focusing on DW's 50th anniversary to properly see to Sherlock.

c) He wants to be Russell T, with lots of series and spin-offs.  We saw this when he first developed the Vastra storyline, it happened when he got Sherlock on the ground, and we see it again with the constant pushing of Vastra: the constant reappearance of what isn't really a very interesting set of characters, and the constant prominence *of* those characters in the stories where they do appear.  The Capaldi regeneration episode should've focussed on the Doctor and his Companion; instead at least a quarter of the episode had Vastra as the primary character, mainly to hector and lecture poor Clara and be mysterious about the Doctor's past, all implying some long, deep and meaningful relation with the Doctor.

If this becomes another thing like River Song (who also constantly pushed at us (though it doesn't help that I really dislike Alex Kingston)) ... well, I'm not sure what I'll do.  Probably just rant and stew, but *god* I've love it if Vastra never appeared again.  Unfortunately, I think we'll be seeing her reappear until Moffat finally leaves.  Which I hope is incredibly soon, but he's not going to give it up easily and I don't think the BBC currently has the will to confine him to Sherlock.

false,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"Thing is, the bottom line isn't really the capacity - it's things like executive boxes and hospitality suites that really make the money. Cutting 5,000 fans out of the stadium is worth it if you can add in a whole extra row of executive boxes, because they just pull way more revenue on matchdays. Would be nice to get more people into the ground and cut the season ticket waiting list down a bit, but the main point of expanding is to make more money on matchdays, and in that respect it's about a lot more than the final capacity.

The other aspect will just be where the best price point is. If another 10% on the number of seats you're adding is going to add another 25% to the cost of the project then it'll start massively eating into estimated break-even time and return on investment, which makes the whole thing a lot more difficult to get off the ground. 

Fact is that in the current economy it's pretty much impossible to justify financing an entire new stadium while we're having to spend to stay in Europe (look at how Arsenal were [restricted to tiny average net spend on transfers for years](http://www.transferleague.co.uk/premiership-transfers/arsenal-transfers.html) after they built the Emirates), and Anfield is a pretty awful ground in terms of expanding it just because of the way the stands are constructed and how they are relative to each other (all various heights, gradients, etc). I'd expect to break up towards 80k we'd need to ground-share with Everton or someone else for a couple of seasons while we demolished half the stadium and rebuilt it from scratch.

Just smart casual clothing. Niqabs would never have been allowed and neither would short skirts. We were told to dress as if we were going to work. Smart shirts, trousers, long-ish skirts, blouses, cardigans, whatever.

At university we had a shit ton of Muslim students. Vast majority of the girls wore hijabs (they covered their hair only) and still wore normal clothing every other way. In fact, despite covering the hair they were probably the best dressed girls on campus (as in they dressed in style, not showing off their boobs or butts). The small minority of Muslim women who wore face veils also wore abaayas and yeah, they were a minority. It's an alienating look even when most of your student body is Muslim.

I will say that if I meet a woman in a niqab (the face-covering thing) I feel a bit alienated... not on purpose, just subconsciously. She's putting up a shield against herself and the Western world by putting that face mask on. She's basically saying ""I'm here, but I reject your society and this is how I show it."" That's at least how it feels to me. Even Islam doesn't mandate that women cover their faces. It's purely cultural. So if a young girl does this without being told to by her parents, that's why.

Yes, there are things we do in the Western world that are abhorrent to Muslims. We eat pork, we have sex outside of marriage, we drink alcohol, we smoke and we show more flesh. But ultimately there are many countries that abide by Muslim morals that wouldn't allow these things where many Muslims could choose to live and we can't change ourselves for them... most of them are completely fine with our way of living but for the few who aren't... why are they even here? 

We don't go to Saudi Arabia and shout at them and try to make them eat pork or drink alcohol or have lots of sex outside marriage. If we do go there, we respect their customs (mostly because we'd be jailed or beheaded if we didn't) and all I ask is that they do the same with us if they come to a Western country. Again, most do, but there's always that annoying minority. 

I've rambled too much now. Urgh. Either way, if Muslims are going to live here, they are welcome to practice their religion, pray 5 times a day, abstain from pork and alcohol and do whatever they need to do. But wearing a niqab is not required by their religion so we have no reason to permit it as it is just like wearing a mask as far as we're concerned. Would you let a guy wear a balaclava in class? At an airport? At a job interview? No... so why should a woman be allowed to wear a veil? Equality for both genders. Men aren't allowed to cover their faces. So why should women?

I say this as a woman by the way, I am not pro or anti either gender. Just in this case and covering faces I am talking about.

* Markovic started on the wing where we all expected him to. He was playing poorly and not taking responsibility, so Rodgers moved him to the centre,  which got him more involved in the game. 

* I'd have played Jones instead of Mig from a fairness and rotation point of view, but it turns out penalty shootouts are a thing.

* The midfield looked very energetic with Lucas, Rossiter, Lallana and Sterling.  Not a lot wrong there. 

* One up top doesn't really work for us with Lambert or Balotelli,  but nothing really does without Sturridge. The selection of Lallana and Sterling gave us enough quality just behind the striker for us to be able to see the game out even if Lambert had a bad game (which he did)

* Swapping the kids for the first sub made sense. Gives them both a run out without exposing the team by playing them both at once. Lambert for Balotelli made sense when we needed a goal and the former wasn't playing well. Can't really complain about Suso's contribution.

For a long time, breweries owned their own pubs, fully controlling their distribution to the customer, the landlord being a commercial tenant.

(Side note: they were pioneers of brand identity, at a time when many customers were illiterate, such as by decorating the exterior of their pubs with particular colours and/or patterns of tiles. The red triangle of the Bass brewery was the first registered trademark in the UK.)

A 'free house' was the exception to the rule, in that they were independently run and not tied to a specific brewery.

Jump forward to the 1980s: a government with an ideological fixation with the free market and with competition, plus lots of tied pubs which had declined into awful hovels but kept badly-managed breweries afloat thanks to 'regular customers' aka pissheads.

A limit was introduced on how many pubs a brewery could own, causing many to close the worst and sell the rest. The policy was presented as a way for small breweries and individual free houses to compete on an level field, but led to the absorption of big brands such as Boddingtons into the multinational industrial breweries, while every town acquired at least one Wetherspoons, catering for the aforementioned regulars.",0,1411519913,null,0,1411520204,0,ckqt7zg,t3_2h9nve,t1_ckqt7zg,t1_ckqr5pb,null,1426853367,9,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,9

Suso scores from another gifted ball in the second half of extra time. Good team play in the build up but Suso ultimately got the ball from a poor clearance.  
  
Then we concede a penalty in the final second of the game. If the foul didn't happen, and the ball went out of bounds, the game would have ended there. It was literally the final second. They convert.

---
&gt;One Floof lived in the house of a man called [Tom](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Tom_(Corner_of_the_Eye\)). The Floof, who had become addicted to causing mischief in Tom's life, killed his wife [Kathy](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Kathy_(Corner_of_the_Eye\)). In fear of being discovered, he hid the body in the basement and manipulated Tom into thinking that he and his wife lived separately and spoke over online messaging, despite the fact that Tom did not have an internet connection. The [Tenth Doctor](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Tenth_Doctor) arrived at Tom's house, telling him about what had happened to Tom and summoning the Floof from its hiding place. The Doctor also discovered Kathy's body in the basement. He made Tom realise what had happened, and Tom agreed to leave the house, abandoning the Floof. However, he agreed to leave an artificial version of himself on his personal computer, which would talk to Kathy's AI on a regular basis, keeping her company forever.

 [**Escape velocity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape%20velocity): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics), __escape velocity__ is the [speed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed) at which the sum of an object's [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy) and its [gravitational potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_potential_energy) is equal to zero.  It is the speed needed to ""break free"" from the gravitational attraction of a massive body, without further propulsion, i.e., without spending more fuel.

&gt;For a spherically symmetric massive body, the escape velocity at a given distance is calculated by the formula

It's also a common misconception/assumption that all soldiers or military members in general have shot and killed a bunch of people, even if they've never seen action or never had an occasion to shoot someone. So, I thought that made sense.

I think the rest of the reaction to Danny has to do with the sort of taboo nature of war and the killing of other humans. (American here, and I know the OP mentioned British stigmas, so I don't know how similar our cultures' takes on war is.) Historically, perceptions of and reactions to war (and, therefore, soldiers) change over time in any culture. In recent decades, anti-war and anti-military attitudes have become more common in many places, and some people take this to the point of being against soldiers as people and anyone who fights in wars, even if their beef is with the war or the violence, not necessarily that person as a human being. When people are passionately against something, it can be difficult not to associate people involved with that thing with a person's hatred of it.

I also hope this is addressed throughout the season as some kind of larger point (I assume it will be, with the other mentions — the Doctor being the soldier without a gun, the Doctor telling Blue he wished she wasn't a soldier, etc.).

&gt;what kind of spots would you say you have?

From that website, the most common I have are papules and pustules.

&gt; When you wash your face, how does it feel after? Does it feel tight or dry?

My face usually feels tight AND quite dry. 

&gt; When you use the sudocrem how does your skin feel after? Does it feel heavy?

Yes it feels quite heavy and it's really quite uncomfortable.

&gt; How much money do you have to spend on your skin?

I have as much money as is needed to be honest, as long as it's not over £30-40.",0,1411539306,null,0,false,0,ckr0xwg,t3_2h8mlh,t1_ckr0xwg,t1_ckqnqst,null,1426849694,2,false,SkincareAddictionUK,t5_32evd,2
