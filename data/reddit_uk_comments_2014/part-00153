It just won't be the real Doctor, and he won't have the Valeyard's memories. But the Valeyard may have his up until the point of separation.

The next thing to bear in mind is the wording of the Valeyard's origins, and the fact that the Doctor was given a fresh set of 12 regenerations. He burned one to regenerate into Peter Capaldi. But that still leaves another 11 until he reaches his ""last"" regeneration.

Free and subsidised places at private schools are available to all, you can apply anywhere and if you get a place then you're in. However grammar schools are catchment based, so unless you're living in a certain area you can't go. I know parents that have spent £200 pw on private tutors for years.. thats more than my years school fees, and I was one of the few who didn't qualify for aid. The majority of people I went to school with qualified for full EMA in the sixth form. I fully believe that private schools are open to all. 
Another way for you to think about it is as a method of redistribution of wealth. Although my fees were nowhere near this, if you send four kids to rugby or Eton (none subsidised) then that's £120k minimum outlay. If you send your children to grammar schools then you get to keep all your money to buy flats and holiday houses. One girl I know, aghast at my parents paying fees, gets to enjoy a central London flat and a holiday home in Cyprus.

Edinburgh is interesting for education. It has a high density of amazing private schools based in these ridiculously Harry Potter castle-ish buildings. Seriously, Google Image search for Fettes College, Stewart's Melville College, George Heriots. It also has public schools based on your geographic area. If you look at the [rankings for the best state schools according to exam results](http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/revealed-scotland-s-best-50-schools-for-higher-exam-passes.1387466220) you'll see that Edinburgh City represents 7 of the top 50 state schools in Scotland whereas Dundee only has 1 contender. My advice to you would be to find out form the Edinburgh Council website what the catchment areas for the state schools are and target your property search accordingly. Or if you're going private, it doesn't matter!


As for property, in Edinburgh the vast majority of people live in flats, not houses. If you want a garden, look for ground/garden level flats where you often have direct and sometimes exclusive access to the garden. You can also keep an eye for mews houses. If you insist on having your own house, you'll either have to pay the premium for Edinburgh or buy outside of the city centre.


When you say 'family-friendly', I assume you mean somewhere clean, safe, with green spaces nearby. There are so many places for you to look but I'll just list my favourites for you: Inverleith, Fettes, New Town, West End, Broughton, Stockbridge, Murrayfield, Bruntsfield, Morningside, The Grange, Marchmont, Newington, Viewforth, Merchiston, Sciennes, the right bits of Portobello. You can also find pockets of loveliness in and around Leith but it will come adjacent to some scummy bits. 


More importantly, and perhaps I'm biased, Edinburgh is the best place to live in the UK. I've lived all across the UK and Edinburgh is unique in having beauty, history, gorgeous architecture, an astonishing cultural scene, restaurants/bars/theatres and, most surprisingly to me when I came up here, the proximity to nature. You pretty much have a National Park in Holyrood on the cusp of the city centre. You see out to the sea from the heart of the city. The beaches a short drive away to East Lothian are amongst the best I've ever seen. The other, very close by, National Park (the Pentlands) has a huge snow sports centre. During the winter months, you can drive north *to go skiing*. You have lochs and running through the heart of the city is a lovely river called the Water of Leith and on a Sunday there is nothing nicer than taking a riverside stroll into Stockbridge to visit their Sunday Farmers Market.

a) we know from other countries that banning abortion does not stop them happening, it just makes them more dangerous
b) We know scientifically that before the 20 week mark the fetus is unable to feel pain, is unable to for thoughts or feelings of any kind, is not aware of anything by any standard. It resembles a human only genetically, and since we kill other things with our DNA (like warts and cancer) that isn't a good enough excuse on its own.

At the height of its power, Catalan was one of the great languages of Europe, being widely spoken around the Mediterranean. It was an official language in Sicily until the 15th century, and in Sardinia until the 17th century. You can clearly see the influence from the Aragonese standard in the Catalan flag (the ""Senyera"") today.

The Flemish/Walloon situation is a little different, in that the two regions do not quite have the same history of independence from one another. However, divisions between the French and Dutch speaking populations go back all the way to the creation of Belgium in the 1830 Conference of London (the French plan for resolving the Belgian problem was [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talleyrand_partition_plan_for_Belgium) - look familiar?). Tensions between the Walloon and Flemish peoples in the area go back even further. The Flemish movement has its roots in the 18th century, when the official language (of what was then the ""Southern Netherlands"", ruled by France) would have been French. Later on, one of the causes of the Belgian revolution was the suppression of French speakers by the Dutch in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.

TL;DR - It's very short-sighted to assume that these independence movements are modern problems. They have their roots in deep-seated divisions that go back a very long time.

true,VincentKompanini,,Old Growler,"&gt; I actually have a love for WW2 rifles, but obtaining them is extremely costly AND nigh on impossible in Britain.

Depends on your current situation bro. Firearms Certificates (FAC) are not *easy* to get, but they're certainly not impossible. If you have a rifle club nearby you can join, and that will help a lot with your application as the police will know you're more likely to be responsible and have some degree of instruction / training. Either that, or you need to have ownership / shooting rights on a piece of land that is safe for the purpose.

Then you need 2 references from upstanding people - a teacher, a next door neighbour who is a civil servant, a doctor, a priest, that sort of thing. 

Then you need storage. You can store your gun at the club if they have provisions for that, or you can invest in a gunsafe for your home. You'll need to make arrangements for both of those before the Police visit you for your interview, as you wont get an FAC without a place to store your guns.

Then you declare calibres. You have to tell that what kind of rifles you want, and for what purpose. So you might want a .22 for messing about with, then .303 so you can get a Lee-Enfield. You can add calibres after you've been granted the FAC but there will be an additional admin cost.

true,clairebones,,Belfast,"But there is my point - if you don't include religious reasoning, then where is your basis that the fetus is 'a human having their life taken away from them'?  There is no scientific or logical basis for this.

Here are some costs of pregnancy that I have never seen a pro-life person offer to a pregnant woman who doesn't want to be pregnant:

* Trips to and from the hospital
- Loss of work due to both hospital visits and maternity leave
- An entire new set of clothes since your old ones don't fit
- Multivitamins and potentially an entirely new diet
- Changes to your daily behaviour 
- Cost of getting someone to help around the house since your mobility is so restricted
- Cost for therapy for the emotional trauma you have just suffered during 9 months of being trapped in a body where your control has been stripped from you
- Cost of losing your social life since you cannot do the things you used to do
- Cost of possible career setback from taking maternity leave

Benefits for single parents are not the same as benefits for pregnant women. No woman should be forced to carry a fetus she doesn't work and then be told ""But if you have the baby you'll get benefits!"" That would be a life of misery and regret for both mother and child.

true,rapgamekripke,null,null,"With Lambert leaving as well, I’ve had a bit of a think on how I feel we ought to position ourselves in order to sustain (and build a platform for progression), in spite of seemingly losing the spine of our side.

I don’t think we can really allow ourselves to lose more first team players than Lambert, Lallana and Shaw. Added to that, it’s quite possibly time to cut our losses on Ramirez and Osvaldo. There’s no way we can bring Osvaldo back into the fold. Ramirez still has a lot to offer in my eyes, but I wouldn’t be surprised or distraught to see him go. 

From these 5 leaving, I think we can bring in around £75M. I’ll assume that this is a reasonable upper bound of spending for incoming players, because even before the first team upheaval we’ve been in dire need of more squad players (particularly in attacking positions).

We can also expect a few peripheral players to potentially leave; Hooiveld, Gazzaniga (needs a loan spell) and Mayuka, on top of Guly.
Before bringing in new players, we need to assure and retain some of those we have; Cork and Fonte are experienced heads, we need to keep as many first-team players from our rise up the leagues as we can.

Our success over the past few years has come from a core of young British players and I think that we ought to position ourselves as a club that develops and grows them; a proven platform from which they can break into the England squad and eventually move to bigger (more vulture-like) sides. 

I think we’d need to buy the following: back-up goalkeeper, centre-back, left-back, 3 x attacking/wide midfielders, 2 x strikers.

These are the kind of players I think we can realistically target and if we bring in enough, should form the basis of a young and hungry side, full of potential: Steven Caulker, Aaron Cresswell, Will Hughes, Tom Ince, Nathan Redmond, Remy Cabella, Thorgan Hazard, Danny Ings, Patrick Bamford, Michy Batshuayi

I’d be relatively pleased if we brought in Caulker, Hughes, Cabella, Ince, Ings and Batshuayi, with one of Bamford/Hazard on loan, plus a LB. With the rest of the squad we have, plus academy talent coming through, I think that we could turn an awful situation into a sustainable future.

We’d obviously need a good manager to oversee this – Thomas Tuchel would be my pick, though may be slightly unrealistic. I wouldn’t mind Yakin, Koeman or even McClaren either. I wouldn’t want a typical English coach and definitely not Laudrup – seems to leave a bad stink behind after he leaves.

We need a bit of strong leadership from the board/Reed firstly, we look as though we’re being held to ransom by players/other clubs, we need some decisive action rather than the empty words currently coming out of SMS.

Ahh, well believe it or not you've been to London more times than I have! I am from the north of England, so I know most of cities in the north. I also know a decent amount about the countryside in England, but my knowledge on London itself is lacking. You probably know than me!

Rent wise, it entirely depends on the town or city you are in or even the area of the city you're in. For example I am in from the city of York, which is only a small city but is seen as a very desirable place to live so rent and house prices are high. Keep in mind that you can get considerably cheaper rent by living further out of town and public transport is generally speaking, very good. Compared to Iceland, if you live in one of the major cities it can actually be a bad idea to own a car (especially in London). Iceland was great for getting places in a car IMO (I hired a car while I was there).

I have many gay friends, but I don't know too much about the LGBT community. Brighton is seen as the the ""gay capital"" of England, if that interests you. Otherwise Manchester and London have the largest LGBT communities.

If you like the countryside you must check out:

* The Lake District - Beautiful mountainous area.
* Cornwall and Devon (the south west) - Pretty countryside, coastline and beaches.
* North Wales, Snowdonia and Anglesey - Beaches, mountains and pretty views.
* Highlands of Scotland - If you get chance, this is a long trip from the south/London.

I tended to work weekends at a yacht club, for weddings, not much, but better than nothing.

The week before graduation I get a phone call asking if I can work that weekend. No, I'm busy all weekend, like I told them. The Friday night I get another phone call asking if I can work on the Saturday, I repeat that I will be busy graduating tomorrow. They then say that an early morning cleaning job has come up on the outskirts of town for two hours each day at 4am. I tell them that I cannot drive, and buses don't run that early. They say I could just get a lift with someone, or get a taxi. If I did this, I would spend more on a taxi than I would get paid.

true,JamJarre,cnty-uk,Liverpewl,"I've lived in a few places:

**London**

Pros:

*Plenty of museums, parks and things to do
*Generally reliable public transport including extensive all-night bus services
*Good nightlife
*Probably the best place in the UK to find work

Cons:

*Ridiculously expensive place to live, with rent alone about twice as expensive as anywhere in the North
*Difficult to enjoy the nightlife when your single spirit and mixer costs £8
*Massive overcrowding, especially in parks and pubs (I mean, who reserves tables in pubs, really?)
*Public transport cannot cope with the size of the population, making commutes absolutely horrific
*No sense of community except in tiny localised areas
*It's a transient city; people tend to only stay for a few years and then leave
*Rampant crime in some areas, generally high crime rate across the city
*Flytipping everywhere
*Chicken shops everywhere
*General rudeness of Londoners

**Liverpool**

Pros:

*Exceptionally good nightlife
*Generally friendly people - certainly willing to chat to you whether in clubs, on the bus or whatever
*Very cheap place to live
*Some of the best museums, galleries and architecture in the country
*Third of the city is green space, including some excellent parks
*Low crime rate
*Great music scene
*Girls who don't wait around for you to make a move
*Generally an attitude of honesty and ""what you see is what you get"" - almost zero preoccupation with what other people think, which leads to some interesting fashion choices. A city that is completely unashamed of who it is, warts and all
*Public ownership of art, tradition and other community-based activities. People really care here
*Strong sense of community that is open to adopting outsiders and bringing them into the family. Never lived anywhere with such an unshakeable sense of all being in it together.
*Nobody buys The SUn

Cons:

*Difficult to find work
*Small city - very easy to get bored of going to the same places
*Terrible local council and a general lack of investment in infrastructure
*Public transport is pretty bad, especially the buses
*Continuing obsession by the city authorities with The Beatles
*Sometimes you really just don't want to make bus friends
*Can come across as prickly and difficult to people outside the Liverpudlian community, sometimes in a way that's really unjustified - touch of a martyr complex (though often with kernels of good reason in there)

**Oxford**

Pros:

*Beautiful city centre
*Tons of history, and a really relaxed atmosphere
*Amazing parks and local scenery
*Seriously, it's beautiful

Cons:

*Outside of the city centre the town is rough as a dog's arse; pretty much just another market town
*Hideously expensive
*Very small city with little in the way of nightlife
*Town on a Saturday is like a scrum because there's nowhere else to go - Cornmarket is always a sea of people

The fact he apologised a few minutes later doesn't change the fact he probably wouldn't have a problem using the same demeaning language behind closed doors in future.

But the problem is the culture, not individual statements by a footballer, or a tv presenter or whoever.

I feel like the way these individual incidents are portrayed, is that ""if nobody *dares* say it on tv, then that's mission accomplished"", when its not, if the same people feel exactly the same way, it barely changes anything. Especially because that only leads to people going ""people are scared of saying it like it is on the tv nowadays, pc gone mad"".  

The goal instead should be ""everyone on tv (and hopefully everywhere else) know its wrong to speak about women like that"", not just they're scared to.

true,glguru,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"While I agree with you to a certain extent you have to admit that all religions are like that. Religious ideologies (in fact any ideology without any solid foundation other than pure myth or belief) relies on mass support to gain momentum. The crusades, medieval Europe, mass genocide of Jews in WW-II etc. have all been masses of religious people spewing their hate for another community or religion. 

Obviously, such a thing exists in Islam and is called ""Jihad"". In spirit it means rising up against anything unjust and unfair towards Muslims as well as non-Muslims. However, as a systematic part of the brain-washing being done by the extremist Wahabi sect, Jihad was made a mandatory part of religion. It was declared an essential part of Islam, whereas it had not been historically and had always been considered optional. Text books and sermons were re-written to include this and preach this. It became the focus of Islam. So quick was the transition fueled by foreign money that within two to three years everyone was talking Jihad. It was also especially relevant in Pakistan and Afghanistan since there was an enemy to defeat. Pakistani Army rode this wave and created ""Jihadis"" against India. Unfortunately the Soviet war ended and the situation with India improved but the ideology could not be reverted. Billions were spent preaching this extremism and not a single cent was spent on education. The end result is the chaos that you see around us. In less than 30 years, this ideology has caused millions of death and unimaginable grief. 

All monotheistic religions will die, much like the pagan religions preceding them. Unfortunately they die a slow death and take many with them. We are at the beginning of the death of Islam.

true,barejokez,null,null,"ok, i'll try not to be negative here, but do please read and believe me when i say i have your best interests at heart:

your post is written in a way that makes investment professionals (like myself) get very nervous. saying things like ""get in now before it's too late"" are like a red flag to us, because it smacks of someone trading/investing for the wrong reasons. that may or may not be true in your case, but that's how it sounds when condensed into an anonymous internet post.

the reason people have told you previously (and may well do again) not to get into this with that sort of mindset is that history is littered with stories of people in your position who get mugged by the market.  a lot of people see the returns that can be achieved and are enchanted into believing they can do the same. some will get lucky, many others will start losing money and not know how to deal with it - they will double up on a failing stock or sell out of a good position that has a blip. believe it or not, the people on here (and elsewhere) are not heartless bastards who want to steal the savings of a teenager. we want to stop you throwing it away.

that is the mindset of the negative people, but it is based on the reasonable assumption that you are a novice (your word, after all). we can't stop you, and personally, i'd rather warn you (see above) and then try and guide you to doing things sensibly (see below).

i don't know how much you are taught about investing/valuing a stock in economics classes, but there is a fair amount of science to it. consider two imaginery examples:

1. a company has paid a dividend of £1 per year to each shareholder for the past 10 years. nothing has changed in the company's management or wider industry in that time, and no change is expected.  how much would you pay for 1 share in this company?

2. a company's share price has gone up by 1% per day for the past 10 days.  what will it do tomorrow?

the examples have similarities, but are very different.  the first one can (almost) be solved mathematically (if you make a few assumptions / have more information).  ask yourself how, or ask us.  i reckon the regular posters on here would come up with a fairly narrow range of estimates for the answer. 

if you took a poll of people here on the second one, you would get a 50/50 split. some would believe the stock had momentum, and would continue to climb, others would argue it is overdue a correction.  

making money on the stock market is about being right more often than being wrong (and being able to recognise when you are wrong).  you won't achieve a 100% success ratio, but 70/30 would be enough to make money. to do that though, you need to avoid making 50/50 calls.  if you can construct an argument against the stock that is equally believeable as the pros, then leave it alone. that means not investing because you have a hunch or because recent performance has been good. only invest if you understand why.

a final point to remember, if you know something, so does everyone else.  saying a company is ""expanding"" is not enough.  is it growing by 5% or 10% per year? if everyone else thinks it is 10%, and you only believe 5%, then you shouldn't be buying.",0,1401450088,null,0,false,0,chus1v9,t3_26t1cj,t1_chus1v9,t3_26t1cj,null,1434017994,4,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,4

Factor in low consumer confidence, along with squeezed incomes and it's a good mix for Pound Land. Consumer confidence surveys suggest that habits such as switching to cheaper grocery lines/stores are now ingrained behaviours, and even though wages are supposed to have start increasing why would people want to switch back to the likes of Tesco/Morrisons when they feel they are getting similar quality for less money.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Why?

For me, it's Lambert; he's different to our other striker options, in a good way; he offers some physicality, and has good hold-up and link-up play.

This means if we play the diamond, Lambert can play well as a second striker, allowing Suarez, Sturridge, or Borini to be direct and play off the last man. People compare Borini to Kuyt, but Lambert in this role would really match Kuyt in Kenny's caretaker stint - when we played Suarez &amp; Kuyt together up top with Maxi as a no. 10, similar to our attacking set up in the diamond now.

If we play the 4-3-3, Lambert's less likely to end up isolated and ineffective - always a risk in a 4-3-3, which is why physically strong forwards with good link-up play are often a success there (Drogba at Chelsea, Ibra at Barca until Messi whinged about wanting to be the CF, Benzema at Madrid). 

As a striker, Borini is most similar to Sturridge - not in quality, but in skillset, best used as a direct option making runs off the last man and receiving the ball in goalscoring positions. Sturridge is too skilful to call just a poacher, but Borini's a bit of a goal poacher. Borini's lack of physicality could be an issue in the 4-3-3, while in the 4-4-2 he may not work well alongside Sturridge - though he'd be fine next to Suarez.

The physicality thing is important, too - more teams next season are going to line up against us like Chelsea, Palace and Newcastle did, and play for the draw.

The 'no pet' rule is generally put in place so that problem animals (and their problem owners) can be removed. The real concern is barking dogs and cat-hoarders, not bunnies. 

I'd suggest you find a landlord who deals with tenants directly (sometimes, agents just find tenants and the landlord does the rest). That way, s/he can get to know (and trust) you. You can always ask to meet the landlord before signing. Our agents said ""strictly no pets"" but the landlord was like ""Nah, that's cool"", even though he doesn't really like cats much (he's a dog person).

Just a tip - landlords who own lots of properties are often more trouble than they're worth. Our best experiences have always been with owners who used to live in the property and have moved on to a bigger home; as they have lived in the house themselves, they tend to have an emotional connection to it and don't just see the property (and therefore the tenant) as just another opportunity to rake in the cash. 

We have a great relationship with our landlord, he drops by for a cuppa and next week we'll be going over to his place for dinner, it's a much better way to do things. I find that estate agents usually just hinder communication and cause problems with their red tape. We, as tenants, are particularly keen to do right by our landlord because we have a good relationship with him and he's a nice guy; he trusts us and doesn't need to worry about his property, it's win-win.

After a century of evil markets and capitalism seeking to automate our entire lives, these statistics show that we have massively improved on most things. But as we are talking about unemployment, the graph on page 24 shows how well we are doing. 

The graph stops at 2000 unfortunately, but it gives you a good idea of why unemployment is not generally increasing.

Unemployment is not increasing, certainly not as part of an overall trend. Work may be becoming more skilled, but we are also becoming more educated. 

There will always be unemployment, if you will only accept 100% employment, then you will never be satisfied.

Right now, we have 1 of the best strikers in the world, and 1 of the best strikers in England if not Europe (this time next season there won't be an 'if', I hope), and a young backup who knows he's not as good as the others but has shown he can score and succeed in the PL.

They're also all strikers who have succeeded this season by being direct and exploiting space conceded by the opposition. Next season, there'll be less of that - more teams will set up against us like Chelsea, Newcastle and Palace, and play for the draw at Anfield. Suarez and Sturridge will still do well because they're that good - see West Brom at Anfield, another team that defend tight and narrow but weren't ready for those two playing on Fowler Mode - but they mightn't be as consistently glorious as they were this season either. 

So, what sort of 4th striker would you want to add to that? 

- Someone who fits in that tier below Suarez &amp; Sturridge, to keep them both sweet. The last thing we want is Sturridge complaining about a lack of games and leaving.

- Someone good enough for the PL - no more Aspas-like gambles. (Harsh on the lad, but fact is we want proper depth)

- Someone who offers a different skill-set (physicality, hold-up play and link-up play), but still fits our overall philosophy (pressing, having good technical ability to be comfortable with the ball in possession, and a great mentality)

From your link:

&gt; The GB Domestic drivers’ hours rules apply to most passenger-carrying vehicles and goods vehicles that **don’t have to follow the EU rules.**

The vast majority of truck drivers in the UK are on EU Drivers Hours rules which are 9hrs driving per day extended to 10hrs twice a week and maximum duty time of 13hrs per day which may be extended to 15hrs three times a week. 

There is a very short list for those who are exempt from EU rules and who use domestic rules. [Here's the list of those who can use UK domestic rules](https://www.gov.uk/drivers-hours/exemptions-from-eu-law). Everyone else must comply with EU rules.

The swan wasn't owned by anyone, it isn't in danger of extinction, and he killed it fairly quickly and humanely. The usual option to kill birds is to shoot them, they fall out of the sky, and they may or may not be dead when they hit the ground or afterwards.

*You* are suggesting there should be a caste system.

You're suggesting that working class kids be stopped from going into upper-middle class lives, because they don't ""belong"" there. In the Indian caste system, the Shudras are stopped from going into Vaishya lives, because they don't ""belong"" there.

The only difference between your caste system and one that exists in India is that the Indian version bars social mobility based on a perceived benefit to those in ""higher"" castes, whereas yours seeks to bar social mobility based on a perceived benefit to those in ""lower"" castes.

true,dexyds,flair8,,"100% agree. This sub seems impervious to the idea that Bobby isn't the saviour for Spurs' front line. If your answer to this question is Bobby, what are you basing your argument on?

That he scored lots of goals in Spain? It's a solid argument, previous goal-scoring records are usually a pretty good predictor of future performance in another league, but not always. We've seen strikers not settle in the premier league before, hell we've seen strikers lose what they had in the premier league. Goal scoring is often heavily influenced by a players confidence and unfortunately for some, once that's gone it's much harder to get back. So far, he's played over 20 premiership games, and never looked particularly dangerous. 

The issue is age, Bobby and Ade are a year apart and getting to the wrong side of 30 quickly. Neither have many years left at the top of their game. 

Ade is a proven goal-scorer in the premier league. He's not the most lethal and agree with Spursfan101 that he's not in the same league as suarez and co, but last season he created and scored goals from nothing. 

Soldado is proven goal-scorer in Spain. But in over 20 premiership games, he only mustered 2 from open play. He may kick-on and find his goal scoring form of Valencia, but even that record isn't a hugely better ratio then Ade's for Spurs (I'll be honest I'm taking out the 2012/2013 season in saying that!) 

Anyway, if Wikipedia is to be believed, this is redundant anyway as his page now says:

true,ChuckFH,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"Agency will definitely try and extract a fee from the company if you go and work full-time for them.  This happened to me years ago, when I first moved to Glasgow and was doing agency temp work.  

I covered for another temp at a company for a couple of days, after which they asked for me to replace the other (apparently incompetent) temp.  

After working there for couple of months, they offered me a full-time position, but didn't fancy paying the agency fee (% of salary), so asked me to lie to the agency and say I was off to work elsewhere.  Being young and naive, I did so, making up some cock and bull story.

Fast forward several months and for whatever reason the agency has gotten suspicious, had a look on my new employer's website and found a picture of me in the staff section.  Cue a comedy phone call where the agency phones up, asks for me by name and then is all like ""HA! we caught you. We're going to tell your boss and you're going to get FIRED! * diabolical moustache twiddle *""

The best bit was handing off the call to my boss who, in a rather bored sounding voice says ""Really, oh I must have missed that clause.  You'd better send us an invoice then"" and then hung up, totally deflating agency bitch's scheme.

Long story short, at the time it cost less to pay the agency fee than to advertise in the employment section of the two largest local papers.  ",0,1401454538,null,0,false,0,chut632,t3_26v53l,t1_chut632,t1_chusapk,null,1434018515,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"&gt; His ability to split up play when he's not on the ball, how he'll consciously drag defenders out of position to help other attacking players round him.

Good points. He's more mobile than Lambert for sure, but I think Lambert's movement is more intelligent. But I'll happily chalk that one up as advantage Borini.

&gt; Ricky Lambert in my opinion, has two years remaining at a high level and he'll die off. 

Is that really a problem, especially at 4.5m? See what Bellamy offered us under Kenny - yeah he was free, but also more injury-prone and on higher wages (coming from City rather than Southampton). It's also good because it means that maybe in 2 seasons a youth product steps up (maybe not, yeah), and adds experience to a young squad.

&gt; Borini's young, offensive and can be molded into the type of player we want.

Agreed, and definitely a positive. I don't see how Lambert isn't offensive, but I will say Lambert's already the type of player we want - he's coming from another PL side where everyone presses from the front, and they like to play intricate passing football.

&gt; For me, the main advantage to having Lambert is he fits in the English demographic.

With Gerrard, Sturridge, Henderson, Allen, Sterling, Johnson, Flanagan, and Borini we're already good on the British quota. (You know Borini counts as England-grown for PL and UEFA, right? Cheers Chelsea) And that's before you count Martin Kelly, plus guys like Wisdom, Suso, and Ibe who might get involved either this season or next.

As for Soldado, I don't think we ever should have chased him. He's a great player, but its difficult to transition from any league to the EPL...especially since he's been there so long. 

For the sake of the argument, I would let Soldado leave as he will field a higher price and Atletico are going to have more to spend.

We've had 'em since May 12th 2011 (just went back to find my [selfpost](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/h9ora/just_had_solar_panels_photovoltaic_installed_on/) on it) and it's made ~6000kWh (I don't know if this is total production, or just the excess power it's made), so about 5.5kWh per day average, or ~2000kWh/year.

No-one would have gotten into solar power without the subsidies. The panels will not pay for themselves without it. My Dad got the panels as an investment, primarily, and apart from mega-rich ecologically minded people I don't think anyone got into solar purely for the environmental reasons.

As for the circumstances that allow people to install panels (homeownership, roof direction, ability to absorb the installation cost)... I think that's an issue unrelated to the subsidy. I don't think installing PV panels is suited to people who are renting, because it's a long-term return and renting is potentially unstable. I know if I had the money to spend to install a PV system and was renting, I wouldn't, just because moving would cost me a lot of money each time *or* I'd have to sell it to the landlord when I move out, transfer the tariff, etc. It'd be a big legal mess.

Really I think a better green strategy would not involve home-based PV yet and would focus more on society. Improving public transport, cycle routes (ideally off of roads, as sharing with traffic puts a lot of people off), making people basically more aware of alternatives to cars and more inclined to use them.

At the same time, focussing on large scale power production improvements and across-the-board power consumption reduction.

As to how getting their info from aides is different from news corporations you are adding an unnecessary hop that can filter what may have already been filtered.

I decide if it's biased or faulty or if I need to see other sources.  If I get my information from someone who watches these sources for me I am getting their impression of what they have seen and basing my own impression on their impression.

Red recruitment are excellent from what I've heard and they always have plenty of jobs going. They also take on people who don't have a Bristol address so you can always find a job before you move if you'd rather do it that way.
A lot of the jobs are phone based so you may find that a problem if you have a thick accent, just something to think about!

Also, seeing as they weren't armoured the mpg wasn't *too* horrific. On-road they'd get around 5-6 mpg and were capable of 45-50 mph. We had petrol engined ones, but I believe the diesel variants were slightly better still.

true,hotcod,null,null,"The argument basically is that ""bands"" (I'll get to that in a minute) don't get much per stream of a song compared to a play on the radio. Ignoring completely of course that a stream is to one (or a small number) of people while the radio can be thousands or even millions. When you look at it as money made per set of ears rather than per play then spotify and the other streaming services aren't as awful as the recording industry would like to make out that they are. 

Now on to Mr Yorke

&gt;Make no mistake, new artists you discover on Spotify will not get paid

Yes, they, will. Well if they are independent that is, if however they [are with a record label](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100712/23482610186.shtml) they can make the label money and *still* end up own the label money. 

It works like this, the band gets picked up and the label gives them an advance. This covers their living costs as well as all the costs of recording, producing, marketing, distribution, management and legal costs. Basicly everything even including tour support and some video making costs are lumped on this tab. In exchange for this giant lone they get 20% of the royalties and lose their copyrights to the label. 

Now here's the insidious bit **the band have to pay that advance back from their 20% of the royalties**. Not sales, not gross, the bands small cut. Let that sick in for a moment and try and think about what that means... yes, that rights, the label can recoup the costs of the advance from record sales and still claim that the band owes them money for that advance. In fact it's possible for a band to sell millions of records and never see a single penny from their sales even when the record company in massively, over all, in profit from the bands work. They even have the gaul to use this to claim that most bands ""lose"" them money as justification for the hard terms of the contracts they offer.

It's sickening and people like Yorke are from the very *very* small cadre of musicians for which the system has worked and seem to have totally forgotten how the industry fucks over new artist long before spotify even comes in to the picture.

Spotify and streaming services undermine record companies monopoly on production and distribution and they *hate* it because it's forcing them to treat artist... shock...fairly because the artist's are no longer totally beholden to the labels as gatekeepers. So they are waging war on streaming boht from the inside (big labels own most of spotify stock and the fact that spotify and the like can't pay out to the artist as much as they like is largely in part to the label trying to squeeze every penny they can in deals needed to license their music in the first place) and the outside with propaganda and deliberate misinformation.  

In short the labels are fundamentally screwing both artist and streaming services (and thus the artist *again*) and unfortunately some people, like Yorke, are eating up the bullshit excuses they are trying to feed everyone. Spotify, streaming, is not the problem, the labels are.

As I said when Carroll left to West Ham on loan right at the start of Rodgers' spell, it's not that Rodgers never works with a big man - some of Swansea's success in their first PL season came from using Danny Graham as a physical presence (important in a 4-3-3 to stop the striker becoming isolated) to hold up the ball and link up play, and bring their main goalscoring threats, Sinclair and Sigurdsson, into the game from deeper positions - as well as get on the end of things themselves.

In OPs case, he did go to interview, which I suppose is more than just a promise of work, but I always take the approach after introductions of trying to minimise the distance between myself and my counterpart - whether a job, a rental agreement, a purchase order or any other agreement.

If you spend any amount of time in business where contracts like this are the norm, then you would be astounded about how much negotiation goes on, hush-hush agreements and ways to get around certain clauses. Sadly I wish this wasn't the case but it seems to be an industry standard where I work - especially where bigger companies outsource.

There I agree it raises some eyebrows but unfortunately it doesn't matter - if you go back within that time period and the recruiter finds out - they can bill the company. End of story.

I do and I know - but this generally seems to only effect more questionable companies and agencies - those that are on the level between each other seldom ever fall foul.

Outside of halls, I'm pretty sure all the housing is terraced houses, I lived in one of these for my first term of last year (don't hesitate to accept your housing placement or you'll lose it), I wouldn't recommend them, not only are they of a lower quality, you'll likely be with a smaller amount of people and barely any first years, I felt incredibly isolated when I lived away from halls.

I think BCU are planning on moving everything into the city centre eventually, if you're still there when they move your course, I'd recommend [Unite](http://www.unite-students.com/birmingham). I'm currently living in Curzon gateway and I'm loving it, 3/4 size bed, ensuite and on the same street as the Millennium Point &amp; Parkside buildings.

Can't pretend to be an expert on Redknapp but he's known for both doing wondrous things at Tottenham (which was what we all hoped he'd do for us) and disatrous things for Portsmouth (drove them to bankruptcy IIRC, which is what the rest of the world hoped he'd do to us).

There are Financial Fair Play rules regarding how much a team can spend relative to their income, but they are fairly new and inconsistently enforced, so we'll have to wait and see. Maybe someone else can add a bit more?

Fernandes seems to be well-liked by the fans and genuinely 'in it for the long run' unlike some rich owners who see it doesn't go well and bail, leaving the club in more shit than it started. Evidence of this is plans for a new stadium appearing every now and then.

During the transfer window, we've been linked with a number of ex- and current england players, such as Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard, Ashley Cole and Peter Crouch. Personally, I'd be happy with Lampard since he's absolute quality and seems to be a nice enough guy not to be one of those high-wage leeches on our funds that don't contribute. I'd also take crouchy as he has prior links with the club (before we got rich) and he's a memory I have of going to QPR as a kid. Not so sure about the other two.

&gt; It's also interesting as the inevitable Cornish resignalling will take out one of the remaining islands of mainline semaphore and mechanical signalling.

I am waiting to see the fallout when Network Rail finally have to resignal the Shrewsbury area. On the one hand semaphore signals are part of our railway heritage, but then again there's no excuse why every line in the country shouldn't have had colour light signalling installed years ago.

&gt; If Wales can have an arguably arbitrary reason to have its own signal centre

I suspect that is down to Network Rail defining Wales as a single [region](http://www.networkrail.co.uk/Network_Specifications.aspx) now (they have done the same with Scotland too).

Neither really make much sense because of the majority of cross-border traffic to and from England.

&gt; why can't South Wales be run from Didcot too?

Good question. I think the idea of 12 regional control centres is spreading things a bit too thinly.

As you say:

&gt; there's no reason why there can't be one in Plymouth or something to handle Taunton to Penzance

I think centralising things to 12 or so massive ""operations centres"" will also lose a lot of local knowledge. People in Plymouth will have a better idea of their local geography than people in Bristol after all.

FFP is financial fair play. I don't know all the details but basically there is a limit to the amount of losses you can make (6 million ish i think for championship teams) and QPR made a big loss.

Harry's style is abit oldschool. He changes around things too much and in other things he is stuck in his ways and not flexible sometimes.

I just moved last year from a flat in Newhaven (old fishing village, long since swallowed up by the city) to the 'burbs in Davidson Mains and now have a house with gardens, garage, and enough bedrooms for my wee family. 

My main concern was the schools, and we are now in the catchment for some of the best in the city. The area is quiet, safe, and has a real sense if community. Many if the areas mentioned will be like this, and as you probably know, there is nothing like opening a door and letting your kids go wild in your own garden. For the price range you mention you can get this no worries. 

What the others haven't mentioned is that edinburgh is a tiny city and is serviced by a superb cycle network that means it is often quicker to cycle about town. I can cover the 5 miles to work in under 20mins on the cycle paths. The public transport is pretty good too so you should consider that hen you look at where to stay.

Use these reports to make sure there's nothing obviously wrong with your current credit reports. Particular things to look out for is not being registered on the electoral roll and for incorrect data being listed. You may want to disassociate yourself from anyone else listed as related to you if you have no financial link to you, especially if they have poor credit.

Once you've fixed any issues with your credit reports, you can start applying for a credit card. The best idea is to pick the bank you are currently using for your current account, especially if you have your savings with them too. This will give them a better idea of your financial responsibility than if they only had to rely on your credit report.

Once you get your credit card, make sure you set up a direct debit to pay the entire amount off at the end of the month. This is important, because you do not want to miss a payment.

Finally, start using the card at least once a month. You don't have to use it for a lot, but have some usage and pay it off in full, each and every month. This way, you can build up a history of being good with credit. Not using the card will not help you as much as using it.

true,wings22,eng-GreaterLondon,London,"As it looks like no one bothered to read the article I'll sum it up based on the some of the moronic responses in here:

1. The MP in question is suggesting that it is wrong for Google to make ad revenue from pirate websites. Asinine comparisons to ""omg da highways agency isn't stopping drug dealers"" fall apart if you were to compare like-to-like: if the Highways Agency was making money putting up adverts on the side of the road, ""next rest area, cheap heroin!"" paid for by drug dealers, then it would be similar.

2. ""errmerrgerd, they like LITERALLY believe google is teh interwebz hur hur"". Well actually, this is what they said: ""As the main provider of search facilities in the UK it is widely felt that Google should **take the lead** in setting responsible industry standards for search,"" Weatherley says in the report. However he **added that ""no one single player""** is capable of solving the piracy problem, and it is **""inaccurate, unrealistic and a diversion""** to focus on Google and search engines such as Microsoft's Bing and Yahoo as the only solution.

3. ""It's not Googles job to police the internet"". No, but as previously established, Google is not the internet. It is their job to police their own site though, just as it's Ebays job to remove stolen goods when notified.

4. ""Google holds no more responsibility for it than the Post Office does if I receive pirated goods via mail.."" Did you call the post office, ask them for advice on where to get pirated films, and they pointed you to a business, in the process getting a nice little kickback for themselves? In this situation the Post Office would be much more similar to the Internet than Google anyway. Google would be like a newspaper, running adverts for pirated software, which you then receive through the post. The paper isn't selling the stuff itself is it?? Why should it be responsible?? Do you think the newspaper has a responsibility to not advertise stores that only deal in stolen goods (assuming they are made aware)?

The Greens were only polling at 12% in England and so this ruling did not apply to them. 

It's not the BBC making this decision, it's a legal ruling that they are bound by, they have to give equal coverage once a Party passes a certain vote percentage or a certain poll percentage and that's NOT their decision, it's a legal decision taken by OFCOM which they are then bound by under the terms of their charter. 

Don't blame the BBC for this for goodness sake, it's not a conspiracy against the Greens, it's just a reflection of the fact that more people indicated an intention to vote UKIP than Green, this is mostly the fault of the Greens' for thinking Party Politics is beneath them and not bothering to campaign seriously beyond their small established voter base.

""To me, he looked very uncomfortable and devoid of ideas on the left. All his runs were along 90 degree angles, to go to the byline, or cut back in to shoot on his weaker right foot after adapting his shot to prematurely shoot because he had recently developed the ability to do so from the mirror location cutting in from the right, i.e. he'd shoot  directly in front of the corner of the box instead of coming across to in front of the goal as his traditional left winger training entails.

People give him a lot of stick for his performances on the right because of the shot frequency, but I think there were a variety of factors underlying this, including psychological and tactical (such as almost always being double-teamed on the right due to his threat and our lack of creativity on the ground). These shots also established an illusion that he was more predictable on the right, when in reality he actually created more problems with the unpredictability because the defenders were constantly thinking he was ready to shoot (hence him always being double-teamed while playing right). On the left however, his movement was very much along perpendicular lines to the byline or across to shoot, with hardly anything in between despite usually only facing one defender.""

I think Townsend does provide decent enough cover, but I think he'd be far happier on the right (it's that work indeed that got him his England callups after all) and he'd excel in Poch's system on that side sharing time with Lamela playing in a role similar to Rodriguez' at Saints, and especially since he'd be propped up by the pace and athleticism of Walker (as Rodriguez was with Shaw on the left).",0,1401465366,null,0,false,0,chuxhtq,t3_26tr0j,t1_chuxhtq,t1_chuw1xh,null,1434020555,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Not quite. The chassis, the motherboard, the batteries are all bespoke. Talking of batteries, they use Lithium Polymer ones which are still expected to have 80% capacity after 1,000 charge cycle whereas your typical PC World laptop will be lucky to have a battery with 80% capacity a year and a couple of hundred charge cycles later. 

The cable strain relief and routing mechanisms used in a Macbook Pro are all aluminium whereas in other laptops they're usually plastic pegs. Even the charge socket is of a type that will never suffer the same issues as a typical Windows laptop.

Unless you've opened up laptops and macbook pros and actually examined how they're put together, you won't see the true differences.

&gt; Getting an equivalent spec laptop to a macbook air can be done far cheaper that buying a macbook air.

I'm not just talking about the CPU, memory and HDD but the build quality and everything that goes into making them more durable.

I've refurbished and repaired thousands of laptops and as I said, you've got to look at the top end business range from Dell, Lenovo and HP to find comparable build quality.

&gt;

&gt;The __European Rail Traffic Management System__ (ERTMS) is an initiative backed by the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) to enhance cross-border interoperability and the procurement of [signalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_signal) equipment by creating a single Europe-wide standard for train control and command systems.

&gt;The two main components of ERTMS are the [European Train Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System) (ETCS), a standard for in-cab train control, and [GSM-R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM-R), the GSM mobile communications standard for railway operations.  The equipment can further be subdivided between on-board and infrastructure equipment.

Easy to customise your hardware spec, chose your deisred OS, and it comes as a bare OS, freshly installed, no extra junk.

I found that I could also afford a much higher spec device compared to the big brand names too. Got a boat load of extra RAM, a nice slick i5 processor, and a speedy SSD as the main OS drive. Cost about £450 from them, and a similarly spec'd model from PC World was about £800.

You can save yourself even more money too by electing to avoid the Windows Tax, which is applied to everything you get on the highstreet. Plenty of highly functional and user friendly open source operating systems out there (I like Linux Mint), and/or plenty of ways of getting hold of a copy of Windows should you absolutely need it.

If they buy Shaw that will suck, I would prefer he either stay with the Saints or come our way. That still leaves around 90 mil to fix their defensive issues and strengthen their mid field. 

As far as our window, I don't want to see older players coming in, like Lavezzi. I would hope Jose is eyeing the future not the present. He needs to build a solid squad, one with out the striker rotating every year. 

I also would prefer Balotelli over Costa. Costa is a questionable purchase and I am afraid he will flop in the PL. Balotelli at least has the experience to face the tougher defense the league has. I wouldnt say the Champions league is the greatest judgment on the leagues defense. Costa seemed a bit off against our defense, arguably the best in the league, but everyone will be building a strong back line this season.

There were members of the Khmer Rouge who were still serving in the Cambodian government until the mid-90's, a decade and a half after [their crimes became more widely famous.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_Fields_\(film\)) These guys were given pardons and exonerations by their own nation, only for justice to catch up with them in the last 5 years or so, now they're in their 80s.

Blair knows better than anyone how fickle justice, and the tides of history, can be.

Blair is only 61 now, so he's got another 25 years until he's as old as [Nuon Chea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuon_Chea) - I'm not saying his crimes are comparable, but 25 years is a heck of a long time in politics, and you never know when we might need to placate the middle east (or [Africa](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/sudan/1305028/international-criminal-court-african-union-racist-ethiopia-sudan-kenya-commentary)), or make an example about international justice.

There's a big bit of me that says none of this is even realistic - and I appreciate it maybe seems a bit wild of me to take my inspiration from the Khmer Rouge - but at the same time I do wonder if it's enough to get in his head and give Blair sleepless nights.

No where did I say this, in fact today, without doubt, Islam is responsible for more acts of terrorism than any other religion. I think you'd agree with me on that point.

However, what I took issue with was this:
&gt;Islam is not a peaceful ideology

He blamed Islam itself, as if it were somehow uniquely more dangerous religion rather than any other mainstream religion. This patently wrong, as Islamic extremism was almost unheard of before the 1980s. Sure Islamists existed, like the muslim brotherhood, but they were largely irrelevant, and non-violent anyway. To claim that Islam, the religion itself is the problem, you have to ignore hundreds of years of history.

I've explained why I think it multiple times, citing the difference in your original, outrageous, unpopular claim and the [goalpost shifted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts) comment I replied to, your lack of other explanation or correction for the shift etc. 'I thought' was an attempt at polite phrasing that has obviously been wasted on you. You did it, you know you did it, you were trolling people then and you've been trolling me ever since, scatter-shot arguing about anything you possibly can in my posts because I happened to call you on it. I really should've known not to engage you when you didn't hold your hands up in that very first reply. 

Disagreeing with the DUP does not fit [this](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/self-righteous) definition of self-righteous, nor [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-righteousness) one, [this](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/self-righteous). You might just be able to stretch it to the simplified version of [this](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/self-righteous) definition, but not the expanded one. I didn't take offence at any of them, or your usage, either. I called you on your attempts to make your ridiculous position look reasonable. Not sure if you're forgetting how this started or if it's just more convienient for you if you pretend I was angry about the wrong thing.

&gt;Sure why don't you tell me what you want me to think and save any more bother?

Lastly, a [value judgement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_judgment) is just that - a judgement about values. It would only become self-righteous (in standard definition) with the addition of the smug/pious/extreme assurance that is common to usage of the term 'self-righteous'. If you want to use the two terms interchangably, go for it - there's nothing inherent in the laws of the universe saying the noise/letters that make up the term 'self-righteous' have to refer to what they commonly do, but why bother? Words and terms are just labels; so long as we know what we're using them to refer to it's grand, so using them in a deliberately non-standard way is poor communication.

Unless you've been scrambling around on a website lashing out at random bits of people's posts to cover up the fact that you said something silly and are just digging yourself in deeper rather than admit any fault, error or ignorance.

true,B4mf0rth,null,null,"&gt; The rate of technological progress is increasing exponentially which makes all that historical evidence worthless. You can call this speculation as much as you want but that just shows how technologically ignorant you are.

Historical evidence, while not perfect evidence, is the best evidence we have got to show underlying trends. We can use it to make a small test for your speculation. 

If you are correct, then in the last hundred years of technological acceleration, we should be seeing a increase in unemployment that matches the acceleration. 

But... duh duh duuuhh... we aren't.

The rate of technological progress is improving exponentially at the moment, but it also has done for the past 100 years. Which makes the last hundred years of historical data quite valuable. It can't definitively prove anything, but it should give us a general idea. 

But it doesn't show anything at all, it pretty much shows the same, and with the 1920's pushing up the average for the first half of the century, it actually shows a slight overall fall. 

So what what you are saying isn't backed up by any facts, any evidence, any support of any kind. 

What you are doing therefore is guessing. Speculating. Making it up. Because you can't see what jobs we will be doing in the future (just like in the 1930's, people didn't foresee computers), you are assuming there will be no jobs. Basically you are (quite arrogantly) assuming that you are supremely intelligent, and so if you can't work out what the job markets will be in 50 years time, it necessarily means there won't be any. 

You ask me ""what will happen to all the unemployed drivers when driverless vehicles become mainstream?""?

I don't know. I don't even pretend to know. I'm giving exactly the same answer that a person in 1955 would have said if you asked them what would happen to all the car manufacturing workers when the factory lines became automated. They wouldn't know then, and I don't know now. But I do know that from the unemployment statistics, that those car factory workers have got other jobs, and the proportion of unemployed has not increased over time. 

So until there is sufficient evidence for this idea that we are heading towards mass unemployment, or in fact any evidence at all, I'm not buying it. It remains as valid as the idea that everyone on the planet's genitals are going to turn into diamond tomorrow afternoon at 4:12pm. You may as well be spouting that kind of crap, as it is as valid.

&gt; The Green party has been around for ages, but it hasn't had a dramatic increase in support like UKIP.

&gt; UKIP created news and it got reported on.

I disagree somewhat. I think the media has *created* the story - or at least encouraged it - rather than UKIP achieving success on its own. The rise of UKIP is partly due to the insane levels of media coverage its enjoyed (negative publicity is still publicity). This isn't some kind of conspiracy, it's simply because the media likes a good story. Farage practically lives at the BBC these days, saying controversial things.

Whilst it's undeniable that UKIP did do very well, and their policies are popular with a lot of people, the ""political earthquake"" has been overstated. There's this idea that the entirety of the UK has turned to UKIP and shunned the ""political class"". 27.5% of the vote is significant, but it's not everyone. **Only 9.3% of the electorate actually voted for UKIP** last Thursday, if you take into account the low turnout. Consider that UKIP has mobilised their voter base *much* more effectively than any other party has.

TLDR; UKIP should be receiving lots of coverage and they have been successful, but the media is partly responsible for their rise.

true,Chrisischan,flair8,,"His finishing from the LW given our circumstances which was the result of slow, horizontal, and meandering central midfield play that forced each of our wingers to be isolated. When he had space against Benfica and has the time to directly take on defenders, he showed exactly what he can do and that he knows exactly where the goal is. Doesn't matter a thing if he's aware of it if there's three bodies in between him and a shot, as was often the case. 

To each their own, but I don't feel Chadli and a Townsend who quite clearly prefers the right is sufficient if we're to build upon Poch's system, and that's also partially for this topic at hand pertaining to the left back. Konoplyanka is ambidextrous and quick-footed to create problems from any angle, pacy enough to find space, and due to being originally a deep-lying playmaker at Dnipro he's situationally aware enough to not only come in and build the attack and find the incisive pass but also to know when the situation in the middle and defending third merits him getting back. This awareness coupled with his pace is extremely advantageous in his support of the fullback, and the defense in general. 

If you look at Poch's lopsided 4-2-3-1 pressing system, Kono on one side helping out Rose/new LB is very supportive of the other side consisting of an experienced and athletic Walker propping up Lamela or Townsend playing almost parallel with the striker. This setup, along with Eriksen in the middle, would create all kinds of problems for defenders between the unpredictability, options available, and pace at hand.

If by that, you mean he deserves minutes coming off the bench and as a rotation player with Liverpool, yes... that is my stance on the role he should have.  However, saying he deserves playing time isn't the same as saying he deserves to be starting and therefore would be looking to leave.

Borini has not performed as well as Shaqiri just because of his one year of good performances and he hasn't done it at Liverpool, which is key.

You'll note that Shaw's average heat maps are still very high and almost up with Rodriguez' in fact. This is very similar to the manner in which Walker has played very high, and very close to his RW. Therefore, I think it much more likely that Lamela/Townsend will be seen as the Rodriguez type ahead of Walker, and another option on the left ahead of Rose/new LB hopefully familiar with Biesla as of this fall playing in a role similar to Ward-Prowse, with the additional benefit (re:Kono) of cutting across and creating thereby fulfilling the perks to Lallana playing out left when he was called to do so.

He's very good at helping out his fullback in coverage, and very, very good at attacking space, but he's not the type to cut across and create in tight places as players such as Kono and Depay are. That's no sleight to Chadli, his perks are just elsewhere. 

But my advocacy for Kono is as above that I think he'd be possibly even better at helping out our left back issue, could fulfill some of Lallana's best traits by cutting across and creating, and doesn't sacrifice much if at all in attack. More than anything, he's simply another option, and the option I think would immediately work the best in Poch's system.

I think that it being government fits the facts better, but its complicated and difficult to prove and I don't know if I'm up to it.

If you want to know you should look into it, see the unanimous story from all the papers and broadcasters, Edinburgh based grassroots campaign, search elsewhere and find its run by a London based PR company, with a Tory donor boss, and a history of working for governments. They've been secretly preparing since the referendum was announced, then launched in a blaze of misleading publicity, and are spending vast amounts on spreading blatant lies. 10 mins online would have told them Scotland has a separate NHS now, already has a system in place to pay the English NHS and vice versa. Over 2 years and £235000+ raised and no one did that? The rest of their output is just as bad, so I'd say they are definitely trying to deceive and manipulate voters. 

Would some PR guy have the pull to get his little hobby on every news programme on every BBC radio station and TV station? Had radio1 on at work, 18 sections just from that, on BBC and ITV news and BBC 3 news over 2-3 days, and that's only the ones I saw. Not one journalist thought to look into it, even enough to find out they were London based not the Scottish grassroots they claimed, and these are journalists? Not plausible to me, and it would mean we have to fire everyone in media for being incompetent. If not then its someone with an agenda rather than news reporting, and who could wield that kind of power if its not government?

How on Earth is that woman-empowering?)

Also, I just looked through the list of episodes which allegedly fail the test and found loads of mistakes. The Eleventh Hour passes the Bechdel test, Amy has a quick talk with the old lady in that. The Lodger has Sophie talking to the little girl from upstairs (although this might be up for discussion because the little girl is really a genderless alien). In Closing Time, Madame Kovarian has a lengthy talk with River and although they do talk about the Doctor, Kovarian also talk about a song, River's promotion and River's identity. Let's Kill Hitler is the most obvious wrong one, not only because it features lengthy flashbacks about the relationship between Mels and Amy, talking about all kinds of stuff. In The Wedding of River Song, Amy talks to Madam Kovarian about River and Kovarian begs Amy to let her go. That is an a-grade pass, I'm sorry. And in Asylum of the Daleks, Amy chats with her make-up lady about, you know, make-up. All those episodes are listed as ""don't pass the test"".

At the same time, apparently Dalek passes the test whose only scene which comes close to a dialogue between two females is between Rose and one of the military women who is basically only talking to Adam. Rose says one sentence to her. So that passes, but Closing Time and Let's Kill Hitler don't.

The plan is to build up UKIP and Farage-as-personality, then once they've built up a head of steam knock them down and laud this as a return to two party politics and a rejection of the radical fringe ""both left and right"".  Then in effect the mass media will have moved public discourse to the right while ignoring the Greens (ie. the left), without having ever given their arguments a fair hearing.  The reason is blindingly obvious.  Even Britons who consider themselves on the right have been shown to actually support key left wing policies like renationalisation of utilities and the protection of the NHS.  Those who fund newspapers and pony up cash for the farce of British parliamentary democracy to be put on, represent the capitalist class that opposes such policies.

&gt;

&gt;The __Bechdel test__ (/ˈbɛkdəl/ *__BEK__-dəl*) asks whether a work of [fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction) features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. The requirement that the two women must be named is sometimes added. Many contemporary works fail this test of [gender bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_bias). On average, films that pass the test have been found to have a lower budget than others, but of comparable or better financial performance.

&gt;The test is named after the American cartoonist [Alison Bechdel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Bechdel). In 1985, she had a character in her comic strip *[Dykes to Watch Out For](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dykes_to_Watch_Out_For)* voice the idea, which she attributed to a friend, Liz Wallace. The test was originally conceived for evaluating films but has since been applied to other media. It is also known as the __Bechdel/Wallace test__,  the __Bechdel rule__,  __Bechdel's law__,  or the __Mo Movie Measure__.

Take Amy for example. You're travelling with the Doctor and your fiance/husband.

It also doesn't mean everything in her life revolves entirely around the main character either. (in fact, it revolved around it a lot less than some other companions) 

The bechdel test is okay for long(ish) movies, but for series that need to cram entire stories in less than an hour it's a poor choice.

Sacked? What the fuck is employers problems these days... 

&gt; (who groaned?)

Me. Chu gon' do about it foo'?

&gt; Now being sacked may, to some people, appear to be a negative and they may feel quite low. Those people clearly haven't worked with a bunch of bellends for £99 a week in a woeful house in a woeful city. It's in this context that I am happy, because this has opened my options up and I feel that getting sacked has done more for me personally than staying in the job. Certainly more for my prospects too! Because it's lit a fire. There have been countless situations in my life when I, sometimes for better, mostly for the worst, have gritted my teeth and learnt to make do. Not again!

...That's good to hear dude. There are plenty of us fuckers around who are helpful with CV's, Training, advice and general fuckwittery and good mannered comments should you need it eh?

&gt; The reason is I have a bloody great sister who lives in the South (nobody's perfect, I suppose) and I rang her up to explain I'd been sacked, pitching myself that I've been unemployed in Bradford before and it's a dead-end, I'd already looked at Colchester and opportunities were practically overflowing, so would I be able to stay with her whilst I find my feet. She, as you've maybe guessed, agreed because as mentioned before she's bloody great. So one door's shut, but it's a door to a manky hovel full of needles and dry-rot, subsidence and hookers, and the new door's opened. This door's got a pane of glass in and everything.

Sudden way-hey! 

Sounds like the weeks been up and down for you in a few respects dude. Glad you're storming out of it with your head held high eh?

He isn't going to develop with us next season because he is barely going to play. So, we would probably just have to loan him out again. Every year we wait for him to ""break out"" can potentially cost us huge money.

It quite misfired as Putin was showing his teeth but to be frank, I think it's a lot better for Ukrainians to lose that Crimea and even few parts of Eastern country and join the West then remain in connection with Russian state.

Why people moan about the EU, especially from richest EU countries? It's because they have more money, so need to share it with the rest of the EU to level all up. I think it's much better though, especially that the EU has direct control, rather than for example foreign aid which is often misused. EU money also isn't something like ""free money"" to citizens of new EU countries. Regulations are very strict and they focus on improvement or innovation etc.

true,benevolence,null,null,"I think that for next season that our number one striker will be Adebayor and while his wages for this year are astronomical, for me this year his work rate and attitude have matched his goals. 
He's a proven goalscorer in the premier league, while Soldado sadly has failed to live up to his reputation thus far. I also think that Ade has had some impact on Kane's game, there were just little movements and touches that he made towards the end of the season that were reminiscent of Ade for sure. I don't know whether we would want to play Soldado up front on his own anymore either, his game when he is facing his own goal or with long balls just hasn't had an impact. I'd think if we were going to try and play him into form, it would make the most sense to try and do this as a striker pairing, to offset the pressure and give him someone to play off.
For me I want a player brought into to complement and compete with our existing strikers for next season, rather than to replace any of them. A new player even from within the league may not settle, so it would make sense to keep our most prolific striker. As we all know it's taken many great players time to get to grips with playing in England, so we should also by that logic give Soldado a second season. We could do that for the year, letting Ade leave on a free at the en, be in a position to make a judgement on Soldado and having got the difficult debut season out of the way for a new siging.
I could in fairness see both of them leaving. If someone wants to match Levy's down payment on Soldado, I think he'll move on and if there's somewhere out there that wants to pay Ade that crazy money he will be off too, for a nominal fee.

At the same time, given the right team, Stevie knows how to keep it simple. Just watch him today. No one is coming to recieve the ball, so stevie has been forced to try a few long balls. If Busquets were under similar circumstances, he would be struggling to effectively get the ball out of the half.

For the lipstick to look truer to life in the bullet on your lips, you will want a lip liner. One that is a neutral tone that is similar to your lip colour. A pretty good universal one is the No7 liner in Nude. You don't always need to match the liner to the lipstick but one that would help cancel out pigmentation on your lips will help. No7 are my favourites to use but have a play around with brands. We're lucky to have testers to swatch.

My favourite lipsticks are:

* Soap &amp; Glory mattes - Pom Pom is a lovely pink shade   
* No7 Stay Perfect - Classic Rose is a universal colour.  
* NARS Satin pencil - Luxembourg is called a watermelon shade but it's a pinky red that's longwearing. - I'd try the NARS matte pencil line too if you have a counter near you.  
* Givenche Le Rouge - Satin formua so not quite totally matte but they last a while. There's a wide selection of pinks, reds, plummy reds and a few nudes. 
* Urban Decay - Their revolution lipsticks are bloody brilliant and especially for the price of £15. There's about 23 shades or so to choose from. A good nude in the line is Naked. Naked 2 might work depending on your colouring. Fiend is a favourite pink of mine from them but it's a duskier pink. Their brightest pink is Catfight which is BRIGHT. Google up some swatches :)  

I've also been really impressed by the Bourjois Rouge Edition Velvet line. There's a nude shade but it seems to be very.co.uk exclusive.

There were reports that the DfT were wavering on it but I think it's in both the interim agreement that First have signed, and it will be in the franchise agreement next time regardless of who wins. It's too politicially important, does have benefits for the economy, and won't be replaced unless you can do Penzance to London in 3 hours or less, or something like that.

I believe First has even committed to a refurbishment of the Night Riviera + some new carriages to extend the service a bit. I have never done the sleeper, and I have an enormous excuse to (I commute to/from Reading once a week) but don't know if I should wait for the refurbishment before giving it a go.

&gt; Do Bombardier even have a platform they could use to build a locomotive hauled carriage now?

No idea tbh, but who said practicality had to get in the way of a good whinge? :)

&gt; Perhaps if Alstom hadn't made such a mess of the Class 458 / 175 / 180 fleets when they were introduced, they could be using the intermediate carriages 

Indeed, the 180 would not be the best starting point for a new train :) Does Alstom have any works here still or would it be shipped out to France? I thought it was really just Bombardier and Hitachi now.

&gt; EDIT: CAF seem to be one of the few companies still building loco-hauled stock, they are doing a few hundred new passenger cars for Amtrak in the USA at the moment.

true,vzzzbux,null,null,"&gt;  I still don't understand why Bristol - Exeter cannot be electrified if Dawlish is the problem area - it's further west of Exeter anyway. Getting the wires to Exeter would help the case for an inland route to Plymouth. Then the Dawlish route can be left for local and tourist services.

It's a shambles that even London to Bristol was forgotten about until 2013/4. I wonder if BR would have done it in the 90s had they not been privatised and not run on minimal investment prior to that? We should really be at the point where it's places like Cornwall on the radar for electrification, not major cities.

I guess to do Bristol to Exeter you'd reasonably have to do Exeter to Reading via Westbury/Newbury too otherwise you'd lose the more direct route under normal conditions and then be reliant on a single line. Not always the best idea as we have found out this year..

I can imagine that if Exeter was ever done, Plymouth wouldn't find it trivial to get the government to extend it there too, compared to the relative ease that the Welsh Assembly seemed to get it extended to Swansea with relatively little whining. It really should be Plymouth minimum, Penzance ideally (you're going to need to do it eventually, so why not do it all now, and it avoids a need for bi-mode trains or keeping a fleet of stodgy old HSTs just for Cornwall)

&gt; I am waiting to see the fallout when Network Rail finally have to resignal the Shrewsbury area. On the one hand semaphore signals are part of our railway heritage, but then again there's no excuse why every line in the country shouldn't have had colour light signalling installed years ago.

I think that we shouldn't be using the commercial railway as an operating rail museum. If a few people still want old signalling, then let them take the bits away and use it on the heritage/volunteer railways. I totally agree, there's no excuse why the entire country isn't on it. But we see the same old places being resignalled time and time again while places like Cornwall get overlooked. Cornwall is a bit of an odd case anyway, you have ancient mechanical signalling bounded by islands of solid state interlocking (the former area served by Bodmin signal box, now controlled by a panel in Lostwithiel). If GSM-R wasn't forced on the South of England by international agreement we'd probably be waiting decades for that too.

&gt; I suspect that is down to Network Rail defining Wales as a single region now (they have done the same with Scotland too).
&gt; Neither really make much sense because of the majority of cross-border traffic to and from England.

Having a devolved government probably helps enormously too. It's fine to put signallers out of work in SW England unless they want to move to Oxfordshire, but not in Cardiff apparently.

&gt; I think centralising things to 12 or so massive ""operations centres"" will also lose a lot of local knowledge. People in Plymouth will have a better idea of their local geography than people in Bristol after all.

Agreed. Bristol isn't really local for people down here. I just picked Taunton because IIRC it's the where Exeter ends and Westbury takes over.

&gt; The Wales centre will handle some cross-border routes like Wrexham - Shrewsbury - Hereford - Newport, yet my local line of Wrexham - Bidston will apparently come under the control of Manchester!

It'd be nice to know how NR decide these things. Surely if you're going to go to the trouble to build a centre in Wales, and the technology doesn't really have a distance limit anymore, you might as well have the whole of Wales being run from it?

The other half is available in individual DVD releases: The Keys of Marinus, The Aztecs (also available in a special edition with better restoration and more special features), The Sensorites, and The Reign of Terror (with the two missing episodes reconstructed with newly commissioned animation).

However a lot of people come and go before you even get to know their name.

Your average UKIP voter is **really** pissed off with the 'established' parties; they've *actively* decided to support the 'outsiders'; and they're also older than your average voter - and old people vote in larger numbers than young people.

true,Quazz,capaldi,Capaldi,"The main thing that needs to be worked out for a Doctor Who RPG isn't really the story, you could come up with any story and it would probably work.

The more important part is game design and how  certain interactions work and what not. 

You need a certain amount of freedom, but also direction. Something like the Fallout or Elder Scroll series perhaps, but maybe smaller open worlds, but simply more of them (different planets and what not) and obviously some time travel needs to be involved and any move made in an earlier point needs to be reflected in the future point. 

You also need to break up the main story line in a series of ""mini quests"" as it were in order to give the players a break in between moves and allow them to explore and investigate. 

Multiplayer would be nice for Doctor Who, but unfortunately the balance of power would never really be great. You have the Doctor and then River is kind of equals, but then almost everyone else is severely more limited in what they can do. Nevertheless, you can sort of force them to work together, kind of like in the Eternity Clock, except without the whole puzzle mini games. I'd rather have the platform puzzles of the Adventure Games. 

I'm not sure the Sonic should get the healing ability, personally. And if it does, then the Sonic needs a battery life that you need to refill. The Doctor is a doctor after all, I'm sure you can work in some other way to heal people up. 

I'm not sure about being able to take multiple hits from Daleks and what not. Maybe simply not die instantly but delayed which would be more true to the show. The Doctor isn't really one for hand to hand combat (except for a few incarnations) or similar, even if he does kill. 

Perhaps have some warning system similar to Deus Ex or even Watchdogs where they aren't on red alert they won't shoot on sight, but you can instead open dialogue and attempt to talk your way out of it cleverly or perhaps even defeat them somehow. Of course, the problem with that is, you can't make it repetitive or predictable because then it can be gamed.

I think his attitude has been brilliant as well. I remember in the game against Watford in the FA Cup when the Etihad was absolutely freezing he seemed to be the only player on the pitch who actually gave a shit. Whenever he picked up the ball he'd do something, whether it be running down the wing or driving across the field to free up space for someone else. Whilst players like Richards and Dzeko were sulking around Navas was putting them to shame with his commitment and effort.

Agreed, but let's be honest, Bobby didn't win a single header all season. He doesn't have the work rate of say....Saurez...who is also small, but fights to get body position to win positioning on long balls from bigger CBs. 

I don't think this point can be harped on enough. The EPL is made up of squads full of strength and size, it's the trend moving forward. When Harry got a shot towards the end, we scored plenty of goals off of semi-hopeful long balls, because he stuck his neck in there and won 'em.

Bobby played a 4231 at Valencia (favored by AVB and Poch), a style which he thrived in because of the service he received.

Why? It favours those willing to break the law over those who are the true victims of repression in foreign countries. It also punishes the citizens of the invaded country by lowering living standards and importing attitudes from war-torn nations.

I do favour intervention in foreign countries to support and protect all those affected by human rights tragedies. Military intervention to defeat corrupt and abusive military. Engineering to assist with infrastructural supplies (water supply, power). Education to assist with the economy (farming techniques).

The half-assed approach - granting refugee status to a limited few - is highly discriminatory and a moral hazard (rewards the wrong behaviour). It lets us con ourselves into thinking we've helped - when really we've just ignored the majority that are suffering.

Additionally, Roger Helmer (now the MEP for East Midlands!) made [this](http://rogerhelmermep.wordpress.com/2011/05/22/ken-on-rape-badly-phrased-but-basically-right/) appalling blog post about rape back in 2011, saying the following:

&gt;Imagine that a woman voluntarily goes to her boyfriend’s apartment, voluntarily goes into the bedroom, voluntarily undresses and gets into bed, perhaps anticipating sex, or naïvely expecting merely a cuddle.  But at the last minute she gets cold feet and says “Stop!”.  The young man, in the heat of the moment, is unable to restrain himself and carries on.

*""'Unable to restrain himself'?""* I might hear you exclaim. ""What the *fuck,* Helmer?""

He goes on to say:

&gt;the victim surely shares a part of the responsibility, if only for establishing reasonable expectations in her boyfriend’s mind.

If you're having sex or about to have sex with someone and they say ""stop"" then you bloody well stop. *No matter what.* If you then carry on anyway, that is on you, and you *alone.*

Take this example: A British citizen living in the US with their US spouse. Under the current rules, they would not both be able to immediately move back to the UK. The UK citizen would have to move first, find a job earning above £18600 pa, then keep that job for six months before even being allowed to apply to have their spouse join them. Even if it took only a month to get a job, that is seven months before being able to apply, then say, a month for processing. In that case, they would be separated for eight months. Is that fair? Most people don't want to be separated from their families for that long, and thus are put in a position of choosing between their families and their country. Or risk damage to their relationship. As such, many British people are in what is essentially a form of exile.  ",0,1401489799,null,0,false,0,chv8hp5,t3_26mxgd,t1_chv8hp5,t1_chuzgt8,null,1434025921,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

&gt;The __Gloster Meteor__ was the first British [jet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft) [fighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft) and the [Allies'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) first operational [jet aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft) during the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War). The Meteor's development was heavily reliant on its ground-breaking [turbojet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbojet) engines, pioneered by Sir [Frank Whittle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Whittle) and his company, [Power Jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Jets) Ltd. Development of the aircraft itself began in 1940, although work on the engines had been underway since 1936. The Meteor first flew in 1943 and commenced operations on 27 July 1944 with [No. 616 Squadron RAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._616_Squadron_RAF). Nicknamed the ""Meatbox"", the Meteor was not a sophisticated aircraft in terms of its aerodynamics, but proved to be a successful combat fighter.

So we partitioned Ireland and kept the North as part of the Empire. It remains in our grasp today, much to its detriment.

&gt;Here's a quick list of facts about that ""study"": They didn't count these episodes as passing the Bechdel test: 

&gt;- The Eleventh Hour

&gt;- The Wedding of River Song 

&gt;- Asylum of the Daleks

&gt;- Let's Kill Hitler

&gt;Those (and arguably The Lodger, Day of the Moon and Closing Time) all pass the Bechdel test, but were not counted. But you know what was counted? Dalek. Which doesn't have a single dialogue exchange between two women at all. 

&gt;They also stopped analysing once Clara came along, because since then only two episodes didn't pass with flying colours, one of them because it was set on a Russian submarine in the Cold War and the other one because there were only three supporting characters, all of whom were brothers. 

&gt;What do we learn from this? The study (which was pushed into publicity by the Guardian, for god's sake) is incredibly biased, wrong and should be spat at.

I know this, but it's not really relevant to the points I've been making. My point is that it was a major injustice that Britain held on to the six counties in the first place, and it is my hope that this historic injustice will be righted and Ireland reunited.

The vast, vast majority if criminologists agree there needs to be a softer, more restorative approach. They are blatantly ignored.

It's incredibly difficult to implement this when the DailyFuckingMail keeps stirring up public opinion by writing an article on *every single case* where a judge hands out a ridiculously lenient punishment. Anytime [Restorative Justice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice) is used, the DailyMail writes an article about how a the criminal got away with his crime by 'saying sorry'. They fail to mention how restorative justice dramatically reduces re-offending rates among the youth, mixed in a a whole host of other benefits. One of these news articles can have more influence on policy than a decade of study by a gifted academic.

The fear mongering bastards and some idiot politicians are *attempting to imitate the American system of punishment*; the country with the highest incarceration rates in the world (by a mile) and arguably the highest violent crime rate in the western world. It makes me so fucking furious. Anyone with an ounce of sense would do the exact opposite. 

Even in the Scandinavian countries, with the lowest crime rates and lowest re-offending rates (due to social equality and a fair, non-vindictive justice system) right-wing politicians are calling for a tougher, more American-style stance in order to pander votes from idiots who *refuse* to realize how well their system is working. The same thing is happening worldwide and will accelerate with the emergence of the extreme eight in the E.U. 

'Tough stance on crime' is one of the best ways to obtain votes but the spread of misinformation and right-wing rhetoric is making it incredibly difficult to develop effective crime prevention policies. We have had centuries of 'I'm the man who will be tough on crime', but being tough has never really led to any long term drops but it does cost a fuckton of money. This is one of the areas where Politicians need to do the respectable thing and not comment on an issue they know nothing about. Leave it too the experts, it's costing too many lives and too much money. If UKIP gain more power, we are screwed. Their crime policy is fucking draconian.

Also don't forget Bentaleb's passing ability which was on show this year.

Though i think a Sandro-Paulinho midfield would be weak in passing ability, a Capoue-Paulinho, Sandro-Bentaleb, or a Capoue-Dembele midfield would all be workable.

Also, I'm curious to see in what position Eriksen will be played (as it think it is less obvious that he will take up the 10 position due to his inferior defensive workrate). I can definitely see him being used as a sort of wide playmaker (Lallana, Cazorla) nominally off of the left wing with Holtby, Siggy or even Chadli being the most advanced midfielder.

true,Chrisischan,flair8,,"I completely agree with you on Capoue's passing ability, we've yet to fully experience here in his time at Spurs but he has shown an unusually clever knack for finding an ideal pass and releasing quickly for a No 6. 

However, I do think we could use someone a bit quicker and more mobile to be this ""passer from deep,"" the DLP to replace Modric. Capoue going far enough forward that would merit him being a true replacement of the mold is a bit risky in Poch's wingback system, so I'd like to see Capoue hold a bit more reserved and function more like Schneiderlin did for Saints. If Capoue can buckle down and get some of Schneiderlin's workmanlike effort, he could be absolutely essential within Poch's plans for next year. Either way, he's the starter for me in the CDM position next year for his better pace, quicker release, and more incisive passing.

On Eriksen though, wingers have quite a bit more defensive responsibility than the classic No 10 position, and especially in Poch's system. If we want to alleviate Eriksen of defensive responsibility to prop up the attacking three, as we should, then he does need to be playing his natural position. I think Poch will be very excited to work with Eriksen in such a role, and was likely along with Lamela as one of the two talents at the forefront of his mind when applying for the job.

true,lofty29,null,null,"I think that the traditional British reserve negates a lot of these issues outside of UK major cities. Men will stare and talk amongst themselves, but rarely do I see any attempt to communicate with passing women. Obviously this is exacerbated in pubs, bars and so-on where both parties are drinking or drunk, but to some extent isn't that the point of those establishments?

From my experience of London - and those of others who have either lived there for a short while or visited - it's much more prominent. Again, British reserve keeps most from actually saying anything, but the glares that women get on the tube, busses, and from passers-by, are pretty hard not to notice.

I was going to make a comment on the ethnicity of the groups that I've most often heard implicated in this type of behaviour, and some spiel about how some circles have yet to adjust to social norms over here, but really it's pointless to make that comparison. It can't be understated that there are people like this in every walk of life. Many, many of my 18 - 24 white British acquaintances have warped views toward women - the whole 'lad' mentality doesn't help at all. 

Obviously, most people (British or otherwise) who are part of these kinds of groups are unlikely to go so far as to grope a girl in the street. However I don't think it's unfair to say that a whole lot of young men see women as a goal; while they may not be so inconsiderate as to treat a woman like a piece of property, there is definitely a mentality within these groups that women are achievements rather than people.",0,1401509914,null,0,false,0,chvg8bg,t3_26xht3,t1_chvg8bg,t3_26xht3,null,1434029633,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

The show is about The Doctor's adventures, it is not about what the other characters do when he isn't around *except* when that is used to set the scene for his arrival. 

River Song, for instance, apparently has all kinds of adventures on her own that have nothing to do with the Doctor.

I'm not talking about shows that have an ensemble cast. If we said ""protagonists don't count"", then the number of shows and movies that pass the Bechdel test would drop even lower than they're at.

The fact that the Doctor is a ""male"" character (despite being an alien) is part of what makes up the Bechdel test. The fact that the creators *chose* to make the protagonist a male, and the fact that Steven Moffat thinks this male character is the most interesting thing on the show and should be focused on at the loss of the female characters is what makes up the test. If post-RTD Doctor Who was the only show that failed the Bechdel test, than it wouldn't be a problem. But this isn't even the only show Moffat runs that has this problem. 

All the test is asking for right now is that women *talk* more often. It's not even bringing up things like how often Moffat's female characters are ""snarky flirts who are in love with the Doctor"".
