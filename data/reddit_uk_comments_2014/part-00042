Different ways of referring to this match:

 After Liverpool's destruction of Arsenal at home, and Manchester City once again dropped points away, it was Chelsea who climbed to the summit, as Eden Hazard smashed a Premier League hat-trick for his club Week 25 of the English Premier League season saw a shakeup at the top, with Chelsea overtaking Arsenal at the top.
Week 26 sees the English domestic league tackle a set of midweek evening fixtures and the extreme weather that has swept the country. The tie of the round is no doubt being contested at the Emirates, as Arsenal face the champions, Manchester United.

The reality is though that Gerrard is going to play almost every game (barring injury/fitness) and Lucas and Gerrard simply shouldn't be playing at the same time as we are far better with only one of them in our midfield.  Gerrard simply runs out of gas trying to do too much work and Lucas doesn't have the stamina he used to pre-ACL injury.

The fact is though that Lucas is anywhere near as confident with his passing as Gerrard is though, you just don't see anything but fairly run of the mill passes from him.  Certainly none of the wonder-passes Gerrard and Coutinho often make.  While Gerrard isn't as good at tackling (although he is still very good), he offers a lot more creative flow from the back and with fitter midfielders effectively covering some ground for him we are able to really put on a lot of pressure.

Having imgur on the blacklist results in all of the load for a very popular site getting passed through a firewall that is normally only used for lower volume sites. The firewall needs to intercept every HTTP request, decode it, analyse the URL then decide whether or not to allow it. Reddit + imgur + IWF = slow as molasses firewall. Requests to other web hosts bypass the firewall, only ones to listed IPs get filtered. It's a good system for the requirements, provided that the firewall can handle the load. Which it can't.

Sol Campbell had his professional debut at Spurs. He became one of the best defenders in the league, the club captain and a fan favorite. However, Spurs were strictly a mid to lower table club at this stage, and, since his contract was running out, there was speculation he would move somewhere else to play Champions League football (there were rumors Inter and Arsenal were among the interested teams). 

Sol Campbell always denied these rumors, saying he was Spurs through and through and would never play for another club. He had also said many times that he would never play for Arsenal for any reason whatsoever, since that was something the fans wouldn't forgive him for.

He was offered a new contract which would have made him the highest paid player at the club. Publicly he said he was going to sign it, but he declined. At the end of the season, his contract ran out and he went to Arsenal on a free.

I think people would have understood him wanting to play at the Champions League, but not only did he go against his word, he left to his team's bitter rivals after waiting for his contract to run out so he could go *without Spurs being paid anything*, after getting the fans' loyalty by saying he was 100% a Tottenham man every time he opened his mouth.

Spurs don't look good. They've scraped a few wins but soon that new fresh manager smell with leave and the interior will stink like shit again. Newcastle are under pressure to win at the moment to stop their season from imploding. I don't see Spurs getting a win. 

At best we could end up six points clear of fifth tomorrow night. At worst we could be level with Spurs but ahead on goal difference. But I fully expect us to win tomorrow.

Here's where it gets sexy. Our next game after Fulham is Swansea at home. Guess who Everton play? They're away to Chelsea. If we beat Fulham and Swansea, and Everton lose, or even draw tomorrow, and inevitably lose to Chelsea, that's them done for fourth. We'll be nine points ahead. It's win win though. If Everton beat Chelsea, and we beat Fulham and Swansea, we'll only be a point behind Chelsea.

This is all if-buts-and-maybe-fucks, however I can't help but look at all the teams around us. 

I think this season will go to the wire. I'd love to have a nine point gap going into April. I just hope Spurs and Everton fuck up.",0,1392174035,null,0,false,0,cfd4lql,t3_1xnonp,t1_cfd4lql,t3_1xnonp,null,1432359144,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

I'm from southern California (Orange County), but just moved to south central Connecticut for my senior year to go to a school that has a very strong relationship with St Andrews.

My GPA is 4.2/3.8 (I think, it's an estimation because I stopped paying attention to it now).

My AP's were two during my sophomore year, 5 during junior, and 1 during senior.

ACT: 32, SAT I: 1960, SAT II: range from 650-800.

I will be studying Chemistry with Medicinal Chemistry.

Also I did two summers of study abroad in the south of England and was a semiprofessional dancer/actress while I lived in southern California and I have a strong background/intro to the medical field through familial connections.

Good luck!

At Centreback we can play JT, Luiz, Cahill and Ivanovic. At right back Ivanovic and Cesar. Left back Cesar and Cole. In the holding spots, Lampard, Mikel, Matic, Ramires, Luiz and even Oscar in a pinch. In the 3 attacking spots, there's Willian, Hazard, Oscar, Salah, Schurrle, Ramires, and possibly Eto'o. Obviously up front there's Eto'o, Torres, and Ba.

Compared to Arsenal and Liverpool, that's immense. Liverpool isn't in Europe, which is an advantage to them, but Arsenal are in a tough spot. Injury to Giroud would mean Bendtner leading the line... They're pretty stacked in the centre of midfield but beyond that they're weak and their players are brittle.

I wasn't planning on getting his signature tattooed, but I had to after he did it. I wanted something personal, something no one else had. And that's what I got. :)

I wish I could apologize to him by taking him by surprise with the hug (or scaring him), and to thank him for doing that for me. And also that I appreciate him so much for being so good to my mom and four year old son the next day. 

TL;DR: Matt Smith wrote his signature and Yowza on me and I got it tattooed and I gave him an awkward hug.",0,1392178496,null,0,false,0,cfd6k5s,t3_1xohv5,t1_cfd6k5s,t3_1xohv5,null,1432360134,18,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,18

I find most of the metro apps to be a bit pointless on a desktop and sticking some settings in the metro interface is a bit confusing - it's almost like some stuff is duplicated there and in control panel, while some things only seem to exist in the metro panel.  

You pretty quickly get used to using 8 very much like Vista or 7 on a desktop, not really sure about an actual tablet though.

true,Sparklesnap,flair4,,"1) No, because it's too easy to cut off our production from midfield, unless both Eriksen and Dembele are dropping very deep from their attacking positions, in which case Adebayor will be isolated; effectively in attack we have no way to transition the ball consistently, because ""just let Dembele dribble forward"" won't work every time. Without an effective way to transition from defense to attack and get the ball forward, your two CAMs will never get into the game in useful positions.

If Eriksen &amp; Dembele do drop deep, we'll see Sandro getting jumped in midfield. Pressing teams like Liverpool, Arsenal, and City would DESTROY this formation.

2) Knowing our Fullbacks like to overlap and get forward, we need midfielders who will stay back and defend... With this formation, we're effectively going to be defending with 5 or 6 players most of time, which may or may not even include Kyle and Danny. The rules of defending well as a team are simple; compress the space the other team has to play in, and then defend narrow; exactly what Everton did to us in the first half at the weekend; they forced us away from goal by playing narrow in the middle of the park, and then didn't try to defend everywhere at once. This formation is neither narrow nor compact in defense.

3) Dembele plays best when he has space to dribble into ahead of him. Playing him higher up the pitch limits this space.

I know everyone likes talking about formations, but at risk of sounding like a dick; please, put more thought and effort into it; try it out in Football Manager, or FIFA, or something. This has no chance of being a successful formation, offensively or defensively. There is a reason that people play ""true"" central midfielders in almost every formation out there; its because they're needed.

This last part is not directed at you specifically, but at the community in general; STOP WITH THIS SHIT. There is a reason that we are not managers; it is because we don't have the knowledge or the training to do so. If you want to talk formations and how we should be playing in THIS formation, not THAT one, Go get your UEFA licenses and post proof before you come in here with your 3-5-2s and your 4-1-2-2-1 garbage. Moreover, Tim Sherwood does not read our forum. If you want to manage spurs that badly, go get into a video game, but stop posting your fantasy formations here.

true,VaqueroGalactico,null,null,"I think the two main reasons we've been unexciting this season are:

* not enough runs being made
* slow tempo

Obviously these are not independent... if a player gets the ball in midfield, looks forward, can't find any positive options, and passes sideways, the tempo is naturally going to be slow. On the other hand, if a player makes a run but the passer doesn't look for him, he's probably not going to keep making the run that never gets spotted.

I think those two problems are more about the team's mentality and lack of familiarity with one another than the formation we're playing. Some of our games this season, particularly under AVB, remind me of watching Liverpool last year at times: slow, ponderous play, keeping possession, but a no cutting edge and not enough creativity.

Since you play FM, think about how this formation would play. Is this a counter attacking formation? There's not enough cover in deep areas to hold a defensive shape and try to counter attack through pace. Most teams defend with two banks of four (sometimes with an extra player between the lines) and a few teams get away with less, or press high up the pitch. Your formation would have us defend with 5, at best.

How about using this formation with a pressing style? I think this has a little more promise, it has a fairly natural press against a 4-2-3-1 (although one CB might go free), which is pretty common, but if Eriksen and Dembele are tasked with pressing high up the pitch and supporting Adebayor, then it will be difficult for us to get the ball up the field when we do regain possession.

Central midfield is hugely important to the way most teams play the game right now, and leaving this area relatively empty would make it too easy for teams to play around the front 5, leaving the back 5 defending alone.",0,1392182095,null,0,false,0,cfd80yh,t3_1xo71c,t1_cfd80yh,t3_1xo71c,null,1432360833,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Get yourself some tea. I love Yorkshire Gold, but unless you have Cost Plus World Market (or Amazon I guess) at your disposal, you can find PG Tips in most US chains in the tea section. 

Get yourself an electric kettle if you can find one-- I've seen some at Walmart for 15-20 bucks. It takes for damn ever to boil water with our voltage compared to the UK, but you can also get a stovetop tea kettle if that suits you too. 

Once you have boiling water, pour this into your mug with the tea bag. There's a lot of debate (that I've seen on here and while in England at least) about pouring the milk in before you pour in the water (to let the bag sit in the milk for a moment prior to the water being added to.. immerse it or something, I have no idea) or pouring the milk in last. I do the latter just because it works for me. After you let the tea steep for about 3-5 minutes I remove the tea bag, toss it and add the milk. That way I haven't just tossed out a milk-covered tea bag, since sometimes I do that at my desk at work and would prefer not to have a smelly trash bin.

As for the type of milk, the UK is on a different type of milkfat content as us, so we don't use the same terms. [This] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_content_of_milk#Terms_for_fat_content_by_country) goes into it a good bit, so it's all really your preference. I'm on a high fat low carb diet so I enjoy heavy cream in mine and it's orgasmic (though it creeps my fiance out).

Some people add sugar, but no one I've met does.

Enjoy your cuppa. Get some digestives on Amazon and/or Cost Plus and enjoy. Hope this helps!

&gt; Tim, you've been a loyal servant to the club and we are happy with your work so far. We would like to give you the opportunity to manage the first team on an interim basis. If you have aspirations of managing in the Premiership long-term, this is a tremendous chance for you to learn something and gain some experience. 

&gt;You must understand that we, as a club with high aspirations, will be looking to replace AVB with the most qualified person we can, and this means that after the World Cup, we will most likely hire someone with a considerably longer c.v. than you. 

&gt; In the meantime, we'd like you to hold down the fort for the next six months. You know our organization and our players, and you'll help maintain some stability and continuity during this period of transition. We'll even make it an 18 month contract, and pay you an extra year's worth of wages to make it worth your while. When next summer comes, you'll still have a spot in our organization if you want it, or you can move forward with your career with a new and valuable experience under your belt.

And that's it. People are acting like Sherwood is in a tough spot here, but he's not at all. He's an inexperienced but aspiring manager, and he's been given a great if temporary opportunity to learn. From that perspective, it's a win-win situation for him no matter how it turns out, because it's a stepping stone in his career. By simply *planning* on it being a temporary position, it's a winning situation for everyone. 

If Sherwood pulls some miracle and gets us into the top four, and really seems to be the real deal, then keep him. Even that result, however, might not make his resume or prospects as our manager better than the people who might replace him. Levy would have been foolish to promise Sherwood the position based on an outcome like that, and frankly, I think Levy is too cagey to allow himself to get boxed in like that.

Drop Mousa deeper, and push the wingers up a bit.  Give the fullbacks license to get forward *but be responsible in doing so*.  We need some balance going forward.

true,Andures,null,null,"Some macro points: 

1. Know your audience. Who are you writing for? A Liverpool fan, or someone familiar with the Premier League, wouldn't need you to tell them who Lucas Leiva or Simon Mignolet is. Someone who doesn't know football would have no idea at all what you're saying. What you wrote seems to be for someone who knows football terms, but have no idea how it works to the extent that injuries causing inconsistent performance is a revelation. 

2. Keep to what you know. You're not a professional, so don't pretend to be one. Explaining inconsistency? Seriously? What's next, a formula for success? Write about things that you can be qualified for, like your feelings about a particular player. 

3. Use resources. Whoscored and Transfermarkt are free websites. There are many others that provide details such as line-ups as far back as 10 years ago. Opta may require subscription, but the OptaJoe twitter account provides lots of useful snippets. If you really want to say something, use facts to back yourself up. 

4. Create value. Your opinion may be important to you, but not everyone else. Before you think about sharing your opinion, especially on the internet with other Liverpool fans who may be much more knowledgeable than you and have better resources than you, think about whether what you're saying is actually valuable. You took almost 700 words to say that injuries contribute to inconsistent performance, which is a total waste of time. ""Guise, if some people in a group get injured, then the group tends to perform poorly and erratically, guise. Eureka!"" is literally what your whole post is. 

5. Find niche topics. Now after disregarding your personal opinion, having various research resources at your fingertips, and deciding that you want to write for the people on reddit, you need to find a topic. Look for something niche that isn't regularly discussed, like the performance of replacements during injury, and the dillema when a first team player returns from a layoff. The development of a youth player who has broken into the senior team. Things that actually require insight. 

6. Use proper channels. If you find yourself unable to do any of the things above, it doesn't mean that you should keep silent forever. Commenting in a discussion post can allow you to voice your opinions, and also for you to gauge the response. Just because you have an opinion doesn't mean you have to blog it, or try to promote it on Reddit.

&gt;I think part of it might be that hero printing costs more so it's seen as bourgeois and looked down upon by the ""working class"" football fan.

Wait, what? 15 quids extra for some print is hardly ""bourgeois"" material if you already got the 50 to spend on the shirt. It's like buying an extra cheeseburger at McDonald's if you've already ordered a meal, you don't notice that much of a difference cost-wise.

If it's looked down upon to have a player on your shirt (all three of mine have names on the back) I would assume it's because of the ""club over player""-mentality. Just think of all the ~~Spurs~~ Bale fans that got Madrid shirts after he left, that is probably the issue.

true,kvural,tardis,TARDIS,"It's all a bit muddled, but as best as I can tell, from the Time Lord perspective *The End of Time* and *The Day of the Doctor* actually happen near-simultaneously.

Let's look at what we could reasonably conclude about the last days of the Time War:

The time lock is put in place before the Time War actually ends, or so it seems to me (otherwise Rassilon would just be able to send anything through the time lock rather than having to think of ways to sidestep it). Rassilon is aware that the Doctor is about to, or intending to, do something that will destroy Daleks and Time Lords alike.

We know of course that this was the Doctor's original plan, but that at the last moment this was replaced with a plan to hide it or transport it to another dimension. So Rassilon's knowledge is incomplete.

My explanation:

Rassilon and the Gallifreyan High Command from the second special are not the exact same faction, or at least they're on different levels of the food chain. Possibly Rassilon is with the military leadership while Bald Guy from *Day of the Doctor* is civilian leadership.

Rassilon, knowing the War Doctor is going to destroy them all, secretly concocts a plan to have the Time Lords ""transcend"" reality. The civilian leadership are not notified of this on the reasonable basis that Rassilon is bollocks-out crazy.

Gallifrey begins to materialize around Earth, but it's also in the middle of the mass insanity of a Dalek siege. In the space of five or ten minutes Rassilon is destroyed and the time lock reinstated anyway, returning everything to its original position. In the general scrum of apocalyptic war, almost no one one the street has much reason to believe they've briefly jumped light-years across space.

The civilian high command may notice this or they may not, depending on what data their instruments register or are focused on registering. In any case, since it's a transient effect, and since they've just been notified that Rassilon died of Skeletor-lightning-related causes, and since they're literally on the edge of extinction anyway, they don't have a whole lot of time to dwell on these things.

Shortly afterwards, in any case - maybe even in the next few minutes - the thirteen Doctors contact Gallifrey to inform the high command of their plan. The civilian command, if it has noticed the small detail that they jumped eye-watering distances across spacetime and back in the space of a short coffee break, assumes this is some side effect relating to the Doctor's timeline-bending actions. They don't have much time to think about it, anyway, since they're going to be zapped into Dimension X in the space of twenty seconds.

Large ceramic mug. Tea bag in. Boiling water to about 3/4 volume. Stir couple of times partially crushing bag. Watch dark goodness emerge. 60 seconds is all that is needed for UK tea bags as they are specially made for a quick brew. Lift bag out with tea spoon crushing it against side of mug. Eject into receptacle to allow cooling prior to manual crushing to expel maximum water before municipal composting.

Add semi-skimmed milk. The amount of milk massively effects the resulting drink and there is a sweet spot where the tannins are sufficiently suppressed but the tea flavour is not overwhelmed. You need to work this out for yourself by colour.

Add one teaspoon white sugar.

Enjoy.

true,WilliamtheV,mcgannnew,new McGann,"I've kind of had a rough draft around for a while. Shame the BBC doesn't take submissions for guest writers.

Instead of the whole ""town of Christmas"" thing, I was banking on Omega trying to steal the Doctor's body again after managing to manifest (mentally) in this universe. He would remotely hijack the TARDIS as he had done before, to trap the doctor and finish off his grand plan.

He would kill the Doctor and steal his body. After being forced to realize that he was nothing more than a mind, he used his total control over the anti-matter universe to craft himself something more physical. However, he could not take this new Timelord body into the normal universe without annihilating himself. 

The transfer process would be quite traumatic, so much so that it would trigger a regeneration. Upon discovering that the Doctor was out of them, Omega would ""gift"" his new body's regenerations (all 12 of them) to the Doctor, with the intent of making the body safe to inhabit. Once the regeneration energy is siphoned off to the Doctor, the Doctor defeats Omega, and runs off with the new regeneration cycle.

I like the idea of using a regeneration offensively, if not as grandiosely as 11 did when he destroyed the Dalek ship over Christmas.

Perhaps he would trigger a regeneration the way Romana did, and (in a way similar in intensity as when 10 regenerated) use that to break out of his restraints, destroy Omega's machinery/cause the Tardis to spark up, and begin running. The Doctor, sprinting away from a doomed Omega, would regenerate mid-stride.

Thus the new Doctor would start his life, quite literally, on the run.

And of course, all throughout, the Doctor would give hints of his existence as the Other (as 7 did when referring to the Hand of Omega), and Omega would slowly realize that the Doctor was not just a renegade timelord. He was something else, intrinsic to the universe, woven into the very fabric of reality. The Doctor is a Fact, and his name, his true name no longer exists.

The problem, imo, is that the Yes campaign seem to be trying to make out that Independence has no risks and they'll keep parts of the Union they like whilst improving the rest irrespective of what those who will remain in the UK think. They're asking Scotland to vote to leave the Union and then want to set up another one. However leaving the United Kingdom means just that. The vote in September is to leave the UK and that includes all the institutions, structures, people and services that come with it. They'll need to set up their own.

The question was : are you , when faced with the genuine love and humanity of another person, going to turn around and lecture them for believing in God or are you just going to let it slide ie. If a litte old woman goes ""God Bless You"" - is your response a lecture inspired by reading out the quotes from /r/atheism ?

Secondly, there's no evidence the guy didn't acknowledge that his doctors, hospital or the donor were the reason that he's alive. All he did was tack on that phrase - which YOU have no understanding of because YOU weren't there, and you're reading through the filter of the article. 

So what you've basically done is taken the one sentence, hung on it all your conceptions of what Christianity is, what theism is and then decided to have a go at the guy.  

That's two things - a) you're being a dick  and b) you've failed your own test for evidence because you've loaded your entire worldview on the utterance of one word without any supporting evidence whatsoever.

There's a reason logical positivism falls apart around 1970 when it comes to understanding the human condition.

If he were to get sacked from the club or not agree to coach under LvG in a way i would understand it. Wants to make his own mark as a manager thinks he can guide a team full time. Totally understandable for a manager to have ambition (note this is more or less what De Boer has indicated, that in the future he would want to coach somewhere else than Ajax), its a good thing for a manager to be ambitious. 

But i would wonder if TS would get caught in an odd slot, has managed a top half squad for his first posting. Presumably he would want to continue with PL team, but at the same time he may not have done quite enough to land a PL posting.  Its the type of situation where he could end up taking a post in the PL that would actually be a bad fit and put him in a bad situation.

I think the main difference is that under Rafa we were more consistent, but then I also think that team had more experience, and more players in their prime years (Carra, Alonso, Mascherano, Gerrard, Torres, Kuyt). At the moment with Sturridge, Allen, Henderson, Sterling, Sakho, Flannagan, Coutinho, Mignolet... we have a lot of players in our starting XI who are currently still on the young side by Premier League standards. 

I would say the 08/09 team was better than our current team right now, but I'd be amazed if the average age wasn't a couple of years older, and I think given a few years to mature our current first XI will develop into a stronger side.

Why did they think the UK government would agree to such a deal? Because Scotland as a positive balance of trade with the rest of the world, i.e. sells more stuff than it buys back, and to lose these exports will reduce the UK balance of trade. It is also because of the significant intra-UK trade, which would negatively effect rUK as well as Scotland if there are currency fee's involved.


Now I am a yes supporter, but I don't really think the currency union was ever really a good idea, if you are going to have a currency union it would be easier to just have a federal scotland (devo-max) with all tax + spend powers than be independent within a currency union.

Inland in the drier and flatter parts however, it's completely different. Many watercourses don't even have a single well-defined channel.

This was at a poorly performing comprehensive as well. But the teachers were still very good (fortunately).

That said you do get some awful ones who are just dead wood. But generally the staff know who they are. Teachers aren't blind automatons that need to be hand-held and spoon-fed by politicians they are experienced and well-qualified professionals and to be honest I think an awful lot of good would be done just by attracting decent people to the profession (not allowing it to fall to the awful standards pre-Blair (I hate that man but he did help education somewhat)) and letting them get on with their jobs.

The thing is the teachers should teach the difficult topics and offer help but far more importantly they should inspire the desire to learn more - as you typically only get a few hours a week on each subject so getting the students to appreciate why they should learn more will be far more effective (and useful) than merely trying to handhold them through exams.

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"&gt; If it helps, empathy is not something that requires the physical state of crying.

&gt; Empathy is an action and a practice that requires you to consider another persons values, ideas, opinions, beliefs, experiences, thoughts, fears, morals, memories, feelings, perspectives, goals, wants, needs.

&gt; And if you don't know about these for the person you can ask.

&gt; It is the act of considering the other person in your consciousness and actions as much as you can. You can do it whether you feel the same way as the person or not, whether you agree or not, whether you like the person or not.

&gt; It's not cut off from anyone, no matter what emotional state they are in. Which is why it's never an excuse for an abusive person to say, ""sorry I was just angry.""

&gt; All someone has to do is do it. Unless there is something that is more preferable to them (like believing they have to keep only their consciousness in the forefront at the expense of everyone else or they will no longer exist, i.e. narcissism/certain mental illnesses/eta: developmental or atypical brain processes/ptsd or someone in extreme crisis)

&gt; It takes practice, and for everyone there is always a way to be better at it, but empathy is an equal opportunity access to all humans. There are times when the reason you can't is because it's protective, and times when it's maladaptive.

&gt; It's one of the most powerful tools for health, its like a beacon. You always have it even if it may be difficult to use. But even recognizing that you can't practice enough empathy, and having that inform your actions, is in itself empathy, and it's more than enough.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I'm tired of people that can't admit that there are lots of different dogs and some are more dangerous than others. Be it for temperament or physical characteristics they are - pit bulls exist in the perfect storm of being both physically dangerous and of bad temperament - and sadly also as a status symbol for fuckwits. About 40% of all fatal attacks in the US are pit bulls - so yes you can make value based judgements on which dogs are dangerous. At no point has anyone suggested that we should ban dogs on the basis the one kills a child once. 

1. Given there are plenty of much less dangerous dogs a reasonable compromise is to allow them and ban just the most dangerous - and guess what - that's exactly how society has chosen to deal with the problem.

2. Stop turning this into an argument about banning everything that can cause fatalities. It's a dumb argument. Swimming pools - for example - serve an extremely worthwhile purpose - as do cars, medicines, etc etc. *Crucially* pools are also (almost exclusively) a danger only to those that consent to using them - as apposed to violent dogs which are a danger to everyone they come in contact with. Is it getting tiresome listening to and ignoring the same points over &amp; over again just to fire back with something dumb ('lets ban ovens since people commit suicide in them?'). 

3. The fact that you can use a handgun in the Olympics is trivial - which is why not many people care that they are banned to serve a greater purpose - remove as many from society as possible. 

4. The gun culture argument is much bigger than this - its about removing them from civilian use in as many cases as possible - because the opposite side of that coin is the US where the level of murders is far higher specifically because they have a lot of guns. The level of crime is similar in the UK to the US, but the level of murders is a fraction because of the lack of firearms. The reduction of firearms in society is a generation long strategy that will not pay dividends for many years. But everyone knows that the closer we are to zero guns the easier it is to have zero firearms related murders. 

&gt; Do you think that we should never reassess a policy when the evidence says it doesn't work? 

You're like the typical teenage redditor bringing up all these 'straw mans' and 'false dilemas' in order to argue a point (that has been argued in society at large already and lost).

Of course you should re-assess policies regularly. But until someone can think of a reason why a pitbull is necessary and it's purpose cannot be easily served by another safer breed they are not going to suddenly decide that its a good idea to have them back. And until someone can think of a reason why civilians need handguns (beyond 'I want to shoot targets for fun') they are unlikely to feel the need to re-introduce them. 

tl;dr please *please* stop with the idiotic argument that banning a dangerous dog breed is equivalent to banning anything that has caused fatalities.

2. It's a reasonably analogy. Back to re bathtub analogy at the end of your statement you state that if another dog can do the job of a ""dangerous"" dog then we should ban that breed, by using that argument there is absolutely no need for bathtubs when showers will suffice, and such a ban would save more children than a damn dog ban. 

3. The reason they were removed was due to the belief that it would reduce gun violence. This belief is completely false and lacking in evidence. What is your opinion of the Channel Islands and New Zealand allowing private ownership if handguns and having lower incidence of gun violence than us? Might you have to accept that there is no correlation at all?

4. Complete nonsense. Again there is no correlation between gun rights or gun ownership either within the US or on an international level (EU or OECD) to gun violence. Your position has absolutely no evidence behind it. If your theory was true we would see the states/nations with harsh controls having the lowest incidences of gun violence, we don't. Repeat after me: ""The gun control theory has no evidence behind it"". Seriously your dogmatic dedication to the baseless gun control theory makes you sound like a young earth creationist.

Fundamentally when the government wishes to stop me from doing something, owning something, or going somewhere, etc... Then the government needs to provide good reason why I shouldn't be able to do/own/go to that thing. The onus shouldn't be on me.

When gun control has no evidence that it works and when dog banning is based upon freak occurrences I'm going to need to see some better reasons actually based on evidence that exists.

It's more complicated.

The Day of the Doctor hasn't begun here yet, but the End of Time has. The Doctor has already acquired the Moment at this point. (the war council only realizes this a little while later, AFTER the high council)

The entirety of End of Time occurs. (which really is NOT a long time from the Timelord's perspective, like 5 minutes tops)

Day of the Doctor occurs (End of Time is referenced: ""The High Council's plans have already failed""), War Council is NOW being informed of the Moment being stolen.

&gt;Anecdotal evidence suggest that top QCs can be handsomely rewarded, while those who have just entered the profession can find themselves in dire straits financially.
Nigel Lithman QC says he has been in contact with a barrister in her second year of practice whose taxable income was just under £14,000.
The anonymous Lincoln’s Inn barrister who writes this blog says she took home about £10,000 last year, bitterly concluding: “I would quite literally have been better off on benefits.”

Absolutely not because the USA is too far gone - gun control in America is 100 times harder because there are already far too many guns in circulation and specifically illegal ones. That is not the case for the UK where it is manageable.

Gun control evidence = comparison with US crime as guns increased, as well as long term goal not short term objectives. Dog banning isn't done on freak occurrences - saying that doesn't make it true. You can argue that point when a Labrador gets banned.

Prison payphones are ruinously expensive to use, and also not at all private, so faced with being able to afford maybe a couple of minutes a week of chat in a public area vs an hour or two in private, it is not overly surprising that many prisoners turn to smuggled mobiles.

What should happen is that the payphone system is fixed so that prisoners can make calls via a private phone in their cells to a preset limit of approved phone numbers at a minimal fee.

Encouraging stronger family ties being one of the best ways of reducing repeat offending.

At the moment, the system penalises those who want to keep a link to family and lumps them into the same category as those trying to commit crimes.

Jamming phones is in itself not a bad thing, but it needs to be done in tandem with improving landline services.

While you might think its a non issue - there is little doubt cyclists get a bum deal when dealing with the law. Cyclists can do everything right and still a driver will be excused.

Who?

if around 60-75% of car/cycle collisions are the faults of the driver (based on government stats) and cyclists are responsible for 0-2 deaths a year do you really regard cyclists as a danger compared to cars (between 1000-1800 deaths a year)?


&gt;I still say ALL road users should have to pass similar driving and theory tests, even if you don't have an engine. 

85-90% of cyclists already own a car or have a full driving license. They have passed a test.  But its irrelevant. All road users are expected to have a working knowledge of the HC (inc pedestrians btw). Cars are heavy machinery and should be treated as such.


Can I suggest that your attitude is the exact reason why cyclists get the crappy deal they do.

As far as the balance of payments is concerned, and the cost of doing business, the previous poster has already shown that there is no value for the rUK on this front since any currency union will only be as long as it suits the Scots anyway (and rightly so; why would any nation act against their own interests?).

Then combine it with entitlement issues (I pay tax cyclists don't) or an  incorrect understanding of the highway code (how dare that cyclist cycle in the middle of the lane), or better yet sweeping generalization (I saw a cyclist jump a red light so therefor they all do)  then unfortunately cyclists end up with the shitty end of the stick.

That's why Cameron made the 'money no issue' statement, because Farrage lied about it and the situation needed to be clarified. 

Do you really think your snide comments are an effective way to protest government policies? To declare that it doesn't matter if ordinary people, and no, not everyone affected is a Tory voting Zillionaire as much as you'd like that to be true, have lost their homes and businesses because ..somehow having a government you don't like absolves you of the responsibility to exercise basic human decency and empathy?

London and the South East are very densely populated so they get priority because there's more lives at risk there, I don't for the life of me get why this is an issue, if we were running flood emergency response and recovery in a foreign country we would also prioritise the most populated areas. 

I can't stand the way certain people from certain areas talk about London in such a resentful, jealous way, it's the most populous city in the UK and it's our our financial, political and cultural Capital. It's more important than other cities in the country.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; If Scotland spent beyond its means, the UK would be forced to bail them out to avoid massive economic problems. If the UK got into similar problems, Scotland wouldn't possibly be able to provide any help because the differences in the size of economy would be too massive.

This is effectively true of the Eurozone anyway - the UK has had to provide funding to central European banks aimed at providing liquidity to PIIGS banks because they bet on bad deals.  We did that because it was in our national interests to do it and I'm sure if Scotland adopted the Euro and spent beyond their means then we'd do the same for them.  If that is the case then it doesn't matter what currency they are using. 

The main complaint seems to be 'spending beyond their means' or acting as a tax haven, but that would be entirely dependent on what a new government wanted to do.  Sure it is the SNP at the moment, but if Scotland wanted to, they could vote in the Tories and peg back their government spending to do what they want.  Given that corporation tax is such a minor part of the income of a country (Corporation tax was £44bn for the whole of the UK in 2011/12), this seems like a poor argument.  Companies who want to use tax havens will already be using them, not waiting for Scotland to arrive and compete with Ireland for low tax rates.

The argument against Scotland being independent again seems to fall as an argument against the SNP and their policies.  Whilst that might be the view from England, as an Englishman of Scottish heritage, I'm not sure it is the argument from Scotland: They're far more interested in self-determinism than what the SNP say they should be doing.

Truth be told, over the 90 minutes you had two great chances (one-on-ones) but your players seemed to prefer to burst the net than a simple finish past our keeper.

Second half was 90% us. We weathered your 10 minute storm straight from KO, and then it was constant pressure in your half.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Scotland has already said it is more than willing to take on it's share of the national debt. Every statement by the Yes campaign agrees with this but there is plenty of legal opinion that asserts there is no legal obligation for it to do so. Any suggestion that the SNP have officially stated it wouldn't honour a share of debt exists only in your own imagination. 

I'm pretty sure it was you who asked why an independent Scotland should honour the debt if it didn't get its way on currency union.  In any case, the position I ascribed to the SNP is pretty obviously stated by a senior member of the SNP in the article above:

&gt;""It would cost their own businesses hundreds of millions of pounds, it would blow a massive hole in their balance of payments and it would leave them having to pick up the entirety of UK debt.""

Whether or not the option to fail to honour the debt is official SNP policy, it is clearly being bandied about as a threat by senior SNP figures so it equally clearly doesn't exist only in my imagination.


&gt;Amazing this presumption though that assets like the pound are UK only but debts are shared.

The pound is not the kind of asset that can simply be divided because it is an intellectual asset, a notion, rather than a thing.  What the SNP means when they say it should be divided as an asset is that the rUK is obliged, somehow, to give up its sovereignty to a currency union without the members of the rUK having any say in the matter.  To the extent that the pound is a concrete asset, fine, it can be divided - Scotland can take their share of the intellectual and historical baggage that constitute the pound and issue their own pounds while rUK can do the same.  You will see that this means two currencies, though.  Hell, take the pound as a whole and the rUK can call their own currency something different.  It won't make any difference because what is really at issue is that Scotland wants the support of the rest of the UK that is implicit in a currency union but wants to deny them the right to make the choice about whether to be involved for themselves.  

tl;dr The pound is only metaphorically an asset that can be divided.  It is not a tangible asset and it is a mistake to take the metaphor for reality, as you are doing. ",0,1392212199,null,0,1392214974,0,cfdejzw,t3_1xp1wp,t1_cfdejzw,t1_cfdeag2,null,1432363966,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The point is to weigh up the relative harm to the individual and to make a decision based on the scientific data that we have rather than the brain dead politically motivated system of prohibition which we have now.

The thing about 'legal' highs is that the governments stance on drugs is directly to blame because by cracking down on illegal drugs they have forced undesirables to come up with innovative ways to get around the law.

These legal highs are brand new chemicals being developed by labs in China which are sold in corner-shops to anyone. There are reports of kids as young as 12 getting access to them. In comparison, MDMA(ecstasy) has over 30 years of scientific research behind it.

We lack education, planning, and real science when it come to drug policy in the UK and as such the situation is that it's easier to get dangerous legal highs than ever before. This is a direct result of prohibition in the UK.

""I wouldn't say I'm throwing him under the bus.  I actually love Lucas.  The reality is though that Gerrard is going to play almost every game (barring injury/fitness) and Lucas and Gerrard simply shouldn't be playing at the same time as we are far better with only one of them in our midfield.  Gerrard simply runs out of gas trying to do too much work and Lucas doesn't have the stamina he used to pre-ACL injury.

The fact is though that Lucas is anywhere near as confident with his passing as Gerrard is though, you just don't see anything but fairly run of the mill passes from him.  Certainly none of the wonder-passes Gerrard and Coutinho often make.  While Gerrard isn't as good at tackling (although he is still very good), he offers a lot more creative flow from the back and with fitter midfielders effectively covering some ground for him we are able to really put on a lot of pressure.

[This article](http://anfieldindex.com/6556/defensive-midfielder-potential-targets-comparison-to-liverpool-lucas-leiva.html) offers much better analysis on his offensive play.""

The recent interest in this kind of policy has been shown by a new head teacher at a local school. I know particularly one art teacher who now is forced to cover teaching textiles after one teacher being sacked. The new textiles teacher is unqualified by her own admission to teach the subject. She would be the only teacher in this field. According to her there's a pressure to remove old staff purely based on the benefits they'd be receiving at that level of age and experience (10+ years in the job).

This is hearsay, so take what you want. But I know some teachers are likely to blame difficult classes rambunctious students for poor results.

I highly doubt that Jose doesn't believe we are the best team the England. He just recognizes that we are young and will likely slip up against lesser competition because we are overconfident. I think he is 100% correct. I still think we win the league, but we need to maintain focus. There is no excuse to go into Man City's house and slap them around, only to follow up 8 days later with a lazy performance against WBA. 

But....if we are able to be at the TOZL with a young, immature roster, imagine how good we will be next year with more experience.

bigotry/generalizations/hatred based upon nothing more than a mode of transport. Of course its not the same but the attitude behind it is - and it exists unfortunately.

I have no interest in being the underdog - I simply want to get from A-B safely with a degree of respect knowing that if a car hits me/or a pedestrian (though no fault of my own) the legal system will act appropriately.

Here's a recent one
http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/yoursay/letters/10996773.Cyclist_s_death__was_the_fault_of_all_cyclists_/?action=success

&gt;People know that cyclists are allowed to do it, they just don't think it is done at sensible times.

And there's the problem...""they just don't think"", or they don't know, or they don't care. All ends badly for cyclists who might have genuine reasons for acting the way they do.

&gt;Yet I would say it is a sweeping generalisation to say that all motorists hate cyclists, is it not?

I never said all - most have very little issue with cyclists, and most drivers are totally brilliant on the roads. The issue though is the perception of cyclists vrs that of drivers.

Yesterday Bitcoin crashed from $750 per coin to $100 per coin because ONE PERSON noticed and pointed out a technical flaw in the payment system.. 

If you want to exchange your pound sterlings secured on an economy with a stable 1-3% annual inflation rate for a currency that can lose 6/7ths of it's value in one day go ahead but please, don't go offering financial advise to anyone. 

Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme, that's all it is, the people who got in first might make some money from it but everyone else is a mark. It's never going to be a competitive currency because people aren't using it for that, people are hoarding and trying to buy low and sell high.. everyone is trying to get rid of their ~~Tulips~~ bitcoins before the bubble bursts, it's being treated as a dodgy commodity, not as a currency.   The only people using it as a currency, outside of uses where virtual currency is just convenient, such as in WoW, are the very gullible and those who don't want their purchases tracked because, like Silk Road, it's being used to trade drugs and guns and child porn and like Silk Road it'll eventually get shut down.

(Comparison for my American friends): This reminds me of when people were attacking the LA Lakers for not trading Andrew Bynum to get Jason Kidd. Kidd was clearly the better player at the time and one of the all-time greats. However, Bynum was a much younger player with incredibly potential. After a few years of development, Bynum was a huge part of the Lakers success and helped them win two NBA titles. Yes, Kidd was the better player at the time and the better player overall, but sometimes you have to factor in future potential and fit into the equation.

&gt;

&gt;The **Premier Reserve League** (officially known as The [Barclays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays) Premier Reserve League for [sponsorship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_sponsorship) reasons) was the [reserve team](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_team) league for the top [English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) [football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_(soccer\)) teams in the [Premier League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League). The league was split into a northern and a southern division.

&gt;The league started out in 1999, replacing [The Central League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Central_League) in the north and [The Football Combination](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Combination) in the south as the top level of reserve-team football, although those competitions continued for lower-level teams.

&gt;From the [2006–07 edition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006%E2%80%9307_FA_Premier_Reserve_League) until its disbandment, the league was only open to sides whose senior teams were one of the 20 members of the [Premier League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League). As a result, a senior team's relegation from the Premier League would mean relegation for the reserve team from the Premier Reserve League and replacement by the reserve team of the promoted team from the [Championship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_Championship).

Sherwood does have his UEFA badges by the way; he just doesn't yet have the highest level. And my point about managers is that almost every single one of these formation posts is poorly thought out.

Let me make one clear distinction; I don't mind the lineup posts; it's one thing to discuss our players and where they play best, and what combinations of players we use. That's an interesting and fruitful discussion. But these formation posts? I have yet to see a single one that's contributed anything of note to r/COYS. Because they're either like this one, utterly lacking in actual tactical use, or they're simply someone saying ""we should play 4-3-3 with these players!"" which is more of a lineup post anyways.

What else should we talk about? I'll make a quick list for you; Lineups, players we want, why a player isn't in form, how sexy our players are, what are chances are in the league, who we want in the next round of the cup, who we want to manage us, what we think of last game's tactics, what we think our next opponent's tactics will be, who we should sell, who's going to be fit, who we should loan out... Should I continue? My point is, there a plenty of things to talk about on r/COYS without having these type of posts about garbage fantasy formations that we will never play, because they're almost always complete shit.

I know that's really unhelpful, but people have such widely differing tastes that it's impossible to know.  If she's particularly traditional in jewellery, I would expect her to be after a 'standard' diamond solitaire, and black diamonds would probably disqualify you from that.  If you're after an alternative to diamond then [moissanite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moissanite) is becoming hugely popular.  It's almost as hard as diamond (9.5 on the Mohs scale vs 10), actually sparklier (double refraction index, produces rainbows) and generally cheaper as it can be lab grown relatively easily.  Otherwise, white sapphire is a fairly popular choice (9 Mohs hardness), and is also cheaper.

Personally, I'm a fan of coloured stones.  Black diamond looks awesome and appears to be synthetic only, so you don't have to worry about any of the ethical issues.  A quick google shows you can find some beautiful rings with black diamond; if you think she'd like that then absolutely go for it.  My ideal engagement ring is sapphire for colour and moissanite for sparkles, so I'm inclined not to care about tradition or fashion.

&gt;**Moissanite** /ˈmɔɪsənaɪt/ originally referred to a rare mineral discovered by [Henri Moissan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Moissan) having a chemical formula SiC and various crystalline [polymorphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(materials_science\)). Earlier, this material had been synthesized in the laboratory and named [silicon carbide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_carbide) (SiC).

Moreover, they have a far greater and more recent fractious history than England and Scotland.

I can't see how the rUK could deny Scotland using the pound as currency beyond simply being thoroughly uncooperative. If Scotland as an independent nation wishes to accept British Pound Sterling as legal tender, all the rUK could really do is introduce some sort of border controls and engage petulantly in trade negotiations and diplomacy. However, this would simply be cutting off the nose to spite the face. All George Osborne is doing is posturing to guide people to the No camp without a firm political or legal basis.

Btw, I feel an independent Scotland would be better off taking on its own currency and I think the only reason the SNP are saying otherwise to draw those more resistant to change into the Yes camp.

Barcelona were far from their best in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semifinals against Real Sociedad. They still managed to score a 2-0 victory, however, courtesy of Sergio Busquets and an own goal from Zubikarai to carry a clear edge into the second leg.
The Blaugrana are coming off a convincing 4-1 triumph over Sevilla. Lionel Messi emerged from his open-play slump with two goals to lead the charge. It was exactly the type of performance Barca needed after a brief drop in overall form.
Things haven't been going as well for Sociedad. They haven't scored a single goal over their past three matches, losing two and drawing one by a combined score of 6-0. The Erreala will need a drastic increase in their level of play in the second leg.
Let's check out all of the important viewing information for the crucial clash. That's followed by a breakdown of the top storyline and a match prediction.

op Storyline: Can Sociedad Mount a Semifinal Comeback in the Second Leg?
Sociedad enter the second match with a glimmer of hope. They were competitive with Barcelona for a vast majority of the first leg and are only down by two because of a freak own goal. Barca's lackluster play was a contributing factor, but the Erreala also deserve some credit for keeping it close.
Barcelona understand that, as well. After the match, The Guardian passed along comments from star midfielder Xavi. He talked about the team's failed efforts to add a couple more goals to put the semifinal completely out of reach:
We wanted to score more goals given that we had an extra man and we could have scored more but it's a very favourable result. We haven't conceded a goal at home and that's also a point very much in our favour.
Since Barca couldn't add more to their edge, Sociedad return home with a chance. Heading into the first leg, they couldn't have asked for more than that. So the Blaugrana have to approach the match with caution, especially early on, to prevent a serious comeback bid.
The effort starts with stability in the midfield. Cesc Fabregas was key in the first match. He played really well in the middle of the pitch to make sure Barcelona maintained control even though they weren't at their best in the final third. It earned him WhoScored's Man of the Match honors:
Barcelona will need more of the same from Fabregas and his midfield mates to survive that initial surge from Sociedad. If they can do that, the Erreala will have no choice but to start playing a more aggressive line, which will open up chances for Messi and Co.
Ultimately, it's a match that should play right into Barca's hands thanks to their ability to control pace and possession. But if they make even one mistake in the early going and let Sociedad back into the semifinal, tense moments will await.
Barcelona are in the middle of a very busy stretch. In turn, they will probably employ a conservative strategy in this match in order to advance without overextending themselves. There's no reason to use energy pushing for extra goals once a spot in the final is secure.
Knowing that, it probably won't be the most thrilling match of the tournament. Instead, expect a very workmanlike performance from Barca in order to eliminate any Sociedad comeback hopes. They should advance with a narrow win in the second leg.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I provided a poll to counter your anecdote. You may question it's validity but seriously if you think its worse than your anecdotal evidence then there's not any more to be said.

A meaningless poll that asks a massaged question is useless.  It doesn't become of some use just because it is a poll.  A useless poll is a useless poll and does not provide something better than anecdotal evidence.

Now, I'm perfectly aware of the fallibility of anecdotal evidence, which is precisely why I flagged it up as the basis for my view.  However, when I consider my anecdotal evidence rationally, what I see are my largely left-leaning friends and acquaintances in a notoriously anti-nationalistic sector of the employment market, the majority of whom are in favour of closer integration with the EU and are broadly admirers of the European project (although with a slight majority opposing Euro membership), i.e. probably the sector of rUK society most likely to be sympathetic towards a currency union with Scotland, are broadly opposed.

To this I add the more rabid blatherings of the people I know to the right of my friends and colleagues.  On top of this, I survey the papers and see the relative unanimity amongst populist politicians who are unlikely to have suddenly developed a conscience and started doing what they feel is right even if it is against what their electoral base wants.  Putting all this anecdotal evidence together I see no strong rUK voice in support of a currency union with Scotland and a powerful voice against it.  I do not believe myself to be so out of touch with British society to have misread it that badly.  If the population of the rUK want a currency union, where are the voices supporting it?  Why are the politicians en-masse taking a position opposed by their voters? 

So, I'm fairly comfortable with my anecdotal assessment because it is rationally based and grounded in a relatively broad-based analysis of a range of data.  Of course, if a reasonable poll came along demonstrating views to the contrary I would be perplexed but would have to revise my opinion.  But that the poll you cited is not reliable or reasonable - in fact, I would have been quite likely to answer yes to the vague question there when my actual view is no to a currency union.

Yes, and Bitcoin is decentralised, overbought, highly speculated upon and for these reasons extremely sensitive to news. What I am describing is more akin to central banking that bitcoin, apart from the underlying technical protocol which would use the successful elements of bitcoin, i.e. a public blockchain. 

&gt;don't go offering financial advise to anyone.

Where exactly was I offering financial **advice**? I am talking about a potential protocol for a national currency, nothing else.

Most of your post is railing against bitcoin and has no relevance to what I'm saying. Bitcoin isn't a pyramid scheme, it's a protocol. Can people use it as such? Yes, of course, but it is a tool in itself and nothing more. 

&gt;like Silk Road it'll eventually get shut down.

I'd be interested to hear how you think it will be shut down. Silk Road was an organisation, with leaders, servers, assets. Bitcoin, as I said, is a protocol. There is nothing to shut down.

true,stilldontknow2,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; I'm pretty sure it was you who asked why an independent Scotland should honour the debt if it didn't get its way on currency union.  In any case, the position I ascribed to the SNP is pretty obviously stated by a senior member of the SNP in the article above:,

When I become an official campaign rep for the SNP you might validly use my statements as representative of the Yes campaign. As it was I asked a question of why Scotland has a responsibility for UK debts if it becomes a successor state? Now I personally believe we have a moral obligation to shoulder a proportionate share of the debt and in any post referendum negotiation the exact amount would be up for discussion. We also have a practical obligation as it demonstrates to financial markets a responsible approach and provides an immediate reassurance that Scotland pays back debts. To me these trump any lack of legal obligation and set the tone for positive atmosphere for negotiation going forward.

The SNP does not say rUK has no say on whether or not Scotland can be part of a currency union, it says all the evidence points to be the mutual benefit of the two parties and the mechanics of how it works are again matters for discussion. It, again, has already conceded that doing so cedes some sovereignty, in exactly the same way Belgium or Ireland cede sovereignty as part of the Euro zone. You're argument is full assumptions about SNP positions that they don't actually hold. 

To be frank I think it's a mistake for Salmond not to spell out his plan B or C should currency union not be an option but he's assuming a degree of good will and recognition of mutual benefit and in continually spelling out the positives it plays well for the Yes campaign. If all the obstacles to successful relations between successor states are thrown up by those who say the want to keep the union it only boost the idea that Scots may not want to be part of a union that would damage their own interests rather than see a well managed split.  In exactly the same way the unionist politicians will attempt to make the prospects of independence as pitfall bound as possible.

I've been witness to some really poor overtaking (resulting in no gain) that probably wouldn't have happened if the motorists knew how harrowing it can be to be passed closely. If only they waited until a more appropriate location to pass, they'd have only added a few seconds on to their journey and the whole process would be much safer. Still, some pass like shit anyway, even if there is room.

There are things to be learnt on both sides, but I believe that it should be the person in charge of the 2 tonne metal box that applies the extra caution and patience and that there should be a much larger focus on vulnerable road users during driver training. If something goes wrong then it's not going to be the motorist that comes off worse.

I also wouldn't go for licensing all road users (even though only a small fraction don't have them). I can see where you're coming from, but I don't think it's the solution. Cycling is a fantastic means of transport, and the fact that anyone can take it up just makes it better. I do feel that if a cycling proficiency course would be compulsory part of a primary school curriculum then we'd see great benefits as a nation. I know that doing one helped my competence on the road greatly. But with that I think we need to come a long way as a society in the way we treat cycling. Societal pressure and the current state of infrastructure promote poor practices (such as cycling in the gutter and passing on the left).

Did you know that the official recommended width for a bike lane is 3 metres? I didn't until recently. No bike lane I've seen has even come close to half that. We need to stop our us vs them mentality. We need segregation in busy areas. Take away space from cars and put it towards cycling in cities and this nation will see massive improvements; lower congestion and a healthier nation. But we won't because cars. Cars are the thing our society clings to, and anyone who doesn't is an outsider.

I ended up going on a bit of a tangent there, so I apologise for that, but I really feel that if this country stopped treating cycling as something only kids and enthusiasts do then we'll all be much better off.",0,1392216737,null,0,false,0,cfdfz3w,t3_1xn0po,t1_cfdfz3w,t1_cfddu75,null,1432364636,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,ikkleste,eng-yorkshire,Something like Yorkshire,"Aye I think it's just the way it played out. While it was the Levels it was about one story a day on the news on PM on radio four. Pretty much ""yep, Somerset is still flooded."".

Gradually this built up, kinda getting on towards ""wow, Somerset is *still* flooded. Then it got political with Farage jumping into the spotlight to raise something irrelevant, and there being a bit of interagency blame game going on with the EA. It's been on a ramp up since about last Wednesdays PMQs. Finally it got to levels of headline news. R4PM covering not only with a couple of stories in the news but 15 mins features every day too. Then the prime minister got involved, on pretty much the same day that it it became clear the Thames was going to bust its banks.

This makes it look as though DC has jumped in at the first mention of the home counties.

It really does though. Somerset has been underwater for weeks, York has dealt with years of flooding, Hull had massive flooding. Each of these gets passing reference second story on the news level coverage. When the south east gets hit, suddenly it's headline stuff. It might be just unfortunate timing but Cameron jumping in as it hits the south east makes it look like that's what it takes for this to get addressed. Why wasn't Cameron commenting on this as extensively last week? or before Christmas? Or last time York flooded?

So the real question is, as Cameron jumped into the debate now, because:

a) Four weeks isn't too long for and area to be cut off but five weeks is?

b) It's become a political hot potato due the EA blame game and UKIP UKIPing?

c) It's hit the back yard of his core voters?

or 

d) We've been under investing in flood defences for years despite warnings and extensive misery for thousands and something has changed?

I'd suggest it's obviously a bit of each, but mostly b. When really it should be wholly d and should have been years ago. Thankfully now b has happened, a should get some badly needed attention, and hopefully d (though i'm not going to hold my breath.)",0,1392217009,null,0,1392218514,0,cfdg2ni,t3_1xpa05,t1_cfdg2ni,t1_cfdfc6r,null,1432364683,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I'm also perfectly aware the poll I quoted is soft and the question asked in a different manner would change the results, the nature of polling was ever thus, but please don't try and convince me somehow it's less valid contribution than your anecdotal evidence. 

Now I'm sure the parties will be busy conducting their own polling to see what plays best with rUK voters but simultaneously they have to make judgements on how their position impact the referendum campaign. Last nights BBC Scotland polls on the impact of currency on the debate showed only 4% of those polled felt it to be most important factor in the debate. It seems to those taking the decisions on independence it's not as big an issue as the headlines suggest. What is likely to be a bigger issue is another negative coming from the Better Together camp.

Again, I completely disagree. Hazard puts plenty of effort into getting back on defense. Sometimes to a fault because he looks completely gassed by the end of a match.

&gt;Nearly every time Chelsea drop points this season it's because of our inability to score, rather than a lack of defensive pressure.

We have plenty of people at the midfield position who can create chances. Hazard has been scoring incredibly well as of late. Mata did not provide any more offensive firepower than any of our other midfielders.

true,[deleted],null,null,"No you haven't - you've presented crappy stats from America that dont even support your points (where there are 300 millions firearms, and that have been widely available for decades &amp; decades) - there is little that gun control can do in America without 50 years of firearms destructions and widespread consent (which will never happen). In the UK we have less than 1% of that number of firearms, and strong gun control already. 

The US and the UK have similar levels of violent crime (in fact the UK rates higher in some stats) but the UK has vastly lower murders - and specifically vastly lower rates of firearm murder. So what that demonstrates (to what extent you can demonstrate it) is a gun control country vs non gun control country (with comparable underlying crime levels) and that prolonged and universal gun control has absolutely kept the murder rate down - and not by a bit by by a huge amount. 

http://www.nationmaster.com/compare/United-Kingdom/United-States/Crime

In response to your *brilliant* stats - you can't compare countries with wildly different demographics and underlying crime rates (e.g. murders are low in switzerland because all crime is low - they don't commit a lot of crime - and they have a culture of universal gun training, rich population and distinct lack of poverty). Stats from the NRA...! Very amusing but of course the USA has open borders between states and millions of illegal firearms so the differences between gun control between states is irrelevant. The last one is funniest because it shows the USA (the most developed economy on the planet?) with a ludicrously high murder rate. The fact that the number of guns per person is also high isnt even relevant - it just a demonstration that there is a ludicrously high number of guns in circulation. The fact that there isn't a linear relationship between the number of guns and the murder rate is irrelevant IF THE MURDER RATE IS REALLY REALLY HIGH ANYWAY. What a dumb chart to argue your point with.   

There are lots of other stats to show you but I cannot be fucked because up until now you've just been make juvenile and crackpot observations about bathtubs, swimming pools, homeopathy, the daily mail and now climate change - in a desperate attempt to somehow deny the obvious general consensus that some dog breeds are more dangerous than others, and the most extreme examples are rightfully banned.

He played like god untill he was 18. After his 18 birthday bum, stoped developing, injured himself and couldnt find to his previous form. This happends often. mainly to England players. Right now, it looks like Ibe (if you count him as a youth player) could be the best, he has the potential. Rossiter, Kent, yan dhanda, Wilson, Ojo all of them have the potential but its to soon to tell if they will be the best.

2. Thanks to Rafa. Rafa Benitez revived our academy. When he came here he said that our academy was in horrible shape. So he appointed 3 people. Borrell, Jose Segura (both from Barcelona) and Frank McParland. [Borrell says academy 'was unacceptable' ](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/liverpool/8611991.stm).

true,Popeychops,eng-Oxfordshire,Southern Softie,"&gt;hreatening to shoot yourself in the foot (leading economists and even Mark Carney have said the currency union would be best for both countries. This isn't a Germany/Greece situation) in order to scare Scottish voters is not exactly what I'd call a proper way of treating your own citizens. And as much as you seem to hate us we are still part of the same country as of yet.

Sources please, on these ""leading economists"" and this alleged hatred.

Personally, I don't think the SNP are treating the Scottish people well. The ""Yes"" vote has two critical economic promises: currency union and European Union. The two are incompatible, [since the EU requires all new members to join the Euro.](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/adoption/who_can_join/)

Neither of the two are certain, but Salmond promises them both as if he has everything under his control. This is insanity. You are gambling your economic future on the ideology of a man who holds contempt for the British, as far as to [politicise](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02611/cameron-andy-murra_2611352b.jpg) sporting [events.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/london-2012-olympics-live/9430304/Alex-Salmond-Lets-cheer-on-Scolympians-instead-of-Team-GB.html) I regret that both of my sources are the Daily Telegraph, I do not care for the editorialism of the latter article and only wish to draw your attention to what is quoted.

&gt;It is an insult to our intelligence and capabilities. And frankly it's exactly the sort of discrimination which made me stop considering myself British after moving to England.

It is not, it is an insult to your elected leadership. They are the ones insulting your intelligence and capabilities. I'm sorry for the loss of your former national identity. If you do get your way and become independent, expect a precarious decade of economic woes and re-union when the Scottish Labour Party (which intends to remain unionist) takes over and pushes for a reversal by another referendum.

I hope the Scottish people vote ""No"" for two reasons: I want speculation on the UK's future to end definitively, because uncertainty is bad for economic growth. And I want the UK to keep its current borders because they look prettier on the map. Scotland's GVA (Gross Value Added) per capita is [not significantly different](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countries_of_the_United_Kingdom_by_GVA_per_capita) from the UK average and is, in fact, lower than England's average. Once North Sea oil runs dry ([which peaked in 1999](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea_oil#Reserves_and_production)) Scotland will have to ameliorate a greater proportional loss in income than the rest of the UK. We will do just fine without Scotland, so I'm not particularly worried about my future.

My point is, statistically Morrison probably won't end up as anything special, and if he doesn't want to play for whatever reason (arrogance/indifference/money) it probably would be better to cash in on him. I would really like to be proven wrong, and Morrison clearly is very talented, but history combined with his terrible attitude leads me to be pessimistic :( It would be a shame to get rid of one of the few young players with a shred of talent in the squad, but (especially for a relegation battle) there's no point in fielding someone who isn't willing to give 100%.",0,1392221226,null,0,false,0,cfdhr8o,t3_1xp6wx,t1_cfdhr8o,t3_1xp6wx,null,1432365477,6,false,Hammers,t5_2sco3,6

http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/fiscal-commission-advocates-currency-union-with-england-after-independence.20171001

*The findings, the product of a year's work by four respected economists including Nobel winner Joseph Stiglitz, are an attempt to define the broad economic framework of a Scotland outside the UK.*

*Although the content is academic in tone, the timing of the publication is highly political, as it clashes with the first major report from the Coalition on the hazards of independence.*

*Looking ahead to the Fiscal Commission's report, its chair Crawford Beveridge said: ""In our view, it would be in Scotland's interests to retain sterling immediately post-independence.*

*""It would benefit the rest of the UK to maintain a key trading partner as nearly 10% of the existing UK economy Scotland would remain one of the largest trading partners of the UK economy. Scotland's economy is strong enough and sufficiently aligned with the rest of the UK that a separate currency would not be necessary.""*


I misremembered on Carney, but he [refused to say that it was a bad idea, merely pointing out the controls that needed to be in place for it to work](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dc0b3a90-88df-11e3-bb5f-00144feab7de.html).

&gt;this alleged hatred.

The entire attitude of this thread is the Scots should get out and keep our grubby hands off the pound and not one person is citing academic sources to say that it'd be bad for England. Because the academic sources, above, say the opposite. Therefore I conclude it's spite rather than facts which are driving the debate. 

&gt;Personally, I don't think the SNP are treating the Scottish people well. The ""Yes"" vote has two critical economic promises: currency union and European Union. The two are incompatible, since the EU requires all new members to join the Euro.

No, the EU requires you sign up to join the Euro at some point in the future. You can just say ""yes, we'll join the Euro"" and then not. Which several countries have done. 

&gt;You are gambling your economic future on the ideology of a man who holds contempt for the British,

And the alternative is the Westminster Elite who hold contempt for everything beyond the M25. I don't think that Salmond has contempt for the British, in fact, the opposite seems to be true. [Here he is answering most of your arguments whilst being shouted over by a C4 presenter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkZIu6LiPRA).

&gt; as far as to politicise sporting events. I regret that both of my sources are the Daily Telegraph, I do not care for the editorialism of the latter article and only wish to draw your attention to what is quoted.

Of course Cameron would never politicise sporting events, right? 

&gt;Once North Sea oil runs dry (which peaked in 1999) Scotland will have to ameliorate a greater proportional loss in income than the rest of the UK. We will do just fine without Scotland, so I'm not particularly worried about my future. I am, however, worried about yours.

North Sea Oil is past peak production but not past peak revenue. It'll be a big earner for a long time. And how gracious of you to deign to continue funding us once the oil runs out.

Other, non-flood-plain buyers of insurance thus pick up the slack, effectively forcing a subsidy from those who *didn't* buy houses on floodplains, and usually paid significantly more for the privilege. Since home insurance is pretty much mandatory in modern society, it's effectively a tax on the prudent. 

[1] from the [Government policy document on floods](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/reducing-the-threats-of-flooding-and-coastal-change): ""*The preferred approach would protect many of those most at risk by in effect capping flood insurance premiums. The proposal would mean that premiums would be set according to property values and that people will know the maximum they could be asked to pay.*

*To fund this, a new industry-backed levy would enable insurance companies to cover those at most risk of flooding. All UK household insurers would have to pay into this pool, creating a fund that can be used to pay claims for people in high-risk homes. In the meantime, we’ve published a guide to help people to get affordable insurance.*""

true,Popeychops,eng-Oxfordshire,Southern Softie,"&gt;The findings, the product of a year's work by four respected economists...

Very nice, actually quite a decent and balanced article.

&gt;The entire attitude of this thread is the Scots should get out and keep our grubby hands off the pound and not one person is citing academic sources to say that it'd be bad for England. Because the academic sources, above, say the opposite. Therefore I conclude it's spite rather than facts which are driving the debate.

You'd conclude wrong, most of the objections in this thread are suggesting that currency union would be bad for Scotland, not bad for England. There has been enough sourcing of SNP and UK treasury statements for my liking. Please drop these silly ""persecution"" claims. You really are not being discriminated against. Do you believe that the ""Yes"" campaign is altogether free from spite? Aren't you being quite spiteful in this post?

&gt;No, the EU requires you sign up to join the Euro at some point in the future. You can just say ""yes, we'll join the Euro"" and then not. Which several countries have done.

Perhaps you should have read the European Commission's own webpage that I provided you the link to.

&gt;And the alternative is the Westminster Elite who hold contempt for everything beyond the M25. I don't think that Salmond has contempt for the British, in fact, the opposite seems to be true. Here he is not answering most of your arguments whilst being shouted over by a C4 presenter[3] .

FTFY. And ""London is terrible"" again. As someone who lives in the South of England, I can't explain the criticism of London's dominance of the UK economy as anything other than jealousy. There is a very similar effect in Scotland with Glasgow and Edinburgh. London is not some paradise, those of us who do live beyond the M25 don't have our best and brightest forcibly relocated to become some corporate slave. London has many problems which are common to the UK, but ramped up to 11. Affordable housing and crime, for example.

Can you actually tell me what's so great about London? What seems so good about it's political situation that isn't shared by the whole of the south of England?

&gt;Of course Cameron would never politicise sporting events, right?

No source, just a petulant ""Someone else did it first!""

Please don't argue a case you don't have.

&gt;North Sea Oil is past peak production but not past peak revenue. It'll be a big earner for a long time. And how gracious of you to deign to continue funding us once the oil runs out. Don't you think it would be better for Scotland to go it's own way and sort it's economy out? I see no prospect of Westminster doing so.

Peak revenue? You mean somehow you'll get more money with less product? Either you're suggesting you'll increase taxes levied (not good for an aspiring tax-haven) or you're forgetting the effect of inflation.

I don't see such a prospect either, I'm just commenting that you'll be worse off without the UK than within.",0,1392222580,null,0,false,0,cfdid56,t3_1xp1wp,t1_cfdid56,t1_cfdhrdo,null,1432365793,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Which to a point is true. When your biggest concern is making it to your bar job roughly around the time you were supposed to be there, or not spacing out and forgetting to buy milk before the store closes, smoking weed on a regular basis is easy to do. When you have a professional job, your married, you have bills to not only pay but organize and a million other things to do, smoking weed on a regular basis is much harder if not impossible to do. 

&gt; They believe the media claims that the drugs are now markedly stronger (and therefore more dangerous) than ever.

I think many people believe that because if you use it on a regular basis your tolerance grows quite quickly. So if you were the type of person who could smoke a king sized joint before going to work, then you eventually stop smoking for years, the next time you try to smoke an entire joint to yourself it's going to mess you up. Obviously you don't want to think of yourself as a lightweight because you have fond memories of smoking an ounce a week to yourself, so the only other answer is that the drug is simply much stronger than it used to be.",0,1392222699,null,0,false,0,cfdif4v,t3_1xpju2,t1_cfdif4v,t1_cfdg6nk,null,1432365829,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

There has been enough sourcing of SNP and UK treasury statements for my liking. Please drop these silly ""persecution"" claims. You really are not being discriminated against. Do you believe that the ""Yes"" campaign is altogether free from spite? Aren't you being quite spiteful in this post?

Well it's easier to not see something that isn't aimed at you right? 

&gt;Perhaps you should have read the European Commission's own webpage that I provided you the link to.

I didn't need to but it's right there:

*Sweden is not yet in the euro area, as it has not made the necessary changes to its central bank legislation and it does not meet the convergence criterion related to participation in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II). However, under the Treaty, Sweden is required to adopt the euro.*

You can just continue to not meet the convergence criterion.

&gt;And the alternative is the Westminster Elite who hold contempt for everything beyond the M25. I don't think that Salmond has contempt for the British, in fact, the opposite seems to be true. Here he is not answering most of your arguments whilst being shouted over by a C4 presenter[3] .

How droll. 

&gt;As someone who lives in the South of England, I can't explain the criticism of London's dominance of the UK economy as anything other than jealousy.

http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/10/public-money-private-wealth-london-north-v-south?commentpage=1

&gt;No source, just a petulant ""Someone else did it first!""

&gt;Please don't argue a case you don't have.

Sport *is* political. If it wasn't, the Olympics wouldn't be segregated by country. My point is, it's a non-criticism. 

&gt;Peak revenue? You mean somehow you'll get more money with less product? Either you're suggesting you'll increase taxes levied (not good for an aspiring tax-haven) or you're forgetting the effect of inflation.

Supply and Demand. Oil supply is going down whilst demand skyrockets. The price of oil is vastly more now than in the past, and tax is linked to oil price. I'm looking for a publicly available source on this, most of mine are in the industry.

&gt;McClaren is a modern-day technical coach, working on shapes and formations, studying tapes and Pro Zone charts. His meticulous preparation for games knocks Mark Hughes' oft-mentioned version into a cocked hat.

I sincerely hope Fernandes et al. find someone similar for the next top man. I worry that detractors who claim he is too obsessed by big names are on the mark, and we'll get someone like Sven in next.

&gt;Gary O'Neil is a regular fall guy – removed at half time on three of his last five starts and after 54 minutes in the game before that and subbed early again here. What's that old line about the definition of insanity being repetition of the same action while expecting different results?

Wasn't a mindblowing signing over the Summer, and to be honest this deep into the season have never thought he brings too much to the party. Giving him a start on the wing over Hoilett, Traoré or even SWP just baffles me. As does the midfield as a whole. I'm not sure why he's switched it up to the 4-4-2 formation now - I think getting more familiarity with the 5 man midfield might have been worth it. As others have said, putting Carroll in the middle of a four man midfield just looks clueless.

I wonder when Onuoha is going to get his chance again? He's young and on a longer contract than Hill and Dunne. Starving him of playing time in his primary position seems a bit short sighted. We don't want another Jamie Mackie exit on our hands.

true,HedonisticVibrations,null,null,"Yeah that fat number 5 is McNulty, great conference level centre half who people tend to underestimate because lets face it, he is a fat bastard. Love him though. 

With our chances Gray always does that, hardly ever see him score a goal where he doesn't absolutely try to leather the thing which can be frustrating but actually works quite well a lot of the time! The other one I think was from Ruddock-Mpanzu who is actually a centre half by trade but we are converting him to midfield and while I think he is quality he is still raw and blows extremely hot or cold with seemingly nothing in between so that might explain the blazing miss! 

You are right about the second half, I was on edge for most of it sounded like you were playing really well and we were a bit off our game but guess we can get away with that when we have a keeper like Mark Tyler to bail us out when needed.

Ha they do that all the time with shirts. Must be because we are all southern softies! 

Not sure about that budget stat, we have the lowest budget we have ever had in our ""conference era"", I have no doubt it is far higher than yours and still may be the highest in the league but 8 times yours I highly, highly doubt. Just read this on another forum that if you had a budget of £400,000 (not entirely unreasonable) then ours would be over 3 million. I cannot see that being the case. 

Hope we can continue this, this would be the worst of the lot if we didnt go up now I think. For you guys the results didnt go your way really last night with Alfreton and Salisbury but if you play like you did last night then you have every chance. Think we are incredibly lucky to have taken 4 points off you when you maybe should have beaten us both times!

 [**Moon illusion**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon%20illusion): 

---

&gt;

&gt;The **Moon illusion** is an [optical illusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_illusion) in which the [Moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) appears larger near the [horizon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon) than it does while higher up in the [sky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky). This optical illusion also occurs with the [Sun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) and [star constellations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation). It has been known since ancient times and recorded by various cultures. The explanation of this illusion is still debated.

Well you see you didn't clarify what you meant be infrastructure. I thought you meant transport as transport is what you referenced. And transport is already handled by [Transport Scotland](http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/).

This is a great example of a bad article trying to cherry pick evidence to support its conclusion. It's no coincidence that London is the largest subdivision on any map by population, so overspending within it will do more good than spending equally on all regions by population. [Its economy is so much bigger than the rest of the UK that investment there will quickly pay for itself in growth.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-25879681) It really isn't London's fault for being economically successful. Arguing that things should be different is jealousy.

&gt;Sport is political. If it wasn't, the Olympics wouldn't be segregated by country. My point is, it's a non-criticism.

No, sport is apolitical. NOC Rule 50.3:

&gt;No kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.

&gt;Supply and Demand. Oil supply is going down whilst demand skyrockets. The price of oil is vastly more now than in the past, and tax is linked to oil price. I'm looking for a publicly available source on this, most of mine are in the industry.
Investment is still high: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21564947[2]

Is the price of Oil in 2020 going to be 3x greater than the price in 1999?

Norway has equivalent oil wealth to the UK, but less than 10% of its population. This is not an adequate comparison since an equal fund would yield £10,000 per person. When you consider that spending on extraction would have generated expenditure deficits in the UK budget, it no longer looks such an attractive prospect to have instituted a rainy-day  fund over spending straight away.

It would have been great if we could have saved like Norway. But we are not Norway. Where's Scotland's oil fund?",0,1392225343,null,0,false,0,cfdjof0,t3_1xp1wp,t1_cfdjof0,t1_cfdit22,null,1432366381,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"Yes, although that in itself isn't a big deal, what banks do in return is.

Where there's a prospect of a correction then banks will restrict lending based on equity, charging a premium where there's not enough equity to ensure that a reposession means they don't lose (much) money.

At the moment there's a significant premium where LTV is over ~70%. 

For a 10% deposit (typical for first time buyers) the premium is around 2%.

Assuming an average purchase price for a FTB of 200K, which means a 180K advance, which means 3.60K extra interest per year, assuming 30% total tax, that's over £5K extra that you need to earn in comparison to someone with a huge deposit (typically someone 50+).

The more certainty there is about house prices the less that figure becomes - in fact if you look back to '06 you'll find that there was barely any LTV risk based pricing.

House prices just now are very high relative to wages because of scarcity. If that scarcity is solved overnight then house prices will also correct overnight. So far the government pretty much only restrict themselves to making it easier to buy houses, which of course increases prices. 

If the government came out with a scheme which forced local authorities to build houses, but did it in such a way that it was tied to house prices - in other words if they rise by x% then %y extra houses are needed, and tinker with it over time to get it just right then that should remove the fear of a correction, so reduce the premium that people pay.

I strongly disagree with this. Regardless of their form, it's hard to deny that United has the talent in their squad for an impressive final stretch and a top four finish. They certainly haven't looked like they're capable of playing on that level yet this year, but don't you think an away victory over Arsenal could change that? 

Moyes's tactics are still going to be crap, probably, but you can see from the performance of this squad last year (or Liverpool's squad this year so far) that mentality plays a huge role in getting these results. And I can't think of a more surefire way to boost United's morale and help them regain that winning mentality than by giving them an away victory over the team that's been top of the league almost all season.

Arsenal have a hard run of games regardless of how this United game goes. I'd much rather see them win this one and then drop points at Stoke or Chelsea later down the line. ",0,1392225630,null,0,false,0,cfdjtfi,t3_1xp4xf,t1_cfdjtfi,t1_cfdcgs4,null,1432366451,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I don't need to source myself for my own perceptions on the tone of this thread. I'm not so famous as to have academics analysing my every statement (except when I'm presenting papers, of course). 

But as I already pointed out the failure to cite is now especially lacking on the anti-currency union side, since I posted that article making the case for it.

&gt;It really isn't London's fault for being economically successful. Arguing that things should be different is jealousy.

It is a vicious cycle of inward investment fostering inward growth, even the article you posted points this out:

*London appears to ""suck talent from the rest of the country"", the report says, with many young people never returning to their home towns.*

London makes a lot of money so invest more so London makes more money, so people are drawn there from other regions, so invest more...

I think we need to break away from it to direct our own investment.

&gt;No, sport is apolitical. NOC Rule 50.3:

&gt;Is the price of Oil in 2020 going to be 3x greater than the price in 1999?

[Mate, it already is.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_petroleum) And it's been up at 5x as much in 2008 and 2011.

&gt;Norway has equivalent oil wealth to the UK, but less than 10% of its population. This is not an adequate comparison since an equal fund would yield £10,000 per person. When you consider that spending on extraction would have generated expenditure deficits in the UK budget, it no longer looks such an attractive prospect to have instituted a rainy-day fund over spending straight away.

But Norway *does* have an equivalent population to Scotland, so it's a reasonable comparison looking forward. 

&gt;Where's Scotland's oil fund?

No, we want to build a nation which better suits Scottish ideals.

Exasterbated, no doubt, by Aberdeen being one of very few cities in the UK of that size having *no* pedestrianised centre.](http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/2222359)

[They even considered charging people to get into the centre of town, due to a lack of funding partially caused by *no one going to Aberdeen city centre!*](http://www.aberdeen-info.co.uk/weblog/files/53ec1e3f6198cf1454df6e382caadc46-161.php#.UvuzLmJ_t1Y)

It is entirely seemly for the government to step in and over-rule a council known for inaction and incompetence, when it has just turned down a proposal for the kind of tourist attractions that Aberdeen desperately needs.

&gt;And it did lose us money. Allowing the proposal to be reconsidered cost money, there are also the legal fees for several years of getting him out.

How much was that? Do you have a figure? Just curious.

&gt;Salmond is an absolute idiot for doing this. Defending him on this goes against all reason and evidence, and if you're doing so it's through rose-tinted glasses because you like the man's policies.

Fact of the matter is, that if it were *anyone* other than Trump, then Salmond would be regarded as a hero in this matter. As it is, you can only blame him for believing Trump, *as the vast majority of Scots did.*

2. There are open borders in Europe as well. If your open border theory was true we would still be seeing the nations/states with most guns/least restrictive controls topping the gun violence charts. Except we still don't.

3. You have not demonstrated that gun control works, just that the US has more gun murders than us.

4. If your stance of ""more guns =/= more murders/violence"" then could you please explain the following:

I have presented data that compared 50 US states to one another, 30 odd european nations to one another, and 30 odd OECD nations to one another. There is no correlation. 

Why do you dismiss such comparisons? We judge states/nations when discussing healthcare, education, but suddenly not crime. Is it because the results are inconvenient for you? 

You have absolutely no evidence that the gun control theory works. I ask you what is wrong with adding further types of firearms to our licensing system? You haven't presented any evidence that gun crime will rise.

Why should law abiding citizens be penalised because of knee jerk hysterical fools like you who ignore evidence?

Scotland could relocate to a pacific island and eat coconuts all day and sleep in tents it would still ""exist"".

you seem to have no understanding of how a minority population in an independent state sharing an island with a much more wealthy and populous majority would be impacted by a dissolved union between them?

you think The rUK will give any consideration what so ever to Scotland and its issues post devolution?, you think your country is resilient to misfortune (e,g extreme weather), the UK wont bail it out.

you seem to know very little, about economic theory and principles, taking just one area (can be bothered to explain more) your argument is like taking the cost and employment spending  of large ship contracts in Scotland thinking ""wow we made £1billion out of that, we don't need the UK we are making loads building ships"",

All the time completely unaware that these ship contracts are specifically awarded within the union because it makes economic sense. £10 spent in the union is better than £10 spent outside it. post devolution Scotland no longer makes any sense and has to compete on price only and being Scotland cannot compete so loses that entire industry. and all those pay packets, and then claim unemployment from the Scottish government. 

and the smaller you are the less stable and easy it is to unbalance and cripple  them financially, you will still exist, but Scotland will be a husk of what it was.

(1) In this Act ""terrorism"" means the use or threat of action where-
(a) the action falls within subsection (2),
(b) the use or threat is designed to influence the government [or an international governmental organisation][3] or to intimidate the public or a section of the public, and
(c) the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious [, racial][4] or ideological cause.
(2) Action falls within this subsection if it-
(a) involves serious violence against a person,
(b) involves serious damage to property,
(c) endangers a person's life, other than that of the person committing the action,
(d) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public, or
(e) is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system.


So (and apologies to Mark Thomas here) Greenpeace stopping a whaling ship is terrorism. GM crop protestors damaging crops is terrorism. Ramblers on a trespass can be considered terrorists now...

Yes, but the fact that opposition to the course was very small scale, and had little to no support outside of those concerned with the environmental implications.

true,Galerath,null,null,"&gt;so you cant understand how an entire country entirely funded by finite oil, cant continue to enjoy the standard of living it does today indefinitely.

You seem to be under the illusion that Scotland is entirely funded by oil. 

[This is not true](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2013/06/9241/)

&gt;the fact you think ""exist"" is the only criteria for success will perhaps explain why i don't entertain or answer your ludicrous questions.

I think if it can go it alone at roughly the same level of prosperity or more, it'll do well. Nobody is seriously doubting that Scotland can achieve that, except you. So you need to back those assertions up.

&gt;you seem to have no understanding of how a minority population in an independent state sharing an island with a much more wealthy and populous majority would be impacted by a dissolved union between them?

Except it isn't true that Scotland under performs in this union. [Scotland has a higher GDP per capita than any other country in the Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Scotland). This isn't a minority, poor population seceding from a majority rich one. This is a wealthy minority deciding to leave a similarly wealthy economy. 

[Leading economists have said that Scotland's economy is strong and aligned with the rest of the UK, which is why a currency union could work.](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/fiscal-commission-advocates-currency-union-with-england-after-independence.20171001)

&gt;you think The rUK will give any consideration what so ever to Scotland and its issues post devolution?, you think your country is resilient to misfortune (e,g extreme weather), the UK wont bail it out.

Scotland's deficit would be similar to rUK, and it has a strong, diversified economy. It would be sufficiently resilient to misfortune, and less prone to it, being cut off from the heavily exposed City of London. In the event a bailout was needed, Scotland would receive money from the European bailout fund. But nobody is suggesting Scotland would need a bailout.

rUK would have to pay some attention to Scotland due to it being a fellow EU state, a major trading partner, and an ally. 

&gt;you seem to know very little, about economic theory and principles, taking just one area (can be bothered to explain more) your argument is like taking the cost and employment spending of large ship contracts in Scotland thinking ""wow we made £1billion out of that, we don't need the UK we are making loads building ships"",

I don't think I make any analogous arguments. But we can also run that argument the other way: rUK depends greatly on Scotland's economy, but you seem to think that rUK would erect a massive wall at the border, cut all ties and threaten to shoot deserters. Yet this would be A: Against international Law, and B: harmful to England's economy. [Same report as earlier: ""as nearly 10% of the existing UK economy Scotland would remain one of the largest trading partners of the UK economy""](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/referendum-news/fiscal-commission-advocates-currency-union-with-england-after-independence.20171001)

&gt;and the smaller you are the less table and easy it is to unbalance and cripple them financially, you will still exist, but Scotland will be a husk of what it was.

And who would actively be trying to cripple Scotland? Do you think rUK would try to destroy a fellow EU nation? This isn't 1707 you know. We live in a globalised world. Trying to undermine Scotland would serve no economic purpose for rUK, it would only harm it economically and politically to be seen to be actively trying to destroy its former constituent state.

&gt;although that in itself isn't a big deal, what banks do in return is.

People are saying that some banks will be insolvent because they have lent against property prices which would fall. 

&gt;At the moment there's a significant premium where LTV is over ~70%.

So the banks think there's going to be a correction?

&gt;Assuming an average purchase price for a FTB of 200K, which means a 180K advance, which means 3.60K extra interest per year, assuming 30% total tax, that's over £5K extra that you need to earn in comparison to someone with a huge deposit (typically someone 50+).

But once the correction happens, the premium would presumably disappear, so most people would be unaffected?

We have a strange system over here, where they televise very few games.

We usually get 2 on a Saturday, and 2/3 on a Sunday (3rd Sunday game is actually Monday night mostly nowadays).
They show 2 games midweek, Tues and Wed, on certain game weeks.

Never (that I'm aware of) are EPL games shown on red button, or simultaneously. None of the 3pm kick offs are televised. 

All done to encourage you to go watch your local team (I think that's the general reason).

true,mejogid,cnty-uk,London,"&gt; New Orleans was a one off. These are houses built in daft places.

I normally agree with what you have to say but this is an astounding level of bullshit and I really don't know why you're asserting something you clearly have no idea about. New Orleans is built in the middle of a huge flood plain of the fourth largest river on earth and [51% of the city is below sea level](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans#Geography). The entire area is only livable and farmable because of huge feats of engineering and giant levees along the river - it has [3,500 miles of levees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levee#River_flood_prevention) that average 7.3m in height and get as high as 15m in populated areas.

It's a case study in how much you can engineer a river system if you really want to. It's an entire city built in the *daftest* of places, but it's only had one major incident in recent history - primarily due to poor engineering of flood defences. If New Orleans can exist then we could defend the entire country from floods quite comfortably - it's a question of whether we want to pay the financial or environmental cost.",0,1392230780,null,0,false,0,cfdmeji,t3_1xplei,t1_cfdmeji,t1_cfditkk,null,1432367732,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

true,Galerath,null,null,"&gt;Ok so its pretty clear you are very much incapable of understanding economics

&gt;despite the ship example being explained at length you still cant grasp the basics.

&gt;you also think Scotland is automatically an ally and trading partner. oh and you also assume it automatically becomes an EU state (it doesnt it takes time it has to apply)

&gt;Its not in the UK interest to support Scotland it is in the UK interest to cripple Scotland financially and then take its assets below their value.

&gt;you nativity is truly awe inspiring.

That's not how macroeconomics works. I would quote you some Adam Smith, but his works are in my office and I'm at home. So [Paul A. Samuelson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_A_Samuelson) will have to do:

*""The principle of comparative advantage holds that a country can benefit from trade even it it is absolutely more efficient (or absolutely less efficient) than other countries in the production of every good. Indeed, trade according to comparative advantage provides mutual benefits to all countries.""* Paul A Samuelson. *Economics* 19th Edition (2010). p.341. Section on International Trade. 

Comparative advantage is the foundation of macroeconomics. Countries eek out specialisations and then trade for mutual benefit.

In other words, international trade is for mutual benefit, not to 'cripple other countries financially and then take their assets below their value'. In fact, in modern, liberal capitalist societies, it's not even the business of Government to attempt such things. And I'd challenge you to cite any examples of a nationstate economically crippling another nation state on purpose in the last 20 years. Given how many small countries there are, like Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, I'm sure that'll be easy for you if you're correct.

*edit:* Actually I thought of one! Isreal and Palestine. But if you think the Scotland/rUK situation would be anything like that mess... well then you have an even worse grasp on the situation than you think I have.",0,1392231227,null,0,1392232540,0,cfdmmpe,t3_1xp1wp,t1_cfdmmpe,t1_cfdm83j,null,1432367839,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Tbickle,flair1,,"Yes.

&gt;Eriksen - 53 passes/90 minutes average - 81% success rate.

&gt;Bentaleb - 65 passes/90 minutes average - 87% success rate.

&gt;Dembele - 66 passes/90 minutes average - 90% success rate.

In terms of pure stats Dembele is our best passer, not Eriksen or Bentaleb.  Just for posterity...

&gt;Paulinho - 51/game - 83%

&gt;Sandro - 57/game - 84%

&gt;Capoue - 64/game - 84%

&gt;Townsend - 39/game - 85%

&gt;Lennon - 32/game - 82%

The other thing to consider is the type of passing the person does. Eriksen is probably the most creative and forward-thinking passer we have, but the stats don't look that impressive compared to others. Yes, Bentaleb has a lot of passes per game and a high success rate, but a lot of his passing is horizontal and rarely has any impact on creating chances. 

We are sorely in need of a DM right now with Sandro out and I just don't understand why TS is trying to fill that void with Bentaleb now that Capoue is healthy again. here is the comparison:

&gt;Capoue

&gt;15 Appearances - 1000 minutes

&gt;39 Clearances (3.5/90 min. Average)

&gt;28 Tackles (2.5/90 avg.)

&gt;713 Passes (64/90 avg.)- 84% accuracy

&gt;9 Shots (.8/90 avg.) - 83% accuracy

vs.

&gt;Bentaleb

&gt;9 Appearances - 633 minutes

&gt;10 Clearances (1.4/90 min. Average)

&gt;23 Tackles (3.2/90 avg.)

&gt;455 Passes (65/90 avg.) - 87% accuracy

&gt;5 Shots (.7/90 avg.) - 75% accuracy

Yes, Bentaleb is a talented kid and he's been instrumental in some games lately, so I'm not slating him. That being said, he's not the most talented midfielder we have, not the best passer, and the spot we are trying to fill with him could be filled with a better option.

true,Halk,scot-lanarkshire,Lanarkshire,"&gt;People are saying that some banks will be insolvent because they have lent against property prices which would fall.

Possibly, I know that there's differences between banks - Halifax in particular are rumoured have a relatively poor book - so perhaps there would be some issues there which unfortunately consumers end up taking on. Perhaps it is a bit self destructive of me, but I'd rather not have any more bailouts if possible... let them go under.

In balance probably no correction is expected, but there's a small chance of one (the difference has decreased a fair bit). 

If there was to be a correction and repossessions then banks would lose a large amount on properties with LTVs over 70%, so the 2% premium represents the risk of loss. Also by the time the bank does take back a house they've lost money too, and the higher your LTV the less chance of sorting it out on your own there is. 

If a correction was to happen then a significant amount of people would be in negative equity, there's also the prospect that if the government sorted the supply issue overnight that house prices simply would not recover. As things stand now house prices have always recovered, and relatively quickly. ",0,1392231419,null,0,false,0,cfdmqa6,t3_1xlsfl,t1_cfdmqa6,t1_cfdm7y8,null,1432367885,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Calavera190,scottish,Fife,"&gt;Well 6000 jobs were promised and 200 were made. I would imagine that would have been a violation of any such contract.

But that's only arisen as a result of the windfarm thing. It promised 6000 jobs, to build and staff the course, hotel, clubhouse and provide 400 houses. To date *only* the course has been built, because Trump has refused to finish construction. 

The whole reason Trump did so was because he felt ""betrayed"" by Salmond, presumably because he felt the contract ensured he would have things just the way he wanted them. That's still not proof no contract existed, do you have a source on that claim?

&gt;Using executive power to push something through means you better have pretty good evidence for it being a good idea

It's impossible to have evidence that something would be good or bad before it's been built. Lacking that, the promise of 6000 jobs was the positive factor in the course's favour. 

&gt; a lot against it such as the environmental damage, Trump's history etc.

Was there anything other than those two things? I don't think there is. Even then, Trump's history is no indication of how *this* specific venture would have failed. A golf course and hotel in Scotland provides a reasonably safe return, in the absence of extenuating circumstances.

Furthermore, again, can you provide your source that this has cost us ""millions"" of pounds, and that the majority of Scots were against the course to begin with?",0,1392231972,null,0,false,0,cfdn0ea,t3_1xlrbi,t1_cfdn0ea,t1_cfdmoc4,null,1432368019,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

What do you think is meant by a one off exactly?

The flood defences in New Orleans are adequate for normal conditions. It took a monumental weather event to break them. Something that couldn't be predicted. That is why I called it a one off.

Here is where Britain diverges. This weather is expected to be common in the coming decades. The flood defences are not adequate for normal operating behaviour. So the question then becomes which path do you take? Do you sink ever more money into defences or favour a policy that mandates some migration (taking the principle that yes some flood defences in some places will obviously be improved).

Yes we could spend countless billions on a new array of flood defences. My point is more that we should give some consideration to whether people should actually move.

true,mostly_posts_drunk,cnty-england,comfortably numb,"&gt; I think many people believe that because if you use it on a regular basis your tolerance grows quite quickly. So if you were the type of person who could smoke a king sized joint before going to work, then you eventually stop smoking for years, the next time you try to smoke an entire joint to yourself it's going to mess you up. Obviously you don't want to think of yourself as a lightweight because you have fond memories of smoking an ounce a week to yourself, so the only other answer is that the drug is simply much stronger than it used to be.

Thats probably part of it.

The other part is that an awful lot of what people were smoking back in the 60's and up to the 80's was just... *Crap*. The media thinks that modern weed is ""*genetically engineered hydroponic superskunk*"" or whatever, the truth is that there's been weed as good as 'modern' weed around nearly forever, but the chances are that if your parents smoked then half of what they were smoking were leaves and twigs, combined with it being grown by people with no real understanding of what they're doing (very few books and no internet to guide you), bad curing (drying) methods, which lead to very different THC/CBN ratios compared to most weed today, which changes the feel of the high.

Which is not to say that quality weed didn't exist back then, just that if you ever found it on these shores you were either lucky, a rockstar, or a connoisseur.

Look at any movie from the 60's or 70's where people are rolling, it's just huge skins full of green, with little or no tobacco, if you tried doing that with quality product today you'd be a vegetable within a few tokes...

Although I love the idea of an MP in their 50's trying to relive their youth by rolling a 'triple skinner' out of pure modern quality green and going absolutely out of their minds for 4 hours... that probably explains much of our drug policy.

true,ILOVEGLADOS,null,null,"Everton can't quite grasp the concept of 'foreign' fans. Almost every Evertonian I meet has to make a point about Norwegian fans (the stereotype that seems to have stuck) but my reply to that is; ""Why does it matter where they're from? They're pumping money into the club aren't they?"" If these fans are able to dump a good chunk of money on the club, who are we to tell them to fuck off? Everton have this 'Peoples Club' mentality ever since Moyes coined the phrase and they have absolutely lapped it up since and have kinda rejected anything even remotely different since. Its a case of 'look at us, we have less fans but they're more local and therefore more passionate' idea than 'you might have more fans but they're all armchair fans who probably couldn't even point to Liverpool on a map'. 

I think it also stems from the 'Them vs Us' mentality of the city. Liverpool is a very socialist city and whilst it is very welcoming to foreigners and visitors as a whole, there are certain pockets of people who are very wary of anyone from outside the city. You might have heard the phrase 'wool' or 'woolyback' being said a lot. A wool is basically someone not from Liverpool, sometimes even people in and from Liverpool still get called it because they're from a certain part of the city.

The Glory Hunter is another thing they used to leech onto but ever since 09/10 its mostly gone away, however I can see it making a comeback rather soon given our current league standing- expect the 'Where were you when you were shit?' chants to crop up in some home games in the future.",0,1392233942,null,0,false,0,cfdo09t,t3_1xqa0q,t1_cfdo09t,t3_1xqa0q,null,1432368495,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

He has been a loyal servant to the club and deserves a chance when he comes back. An honestly what options do we have? 

Flanagan - Solid defender but doesn't offer nearly as much going forward as Johnson at his peak. Very hard-worker and gives his all which is the most important thing, but he doesn't have the technical ability of Johnson. 

Kelly - I don't really rate him. He has yet to convince me for a prolonged period, that is if he can stay injury free for more than 3 games. 

I would take Johnson over Kelly any day, I don't really see why Kelly deserves to start over a proven full-back who has performed well for the club both in Europe and in the League.

The United Kingdom is the gatekeeper to Europe and European trade for Scotland,  that is a strong position that puts it on a much greater advantage to Scotland. and without any consideration for scotland (why should we) any UK political goals or strategy is determined by this relationship.

Your request for examples is simple foolish, has it never occurred to you that in days of the past there would be no need, as warfare is cheaper and more instant. but in todays climate that is no longer acceptable

likewise if economic tactics did occur they would have been swallowed up by the host nation and formed a long union that would exist today

hence your insistent on ""give me an example"" is so foolish.

If you actually objectively look at the resources and infrastructure of the UK and scotland they are significantly different orders of magnitude. and composition also.

Scottish  Independence is absolute madness, you are effectively losing your voice on the world stage to become an irrelevance, and losing all the security simply to be able to change a bit legislation.

I guarantee that Scotland will not have major reforms to be indistinguishable from the UK in terms of culture or legislation. as its the ""Norm""

true,Nemokles,null,null,"Well, there are multiple ways to view this. I don't really take a stand in this discussion, I just support the team I love and let others discuss whether I'm a proper fan or not. See, I am on of those non-scouse people you speak of.

Anyways, first off one could ask, what is really the *point* of supporting a football club? I would divide it into five general reasons: *locality*, *family*, *skill*, *glory* and what I will call *first come, first take* (or LFSGF). Really, the first two and the second and third could probably be combined, but I want to sepparate them to highlight some subtle differences that I think are important to a lot of people.

---

**Locality**: Is the club situated close to you? If you feel connected to your community you will automatically have some ties to the club. You are supporting ""the local lads"" and that idea seems very natural to most people. The question then remains, if the club is not local to you, why would you support it in the first place? As in all classic us-them-divides the answer comes with the question; they have no good/proper reason to support the club and must therefore be glory hunters. Is this true? You decide.

An easy counter-argument to this reasoning is that in modern football very few players are really ""local lads"" anyways. How much more local is Everton as a team really? No, there are probably a lot of teams close by that feature a lot more local players and the Everton fans didn't choose to support any of those, did they? Pehaps there is a lacking element of both *skill* and *glory* there? Isn't playing in the Premier League a form of glory in itself? Something to think about for those that art so holier than thou.

---

**Family**: Family doesn't mean just family but really, anyone who is close to you or who is able to affect your allegiance through some means. It could be peer pressure from an entire city. Seems to me like most people in Liverpool support either Liverpool or Everton. Did they all just spontaneously decide to do so? I think not.

For me a family member introduced me to Liverpool and that was pretty much that. After a while my love for the club grew larger than the association with my dearest cousin and I can honstely say that I at least *feel* like a proper fan today, this matchday.

A lot of people from Liverpool can probably proudly say that their entire family are fans, but did they ever think that so might many out-of-towners as well?

---

**Skill**: Aren't we all just suckers for those Suárez nutmegs? Those Gerrard tackles and long balls? Coutinho's through balls? Kuyt's (and now Henderson's) work rate? A well timed tackle? Seems like a good reason for support to me.

Still, one could argue that skill and glory are just two sides of the same coin, you support whoever you think is best and that is a flimsy sort of support. Loyalty is held high in football fandom and is really what makes it unique and special in our way. 

Our cultural norms for supportership are strikingly similar to that we have to relationships and marriage. You are supposed to find one and stay together forever, even though it might be hard at times. In some ways our expectations of fans are even greater, though. No one will blame someone suffering from spousal abuse from seeking a divorce, yet what would we say of an old Leeds supporter that has since changed flags?

Irrationality is what makes love special and this uncompromising, insane irrationality is perhaps the key to what makes being a fan special. 

But still, though, did you see that nutmeg?

---

**Glory**: We all enjoy glory; to win and conquer. Everyone want to be on the side of the victor, but there is perhaps an important distinction between those who want *their side to win* rather than those who just want to *support the sides that wins*. So you have a club with a history of winning with a lot of clubs that are not local. Remember the question from before? 

Given the glory that Liverpool has had in the past (and more recent past), it's quite natural that some questions of glory hunting from fans are raised. 

What do we think of the very recent Chelsea and Manchester City fans? I know I can become quite judgemental rather quickly whenever I meet a Chelsea fan which had his awakening after Abramovich took over. I didn't seem to meet so many of them before that time.

---

**First come, first take**: Many of us will always have a special place in our heart for that first team that awed us, perhaps just by being the first team we saw win a match or play in a way we liked. The emphasis on loyalty amongst fans only makes this will to stick with the first stronger.

For me the first wasn't Liverpool, it was a Norwegian club called Rosenborg which through the nineties had a dominance in Norwegian football that I have never heard of before or since. They were not local to me, but there was a lot of local players in the team, something which made their accomplishments all the more impressive. One of those players will probably be familiar to you, Vegard Heggem. He did a lot to smooth my transition from Rosenborg-curious into a Liverpool fan. See, as much as Rosenborg will always hold a special place in my heart, like that first girlfriend, it was never really love until I saw those boys in red.

I think his greatest asset is getting around defenders and creating space. He is great and putting the ball away from a defender. 

Also, you really can't say because of this last 4 games he is overrated. Not. At. All. If you are getting call-ups for Brazil and featuring in their starting XI more times than not you have great ability. 

All in all, I disagree with you wholeheartedly. He is still super young and learning his craft. Not that he has to prove anything to us, he is great. 

Also, imagine if we had a competent striker who could finish a fucking chance?! Oscar's stats would be great. Eto'o had so many chances to rip a shot in the box but he kept taking extra touches and it was infuriating.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"&gt; oh dear. business bears risk and cost in a free market. Natural disaster victims don't

This isn't true. Natural disasters can happen anywhere, but they are more likely to happen in certain areas. If you choose to live in an area with more natural disasters (San Francisco for instance, being on a tectonic fault line) you are bearing the risk and at least some of the cost – in terms of damaged property, risk to health, inconvenience. 

Arguably in a free society people should be able to decide whether or not they want to take on the inherent risks associated with living in certain places. The question is who is going to pay to compensate for those risks, either in the form of insurance, relief aid or engineering to offset the danger. If the government pays for relief or defences they are arguably subsidising the costs inherent in living with those areas. Whether that is worthwhile or not depends on your point of view and the situation in question.

true,Galerath,null,null,"&gt;Yes thank you i know about Comparative advantage, however you seem to not understand that in the context of Scotland and the United Kingdom wrt to the rest of the world this is not an advantage over managing an environment where one controls the market.

&gt;The United Kingdom is the gatekeeper to Europe and European trade for Scotland, that is a strong position that puts it on a much greater advantage to Scotland. and without any consideration for scotland (why should we) any UK political goals or strategy is determined by this relationship.

So if you do understand Macroeconomics, why would a country try to cause a financial crisis in a major trading partner when doing so would destroy their own economy too? Financial crisis in Scotland would hammer the markets in London and the cross border trade, and then the EU would have to bail Scotland out which the UK would have to pay for. Your version of events simply does not make sense.

Additionally Scotland is not exactly cut off. Those deep water ports I mentioned. Those are quite handy for international trade.

Also to do so would be to break EU Free Trade Agreements. Scotland will get into the EU either immediately (since there's no legal framework for stripping EU citizens of their status) or very quickly after because it's simply a pragmatic consideration. You're working in some sort of bizzaro world where all existing treaties are nullified so England can go on a 19th century style power trip.

&gt;Your request for examples is simple foolish, has it never occurred to you that in days of the past there would be no need, as warfare is cheaper and more instant. but in todays climate that is no longer acceptable

So in today's climate it's totally normal for large countries to destroy small ones financially and annex them. That claim needs examples. You appear to have none. 

&gt;likewise if economic tactics did occur they would have been swallowed up by the host nation and formed a long union that would exist today

&gt;hence your insistent on ""give me an example"" is so foolish.

Yet we haven't seen anything like this. Europe is perhaps the most peaceful region in the world and has a great deal of economic incentives to stay that way, so you're working from a scenario that nobody accepts as likely.

&gt;hence your insistent on ""give me an example"" is so foolish.

Yes, so foolish of me to ask you to justify yourself when you clearly can't.

&gt;If you actually objectively look at the resources and infrastructure of the UK and scotland they are significantly different orders of magnitude. and composition also.

No they aren't significantly different orders of magnitude, in terms of population size, they're roughly the same as the sources I gave you make clear. I.e. Scotland contributes about [9.9%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Scotland#Relationship_with_the_United_Kingdom) of the UK's tax receipts with only [8.4%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography_of_the_United_Kingdom) of the population. 

&gt;Scottish Independence is absolute madness, you are effectively losing your voice on the world stage to become an irrelevance, and losing all the security simply to be able to change a bit legislation.

Ah yes, that place on the world stage so coveted by our government, yet we're soundly ignored by Russia, China and the US. The UK is already an irrelevance. Little more than military reserves for the USA.

We don't *want* to go about invading foreign countries, we don't *want* to be an aircraft carrier/listening station for the USA. We want closer ties with Europe and Nordic countries. We aren't giving up these wonderful things, we're rejecting these horrific, Imperialist notions of lost glory and grandeur. We don't want to live in the past of the long dead British Empire, we want to live in the future of a peaceful, integrated Europe. 

&gt;Scotland is effectively a stroppy teenager moving out, over some minor cosmetic and trivial indifference, completely unaware of just how dependant and protected it has been.

No, we want to move out to establish our own nation on more left wing ideology. We see the neoliberal fever that has overtaken Westminster. Our choices at the polls are Right Wing and More Right Wing, and we want no part of it. We feel under-represented, under developed and poorly treated and we think we can do better by ourselves.

And here you are, claiming you know so much better than the people of Scotland and the Scottish government. Yet repeatedly you cite no sources and provide no argument except insults. If we're stropey teenagers, you're the abusive, ignorant parent who has given us no support and no encouragement. Convinced we're a failure and unwilling to believe otherwise.

My experience. Was. Shit. Absolutely. Fucking. Shit.

They promised responsiveness all over their website! And their sales people *are* responsive - which is why I chose them. But they assign you a qualified conveyancer who *never* is there when you call, doesn't respond to e-mails for weeks at a time.

The only way I could ever get through was to call an 0845 number.

The problem is these online websites look slick. But once they have your business and fees (oh, and after a few weeks they'll call you last thing on a Friday with demands for additional fees for this or that) they won't give a flying shit.

In the end I had to jump in my car and drive for 2 hours to Dorset to sign some papers or else nothing would have got done for several more weeks. Two hours there, two hours back.

PAY AN EXTRA HALF GRAND AND GET A LOCAL LAWYER. Trust me - trying to contact someone by phone/e-mail that couldn't give a shit is nerve racking. If you have a local lawyer at least it is easy for you to go enquire where things are at.

---

I swear to God I will *never*, *ever* use an online conveyancer ever again. (Was my first home purchase). I thought getting the mortgage approved was painful. Turned out that was the *easy* bit.

In the end I got my house but the service was less than ""professional"" - it was downright disrespectful in all honesty. They did all the required searches but they gave poor to no advice. And tried to pull a ""chancel liability"" con on me.

Lights keep flickering ominously but power seems to be holding on for now. All trains are cancelled in Cumbria and most of Lancashire as far as I hear (Liverpool included). Trees down across a few of the A-Roads (some have been cleared already), the M6 is reportedly closed or not moving. 

In Barrow there have been a few roof tiles going - a house lost most of its siding too. A few businesses opted to shut early to allow workers to get home. At the BAE shipyard employees were advised not to travel between *buildings* during the day as it was unsafe. 

There's been some ground water collecting in a few isolated places including roads.

So they sent through the sanction request, the job centre sent me a letter so I can contest it, which I did. The sanction went through and I ended up having to write to the complaints department, who then looked into the case, found that there was a mess up with the addresses and lifted my sanction (so the addresses problem has been fixed as of the 7th of this month).

Only on the 8th, I received another sanction letter about a missed appointment on the 4th Feb, for the same reasons.

Her debut single, which was an emotional ballad called ""[Jar of Hearts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jar_of_Hearts),"" charted after it was featured on the [Fox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company) television show So You Think You Can Dance in 2010. The single went on to sell over 3 million copies in the United States and was a hit around the world. In the UK, it reached number three on the charts and spent over 3 months in the UK Top 40. A few months later, Perri released her first [extended play](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play), The Ocean Way Sessions.

1) Bentelab has been poor. His passing has been loose and his dribbling has resulted in giving the ball away. Would like to see Townsend on for him and Dembele moved central.

2) Paulinho hasn't been bad, but he hasn't been good. Would give him some time in the 2nd half, and if he doesn't do anything better, sub Eriksen on.

3) Ref has been poor, IMO. Bad calls both ways. Thought Lennon got to the ball first and could've gotten a pen, but my stream also looks like a 1990's unpaid for porn channel.

We're lucky we're playing Newcastle tonight... there are lots of teams that would have torn us a new arsehole already tonight.  We need to break up play - or at least find a way of slowing it - in the line between our midfield and defence.

And I disagree about Bentaleb/Paulinho.  I actually think Paulinho's been guilty of losing the ball under far less pressure, breaking down so many of our attacks.  Bentaleb I thought has looked pretty damn good... one of his better shifts for us.

On the one hand, if you're going to have a 3 tier system based on risk, then ketamine would seem to fit in the middle - not hugely harmful once in a while but taken every day it will wreck your bladder. The C classification always looks a bit odd and out of place.

On the other hand the 3 tier system is already messed up beyond repair. Magic mushrooms, with a negligible toxicity level are fairly harmless when taken in a safe environment (which they usually are)  yet are a class A. Something like rohypnol, with a moderate toxicity and higher potential for abuse is a class c. There are examples of this kind of thing throughout the misuse of drugs act. Then we have the addition of 'legal highs' which render the whole system pointless anyway.

true,jrik23,null,null,"If you had leased a 2011 Honda Civic EX-L with $1000 down and $450 a month for 3 years (no more than 12k miles each year, these values are using current leasing terms for 2014 as 2011 terms are unknown).  The purchase price of the car was $22,000.  Assuming 60% residual, the value of the car will be $13,300.  So you paid $17,200 over three years and when your lease is over and you have the option to buy your car they will sell it to you at the current market rate of $13,300 assuming you don't have cash you finance the amount over 3 years at a low interest of 2.99% APR (current market rate).   So total paid (with 7.5% tax) is $32,165.90.  If you had just decided to purchase the car out right at 2.99 % for 6 years (72 months) you would have paid $359.22 a month for a total of $25,863.80 over the life of the loan, a difference of $6,302.08.  This is for just demonstration purposes to show what the difference is between leasing and purchasing a car when you intend to own the car completely.   
Let us say that you intend to trade in your car after 3 years towards the purchase of a new car, if you leased the car you would have paid $17,200 for a leased car that you can walk away from.  If you had purchased the car you would owe $10,549.87 after 3 years of making payments.  Your trade in value would be $13,300, so after the loan is paid off you would have $2,750 that would go towards the purchase of your new car.  
As a recap:  
If you lease the car you will have paid $10,165 over asking price.  
If you purchased the car you would have paid $3,863.84 over asking price. 
If you wanted a new car after three years:
If you leased the car you will have paid $17,200 after 36 months
If you purchased your car and traded it in after 36 months of a 72 month finance plan you will have paid $12,931.90 and owed $10,549.87.  You would have $2,750 to put towards the purchase towards a new car.
This example only shows the typical lease agreement with 60% residual value and doesn't take into account agreements such as set price buyout after lease agreements end.  Set price Buyout is rare and most companies don't offer it and would have to be negotiated (Manufacturers set residual price).  Set price Buyout can also screw you over if the value of the car is lower than the set price.  
Using the example with the terms of a 2014 Jetta S lease for 36 months @ $159/month and $2,349 due at signing results in paying $8,073 after 36 months and then purchasing the car for $9,400 (trade in value of 2011 VW Jetta) total paid would be $17,912.50.  If you were to finance the car for 72 months at 2.99% then you would have paid $18,476.60.  So you would have saved $564.12 over a 6 year period if you leased the car rather than purchasing it.  Do you think that this savings is worth it?

It will also be nice when he gets to finally take a break from playing football. He's played almost non stop since 2011. He's played 194 matches for club and country in that time. 

Watch him play for Brazil and tell me he doesn't have a knack for goal or eye for a pass. Only two players have scored a hat trick in a World Cup Final (all ages), the infamous Geoff Hurst in the '66 World Cup final for England and Oscar in the U-20 World Cup in 2011. Remember the name Ganso? Supposed to be the next great Brazilian attacking midfielder. Yeah, when Oscar was given the chance (due to a Ganso injury) he completely displaced him from the first XI. Now he's one of the first names on the team sheet. Last year he had a string of 5 or 6 matches in a row where he was Man of the Match for Brazil.

Not making excuses but I think Oscar is still learning to deal with the Premier League. Notice how he performed better last year in the Champions League and Europa League? That style of play is much more suited for him. Playing against a team that completely parks the bus is something he hadn't really played against until he moved to England.

The attacks are 2fold (or 1 fold depending upon an Exchanges automatic withdrawal system). Depending on a systems automatic state it can be dependent upon human error also (as Gox badly suffered from).

We did not need a patch as our system was created with an attack vector of this kind in mind.

Our withdrawal system is automatic.

Our withdrawal system checks more than the transaction ID.

We understand the reasons very well (well, to be honest, our lead developer understands it far better than myself).

If there are other Exchange owners/developers out there who wish to discuss the issues, they are welcome to contact us via support@ibwt.co.uk

Edit: I will also be discussing the issue of MtGox and the DDOS attacks in more detail at the next Plymouth Bitcoin Meetup, as unfortunately posting in a public forum (such as reddit) is generally not a good idea.

2nd Edit: There's numerous reasons why other Exchanges could be affected. And please note, some Exchanges might just be having downtime to double check their own software and they might be perfectly fine. It is good business practice that if you're unsure you turn stuff off until you can be 100% sure. 

If an Exchange (or marketplace) has basically copy/pasted from github some other/older Exchanges code, then they've probably hit trouble, or they've just coded slightly wrong, or they are just playing it safe (very wise), but I can't rightly say anything for certain with regards to other Exchanges/marketplaces (so please take this paragraph with a pinch of salt).

true,Kesuke,null,null,"I'm with the above poster on this - the position of an independent Scottish government (presumably SNP led) would actually be deceptively weak. As I see it they only really have three areas they can use as significant negotation leverage;

* **Oil** - It means a lot in Scotland for many reasons, partly economic but also cultural. The huge oil industry is one of the few industrial success stories in this part of the world and one of the only such stories in Scotland. My point is - it means more to Scots both economically and culturally than it does to the rest of the British. It makes up a relatively small part of GDP as a whole for the nation and the UK *could* live without it.
* **Trident** - Ultimately pressure from the US and NATO is going to make forcing an immediate relocation of Trident politically difficult, since doing so would be tantamount to forcing the UK to unilaterally disarm as moving it will take a decade or two and involve a lot of decommissioning work. The bottom line is, even with the best will in the world shifting trident isn't going to be easy for either Westminster or Holyrood. 
* **Undermining the UK** - Actually potentially the biggest point of leverage. What I mean by this is the compliance of the Scots in not simply trying to undermine the UK as a bargaining tool to extract financial rewards... for example by making fast and loose threats about the national debt simply to try and pressure the UK into a settlement.

Now, on the other hand the UK has a lot of areas where it can both apply pressure on the Scots and offer compromises in exchange for policies beneficial to the UK. Such areas include currency issues, EU membership, access to the UKs enormous overseas diplomatic appartus at least while the Scottish form some sort of diplomatic organization. Defense co-operation, access to UK government data (including surprisingly simple but important things like tax records) 

**Tl;dr:** Suprise suprise, but a country 10 times larger than Scotland that was always historically been economically dominant has a lot more leverage than the SNP give credit. And Westminster are smarter than to go around bragging about it just yet as that will only fuel the independence movement.

&gt;So Russell Brand is also pushing this heavily... Please share the link, and let's try and make a difference


As a former drug addict I never miss an opportunity to harp on about drugs. Below this email are some links to articles I've written on my own addiction, the death of Amy Winehouse and lately Philip Seymour Hoffman. 

I assume you’ve read all three and are well acquainted with my tragic condition and brave graciousness in the face of adversity. Thank God. We can now focus on what's important. Right.

My belief is that addiction is a disease and making it illegal to have a disease makes a bad situation worse. We all know someone affected by addiction to drink or drugs, even if they're just some discarded human casualty we step over on the street. 

The truth is this is a situation that we can improve by working together. Here are some facts:

Almost 2,000 young people die in the UK each year from taking illegal drugs of uncertain potency, that they can only get hold of on the illegal market. Leading police, doctors, and politicians agree prohibition has completely failed to curb addiction and instead is costing the UK £3 billion a year. 

Over 100,000 Britons are arrested every year for using drugs – and of course it is the poor and minority users who are targeted, not the rich and powerful.

You may as well know that I believe contemporary democracy to be a meaningless charade designed to placate and distract - but I'm willing to be proved wrong. There’s a chance to start the debate, begin a sane and effective policy and save lives: Nick Clegg says he wants reform (at the moment- so act quick before he changes his mind) and the anomalously trustworthy MP Caroline Lucas has started a campaign to call for a full review of UK drugs policy. But we only have days to get 100,000 of us to join her so the government will be forced to debate it in Parliament. It will take 90-100 seconds (depending on typing skills). Please sign this thing:

http://www.avaaz.org/en/uk_epetition/?bCfeGeb&amp;v=35792

Other countries have tried sensible policies based on something called evidence-- Portugal eliminated criminal penalties for drug users more than a decade ago. Since then, the number of teenagers who take illegal drugs has gone down, the number of addicts who undergo rehab up, and there’s been a big drop in drug users who become infected with HIV. Switzerland, too, has seen crime plummet and drug-related deaths fall since bringing in more progressive and tolerant drug laws.

The e-petition is easy: if 100k of us sign up, the drugs policy will be debated in Parliament. This in turn will help get the government to change the failing drug laws and save lives.

I've signed it and I hate signing things, it reminds me of school and I feel like participating makes me a tedious square and no better than them slimey battery-pod people from the Matrix (Neo before rescue) however I have done it as this is a war I know we can win. Prohibition is an idea that is dying, let's kill it now with unified defiance so we lose as few people to drugs and their related problems as possible. Cheers.

http://www.avaaz.org/en/uk_epetition/?bCfeGeb&amp;v=35792

For fuck's sake sign it, I'm boring myself.

A random paper I found online gives an average kick force for some Taekwon-Do practitioners of ~300N, so significantly less than the total force exerted by the water.  As for pressure, how big an area do you hit when you kick something? 10cm by 10cm if you just hit with the ball of your foot?

www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/sn04033.pdf

Also Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland receive more spending per head than London.

I imagine London's non-investment spending is similar to that of nearby regions, but things like public transport attracts lots of investment because without them London would cease to function.

I also think the amount of investment in London will appear to be greater simply due to the size of each project being more impressive and news friendly. 

The elected Mayor of London has a city 16 times the size as the elected Mayor of Bristol. If the Mayor of Bristol wants to plant 1,000 trees, the Mayor of London can plant 16,000. Which will make the national news?

Im glad you are not running any country as you seem to be confused how relying on ""Give me one example of a country that has done x"" when X is dependant on a situation specific geopolitical relationship,  and so is an entirely redundant (not to mention stupid) nonsense argument..

It is actually quite disturbing that you don't know or seem to wonder why countries spend all this money and time forming alliances and relationships with other countries and extend and expand their prowess and ""power"" on the world stage.

Once scotland hits an international issue e.g fishing quotas etc, it will learn as you will, exactly why its so important to have powerful friends and be seen as major player.

You also seem to think the EU is some magic club that guarantees harmony and non competing nations,

The last thing I'd want you to do is go underground with a little private clique of like-minded people who think exactly the same as you do, and spend all their free time bouncing self-reinforcing ideas off of each other until someone decides to act on one of those ideas, *perhaps* because there was no other outlet or counter-argument, which was perhaps because of a lack of free-speech due to laws that restrict ideas.

Free speech is not an argument for being allowed to do such things as incite murder, it's an argument for a few being allowed to share dangerous ideas, and for the many to listen and understand that some people have them.

true,BrambleBees,wales-denbighshire,Denbighshire,"As far as Universal Jobmatch goes, we've basically covered the rights of users.  All they are currently required to do is have an account and use it.  What they use it for and how often is between the individual and their advisor; jobseekers here will probably know that their jobseeker's agreement specifies a number of steps they need to take each fortnight and use of Universal Jobmatch is part of how that number can be reached.  If you don't think it's any good (which it isn't), all you have to do is log in, do a quick search, note it down and do the rest of your job seeking elsewhere.  Ideally of course you shouldn't have to do even that, but sanctions given on the basis that UJ is not being used are easily avoidable.

I think it's important to realize that the advisor's aren't all diabolical masterminds.  If you reach the target number (not difficult, since you can count pretty much anything) they have no cause to make your life difficult.  That said, some are harsher than others, and some give higher targets than others.  I've seen people with targets ranging from ~10 to 60+, and I'm sure there are some that go considerably higher.

Another important thing to keep in mind is that some of the people complaining really aren't trying at all.  The greater part of the work I'm doing is helping people create and use UJ accounts, but many of them clearly have no intention of using it and will forget everything I've said as soon as they leave the building.  This is even more apparent when I see them again two weeks later and they have forgotten or lost all of the information I gave them, even though I typically give them two paper copies and strongly advise them to take a photograph of the information using their phone (which most are happy to do, but still 'lose' it).  I know it's very unpopular to view poor people as scroungers, lazy, etc. (rightly so), but the uncomfortable truth is that I see a lot of people just like that.  They're not the majority by a long way, but there are plenty of them, and once they realize I'm just a volunteer they aren't shy about telling me so.

This post probably isn't what a lot of people want to see, but it is what I've observed.  UJ is crap, no question, but anyone who gets sanctioned for not using it has just shot themselves in the foot.  It definitely sucks that we're being forced to use a broken system, but I wouldn't expect it to last much longer.  At this rate I find it hard to believe Monster can hold on to the contract for any great length of time, since they're doing such an obviously shitty job.

I butted into a staff meeting the other day (which I wasn't really supposed to be at) to make sure that **ALL** of the advisors in my building are now well aware of how many fake jobs are on UJ and the fact that is has plenty of other problems as well.  A few days earlier I had been tasked with teaching a new manager how to use UJ (ironic much?), and the meeting was her official introduction to the rest of the staff.  In my area the number of fakes is WAY higher than the one third mentioned in this article.

**TL;DR:** This post was very rambly.  Apologies.  Bottom line is that even though UJ is crap, sanctions borne of it are easy to avoid.

true,borg88,eng-buckinhamshire,Buckinghamshire,"&gt; I heard that it was because the people who could only afford 3rd party (ie young drivers) opted for that, crashed a lot, and now the insurers assume that anyone going for 3rd party only is some sort of hoodlum.

They already know how old you are, and they already hammer everyone if they are young.

Presumably young drivers who take out third party only are statistically more likely to have make a claim than young drivers who take fire and theft too. We can speculate as to *why* that might be, but the insurance companies just look at the stats.

It isn't true across the board - as an older driver with a good claims record and a very low value car, it is very slightly cheaper for me to take 3rd party *without* fire and theft. I say cheaper - it saves me about £2.50 a year. But the car is almost worthless so they wouldn't pay out anyway.

&gt; I've never understood the fire clause

Never thought about it before, it is a little odd. I guess it is something that *can* happen to a car which isn't either a collision or theft.

Chadli did have a great goal today, but his lack of pace on worries me.  He had a great shot today.  However, the opportunity wouldn't have presented itself without overly agressive defense by Newcastle and a great backheal pass by Bentaleb.

1.) Although there are 9 players on the field at a time (plus a goalie), you're only allowed to have 6 players on each side of the field (3 attack and 3 defensemen generally stay on their respective sides of the field with 3 midfielders allowed to roam the whole field). Offside occurs when more than 6 players are on either side of the field, and as such, there are no offside traps, etc.

2.) The defensemen have longer sticks and checking is legal, which means you can't really hoof the ball forward to the attack and hope for the best.

3.) The layout of the field means that players can legally go behind the net and attacking play can be generated from behind the goal line. Obviously no comparison for that in football. 

4.) Time wasting and prolonged periods of possession is difficult/ impossible as teams are issued warnings for ""stalling"" play. After a warning, a team that continues to stall may lose possession.

All home matches are must win: 19*3 = 57
  
All away games vs last seasons top 12 (excluding our club) are must draw: 12*1 = 12
  
All away games to bottom 7 are must win: 3*7 = 21

So every club starts at 0, and everytime you fulfill the condition above you remain at zero. However say you lose a 1 point game (loss against arsenal away), you become -1. But then next match you beat a club at home, still remain -1 as you have done as expected. Third game you beat Everton at Goodison park, that means +2 as you were expected to draw.
  
The whole idea of this Alternative table is that the real table is unfair as it doesn't weight the different opponents. Like in chess, you have a certain table (forgot the name) that ranks your points won based on the opponents rank.

There are many such tables, some will accept losses (as it's more real life scenario), others will weight teams differently etc. but the idea remains the same: the real table doesn't give a clear picture of the progress. City for example has had home matches against top 7, why should their 6 wins count more than another team that has beaten 3 top 7 teams away and drawn 4. Surely the matches have different difficulty levels and should be weighted so.

Which is why Arsenal drawing United tonight has them -2, they must win all home games to maintain a good title challenge, and draws or losses at home must be compensated by wins away vs big clubs.

There was one game I remember watching Torres score twice in a few minutes. Recalling that, I went with Liverpool especially since the few people I talked to who knew anything about football supported either Madrid or United. I didn't want to support the Yankees of football or the most popular and successful in recent years English club so I went with Liverpool. They were a good team and they had Torres who made me a fan. Sadly, he fucked off to Chelsea half a season later but at least we got someone who looks like he can be twice the player Torres was for us.

1.  News like this tends to get little if any attention outside Scotland.  

2.  A skeptic might note that the *experts* hired by the Scottish government invariably come to the conclusion that an Independent Scotland will be all sorts of sparkly awesome.  On the other hand, the *experts* hired by the government *(at Westminster)* invariably come to the conclusion that an Independent Scotland will be a nightmarish mess, insolvent within three minutes of independence and invaded by Cthuthulu by lunchtime. 

3.  The element you quoted doesn't really say that it would be in the best interests of the residual UK to be in a currency union.  It says that it would be in the best interest of a newly independent Scotland to retain Sterling immediately *(which I don't think too many people would argue with)*  and that it's in the best interest of the residue of the UK to maintain an independent Scotland as a key trading partner *(again not really in dispute)*.  Nowhere in there does it tell us anything about whether the leadership of an independent Scotland would be willing to accept the limits that would come with a currency union or whether the UK would get more out of it than the risk is worth.  *(We'll trade anyway.  It's not like Scottish businesses are going to refuse to trade with the UK.)*

4.  A currency union is probably an impossible sell for a government of the residual UK.  Bearing in mind this is purely my opinion:  Independence for Scotland *may* be a good thing for Scotland.  Independence for Scotland will almost certainly be bad for the rest of the UK on several levels.  The rest of the UK is effectively held hostage to the wishes of a minority in this.  For want of a better analogy if Scotland votes for independence it's comparable to your wife unilaterally deciding she wants a divorce.  And while she might be right when she says, *""I want a divorce, but I think we'd be better off if we maintain a joint bank account!""* she'd be foolish to claim surprise when your response is negative and littered with expletives.",0,1392248326,null,0,false,0,cfdvahn,t3_1xp1wp,t1_cfdvahn,t1_cfdi4i6,null,1432371987,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
