true,The3rdWorld,eng-essex,Essex,"&gt;Surely the observance of Passover came after the story?  
  
generally stories are invented to explain existing situations, it's unlikely someone said 'hey, i invented a story let's celebrate it every year and pretend like it's real!' more likely there was a long standing practice, similar to the way we have tree's inside at Christmas which is nothing to do with Christ and everything to do with pagan tree spirits.
  
&gt;Wouldn't there have been a lot more historically?   
  
that's a REALLY interesting and complex question, before Hellenisation of the ancient world there were different expectations on reality and the notion of a single universal truth wasn't really as established as we tend to imagine.  Genesis for example certainly isn't the only story of the 7 day week, even Greeks like Plato wrote Genesis stories along the same lines - these generally weren't supposed to be literal descriptions but metaphorical analysis of things from first principles, it's very hard to say at what point people started to take it literally and at any one point how many people took took it as such.  
  
Certainly if you look at any of the books in the old testament they're written about people who have 'fallen away' or 'lost contact' with the covenant, it doesn't seem there's a single point where someone like Moses or Ezekiel isn't saying 'everyones fucking around worshipping the wrong gods or thinking for themselves, THIS is why we can't have nice things!!!!' likewise there is a constant shifting of moral and sociological understanding, an easy example is in some of the earlier stories having a king is forbidden for God is the king, then they get some kings....  To what extent anyone ever thought these were strict and literal laws rather than moral guidelines and useful stories is anyones guess.

Well private schools are almost always better. By nature of being fee-paying, student:staff ratios are way lower and parents tend to be more invested in their children's education resulting in a generally better attitude to learning. Private school pupils are disproportionately represented at the top universities, even when admissions departments will generally hold them to higher standards than state-educated applicants.

[Public schools](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_school_\(United_Kingdom\)), the elite subset  of private schools, are exceptionally high quality. A student there with even a half-decent work ethic would be practically guaranteed a place at Oxford or Cambridge.

There's not just academic benefits to the public schools, and to a lesser extent all private schools, most people there will be from relatively affluent families. Making friends with rich and successful people can be just as beneficial as the education. Possibly a good example of this is that 4 members of the current cabinet happened to attend Eton, the same school as the Prime Minister.

The IB (assuming you mean the International Baccalaureate) has no particular connection with private schools, it's taught in both state and private schools. As far as I know there are very few/no schools that offer the IB exclusively, they'll generally offer it alongside A Levels. Most people tend to choose A Levels over the IB for various reasons.

I'm not sure what you mean by international schools - do you mean the British School of [City] around the world? Because I've no idea what they're like.

With those expensive and underperforming players our of the lineup, we're rumored to have decent money to spend this summer. Add in future FFP regulations and building the side to be self sufficient with home grown talent is the way of the future. With the strength of our academy we look good here. Not to mention we're the youngest squad on average in the prem, so we should continue to see improvement.Improvement defensively. For all of the howler goals we've allowed this season, let's not forget the two recent 4-1 losses were the first two times we conceded 4. Remember where this club was mid season last year where 4+ seemed a regular occurrence. We are still prone to ridiculous lapses in concentration, but I blame that as much on the youth as the staff.Struggles to score. By the end of the campaign we will have gotten approximately a 1/3 of a season out of Benteke due to injuries; he was a ghost of himself first half dozen games back, then got knocked out for year. Wide again man, I mean Weimann, is more of a speedy winger than actual goal threat to me at this point. Kozak looked decent and notched a goal or two before breaking his leg so jury is out. Gabby has always been an inconsistent scorer. Tonev needs to he told if he shoots from 20+ yards he'll be benched immediately. Helenius no chances. Basically what I'm saying is, for all the talk that we don't need another attacking player, Bacuna is our second leading scorer. We could use a poacher.Table improvement. For all the talk, we've moved up the table and can feel safe (for the most part) with a half dozen games to go. At this point last season we were entering squeaky bum time. The total points doesn't mean shit, where we are in relation to the other teams does, because that will determine how aggressive we play.  All said, it is my belief that PL walked into a dumpster fire and has done a decent job doing what Lerner ask him to do.

Adebayor's falling out with AVB is speculated to have materialized from a moment where, in front of his teammates in the locker room, he told AVB his system did not work...not so much for his teamwork.

Adebayor has been labeled a selfish mercenary by many detractors. Ironically, his playing style is much more oriented towards doing what is best for the team. Especially in his recent form, Ade does not just wait around the box for a cross pass but actually drops deep to contribute to linkup play: I remember in the last match there was a pass in the direction of the rightback, and Ade was on the receiving end.

Adebayor has served under three managers thus far at Spurs, thus there is a proper blueprint to make the most of his talents. Having this precedent will allow LVG to utilize him to his best abilities.

true,Drugba,MN,mongolia,"~~A lot of people here keep saying a draw~~, but I don't think that is correct, mainly because we still have to play Liverpool. In my mind, the most favorable result is a Liverpool win.

Right now, regardless of what else happens, if we win our last 5 games, we will finish at least 1 point above Liverpool. We don't have that same luxury against City.

To make this easy I'm going to just assume that City will win their 2 games in hand. That would make the table look like this with ~~35~~ 33 games played each:

**City:** 76

**Liverpool:** 74

**Chelsea:** 72

If 'Pool and City draw this weekend and we win it will look like this


**City:** 77

**Liverpool:** 75

**Chelsea:** 75

Where as a Liverpool win would look like this


**City:** 76

**Liverpool:** 77

**Chelsea:** 75

In both scenarios, It doesn't matter what Liverpool do, it we match their results and win and Anfeild, we are above them so their points doing really matter. 

The problem is, in the Draw scenario City are ahead of us by two points. That means if City can tie one week where we win and they would still be beating us on goal difference (We aren't going to catch them there). Only a loss for City would put us above them. In the City Lose scenario they are only 1 point above us. If they were to draw a week where we win, we would go above them.

&gt;Savile writes: “‘Ah,’ says I all serious, ‘if she comes in I’ll bring her back tomorrow but I’ll keep her all night first as my reward’.” He then writes that the girl did go into the club and “agreed that I hand her over if she could stay at the dance, [and] come home with me”. He wrote that he did then hand her over to the “lady of the law…[who] was dissuaded from bringing charges against me by her colleagues, for it was well known that were I to go I would probably take half the station with me”.

Possibly the same as Westham with the exception of Agger/Allen coming back into the line up in place of Coutinho and Sakho (if they are fit of course) - I believe given Citys firepower we're going to continue to attack from the get go and try and keep that pressing line as far up the pitch as possible, worked wonders against Arsenal and Spurs hopefully it can do the same against city but we need to keep the pace fast and furious 

* Watch

I'd love to pick somebody else but its going to be the Suarez + Sturridge show, if they both bring it we've got a great chance of winning, if they are being a bit selfish then we could be in trouble as their heroics (aka shooting from ridiculous angles and distances rather than passing) could easily set up the other, looks great when were winning but frustrating when were drawing

* History 

i'd say this is the biggest/most important match up against them we've ever had (at least that I can remember), it's widely believed whoever wins this game stands the better chance of winning the league 

* Prediction

Written in the stars that Suarez will score, I really think it will be 2-0 Liverpool with suarez scoring one and setting up the other - He hasnt scored a freekick in a while so thats due

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"&gt; If it's ridiculous to say DoF doesn't work in England and then 
why do your examples of its success not include English clubs? It has been tried many times and never worked. Once you put a DoF in place it undermines the manager and affects his ability to control the dressing room and do his job effectively. This might not be an issue in other countries but it clearly is in the UK.

Fair enough, the DoF system is relatively new to England, but there is already success with LFC using Ian Ayre as a defacto DoF. City have brought in Begiristain to be their DoF, Avram Grant served as a DoF at Chelsea, United used a hybrid version with David Gill doing the negotiations on transfers and contracts after the scouts and SAF identified the players. 

Not sure how a DoF would undermine the manager as in the locker room as they don't deal with the players on a daily basis. Additionally looking at our squad specifically Lloris, Vertonghen, Ericksen, Lamela, Soldado, Capoue, Sandro (VdV also played for a team with a DoF) all came to the club from teams that had a DoF system in place. Bale and Modric came in under a DoF....i don't see how the players would be affected in the locker room by a DoF, for players outside of England it is not an unusual practice to have a DoF. 

As more an more teams modernize they are looking to the continental model for success and not trying to rely on a manager who has to spend the majority of his time with the team to make decisions on players from around the world. 

The whole idea is that you hire a manager to focus on the performance on the field and take the pressure of identification and recruitment of players off of him.  In a good DoF setup the manager has plenty of say in who and what he wants, the DoF just makes sure that he has options and that the team gets what it needs in the best manner.

 Maybe it hasn't had the success in England that it has elsewhere, but it is a bit newer concept to be implemented in England, to outright say it will never work is completely ignoring the fact that it has literally worked everywhere else.

As for Redknapp, i think what he did with us was fantastic and he deserves a great deal of credit for it.  But we also need to keep perspective of what was going on at the time. 

Did we consistently perform well?....yes

Did we reach the Champions League and play well?....yes

Did Harry get the most out of his players?.....yes

Was Liverpool as good as they had been leading into that time period?.....no

Was City as good as they became shortly after we pipped them for 4th?....no

Was Harry responsible for bringing in all his most important players....no

I'm not taking anything away from Harry's performance, but i am trying to keep in perspective what was going on at the same time because it did effect the final result.  Same thing can be said for AVB racking up the record points total last season and the fact that despite being a trainwreck this season we are still in the mix for top 5/6 teams.

I believe that under Harry we captured lightning in a bottle, everything came together for us...we had the right players, the right manager and the right timeframe to click and really achieve things.  If Harry hadn't fucked off for 3 months assuming that he would be coaching England and squandered a lead we probably would have kept him.

I think Levy has struggled a great deal with his appointments, he has no idea how to choose a manager and as for DoF it looks like he got 1 wrong and 1 where the jury is out.  I am hopeful that we make the right appointment this summer for manager so we can steady the ship.  To me, that choice is LvG who seems the perfect choice to ensure that we are positioned to capture lightning in a bottle more consistently.",0,1397157646,null,0,false,0,cgp6mmg,t3_22on7y,t1_cgp6mmg,t1_cgp2qsp,null,1433297940,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

The clarion call for jobs for the masses is not, as far as I know, for jobs for the highly skilled. Impoverished areas are not coming down with unemployed graduates, but with unemployed young people with little qualifications. 

Building a thousand strong center of technology excellence or whatever other wanky term is used will not give jobs to those who would have worked in factories. The IT Industry here is already cannibalising itself. The wages are going up up up and the people available for the jobs is going down. I've personally been involved in recruitment for what would be termed highly skilled technology jobs for the last few years, and know a fair few in the same sector and the same story all over. Staff getting ""nicked"", people on jobs roundabouts forever moving for the extra few k. 

I'd still like to hear what is wrong with being a ""desk jockey"" as opposed to an auto maker assembly line worker, or a line worker making pork pies or looking after a canning line, or plastering a wall....Should all the jobs be restricted to lovely wee jobs with super prospects and great benefits?

Watch out for: I think the key player this match will be Raheem Sterling. His runs behind the defence will be cruical especially with the pace of Demichelis and the tendancy of their full backs to roam forward. As said Flanno vs Navas will be one of the duels to watch. Flanagan always seems to play the best in the big matches so I can see him having another great match. Navas' pace is a worry however.

History / Memories: Maybe the Capital One semi-final at Anfield 2 years ago. A great match that ended 2-2 after a late Bellamy equalizer (we won the first leg 0-1) and took us to the new Wembley for the first time.

Prediction: I don't think it will be quite a goal fest a lot of people are expecting. It think it will be 2-1 to either team (hopefully Liverpool)

true,[deleted],null,null,"* Potential line up / Tactics

There are lots of issues that BR is going to need to figure out before this game - Will he use Sterling as an impact sub as he has done a few times recently? Do we play 4-3-3 for more attacking power, or 4-4-2 Diamond to try and keep a lot of the ball? Does Agger come back into the side after a week out, or will Sakho keep his place after and impressive performance? For the first time in a long time, despite having a fairly shallow squad, Liverpool have a lot of options. The big choices for Brendan Rodgers are the formation and who starts out of Coutinho, Lucas and Allen in that final midfield position. I would be surprised if Sterling doesn't start. Having not played many full games recently he should be fairly fresh.

My predicted starting line-up:

                     Migs
    Johnson    Skrtel    Sakho    Cafu
                 Gerrard(C)
         Henderson       Coutinho
    Sterling      Suarez     Sturridge

* Watch out for

If he's playing, it will be Aguero's first game back. But make no false assumption that he's going to be rusty. Earlier in the season he came on as a sub after more than a month out and scored with his 2nd touch.

I'm going to pick a not-much-talked-about matchup in Yaya Toure vs Jordan Henderson. In every game Yaya plays, he is on the ball a lot and marauds where he likes. But in every game Henderson plays, he seems to sprint non-stop and put pressure on everyone. It'll be interesting to see if Yaya can be that huge attacking threat if he is harried into making passes whenever he gets on the ball. 

Sturridge against his old club should be good. He tends to up his game for matches such as these.

*  History / Memories

Building on that last point, Sturridge scored a belter against City last season. Hopefully he'll get a few shots on target this game, unlike against the Hammers.

* Prediction

I'm going with 4-2 here. This has all the signs to be a high-scoring classic. I think Sterling and Sturridge will get goals, but who knows what else will happen. ",0,1397159525,null,0,false,0,cgp7kcv,t3_22prlr,t1_cgp7kcv,t3_22prlr,null,1433298448,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

                        Hart

    Zaba        Kompany      Demichelis     Kolarov

             Fernandinho       Yaya

     Nasri              Silva               Milner

                        Dzeko

I reckon Pellegrini will want to play positively, but without tipping over into recklessness.  Milner in for Navas is my concession to this.  Milner  could pop up on either side (I originally had him on the right, but Sterling needs someone to keep an eye on him while Kolarov is supporting the attack), and Silva and Nasri will both roam to wherever they see best fit.  I expect that free roaming pair will force Liverpool to commit an extra man to help Gerrard out and that will (hopefully) give us the upper hand in controlling possession.

Perhaps it's hubris but I'm not too worried about Suarez because I'm kind of hoping he'll be drifting off to the left of the attack where he'll have to find a way past Zaba and Kompany.  If he starts popping up on the right and pinging through balls in between Demichelis and Kolarov towards Sturridge and Sterling, then we have a problem - one probably best addressed by the introduction of Garcia at the expense of one of the attacking midfield trio (Yaya would push up to fill that gap and Bob's your uncle).  I just don't want to start Garcia because, despite his dramatic improvement over last season, he still occasionally confuses ""cutting out the attack"" with ""bundling into whoever has the ball"" and I don't trust him to not get himself sent off against Suarez over the course of a full 90 minutes.

Second half, perhaps around the 60 minute mark is what people should be looking out for.  Aguero is expected to play a part if he's needed, and hopefully he'll back to his unstoppable self.

When I think of matches against Liverpool I always come back us wasting time in order to get ourselves relegated.  Fucking ridiculous.  It's hilarious now, but it wasn't at the time.  Okay it was hilarious at the time, but not for City fans.

I'm not one for predictions, but what have I got to lose:

In my mind that would be a SUPER combo, sterling is on the verge of becoming a killer goal scorer himself and Ibe was not far off where sterling was last season (from what I've seen they both play pretty similar to one another except sterling is flashier and ibe is a tank) Suarez is by far the better all round striker and with his dribbling skills he'd benefit having the ball fed to him in a position where he could supply/roam/receive and Sturridge would benefit from sitting deeper and not having to worry about battling for the ball - only gamble is if Ibe is up for it

tbh I think we will line-up similiar to how we did against Everton and Arsenal at home. Try get an early goal then play on the counter. 

                          Migs

        Johnson    Skrtel    Sakho    Scouse-Cafu

                         Gerrard(C)

                Henderson       Coutinho

            Sterling      Suarez     Sturridge


*Watch out for*


The most interesting battles imho are Sterling V Demichelis, Flanno V Navas (or whoever they put on that side) as well as the midfield battle. I think Yaya, on top of being probably the best box to box midfielder in the world, drifts deep and makes the kind of runs that Stevie is still not particularly adept at dealing with even if he has learned the position well, if you see the space Jonjo Shelvy had against us in the Swansea game with those kind of deep surging runs I hate to think what would happen with a world class player. The Winger/Fullback battles are just the battles of the tricky winger V the limited FB but I think which ever team comes out of that best will benefit greatly.

no memories really, it's only recently enough it's become a really important fixture. lots of 2-2 draws though, in recent years.

It's an incredible lot to ask to replicate any result near that for this game, but when you play like we did then, anything's possible. Allen on for Coutinho, Sakho for Agger. I also think Lucas has earned his spot if he gets one, he changed the West Ham game. That's just me, Brendan's got it all figured out I'm sure.

Watch out for: SAS, of course. Sturridge has hopefully gotten whatever he had last week out of his system, if he gets to a bit more passing in the final third instead of the FIFA-esque volleys he was trying, we've got a powderkeg. Suarez thrives in this environment and he's going to go fucking insane. I just hope we can penetrate their back line. 

History: Not a lot. As others have said, 2012 Carling semi, which was a tight affair, but it has nothing on what this game will be like. Tickets are going for exorbitant prices for a reason. 

Prediction: An early goal. From whom I don't know, but there will be at least one goal in the first 10 minutes. That's all I can say is almost set in stone. Suarez to hopefully score one at some point. I'm not by any means set in stone with the idea of a Liverpool win, but god damn it do I believe we can do it at home in front of the Kop. This is it.

Like the FFP thing, this is one of those subjects that I think I'm ahead of the curve on.  

My certainty in it comes from the understanding of how total squad value effects position, on how spending effects total squad value and on how FFP ties spending to revenue.

I think Liverpool will have a lower squad value at that time than City, Chelsea, Arsenal and United, due to a variety of factors from their accounts and from the FFP regulations, and think because of this they won't be able to bridge the gap.

I think too many Liverpool fans are looking at their overachievement this season without context.  I don't think they have thought about the extra £40m a year or so Arsenal will be getting or that United dropped of the pace badly.

United, Liverpool and Arsenal are still interested in bringing through their own youth players, and that shows a difference in mentality and attitude as compared to City and Chelsea.

true,SaradaV,lfc68,,"* **Line up / Tactics**

Our style of play has been pretty consistent all season, looking to play long balls to our front line if they're in space, keeping it and being patient if they're not, and pressing high to win the ball back. In terms of formation however, we've played all sorts this season, 4-2-3-1, 3-5-2, 3-4-1-2, 4-3-3, 4-4-2 diamond, even a flat 4-4-2 (for all of 45 minutes). For the last couple of months though, it's been either a 4-3-3 or a 4-4-2 diamond. Both formations are relatively similar at the back, with full backs pushing on, 2 centre backs and Gerrard sitting just in front of them controlling things. The advantage of the 4-4-2 diamond is it allows both Suarez and Sturridge to play centrally with either Sterling or Coutinho just behind, but the 4-3-3 is more defensively solid (our CMs don't have to cover the flanks so much) and gives us more natural width. I'd say the 4-3-3 has been favoured at Anfield and the 4-4-2 diamond away from home, so personally I reckon we'll be 4-3-3 for Sunday.

As for line-up, Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Flanagan, Gerrard, Henderson, Sturridge and Suarez will play with certainty. Sakho has only just come back into the side but I personally think he'll keep his place even if Agger is fit for Sunday. Further up the pitch, it's generally been two of Allen, Sterling or Coutinho for the last couple of months, but with Lucas putting in a good performance against West Ham further up the pitch than we normally see him it's become two out of four. I'd be very surprised to see Sterling dropped, and with Allen a potential injury worry and Coutinho looking a bit off the pace against West Ham I think Lucas might play alongside Henderson, especially up against Toure and Fernandinho. 

* **Watch out for**

A lot will depend on how City line up. Given that Silva, Nasri, Aguero, Dzeko and Navas don't come across as especially hard working defensively, I'm half expecting Pellegrini to play Milner, and maybe even Javi Garcia too. It'll be interesting to see whether they try to stick a man on Gerrard, or whether they'll look to drop off a little bit and shut down the space further up field. 

I'm personally looking forward to seeing our forwards up against City's defensive line. Kompany aside, they strike me as mistake prone and I wouldn't be surprised to see them give at least one penalty away. Our forwards have won penalties left, right and centre this season and Zabaleta's lazy leg on Cork last weekend is exactly the kind of mistake our strikers will punish.
 
* **History / Memories**

I can't think of any really big Liverpool - City matches, certainly none as big as this. The three that stand out though for me are:


*Manchester City 2 - 3 Liverpool (2008-09)* - Came from two down and scored an injury time winner the year we came second.


*Liverpool 3-0 Manchester City (2010-11)* - Andy Carroll bagged a brace in what was undoubtedly his finest PL game for the club. Also saw the debut of a certain John Flanagan.


*Liverpool 2-2 Manchester City (2011-12)* - Came from behind twice to beat City on aggregate on our way to winning the League Cup


* **Prediction**

2-0 Liverpool. Based on City's tactics and performance at the Emirates the other week, I think Pellegrini will be quite conservative but I don't think his back-line are strong enough to stop our front three. I don't think Toure and Fernandinho alone can really dominate against our midfield, so Pellegrini will have to blunt his attack a little to compete. Sakho alongside Skrtel has been our strongest centre back pairing this season and so I think we'll be stronger at the back than our recent performances have shown.",0,1397164453,null,0,1397164724,0,cgp9zl5,t3_22prlr,t1_cgp9zl5,t3_22prlr,null,1433299590,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Am I confident that Liverpool can grow their own revenue £75 or £80 million and Arsenal can only grow their's half that amount? Yes, quite. Here are the revenue numbers, in millions of Euros, for the last 6 Deloitte Football Money Leagues:

--------**12/13**-----**11/12**-----**10/11**-----**09/10**-----**08/09**-----**07/08**------

AFC---284-------290--------251--------274-------263-------264-------

CFC---303-------322--------249--------256-------242-------269-------

So, at the moment, €43mil separates Arsenal and Liverpool, which is wholly realistic to be the difference between CL football and EL or no CL and €62mil separates Chelsea from Liverpool. In both cases, they have decreased revenues between the last and the most current seasons, and Liverpool has not, despite having more long term debt than either club.

Given that Liverpool is the only club of the two trending up when it comes to gross revenue, could be even with Arsenal and only €20mil or so behind Chelsea next year solely with the addition of CL football and the fact that our commercial team [still out-earned both clubs'](http://i.imgur.com/8u5kyyM.jpg) even without said CL football, I think it's very possible that Liverpool could end up even or above Chelsea next year in revenue. Now, Chelsea's spending power will always be greater than ours, as their owner is willing to invest and willing to post losses even with FFP. But solely from revenue, I have no worry about having a good shot at staying in the top 4 by the end of next season.

The problem though is that you're only looking at this from a Liverpool context.  Arsenal have just signed massive increases on their biggest value commercial deals.  Chelsea have done the same recently.  Their revenue right now is not going to be the same as that.

The problem with your logic is that you're presuming your rivals have or will stand still whilst Liverpool increase and this isn't true.

But Chelsea and Arsenal are not very far off and we are already out-earning them commercially. The difference between us and Arsenal at the moment is CL football and their match day revenues. We are planning on redeveloping Anfield to get close to their matchday revenues (though likely not as much with their large stadium and exorbitant ticket prices) and will have CL football next year. I think we'll be close to even when the 13-14 numbers come out.  Chelsea is a bit harder, but, I think, we have a much higher revenue ceiling than they due to our global appeal and historically large fan base. The difference between Arsenal and Chelsea is some 10-odd million GBP. We can hope our commercial team can increase their revenue by this amount above what Chelsea can earn, I think.

City will take some catching, as Mansour has excellent business contacts with a level of familiarity that nearly no one else in the world has, and is able to get deals done for amounts that do not make as much sense as the deals of other clubs.

About the selly oak thing, I wouldn't be worried, it might be a lot different to where you are though.

 Obviously students all have laptops and nice phones etc. and most are new to living alone, so people do target the area  but the main reason students get robbed is because they leave doors unlocked and valuables out. Just be aware of what's going on around you, and be vigilant. I don't wanna scare you but there are scumbags wherever you go in life, you just have to be aware of that to avoid them.

I agree on Vlad, I thought he was super solid for the whole of the rest of the game, but you can't make a mistake like that at this level and so deserves the rating he got.

I think you've got to say that Eriksen out on the left is just good management from Sherwood. Compare this game against incredibly fragile opposition, to our game under AVB vs Sunderland (and Fulham) and the move to Eriksen out left has given him space to be more useful on the counter and has given us the ability to get some (better than decent) crosses into the box and we're able to actually get past these weak sides easier as a result.

true,the_weeknd,null,null,"* Tactics

I'm expecting to see Sakho start because there's been little word so far on Agger who took a knock before the West Ham game. I wouldn't be surprised to see Lucas back in either to try and combat Yaya/Fernandinho, so a 4-3-3 is most likely imo - with Sterling coming on if thing's aren't going right after HT.

* Watch 

I expect this to be RedCafu's first big test, and I'm sure they'll target him because he'll need support from the LCB (Sakho/Agger) which might create more space at the back for Dzeko/Negredo to run into, although I'd argue City are heavily reliant on their height and often look to cross so maybe if Skrtel and Sakho have a good game we can keep City at bay.

* History

The City games of previous have always been fairly tight affairs, 5 draws at Anfield in the last 6 meetings, the Capital One Cup semi-finals come to mind as being the most recent victory over City, we went on to win that in what would have been a pretty abysmal season otherwise, whilst City in the end went on to win the League. Mistakes and unfortunate decisions have cost us in even more recent times but hopefully that won't be the case come Sunday.

* Prediction 

This is one of, if not the biggest games Anfield has seen in over 20 years, touts are asking for £5,000 for a ticket, it's the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster. All of these factors tell me one thing and that's a Liverpool victory, another Stevie G penalty will open the scoring and the SaS will link up to provide us with another two and a late consolation from Yaya won't be enough! 3-1 Liverpool.

    Navas  Silva   Nasri
         
         Aguero(or Dzeko)

Pellegrini does not go into games looking for a draw, so I doubt he will approach this game in a defensive manner. 

Aguero will be a really big boost for the entire squad, we have struggled to score recently(with the exeption of last week and the Utd. Game) so I could see him starting. Yet he hasn't played for 3 weeks so if he doesnt get picked(due to match readiness) Dzeko will probably be the starter. 

A good match up would probably be Flannagan vs. Navas, lets see if the young lad can keep up with our pacy winger. Also a continuation of Kompany vs. Skrtel will be seen, hopefully not as much shirt pulling. 

Silva will do what he does best, roam around the midfield opening space and being a pain on the Liverpool defense. Yaya will do what he has been doing all season, getting that final ball through for whoever is running into space or finding himself in that perfect position to score a screamer. Nasri usually looks to get into a position to score off 1-2-1 passes with Silva. Fernandinho will be extremely important in the transition to offense/defense as he always is, hopefully keeping Gerard quiet throughout the game. 

Demichellis was actually relatively good last match against liverpool, he kept Suarez relatively quiet(for being suarez that is). Clichy will hopefully not show his age this game, and keep quick Sterling checked. Zaba will be zaba, terrorizing Flannagan with the help of Navas.

Score prediction, if Aguero looks as good as he was the first half of the season, 3-1 City to win this game. Aguero 2, Nasri 1. Sturridge/Sterling combination getting one for liverpool.",0,1397173439,null,0,false,0,cgpdy5o,t3_22pspp,t1_cgpdy5o,t3_22pspp,null,1433301456,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3

Alberto we clearly bought for the potential and not to slot straight into the first team. He is a quality young talent.

He needs time and he has plenty of it on his side. He is worth the investment. 

Aspas on the other hand, even if he got the chances of a run of games, I'm not so sure he'd succeed. The game he played in against United he just looked out of his depth and often got bullied around. I do feel sorry for him because he hasn't had the run of games, but BR as we know, picks the team on merit - how well they've performed in training, so if he isn't cutting then he has no chance.

Most likely the same team as the West Ham game, maybe Lucas for Coutinho as a defensive insurance but doubtful. No chance Sakho is being dropped for Agger after a very good return from injury.

- **Watch out for**

Cafu. His performance will be hugely important. He is the most dribble past defender in the PL, so may be targeted. However his tackling is excellent, and on the ball he isn't too bad either. A good game from the young Scouser will be vital.

Also (if he plays) Dzeko V Mamadou. Big aerial battle that can make or break our defense from set plays, here's hoping Big Sak brings his A game. 

Oh and watch our for the search and rescue team, looking for Yaya after he mysteriously disappears into Jordan Henderson's pocket ;)

- **Historical Moments**

On real stand out one to me is Studge's screamer last season, and the fact he puts it into top gear for his ex-teams. Expect him to score. Also the pressure, for both teams, this match brings being heralded as the title decider. Don't think its that straight forward but definitely a big factor.

- **Prediction**

If we play or best, 3-0 to us. If we are poor, could be 3-0 to them, maybe 3-1 as we score tons. My guess, 4-2 LFC. Assuming we pick it up, as we have vs Arsenal, Spurs, Everton, united so far. We score tons but they do too.

It's a **refrigerator box** that's been painted. By college students. Who did an *okay* job. OP isn't even the one who made it; he/she just took a picture and posted it. 

Am I sour grapes because the 4th/10th Doctor shoes I spent hours painting only got like 22 upvotes? Probably. If you accused me of that, you might be kind of right. You'd probably be very right.

Then the hourly wage has to increase to £13.33 to earn the same amount. If the wages do not increase, then you still have to work 40 hours a week, so only if the wages rise can this happen. 
ALSO importantly, many disregard this, but you must see in the point of view of the employers. Many businesses may be able to afford it, but there are many that are already struggling so it may be very hard on them. This might mean letting workers go if they can't cut costs somewhere, which means higher unemployment.

Also there is also the problem on inflation. It seems counter intuitive to think that reducing the number of hours will increase unemployment, but depending on the economy different things can happen.",1,1397181365,null,0,false,0,cgpha1j,t3_22q48h,t1_cgpha1j,t3_22q48h,null,1433304028,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"**Tactics**: I hope we start with the 4-3-3 rather than the diamond. 4-3-3 allowed us to play on the counter against Arsenal and Everton very effectively - and since City will come here attacking, that should play into our hands - and offers better protection on the flanks - necessary against the likes of Kolarov, Zabaleta and Navas. I expect Rodgers to try and target Demichelis' lack of pace via Sterling and Sturridge. The makeup of the midfield trio will probably be Gerrard, Henderson and Coutinho. I expect Sakho to continue at CB, given the chance that Negredo or Dzeko starts.

**Watch**: **Gerrard's** going to have a lot asked of him. City tend to play 4-2-3-1 in big games, so he'll have Silva in central positions to deal with, as well as Nasri cutting in from the left. Plus he'll want to avoid a yellow card so as not to be suspended, especially for the Chelsea game. Plus his ability to contribute with long balls, set pieces, and possibly another crucial penalty. **Sturridge** and **Sterling** should have fun trying to expose Demichelis, and defensively, **Flanagan** will have to reign in his tendency to tackle against Navas, while **Skrtel** has to avoid MMA wrestling physical players - Dzeko/Negredo up front, and Kompany from set pieces.

**History/memories:** All recent memories, given City's rise and Liverpool's decline. Bellamy's brilliant performance in the Carling Cup semi-final from 2 seasons ago, the false dawn of Carroll's first two goals in a red shirt from the season before, and the way we managed to throw  away winning positions in both games against City last season - with the Etihad game last season also being the last sighting of a Steven Gerrard thunderbolt. This weekend wouldn't be the worst time for an encore...

**Prediction:** Both teams will score, because this is Liverpool's attack and Man City's attack and Liverpool's defence.

It's helping peoples mindframes adjust via necessity. It's healthy to work, even stacking shelves if the alternative is sleeping until 2pm, waking up and wanking off, eating beans on toast then sitting on reddit until 2am.

Just being around people and doing shit is better than that life. I am agsinst FORCING THIS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE THE STATE ENFORCES IT AS AN ENTITLEMENT TO 'BENEFIT', IF... And only IF COMPANIES THAT ARE PRIVATELY OWNED WITH PRIVATE PROFITS, PROFIT FROM THIS.

I predict exactly the same as the last matchup, with *maybe* Allen in place of Coutinho if we start to lose the midfield a bit. 

Watch out for: 

SAS get a lot of credit, as they obviously should. But to change things up, I would say keep an eye out for Henderson, Coutinho, and Sterling to fight in that central area and pressure the hell out of City's midfield core. 

Prediction:

I think both teams are going to get on the scoresheet, but here's where I'm sticking my neck out: I think City's back line, especially if they play Demichelis will get overrun by SASAS. Suarez by himself was making life very difficult for them at the Etihad, and with the added firepower of Daniel Sturridge's return, I can see nothing but problems for City. Speaking of the last fixture: We also didn't have Gerrard available. Having that anchoring playmaker allows Henderson and Coutinho to roam and pressure City's midfield, which will again trickle the ball to their defense and bite them in the ass.

Gerrard v Silva, if Gerrard  does his job we could see very low scoring City side.
  
Zaba/Navas overloading our left side and getting past whoever we play as LB.

true,MadArend,num20,,"&gt; He plays a different position than Lennon

To quote a North Vietnamese colonel, ""That may be so, but it is also irrelevant.""  The question is, does he add more to the lineup than Lennon?  Or, put differently, it is worth fielding a formation that accommodates both Kane and Ade, and drops Lennon (such as the first one I proposed)?

&gt; Soldado should not be played as a winger.

In that wacky 4-3-3 (and let's be clear, it's a bit wacky), he's not.  He's part of a front three that swaps places fluidly.  And he often floats out to the flanks, especially when he's paired with Ade (actually, they both do).  Though, to be fair, Bobby tends to float out to the right more than the left.  

I'm just trying to get Soldado and Lamela on the pitch together with as much creativity around them as possible, so we can get them firing.  Do you have a better formation to do that?

I thought it would be cool to share a bit of what someone can make from a decent 3D printer (Makerbot 2x) by doing replicas of things I find interesting (or what a client finds interesting, haha).  If you can assemble a team of pros to design, construct and finish a piece you realize that darn near anything is possible with enough money thrown at it.  I hope that's what I've been working towards because there's a lifetime of ""things"" to make, if I can keep my A-Team together.

I'll be sure to share it in finished condition and thank you for the interest.

The one change I could see is Pelle perhaps going with Aguero AND Dzeko starting up top, and pushing Yaya more forward while keeping Ferna back as a pivot, or something of that sort. In a game with such big implications, have to assume he will go all out. I think Pelle will go into the game with a very aggressive style of play, and attack early and often. Liverpool will surely do this the same as they have all season.
                                
Whomever plays at RM for the majority, (Navas, Nasri or Milner) vs. Flanagan will be a huge matchup. Demichelis vs. Suarez as well, since we can assume the faster Kompany will be marking Sturridge. 

The tension is always palpable, with both teams firing on all cylinders it could be the better performing defense that makes the difference.

It was eyeopening just how well the [bystander effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect) applied to this situation.

I now know that if anyone is having a seizure DO NOT place your fingers in your mouth, they will bite, *hard*. The entire cuticle of my left pointer finger was ripped off but I managed to move his tongue down from the roof of his mouth. Not sure if it even helped. The guy ended up being alright but it was certainly a wake up call and made me feel the need to teach someone the proper thing to do if they witness a seizure! Move their bodies away from anything that can harm them and let the seizure ride out!

true,FinalEdit,null,null,"No, not at all. Far from it. There are various media sharing systems - or ""Media Asset Management"" systems (MAM) on offer to various broadcasters.

For instance Quantel has one, but this is mainly for news channels - so it's interface is functional only in a fast turnaround news environment. This allows reporters to source footage and edit at their desks, saving the need for lengthy post production processes in most cases.

Avid have a system called Ardome, which was (I think) a Swedish company that they bought out around 2008 I think. This system is used by broadcasters such as IMG. The Ardome interface is a clunky HTML resource that can be accessed on a desktop. However it is notoriously slow and unreliable. Avid has patched this sytem into the EVS system which a studio gallery will use to capture any transfered edits and broadcast them.

However this system may or may not work with the multimillion pound Transmission set up that any given company has. This is why DMI didn't work. It's because ultimately you have 10 pieces of proprietry software and hardware, no single one designed to work with the other. When a project like DMI comes along, it has to create a system that can handle all of these external forces. For instance a broadcaster may transmit in MPEG2 but the Post Production systems may be standardised to use only the higher quality codecs, such as AVC Intra or DNX HD 185 - so a system has to be in place for the DMI to talk to a huge archive of backlogged material, send this material to a variety of bespoke or proprietary post production systems, then convert that material back into a format that the Transmission suite can handle and broadcast with little or no loss of quality. Imagine when bit of software #5 updates or issues a bug fix - it can fuck the whole chain from top to bottom. The DMI was never supposed to design new standardised broadcast sytems from edit to transmission - if it was the budget would have been in the billions, not the millions.

Add in the following variables: An edit post production system stores media on a network storage (essentially a huge RAID array) that's backed up two or three times for redundancy. This storage has to talk to the MAM, and the MAM has to talk to this storage. Making it even worse, the broadcaster has many different channels and genres so they use multiple incarnations of this system and switch between them depending on which genre they are working on. This allows many clients to connect and work on different things without slowing down the Sports News operation because someone's making a Peaches Geldoff obituary and hogging all the bandwidth. Now you have three or four bespoke systems all trying to talk to the MAM, which is also trying to sync with another ten databases of various idealogies. Then the Fairlight audio suite updates it's software, and suddenly you're back to the drawing board.

Back in the days of tape, everything pretty much WAS standardised. You had Digibeta, SP, SX, and a few varieties, which could all be played from one deck if it had the correct video boards installed. Everything went in via tape, and came  out with it. Keeping tape running costs millions and millions. It's roughly £150 per tape for 2 hours of full HD Digibeta SR. That's £1500 per box of ten. You'd get through that in half a football match, recording the feeds of at least six cameras, a clean and dirty version of each feed and then the TX output clean and dirty. 

Then when you get back into the edit suite with whatever tapes you need, you need to spend days ingesting them real time into the Avids. This is time consuming and soul destroying. DMI was seriously a good idea - but ultimately it was doomed to fail because of the sheer variables here.

So no, definitely not existing technology. Avid are trying to monopolise the broadcast market but all they seem to achieve is failure, by buying things they can't afford to maintain then charging clients extortionate charges to fix bugs. Then they close that branch of the company.

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; I wonder if anyone would actually kick up a stink if someone were to accidentally do something about it.

Not a stink but I'd certainly disagree strongly with it, it would be disregarding the little digital rights we have just because it *feels* right for this guy and his particular crime. He's in jail and when he gets out he'll have served his time, any of his property that is legal to own and was obtained legally should absolutely be returned to him.

It's easy to really not give a flying fuck about peadophiles but that's why we should be vigilant about this stuff because they are the easy target, you can do all sorts to them in violation of all kinds of rights and nobody bats an eyelid because peado.

Secondly, the guilt trip embarked on by 'Liberty' is quite frankly sickening. We can't change the law every time someone gets in front of a microphone and tells us how awful crimes are and cries a wee bit, again playing on the publics automatic position of not giving a shit about the peadophile. Any negative effects that happen to the girl as fall out from the way the law handles the situation are unfortunate but unlike an actual physical crime the outcomes aren't predictable and can vary in severity wildly.. so we shouldn't be making laws about it.

Lastly, people *really* need to get over the idea that they can own all instances of anything digital. If the police have determined that those photos aren't illegal then the family has nothing to do with it, they don't own those photos, they have no rights over them what so ever. We're going through a paradigm shift in how information exists in this world and the quicker we just give up the concept of ownership the better we'll be for it.

-----

Look, I'm not *trying* to stick up for the peadophile. I just think that the law should be logical and should respect the rights of both perpetrator and victim and if we don't apply that to every type of crime it's a worthless principle. People shouldn't get whatever they want just because they are victims and can garner a lot of public sympathy, the purpose of the legal system isn't to *fix* everything.. it's to punish people for the crimes they've committed and since the guy is in jail it has done it's job.

true,SourCheery,null,null,"&gt; It said the NHS saved £989 every time people were treated with cognitive behavioural therapy instead of going to hospital.

I recently spoke to my doctor about concerns I had about my own mental health.  Bipolar disorder in particular.  It took me 15 years to realise I had a problem, come to terms with it and seek help for it.  It hasn't been an easy ride.

My doctor referred me to a cognitive behavioural therapy unit.  This was a private company providing these kinds of services to the NHS.  I didn't get to meet anyone in person.  Instead they conducted a telephone interview with me and decided that I probably did have traits of bipolar disorder (not to mention a strong dislike of talking about intimate matters on the telephone to people I've never met).  

But they couldn't formally diagnose or treat it because that's not their specialty.  They don't deal in ""real"" mental health problems, just cognitive behaviour therapy.   Nor could they refer me to anyone else because they're a private company providing some (but not all) mental health services to the NHS.  For that I would have to go back to my doctor and ask to be referred to someone else.

I haven't yet and still don't know if I will.  To be honest I found the whole experience to be rather depressing, somewhat ironically, and fell into a bit of a slump.  From my own experience I know that it can be really, really hard to ask for help with mental health problems.  Harder still to have to *keep* asking for it.

Anyway, that's my guess as to how the NHS saves £989 when they treat someone with mental health problems using cognitive behavioural therapy.  After a phone call or two they can wash their hands of the patients who really do have mental health issues and need more than a quick pep talk.  Presumably the private company is still getting paid by the NHS for ""treating"" me.

""Joined up healthcare"" it ain't.

2) United and Tottenham both spent lots of money throughout the season, and both of them are languishing behind Everton

To say that LFC will drop out of the top 4 would say that at least two of the following will become better than them; United, Spurs, Arsenal, and Everton. 

Of those, United will likely have at least one more difficult transitive season, Spurs will run through 8 more decent managers meaning any progress they do make will be unstable, Everton have far less revenue than LFC, and Arsenal, whilst they do prove the biggest challenger, probably won't do much, whether Wenger retires or not, and even if they did, Liverpool would finish 4th.

It delegitimises the opposition, transforms the majority of the political discourse to 'should young people smash shit up' which the electorate almost universally responds 'no' to, and equates anyone with reasonable problems with austerity with the mob. Consequently, to get elected they have to denounce the violence and break away, splitting the left further.

Most people would describe this is the more simple terms that it doesn't work because the government doesn't listen.

I would imagine Pellegrini will target Liverpool's weak point, their defence. We'll keep hold of the ball and put constant pressure on them. Expect David Silva to be roaming in behind their midfield, finding space and picking up the ball, then to run at them or thread it through for the forward.

Toure will be picking up the ball from the back and making simple passes forward until Liverpool either leave him space to run into, or to play a ball direct to the wing or forward.

Zab will be Zab, he will be strong in defence, and gun forward when we attack. I can see Kolarov starting at LB, as he has massively improved this season, he will put constant pressure on their RB, and if he finds space he'll immediately get a good ball across.

Expect Nasri and Silva to be linking up with each other a lot. In previous seasons they would get in the way of each other, but now they have an understanding and just seem to know where the other one will be at all times. When they both get the smallest amount of space, expect them to be past the defence in a couple of quick passes.

Mr Scruton summoned the whole school into the
assembly hall this morning. Even the teachers
who are atheists were forced to attend. 

I was dead nervous. It’s ages since I broke a
school rule but Scruton makes you feel dead
guilty somehow. When the doors were closed
and the whole school was lined up in rows
Scruton nodded to Mrs Figges, who was sitting
at the piano, and she started playing ‘Hallelujah!’

Some of the fifth years (including Pandora)
sang along using different words: ‘Hallelujah!
What’s it to you?’ etc. It was quite impressive.
Though I thought it was time that the blind piano
tuner called again.

When the singing stopped and Mrs Figges was
still, Mr Scruton walked up to his lectern,
paused, and then said, ‘Today is a day that will
go down in history.’ He paused long enough for a
rumour to travel along the rows that he was
resigning, then he shouted, ‘Quiet!’ and continued, ‘Today at three minutes to nine a
future King of England was born.’ All the girls,
apart from Pandora (she is a republican), said,
‘Ooh! Lady Di’s ’ad it!’

Claire Neilson shouted: ‘How much did he
weigh?’

Mr Scruton smiled and ignored her.

Pandora shouted, ‘How much will he cost?’
and Mr Scruton suddenly developed good
hearing and ordered her out of the assembly hall.

Poor Pandora, her face was as red as the
Russian flag as she walked along the rows to the
exit door, when she passed me I tried to give her
a supportive smile, but it must have come out
wrong because she whispered, ‘Still leering at
me, Adrian?’

Mr Scruton dismissed the school after giving us a talk on what a good job the Royal Family do
for British exports.

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"&gt; Britain planned to build a **Taliban training camp for 2,000 fighters** in southern Afghanistan, as part of a top-secret deal to make them swap sides...The camp would also have provided **vocational training, including farming and irrigation techniques**, to offer people a viable alternative to growing opium.

&gt; But the Afghan government took issue with **plans to provide military training**, to turn the insurgents into a defence force.
Afghan government staff also claimed the “EU peace-builders” had handed over **mobile phones, laptops and airtime credit** to insurgents. They said the memory stick revealed plans to train the Taliban to use **secure satellite phones**, so they could communicate directly with UK officials.

&gt; Nato forces mistakenly **supplied food, water and arms to Taliban forces** in southern Afghanistan, officials today admitted.
Containers destined for local police forces were **dropped from a helicopter into a Taliban-controlled area** of Zabul province.

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/18/nato.afghanistan

&gt; MI6′s meetings with the Taliban took place **up to half a dozen times** at houses on the outskirts of Lashkah Gah and in villages in the Upper Gereshk valley, to the north-east of Helmand’s main town. The compounds were **surrounded by a force of British infantry** providing a security cordon.

&gt; In August 2007, the presidents of Afghanistan and Tajikistan walked side by side with the U.S. commerce secretary across a new **$37 million concrete bridge** that the Army Corps of Engineers designed to link two of Central Asia’s poorest countries.

&gt; Today, the bridge across the muddy waters of the Panj River is carrying much more than vegetables and timber: It’s **paved the way for drug traffickers to transport larger loads of Afghan heroin and opium** to Central Asia and beyond to Russia and Western Europe.

&gt; The U.S. is investigating allegations that some **officials in the Afghan Air Force, which was established largely with American funds, have been using aircraft to ferry narcotics and illegal weapons** around the country, American officials told The Wall Street Journal.

&gt; The United States has paid more than **$150 million to companies in Afghanistan that are accused of helping to finance terrorist attacks** on American soldiers and facilities, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR). **A list of 43 companies** in Afghanistan was compiled using data from both classified Pentagon investigative reports and Commerce Department lists of terror-connected companies.

&gt; Of particular concern was cargo ramp No. 5 at the airport, **where unscheduled aircraft were landing late at night and cargo was being unloaded in a hurry**, several Western officials said.

&gt; The airport is a joint civilian-military facility. **Unlike in most of the airport, the U.S.-led coalition has no oversight role at ramp No. 5**. A Western official called that cargo-loading area the **“Grand Central station of illicit activities”** in Afghanistan.

- Situations promised but no contracts written,

Only the MD listed as a director - this is a bit tricky and my knowledge of this is a bit sketchy (which is why, again, I advise you to find a lawyer) but as far as I understand it, you can have a number of directors whose liability in the company is dictated by the shares that is put in at the founding of the company, and you normally have a list saying ""Guy X - X shares, Guy Y - Y shares, Guy Z - Z shares"" and it is these shares that dictate precisely how much ownership you have of the company. It is my understanding that these are in the articles of association.

Since you have said that you were told and signed bits of paper saying that you were a director and the number of shares you held, it sounds (to me, on very limited information) that you were under the impression of being a director of a company as defined in the law. Since Companies House has only the one guy listed as a director, it appears that he is the only one that matters.

Now whether this guy formed the company beforehand and you came along later and hasnt bothered to update the companies house listing in the meantime (which is as far as I know a criminal offence) or whether he's pulled a fast one for many years, I dont know.

This where i disagree. and eriksen is a good example of what might have gone wrong.
Because we got illori and sakho and toure. We have been doing the rotation, so what happened to wisdom and kelly. For all you know wisdom and kelly would have been as brilliant as ster and cou.

The problem with getting marquee signings is that if that player does not stand up and get counted and becomes a squad member, it hurts our next gen and existing squad members.

So in that sense a luis alberto is better because then our allens and hendos are going to have a fair fight and not just be thrown into it because the star player is under-performing. The playing field is more level.

Anyways liverpool has mostly been about creating the star players rather than buying them and luis and aspas follow that model.

And that's exactly the point. If you allow the police to operate outside their remit in this case, because of the subject matter, you've set a precedent. Or worse, you've changed the law. Once you've taken that step, the context isn't important anymore. 

This time, it's a convicted paedophile who wants to keep distasteful (but legal) images of one of his victims. We'll just delete those ones. 

Next time it's a stalker who's been taking photos of his victim sunbathing on the beach and has been convicted of harassment. It's not right that he should keep all those photos of her. We'll delete them before returning his laptop. 

The time after that? A man going through a messy divorce who is falsely accused of rape by his spouse. It all works out OK in the end, but it's a little bit uncomfortable that he still has those videos he and his wife made together. Probably best to delete them, because now we have form for it and we could be held responsible if we give back things that the ex wife doesn't agree with. 

A few steps down the line, and it's really not right that this journalist got topless pictures of that celeb on the beach, is it? How about that guy who filmed the police acting illegally? 

It's a slippery slope, and the people at the top of that slope are always the ones most hated by society. You've got to look past that at what you're actually allowing to happen here.

The only reason they aren't tanking is exactly because the customer base is too loyal. They can be taken for granted, mostly.

Foods on the other hand doesn't have loyalty as such, more a general respect that the quality of the goods is above those of other supermarkets.

The staffing issues are down to a general trend across retail to do things with as little overheads as possible, squeezing as much out of the supply chain, staffing budgets, outsourcing everything where possible to the lowest bidder (e.g. cleaning, maintenance, logistics). New starters do not receive as many perks as existing colleagues, nor premiums such as working Sundays. Overtime is not unheard of, but is haphazard and usually means a stressful day as there are not enough colleagues to cover all customer bases (even with the overtime staff).

New starters at M&amp;S are placed on temporary contracts for as long as possible at wages approximately 10% below those of other colleagues. They have no notice period as such. These short-term contracts are rolled over again and again, in some cases over many years to avoid potential problems arising from having too many staff. But, with an aging work-force, you have to replace some staff who retire, go off sick or, bluntly put, die. Retailers in general, not just M&amp;S, do not replace these staff, expecting others to pick up the slack. OR, and this is the point of this entire thread, use other means. Mainly using ""volunteers"", work placements, workfare etc.

There are two possibilities with regards to the inmate. Either he honestly wants to reform or he doesn't.

If he doesn't want to reform, then keeping him in jail for longer will make children safer.

If he does want to reform, then it would be logical to think that he'd try to remove himself from temptation.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"It doesn't quite work like that, basically people operate at whatever the 'acceptable' work-rate in the organisation is. Slow workers will try to work harder to catch-up, fast workers will work slower to have a more relaxed time of it - especially if they get paid the same, why would they work twice as fast for no extra compensation?

So there is this accepted 'work rate', but there's also an amount of work expected to be done every day as well. You can't massively increase this, even if its perfectly doable for the fast workers, as people will feel they're working harder but not given extra compensation.

By keeping the amount expected *per day* the same though, but by reducing the hours available, the accepted work rate will increase. The fastest will work closer to their potential, the slowest will try to work harder still (or need retraining / 'restructuring'). Thus, a real productivity increase occurs, the company gets a benefit from not having to pay 40 hours a week per employee, and the employees get the benefit of having more free time.

Consider the flipside: a part-time worker who is moved to full time hours, will no longer have to 'rush' to finish their daily work. In effect, their productivity goes down. The more hours they do, the more its likely their productivity will fall, because they're still measuring themselves in 'whats an acceptable *days* work'.",0,1397223193,null,0,false,0,cgprngg,t3_22q48h,t1_cgprngg,t1_cgpev6a,null,1433308982,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"&gt; Well... yes? I mean what are you inferring there, that the emotions of the victim shouldn't be considered?

As I said shouldn't drive the process, otherwise we're on the road to lobotimising the criminal.

&gt;  I can't see any benefit in allowing the convicted pedophile to retain any images of the victim - in this case a child. 

Well:

* They're legally the possessions of the criminal.  
* Aren't they the father in this context? The article doesn't state it directly but I'm just reading between the lines here.

&gt; The difference is of course that digital images are tangible - they can be distributed or retained or mis-used.

Are you seriously suggesting that we'd change the law to prevent someone from digitally altering the photograph to make it explicit again? I'm getting Chris Morris style flashbacks here.

&gt;  In this case I'd have thought the two paramount concerns are the protection of any victims and the prevention of further offense.

And I'd agree. However since the individual has been convicted I would assume that the victim is now protected (in the literal definition of the word). The non-literal definitions open up a bag of subjective worms that are hard to fashion into the language of law.

I take issue with what is a fundamentally a psychological issue at play here. There is no empirical evidence to state that the victims psycological condition will be improved if the images are gone and there is never any means of being 100% certain the criminal never has access to images ever again. The police wont know if the images they find are all the images or not. We're discussing a ""peace of mind"" where the best case outcome isn't a ""yes"" but merely a ""probably/possibly"".

No information I gave while on JSA was ever investigated, checked or questioned. The fact that I was actually applying for and got a job was completely separate from the charade of what I had to tell them I was doing. I had to  tell them I was applying for all sorts of menial jobs. When I mentioned about the meaningful applications I was engaging in, typically outside the local area, and not menial, they basically ignored it, it didn't even count, not that it mattered, because they never checked to see if I was lying about any of it. I had to apply or say I was applying for a ton of menial, shitty jobs, 5 per week iirc, and it was all pointless.

I got the first 'real' job I applied for, which actually makes use of my degree and pays a living wage (far more in fact), but my interaction with the job centre was a complete farce just to placate them so that they would give me the JSA to which I was entitled.",0,1397224452,null,0,false,0,cgps2v9,t3_22p8yu,t1_cgps2v9,t1_cgpebui,null,1433309182,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'll jump straight in; we can't go defence minded in this game. If we let Liverpool come at us for 90 minutes they'll find a way through sooner or later. We need to play attacking football and go out there with intentions of scoring 6 or 7. 

Let's not forget this squad has improved massively over the last few months. Demichelis I no longer want to ship back to Malaga in a shoebox and is putting in some solid performances. We have a nippy Clichy who is looking better now than the beginning of the season whilst a series of absolutely on form midfielders. And, dare I say it, this is the first time all season where all 4 strikers are match fit?! The return of Aguero is welcomed by everyone except some Liverpudlians, yet as /u/topright and I were discussing earlier; a fit Aguero is different to match fit Aguero. Think back to the Barcelona match.

Do we stick with a 4-2-3-1 like over the previous weeks or do we switch to a 4-4-2? Or does Pellerz bottle it and play a defence minded side? Personally here's my starting 11:

Hart

Zabba - Vinny - Demi - Clichy

Ferna - Yaya

Nasri - Silva - Navas

Aguero

If Aguero isn't 110% I'll start Jovetic with an introduction of Kun towards the end of the game. I'll pop Dzeko on the bench too because after recent performances I feel he may step up if required and with Silva, Navas, Nasri and Aguero on the pitch we're not gonna win too many offensive headers. I'll also throw Milner on the bench too because he will give 100% in the defence and on the counter attack. A Javi Garcia may receive an introduction later on in the game depending on the scoreline and I wouldn't be surprised to see Kolarov come on if we're defending a lead.

I don't like to discuss the score or outcomes - I simply hope we have a fair match with no diving. If Suarez does go down on his own accord I hope he swallows half the pitch. No doubt L'pool will attack the Demi &amp; Clichy side of our defence but if Fernandinho tracks back he should be able to cover it, with Yaya too I see no problems.

If Yaya scores and we win I shall forever refer to him as *Mr. Touré* on /r/MCFC

Con's: Every word is recorded so there will be self consciousness, decision making is impacted.
Victims of crime already have enough stress talking to the police especially with a lot of distrust and hatred for the police. Seeing a copper with a big camera on their vest makes them realise it's not one person they are speaking with but possibly the whole world.
Same for suspects, the amount of people linked to crime that talk, you'll stand a fair chance of them shutting up when they see that they are talking to a camera and not a single person.

The thing is for policing to be effective there needs to be an element of trust put on police officers to do their job correctly. Remember in criminal investigations you never take a police officers word for anything, you have a collection of evidence, witness statements, physical evidence, etc. 

When it comes to using force though a camera will make no difference. PACE allows any constable to use what ever force they deem necessary and proportional to make an arrest, common law also allows the use of reasonable force. Reasonable force being what you honestly and instinctively think is necessary in order to stop an imminent attack, note this also allows pre-emptive strikes. Having a camera on all the time will not impact how force is used, people will still get put down if they get aggravated.

Cameras are also expensive, we are talking about the police here where everything is contracted out 20X wasting money. I'd rather see better response coverage first give forces more money. Cutting funding, then complaining about a poor response times to domestics then asking for a load of digital cameras for all police is just so ridiculous it's funny.",0,1397227836,null,0,false,0,cgpte9h,t3_22rkz2,t1_cgpte9h,t1_cgpon2t,null,1433309803,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

Good HR though will have people striving to as high a productivity for as long as possible (which includes keeping staff happy!). Bad HR is the trying to get more results just by shouting louder or keeping staff later and longer. 

This proposal is that the loss in hours is offset by the increase in productivity because in part of the psychological anchoring in employees of what a 'days work' should be, but also reducing staff fatigue. 

It will be different for every company of course, that's why HR exists to determine what are the best policies for their company.

This is possible but equally the officer is more likely to act in a way that he or she can later justify with the video footage.

true,[deleted],null,null,"We have legislation that protects people from depiction within literature and it's covered by defamation and libel laws - I believe that the men who Wolf of Wallstreet is based on is in the midst of a lawsuit on these grounds. If we can protect people from words it's hardly difficult to figure out a law to protect them from having images taken of them specifically when they do not want to. It doesn't need to interfere with surveillance, it simply means that people have rights to delete or remove images of them if they do not want them to exist. 

As for your list; general depictions so photos and video, there can be a body to enforce it or it can be assigned to existing legal bodies, civil (since similar laws are currently within civil), if some object and some don't is moot because I'm talking about singling people out, verification is hardly difficult since it's a photograph or video, you can easily notify people since you're literally there taking a photo of them - if you're close enough to take a picture, you're close enough to say 'excuse me, I'm a photographer and really like the mood/lighting/your expression here, are you ok with me keeping this image? Could you sign a release please, I can email you the photo if you'd like?', copyright laws at the moment allow for 'fair use' by news organisations so again, easily solved. Family members is again moot since you are either ok with the photo or you aren't. Yes, these things need to be considered but they're hardly insurmountable obstacles. 

Really, most of these items are easily dealt with and there are far more complex laws currently being enforced. The idea that people have a right to take photographs of whatever they want, however they want, is ridiculous. Most recently, it was ruled that upskirt photographs are perfectly legitimate in the eyes of the law (but quickly changed) http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/articles/2014/03/12/tighten-laws-on-upskirt-photos.html .

I did Physics but I dunno - if you can't program, then learn to program.

I'd recommend Python as it has loads of cool libraries so you can do really cool machine learning stuff like Kaggle and keep it all looking pretty in IPython Notebooks.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"DoF is a bit more complex than Technical director of the youth setup.  

He absolutely did a great job with the kids, and while some can argue that John McDermott deserves as much/equal amount of credit (which, he does deserve a good bit of credit for running the academy) as Sherwood it really seems that Tim tied McDermott's running of the academy with Ramsey/Les/other coaches implementation of the coaching across all the youth setup.  Tim deserves the credit for the work he did with the youth setup.

It's much like the situation with Tim as a manager, there is no saying that he couldn't do it one day do it, but there would be a learning curve.  It is a complex role that touches parts of every aspect within the club. It is the football equivalent of a GM in the NFL/NBA/MLB/NHL....its just a completely different skillset than a manager. Considering Tim's background is much closer to on the field management it would mean he would need to learn another skillset from where his experience lies.

A DoF (an effective one at least) needs to have a true understanding of not just scouting and development, but management, finance, how to deal with owners, chairmen and other DoFs, boards (not just the Spurs board but other teams as well) he needs to know how to handle agents, 3rd party owners and understand the numerous rules and regulations surrounding transfers not only in England but other countries. That is just for the transfer aspect of the role.

The DoF position is just as tactical as a manager of the squad, but the application of the tactics are different and equally complex, its not just something you throw someone into (NUFC learned this recently with the bellend Kinnear) and expect true success, it does happen of course, as does appointing an inexperienced manager from time to time, its a dice roll.

In a DoF system if we are unwilling to have a learning curve with a manager we need to be equally unwilling to have a DoF have a learning curve.

true,MrBenjaminBraddock,null,null,"I probably think the lineup would be something like:

                             Hart
      Zaba    Kompany      Demi          Clichy
                Ferna               Yaya
      Navas           Silva                     Nasri
                          Dzeko

Aguero would probably be making a 30-min cameo in the second half replacing Dzeko. Reason being he hasn't played a good couple of matches lately and wouldn't be best card to play in this crucial tie.

Ferna would be taken out for Javi in the middle of the second half regardless of whether or not we are doing well scoreline wise.

Navas would go off in the second half making way for either Negredo or Milner. Milner if we are not coasting already and for floating in those beautiful crosses into the box. Negredo if we are comfortable with the scoreline and just to hold the ball higher up the pitch.

Now to my suggested lineup, Clichy is a much better defensive player than Kolorov. Agreed, he has lost some pace and doesn't contribute readily when attacking this season but he is still very strong defensively. Kolorov does give an advantage when attacking but he doesn't quickly drop back and perform his defensive duties. With Suarez and Sturridge happy to switch positions between each other, they can exploit this gap quite usefully. They would be looking to use this gap to force Demichelis to concede a penalty or two and hope Gerrard can coolly convert his 12 yard spot kicks.

Add Sterling to the mix and he generally plays a wide man on the right and can add a nice 1-2 touch between both those players. For these reasons, I am going with Clichy more than Kolorov. 

As much as Liverpool defense is shipping goals to the opponents, they are also very good with dead ball situations. Suarez or Gerrard are picture perfect from free kicks and Skrtel or Agger can head in a goal or two as well. And, they are also pretty sharp from corners and such. They are much less susceptible from corners than open play.",0,1397231252,null,0,false,0,cgpuwh2,t3_22pspp,t1_cgpuwh2,t3_22pspp,null,1433310512,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

In addition to all this I had to deal with and manage what can only be described as the crazy situation of very limited support from those who should have supported the club and the management, whilst at the same time having little or no decision making ability. On occasions this resulted in my paying club running expenses on my personal cards and last minute dashes to wire personal money to the club to pay the HMRC.

“Notwithstanding, I did everything which was in my very limited power to take the club forward, to engage with the fans and the community and to keep the promises which were made to its great fans.

“I very much hope that the new owners will do the same and will deliver on the many promises and contractual commitments they have made to Leeds United, the players, the manager, the staff and fans and will run the club in the manner of the fit and proper owners they have been judged to be.

“I have arranged for Sport Capital to convert some of the loans made to the club into shares and once complete, those shares will be given to the fans, so it truly will be the fans’ club.

“Leeds is a fantastic club in a fantastic city and I wish Elenora Sports, Brian McDermott, The players, staff and fans all the very best for the future.”",0,1397232620,null,0,false,0,cgpvjaf,t3_22sc17,t1_cgpvjaf,t3_22sc17,null,1433310879,3,false,LeedsUnited,t5_2teb8,3

The same thing happened when he was put through by Eriksen. The only reasonably dangerous ball he put in was cleared by Bardsley and went out for a throw in. He added less than Chaldi - and considering Chaldi was basically playing as a holding midfielder (see the average position map from the game if you don't believe me) that's is saying something.  Chaldli  put Ade through  one on one with a lovely through ball around the 80 minute mark.  He offered less than Pailinho aswell who had brilliant movement and Created space for Ade and Eriksen throughout. His movement led to Kanes goal. Comparing lennons contribution to Paulinho and Chadlis is a poor comparison anyway consisting Paulinho and Chaldi we're playing CM while Lennon was a winger..

Your point on his dribbling is also nonsense. According to whoscored he didn't complete 1 successful dribble. Not one.

Your point on him taking smart shots is also laughable. The two shots he made were blocked by defenders so I doubt really see what the great virtue in that is.
