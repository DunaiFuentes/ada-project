It's - at best - mild dislike, because it doesn't really matter that much.

They are twats, though. The whole mes que un club lot of them. And their swivel-eyed fanboys.

As for immature. GYAC, the entire concept of supporting a football team and caring about the result is slightly mental, and without the pointless tribal hatred, it wouldn't be half as much fun. But I do accept there are those that appreciate football at an aesthetic level, who will enthuse about a match that ends 3-3 for the sheer beauty of it. 

But they're all wrong. I'd take a scrappy 1-0 win over a beautiful game any day, because what counts, THE ONLY THING that counts, is winning.

So, yeah, maybe there is some (not even thinly disguised) jealousy about their success. But so what? That's the beauty of the sport. The glorious, inane, biased and bigoted pointlessness of it all.

There are a lot of things wrong with OP's rant ([this one especially](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2a58mu/mes_que_un_club_hmm/cirm4ai)), and I'd love to go into detail, but just remember that during Joan Laporta's presidency Barcelona enjoyed a great deal of success playing with a vast majority of Catalan players, and we *are* very proud of that, and no one could ever take that away from us. Things have taken a turn for the worse since, and you'll find few Barca fans happy with the current state of affairs brought on by a disastrous board, so please don't be this harsh, we've got it bad enough as it is :)

Refusing to work for dodgy companies or non-payers is not illegal, because being dodgy is not a protected characteristic under anti-discrimination laws.

true,mr-strange,null,null,"Head-coverings used to be essentially compulsory for Christian women in the UK, especially within the lower orders, and especially in public. I'm old enough to remember old ladies who always covered their heads with scarves which were essentially indistinguishable from the hijab or chador - relics from the Victorian age.

Shedding this clothing style was inextricably linked with women's emancipation. Women who cover their heads were seen as old-fashioned at best, and reactionary and anti-women's-lib at worst. Consequently, white Western people have a deeply ingrained cultural dislike of such head-coverings - that dislike still persists, even though its cultural origins are mostly lost in the mists of time.

Although it's obviously become intertwined with more general ""Islamophobia"", there is clearly something special about head-scarves to Westerners. Notice that lots of other typically ""foreign"" styles do not cause similar tensions: turbans, shalwar kameez, etc.

I think that Muslims who come here ought to be understanding of this Western cultural peculiarity, just as we should accept their peculiarities. If we are to live side by side, then we all need to develop a bit more sensitivity to each others feelings. I believe that if Muslims were to have the origins of the Western suspicion of head-scarves explained to them, then it might help to diffuse the tensions that it creates on all sides. 

I certainly don't advocate banning any form of clothing. But just as I don't go into halal butchers and ask for bacon, Muslims ought to be cautious about how vigorously they assert their own culture in this regard.

Now for some more details on everything surrounding the club's friendly against Olympiacos at Soldier Field on July 27th:

* If you're after tickets, we have fellow Reds who can no longer attend that are trying to sell theirs at face value (often pre-sale face).  There are two single tickets, three sets of two, as well as a set of four.  Contact us if you're interested!
* The event on Friday night (July 25th) with Bruce Grobbelaar will be held in partnership with the 23 Foundation.  Much like our fundraiser with them a few years back, the event will feature auctions and raffles for several great prizes, including signed shirts!  This event will be held at A.J. Hudson's and will begin at 7pm.
* The event on Saturday night (July 26th) will feature none other than Robbie Fowler and Ian Rush!  The duo will host a Q&amp;A session, there will be merchandise for sale, there will be a limited amount of autograph signing and LFC TV will be out and about!  This event will be held at A.J. Hudson's and will begin at 7pm.
* Prior to the event with Rushie and Fowler on Saturday, between 5pm and 7pm, the club will be hosting a limited entry Training Session at Soldier Field.  Entry will be limited and the club have asked us to give them a rough estimate of how many people we expect to take to the training session.  If you are interested in going to the Training Session, send us an email, so that we can let the club know how much interest there is.

The 'foolproof' way of recording a visitor's IP would be to grab the address the TCP connection is made by, however if there is a proxy in between this will be the address of the proxy, not the user. Generally proxies will send an extra header to disclose the true IP, but this leads back to the problem above whereby they can be easily tampered with.

The IP recovered was for a (likely among other things) web server, it's possible a flaw on one of their websites/apps was found that allowed somebody to use it as a proxy, whether by gaining direct control or maybe exploiting a form that could be used to send arbitrary requests.

These are more opportunist scenarios, somebody would discover the flaw/exploit then come up with this as a way to abuse it rather than going out with the intention of pulling this exact stunt.

If neither of those are the case (and related things like the attacker simply having access to their network), I do believe it is still possible but rather unlikely.

I'm just saying that there still are ways to make the subreddit less vote brigadable, there are trolls sure, but people upvoting/downvoting is more generalised popularity, and a seperate issue than trolly shitposts, which are immensely easy to deal with. 

From my experience there actually are a great number of people who come onto other people's subreddits and downvote/upvote because they genuinely disagree with them, like if you linked /r/theredpill to most people, they would vote very differently to normal users of that sub. For better or worse, that sub's community has its own views on women that most people wouldn't agree with.

If you instead linked it and on the post reminded people that this was purely observational and that we shouldnt be trying to affect the subreddit (Like a lot of ""observational"" subreddits like SRD do), people more often than previously leave the downvote button alone.

I would wager a lot of the downvotes/upvotes from /r/gunners are not from the people coming here and trolling, but from gunners who come here to see our reactions to things, and then downvoting/upvoting stuff they don't agree with, without actually realising that they shouldn't be doing so because it's not a subreddit tailored for them.

Luckily his mates weren't also massive pricks and told him to leave it off and they apologised to me and dragged him out the pub while staff called the coppers.

Tolerance and the recognition that we are all one big family is what Christians should be.  Islam on the other hand is quite categorical in its intolerance of gays...

Anyway all this is beside the point.  Should a business that operates within a mixed community be allowed to discriminate based on religious belief?  I'm not sure.  I'd like to think the law would say you must not discriminate.  However, this then discriminates against those religious groups that feel such behavior is wrong, by Jove!  This can have implications for all of us e.g. an atheist business may want to refuse to print fliers aimed at recruiting vulnerable people into a Church or Mosque on grounds that it wants no part in indoctrinating people during stressful periods of their lives.

It's not the same circumstance but consider Real Madrid bringing Bale in last summer.

Was he worth 100 million Euros last summer? Most people said no, probably not.

But, he helped Real Madrid with their Copa del Rey and more importantly the Champions League, La Decima.

At this point it's non issue. Most expensive transfer in the world, but he won Real their tenth European title. That's a huge deal, it brings in a ton of direct and indirect money, and has huge significance.

I think the club is overpaying for Luis but if he tightens up our already really tight defense and helps us win the league, like you said, he pays for himself.

https://www.flickr.com/photos/rnuk/6788847565/

In fact, head over to Issy Kol and just circle it. Find out where the minibuses leave from and just hang around. Making friends is incredibly easy, even if they don't speak English (it's worth learning some Russian, it's a bit more portable a language than Kyrgyz and Kazakh). We were invited to a local family's feast (sadly we couldn't attend because we were heading for the yurt), and if you see a wedding procession, join in; you will definitely be made welcome.

Also, make a move toward Altan Arashan. It's a small settlement above Karakol on the eastern shore of Issy Kol. Victor will drive you up from Karakol in his old jeep https://www.flickr.com/photos/rnuk/6795845587/

They used a slightly different argument, they said that they wouldn't allow unmarried couples, of any orientation, to share a room. It kind of unravelled because they made no attempt to verify that straight couples were actually married. Arguing that they wouldn't rent a double bed to a couple of straight guys is equally lacking in credibility, why would they even want a double bed? They are just excuses, the B&amp;B were discriminating.

Now I am not trying to defend the cake shop as their actions are bigoted. But I think in fact if a straight person had asked for the cake (eg to surprise a gay couple they know) they would also have been turned down. The owners don't like gay marriage and don't want to create a cake to promote it.

I don't think that is just a made up excuse like the B&amp;B case, I honestly think the bakery would refuse to make that cake for anybody.

That isn't discrimination, the customer isn't even gay, so how could it be? But if the customer did happen to be gay, it wouldn't suddenly become discrimination.

I'm not a lawyer, and I don't like what the shop have done, but I don't see where there is discrimination?

If you are going to rent a car rent it on the edge of town (say at London-Heathrow) and take the underground to the airport. Driving in downtown London SUCKS.

* Small talk among strangers is much less common over in the UK, I would recommend against it unless someone else initiates it.
* Public Transport within London is amazing. Public transport via railway to other cities is also pretty darn good. You will not need a rental car except to go to places that are in the middle of nowhere.
* I highly reccomend paying for an unlock code so that your phone can use international SIM cards and buying sim card over there. It cost me $30 for an unlock code and 5 pounds (~$10) for sim card. It was completely 100% worth it. The ability to use google maps and whatnot while over there was amazing.
* Go to an ATM and get cash, then pay in cash while over there. 

Feel free to PM me if you have any questions, I went over there for 2 weeks in early late March so I can may be able to answer questions from a travelers perspective.

The Tube is kind of expensive, but London is just a reasonably expensive city in general.

Photo 1: successfully negotiated a plate by whispering to the barmaid last night 'any chance we could have our burgers on plates to stop my friend from having a meltdown please?.' Win! However, said Samson man lurched out of his chair like a crazy man when I pointed out them serving a full bloody cod and chips dinner to another quizzer on a chopping board. That's right, fish and chips are now being victimised too.

Pictures 2 and 3 - today's skanky dinner. What IS that you ask? Is that... is that a wooden beer tray?

Yes, that's right, a nasty looking and extremely worn out beer tray with the burger straight on it. It looked about 30 years old.

Apparently now ANYTHING that's wood goes when it comes to serving food on. Any day now I expect the chef just to flop out his cock with a little mini burger on it.

There are many ways to dress modestly in order to prevent yourself from being judged, which do not come with the disadvantage of wearing the hijab.  

Therefore it seems to me that there must be another reason why the hijab is encouraged. The places where it is most popular tend to be the more religiously conservative parts of the Islamic world, where women are not treated equally to men. In these countries, where often women are not allowed to drive to leave the house without a man, the hijab seems to be used as a way of cutting off the women from everything that the men in her life do not want her exposed to. That seems to be the purpose of the hijab in many cases, and that should be considered when we talk about peoples personal freedoms.

It's making very strong assumptions about the acceptance of the attention.  
The genders often fail to empathise with each other, as such men think its fine to harass women in the street and remark upon them in a sexual nature whereas women often don't understand the potential loneliness of a man.  

My personal observation is that the more sexist a society is the more cat calling goes on... which doesn't look good for South America. Also you might want to check your perspective, that sounds a lot like a male assuming what the women thinks without appreciating her perspective.

**Leave your knife at home.** Doesn't matter how useful it is or that it's normal to carry one in the States. In the UK it's viewed as a weapon by the public and the police.

It's not necessarily bad to come across as a stereotypical American. No one is going to be offended that you tipped them. A waiter will probably ask 'Are you finished?' before taking your plate away. You will have a level of cultural ignorance and that's fine, it's not like you've have decades of living here taking in the odd nuance to the point where you'd actually have trouble identifying them.

true,kingofeggsandwiches,null,null,"Your friend is messing with you quite clearly. The myth that English beer is warm is because in England there's four kinds of beer here: Ale, Bitter, Stout and Lager. All but lager are served at cellar temperature, which means it shouldn't be warm but it won't be chilled either, a bit like red wine. Lager is by far the dominant beer in the US to the point where beer just basically means Lager. In the old days Yanks would come into pubs, ask for a beer or be bought one by a Briton, be given some ale and then wonder why it wasn't icy cold and tasted different. They'd then of course go home to the US and spread the idea that Britons drank funny tasting warm beer rather than realise they were getting a totally different drink from what they'd expected. If you order lager it will always be cold unless you've happened upon the worst pub in the UK somehow. A tip for ordering: use ""I would like a"" or ""Could I have a"", don't say ""Can I get a..."" or ""I want a..."" the latter are considered uncouth, I won't lecture you on please and thank you since coming from the deep south I'm sure you're well aware of these. 

In regards to pubs, realise that in almost all drinking establishments (not restaurants) you're expected to go up and pay for your drinks at the bar then carry them back to your table, if there are staff wandering around it's likely that they're just wiping down tables and aren't waiters who want to take your order. Use your common sense of course if they're taking orders from other people it might be that you're somewhere that does do it this way. 

Don't cross your utensils, put them together vertically on your plate knife facing inward when you're done. Not a clue where your friend is getting these ideas from. Another tip in this area would be to eat with both utensils at the same time. Don't chop your food then set your knife down and use your fork like a skewer and spoon, it seems juvenile to Europeans. 

Don't call us Brits, we never refer to ourselves as that except occasionally on reddit to blend in. We're all Britons at worst, preferably English, Scottish, Welsh and Irish, don't insult any of the latter by calling them the former. 

Don't rent a car in London it's the worst idea imaginable, you won't find anywhere to park to start with or you'll get tickets from not understanding the rules, the traffic is horrendous, you'll get lost so it'll end up taking more time than the tube / buses.  You don't need a car at all to be honest, the train will take you to all the important places. If you do want a car then wait until you're done with London, find a place outside the city reachable by public transport and drive when you want to explore the rest of the country. Even then be wary of British driving rules, there's no left turning (right turning in USA) at red lights, even when it's clear, there's no rules about coming to a complete stop, there's lots of roundabouts (always give way to the right), there's lots of zebra crossing (crosswalks) where pedestrians have right of way, never pass on the left on a multi-lane carriageway.

He felt 'pressured' to work additional hours without pay in order to hit targets so that he didn't get performance managed out of the business. This is different than actually being told you have to work the extra hours.

If they say you have to work the extra hours then you have to get paid minimum wage for them - if you choose to work them off your own back then you don't. In this case it sounds like the latter, even if his team manager encouraged it.

e.g. If you are at a furniture factory and get paid £10 an hour, you may have a performance target of attaching 100 legs to chairs every hour. If you attach 80 legs an hour the company can fire you if they want, as long as the target is reasonable and they follow a fair performance management process. If you as an individual decide to stay after hours to hit your personal target then the company isn't required to pay you - if the company says you have to stay behind then they are.",1,1404854771,null,0,1404855142,0,cirym33,t3_2a5l36,t1_cirym33,t1_cirtbsn,null,1434615325,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I'm pretty sure they have special ones for foals. And pass this onto your friend: http://www.thehorse.com/articles/10250/feeding-the-orphan-foal

Foals usually adapt to a bucket fairly readily. Start by letting your orphan suck on your milk-wet finger (if he does not take hold at first, move your finger against his upper palate and tongue to stimulate the nursing response), then gradually draw him toward the milk until he is drinking from the bucket. Gently remove your finger. This process sometimes takes some patience, but most foals will begin to drink unassisted from a bucket in two hours or less (some only take a few minutes to catch on).

true,OptioMkIX,,Hang Parliament,"&gt;Neglect of the mentally ill is bad enough, but now consider how the Department for Work and Pensions deliberately torments them. I just met a jobcentre manager. It had to be in secret, in a Midlands hotel, several train stops away from where she works. She told me how the sick are treated and what harsh targets she is under to push them off benefits. A high proportion on employment and support allowance have mental illnesses or learning difficulties. The department denies there are targets, but she showed me a printed sheet of what are called ""spinning plates"", red for missed, green for hit. They just missed their 50.5% target for ""off flows"", getting people off ESA. They have been told to ""disrupt and upset"" them – in other words, bullying. That's officially described, in Orwellian fashion, as ""offering further support"". As all ESA claimants approach the target deadline of 65 weeks on benefits – advisers are told to report them all to the fraud department for maximum pressure. In this manager's area 16% are ""sanctioned"" or cut off benefits.

&gt;Of course it's not written down anywhere, but it's in the development plans of individual advisers or ""work coaches"". Managers repeatedly question them on why more people haven't been sanctioned. Letters are sent to the vulnerable who don't legally have to come in, but in such ambiguous wording that they look like an order to attend. Tricks are played: those ending their contributory entitlement to a year on ESA need to fill in a form for income-based ESA. But jobcentres are forbidden to stock those forms. These ill people's benefits are suddenly stopped without explanation: if they call, they're told to collect a form from the jobcentre, which doesn't stock them either. If someone calls to query an appointment they are told they will be sanctioned if they don't turn up, whatever. She said: ""The DWP's hope is they won't pursue the claim.""

* If you drink lager, it will be cold. If you drink ale (and I recommend you at least try a few real ales), then it will be warmer than you're used to. Not warm, but not cold - cellar temperature.

* If you see a queue, respect it. Don't try to push in. It's a big deal here.

* Try not to shout, or talk over anyone. Our normal talking volume and pace is a lot lower and more relaxed than yours. This is one of the main things about Americans that grates on us.

* Don't rent a car in London. Public transport can be pricey, but in London it's very very good and driving is a nightmare. Outside of London check the train service to where you want to go. You can also check National Express or Megabus for a cheaper, but lengthier option.

* Don't talk to people on the tube.

* Don't tell us how much bigger things are back home. We know, and we think it's extravagant and unnecessary.

* Talking about money is generally more frowned upon. Asking someone what they earn, or how much something cost - or telling people how much you earn, etc.. be tactful with this kind of conversation.

* Generally anything that could be construed as bragging will make people not like you. We prefer a little humility.

* It's generally considered bad manners to cross your utensils, you just place them on the plate side by side. This isn't particularly important though, unless you're somewhere very fancy.

Hope you have a good time! You should definitely visit some more places towards the north of the country if you get chance, London is practically a different country to the rest of Britain, so if you're here, it's worth experiencing both.

&gt;

&gt;The __UEFA Europa League__, previously called the __UEFA Cup__, is an annual men's [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) club competition organized by [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) since 1971 for eligible European football clubs. Clubs qualify for the competition based on their performance in their national leagues and cup competitions.

&gt;Previously called the *UEFA Cup*, the competition has been known as the *UEFA Europa League* since the [2009–10 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009%E2%80%9310_UEFA_Europa_League),   following a change in format. For UEFA footballing records purposes, the UEFA Cup and UEFA Europa League are considered the same competition, with the change of name being simply a rebranding. 

&gt;In [1999](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_in_association_football), the [UEFA Cup Winners' Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Cup_Winners%27_Cup) was abolished and merged with the UEFA Cup.  For the 2004–05 competition a group stage was added prior to the knockout phase. The 2009 re-branding included a merge with the [UEFA Intertoto Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Intertoto_Cup), producing an enlarged competition format, with an expanded group stage and changed qualifying criteria. The winner of the UEFA Europa League qualifies for the [UEFA Super Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Super_Cup) and from the 2015-2016 season onwards the winners of the previous season's [UEFA Europa League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014%E2%80%9315_UEFA_Europa_League) will qualify for the [UEFA Champions League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_UEFA_Champions_League), the winner entering at least at the play-off round (assuming they do not already qualify through domestic performance), and will enter the group stage if the berth reserved for the Champions League title holders is not used.

It's a definite reboot and the early episodes are very different as far as I know. I wouldn't skip the first season. Like /u/Fireblend said: Start with season 5. That's a point where you could start. You'd still be missing certain story elements though. Just keep going. Season 1 is different. The ninth Doctor takes some getting used to. I loved him, but I can get why some don't really like him. But those people still love the tenth and eleventh Doctor. 

**GREAT EDIT:**
I forgot: my girlfriend and I are currently re-watching all the episodes of Doctor Who (since 2005). Before we dated, she only watched **season 5 and on**. She really liked it. Which tells me season 5 is a **good starting point** if that's what you want. But since we started dating, we started at the Ninth Doctor and are almost at the Eleventh again. She really likes it, although she did think the ninth Doctor was a little *odd* at first. Different from the Eleventh and different from the 5th season and on.

A TCP connection requires bidirectional communication, so it's not just a 'someone spoofed it' deal. It's more likely that the forum admin was lying or confused about the information they saw, or even that the DM was for some reason running an open proxy (because they got hacked somehow), than it is for someone to 'spoof' their IP.

The reason why an IP address is not identifying data  in general is that home connections a) get reassigned often, and b) can be accessed by multiple people. In the case of an IP address statically assigned to a certain corporation, it's much more likely that connections which come from those IP addresses are due to action of people within that corporation.

When we have a housing shortage, with senior MPs honestly talking about bricking over the countryside to build housing estates.. the fact that we have net migration of roughly 230,000 isn't a help, is it?

When we have senior figures in the NHS saying that in London, it is overcrowded and on the verge of collapse.. the fact that London's population is continually growing isn't a help, is it?

These are serious issues and the amount of people in a given space is bound to have an effect on the availability of resources within that space. There is no way around that, and you certainly can't dismiss it by saying ""you're blaming the immigrants!"".

This sort of response is typical of those on the left. It is essentially a way of dismissing factual claims about the sheer numbers of people in the country and the affect that those numbers have on the resources, and instead pretending that they are simply concerns that are based in hate.

Through the filter of political correctness, ""the density of population is increasing at too great a rate for it not to have negative effects on the infrastructure of our country"" becomes ""THESE BLOODY FOREIGNERS, KICK ALL THE IMMIGRANT SCUM OUT"".

I guess maybe one thing I might offer is that queuing is serious business here, and some visitors may commit unintentional etiquette violations owing to the British ability to form implicit queues that are not immediately visible, such as in a par/pub.  

(There's not a _line_, but there's still a queue, the bar staff are usually good at keeping track of it but occasionally they mess up and offer to serve someone who just arrived before someone who's been stood there a while.  In this situation the newcomer is supposed to nod at the patiently waiting person and say, I think he was first?, or else is a cunt.  But obviously non-Brits would probably be excused the cunt judgement on that scenario, anyway.  I digress.)

[This is an interesting read](http://www.sirc.org/publik/pub.html) on that sort of topic, although do bear in mind it's nearly 20 years old, so some of it seems quite old fashioned / provincial.  So really don't take that sort of guide too seriously.  Many 'British etiquette guides' seem to be promoting a formal kind of etiquette that is honestly the preserve of a tiny fragment of old-school upper classes, where as the modern Everyman Brit stopped giving a shit about napkin vs serviette crap decades ago.

What interests you?

Tbh with 3-4 days to cover Dover, Bishop's Stortford and Scotland (!) I'd say you don't really have time to add more to your agenda, unless it's en route.

Why Dover btw?  The castle's cool but beyond that it's not really the most touristy of places, and the white cliffs are best seen from a boat leaving the country, which isn't exactly going to fit your agenda either.

Roy’s transfers were not under the Moneyball strategy (the only ones that would be viewed in that light would be Wilson and Shelvey and they agreed terms when Rafa was gaffer) with a majority of his recruitments being past 26 (Poulson, Konchesky, Cole), which is not a normal Moneyball procedure unless they are a free (Doni, Bellamy and Kolo) and with no clear long-term strategy. We did finish 6th that season, but that was more with Kenny bringing out the best in our current squad (Agger being the prime example—who was frozen out by Roy) but Comolli did have an influence in the second half of the season with Suarez and Carroll. Roy had us in a horrible predicament at the start with a worse starting XI than Rafa had the term before (Mascherano), so again I don’t think that should taken into account. But again, the team began starting to perform when Kenny took over which led to our 6th place finish. 

I don’t know how you can say that Suarez and Henderson are the only credited “success” players to pan out of this. Enrique has done his job quite well (a decent LB Is hard to find) and Bellamy was instrumental in us winning the League Cup. 

Ok. In the 12/13 season Sturridge, Coutinho and Sterling undoubtedly became a success but by your logic they wouldn’t be because we finished 7th the year they featured primarily for the first team with 61 points. Also, Rafa signed Sterling in 2010, so does that count (There is a reason why I didn’t mention anyone other than Comolli signings)? 

I never said that Liverpool should strive to be a mid-table team. All I was saying is that we should call a spade a spade and Comolli ushered in some good signings for Liverpool and we are reaping the benefits with excellent management by Rodgers.

He trashed all the attitude-problem doubters, scored for fun and became a vital cog in last year's team that came so close to winning the league. 

He could have been the team's best player if it wasn't for Suarez. In spite of Daniel's exquisite season, the Uruguayan was simply better. At some point he must have had a feeling of déjà vu, as no matter what he did, people would look through it and focus on Suarez. Last season he just couldn't be his teams 's number one star, no matter what. Just like he couldn't be a starter at Chelsea a few years ago no matter what.

This season comes with yet another chance for Sturridge. To prove himself worthy of all the limelight that comes with being Liverpool's #1 player. He must be truly relishing this. He has the ability. He has the experience, he has the quality. He just needs to prove it.

All of the others have either been sold or released, and Enrique made only 7 appearances last season (as much as I'm sure we'd have been stronger if he'd been fit). 

I still remain unconvinced. I don't think he did a terrible job, but I also don't buy that he was particularly great either, or at least any better than anyone else we've had signing players for a stint of time recently. The guy spent over £100m on a number of players, he'd have been hard pressed to do that without at least a couple of them being a success. Tomkins' 40% law might dictate that it's incredibly rare for clubs to consistently find success in the transfer market as most transfers are doomed to flop, but by the same margin you can flip it on its head and suggest that actually it's rare that clubs consistently make terrible signings and it's usually only slightly more than half which do badly.

I also think any claims of ""massive profit"" and such are really skewed by the fact that Suarez is going for so much money. If he's letting one signing basically make up for a large amount of losses on almost all the other signings, then that's entering venture capital type business models, and it's an incredibly high-risk way to make investments. If Suarez had left for £40m last season (which is what we apparently expected him to be worth based on the contract clauses from when we signed him) then we probably wouldn't have Champions League football this season, and the Comolli era would have left us substantially out of pocket on top of that.

Well there we go.  Bloomsbury is upmarket residential/scholarly/conservative, even for central London.  You would stand out like a sore thumb there.  Move a mile or two east to Hoxton or Shoreditch and you would probably be one of the tamely dressed folk. 

The centre of London is odd to define too. I'd imagine everybody has their own definition, a lot of people will have different ones, mine would be roughly everything inside the circle line.  Maybe from Tower Bridge in the east to Hyde Park in the west, Regents Park/London Zoo in the north to the South Bank in the south.  That's probably five miles by three miles.  London is ridiculously big, the metropolis is probably 35 miles by 30 miles.  Going back to one of the original points (in the unlikely event that the OP is still reading these posts) it's why having a car in London is an awful idea unless you desperately need one. Public transport is widespread and it is significantly cheaper and less stressful than trying to find somewhere to park!

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"They won the Champions League twice, sure, that's a great achievement. Never said it wasn't. But I think 13 trophies in four years is a bit of a misleading statistic when actually only 6 of those are proper competitions that last the full season. Supercups and the World Club championships are just a handful of games, and usually against competition that aren't that strong. 

Those Spanish Supercups were three single 90 minute games against Bilbao, Real Madrid and Sevilla. Just that, for three ""trophies"". And again two more 90 minute games for two more UEFA Supercup trophies. You can't count them on even close to the same tier as winning the Champions League or La Liga. Liverpool fans talk of the 2000/01 era as the 'treble season', not the 'quintuple season', because nobody seriously counts the UEFA Super Cup or the Charity Shield as proper trophies.

When you actually look at the proper competitions: 3 league titles, 2 champions league titles and a domestic cup in four years, it's really not all that impressive. It's a great haul, and I'd jump at the idea of Liverpool having that kind of success, but it's far from complete dominance of anything. 

&gt; There has more or less never been a team that successful in Europe and I think we will have to wait a long time to see another. 

This in particular is complete nonsense. In three years they won the Champions League twice. That kind of success in Europe has easily been seen before: Real Madrid won it five years in a row, Ajax won it three years in a row in the 70s, as did Bayern Munich. Liverpool had similar dominance in the late 70s and early 80s winning it twice in a row and then another two times in four years a few years later. All of which also in the old format where you had to win your league or the European Cup the year before to even qualify for the tournament.

Barcelona were comfortably the best club side for that period, but there was nothing particularly exceptional about it. Give credit to the success, sure, but to be honest saying things like ""there has never been a team that successful in Europe"" is exactly the kind of hyperbole that the OP was ranting about. There not only has been, but there have been *more* successful teams. There have been multiple times, and there will be again.

true,NEWSBOT3,cnty-uk,Londontown,"right, so you can claim for all the kids regardless of your job status. (Up until you earn a certain amount, but if you earned that you wouldnt be posting asking for help here so whatever.).  Be sure to do that. Make sure you use the 'mse benefits checker' to claim all you are entitled too (i cant link it, google for that phrase).  Yes, dealing with the job centre is a complete nightmare. Do it anyway, chase them up, make sure you get what you are entitled to, even if it means chasing the benefits folks constantly. 


The moneysaving expert forums (again google for them) are an excellent resource and are probably better suited to your circumstances, so i would look at posting there too. There are many other low-income folks, benefits advisors etc that hang round there and so they'll be able to advise you pretty well. The MSE site is excellent and a good resource for finding the cheapest way to to budget, spend things etc. Be sure to use it whenever you are thinking of spending etc.


You need to sort some GCSEs or something equivalent out - talk to your local college(s) about adult education, explain your situation. You arent the first person without GSCEs so they should have some idea on your options. So heres's the fun part. GCSEs/whatever are largely bullshit. All they are are is way to get your CV into the right place to get an interview. Job interviews are 90% about your personality and 10% about your skills. Almost every job is going to take a person they like over a person that's qualified, because when you work with someone you want to get on. Skills can be learnt on the job. You've managed a pretty readable reddit post which frankly is better than a large portion of people I've worked with in the past, so I'm pretty sure you can do alright given the chance.


So thats a thing you need to sort out just to get past that barrier. Costs should be low/none if you are on benefits, because they love anything to get you off them.  If you have *any* relatives , friends, acquaintances at all , talk to them and ask if they might know any opportunities. All you really need is that first one, and then as long as you dont screw it up, one or two years down the line you swap to another job and you've got experience - it's just getting that first chance. 


Apprenticeships could be an option, BUT they pay shit (ie, £2-3 an hour, vs the minimum wage at £6+).  You probably cant afford it given your circumstances. That said, some of the skilled trades like plumbers, electricians, carpenters etc are massively in demand because no english people do them any more. I know plumbers and electricians earning crazy amounts of money. So, if you can get into a skilled trade like that, there is a decent demand and its not bad money once you get into it. do some googling for the national careers service - they should be able to advice on various options including funding, writing a cv, interview tips etc, and they might be an option to get you sorted in something and sort funding etc as well. Be polite and persistant, you never know where it can get you.



and last, but most important tip, never give up hope. You can do this, you will do this. It might not be easy, but you are willing to try, and that's really the most important step there is.

Especially against weaker opponents where they have a low defensive line and not high pressuring against us a poacher is perfect. He knows his job is to stand between both of the centre halfs and destroy for them, nothing else. I do not see anything negative getting him for 1-2 season. 

There is no other striker available who can give us something extra at this point, who also wants to come and does not cost 400-500 million. 

Rather Get Markovic and Shaqiri + Huntelaar would be a good overall replacement for Suarez. Getting 2 future world class players and a poacher.

That being said, he was caught out of position multiple times during Germany's many counters which contributed to many goals.

 Now with that also being said, this complete dissection of Brazil's defense wasn't just because of Luiz. He was fielded with a back four of Marcelo, Dante and Maicon--three of these four defenders consistently make marauding runs with no penchant for tracking back. All three of these defenders were constantly chasing the German's counters and struggling to regain their already loosely set formation. Watch the game again and it will be so painstakingly obvious that Germany sat and waited for Brazil to lose the ball and countered into the wide-open space left behind by the offensive defenders.

In the end, Scolari fucked Brazil just as much as they fucked themselves. The midfield he fielded was never going to be able to retain possession against the well-drilled German mid. Scolari set up his squad to latch onto long balls and have Bernard beat players on the counter. This obviously didn't work and pretty much confirmed what everyone thought would happen--just at a much greater magnitude than imagined. 

Back to Luiz though--he had many great long balls, he won tons of tackles, he was all over the pitch trying to make up for his inept team, and of course he was getting caught out of position. But again I think their loosely set formation composed of attack-minded defense highlighted his lapses and made them look much worse. Just compare even when Silva--a tactical and natural leader--was in the squad and you can see how Luiz was much more anchored. This was really just the wrong German team and time to become blinded by national pride and fall apart, but if anything I feel this tournament showed David Luiz' real skill set and cemented him as a world class footballer

I agree, that the personalities of the cast weren't exactly the same as in the original, and the subject matter was sometimes a bit over the top, but I can't really understand all the hatred it gets.

I suspect that there might be some nostalgic inflation in play here. I've watched the original series for the first time this spring, and found out about the new season a few month later, so I don't have 30 years of fond memories to influence my assessment.

Honestly, if you look at many of the old classic comedy series (Father Ted, Yes, Minister, Blackadder, Fawlty Towers, ...) in a modern setting, they are certainly fun and witty. But there is also plenty of ridiculousness in them.

I can speak to their relevance in their respective times though. (After all Citizen Kane is nowadays considered a dreadful bore by many, but was revolutionary in its time) 

So the question is what you expect: Do you want to get a mostly faithful adaptation of the old format, with the old setting, flow and humour? Or do you want a spiritual successor which is as revolutionary as the original was when it first began?

The former might seem dull and uninspired in the light of all the TV that happened in the last 30 years, while the later might as well be an independent series in a new setting.",0,1404870309,null,0,false,0,cis64d5,t3_2a587f,t1_cis64d5,t1_cis3jj6,null,1434618959,3,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,3

true,jgms,newcr-1,"Kompany, Hummels, Silva, Stones.","&gt;  One goal, every other game. That's what I want. I'm not sure he has it

Lukaku has played 2 seasons in the Premier League, his first season with West Brom he scored 17 goals in 35 games.

For us last season in 29 starts (and 2 sub appearances) he scored 15. That's pretty much an average of 1 in 2. And that was after missing the first month of the season and missing another month through injury. I think in a full season with us he could have scored 20 goals easily, which is terrific, and not bad return for 24m or whatever the quoted fee is. That is just proof of his ability now and he is only 21, with a few more years growing with the team under Roberto's tutelage he will only improve, and if we were to sell him in a few years for whatever reason, he will always command a high price in the transfer market. 

Another poster here said it the other day, all good teams need a striker who will get you 20+ goals a season bar Chelsea who have a 100m midfield. It's rare that we get a chance to sign a striker of Lukaku's ability not to mention potential and for us to pass up the opportunity seems daft the more I think about it. 

I don't think that the fee is too outrageous, we paid 11m for Yakubu 7 years ago and 15m for Fellaini 6 years ago. If we have Lukaku on board then I think that we will surely be able to negotiate a deal with Chelsea with payments over a few years. New TV deals are lucrative so I think its possible.

So why Scolari called him? He isn't even young anymore, his glory days are long behind.

Well, I don't know. I just don't want to see people outside Brazil thinking he is an awful player. He played for my team (Cruzeiro) and made his name here.

edit: By the way, this game today was in my city. And it was funny because we don't have a significant germany population here, but there was lots of fireworks. People wasn't amused with our national team.

I don't see any racism in your words. Your history sucks though. 

&gt; The normans practically were us

Not at the time, they descended from Vikings

&gt; WE WERE NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT EITHER!!

This is where you're misunderstanding history, there is no ""original british peoples"". We are Celt, Norman, Viking, French, Indian, West Indies, South Africa, Hong Kong, Rhodesia, Malaysia, Pakistan. We are the commonwealth which is the continuation of our great mixing of peoples.  

We've assimilated many cultures from across the globe into our heritage and I don't buy suddenly choking on Islam. We've assimilated Hindus, Sikhs, Jews (although often poorly in the past), people of all religions as well Muslims.  
That's right, Muslims. We've had Muslims from Pakistan coming over here since the 1950's. Remember 1991? That was alright, wasn't it? We had almost 500,000 Pakistanis in Britain in 1991. How many of those do you think are still really Muslim? They're British, they're secular because that's how we roll, that's partly why some of them wanted to come here.

&gt; they weren't here to install Islamic views!

and here's where we agree. I sure as hell ain't letting anyone install Sharia Law in this country any time soon, we'll never accept that as a nation.  

&gt; I never hear about Chinese problems here

Its not their individual citizens you have to worry about. They're often politically impotent so are not very troublesome.  
There's decent reason why the middle east are pissed at us, I'd figure any Arab kid that reads into their past might have a bone to pick with the British, especially if they're young and rebellious. Then feed that kid some bullshit conspiracy theory bullshit about the British and give them a bomb and there you go.

true,nomalas,null,null,"So if he hadn't missed a couple clear cut chances, I would say he was all around excellent. Some might say he was invisible or looked tired, but consider the midfield he had to work with all tournament. Neymar is obviously brilliant and links up well with Oscar, but who else does he have to work with? Look at Scolaris mid from today: Rosa/ Gustavo, Hulk/Oscar/Bernard, Fred-- I'll just remove Fred immediately to save time. Fernandinho is quality but can't do much in the form of link-up play. Gustavo is in the same boat as Fernandinho. Hulk is pretty much the equivalent of a black hole--passing him the ball results in the loss of possession or a shot (which is usually wayward). Bernard is probably even worse than Hulk in most ways and pretty much gave the ball away every time he had it. 

That really leaves Oscar as the one player to glue it all together. Brazil was setup to counter with toughtackling mids supplying the ball to Oscar who could then distribute to pacey wingers. This didn't really happen as we all know and Oscar had to watch as Luiz and co booted the ball forward. If you rewatch the game, you will notice that the defenders booted the ball forward so often because they had no outlets--Rosa/Gustavo couldn't posses the ball at all and were honestly scared to receive it by the end. I watched Fernandinho pretty much avoiding his defenders after he gave up that one ball for Germany's super quick fourth.

Oscar ended up coming all the way back to the defense to receive the ball so he could make something happen, only to get the ball, face forward and see Hulk/Bernard 50 yards away or Fred sitting down licking the pitch for some reason. Oscar without Neymar was completely hopeless--he had absolutely no one to link up with. When he did have Neymar he was inconsistent as well, but I still feel it was more the midfield as a whole causing his role to be marginalized. All that being said, Oscar was the only Brazilian out there who looked he could do anything (though Ramirez was playing pretty well), but was completely overrun by Germany and fucked by Scolari",0,1404877006,null,0,1404877850,0,cis937j,t3_2a6kyo,t1_cis937j,t1_cis0s8i,null,1434620670,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

The whole team was culpable, but Fernandinho was a part of it and his individual performance was the poorest I've seen of him.

I've been banging the drum for him relentlessly, and thought he was a very good shout for man of the match against Columbia, but he was very poor tonight.

He seemed to be cowered by the responsibility to be the more positive of the two central midfielders while Gustavo held. He was reluctant to receive the ball and didn't offer himself as an option to receive the ball enough. That's not so surprising however given how effectively the Germans were pressing in midfield, it was a burly and aggressive engine room and Fernandinho struggled with it. On one of the few occasions he offered himself for a pass, he was dispossessed and Germany scored to make it 4 nil IIRC. He appeared laboured, and lacked his usual energy. For another of the goals Fernandinho failed to intercept a crossfield pass outside the area which lead to a goal. 

One of the most damning from a collective perspective was when Hummels carried the ball out of Germany's defence and just strolled through Brasil's midfield (and Fernandinho), evaded a pathetic tackle from Luiz who had rushed out of his postion and exposed his defence, and laid off a pass and another goal. 

The whole team lacked discipline, and crumbled after conceding the intial goal from shocking defending at the corner.

They just seemed to capitulate, like the pressure was just too much to bear. They lost their heads and played erratically and without any tactical nous or awareness of the threat Germany posed.

And given how well Germany played and the strength of their midfield - it was a massacre.

I have genuinely never seen anything like that in my life. At this level, and between two teams which should be competitive.

It's just astonishing. Staggering.

There were some terrible individual performances from Brasilian players, and Fernandinho was one of them, but there is a lot to be said for the naivety from a tactical standpoint and Scolari has to take responsibility for that.

Germany have a 3 man central midfield with power and technique, a 2 man central midfield of Fernandinho and Gustavo would always be vulnerable.

Particularly if there is not enough pressure on the ball, and the attacking players don't contribute enough defensively.

I just can't compute what I saw tonight.

Brasil played with their hearts, and not their heads. At times they were gung-ho, throwing men forward, showing staggering disregard for the threat Germany posed on the counter.

I just really hope this night doesn't have a lasting effect on Fernandinho's confidence or his game, this was the biggest game of his life and it will go down in notoriety in Brasilian and World Cup history.

Real Madrid only have Khedira, Illaramendi, Casemiro and Xabi that can play in the defensive midfield. Casemiro is still very raw and far from starting. Xabi is getting old, which is why they purchased Illaramendi and sold Sahin back to Dortmund (who was his initial replacement, but it didn't work out). What doesn't make sense is why they would buy Kroos and sell Khedira? 

Kroos would be competing with Modric, and Di Maria for a center mid spot much more than he would be with Khedira. Khedira would occasionally play in a box-to-box position obviously with Xabi behind some times in a season but he would be playing as the defensive mid mostly.

If Real Madrid sold Di Maria and then purchased Kroos it would essentially be a like for like switch and would keep the team balance. But if they sell Khedira they are only weakening themselves needlessly so unless Khedira himself is pushing for the transfer, (which is highly unlikely because Carlo loves him, he has very little competition for his spot and his german buddy Kroos is coming) than I am pretty sure this is just transfer news rubbish.

Unlike in other countries, there are strong expectations about how we dress in the UK. We wear different clothes to fit in in all sorts of different environments. Every day I wake up and ask myself what clothes would be appropriate for me to wear.

And while we do have a belief in tolerance, the other side of the politeness coin is that we try to cause others as little discomfort as possible.

No one has to wear a niqab--it's basically not a religious requirement--so I don't see any qualms in suggesting people try to wear it sensitively if they want to wear it at all.

None of this is to condone the attacks. The same point about causing others discomfort also holds. Abuse of this kind is unequivocally disgusting. But we also need to understand where it comes from if we want it to end.

Islam is not understood by huge numbers of people in the UK. We shouldn't pretend otherwise. If we seriously want integration people should present Islam in ways which are non-threatening and in which others can find as little as possible to reject. There is lots to respect in Islam but those points are not obvious to many people and efforts need to be made for mutual understanding.

Having Suarez on the team often times took the attention of defenders away from him.
With the flat 4-3-3 that Rodgers prefers, the front 6 should all be very fluid and help defend as well.
Watch and see. Sturridge is not going to have another stellar season since he will be the main focus for all defenders.

This is more privitisation. By making the patients responsible for the budget, the NHS can't be blamed when it won't stretch far enough. This is a lot worse than people realise as they've essentially passed the responsibility for care onto a sick person. They may be neither mentally able to make the right decisions nor adept enough to understand their own needs:

""Frail elderly people, disabled children and those with serious mental illness or learning disabilities""

Rather than improving the system in order to provide better care - they're passing the buck. This is a HUGE cop-out.

Edit: If that wasn't chilling enough, the parting comment in the article should frighten people:

""Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary, welcomed the plan.

Despite your lack of qualifications, make sure you present a well thought out CV. Convey your enthusiasm, determination, team-working ability etc - the general buzzwords. Try and describe yourself as a person (what makes you special, hobbies, ambitions etc) and why that business would want to employ you. You need to ask why you would employ yourself and put this on your CV.   

  
Secondly, a little story. When i turned 16 my father made me print of 20 CVs that i had made and one day he took me into my local town and drove me around loads of companies and made me hand in CVs to them. Some of these places didn't have a job, but i still left my CV. It was incredibly embarrassing and challenging to 16 year old me however, it showed determination and grit. Not only that, in the end i managed to get a job. Admittedly at this stage i had scottish standard-grades qualifications but my job experience was zero apart from paper delivery. People admire tenacity and personally delivering a CV shows this.


So to that effect, get your CV up to scratch - get people to review it and improve it. Then print off 20 copies, and walk into almost every damn place to see if they are hiring. It will be difficult, it will be embarrassing perhaps, but the worst response you can get is 'no'. Eventually someone will take you on. Walking in and asking to speak to the manager to hand in a CV is much more impressive than filling in an online application form - consider it as the first interview to show your personality and why they should call you back.",0,1404889964,null,0,false,0,cisddrb,t3_2a70iv,t1_cisddrb,t3_2a70iv,null,1434622570,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Regarding his defensive duties, I don't think he should be doing much except pressing opposing CB's every now and then to keep them on their toes, and pounce on any mistakes. I believe the wider players of the front 3 should be doing most of the ""defensive duties"".

We knew they were never going to go grander, we knew that after Simon's time travelling stuff was summed up and forgotten. So the idea of them deciding to do something bigger post-series was completely fine with me. It was just a bad episode, with as you said, poor plot points and unjustifiable characters actions that just seemed off.

The creepy time travel guy was cringe inducing. The 'superheroes' just deciding to start killing people, the time travel wasn't a plausible excuse to backflip characters.

They could simply have their own chargers at security check. Most android phones use the same plug, while there are only 2 plug types for modern iphones.

Things get more complicated with laptops, but still - most common portable laptops use the same voltage 18 - 19.5V with about 6 different plugs, so simple ""universal power adapter"" would solve this problem for 90% of laptops.

They've been incredibly successful, and for 2008-2012 were pretty much the team to beat in club football. But they absolutely weren't any more dominant than other clubs have been in the past - domestically three league titles out of four and one domestic cup out of four is hardly a clean sweep - they only took half of the trophies they could have won - and it's definitely not ""destroying the competition"". Two Champions League titles is probably the most impressive aspect, and is the only reason I wouldn't bother to argue that, say, Manchester United in the late 90s or even mid 2000s were more dominant. All of the other tournaments, the super cups and the World Club Champions are, as I said in an earlier post, competitions where qualifying for them as the more successful club is more difficult than actually winning them once you're there. 

All I'm saying is that the guy is making out like Barca have had some kind of success that no other team has seen before in Europe (he's literally said that), which is nonsense. Winning your league three times and the Champions League twice in a four year period years is impressive, but Ajax, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, AC Milan, Inter Milan and Real Madrid have all achieved that before - with Ajax, Bayern and RM winning the European Cup more than just twice.

Barca have been very successful, and I'd be retarded to claim otherwise, but they haven't been successful to any kind of unprecedented level that hasn't been achieved multiple times before by other clubs through history, and the sentiment that they have somehow been more dominant than any other club ever is all I'm arguing against. They were undeniably the best club from 2008-2012, and one of the best club sides ever, but that doesn't make them *the* best club side ever, which is what that guy seemed to be claiming and then actually went on to claim.

And I find it kind of amusing given the OP how much I can get jumped on for going against the notion that Barcelona with Messi were by far the greatest team ever to grace history, when in actual fact plenty of other teams have dominated harder and for longer periods in the past.

As soon as Silva was out and the hapless Dante was drafted in, to form possibly the worst CB pairing ever seen in a World Cup semi-final, the writing was on the wall. Luiz charging about like Sideshow Bob on PCP was always going to be exploited by the clinical Germans.

It was joyous to watch, really. The Brazil team didn't really make any friends with their incessant fouling (Fernandinho in particular should have been sent off about three times) and Germany were majestic.

Kroos looks top, top quality and Bayern will miss him. Khedira and Swcheinsteiger owned midfield.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;you're talking about the hijab, which technically is a wider term describing all muslim dress

I'm talking about all dress which makes it difficult for the wearer to interact with society, niqab, burqa ect.

&gt;What disadvantages would a burqa have for the wearer? 

If the face is covered it cuts them off from people around them, makes them less approachable and less easy to interact with, as facial expressions are a huge factor in how we read and understand people, and so form relationships. It prevents them from forming relationships with anyone that their family does not approve of. 

On a cultural level, it separates the wearer from the rest of society. It changes the way they have to behave around other people, and so makes it much harder for them to integrate into society.

&gt;it is not simply a means to an end; rather, it can signify a devout faith.

Which is what I meant when I said it wasn't just reasons of modesty that the dress is encouraged. It is a tool of religion, and the reality is the reason most people encourage it is that they do not see women as equal to men, not necessarily out of spite, but because of a strong religious belief. However, most people would agree that those view run counter to the values of people in this country, and so should be discouraged.

Your jobcentre should also have a load of different courses on offer, such as part time GCSEs you can do while you hunt for stuff.

I am proud of being an Englishman, and whilst I might make the odd joke about the French (which is just part of English/French neighbourly camaraderie), I do not think less of other cultures, races or creeds. In fact, I am constantly amazed by how much we can learn about ourselves and the diversity of life just by looking out into the World. The Little Englander does not look out, and they resent when they look in and see the influences of empire past (Indian and West Indian refugees enrage them).

The Little Englander assumes all ""foreigners"" on these shores are suspect, even if they were born here - simply not fitting their narrow-minded ideal of Englishness is enough to make them a lesser person. 

Black? Asian? The Little Englander is wary. Jewish? You will be treated with polite caution. Muslim? Oh dear, this isn't going to be pleasant...

The Little Englander believes that we are mighty and therefore others want something from us, and we must protect ourselves from it - we should keep ourselves to ourselves and remain a little England. They believe that ""our values"" are at risk of corruption, ignorant that those very values themselves are a product of endless corruption over millennia from the Celts, the Romans, the Angles, the Vikings, the Normans...

I, as simply a proud Englishman, think we have a responsibility as a modern democracy that has chosen a path of supporting justice, equality and tolerance, to go out into the World and protect victims from those who oppose those things. 

The last few hundred years our chosen strategies with regards to forieng lands have relied heavily on warfare and trade sanctions. I would choose a future strategy rooted in education and economic investment.

The Little Englander would let them all rot. The Little Englander does not care if a girl in Afghanistan goes to school or not - that is an issue for the Afghans.

If I say we get the full 80M from Suarez we have 66M left to spend, obviously we do not expect Markovic to replicate Suarez so one more big addition to our strike force is expected which will cost upwards of 25M unless we expect Sturridge to fill the void but I still have doubts over his consistency. I think everyone would agree we need at least one player for our defence, apparently we're after Lovren and had a 20M bid rejected so we're willing to spend 20M on a new defender so that's 46M left to replace the void of Suarez, we lack star quality in our team which just adds to my worries that we will be able to fill the void. 

Arsenal who apparently have 100M have spent 40M of it on Debuchy and Sanchez those signings are going to make a bigger impact than ours imo.

Chelsea have signed Fabregas and Costa for 60M selling David Luiz for 50M, who knows what kind of budget they have.

Man City are already a ridiculous team man for man and they have bought Fernando and are after Mangala to add to their defence.

Manchester United haven't done much, I haven't seen much of Ander Herrera but with LVG and 150M I think they will make a big splash this year and will be keen to rectify their transfer kerfuffle of the previous season

That's 4 teams who I think are poised to do better than us given what I have seen so far, Tottenham are dark horses but I'm not expecting too much from them as they have no history and no star quality. Who knows what kind of jump the team could make maybe Sturridge starts banging in 30 a season and Coutinho or Sterling becomes the next star no.10 or Henderson steps up and becomes a great box to box MF. TBH I only posted this to provoke discussion because it is premature and all this worrying has gotten me excited for the next season.

There are lots of great value venues in and around Bristol, some of them are quite surprising. As JoeyBristol mentioned check out Groupon, you will often see the Clifton Hotels chain on there (No. 4 Clifton, The Square Hotel). These are chic boutique hotels perfect for smaller parties.

Another great venue is Hotel Du Vin in Bristol. They may not have a great deal of outside space (so not perfect for your BBQ) but their room hire is somewhere around £400-£500 and you're in a beautiful setting.

Goldbrick House on Park Street is great for a smaller weddings. I've photographed weddings there before with 20 people, again though they recently converted their outdoor terrace so it's now part of the indoors, so no outside BBQ space.

The Glassboat is another great / unusual venue. I think they have a minimum spend of around £1000 but the hire of the room is free (or it was a couple of years ago!). 

Blaise Castle was also quite affordable to hire, apparently, and if you wanted something kinda hip The Paintworks is quite reasonably priced.

The most useful resource is probably the Bristol council website which has a list of approved venues for marriages: http://www.bristol.gov.uk/page/births-deaths-and-marriages/approved-venues-marriages-and-civil-partnerships. 

Now for a bit of shameless self promotion: If you want wedding photography our website ([www.west70.co.uk](http://www.west70.co.uk)) should have you covered.

forget about origi for now, and look at markovic, anybody who has seen him play will tell you we have a player on our hands. if things work out for him, along with coutinho, sterling and sturridge, we have 4 potentially world class players. you need to give more credit to the team we have and how well they worked last season.

we need to replace suarez's impact on our play rather than outright replace him and if we do that whilst improving our defence, we will do just fine.

We could go for a loan signing, but they only tend to become available later in the window and then you're playing a very dangerous game, taking a risk that you will be left with nothing.


You also have to face the harsh reality that if Villa can bring in Bendtner on the same money as Cole/Senderos, whilst selling Darren Bent, that will knock 40-50k/week off the wage bill. Even with our improved financial situation we are still paying our squad a LOT more than they are worth. It is attractive to Lerner to continue to reduce our annual spending where he can. And presumably also attractive to Lambert, if he can free up some wage budget to make 1-2 signings in another position.

true,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"I, too, agree that MP's wages should be significantly increased.

I also think their expenses should be rapidly decreased.

I think MPs shouldn't be allowed a second home on expenses unless they live outside of a commuter's distance from London (i.e. outside of the area normal every day people have to commute). 

If they do live a great distance from London, then they shouldn't ""own"" their second home. They should be helped to get one by government funds, and then at the end of their time as an MP, they provide the house back to the government. These homes can either be sold for a profit (thus funding future homes for MPs) or simply transferred to new MPs.

I think it's right they should be able to claim for transport while working, but not for food as they would need to pay for food anyway. The exception to this is if they are dining with someone while on official business. 

In this way we may actually make being an MP both attractive and well paid enough to attract a wide variety of talent while ensuring no-one can simply just ride the gravy boat. 

Oh also there should be a mail drop either once a year or prior to the election that tells you:

1) How much your MP was paid (i.e. their salary)

2) How much your MP claimed in expenses (and which categories it was in e.g. housing, food, travel)

3) How many votes your MP attended at the House of Commons

4) How many staff they have working in their London and constituency offices (seperate figures)

5) How many cases have been worked by their constituency office during the year

6) Any formal positions they held during the time frame (e.g. PPS, Ministers, Committee Chair)

7) Where you can find information showing you how they voted on every vote they attended, the MP's own website and contact details etc.

That way it's more like an actual performance review where an MP has to explain their actions over the year.

Its not my view,  [its the view of the majority of people in this country.] (http://yougov.co.uk/news/2013/09/18/most-still-want-ban-burka-britain/) Most people feel that the burka cuts the wearer off from society and makes it harder to communicate. As I've already said, it makes reading facial expressions impossible, which is a big part of understanding a persons intentions and forming relationships. Its not simply a case of people feeling intimidated about approaching someone dressed that way, there are real psychological reasons why it is difficult to communicate with someone in that dress. Its not a benign cultural choice, it has real negative effects on the wearer and society.

 I've made these points several times and you are yet to acknowledge them or tell me why I'm wrong. You are ignoring the real negative effects.

There's already a website where you can find most of that information, it's not a secret.

I think we need to realise people generally aren't engaged with politics so you have to bring it to them. If you put 30million leaflets through letter boxes of homes, more people will be aware of what their MP has actually been doing, even if it's only an extra million or so people, it's worth it. 

EDIT: I realise you mean centralise location for MPs not the info doh!

Point is that marshalling them all into one place probably is very efficient. You'd have to buy a large plot of land and have a building that can hold theoretically 600+ rooms. As all the MPs would be in the same place you'd need maximum security, probably the same as the house of commons itself. All this within a reasonable distance of Westminster too otherwise it's another security risk. This would all be very expensive.

If they are scattered all over London, you can just let them choose the house they want for the money available and get on with it and when they lose their role they give up the house (or buy it from the government I guess).",0,1404901821,null,0,1404902442,0,cisfmsd,t3_2a851k,t1_cisfmsd,t1_cisflrq,null,1434623748,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I agree I think that Sturridge will step up but I am concerned over his recent injury history. One unlucky moment and that might well be our season over unless we can sign another proven striker. 

I am glad we are getting rid of Suarez. I don't think he really feels for Liverpool and there is no point keeping him considering he is banned for 1/4 of the season. 

I am excited for next season but I do think we need to look to sign some more quality. I think United will be back next season and I don't buy into this 3/4 years of mediocrity. Chelsea and City are guaranteed Top 2/3 IMHO so I think that leaves the rest of us fighting for the other two spots. United and Arsenal are the most troublesome but don't count out Spurs and Everton with another season behind them. As last season showed, anything can happen. 

Looking forward to the World Cup Final. Never really been into international football but this Germany team are really something.

Even last season where everything went our way we still managed to lose the title. I told myself I couldn't get excited until after the Chelsea game which proved to be a good decision. 

I am nervous about Arsenal. I think they have a good team and they under-performed last season. If they can keep Ramsey fit and they sign a couple more players anything can happen. Their FA Cup win has finally  got that massive monkey off their back and psychologically it will make a big difference. They have been mentally weak in the past but who knows now?

&gt;Detectives later linked Wilson to a call made to them a month later warning that the Northumbria Police website was going to be attacked. 

&gt;The attack lasted for eight minutes and the website began to slow down before being taken down as a precaution for four minutes.

&gt;Wilson was arrested in January last year and admitted making the call but claimed he was just warning them of a possible attack by someone else.

&gt;**Police then uncovered other messages he had sent from his Skype phone which included him saying, 'gonna (sic) go harass some police stations' and 'Let's troll Newcastle police department'.**

&gt;He also encouraged others to report a hoax mugging outside Newcastle's Centre for Life.

&gt;Wilson also discussed hacking into the university network and getting passwords for 50 other students, the court heard.

&gt;**When his phone was examined, police found references to him carrying out another online attack on the Serious Organised Crime Agency and trolling a police memorial page.**

&gt;David Lister, defending, said: 'He has expressed genuine remorse, he bitterly regrets his actions.

&gt;'He was 19 at the time and the impact of his Autism Spectrum Disorder or Asperger's meant he matured more slowly than others.'

Such implied guilt, surely an innocent man who was just jesting on the multiple occassions he claimed to commit these crimes, and an unfortunate coincidence that he would not allow police to decrypt his computer which surely would have proved his innocence.

You are innocent until proven guilty. However a jury can and will infer guilt if you do not provide an account of your innocence when given an opportunity to do so. He had evidence against him on his phone, his computer could have proved his innocence, he chose not to allow the police access and ended up with a prison sentence.",0,1404903828,null,0,false,0,cisg0co,t3_2a5a0b,t1_cisg0co,t1_cirnyro,null,1434623971,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

You're allowed to refuse service to someone if serving them would harm your business. For example, you can't refuse to serve someone who has a kid with autism but you can if the kid is shouting and your other customers complain. 

It's the same concept with employment. The case I was given during HR training was an english teacher tutoring ESL kids. She became more into her faith and started wearing a niqab and was fired for this. This was deemed non-discriminatory as it had a profound effect on children, whereas it would have been discriminatory if they fired her for being Muslim. Interestingly, refusing to give a job to a candidate because they were ""too experienced"" was deemed age discrimination.

There are always a huge amount of edge cases, but the core idea is that you can do what you want if it has an actual effect on your business.

The irresponsibility, in this day and age, to exploit religious differences where none exist, is at the very least negligent and more appropriately dangerous. We have family members all over the world, and the idea that someone would **inflame any part of that world for the sole reason of selling papers should be criminal**.

Looking through the rest of the article it is hard to see what actual danger anybody was put in as a result of the Mail's alleged fabrication, aside from this:

&gt; It says Amal's mother has been telling 'half of Beirut' that she's against the wedding. It says they joke about traditions in the Druze religion that end up with the death of the bride. Let me repeat that: the death of the bride.""

The use of the word joke here seems pretty ambiguous. My suspicion would be that Clooney is pissed off at the Mail but realises the publishing of false information is not in itself an offence. So he has alleged it has caused his family to fear for their safety. No doubt the Mail's critics will accept this at face value, but I find it dubious. 

And however agreeable his suggestion of a new criminal offence sounds, in the majority of cases it would be very difficult to link the behaviour of any individual to a newspaper article.

true,KaiTGR,lfc99,,"What i've gathered from this world cup is that we have a fucking genius as manager. 

Firstly our prefered formation 4-3-3 without a destroyer but with a deep lying playmaker seems to really catch on in world football. France played with Cabaye as DLP and two box to box runners in pogba and matuidi. Yesterday we (germany) played the first time with a DPL (Schweini) and two runners in Khedira and Kroos (well, considering his speed more like a walker) and it's safe to say it was successfull. Even Real Madrid sort of played like this whenever they had all their midfielders fit. 

Juventus is said to be switching to exactly this system too. Although their 3-5-2 system ensured their total domination over Serie A in these last few years.

The great thing about this is that you don't need that one world class striker in such a team. The collective pressing and trained movement makes it such a great tactic. 

The only thing i'm slightly worried about for next season is where to put Couts. Take Germany's NT for example, our beloved scapegoat Özil is our most creative player by far (when in form) and he's got no tracking back duty most of the time because Höwedes, a trained cb, shuts down the left flank by himself most of the time. We don't have that type of player in our defense. So Couts will probably play in the midfield trio but there he could be a little to lightweight against some teams in the CL. 

Long story short: I'm fucking excited to see what we can achieve next season. I'm not expecting another title challenge but i'll think we'll cope without Suárez and probably finish around 3rd/4th. That would be fine with me.

Um. No? Islam is not aggressive towards Christianity here. The most aggression against Christianity in the UK is from..... Christianity. I'm thinking Northern Ireland or Scotland.  

&gt; Your idea of assimulation is mislead.

No, I mean they become us. Secular, beer drinking, laugh having. Maybe not the original ones but their children do.  

&gt; They're British, they're secular because that's how we roll

We're presently one of the most secular countries in the world.

&gt; if your going to be secular then why don't you do that in Pakistan?

Because its more tricky there. Better to come here where its easy to be secular.

&gt; but my ancestry is English, not Pakistani.. or anything else.

your ancestry is that list of countries I gave you. You're a mix of that. Not the commonwealth just yet but in 200 years it will harder to define the difference.  

&gt; EXACTLEY YOU HIT THE NAIL RIGHT ON THE FUCKING HEAD! do i want a Arab living in my street with a fucking bomb and a nasty attitude to my country... come on.. think about it!

You mis-understand. Its radical youth that is the issue, not the religion. You could just as easily be killed by a Christian nutjob (Brevik) or someone heavily into anti-globalisation, or any other form of extremism.  

&gt; France just doesn't like muslims coming into their country and fucking the place up!  

No, they're just shit at integrating them. They passed a law to stop them wearing hats. They're bad. I'd go into more detail (because France's issues are quite interesting) but its too much of a tangent.  

&gt; Multiculturalism doesn't work...

Sure it does. We have a capital city bursting with all sorts of people. Still works!  

&gt; look at Palestine.. there's been fighting their for 100's of years.

yeah, that's the opposite of multi-culturalism. There is even a wall. Palestinians on one side, Jews the other.

&gt; Islam is not compatible with any-other religion? perhaps Islam is the problem!

Read up on the Ottoman Empire. They're the Muslims that took in the Jews and accepted them when the Christians threw them out in the Middle Ages. The problem isn't a religious one, its a political one. A lot of Islamic countries have political issues and often those issues were created by external forces.  
You'd be right in regards to really extreme forms of Islam like the Taliban but most forms of Islam are much more permissive. There are Churches in most Islamic countries and if you didn't know The Holy Bible is actually part of the reading materials for Islam. They accept that Jesus was a prophet, they just don't think he was the messiah.

Again this is a flawed study, every single time the issue comes up there's a significant problem with the method and the conclusion:

They are looking at change over time and asking if immigration has correlated effects with other things, and then making a conclusion based on that.

This seems reasonable, but they fail to account for the dozens of other changes that happen in that time (policy change, law changes, economy changes), because ultimately immigration does not happen in a vacuum.

Here's a situation we're all familiar with: a shop puts up promotional material for their christmas trading period. Sales went up over christmas. Conclusion: promotional material in the window boosted sales. In reality, it's Christmas trading that boosted sales, because the promotional material didn't happen in a vacuum. It might have had a positive effect, a negative effect, or no effect, but you can't draw that conclusion without further analysis.

Immigration doesn't happen in a vacuum, over the last 20 years there have been dozens of factors that will have affected employment, crime, housing, hospitals, schools etc. probably moreso than any affect from immigration.

These changes aren't 'factored in' to the data (they are simply taking top line figures over time) so crowd out any analysis on immigration itself.

*This does not mean immigration has no effect.*

Then again, it's easy to poo-poo any study. I just wish that they were more up front about the fact that these studies are basically looking at what is happening, rather than trying to answer the question 'what would have happened with less or more immigration'.

Ways I would suggest doing this:

* compare similar countries with different immigration policies over time
* compare similar areas of the same countries with different levels of immigration over time
* more technical, but you can in theory 'divide out' larger effects if they have been quantified already. (In the shop example, if you know that christmas sales are 3x weekly non-christmas sales, you could index the success of the promo material against 3x your regular weekly sales)",0,1404905542,null,0,false,0,cisgcyw,t3_2a6mwg,t1_cisgcyw,t3_2a6mwg,null,1434624161,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

A food allowance while travelling on work is fairly standard practice, having to get food on the go is more expensive than eating at home and if you are travelling on work you deserve to be able to grab a half decent meal quickly, ours is £10 for lunch and £20 for dinner (no booze) and they only kick in if you have been travelling for a certain length of time.

Certainly I would no thave believed that you couldn't read just four years ago from what you have written so far if you hadn't said so yourself. That is quite an achievement, so well done to you for that.

As for work and lack of education, most employers at the sort of level you are looking at will be more interested in your work ethic and enthusiasm rather than qualifications. Qualifications will help you apply for higher paid future work though, so don't dimiss them just because they won't make too much difference to you getting a job now. 

Do some Google searching on how to best draft a CV without qualifications. You can start with this (which might be helpful):

&gt;

&gt;The __Malayan Emergency__ ([Malay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language): *Darurat*; [Jawi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawi_script): __ضرورت__) was a [Malayan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_Malaya) [guerrilla war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare) fought between [Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) armed forces and the [Malayan National Liberation Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayan_Races_Liberation_Army) (MNLA), the military arm of the [Malayan Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayan_Communist_Party) (MCP), from 1948 to 1960.

&gt;The *Malayan Emergency* was the colonial government's term for the conflict. The MNLA termed it the *Anti-British National Liberation War*.  The rubber plantations and tin mining industries had pushed for the use of the term ""emergency"" since their losses would not have been covered by [Lloyd's insurers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd%27s_of_London) if it had been termed a ""war"". 

&gt;Despite the communists' defeat in 1960, communist leader [Chin Peng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chin_Peng) renewed the insurgency in 1967; it lasted until 1989, and became known as the [Communist Insurgency War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Insurgency_War). Although Australian and British armed forces had fully withdrawn from Malaya (by then known as [Peninsular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsular_Malaysia) [Malaysia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia)) years earlier, the insurgency still failed.

My thoughts are that the problems facing Britain would be much better addressed by:

* Banning foreign investment in property

* Moving tax-paid and governmental jobs away from London on a large scale and creating further economic incentives that make the rest of the country more attractive to live. The BBC should not have kept it's main operations in central London. Not just for this reason but because our license fees would go further and we'd get better quality TV. Making another city in the North the administrative capital would quickly remove a lot of pressure as well as the sale of central London property benefiting the treasury.

* Making things easier for planners and builders of smaller housing developments. In other countries like NZ, Canada and Australia it's rarer to see houses go up in UK style estates outside of brownfield sites. Way more development is done one or two houses at a time by small independent builders rather than these big companies with shareholders. Big estates transforming the countryside in one fell swoop up the stakes for everyone involved. 
In these other countries there's also a lot more consolidation of existing property when values go up than happens in the UK too, as in it's a lot easier to get permission to build another house on your property if there is room.

Markovic scores very few and will need to develop this part of his game if he comes.

Sturridge over the 20 mark.

Lambert 10-15.

These are all best case scenario.

People generally live to limit of their financial capbility and people earning £100,000 will generally have friends and associates that also earn £100,000. Thus most people live in a bubble where they think (or choose to force themselves to believe) that everyone lives by the same means as them.

But then you have to remember that MPs will be spending time with millionaires and billionaires where their piddly little £100,000 would seem embarassingly insignificant. And thus, the insecurity sets in causing paranoia-induced greed.

And then you've also got international comparisons for them to complain about: 'How can we be expected to compete on the world stage when Germany pays their politicians more than us?'.

No matter what you pay, the corrupt and insecure will always remain that way and will *always* want more. Pay rises are not the answer. Trust and respect is the answer. It should be a very prestigious thing to become an MP, but I would be surprised if most people didn't immediately think that if you become a politician you are a corrupt money-grabbing liar.

  I suppose my main concern with him is the tunnel vision he sometimes gets. For example his desire for a hattrick against Everton. It's great to see that kind of drive to improve himself and get himself on the scoresheet and ultimately it didn't matter that game, but what if it did? There's been a few other examples of this, however it's been when he's made a mistake. He seems to get it into his head that he makes a mistake and he has to redeem himself, and so he starts playing a selfish game, trying to take on one man too many.

  It's a fairly minor concern when you have others in the team that can compensate, but I think we're going to see a lot more of this when he's the sole focus point of our attack.

Studge was absent for Suarez's double digit December. and he only scored three goals in nine games when Sturridge returned on Jan 12th and scored in 7 consecutive league games. The two have never really clicked. They were excellent together, sure, but individually each was phenomenal.

Thus, they can't go first in the market until the big clubs make their big moves--they weren't getting those players, anyway, and they (nor their targets) don't know what the price for the 2nd tier of players will be until the big dogs set the top tier valuations.

The only way out of this predicament is to eithertake on a bunch of debt to sign the over-priced top tier, or find players that do not value themselves as highly as Spurs do.  Since any player worth his salt has an agent, this doesn't happen.

Last year was an aberration--the Bale money made us a temporary big club.

Spurs cannot set the market for the top 10 players in the transfer market, because those players, by definition, are over-priced.  You pay 2x-3x more for them for only maybe a 5% increase in production.  (Granted, that 5% can be the difference between trophies and not, but smaller clubs have to make up that gap through other means--either saving money by buying young, or improving output by good management.)",0,1404910438,null,0,false,0,cishm44,t3_2a3flc,t1_cishm44,t1_cis4n3v,null,1434624639,-2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,-2

Silva won the most individually, while Mata had the most goals scored and the highest pass completion.

Ozil, however, ranked 1st in assists per match (so yes, amongst #10s he had the most assists per match played), 2nd in key passes, in chances created, in passes in the final 3rd and pass completion.

Oscar meanwhile, duked it out with Coutinho for last in every category but goal-scoring. Oscar placed last in assists per game (by a HUGE margin), successful passes in the final third, key passes, chances created and 2nd to last in pass accuracy. Abysmal season if we're honest

It's funny that you bag on and on about 42m for Ozil being a ripoff when you all just paid 30+m for a playmaker that generated a whopping 2 assists. That's 1 more than Mikel got in more than double the appearances.

'Expenses' *should* be things that the MP is out of pocket for because they don't have to just do their job in their local constituency, but in London as well.  What we've done is allowed them to lump in a huge amount of other things that normally a company would pay for (eg my company give me a computer - why can't central government give each of them a computer out of their budget).

Personally I wouldn't pay them more money.  £66k for a back bencher puts them at the edge of the top 10% of a full time London worker and the chances are that they'd earn more money after they stop being an MP.

No, we watched the same exact player. He should have been a better leader as you say, but in reality Luiz is not captain material. He is never going to be able to give more leadership than just playing his heart out and leading by example. He can't offer defensive rigidity or maintain a tightly drilled formation. Luiz needs a player like Silva--like Terry--to anchor him and everyone knows this. Well everyone except Scolari.

&gt; Yes Scolari is the most culpable in this defeat, but Luiz did his reputation a lot of damage today

Honestly, if I were PSG, I would still be extremely excited by Luiz by what he has shown this WC. Yes, he was part of a horribly set up team that was completely picked apart by the Germans, but he still showed that he is an immensely talented footballer who just needs someone to anchor him down.

Really quite different, actual facts versus vague assertions. Anyway, personally I don't find the history that interesting, but I do find it interesting that none of his scions have in anyway denounced their ancestor's treason. Though it didn't stop the Mail attacking Milliband's (grand?) dad for a piece written 70 years earlier where he attacked the UK aristocracy for its policy of appeasement.

Secondly, I disagree. The Mail does hate this country and long has. Find me a period of it consistently praising things, show me the period where the line it espoused was ""Wow, things are great"". It hates many ""visions of Britain"" - personally I can't stand these ideological society fantasies, they are all anti-humanity. It loves its fantasy version of Britain, but that place has never and still doesn't exist. It hates the real actual Britain.

Nor do I agree that it represents the socially conservative view of Britain - I'd suggest the Times is better positioned at that and the Mail/Times absolutely do not agree with each other. The Mail represents a hierarchical view of Britain under a strengthened monarchy, a wealthy self-determined elite, a servile underclass and a government controlled &amp; dictated morality. Many Tories (e.g. the Sun/Times set) are actually deeply opposed to this vision - and Murdoch absolutely hates the elitist Mail.

EDIT: Just for the record, the primary reason I hate the Mail is nothing to do with politics. It's the unconscionably unethical health reporting, from the astroturfing through to the promotion of dangerous therapies, without the slightest concern about the safety of its readers or the impact of politicking on public health. The fact they behave like that ***and then try to take the moral high ground***, yeah, fucking hypocrites.

&gt;Let's just forget for a moment that this new power is supposed to be about 'naughty' people who don't pay their taxes, and consider what's really being proposed - or rather, actually happening.
Your bank enters into contract with you to act as holder of your wealth, that is, monies or financial instruments that you own and hold via trust in contract with another private party. That relationship is fully defined in the contract, with rights and legally enforceable responsibilities - on both sides. This is common law, in its purest sense, that Magna Carta condenses into two pages of vellum of inalienable rights (which are, amongst others) - the right of freedom of the person from summary arrest and incarceration and the unalloyed title to legally held property.

&gt;Your relationship with the state or sovereign authority is an entirely separate and blind relationship to any other (or should be) - and it has been for the best part of a thousand years. 
This 'minor' adjustment to tax collecting powers, if left unchallenged, changes all that. 
Private property, indeed the very concept, principle, practice and legal shroud protecting it - goes. 
Private property then becomes merely a gift and whim of the state. This is a very serious thing indeed and underpins our very ability to exist as independent actors, separate from the state.",0,1404912095,null,0,1404913642,0,cisi62z,t3_2a8isk,t1_cisi62z,t3_2a8isk,null,1434624912,30,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,30

&gt;Finding myself in a pub in London’s East End, I had struck up conversation with an aging pop star who was offended by the crucifix lapel badge that I was wearing. In a bizarre inversion of one of those old Dracula films, he pulled a pentangle pendent from around his neck and waved it in front of me, as though to ward off the power of my Christian presence. He informed me that the pentangle was not a symbol of the occult or of black magic but was a pagan symbol. I did not have the patience to explain to him how true pagans, such as Homer or Aristotle, would have been horrified by his wacky and tacky new age dabblings and diabolings. He went on to explain to me that he kept three “sacred” books by his bed, each of which contained important aspects of the truth. One was the Bible, the other Zen Buddhism, and the third Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler! Feeling that there was nothing else to be said, I sidled off into the company of a New York lawyer, now living in London, who was also prompted by the sight of my crucifix to wax lyrical about his own “religion,” which was essentially that there is no God because we are all gods, each one of us.

&gt;Taking my leave from this Godless “god,” I moved on, seeking some relatively sane company. It was not to be. An angry young man, reacting like one possessed by the sight of my crucifix lapel, informed me with malicious intensity that the Catholic Church was corrupt. He asked me whether I had heard of the Illuminati. I told him that indeed I had. He then informed me that the Catholic Church and the Illuminati were the same thing, and that they were part of a sinister conspiracy to enslave humanity. I tried to explain to him that the Illuminati were avowedly anti-Catholic and indeed heretical but he was not interested in hard historical facts or any rational discussion and insisted that the present Pope was a member of this ominous secret societyi. Leaving him to his bizarre beliefs, I shook the “post-Christian” British dust from my feet and longed to return to the relative sanity of South Carolina.",0,1404913381,null,0,false,0,cisimqq,t3_2a8ew0,t1_cisimqq,t3_2a8ew0,null,1434625175,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"What we did all of last season is play with 2 forwards when Sturridge was fit. I don't think Sturridge is as good when he's playing as the lone striker.  He (and the team as a whole) wasn't nearly as threatening when he played alone during Suarez's last ban. He's still amazing, but he is definitely no Suarez. If he really pulls up the slack and goes wild next season then we still need someone to take up his position (Sturridge becomes the focal point, then we'll still be after a second forward... imo Lambert shouldn't be relied upon due to age and he can be great in a bit/part role, and Borini is almost certainly not ready for that responsibility yet).

We are losing a player with that extra spark, the ability to turn a game and force something to happen. We need turbo get someone like that back or we will be flat more often than we should be. Sturridge can be that at times, but he's had more than a few games where he got his goal and looked satisfied. He needs to never be satisfied. We need someone to routinely do it. The top clubs all have this, and we are losing ours.

I also don't know if Sturridge's glass legs will see him through 32 league games next season.  I hope we can sort him out and keep him fit, but we haven't managed that yet in the past 18 months.

Sturridge has all the tools to become absolutely world class, and I hope he makes his mark big this season. But whether he does or not, we will still need a top quality forward to come in because we are losing one.

true,_tpyo,dorset,Dorset,"&gt; other than that it's probably because of the english crusades.. whihc ""escorted"" to the jews to the holy land a few hundred years ago.. 

Your knowledge of history is really odd. You know some things well and others completely not. The crusades go back to the Normans and they're not English at all, they more Italian in that the Pope would rally the troops. Richard the Lionheart is the closest to English you'll get..... except he was Norman/French only visited England I think once and didn't speak any English. ""Cour de Lion"" is probably a better way to talk about him as he's very French (and that's French for the ""heart of the lion"" btw).  
The crusades are a pretty cool topic it was primarily Christian holy war (a.k.a Jihad) but mostly political in nature. The Byzantines had the Muslims on their door and sought assistance. This actually really backfired in the last crusade where the soliders ignored the Muslims and sacked Constantinople instead (modern day Istanbul) which was the capital of the Byzantine Empire and home to Orthodox Christians (the legacy of which is now Russian).  

&gt; however. you're not supposed to go round attacking people in the street. the British people are far away from that of the British government. bombing the london tube won't help.

I totally agree. But its much of a mountain out of a molehill. I see people talk about terrorist attacks but we still only have 7/7 and that was a decade ago? The mentalist who hatched off Rigby's head in the street shouldn't be called a terrorist, its too respectful a term, he was just an utter cunt and complete twat who had a hatchet and no soul. Like the people who mug or con old ladies and beat them up. One of those, the religion doesn't matter they're just twats and unfortunately we always have some. That cunt just used his religion to rationalise his cuntdom in his head.  

&gt; I'm not actually as racist as you think..

I don't think you're racist. If I'm going to be negative at all I'd just suggest you're too easily swayed by media reporting (i.e. IMO they give too much prominence to Muslim stories today making people think its a bigger deal than it actually is), you genuinely have said nothing racist to me.  

&gt; Still works! that's not my friends opinion who has just returned from London after living there for six years... as it happen London has the highest number of racist attacks in England. that doesn't work!

My brother lives there, I know a bunch of people who live there too. People's experiences differ but overall we haven't had a proper race riot since Brixton. There was that one in Tottenham a few years back but that was more general disorder when it spread (its origin was race related but the spread of it wasn't).  

&gt; As for the Jews being accepted by Muslims.. you gotta be joking..

I'm talking about [the past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Ottoman_Empire) as well as the present and trying to put things into a greater perspective. Overall the Muslim faith is very accepting of other religions, there are of course exceptions (The Taliban is a notable one) but there are the same if not more churches in Muslim states then they are Mosques in non-muslim states.  
My overall point is that Islam as a religion is capable of tolerance. The religion isn't the dividing factor, its the level of extremism in particular places and political conflict that fuels terrorism, not the religion they have or the clothes they wear.  

&gt; and to be honest all religion is bullshit anyways

well I totally agree with you there.

&gt; even Islam and Christianity were ""invented"" within a few months of each other...

Actually somewhere between 500 and 700 years depending on who you believe but there is a bit of a gap.

Coutinho can play out wide, but he'll cut in and do the same.

These 2 players, while both excellent attackers, pale in comparison to Sturridge's goalscoring abiltiy.

This is all not to mention that we'll have Lallana in the middle, a far more goalscoring midfielder than Hendo or Allen, which will provide another body for the defense to focus on.
