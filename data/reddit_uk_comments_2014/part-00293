Add in that Israel effectively have a UN veto in the form of the US and we see that unilateral action is unlikely to actually help the situation.

This bad rep you speak of, is basically confined to /r/soccer (a known bunch of wankstains, by and large) a couple of of ex United players (also wankstains) and a few newspapers, for whom it's an easy story. I think most actual football fans in real life aren't that bothered, and are aware that City are, and have been, one of the consistently best supported teams in the league in terms of numbers and attendance. 

Most City fans who already go to matches are well aware that its a great club to be a part of, as you put it. I'm not sure a stadium tour is really going to throw any new light on the matter for them.

Of course the atmosphere is poor despite very good attendance in the league and FA cup, with the exception of a few stands (109-111 I think) and a bit of the South Stand, no one really makes much noise. This has been known for a fair amount of time, it's just that people who don't go to games are now being made aware of it, after the Roma game. Again, going to a stadium tour probably won't help change this. 

I don't have anything to offer as an alternative, I'm afraid. Many people seem happy to sit there in silence all game, which puzzles me, as personally the best thing about going to games is being able to sing and shout.

Losing Suarez and bringing in 9 new players meant that this season was always going to be a difficult one. I mean look at the Everton game. We started **6** new players. Over half of our starting 11 and almost our entire back line has hardly played together.

Doctor Who has always had plausible ideas on its side but we reached a point where the Doctor was becoming stagnant. Over time you get a Flanderized Doctor spewing catch phrases, reversing the polarity, and saving the day.

With Capaldi's Doctor you don't quite know if his plan is going to work or if he even has a plan. He's still The Doctor in that he knows his way around the universe and is incredibly confident. On the other hand, he's quite fallible and his actions are very dependent on those around him. This makes for just enough uncertainty to keep the program interesting.

All of these plastic fans looking for someone to blame. If it isn't Rodgers it is Balotelli or Gerrard. Before that it was Glen Johnson. It isn't one individual. Justified criticism of performances is fine after the match - we learn from it and move on - but these fans want blood.

We had these problems before Rodgers took over but we were blessed with an out-of-this-world player called Suarez who made up for our problems by banging in a load of goals and lifting the morale of the whole team and fans. A player who thrived under Rodgers - just like Studge.


Now, we have fans acting like spoilt little brats. These fans should grow the fuck up or support someone else. It takes time to fix these things. There is nobody I'd rather have at the helm than Brendan Rodgers. Hate ranting but reading some of the comments from 'fans' is almost more annoying than our recent performances. Just embarrassing. 

Look at what players like Gerrard have given to this club - everything. Players who fucking love the club and get shit on. Look at the massive improvements Rodgers brought to our club and how quickly he did it. This how they are repaid? 

I think it is due to the influx of new fans after last season who jumped on the bandwagon due to our exciting attacking style and bounty of goals. These fans are like junkies. Look for their next fix of entertaining play and goals and when they don't get it they take it out their frustrations on anyone they can. Fans who know little about the club or our history. Fuck off you spoilt cunts.

false,whydoyouonlylie,null,null,"(Not that I particularly agree with them on this but here's some reasons.)

1. They think the ECHR's idea on when a person loses certain rights are at odds with the UK's. For example they think the UK's position is that someone who committed a crime serious enough to be sent to jail has forfeited not only their right to free movement, but also their right to involvement in politics, i.e. to vote on the direction of society. The ECHR fundamentally disagrees with the position that a crime that is punishable with a jail term is sufficient to forfeit the right to political involvement, but that it must be particularly heinous to justify long term imprisonment.

2. They believe in the supremacy of parliament. In the UK Parliament has traditionally had ultimate supremacy. It's why we don't have a constitutional court that can overturn legislation. Our courts can only give judgements within the scope of legislation passed in parliament. Even under the HRA the Supreme Court has no authority to overturn any legislation due to incompatibility with ECHR law. The most they can do is advise Parliament that they have found the legislation to be incompatible with ECHR law. It is then for parliament to repeal or amend the legislation or to explicitly give a reason why they would not do so. The ECHR, on the other hand, has the power to force the government to change their legislation due to incompatibility with ECHR law.

3. They disagree with foreign, unelected judges having the power to significantly affect British laws. Judges are nominated by signatories but are not popularly elected yet they have the power to order a government to strike down it's own legislation and the power to sanction them if they refuse.

There's a lot more principled reasons on why they disagree with the ECHR rather than just disagreeing over a set number of specific cases.",0,1412353854,null,0,false,0,ckzgxg5,t3_2i6bqr,t1_ckzgxg5,t1_ckzblr4,null,1426700791,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

false,unnatural_rights,num23,,"Honestly, after last season I'm prepared to treat him as a new signing.  New country, two managers, inconsistent first-team playing time, *horrible* tactical decisions by AVB and Sherwood in how to use him - and everyone seems to be forgetting that his wife miscarried, to which I genuinely attribute much of last season's struggles.  That sort of blow to a man's emotions and confidence can be devastating no matter what their profession.

Soldado's scored against Limassol and Forest, fine.  Adebayor's scored against QPR, hardly a Sisyphean feat.  I agree Kane has looked impressive, and I'm glad for the lad, and more than that I think he should be a solid substitute in the league while Soldado's being given a shot at starting regularly.

But if we're going to look at Soldado fresh and ask if he deserves to start, we should ask the same of Adebayor as well, and he certainly doesn't win that contest.  If nothing else, we spent all that money on Soldado and then last season forced him to try and play an entirely different style of football, then wondered why he wasn't as good as the man we thought we'd signed.  And like a true servant of the club, he put his head down and did his best to adapt to this new style of play.  And we're still fiddling with the details, and meanwhile he's being left out in the cold.

I think Moffat's building to something in the finale, as he usually does, but so is Capaldi in some ways, the two are building up to what his Doctor will ultimately be like. 

   So, I'll wait to render judgement on his Doctor until after the season finale, and see what Moffat and Capaldi have put together for how the Doctor finally comes out.

I think we're probably the least racist country in the world, for example. Despite the rise of UKIP, I still think there's no country better than us in that regard. Maybe Canada, but that's possibly about it. Almost every other first world country is too homogeneous or too uncomfortable with immigration in comparison.

We're also the least corruptible country in the world. Corruption is a concept you have to explain to people here, because most don't really understand it, or just use the word to label any sort of political injustice. The fact that a mere expenses scandal is the height of corruption in this country, demonstrates it. 

As Orwell put it, *""Here one comes upon an all-important English trait: the respect for constitutionalism and legality, the belief in âthe lawâ as something above the State and above the individual, something which is cruel and stupid, of course, but at any rate incorruptible.""*

We have the BBC, the pinnacle of journalism around the world. Impartial to a fault sometimes: you will get equal amounts of accusations of bias from either side of a debate. Watching the American counterpart for an impartial news source, such as CNN, will make you cringe in comparison.

We have our shit together. We are not plagued by blind nationalism, but we can act as one and act sensibly whenever we need to. We brought the world the welfare state, and we still uphold it - anybody who tries to bring it down, part by part even, is vilified by much of the community. Our capital city is a melting pot where 300 hundred languages are spoken, but it has never has never seen the blight of persistent and debilitating ethnic conflict.

There are many first world countries who think they have their shit together. Norway with its measly 5 million residents could be the most ""socialised"" country in the world, yet immigrants are fiercly hated by a large contingent of society, even those who consider themselves as left-leaning. America in comparison is a beast, a population of 300 million, yet I don't know where to begin to point out some of the delusions and flaws across its society.

The international break did us no favours to put it mildly, we're integrating new players at a faster rate than we wanted, and performances have suffered. If you're going to compare the run of form to previous managers though, why don't we actually do it?

[10-11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Liverpool_F.C._season) Hodgson won 1, lost 4 and drew 3 in his opening 8 games, with losses to City, our two biggest rivals and newly-promoted Blackpool. By January we were 12th having lost half our games when we lost to Blackpool again in fixture 21. Kenny took over and results improved to a reasonable standard.

[11-12](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9312_Liverpool_F.C._season#Matches) From the 3rd of January to April 7th Kenny lost 8, won 2 and drew 3, with losses to the likes of Bolton, QPR and Wigan as well as United, Arsenal and City. We finished 8th.

Big difference here is that neither of these managers ever showed anything like the consistency and incredible form we saw last season, even disregarding the fact that both had *much* worse runs of form than our current one if you look at it objectively. 2nd last year was an amazing achievement and should be enough to buy Rodgers a few seasons to get things working like that again. I think we'll finish top four this season still but 5th or 6th, though disappointing, would not be a total disaster in the toughest league in the world with a young team and a young manager not anywhere near competing on wages with our direct rivals. We took two steps forward last season, one step back after losing one of the best players in the world is something I would find totally acceptable, if far from ideal. Arsenal are consistent because they stuck by a manager who showed in his second season that he could achieve great things. United had major success due to sticking by a young manager they put their trust in despite a [terrible start to his tenure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989%E2%80%9390_Manchester_United_F.C._season). Hodgson is a dinosaur, he doesn't learn from his mistakes. Good young managers do and Rodgers has already shown he is one of those.

The king of giving the ball away right above our box is Joe Allen. There has been no one, save Gerrard (and only by virtue of his position at DM), that I've seen give the ball away so easily around our own box.

Rodgers and possession football is a good example. Rodgers talks about it and he wants to do it, but the approach that turned us into title contenders was a high pressing counter-attacking side. The myth of possession still got talked about though. Just like the myth of Joe Allen.

I'll be honest, to me that point suggests that person is new to football because they don't understand how managers normally react to their team not playing well.  Normally they'd try to protect their players and to not give the media something hype on about, which means they're very careful with what they say.  Media management is part of the job for them.

Which is that the players we signed came in with large expectations. From themselves and from fans. I don't think you'd consider Balotelli someone who is fazed either way, but players like Lallana, Lovren, and Markovic all had a lot to prove to themselves and the world. Because of their fees and the fact it's a step up.

Right now I think the clear problem is that we aren't keeping the ball with any sort of composure near the opponents box. And sadly I think Gerrard being our line of defense before our defense is part of the reason we have so little composure there. Man City has a group of tough CMs that can bully people off the ball if need be. Outside of Henderson we don't even have anyone with strength of stamina in the middle of the field. 

Ultimately Rodgers is going to have to make a tough call in January, if we don't right the ship by then. Do we stick with a slow DM who's only talent is the occasional dart of a ball, where the runner usually gets closed down before they're able to do anything. Or do we replace him in the starting 11 with someone who has a bit more steel.

No unionist leader has so far backed up his claim. He doesn't have numbers on his side in this argument.

&gt;he doesn't incite anyone to anything. I notice this article is from January, has it taken Marty nearly a year to get the troops mobilised?

The 16 attacks occurred over the period since his comments. By the same measure Paisley didn't 'incite' anyone either. Still being blamed by many accounts here for 'extending the troubles'. Why isn't the former IRA commander getting similar treatment?

&gt;Maybe if the OO could join the rest of us in the 21st century and stop wallowing in bigotry and supremacy then maybe vandals would stop attacking their property.

Leaving aside the tired supremacist  and bigotry lies, you seem to believe the actual bigots here, the people willing to burn others out of their religious buildings, are driven by a moral crusade.

I'll leave that one with you.

&gt;The apprentice boys had talks with residents in Derry years ago and now they have very little trouble. 

Right enough, the Apprentice Boys hall in the same town as each of the above attacks was left untouched.

The Chelsea game was a ridiculous farce that really turned out to be Distin's death knell, leading to Stones taking his place in the following weeks. Don't read too much into the Swansea loss, Roberto essentially threw it away.

The real key so far this season has been the injuries to Barkley and Pienaar (and Coleman, more recently). We don't have that possessive midfielder or winger who can keep or take the ball into the final third, which means Barry or McCarthy have to try to fill in some of what we're missing without Barkley. Unfortunately, neither are quite as good at beating defenders or linking up with the fullbacks, which leads to some shoddy passing and giving the ball away. Instead of having Barry covering with the two centerbacks as he does when Barkley's on the field, he's generally a bit further up leaving us very susceptible to a counter.

Beyond that, our back line has been more of a back jumble so far this season. They're not working well as a unit, allowing through balls and totally blowing assignments, which could be attributed to us shuffling the four around so much this early.

&gt;Tenthly, one should pour tea into the cup first. This is one of the most controversial points of all; indeed in every family in Britain there are probably two schools of thought on the subject. The milk-first school can bring forward some fairly strong arguments, but I maintain that my own argument is unanswerable. This is that, by putting the tea in first and stirring as one pours, one can exactly regulate the amount of milk whereas one is liable to put in too much milk if one does it the other way round.

The Caretaker episode to me showed me the type of Doctor we have now. The standout bits are when Clara asks the Doctor is being nice to her, he answers because it works on her. 

Then another standout areas are actually when Danny confronts the Doctor both times. Also when Danny tells Clara about the type of man the Doctor is and how she can never lie to Danny.

Just my opinion, so grain of salt and all that, I am hoping things continue to pick up for Capaldi's Doctor.

And that's where the anti-Welsh sentiment comes from. The Welsh Assembly spend an absolute fortune on sustaining the language, when we're a deprived nation in tough economic times. A lot of people feel that the language should live or die by its own merit, rather than having any official paperwork having to be sent out bilingually in every occasion, having every official call centre have a Welsh speaking option, have every school teacher trained to a basic level of speaking and understanding the language, etc. etc.

Welsh language isn't more in demand because the language is growing, it's more in demand because our taxes are paying for it to be.

It will send a very clear message to all politicians that at the end of the day, we accept that sometimes you can't always deliver on your promises... but ultimately people **will** hold you to account if you sell yourself out in such a considerable way.

false,Everton_11,crest,Bill's Brown Bomber,"1:  I personally think that United have too much quality in the team not finish at least fourth this year.  I doubt that a title challenge will be mounted.  City and especially Chelsea are just too good.  As for us, I think a sixth place finish is likely.  Historically we're slow starters.  I think there's a bit of second season syndrome, but the point we got at Anfield last weekend will hopefully give us a solid kick in the right direction (up).

2: You're not going to find many Everton fans who are big on Wayne Rooney.  We can recognize that the may have had to be sold to balance the books, but he didn't need to look so eager, especially after he said he'd stay forever.  It's part of the reason we like Barkely so much.  We see what Rooney could have been if he'd stayed with us, but we know Ross is more likely to stay.  This club is his life.  As for United players we like, I can't speak for anyone else, but I've always very much enjoyed watching Mata play.  Even when he was splitting us apart, his style is always a joy to watch.  He plays the game the way it should be played, and I very much respect that.

3: That's a difficult question to answer.  Sir Alex was always going to leave a pair of massive shoes to fill when he left, and I never really expected Moyes to be up to the task.  Considering the available managerial talent for United to pick up, Van Gaal was certainly one of the better options.  He's clearly a world class coach, but I question his ability to adapt to the tactical shifts the premier league will require with a squad that is not demonstrably world class though and through.  Not to mince words, but your defense is in shambles.  Admittedly, considering our goals conceded this season, I probably don't have much of a leg to stand on.  At Barca and Bayern, the squad was full of world-class talent at every position.  At Ajax, the Eredivisie is so attack minded that you can win without a world-class defense.  To summarize, I don't think it matters who your manager is with the state of the defense.  Unless Tony Pulis is sitting in the manager's seat at Old Trafford, United will ship goals by the bucketload this season.

4: There's a lot of criticism about Roberto around this sub recently, and I think so much of it is due to how well we did last season.  Our performance was nothing short of amazing.  Record number of wins and points in the PL era, most points since we won the title in '85, almost exactly one goal conceded per game.  We won at Old Trafford for the first time in the PL era.  It was an incredible season.  And before it started, everyone was very cautious.  Some even tipped us for relegation.  I was willing to give Martinez the benefit of the doubt.  That extends to this season.  I will admit that until recently, I had similar concerns about him that I mentioned above about Van Gaal.  He is an idealist.  He believes the game is meant to be played a certain way, and he wants to play it like that.  An open, attacking style can be easily destroyed a good counter attacking team, (See the Chelsea loss) or an exceedingly technically competent team able to make dangerous runs and pick the passes to hit those runs (See the Chelsea loss again).  However, last weekend, when we went to Anfield, we were very clearly set up in a defensive way, and for 90 minutes, save a moment of brilliance from Gerrard, they didn't get much.  That indicated to me that Martinez can find pragmatism when it is truly in the best interest of the team.  he knew we needed a result against Liverpool, and he knew that he couldn't set up the team the same way they were set up in January.  He adapted accordingly, and I think that needs to be recognized by more fans.

5: As an American fan, my thoughts on this are not all that strong.  I've never been to Goodison, but I hope I can get there before they tear it down.  It's definitely on my bucket list.

6: Fuck it, I'll have a punt.  2-2 with Lukaku and McGeady for us, and Falcao and Mata on the other side.

I want to rant about Brendan. About his tactics, some of his signings, his public talk about being in ""transition"".

 About his veiled criticism of both Balotelli's play and the whole signing of him to begin with. How he's signed someone we all know isn't a Sturridge-style player or Suarez-style player, yet then persists in playing him in tactics suited to them and then blames him for them not working.

About his mystifying repeated selection of Markovic, about how Sakho got dropped after a run where he was improving and Lovren actually looked worse. How Stevie, as much as I love the guy, really does need resting sometimes yet clearly never will be.

About how it's only October yet I'm already starting to panic about treating the CL like the Europa League and how finishing outside the top 4 this year really could be a disaster as the money coming in from the BT Sport deal for qualifiers this season will be huge.

I really, really want to rant about all that. But...

...I also don't feel comfortable doing it because, despite all the above, Brendan has done brilliantly as a young manager who's still learning the game to get us to 2nd last year. To have us playing the most joyful football I've seen from us in years. To somehow manage to get another incredible season out of Suarez when I thought his head was gone forever. To have developed Sterling, Sturridge and Hendo into top quality talent and maybe, just maybe, even Allen.

I can't help seeing the team I love do badly and wanting to lash out. But I also know that it's pointless because it's way too soon to react like that, because Brendan's proved he's good enough to sort it out, make it gel and turn it round.

Conflicted? Yes. But angry enough to lose the faith? Never.

We've started well in Europe I think, been a slow start to the league but we will finish around the same as last year. Haven't really made my mind up on United, I think you've had a soft start to the season, I don't think you'll be far off where you were last season either. 
.

Q2) Are there any current Manchester United Players that you particularly like and dislike?

There's quality, especially going forward. Falcao is quality, Rooney is still the stand out player for you in my opinion.
.


Q3) After the debacle last season with Moyes at United and the 7th place finish, would you be confident that VanGaal is the right man for us?

It was a sad sight the way Moyes was threated by United, he didn't really get any backing or support from the club. (Not talking about the fans here, who have been remarkably patient and classy generally) It was always going to be a challenge following Fergie but he was set up to be a scape goat and fired in a silly way and time.

I'm not Van Gaals biggest fan to be honest, then again I guess that's a good thing from a united perspective. Anything less than top 4 would be failure considering his spending, attitude and stature. 
.


Q4) What are your feelings this season on Martinez? Despite a great first season for you he his coming under increasing criticism on both results and performance. Do you still have confidence that he is the right man at Goodison.

I love the man, he is building something special at Everton. I think the performances and results have been average in the league so far this season but it's too early to be overly critical. I have no doubt we can sort the defense out, we are already okay going forward. I have absolutely no doubts RM is the right man to take this club forward.
.


Q5) What are your thoughts on the proposed stadium move to Walton Hall Park and also the approval of that lot over the park extending their capacity.

I have adapted a wait and see attitude towards new stadium debates.

His reputation in Spain is something that keeps coming back whenever we talk about him. What about Ade's reputation with us? 

He's had only one truly shocking season where he was frozen out of the squad for wearing a hat and his brother died. Other than that, Ade's been a great club servant for the last three or four seasons. Yet he keeps getting shit like ""mercenary"", ""lazy"", ""doesn't care about the team"", etc. thrown at him. He took on a leadership role last season while the squad was burning itself down trying to understand what Tim Sherwood was saying.

I'm not saying that Soldado shouldn't be given a chance, but why should that come at the expense of Ade? Every time he's been written off by the club or its fans, he comes back. Where would we have been without his fourteen goals for the second part of last season? 

Soldado might come good, but he's almost thirty. Even if he does, how long will we have a solid Soldado for? Two, maybe three good seasons of him *maybe* putting in 20? 

If he wants to start in the league, he's going to have to do the basic function of a striker and start fucking scoring. All the other stuff that he does, like link up with the midfielders and pick a good pass, that's nice, but we didn't shell out 30 for that.

Regardless of what happens, we need a 25 year old striker. Someone who's not too far from their prime, but for the most part is the finished product. Bony and Destro are two names I've thrown up, but it's really whatever.

false,GwalstawdIeithoedd,welsh,Wales,"&gt; And that's where the anti-Welsh sentiment comes from. The Welsh Assembly spend an absolute fortune on sustaining the language, when we're a deprived nation in tough economic times. A lot of people feel that the language should live or die by its own merit, rather than having any official paperwork having to be sent out bilingually in every occasion, having every official call centre have a Welsh speaking option, have every school teacher trained to a basic level of speaking and understanding the language, etc. etc.
&gt; 


So by ""fortune"" you mean an annual amount equivalent to 0.000036% of Trident budget? The amount spent on promoting Welsh isn't much in the grand scheme of things. Additionally, providing Welsh paperwork isn't just with the aim of propping up the language; some people are genuinely much more comfortable using services in their native language (unsurprisingly) and I think being able to access these things in Welsh should be a right. It's not a case of seeing if the language 'lives or dies on its own merit'. In that case, should we get rid of English signs and paperwork and let it work on its own merit? Not having Welsh options is actively suppressing the language in my opinion.

I know it's difficult to see the value or the point of it as an English-speaker (particularly if you don't live in a very Welsh-speaking area) but I've personally found much anger directed towards the language (and the government initiatives on it) to be misplaced, and it kind of upsets me to feel my native language (and therefore a big part of my identity) met with such disdain. :[

My missus used to make the brew by putting the milk in the cup first. I had to educate her on her wayward leanings there and she's come around to appreciate this over the years... I can taste a brew steeped in milk straight out. Although the method has one thing going for it - you get a cooler brew straight out. (there's a debate with teh nature of thermodynamics in that im sure) Funnily enough, the missus can make a brew cooler than I can, I have no idea how its possible but utilising a similar technique she can make a brew several degrees colder than I everytime, this perplexes me greatly.

false,Jamaicaman90,cnty-wales,Swansea,"&gt;So by ""fortune"" you mean an annual amount equivalent to 0.000036% of Trident budget?

I was going more on the Welsh budget rather than the UK budget. You're looking at more of a ~0.5% then, which is sizable.

As for the paperwork, I'm not entirely talking about the options. My student finance came with double the pages it needs, as they send both Welsh and English versions rather than asking in the application. The same goes for an incredible amount of paperwork that the public has to deal with (like censuses, dealing with the DWP, and so on) - instead of asking which you'd like at the earliest convenient point, they send you both languages at every stage from start to finish.

The thing I *didn't* go into but is also a major factor in attitudes to the language is how abysmal the lessons are in English medium schools. I wouldn't like to assume that you go to one medium or the other, but I can tell you both as a product of English medium Welsh schools and from working in them as an adult, the Welsh syllabus is horrific. It's boring, it's repetitive, it's frustrating and it fails to follow pretty much all of the common-sense teaching methods you'd find in a French or German language class, and I say this as a multilinguist. There's no conjugation, no detail of sentence structure, no explanation of quirks of the language (mutation? It just happens, don't worry about it). It's just endless phrases that you're supposed to remember verbatim, with the exception of where you plug in your word for 'semi-detached' or 'terraced'.

By no means am I saying that the Welsh language has no value. I'm saying that the Welsh Assembly (particularly Plaid) push it far too hard, and in the wrong direction. It's borderline traumatic for a lot of kids in school and it ruins any hope of them wanting to approach it of their own free will, and then they get into the adult world and have it pointlessly pushed under their noses again. No wonder they react badly to it.

Another issue is how *some* Welsh speakers treat those who can't like muck, but that's another debate entirely I think and not really a detail that I should spend too much time on, as we'd end up just pointing back and forth about the minorities of our two sides who behave poorly.

I'm happy to debate the subject with you, I'm not militantly anti-Welsh language, far from it. I do feel strongly though that the way it's promoted at the moment is farcical and detrimental both to the growth of the language, our local economy, and to relations between speakers and non-speakers.",0,1412364245,null,0,false,0,ckzmbnn,t3_2i6o4h,t1_ckzmbnn,t1_ckzluok,null,1426698232,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

1. I like my Doctor to be a more kindly, heroic sort. I especially like the dichotomy of ""wise old man in a young man's body"", that you got a lot from 10 and 11, without the condescending nature of 9 and 12. 10/11 are very deeply invested in helping humans and saving human lives. You'd never get the ""She's my carer, she cares so I don't have to."" line from them, especially about saving lives from the Daleks. He seems to be invested in nothing -- two hearts, both of them devoid of emotion. How much of that is Capaldi vs. the writers, I don't know, but they're running out of time to avoid baking that into his characterization irrevocably. 

2. I like the Doctor to express wonder - that even at 3000 years old, there's more in the universe to see and be amazed by. Capaldi's Doctor is very sardonic and negative. For example: Had Amy said she wanted to visit Robin Hood, 11 would have gleefully bought into the possibility for adventure and probably even dressed for the occasion. 12 bitched about it the entire episode.

3. It's probably because I'm hard of hearing, but I have a very hard time understanding 12's accent. It just sounds like mumbles to me -- imagine the teacher on any Charlie Brown movie.  It's a minor frustration, but it screws up the delivery of jokes and such when I already know what he's going to be said by virtue of needing the subtitles on to understand him.

4.

I get what you're saying.

So at least there's that. I agree that it's NO surprise that anyone who went through that system resents the language. I probably would too.


I can tell you're not militantly anti-Welsh language, and I'm not militantly pro-Welsh (well...in my own estimations I'm not...).

I notice that every time we get a new doctor I initially dislike him and then eventually grow to love him.  

I think that there are two reasons for this.

1.) You have grown so used to the old guy that losing him feels like saying goodbye to a old friend. 

2.) The actors, writers, everybody needs to get their sea legs.  If you ever watch re-runs of early episodes of classic shows (like Frasier or Seinfeld) the early episodes SUCK. 
I think it just takes a while for everything to get fleshed out. Quirky little things the actor does eventually become canon and give the character depth. the writers evolve too as they invent more and more things that define the guy.

So having said all that:

Give the guy a chance. I think he's going to get us far in Europa and win us the treble. It's early days. My mate works in the hotel the team stays at before games. It's a completley new work ethic from the team. They now have a set menu. John Colins has given my friend explecit orders that if anyone orders something that isn't approved is to get grassed in. How bad is it that you cannot trust your players? 

Also the team weren't fit enough. Look at Commons at the start of every season. He pounds on the weight. He should know better. The diet of athletes in Scotland is atrocious. Were the laughing stock of Europe. Buckfast, coke and kebabs on a friday night for a player isn't the way forward. It's shocking. We were blowoing it out our arses last night.

Their energy policy is a bit of a non issue however, as I've argued before, and will continue to argue. The time spent in building nuclear power stations would mean we still wouldn't meet the energy gap which is predicted to arise pretty soon. If you take the current and previous government's policy on nuclear energy then you'll still be waiting several years after said gap, as they state that the private sector must do the investing first and foremost.

The quality of a football manager is displayed over a long term. And no matter how good - you ALWAYS get a dip in form here and there.

Thinking that you have the right - as a Liverpool supporter - to get on the managers back during a bad month shows why MANY ON THIS SUB really don't have a clue have it takes to be a Liverpool supporter. Just watching the Reds on TeeVee doesn't tell you half of what being a Liverpool supporter really means.

Support the team. Support the manager. In the bad times, as well as the good.

For fucks sake - just get someone to actually spell out all the words in our most famous song. If nothing else, that should educate you.

Save the usual pathetic excuses of ""oh, does this mean we can't ever critcise ...."". Of course it doesn't mean that. But if you have a chap who HAS demonstrated that he is cut from the right cloth, then you HOLD YOUR FIRE when the team is going through a bad patch.

And you sing louder.

Thats if any of you lot have ever been to Anfield. Judging by a good portion of this sub's fickle behaviour, I doubt if many of you could even locate the city of Liverpool on an unmarked map.

If you can't uphold the true meaning of what being a Liverpool supporter really means, then at least admit you're just a fair-weather hanger-on, and when things are tight - just be quiet. We don't mind you enjoying OUR club when its fun - as long as you lot stop pissing in your pants (and on the front lawn) when things get hard.

false,Jamaicaman90,cnty-wales,Swansea,"Yeah, hopefully. It certainly needs to be through people embracing it though, rather than hamfistedly forcing it on them. At times (as in during Welsh lessons) it's like a reverse Welsh knot the way they carry on, where kids are told they can't have a question answered unless they say it in Welsh. Talk about frustration.

I remember once, at the age of 16 sitting my compulsory half-GCSE classes, a supply teacher came in, looked at what we were doing (describing people as tall, short, thin, fat, etc., for the millionth time), and instead showed us how to conjugate a basic verb. Maybe a lot of people didn't care; the class was mainly people who were doing their best to avoid foreign language altogether, but as a French and Spanish student I loved finally having something put in front of me that I could mold into a sentence of my choosing. Unfortunately later that week it was back the the phrasebook 'fill the gap' Welsh sentences.

As it goes, I've had to study Welsh as an adult prior to working in classrooms. I got onto the subject with the class tutor, and she said that there actually doesn't yet exist a modern method of teaching the language, and all exams (at least in the educational field) revolve around being able to recite a set list of phrases rather than showing competence in using the language as a tool when faced with needing to comprehend or express new ideas.

Maybe that's the way forward in this. Instead of having every bit of Welsh language government scheme be something that the public are pushed into immediately (such as 'from now on all schools must cover these subjects, from now on all documents must include a full translation, from now on all TV broadcasters must include 10% Welsh medium content (I made the last one up to fit the theme)), they should instead use the funding to work on things behind closed doors for a while, something that can *later* be presented to the public in a meaningful way, like a new, tried and tested methodology in how to teach the language in an engaging and effective manner. It's almost as if at the moment everything is for show and just exists because the WAG have to be *seen* to be promoting the language, but it's all hollow and pointless. They're focusing on being seen as pro-Cymraeg rather than actually building a strong future for the language, maybe again because the politics of it make it more beneficial for them personally.

The serum is likely loaded with silicones (suffix -cone, -conol, -xane). That's not a terrible thing, they are gentle for many people and do act as a barrier in a similar way to your petroleum jelly. But they don't 'nourish' the skin.

The skin barrier needs lipids like cholesterol, ceramides, phytosphingolipids, saturates like stearic or palmitic acid. Best price of these even in the UK seems to be CeraVe in the tub/ body lotion from Amazon (face lotions are small bottles so pricier but the PM version does have niacinamide).

Natural ingredients that supply some of these include lanolin and lecithin (from eggs or soy). Medical grade lanolin that most companies use now is considered hypoallergenic.

Skincare ingredients that boost the skin's own ceramide synthesis include niacinamide and very low percentages of lactic acid. You already have the links on niacinamide.

Some of the Eucerin moisturisers have 5% urea, tho it does crop up in other products. I saw it listed for an ~~Asda or~~ **Aldi** serum the other day assuming the ingredients have not changed since the blog post ~~I'll check and edit this.~~

As for disliking your guys, I hate Ashley Young, as does basically everybody who watches the PL these days...everybody. I don't particularly like Rooney...I don't blaim him for leaving, but i still think he's just an annoying guy. The way he always yells at the refs appealing for decisions....his red card he just got was disgraceful, the guy needs to grow up and learn what being a Captain in the epl means. As for liing your players, I've always had a soft spot for RVP and De Gea.

The jury is still out on Van Gaal...you guys have been shocking lately, considering the attacking talent you have. The 3-5-2 only works when you have 3 good cb's and Wide mids that can track back. United have no good cb's and their mids don't track back as much as they should. Although its interesting, he's turned you guys into the Netherlands national team, stylistically at least. Dangerous attack, shit defense. So it's a potential high risk high reward system, i'll wait till January before i will really judge him too harshly. Although its worth noting that he has started much much worse than Moyes did. With the opening group of fixtures you've played, United should be on top of the league on paper, but are out of the top 10, and on top of that, there was the loss to MK Dons of all teams.

I like Martinez, but i feel like at times his positivity has hurt us. For instance in the Arsenal game, after conceding to cut our lead to 1 with about 10 minutes left, he subs on an attacking player instead of another defender, and guess what...we conceded again and drew a game we should have won by two. I still have incredible confidence in him though, we've had about as tough a set of opening fixtures we could have been given, and we've showed flashes of the top 4 team which Roberto wants us to be, we just need to work on defending, and get Ross Barkley fit again, and we should be set. 

I'm split on the stadium move. Goodison is part of what makes Everton...well ""Everton"". Ideally, I wish we would just renovate and expand Goodison, but if that is out of the cards, i guess a move has to happen eventually. We are an ambitious club, and our stadium should reflect our goals. 

As for predictions, I have no idea who will win this game. A 3-1 United victory is just as likely as an Everton 2-1 victory. ",0,1412367289,null,0,false,0,ckznvyi,t3_2i7hq9,t1_ckznvyi,t3_2i7hq9,null,1426697502,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3

Everton: Sixth or seventh (behind Southampton maybe) would be reasonable I think, but hey maybe Spurs will be Spurs and United will crash and burn and we'll sneak into 4th, pipe dream but still.

2) Yeah, Everton fans aren't fond of Rooney, but you knew that. Always hated Chicharito, but as he's not around at the moment I've got no other complaints. Who do I like? DDG is a very good keeper, otherwise I've got no opinions. 

3) LVG's not a particularly good defensive type and your defense lacks talent; on the other hand, he can attack, and your attack is fucking stacked. So it'll be really hit or miss I think. I think the lack of world-class talent on the whole team is what really hurts United.

4) I don't know how much to blame on Martinez right now. I think he's botched a lot of substitutions this year, I can't understand playing Howard in the Cup, etc., but I don't think I can blame him for Jags and Distin (and Howard too) losing their fucking minds all the time. The lack of cohesion up front is what really worries me, but I give him a pass as we've already seen a boatload of injuries. I do believe in his ability to right the ship, I don't think I'll feel differently until we've got 19 points in 19 games or something like that.

5) Let me go to Goodison first (yeah another American) then we'll see what my opinion on the issue is. Certainly something for the locals to really have something to say about.

I visited Paris in 2012 and my impression after arriving at Gare du Nord from St Pancras was that it was dark, dirty and depressing place in comparison with London station. Their underground stations are mostly also very dark, dimmed light with broken, abandoned vending machines. Nothing seemed to work there and nobody cared about it - maybe about third of streetlights worked and I was really worried about my safety because of that (I was staying at hotel in Basitille, which is comparable in status to Islington). Streets were dirty, full of fast food crap even in most representative parts of Paris. Shitty graffiti all over the walls. No-one cared at all. Comparing Paris to London is like completely different worlds - in London there is always someone looking after every aspect of public life - be it rubbish on the streets or graffiti removal teams from council. In London there is always some work going on - improving streets, changing pavement, road layout, redecorating some building fronts etc, a lot of construction. While I didn't see that in Paris at all. My impression was that it was almost like  abandoned city - and I didn't feel safe at night at all with all these hookers, pimps and dealers. Many backstreets are ruined buildings with no roofs and mostly collapsed walls which are turned to parking lots. Imagine the sight. While in London I practically see no difference in walking at night and day in - lets say Islington or Camden.

I've never done a taste test myself, but that's a good enough reason to me.  Also, contrary to what a lot of people say, I find it simpler to judge the right amount with milk-first.  Pouring it in after which you have to do by final color, and the tea has to be mobile for it to get properly mixed, so sometimes you have to stir it, requiring a spoon etc..  If the tea is a bit strong you can find yourself with over-milked tea by trying to get the color right.  Milk-first, it's perfectly mixed and easy to judge.

Similar reactions will occur to the milk proteins if you slowly pour cold milk into hot tea, but it's not as visible - the main consequence is that it impacts the flavor of the tea, but there's no 'chunks' or anything else obvious.  My intention here was to provide a common analogy that would help people understand the argument behind pouring the millk in first.

Thinking milk in tea is weird is equivalent to thinking coffee and milk is weird.

I also found the same thing to be true when I visited the UK.  Teas are just heavier than here.  It's like they are higher quality or something. /s

On the other hand, a lot of Asian teas don't carry the same heaviness.  For example, I would never put milk in brown-rice tea or green tea.  It's too light and the taste and texture would be... off?

I miss tea, and I drink a lot less of it now. When I make a cuppa there's no communal ""Anyone else?"" so it just feels a little sad drinking tea alone. Oh and biscuits aren't really a thing either, well, not in the same way.

I obviously still miss my family and friends, homesickness really hit me after 3 weeks or so, when it became obvious I was going to be here for a long while. Be prepared for that.

What's better? A lot, the weather for one. I also can't stress how nice it is being British over here. Everyone is interested/happy to see you when you start speaking. It really is a huge confidence booster to be around people who genuinely want to talk to you. I'm in the South though so I'm not sure if that hospitality is nationwide.

Banter? Meh, it's here but it's different. You can't call your mates cunts, or really take the piss as harshly as I would in the UK. Banter is still there it's just a lot less insult based. People seem to take things to heart a little more than they do in England.

false,Antsonfire,num18,,"&gt;I donât think we do need to buy a new striker, I just think we need to change our style of play to help Soldado out and make sure he is getting the supply he needs to score goals.

Disagree with this, particularly because I do agree with the members of the ""DAE think Soldado is going to open the floodgates if he's given regular chances?"" brigade in terms of needing him to play in the first team, just to see if he fits in or not. 

If a system has to change to accommadate a player, then it's not the system's fault, it's the player's for not fitting into it. It's still too early into Poch's term to see where he fits, so there's that. 

Personally, I'd just like to move on from Soldado. IMO, people here speak more out of hope than expectation that he can get back to massive figures again, so maybe selling him off for the most anyone's willing to pay (I think he could do a job at Napoli if Higuain leaves this summer, maybe rebuild himself at Spain) and getting Bony, J-Rod or whoever would be a good deal.  

Out of all the players last year, most of them were bought for their ceiling. Look at the average age of them. Soldado's the only outlier in that department (28, getting into his prime, virtually no resale value after three/four years, unlike, say, Lamela, Eriksen, Chadli, etc.), so it's safe to say that the impact he was supposed to make was going to be immediate in practice. Unfortunately it hasn't worked out that way, and I'm not seeing any reason why he can turn it around.

However for myself and everybody else who does this sort of thing for a living it was just another day and ""you"" are just another face. Usually it doesn't matter what crime has been committed, most of the staff I've worked with don't take that in to account much and most I've seen have been very professional, and they do look after those in custody fairly well. If you are nice to the officers, then you get treated well, if you kick off and act violently surprisingly to some, you still get treated decently.

Sure I try to be as nice as possible, and very tolerant of the fact that its an unusual and stressful situation but I have a job to do and I try to do it well.

I'm mostly worried about getting things right and not cocking up a case or cocking up paperwork to be honest and a lot of the time its just matter of fact process and quite boring.

Police, court staff and prison officers are just people at the end of the day and have a job to do. There are some arseholes and some people just not good at their job but they tend to make life difficult for themselves and those they work with and tend to get pulled up pretty quickly. The vast majority I've seen have been very professional.

So I'd say yes these guys know they are on camera and its hard to behave normally, but what is shown isn't too far off.

Actually I think its important to remember that its a stressful, life changing time for the ""customer"" and you have to look at it from their perspective and treat the ""customer"" as you want to be treated, be patient and explain things well.

I don't think killing an aid worker is really defensible by even the most radical Muslims in the west compared to executing Muslims of the opposite sect which ISIS supporters might see as much less or maybe a good thing. Aid workers in Syria are not holding ISIS up or stopping them from progressing so executing them is just pointless if your aim is a true caliphate. It was the promise of a true Islamic Caliphate which attracted Muslims from around the world because Islam as a religion is stuck in the 7th century and harkens back to a time when most of the Middle East was one country and many Muslims believe it should still be one country. This group came along and for the first time in over 1300 years and said we will create a new caliphate on the same scale as the one established after Muhammad not just one focused on a single region but over the whole Middle East smashing modern colonial borders. No wonder people were excited. Trouble is that to have such a radical vision you also have to be pretty crazy. I think what most Muslims who thought of going to ISIS are realising is that it's just a brutal repressive gang and not a serious attempt at statecraft. If that's true then the more aid workers they kill the amore attention they draw away from their vision and a new state and towards their brutality and it will push people away. I can only see this working against them I they should have seen that if they were smart enough but I don't think they are. 

The US is not going to put boots on the ground, this is the perfect scenario for them. Another army is doing the fighting on the ground and the US can just pound ISIS into dust with little threat to it's personnel. A perfect PR war - consistent victories and no deaths of their people plus a number of executions which ensure public support remains behind this largely costless campaign. They'll do anything to avoid another Iraq so any idea on the terrorists part that this will be good PR for ISIS is misguided. Because the US is unlikely to lose many personnel this can be a long term mission with little cost other than money and there's no need to actually occupy.

I think its more propaganda oriented than that. They want to show their prospective recruits they ""mean business"" and they want to jab at the west. They're mostly incapable of any direct swipe (save something like 9/11) because they're always met by the west on their doorstep when they start to setup their state (ever since Afghanistan crumbled). So they're basically stuck in this scenario where the West always smack them down and its geographically impossible to directly fight back. Hence this sort of shit.  
If anything I'd say this sort of thing is equivalent of the Kenyan mall shooting of their fight in Somalia. A vain attempt to shift the fight elsewhere (in this case onto media).

I doubt very much they consider the suffering. To them we're all zombies inflicted with the plague (I forget their exact term for this but they have one) of western culture.

Anyway, my heart doesn't agree at all but my head does. I think back to the beheadings I used to read about in Chechnya. I remember once, many years ago, a friend of mine linked me a video of a soldier (probably Russian?) literally lining up young men and cutting their heads off with a machete one by one. I thought it was a spoof video at first until I heard the gargled screams ... I was outraged, as any person would be. Needless to say I quickly told my friend what I thought of him sending me that.

Or of the atrocities committed in the various tribal wars in Africa only a decade or so ago. I don't even want to remember the things I have read about those conflicts ... 

This kind of stuff is absolutely disgusting but it's common in war, we are just sensitive toward it because we live in such a peaceful country. Regardless, the more I hear about ISIS the stronger my belief hardens; we have to do what we can to stop these guys from conquering Iraq and Syria. They will surely commit more atrocities on a larger scale if they are allowed to grow in strength.

The stuff about Spurs thinking there was a release clause is news to me, and quite interesting. Also, why the fuck is everyone jumping on this Luke Shaw diet bandwagon. This article says we had doubts about his diet. The kid was 18, we were his club - if we had doubts what the fuck were we doing about it?! Seems petty of us to suggest we were worried about his weight/diet, that's our fault as much as his. I thought the same when Hodgson came out a few weeks ago that he was worried about Shaw's weight/fitness over the summer. Why was he in your World Cup squad then? 
  
A few other things:  
It doesn't got into any detail about Jay Rodriguez, but I do remember Saints giving quite a bit of attention to the fact they were offering Jay a new contract in the summer. That story has disappeared off the radar, which worries me.   
  
Shane Long was a long term target apparently. The same Shane Long that was sold for Â£7m six months before we bought him for Â£12m? If he was a long term target surely we would have snapped him up then? Something doesn't add up there.   
  
The article glosses over Lallana's concerns about lack of communication very briefly. Sure, it mentions it. But the narrative in this article is that Saints do everything right so it doesn't go into any detail about what we might have done wrong. Maybe we didn't do anything wrong, I don't know. I'd be surprised though.

The immolation is gruesome enough but for some illogical reason the stick beating on top of that just pushed it into a whole new realm of barbarism for me.  

Yeah Chechnya was so fucked up. That's why they had to have that second war. They sued for peace but that just let the wound fester and the region was ruled by warlords who only knew how to fight. That's why when the nationality of the Boston Marathon Bombers was released it all sort of made ""sense"". How could anyone escape that country of that time with any sort of sanity left in them?  

I don't mind the down votes as this is the whole point (as long as I have that little red cross). I want to be that person pissing against the wind when this sort of thing happens. The person who asked for restraint following 9/11 would have downvoted beyond the lowest point a scrollbar could reach but its important they're there to at least put that idea into people's subconscious to let it churn around and maybe change their view later on.  

My heart also wants to fuck over these ISIS fuckers. I despise their ideology and their barbaric practices..... however my head is less sure. Surely this is just a repeat of Afghanistan and Somalia. Will this be the last mole to whack or will another mole just pop up? What is the best solution to all of this? I'm not really that sure.  
If I'm going to make a punt I think we need to find the backers. I think this is all just a proxy war for the sake of the real interest which is the Sunni/Shia fight and I'd suspect these strings go back somewhere in the Arabian peninsula (Yemen... or Saudi Arabia or one of the Emirates).

""Balotelli did not touch the ball in the opposition penalty area during Liverpool's Champions League defeat to Basel on Wednesday, but his manager offered a qualified defence.
""That is down to the team. You have to get yourself into those areas but it was about the service arriving in and our quality wasn't to the standard,"" added Rodgers.
""But you also have to be able to score and create goals yourself as a front player and he didn't do that.""""

Rodgers knows that the team isn't giving Balotelli the kind of service he needs, and that Mario is operating at 7/10 level right now.

To help, to discover the truth, irrespective of the potential cost. For selfless reasons, they will merely be a name on an article (or even an unnamed camera man) or forever lost as some bod who drove a lorry that fed starving people but yet they still go there.  
My worry with using colourful language around their killings is that it risks us returning there for ""impure"" reasons, if you catch my drift.  

AND BY NO MEANS am I saying your passion is wrong. The ONLY reason I can say all this so coldly is because I am not involved. You could bet all the shiny buttons in the shiny button shop that if this happened to someone I loved I'd be straight over there looking to sign up and fight them calling them murderers, butchers and spineless bastards (because that's what they are).  

&gt; Fundamentally, there are very very few conflicts which have achieved net good in the world, and it is sad that we find ourselves embroiled in so much bloodshed.  

I'd like to hope that one day we might separate ourselves from our military interventionist ways and focus more on our cultural output. Like the way the BBC is trusted by so many around the globe. 
Its funny because even in Asia where the Brits have historically done so many bad things I often hear people (especially of the older generation, typically through stories of students that come here to study) have immense respect for the UK over..... say America.  
So I'd hope that a British voice anywhere in any sort of conflict zone might be seen as one of a neutral and one to respect or at the very least not butcher. Much like it says on our passports.   

I think somewhere in the depths of my heart I'm somewhat of a naive idealist but I really wish we could afford to be more like this in the world. I am a great believer of the ways of Gandhi. I know he gets flak for some of his sexual misdemeanors but they way he managed to forge the independent state of India without resorting to the sort of bloodshed we see here is worthy of so much respect that the likes of ISIS couldn't even dream of achieving.

Now that the Doctor has openly acknowledged the ""War Doctor"", the Capaldi characterization displays some traits I would expect to see in that man of war:

* Inability to grasp social cues.  When you're fighting an enemy which supposedly doesn't have them, like Daleks, you don't need that skill.
[Examples:  Capaldi says ""If you're going on a date, why aren't you dressed up?""  Clara's exasperated response ""I am!"".  His confusion regarding her make-up ""You look all colored-in.""  Entirely misreading Clara's interactions with men, and assuming the wrong guy is her boyfriend, when the cues were obvious.]
* Quick temper; rude, yet efficient responses.  [""Shut up!"" is becoming a frequent retort, rather than a rambling, time-consuming attempt at insult humor.  Hey, at least he's direct and to the point.]
* An angry visage.  [Eyes and expressions are intense, and come on, those eyebrows!]

It seems to me that the Doctor has finally accepted the part of himself which was the War Doctor.  That incarnation had a job to do, and likely had little (if any) of the fun galavanting around time &amp; space that all the others enjoyed.  So, Capaldi's Doctor feels to me like part of the War Doctor finally having a life.

There is also something strange happening with Capaldi's era - Moffat seems to be favoring a much darker, more violent Doctor. He seems unabashed to kill and destroy, which I find is more in tune with Colin Baker, and that makes me shudder because that was some psychotic and unforgivable shit. 

Also, the writing diminishes the Doctor. He is no longer that guy with a developed conscience and in fact, the Listen episode I found to be quite dismissive of this alien who can not only travel through time but is a TimeLord for all kind of physiological and mental processes too.

When Sturridge and Allen get fit I think we have that core. The Spurs game was not a fluke and we are capable of that kind of consistency (see start of last season when Suarez was banned).

I'm disappointed that BR would say it's a transition period given the perfect storm of awfulness that just hit us. It doesn't have to be a time of transition if we remain healthy, field a more consistent first XI, and BR learns from his tactical mistakes. However this is not a reason to freak the fuck out.

false,Norvaldov,lfc68,,"Think some of it has to be down to injuries as well. With Sturridge and Allen fit, we would have had more of our core in place and could have let the new players get time in a fairly coherent unit.

Pure speculation, naturally, but with those two fit and Lallana ready at the start of the season I think we'd have gotten him into his stride fairly quickly, playing him and Sterling out wide, Sturridge up front and Gerrard and Henderson as two of the midfield three would basically be the England setup. Lallana has come in late but is improving.

This would have eased the pressure on Markovic, who's quite evidently struggled initially. I think the time he *has* gotten now will be a positive for him, but I also think he would have been eased into it if we had other options out wide. 

Wit Sturridge fit I'd think Balotelli would have been looking at some games coming off the bench and would be allowed to harass some tired defenders.Starting him up front with Sturridge would make our attack a lot less one dimensional.

The whole 'doing a Spurs' thing has been thrown around a lot, and while I can appreciate the similarities (Bale/Suarez out, heaps of money in), Spurs brought in players to replace five of the six players in midfield and attack in their starting eleven (arguably). The way I see it, Lallana was probably the only one we definitely wanted to incorporate in our front six straight off the bat, with Balotelli as a maybe. Without the injuries, we could have introduced the new players to the team at a more reasonable pace. 

We did change a lot more at the back, however, but both Manquillo and Moreno have looked positive going forward and a lot of our attacks start by going through Gerrard anyway, so the, at times, drastic setback in our attacking play probably has less to do with changes at the back. There was a lot of chopping and changing in our defense last year, and so far it's been more of the same (Skrtel's injury partly to blame). I for one am hoping we settle on something and stick with it for a while, even if the results don't come right away (wouldn't mind dreadfully if that meant a Lovren/Sakho partnership).",0,1412378315,null,0,false,0,ckzsw4u,t3_2i84qr,t1_ckzsw4u,t1_ckzqlti,null,1426695155,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Not keen on Van Persie. Rafael is a bit of a snide, too. 

*Q3) Too early to say, but have a funny feeling he'll leave his post in the not so distant future. Not sure if he's cut out for this league, could obviously be wrong. 

*Q4) Yeah, fully behind Martinez. Can't help with injuries, as that's massively effected our start to the season. Can't help but feel that we spent too much on Lukaku though, happy we got him but maybe the money should have been used on a couple of players instead. That would be my only, minor, gripe. 

*Q5) Can only be a good thing, really. Think a new stadium is a must if we want to seriously progress as a club, and not get left behind the super-rich. As for the Anfield developments; Liverpool have ruined that area around Anfield, with derelict housing surrounded the stadium after a failed attempt to renovate Anfield previously. I'm surprised (well, not really) that the Liverpool council have enabled them to proceed with another attempt. 

*Q6) Have a feeling it'll be a high scoring game; we'll be knackered after  a midweek trip to Russia and you lot don't have a particularly impressive defence (neither do we, really, but showing signs of improvement with Stones and Jagielka as a partnership) so I'll go with 2-3 to Everton.

This is all after she already put her foot in her mouth with her soldier remark.  

Most of the first date difficulties are caused by Clara herself, and while it might have been a disastrous first date, they both moved on from it.  Other than that, their relationship hasn't really been tumultuous until the Doctor shows up in The Caretaker.  And that point, it is the Doctor and Clara that are causing the problems.  The Doctor, by being superior and condescending and Clara for defending his behavior.  

I think that Danny is an excellent character because he is not immediately taken in by the Doctor and doesn't immediately become enraptured by the idea that he is a Time Lord that can travel through time and space.  Instead, he is quite willing to call him out on his BS.  

As for as your perception that he is about to yell or hit someone where he talks, I don't know where this comes from.  In fact, Danny is quite soft-spoken and often seems almost emotionally numb, as you might expect from a soldier who is having trouble processing and dealing with his past.  Judging by his reaction to the kid asking about his past, there is something there he is not proud of or is having trouble moving on from.

The nobility are the highest ranking members of the aristocracy and are those with inherited (or bought, or granted) landed titles. They come in ranks, in order of seniority:

Emperor/Empress

King/Queen

Duke/Duchess

Marquess/Marchioness

Earl/Countess

Viscount/Viscountess

Baron/Baroness

When I say landed, I mean the titles are attached to a specific place. E.g. Queen of he United Kingdom, Duke of Cornwall. 

In addition to the nobility, the aristocracy also has the gentry. This is the category that knights are in (unless they also hold a noble title), along with baronets, esquires, and other ""gentlemen"".

""Royalty"" fits in with this system in an odd way. The position of a ruling monarch is clear, following the above order of seniority. But Princes and Princesses less so. ""Prince"" and ""Princess"" aren't landed titles, and in this system, land is everything. But still they have certain respect paid to them e.g. the address ""your royal highness"". But they would have had no real power by virtue of their title as Prince, back in the times when these titles meant something.

For that reason, princes (and to a lesser extent princesses, different because they were expected to marry and thus take on their husband's title) would either be granted a landed title (for example how Prince William was made the Duke of Cambridge) or would use a lesser title held by their parent (called a courtesy title). This is how the title ""Prince of Wales"" for the monarch's heir came about.

&gt;The __Tunguska event__ was a large [explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosion) which occurred near the [Podkamennaya Tunguska River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podkamennaya_Tunguska_River) in what is now [Krasnoyarsk Krai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasnoyarsk_Krai), [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire), at about 07:14 [KRAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasnoyarsk_Time) (00:14 [UT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Time)) on June 30 [O.S. June 17], 1908.    The explosion occurred at an altitude of 5â10 kilometres (3â6Â mi) at 60.886Â°N, 101.894Â°E. It is classified as an [impact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event) even though the asteroid or comet is believed to have burst in the air rather than hit the surface.  Different studies have yielded widely varying estimates of the impacting object's size, on the order of 60Â m (200Â ft) to 190Â m (620Â ft).  It is the largest impact event on or near Earth in [recorded history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorded_history).

&gt;Since the 1908 event, there have been an estimated 1,000 scholarly papers (mainly in Russian) published on the Tunguska explosion. Many scientists have participated in Tunguska studies: the best known are [Leonid Kulik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Kulik), [Yevgeny Krinov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Krinov), [Kirill Florensky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirill_Florensky), Nikolai Vladimirovich Vasiliev, and Wilhelm Fast.  In 2013, a team of researchers led by Victor Kvasnytsya of the [National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Sciences_of_Ukraine) published analysis results of micro-samples from a peat bog near the blast epicenter showing fragments that may be of meteoric origin.

Both of these things freak him out because he feels like he is the butt of some sort of trick or joke and he doesn't like that. This is all after she already put her foot in her mouth with her soldier remark.

The problems with the date started with his bad reaction to her soldier remark. To me the date looked like a montage of a promising date devolving into a shitty date. When she went back after her adventure to give him a second chance he immediately got defensive with her about her using a name. To me it's weird that he had such an angry reaction since they work at the same school and that information could have gotten out a million ways.

&gt;Most of the first date difficulties are caused by Clara herself

She didn't do anything wrong, she doesn't know what kind of shit is going to make someone else mad. It's up to him to control his own temper, maybe talk about it or laugh it off or something... maybe that's my issue with him, he seems quick to anger?

&gt;their relationship hasn't really been tumultuous until the Doctor shows up in The Caretaker

I guess it's hard to tell how long they've been dating since their interactions happen mostly off screen, so maybe that's another reason I feel this way. There hasn't been much on screen ""good times"".

&gt;The Doctor, by being superior and condescending and Clara for defending his behavior.

Again, his immediate reaction was to be angry instead of roll with it. You can't control other people, if The Doctor is being a dick why not just remove yourself from the situation? Seems to me like his pride won't let him let things go.

&gt;I think that Danny is an excellent character because he is not immediately taken in by the Doctor and doesn't immediately become enraptured by the idea that he is a Time Lord that can travel through time and space. Instead, he is quite willing to call him out on his BS.

I loved Donna specifically because she called out The Doctor for his BS, I don't care for the way this guy is doing it.

&gt;As for as your perception that he is about to yell or hit someone where he talks, I don't know where this comes from. In fact, Danny is quite soft-spoken and often seems almost emotionally numb

Maybe that's the problem, he seems numb until something sets him off and he gets angry... I didn't think about it this way until talking to you but maybe that's the root of it, he's not emotional except for anger and that kind of scares me.",0,1412382493,null,0,false,0,ckzukmr,t3_2i7wsi,t1_ckzukmr,t1_ckzu38o,null,1426694371,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Technically even some buddhists qualify as ""atheists"" although colloquially we don't call them that because they are still religious, if not having a belief in a god or gods. ""Atheism"" colloquially is just as much associated with having no religion. Although it is possible to be an atheist and still have supernatural beliefs, like say in ghosts.

Most people who self-identify as atheists are the kind of people who are generally skeptical of supernatural beliefs. Subscribing to a rationalist, evidence-based way of  looking at the world around them, or in other words a scientific view on all things.

However some atheists, like myself, also have a bit of a personal mission to speak out against the irrationality of organised religion, and the harm it contributes to from child rape to decapitations. Personally I am someone who was raised in a very hardcore version of christianity, and later in life I figured out it was all bullshit. I try to talk with people who are themselves evangelists to show them there is a more rational way of looking at nature and humanity.

Many people are atheists but don't call themselves that. For example a common used expression is someone saying they are ""agnostic"". But technically most atheists are agnostic, all that means is that you don't claim to have 100% knowledge that there is no such thing as a god. Agnostic is a position on knowledge, atheism is a position on belief.

Between self-identifying as atheist, agnostic and no religion the majority of British people under the age of 40 are atheists. Though not all self-identify as such since they think atheist means being anti-theist.

Atheism itself does not condemn anything as it isn't a belief system. It is just a rejection of a belief system, several of them technically.

No, I'm an atheist and I thus regard the entire Abrahamic anti-pork stance as utterly contrived and superficial, based only in a text.

It's just stupid that you're looking to take steps which have *no military value whatsoever* - it sounds like you're just trying to fulfil some personal revenge against these guys.

I mean, you can't *seriously* believe that desecrating the corpses of enemy soldiers would serve to *deter* people from joining their ranks? Fucking *really?* ***Did you even think about that for one fucking second?*** 

Tell me, how would the British public react if footage emerged of British soldiers' corpses in Afghanistan being mutilated, mocked, and desecrated by Taliban militants? Would that make us inclined to stop fighting them? Would people become *less* motivated to sign up for the army and fight the bad guys? Of fucking course not. 

Your genius strategy would have the opposite effect, and you don't need a degree in psychology to suss that out. So I don't believe that even *is* your reason for saying that shit.

It's been established that Gallifreyans colonized nearby planets. We had a whole story on the nearby planet of Karn where the Doctor said something about growing up in the neighborhood. It makes more sense for it to be a one of these colonies. In the 50th, the Daleks were in their final assault on Gallifrey so conveniently the whole fleet was together. It wouldn't make much sense for him to steal a WMD and then risk getting blown up by a Dalek saucer before actually using it. The surface of Gallifrey is supposed to be hellish at this point, not just a big empty clear skied desert and he wanted the chance to actually use the moment.

He didn't expect to survive because The Moment was expected to blow out a large chunk of the universe to save the rest.

With Listen, I took the implication to be that the Doctor spent time on one of the colonies as a kid... possibly in a children's home which would further the Danny comparison they are setting up and makes sense with the references to ""the other children""

Heck, it even explains why there was nobody around the barn because they were probably evacuated back to Gallifrey when the Daleks came close or the Daleks blew them up which explains the lack of housing. 

The fact of the matter is that the Time-War and Time Lock are left intentially vague so that the writers are not pinned down.

All these Wahhabi (Sunni jihadist) terrorist groups are pretty much bankrolled by Saudis. The Wikileaks cable release confirms this with US Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton's statement in 2009, ""Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support base for al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, LeT [Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan] and other terrorist groups.

It would probably be most effective to target the House of Saud despots. But is unlikely to happen, our leaders like to hold their hands in public, and of course the US is currently fighting proxy in a war against the Houthi Shia Rebellion in  Saudi backed Yemen.

See, I got the impression that his name wasn't readily available.  She tries to claim that she heard it at school, but he immediately dismissed that and says that he hasn't used that name in years.  It makes it seem like not even the people at school know the name Rupert.  If that is the case, then it would certainly be weird that she would know it.  

&gt; It's up to him to control his own temper, maybe talk about it or laugh it off or something... maybe that's my issue with him, he seems quick to anger?

Since we don't know much about his past, there might be a reason for why these particular topics set him off, something that we may find out as the series progresses.

&gt; if The Doctor is being a dick why not just remove yourself from the situation? Seems to me like his pride won't let him let things go.

I'm sure there is an element of pride in his actions.  Plus, to remove himself from the situation is to potentially remove himself from Clara.  He wants to stand toe-to-toe with the Doctor because to do anything less could potentially diminish him in Clara's eyes.  Further, as he says at the end of the episode, he has known and served under men like the Doctor and probably doesn't feel too inclined toward them.  

The difference between Donna and Danny is that Donna was the Doctor's best friend and saw the best parts of him as well as the worst, whereas Danny doesn't know anything about the Doctor other than what the Doctor reveals to him in their first interactions. These first interactions certainly don't do the Doctor any favors as he is nothing but rude and condescending to Danny.

Someone's head just got chopped off by a member of an organisation that wishes to setup a theocratic government.

""Proof yet again that religion is a serious mental illness.""

I am sure if he had gone away for a couple of hours and come back he might have replaced ""is"" with ""can be"". However I don't think anyone here was in the mood for PC language or an anthropological dissertation after watching the video. I know I was not.

Now we have a couple people going all ""Lol /r/atheism retards!"". Which by the way most of the atheists I know don't subscribe to that cesspit anymore than most of the gamers I have as friends subscribe to /r/gaming. And it has become a mess of insults, absolutist arguments and lots of apologetics for a fucking evil religion. Even if you completely discount ISIS as a minority radical group, the majority of muslims in the middle east are homophobes, misogynists, racists, intolerant of other religious views etc. etc. This isn't some cuddly Church of England we're talking about here.

Don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to defend that statement as some kind of perfect summation of all religion. But learn to use the fucking context!

That comparison to Messi isn't the best, because he's definitely a lot more versatile than just a false 9 or whatever. Messi'd play his way into the hole or on the wings. Can Soldado take over for Eriksen in that spot? How about Lamela or Chadli? In that system, Messi would be the one delivering the crosses to whatever monstrous 6'5 striker was on the receiving end of it. 

Like I said in another thread, there are very few top class out and out strikers left. Suarez, Lewandoski, Ibra, Aguero, Falcao and Costa all bring something else other than just goals. 

Nobody mentions that AVB buying one of the world's best poachers is fucking laughable in hindsight. People are quick to blast him and his tactics, but for a guy whose strategy against opposition couldn't penetrate a defense if it had two dildos, getting that kind of striker was just stupid.

false,basketballhater,newcr-1,Besic's new Lambo,"Q1)  There's no reason why United shouldn't be back in Europe next season.  I'd put them at 4th, especially since Liverpool (who I predicted to do decent this year) is doing so hilariously mediocre this year.  Everyone seems to think their problems will be solved by Struddige's return which I think is ridiculous, but that's a whole different subject that I won't get into.  As for Everton, for me 8th and above would be good.  Europa is a curse and a blessing at the same time.  Many clubs that showed great potential have crumbled beneath its weight.  If we managed to stay healthy, I'd put us at 6th, but as we can already see, that's not going to happen.

Q2)  I hate Wayne Rooney with a passion.  Everything from his hair restoration treatment to his supposed ""maturity.""  He has always and always will be a scumbag in my eyes, and I can't see for the life of me see why VanGaal made him captain.  It should have been Van Persie.  He is a player that I really like on that team along with Di Maria.  He's a clear world class talent and honestly United have been crying out for a player like that for a while now.  Falcao I think is very overrated.  A player of his calibre should easily break 20 goals this season, but I really don't see that happening.

Q3)  The Moyes thing I think felt like a trap.  Ferguson left him an aging, crumbling team that was out of its prime.  I wouldn't blame the inability to sign players completely on Moyes either; Woodward had a lot to do with it.  That being said, I think VanGaal will be the man to take them to previous heights.  His defensive management is lacking but he clearly knows what he's doing in attack.  My other criticism about him is his strategy of playing all of his weapons at once.  Sure an attack of Di Maria, Rooney, Van Perise, and Falcao, is very daunting but that leave no one to bring in off the bench and fatigue and injury will be huge problems for you guys as the season progresses.

Q4)  I'm a huge Martinez fan.  I was skeptical when we first signed him but he made a believer out of me and it'll take a lot more than a few bad results to change my mind.  Honestly, it really pisses me off how many people are criticizing him of late.  These were the same people who were piling on the praise last year when thing were going well and saying he's the best thing to happen to this club in a while.  As soon as thing start going bad, though, they completely changed their mind.  Give the man time to see which team works best.  I know that the pre-season is meant to do that but with the WC it was never going to feasible.

Q5)  As an American fan, I have no opinion of value about this.  I would love to watch a match in Goodison, but I realize that in order for this club to move forward we're going to need a new stadium.  I really hope I make it to at least one game before (if?) we move.

Q6)  Both our defenses are leaky so I expect something of a goal fest.  I don't mean to sound offensive but if Leicester can beat you by two goals, I think should should be able to eek out a win.  I anticipate 3-2 Everton.",0,1412392597,null,0,false,0,ckzyar4,t3_2i7hq9,t1_ckzyar4,t3_2i7hq9,null,1426692584,2,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,2

I'm technically a minority (but I'm white so I don't stand out until people learn a little more about me, or see my name on a form). All my life I've had people pointing out the fact that I am a minority in positive and negative ways, nothing major but enough to make me aware that people are putting me in a different box and treating me differently because of my blood and my name alone. So I have to assume that if it's like that for me, it must be a hundred times the case for people who do stand out because they are obviously a recent arrival (2-3 generations). And in a lot of cases, what were attempts to celebrate diversity by well meaning progressive types just serve to make that difference more pronounced. People asking you things like ""as a xyz, how do you view this?"" when you were born in the home counties and spoke RP as a child.

Secondly, there are no adventures left to be had. No going off into the unknown to make yourself. Everywhere has been discovered and put on the internet, and there is little to believe in. Going to fight a holy war in the middle east and establishing a new state is something that is exciting and interesting, especially if it gives you a cause and a group to be part of. Its kinds similar to being really into a brand, or a band or a type of phone. For some people, they need this to fill a hole in their lives.

Lastly, retro is cool. You can't really dye your hair and listen to strange music to make yourself different from your parents because your parents and probably grandparents have stories of doing the same things when they were a kid. It's not viewed as shocking and challenging, it's just viewed as a phase. So in some ways I view the way young Muslim kids find Islamic fundamentalism exciting in the same way that I view young white kids wearing tweed, growing a handlebar mustache and talking about cast iron cooking pans. Obviously a very different cultural background and motivations, but I think there is something in the idea of young people being attracted to ideas, ideals and concepts that they know their parents rejected.

How exactly was Siggy treated badly? He was outclassed in his preferred position and wanted to start elsewhere. Good for him that he's back at Swansea, because they seem to have a system that suits him well. The same might happen to Holtby, who knows. 

&gt;in that second band there are none more proven than Soldado.

Some people in this sub eat this kind of rhetoric up because of the ""lazy mercenary Ade"" narrative, but after the horrendous season he's just had, Soldado's a far cry from being a proven *PL* striker. Bony and Rod aren't proven to the point where they're known across Europe, but at least they've got a solid season in England. Soldado doesn't have even that. 

Offloading Soldado and getting J-Rod does two things. First, it gives us pace in the front line that none of our current three forwards have. Second, it gives us depth on the wings, and we're short in that department. So whether or not Rod is bought into Spurs to start or be benched, he offers something different that Soldado, Ade or Kane just can't. J-Rod not only offers all of the physical shit that Soldado, Kane and Ade don't, but he's already played under Pochettino. He'll have some idea of what to do the day he shows up, if he does at all. 

I'd wager that none of us have seen that Valencia side that Soldado played at. People haven't stopped banging the ""30 goal season at Valencia"" drum since he signed for us, but I'd love to get game-by-game stats. How many matches did he go goalless? Are the stats skewed by a number of braces/hattricks against weaker sides? How did Valencia play, and does it bear any familiarity with what Pochettino is selling to the players? 

Banking on Soldado to come good when he's been horrid is like trying to kill yourself with a water gun.

Capaldi embodies what I think The Doctor *should* be: A genius alien with (deserved) megalomania. The previous three Doctors were too human (the love interest with his Companions has always been a thorn in my side). He should be unable to relate to his companions on that level (I love his jokes about how frumpy Clara is). Capaldi has the perfect blend between wacky insanity and stern genius.

Specifically political Islam suggests that the West (as well as a lot of Muslims too) have a sickness that prevents God from reaching them. This allows them to dehumanise these people and slaughter them.

We are so low on confidence we fuck up the few chances we do create. Forwards will have to take more responsibility, dictate how the team moves in the attacking third and develop understanding. It seemed easy when we had all three last season, but they need to do it themselves rather than expecting BR to dictate every detail. He relies on the intellect of his players, specially forwards.    
Once we click, and Sturridge returns to health, we should see improvements for most of the players. Balo and Sturridge, Lallana/Hendo/Coutinho and Sterling playing them through, we have a lot of positives we just chose a shit time to integrate half of the starting 11.


It might go the way of those horrible couple of seasons we had previously and just keep getting worse, but I have huge optimism for tomorrows game. We will get decent amount of goals to start with and then use our subs properly to get even more. I want to see more from Markovic and Lambert this time around, more eagerness around the box and more ""bite"". No fucking passing 1v1 to someone else, just get the job done. Sterling will be tired as fuck, I hope he gets off after 45min if we are 2 goals up, other than that I don't expect much from him. Might get assit/goal if Sturridge is on. 


I want to see Balo dominating defenders, none of this nonsense about keeping it cool, some players can't do shit when they are too calm. Bully the defenders, if they get rough with the tackles get rough in the air etc. He went from taking a lot of responsibility at Milan to abandoning it when he came to Liverpool.

That doesn't mean the latter shouldn't be taken seriously. I think what PsychoCandy may be referring to is the subject of this article, i.e. that there aren't enough people being allocated to investigate child abuse images, all of which involve a real child victim. (I think this ties into a wider issue with cybercrime in general being overlooked for years, partly because both many politicians and many police officers lacked understanding and awareness of it). In particular, one thing that really stands out for me is that it's only until recently that CEOP was given the green light to actually go looking for such images. That was just a massive bureaucratic facepalm, which didn't occur in any other area of crime-fighting (no-one says to police officers ""you can't try to find drugs being offered for sale because possessing illegal drugs is illegal""!). However, even though they now have the legal ability to search for it, I'm not sure it's going to make much difference because they appear to be so under-resourced.

But also this is a global problem, with cross-jurisdictional issues, and I know that the problem with child abuse investigations not being treated seriously enough is far, far worse in some developing countries - Pakistan, for instance, where police often simply do not believe accusations of incestuous child abuse.

I hope and have a hunch that this Doctor will be pulling that leash in before this Season is over, and we will see this Doctor being fully himself, and less Clara's Mad Uncle.

The baby woke me up at 8.  Mrs Dwair got up briefly and has gone back to bed, leaving me literately holding the baby - who, quite frankly, is being a bit of a twat.

Its windy and wet, so there a washing machine load of wet stuff spread round the garden after it was left on the line overnight.

The ""on"" switch has disappeared in side the tumble dryer (where Mrs Dwair poked at it repeatedly with a spoon until it broke off) so in light of the failure to dry stuff yesterday, this needs fixing asap today.

The big dog has discovered cows in the field next door and doesn't like the look of them, so she is barking like a nutter at them.  This in turn has set off all the other dogs.

As rain and gales are forecast, my weekend plans for replacing all the widows in the porch have gone up the swanny.  The good news here though, is that the porch is full of prams, car seats, surfboards and car detritus so at least I don't have to find somewhere to put it all while I jack up the roof and put windows in.

I forgot to ask Mrs Dwair to get a primary ingredient needed for dinner tonight when she did the shopping so I need to go shopping.  As I live in the sticks, this is a 25 mile round trip and will take about an hour out of my life.  Probably longer as I will have to take the ""twat baby"" with me.

false,holformr,null,null,"Late in the afternoon of July 29, Morgan Schneiderlin, recently returned from his post-World Cup holiday, was sitting in an ante-room at St Maryâs Stadium, waiting for his meeting with Ralph Krueger, Southamptonâs recently installed chairman.

The 24-year-old thought that he had come to discuss his future. Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and the rest of the clubâs gems had already departed and Tottenham Hotspur were thought to be about to return with an improved, second offer for the France midfielder and Jay Rodriguez, his team-mate.

Schneiderlin had attended expecting to inform Krueger of his desire to leave. He had been ready to explain that he felt, after six years in which he had stood by the club as they descended to the third tier and then helped them to soar into the top half of the Barclays Premier League, that he was ready to move on, and that he believed Southampton owed him a gracious exit. He wanted a smooth, cordial goodbye.

Krueger, at that moment, was giving an interview to talkSPORT. He had a very different idea of what Schneiderlinâs future held. He informed the stationâs Drivetime show that neither player would be allowed to leave. He made it abundantly clear that the exodus that had ripped the heart out of the club was at an end. Krueger would take the same line when he and the player met. He would inform Spurs, too. There would be no move. Schneiderlin would be the one who stayed.

The player reacted furiously. As is the way of these things, he vented his feelings on Twitter. âSix years of an amazing journey [at Southampton] destroyed in one hour,â he posted. Almost immediately, it garnered 30,000 retweets.

At that point, it seemed unthinkable that Schneiderlin would be at White Hart Lane tomorrow to face a Spurs side managed by Mauricio Pochettino, his mentor, wearing a Southampton shirt, let alone that he would have emerged as one of the cornerstones of Ronald Koemanâs new-look team.

That impression was reinforced when, briefly, in the immediate aftermath of Kruegerâs interview, Schneiderlin absented himself from training. It looked inevitable that he would go on strike to force his move through, as though â unlike Lallana, Shaw, Calum Chambers, Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert â his departure would be a bitter, acrimonious one.

It is what happened in those few desperate days, though, that held the key to Schneiderlinâs remarkable renaissance this season.

First, Koeman acquiesced to the playerâs desire to take some time away from the club. As he told The Times last week, the Dutchman could empathise. After all, he would have been furious had PSV Eindhoven blocked his path to Barcelona in 1989. That delicate touch, and that understanding, would prove crucial.

Schneiderlin, in consultation with his childhood sweetheart Marie-CÃ©cile, took a weekend to assess his options. His affection for Southamptonâs fans was one significant factor. So, too, his inability to comprehend the reality of going on strike: he is, say those who know him, a football obsessive, the sort who would sleep with a ball if he could; and his hobbies away from the game do not stretch much farther than playing Fifa. The idea that he would not play football, and that he would not train, was anathema to him.

The decisive factor, though, was the same as the motivation to leave. Schneiderlin had felt that he would stand a significantly better chance of remaining in Didier Deschampsâs France squad if he was playing for a team either in the Champions League or competing for it. Spurs, where he knew not just Pochettino but also Hugo Lloris, his international team-mate, fitted the bill nicely.

But he could not take the risk of not playing at all. He had waited so long to be called up to his national side that he did not want to jeopardise his place. He decided that a long-term hiatus was not an option. He returned to work, determined that if he would not be playing for a top-six club, he would have to perform well enough to suggest that he really should be.

He has been good to his word. Schneiderlin has been an ever-present for Koeman this season, scoring three times â not bad, given that his career total is only 13 â in seven appearances.
He will renew his acquaintance with Pochettino this weekend safe in the knowledge that he has been named in Deschampsâs squad for next weekâs friendlies with Armenia and Portugal, too. He did not get the move he wanted. His momentum, though, continues unchecked.",0,1412412523,null,0,false,0,cl038g7,t3_2i9i7x,t1_cl038g7,t3_2i9i7x,null,1426690269,9,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,9

&gt;The investigation found the Egyptian government had ordered one million of the gadgets, while the Thai authorities are believed to have paid Â£25,000 for a single handle.

&gt;Officers said one Alpha 6, assembled out of plastic imported from China, was bought for Â£500,000.

&gt;The bogus contraptions were based on a novelty ""golf ball detector"" called the Gopher which sold for around $20 (Â£12) in the US.


wonder if this one like the past fraudster had backing from government departments, which is how countries thought it was more trust worthy

&gt;On Tuesday, Kent businessman Gary Bolton, 47, was jailed for seven years at the Old Bailey for fraud over the sale of thousands of devices based on novelty golf ball finders which he claimed could detect explosives and drugs but which detectives said were ""nothing more than plastic handles with aerials as antennae"".

&gt;In the aftermath of Bolton's sentencing, it can be revealed that the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the government's trade arm, UKTI, gave promotional, diplomatic and financial backing to Bolton over several years even though a Home Office expert in bomb detection equipment found his device's ability to detect explosives was no better than random. http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/20/government-fake-bomb-detectors-bolton

In and out in a couple weeks, massive casualties then leave again letting the Iraqi army hold the ground that was taken.


This worked fantastically last time. The Iraqi army has already shown it's useless. 

Giving ISIS what they want causes at the absolute very least two problems.

One being sending conventional armies into a guerilla theatre. It didn't end well last time and it won't end well again. All the training in the world doesn't prepare you for the real thing.

The second being the lack of an absolute plan for the end of conflict. Do forces stay or leave once ISIS has been eradicated or at least subdued or do we commit forces for the next generation to make sure no one else can rise in the vacuum? Do we leave &amp; then wait another five years and return when the next round of mentalist spastics rise &amp; spread their mentalist spastication?

I'm not against action completely but it isn't something or somewhere Britain can just jump into feet first again with no commitment. It's something that needs to outlive this government and the next and the next. I don't think I, or anyone,  should support military action unless it's a long term commitment. We broke Iraq and are at least partly the reason that it's in the mess it's in. We should be willing to commit to fix what we've broken.

Now this, this won't happen because it definitely isn't profitable and would require politicians to put the needs of people ahead of politics.

Qutb would have acquired followers and inspired the odd bombchucker here and there but it's highly doubtful that the ideology would have had the reach and impact it did and has had it not been for the Saudis and the likes of the CIA exploiting the groups cleaving to that ideology in order to fight a proxy war.  
  
It's genuinely bizarre that no-one bothered learning the lesson from what happened when the German High Command thought it would be a gee-whizz top-notch idea to smuggle a certain Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov into Russia in order to foment revolution and knock the Russians out of WW1 only to have Soviet tanks parked outside the Reichstag just thirty years later...  
  
Unfortunately, the current ascendancy resulting in IS is, in the more recent period, the direct result of the Saudis and Qataris (and to a certain extent Israel) deciding to exploit the Arab Spring to knock-over the Assad regime in Syria as part of the ongoing proxy war with Iran. And then you have the meta-conflict between the US and its allies against Russia to consider.

It is generally how it works with Doctor Who, when the Doctors and/or companions leave, the next Doctor just moves on with the next set of companions and the old ones only get a mention here and there at best. Sarah Jane Smith was one big exception from this when she was brought back by RTD. But during her time with Four he calls her his best friend. But once she's gone and he is with Leela, Romana, K-9 and so on, I don't think I even recall him mentioning him and I've only have got about the last two seasons with him unwatched.

Also Rose, Donna and Martha did even appear in Let's Kill Hitler for a bit, which is more than most of the previous companions got. Jack got mentioned and Moffat wanted him to be in A Good Man Goes to War, but there was a collision with the shooting schedule for Torchwood, so John Barrowman wasn't available at the time. Also 11 has even mentioned or refered to some of the clasic companions: In The Wedding of River Song when he tries to call The Brigadier and learns about his death, he mentions his granddaughter Susan in The Rings of Akhaten and Tegan (gobby Australian) in The Crimson Horror.  There's actually plenty of references to the past in Moffat's era, but the majority of them are very subtle and they tend to be more about Classic Who than about RTD, but personally I think that's good. We have all seen RTD's stuff, but most of the viewers haven't seen Classic Who or at least haven't seen all of it.

I think it's actually RTD's era that stucks out in this. He had an obsession of always bringing the characters back (Rose being the most glaring example of this) even though their stories were done.

If the Strikers and MIdfielders can act collectively to pressure City at their half and at the centre of the park, City will have no cards to play.

So can our front and mid put up constant pressure? The sad reality is no. During the Liverpool game, the pressure is good but during the Arsenal game, they let up after 20 minutes, allowing Arsenal to push up into our half. Against Chelsea, we turtled after they scored the first goal, letting their back line into our half. The only hope now is that City might be tired after their match against Roma.

So 5 at the back will be a disaster as defence starts at the front and turtling will only work for so long before they find the cracks.

As for scoring goals, forget about it. The Liverpool win is thanks to their horrid defending. If we constantly apply pressure to their backline and make the midfiled congested, Villa can manage a 0-0.

Possibly. Many Israelis still believe that Hamas can be defeated (or at least contained) through force, and Hamas still believes that asymmetric attacks on Israel will get them a better deal. Hardliners on both sides stand to gain politically from this. The parallels with NI are obvious.

As with Hamas, Israel needs to see a credible way forward. Risible as it sounds given their regional dominance, many Israelis feel insecure, and some of their politicians exploit this relentlessly.

We had an exceptionally good last season, but that was partly because teams underestimated us early on in the season, and partly because we had a pretty narrow fixture list and were pretty lucky with injuries. Whilst City lost Aguero for ages and Arsenal had their typical glass squad, we basically only had to cope with Suarez's ban at the start and losing Sturridge for a month or two in the middle of the season.

Last season we were only ever a few injuries to Suarez or a key midfield player away from being in trouble - our bench had absolutely nothing. This season we've at least got a bit of contingency but it was always going to take a bit of time to adjust to the five or six new players that we needed coming into the first team squad. This season people have complained that Rodgers has brought on the wrong player from the bench -  at least we *have* the players to bring on. 

The reason Rodgers said we weren't doing a Spurs was because we weren't overpaying and panic-buying anyone we could towards the end of the window after losing Suarez - we'd planned for it and set out our transfer targets accordingly. It had nothing about us avoiding a transition period because we were always going to face one. I don't think people expected us to get off to a start that's quite as rough as we have done, but I really don't think anyone with any sense was putting our targets as anything higher than a top four finish, and that's still perfectly doable from where we are if we improve a bit.

Related to this mismatch between atriker and midfield, I was thinking about the role of deep lying playmaker now that suarez has left. A striker being isolated is often used as a criticism, but its not necessarily so. Some forwards thrive on it - if you're isolated it usually means there's not many defenders around either, or theyre not well organised. Suarez thrived on this, quick passes forward for him to control or even just to fight for and run at or dispossess them one on one. Sturridge to some extent. When Gerrard or others can quickly and accurately move the ball forward to create these opportunities from deep, isolation is an advantage.

However when your forward prefers to receive simple balls to feet, draw defenders and bring others into play then isolation becomes a problem, and a deep lying playmaker becomes a disadvantage. The pay-off for having a deep midfielder with little defensive contribution is that his midfield colleagues shoulder that workload. Someone has to make tackles, interrceptions and track runs, and if his midfield colleagues are doing that there is no way they can also support the attack effectively. Having one or two midfielders doing workhorse roles is fine if you're happy to isolate your forwards as we were last season, but right now its a problem. Also, when your forward works best off simple balls to feet, Gerrard's range of passing becomes redundant as pretty much anyone can play those simple passes.

So, with Balotelli up front we would have been better suited to a destroyer DM (Lucas) which would free our other midfielders to support the attack more. A deep lying playmaker with a ""deep-lying forward"" is a mismatch.",0,1412420941,null,0,false,0,cl04i4w,t3_2i81xx,t1_cl04i4w,t3_2i81xx,null,1426689677,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I think the problem is that selling a whole block of flats to private buyers all at once will depress the price. One flat might sell for Â£250,000, but it would take months or even years to sell 100 at that price - all the while, the construction firm is losing money on their investment.

The trick to quickly selling the lot at a reasonable price is to tap into many different markets. Some on the London domestic property market. Some through a help-to-buy scheme. Some to big UK landlords. If there are people in HK who'll buy, them allocate some to them too.

If the local government wants to ensure that they all become available on the local property market, then they would probably need to get financially involved in some way.

No. Nice strawman.

&gt; You also make some pretty disgusting assumptions about a billion people you've never met

But it's not an assumption. For starters there's been a relevantly large number of opinion poles taken (in various different nations, including our own) on what Muslims think about about such issues as the morality of homosexuality, gay marriage, abortion, amongst others. They all show almost universal opposition. There's also been hundreds of polls set out to discern what percentage of people in pre-dominantly Muslim nations accept the theory of evolution. Again, those who believe the world was created in it's current form within the last 10,000 years is always well over 90%. I would prefer you made use of the google tool but i will rake and post if you insist.

For seconds, have you ever been to the Middle East, North Africa, Indonesia? Have you ever bothered to have a conversation with a Muslim about some of the above topics? I assume you haven't or i wouldn't need to bring up opinion polls, simple observation is quite enough. It's a rare thing to meet a Muslim whose social views are to the left of an American Republican's.

---
&gt;
&gt;___Grant Morrison's Doctor Who___ was a reprint comic book published in the United States by IDW Publishing beginning on October 2008. The comics were colourised by Charlie Kirchoff.
&gt;The two-issue mini-series reprinted three stories by Grant Morrison from *Doctor Who Magazine*. These were *The World Shapers* and *Changes* starring the Sixth Doctor and *Culture Shock* starring the Seventh Doctor, now in colour and with new covers from *Doctor Who Magazine*. IDW published the series during an interval in publishing its other reprint series *Doctor Who Classics*. 
&gt;The first issue was published with two variant covers: a standard cover showing the Seventh Doctor sitting in a chair beneath portraits of the Sixth Doctor, Frobisher, and the shape-shifting alien from *Changes*; and a ""retro incentive"" variant that featured an Andy Warhol-like montage of images of the Sixth Doctor and Frobisher.

false,sdtp,cnty-england,Southern Fairy,"Nothing in life is free; everything has to be earned one way or another. There's a documentary about a guy who moves to Alaska to live in the wilderness - he has to cut down all the trees to make his lodge, he has to source fresh water and haul it back to his shelter, he has to use ingenuity to hunt his food, and he has to rely on his hunt to make clothes. Obviously he has equipment that he has made/purchased beforehand, but he has still had to 'earn' everything he has with physical exertion, intelligence, adaptation, I could go on.

But the difference is, *anybody*, with enough determination, intelligence, preparation, and grit can go and do exactly as that guy did. There's not a man stood at the entrance of the wilderness who gives certain people entrance, but for other people he demands a down-payment of 1000 trees and 50% of their hunt for the rest of their lives.

The situation in London for anyone other than the wealthy is that they can't find employment in their industry outside of London, yet the property market makes it incredibly difficult to afford to live there and the cost of living is disproportionately high. So you can't afford to live there, fine. The other option? Commute! But that's a monopoly, too. Train services into London are crowded and unreliable, *incredibly* expensive, with costs continuing to rise 'in accordance with inflation' despite no equal increase in payrise, and no competition - nor a solution - that is likely to better the market in the foreseeable future. It's a clear case of gentrification.

Sure, I could move up north. I have no right to live where I live, and if I can't find work anywhere around here other than London I could try my luck up north, move away from my friends and family. It's just frustrating to see this shift - businesses and the wealthy buying up property in areas that people need to live to get to work, only to then rent that property at a manufactured and monopolised rate serving only to exploit people for profit. People *need* shelter, and to hold them to ransom for it is immoral in my opinion.

And due to the way the constituency map is drawn, they'll still get a substantial chunk of the vote, if not get voted in again, next May. It's sickening.

I'm unemployed, but even if I was the kind of self-made millionnaire that the Tories adore, I would be beyond disgusted at what they've done to this country in just four short years. I don't really care that Labour got us into the mess in the first place - there can be little doubt about it, but that doesn't matter. What matters is the sheer lack of common sense and logic upon which Tory policy is based. 

OK, we have a huge budget deficit which needs to be addressed, but what working, fair, sustainable economic model would ever be based on the concept of dealing with billions of pounds of debt by taking the repayments from those least able to afford to pay?

We have a jealous, selfish capitol city which generates most of the country's wealth, and the Tories have made it so that wealth can only increase there, while poverty, hardship and despair runs rampant through the 85% of the country that's not London. We hang on to the tidbits they throw at us, while the tiny minority of vocal supporters tell us we should be grateful for what we're getting, we should bow to the holy power of the dollar and sweat our blood and hope away in the name of prosperity for the 15% in their ivory towers.

Every safety net, every support structure, every charity, every aid organisation is being attacked and eroded by people who keep telling us they're helping us. Big Society took money and manpower away from charities and community run services, welfare reform took dignity and hope away from those with the least of either. Now we see Osborne and May take the right to reply away from anyone who dares to speak up.

And people still don't see what's happening and keep telling people off for spouting the old clichÃ© about how Orwell's ""1984"" wasn't supposed to be an instruction manual.........

false,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"roma are a special case, really. they've been playing a formless front six for a long time now (which makes it harder to defend against, because of the movement) and their press is different to most. it sort of resembles barca's actually. totti led the press, but he also dropped off the front line to make it 6v4 in midfield over and over again (like messi). he also gave them another playmaking option alongside pjanic (or xavi), so they couldnt just say ""ok, lets push a defender up and mark him out of the game"" without leaving space for one of roma's two wingers to exploit between the fullback and remaining centreback. mark totti, and pjanic makes the plays. mark pjanic, and totti does. mark both, and you leave a spare man in midfield.

you're not wrong when you say you can force city into long balls by pressuring their midfield and backline... but im not sure we have the right players for that right now. most teams in england dont, in fact. thats why city have been able to use the 4-4-2 without being outscored (despite some teams exposing its defensive shortcomings).

unlike roma, we dont have a playmaking forward, nor do we really have two wingers. if we tried to emulate roma, most likely city would just bypass us (like roma did to them until lampard came on, funnily enough) because there will be spaces between the lines or the backline will have to leave space in behind.

to me, it makes much more sense to apply the pressure in the middle. let them have the ball in their half. what are they gonna do with it there? and if they notice this, let them push their defence forward, thats effectively how we fucked them last season. the higher their defence is, the better that is for us. we have several ballwinners and pace up front, and all it takes is one tackle or interception and a quick ball forward.

playing to our strengths by defending in our own half with sheer physicality and looking for the quick counter is probably how it will go down. we might start aggressively because its a home game, but i cant see us maintaining it for 90 minutes (see: arsenal). id love to see us play like roma, for what its worth, but thats asking a lot of this group of players, imo.",0,1412425464,null,0,false,0,cl059kg,t3_2i6zrv,t1_cl059kg,t1_cl042q9,null,1426689322,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

false,_Sagacious_,num23,,"There's quite a few claims in this article that are simply wrong.

&gt;It is always the same with Spurs. Every season, the expectations at White Hart Lane are far higher than anything they can realistically achieve.

Spurs fans, for the whole, don't expect top 4 this season.

&gt;Breaking into the Champions League places is seen as their goal whoever is in charge but they have only managed that once and, realistically when you consider the competition, finishing sixth would be a good outcome for them.

We've been top 4 twice and a marginal points difference from it regularly,  and in the 11/12 season we rightly looked to make top 2 until Harry being linked with England ruined our season.

&gt;Saints were meant to be this season's crisis club after losing their manager and most of their best players in the space of a few weeks - I certainly did not see their good start coming and I tipped them to struggle.

This was always a very lazy view. Looking at the players they'd retained and brought it there was a strong argument that the squad had improved and landing Koeman for the manager's role was huge.

&gt;Yes, they thrashed a poor QPR side 4-0 in August but that is the only time they have looked a force in front of goal.

We were very unlucky to not score 3 or 4 against Sunderland with the chance we created and shots hitting the post/crossbar.

&gt;Emmanuel Adebayor has only got one goal from six Premier League starts this season but his place does not seem in danger.

Spurs fans are calling for Soldado or Kane to start and Ade surely only has another game or two to pick it up before they do.

&gt;[Kane] is not quite ready to start league games yet

He scored 3 games in a row at the end of last season when started in the league

&gt;It is no surprise Spurs are relying heavily on their midfield for goals, with Nacer Chadli top scorer on four

Chadli plays as a forward in our current system. His main role is scoring goals.

The thing is that [many of these landlords get very little return on investment](http://www.londonpropertywatch.co.uk/average_rental_yield.html) when you consider the costs involved, stamp duty, ground rent, etc.

Preventing people buying property to let would not help prices at all, it's simply one of a lack of supply and high demand.  Having many people being landlords means that rents should be lower, renting is great as it's a fixed cost, surprises don't need to be met, but very flexible.

I've always said the first thing I'd do if I became ""rich"" would be to buy property and rent it out, though by no means am I an expert on finance or investment or any of this sort of thing. It's just a smart move. If I'm only a successful musician for 5 years, make it big for a while, but royalties start drying up, investing in property is a good way to secure a future income and make money. Since property is so expensive, you obviously need to already have a lot of money before you can buy it. 

So if my future millions aren't a guarantee, it would be a smart idea to bury my money in property whilst I've got it and before I lose it. Being a landlord is a good way to stay rich or get rich, of course people are gonna want to do it. But since most people can't afford to buy property, only the rich are able to. 

My last landlord inherited the house when his mother died, converted it into flats, and that basically funded his alcoholism! Since he was retired I think he relied on that income a lot. So there will be various kinds of people contributing to the problem; people who buy property as a game of monopoly like this, people who come into a bit of money and want to invest it wisely so they have security of a future income for kids etc...

You're unlikely to be due anything for this year unless the process has changed since real-time-reporting, as you could get a job next February and earn enough to cross the threshold. If not, you would be due a rebate as of April 2015. Real time reporting means your employer now tells HMRC about its payments as they are made, so HMRC should already know you're out of work.

Also, life-pro-tip: don't opt out of any employer-matched pension, as its essentially a free pay rise equal to the employer contribution rate. You're welcome to avoid paying more than the minimum, though the rule of thumb is to make sure your total retirement savings are ""half your age as a percentage from when you start"" e.g. if you start now (with a similar job), you would be well-advised to put away 11% of the Â£15k, whereas if you wait until 27 it might 13.5% of Â£25k (instead of still 11% of 25k).",0,1412429879,null,0,false,0,cl068nw,t3_2i9tse,t1_cl068nw,t3_2i9tse,null,1426688867,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

The US plan was in fact a pretty good compromise given the situation. We'd been contemplating a transfer of sovereignty until the invasion, and the Americans didn't consider it feasible to retake the Islands by force. 

Crucially Thatcher agreed to the plan, and it was the Argentinians who refused to co-operate.  Now what would Regan have done if Thatcher hadn't agreed?

false,iAesc,null,null,"TL;DR try sleeping less. You might not need 8 hours.

I had a terrible sleeping pattern before. Never awake in the AM. Even as a kid I always missed at least part of the first lesson at school. Just never able to sleep, and felt like shit whenever I woke up.

University didn't help at all, it just gave me an excuse to sleep longer. Stay up until 7am playing video games with my flatmates and then crash until 4 in the afternoon.

Having a job now in a pub kitchen/takeaway place, where sometimes I start in the AM, sometimes I finish in the AM, I've found that the adjustment wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be.

But the real reason I want to post is because of my discovery, which made this much simpler to me. The reason that I always struggled with the 8-hour sleep pattern is because my body doesn't function with that requirement. 
If I get eight hours, I wake up groggy, dead to the world, sleep through alarm clocks, late for work, tired and irritable all day.
If I get six hours, I wake up full of energy, ready to tackle the world, full of confidence and vitality.

My advice to you would be to experiment with your sleeping patterns, because from the sounds of it, you're just like I was. So try each day to get up a little earlier, until you hit the sweet spot. You might find that you only need six hours as well. Maybe even four. But obviously don't take a single positive result as a definite answer, try it for a few days.
If you have an Android (possibly iphone too), there's a good app called [Sleepytime](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icechen1.sleepytime&amp;hl=en) which you can use to calculate your sleep and wake schedule to give you a required amount of sleep.

You'll adjust. And if it's difficult, just be on the lookout for other work at all times. Working your arse off with no time for play is a good way to save money, but not a good way to make a living.

Furthermore Eriksen and de Jong often drifted out wide when Ajax's wingers cut inside.

Many Danes had high hopes for a Boilesen/ Fischer/Eriksen left side, that was crushed because of injuries.

Btw. i also think that Eriksens defensive abilities is better than people think they are. It has become some sort of a ""myth"" in England, because he is very rubbish defending out wide. He rarely defended out wide before he joined us.

YouTube video brainwashing but with a lovely dose of religious fanaticism, 2000 year apocalypse in the making fantasy, and all of that heavy cult stuff but what makes it extra potent and dangerous unlike the other crazy worldviews people get brainwashed into online or at meetings is it's effectiveness in the exploitation of pre-existing and powerful religious frameworks and cultural prejudices which make it more relatable and believable to people which cults like the Manson family or the Wearhermen never had, but ISIS and the KKK do 

I think like all cults they prey on the disenfranchised, the disillusioned, the bullied, the friendless and the vulnerable like you said but unlike other instances of this there is already a pre-existing religious belief which makes them more vulnerable to the tactics because it has a strong foundation to exploit and they can frame it all in a pre-existing frame work which makes it more relatable to the billion or so who already passionately subscribe to that worldview; it sneaks it's way into their house by dressing up as someone they recognise and can trust 

I think it's just the Manson family if the Manson family somehow managed to exploit Christianity or Islam or some other religion many people subscribe to in order to make their paranoid delusional fantasy about race wars and the apocalypse more relatable to potential recruits like the vulnerable or mentally ill or the disenfranchised, bullied etc. 

People like the Manson family or the Weathermen or the NWO illuminate conspiracy guys or Anonymous or the Columbine Killers can't frame their Ideologies in pre-existing and powerful religious narratives or cultural prejudices which make it familiar, relatable and believable and makes people who are religious more vulnerable to their tactics, but people like the KKK or ISIS can, and what makes them so successful compared to other cults is their ability to exploit pre-existing passions and prejudices by framing it in a familiar and relatable narrative as well as a lot of exposure and a lot of money.

This, in my eyes almost renders CU pointless (eg: no savings interest and HIGH loan rate for those emergencies).

It's a tough call, when you don't  have the money available something always comes along to ruin your day, from our calculations we would need 9 months to get completely out of CC debt and say another 3 to have some savings again (although that would be for other debts) - 12 months is a long time for many things to go wrong...

Please don't get me started on Holtby. I would pump out novels on this kid, backed up with stats in germany...videos...quotes about how important his contributions were to Schalke (a team arguably on par with us, with CL football)...and he was let go for peanuts. He just wasn't ever played in the right position - I hope (sorry Hamburg) that they get relegated and he comes back. No, it's not just his ''social media'' presence. If you watched Schalke &amp; German football like I did - you'd understand. Also, his German u21 CAPTAIN matches. Nobody performed particularly well for us during the managerial upheaval - so singling him out seems unfair. 

I would take him back in a heartbeat. And like you said - he fits that perfect AMC pushing from the front system. He isn't a MC, or DMC - nor does he have the discipline or stamina (and understandably so) to press for 90 minutes from deep. But from AMC with a free'er role with 2 MC's behind him? He would be a MASSIVE threat. Even if he played second fiddle to Eriksen, or we played Eriksen - Holtby - Lamela (my ideal line up) 

Fucking ludicrous we let him go. Sure, he never showed consistency for us, but he had his moments and seemed to be getting something going with Lamela in the Villa game back in December last year. Check out his one assist for Fulham vs Utd - AVERAGE players do not have this vision or passing ability. Some assists have been beautiful. But then Townsend is allowed to get away with providing NOTHING for 25 games while Holtby wasn't as valued and played a bit part role. 

I'm still bitter, as you can tell. This is the kid that kept Meyer and Draxler out of their preferred positions IIRC (could be wrong, Schalke fans may tear me down) - although playing devils advocate they were younger.

Hmm, it gets three stars on Boots.com. Out of seven that's a bit shoddy.

&gt;But decided I have enough nudes, golds and brows already!

No such thing! The next thing I'm on the hunt for is a palette of greys and blacks. I'd like some mattes in it. Most of mine are shiny. I love shiny but sometimes you want to go serious, right?

&gt;Agree about the packaging, but yes I can't do purples :(

I don't think I have the face to carry purples off.

&gt;Which foundation do you use? 

I don't do premium anymore. Firstly because money, and secondly what I use is far better than Laura Mercier or anything else I've tried. I use Revlon's Colorstay foundation with a dollop of [Benefit's High Beam](http://imgur.com/xteFjc8) mixed in. I tried High Beam on the cheekbones but it frankly looked ridiculous. It gives the skin a lovely glow if you use a small amount. My powder is Rimmel's Stay Matte and it's great; again, I prefer it to the Â£35 Mercier! My auntie told me my skin looks like porcelain the other day so it must be working for me.

&gt;She's huge! I'm excited for her but wow she is pretty uncomfortable now!

Aww, kids are great fun, especially when you can hand them back. I miss my nephews being 4 and 8.

&gt; This is how we played last year when we played well and looked like we had an objective, but maybe wouldn't get the result. Problem is now that we've wasted all these past games playing shit, without an objective in sight, AND not getting the result. Coutinho is fucking killing it, Hendo is fucking killing it, and Gerrard is finally playing the tactically-sound role he did last year. Sterling though also seems to kind of be playing like his last year's self, losing possession needlessly.

&gt; Whatever happens this match if we continue to play like this I'll be happy and surprised we don't get a goal here or there. Especially after Lambo is subbed out after all his hard work pressuring the defenders.

&gt; Edit: forgot to add how great Lallana has been as well. Running around like Hendo with the creativity and control like Cou.

&gt;

&gt;__LARC-V__ (Lighter, Amphibious Resupply, Cargo, 5 ton), is an aluminium-hulled [amphibious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_vehicle) cargo vehicle capable of transporting 5 tons. It was developed in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) during the 1950s, and is used in a variety of auxiliary roles to this day.

&gt;In addition to the United States, Larc-Vs have been used by military forces in [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia), [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina), [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal), [The Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philippines) and Iceland. Approximately 968 were made. About 500 were destroyed, most by scuttling during the American withdrawal from [South Vietnam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam). About 200 have been retained in US military service, Roughly 100 are privately owned and mostly used for tourism operators including a number of LARC vehicles is in use on Iceland for tourist trips on the [JÃ¶kulsÃ¡rlÃ³n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6kuls%C3%A1rl%C3%B3n) ice lake and four LARC-V's used in [Halifax, Nova Scotia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax_Regional_Municipality) for city and harbour tours.

He wasn't played as a DM or a CM (or on the wing) that often. Most of his playing time came in CAM. Fulham fans liked him to begin with, but by the end of the season, they saw flaws in him. 

Most of his good performances for us came in the europa-league group stages, and he tended not to be able to translate that into particularly impressive performances in the league.

I agree with you that sending him out on loan but not Paulinho is a bit harsh, but tbf this way he's seeing more game-time than Paulinho, so it probably serves him best.

Considering the purpose for prohibiting a substance is to severely limit it's use, I don't understand how people can proclaim it's a total failure given we have relatively low levels of use compared to legal substances, and that use is falling.

Tobacco, as heavily regulated, taxed, and frowned upon as it is, is more commonly used than Cannabis. [Over 20% of the UK adult population smoke tobacco](http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_93.pdf), compared to 6% of 16-59 year-old's that have used Cannabis in the past year.

Overall, I thought we played solid. You can tell our offense is starting to come together, linking up pretty well in the middle of the second half with quick one touch passing. Midfield was good, but I thought we didn't control the game as well as we could've liked. Defense was a bit shaky, could have been a lot worse than just the penalty (which was outside the box, bullshit call).

Lambert and Balotelli looked good, they has their chances. However, their job is to create and score goals, and they need to step it up.

Lallana and Henderson were work horses this game, as expected, they seemed to be everywhere. Glad they both got goals, I thought they deserved them, and both of them could've easily had another goal or an assist. Coutinho looked creative at first, but I can understand how he's struggling to get back into form. Also, it must be hard to adjust from having quick, inventive strikers in Suarez and Sturridge to changing to Lambert and Balotelli. 

Sterling seemed a bit off, I thought, at least in the first half. His touch seemed to escape him and he wasn't taking on people as much as normal. Needs to get some rest. Speaking of rest, Gerrard had a solid performance but I think he needs to take a game or two off. He controlled the midfield and even went up with the offense a few times. Still, he;s getting old and can't keep playing every game.

Of the defense, the only standout thing was how badly Lovren was playing. Almost every single chance WBA had was created off of Lovren's marker. Be it a cross, corner, or a free kick, he seems to struggle on set pieces.

Man of the Match: Lallana hands down for me, amazing performance from him. Was everywhere and created the most of any other player, it seemed. This guy never gets tired.",0,1412437976,null,0,false,0,cl08v8d,t3_2ia71v,t1_cl08v8d,t3_2ia71v,null,1426687628,33,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,33

-Raheem looks burnt, his touch for the second match straight was shocking, poor lad, hopefully Woy doesn't run him into the ground on international duty. 
  
  
All in all very happy with 3 points and hopefully the month of September was a one off and we continue the confident play after the break. ",0,1412438303,null,0,false,0,cl0900k,t3_2ia71v,t1_cl0900k,t3_2ia71v,null,1426687566,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1
