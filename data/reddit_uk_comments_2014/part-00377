&gt;__Estimates of the casualties from the conflict in Iraq since 2003__ (beginning with the [2003 US invasion of Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_US_invasion_of_Iraq), and the ensuing [occupation and insurgency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-invasion_Iraq,_2003%E2%80%93present)) have come in many forms, and the accuracy of the information available on different types of [Iraq War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War) casualties varies greatly.

&gt;For troops in the U.S.-led [multinational coalition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_force_in_Iraq), the [death toll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_toll) is carefully tracked and updated daily, and the names and photographs of those killed in action as well as in accidents have been published widely. A total of 4,491 U.S. service members were killed in [Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq) between 2003 and 2014.  Regarding the Iraqis (see Tables section below), however, information on both military and civilian casualties is both less precise and less consistent. Estimates of casualty levels are available from reporters on the scene, from officials of involved organizations, and from groups that summarize information on incidents reported in the news media.

&gt;The word ""[casualties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualty_(person\))"" in its most general sense includes the injured as well as the dead. Accounts of the number of coalition wounded vary widely, partly because it is not obvious what should be counted: should only those injuries serious enough to put a soldier out of commission be included? Do illnesses or injuries caused by accidents count, or should the focus be restricted to wounds caused by hostile engagement? Sources using different definitions may arrive at very different numbers, and sometimes the precise definition is not clearly specified.

false,Wolf75k,scot-Aberdeen,"Aberdeen, Scotland","&gt;  Iraq and Afghanistan have proven that the civilised military intervention just made things much much worse.

That's the narrative that's pushed, but is it true?

First lets look at Afghanistan. Nobody knows what it's going to be like in 5, 10, 50 years but if you think it's worse now than it was in 2001 you need to reopen the history books. The country was governed and run by the same sort of people that run ISIS today, beautiful thousand year old Buddha statues carved into the mountainside were blown to bits because they were seen as heretical. Women were banned from going to school, women who defended themselves from assault were publicly executed. Sharia law was enforced in it's fullest. Today Afghanistan is similar to any other poor country. Yes it has a shitload of problems but the Taliban are consigned to the countryside, children are free to be educated, the groundworks of democracy exist and people are generally free to live their lives without fear of being harassed, killed or maimed by fanatics.

As for Iraq that's a slightly different story. Unlike Afghanistan most people including myself were fundamentally opposed to it from the beginning. Saddam was a brutal dictator no doubt but unlike folk like the Taliban and ISIS his brain worked on the same wavelength as ours, he could be reasoned with and generally wanted the same things as anybody would want for their country (to be rich, powerful and successful). I'm not convinced at all that replacing a dictator with democracy in a country at that level of development was worth it but what's done is done. As to more recent developments i've actually been pretty optimistic over the last month or so. Mosul was a disaster and should not have been allowed to happen but since then ISIS have failed to make anymore gains. In fact they seem too be steadily losing ground on all fronts. It was never going to be easy but if this war is a test then Iraq seems to be passing.",0,1418529028,null,0,false,0,cmu9oga,t3_2p6ruu,t1_cmu9oga,t1_cmtyuii,null,1425444763,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

false,joebroon,null,null,"UKIP's turmoil in Scotland deepened last night after the right-wing anti-immigrant party suspended five senior members from its approved list of candidates.

The individuals - including the former Scottish leader and chair - are critics of party MEP David Coburn, prompting accusations of ""control freakery"".

UKIP was last week rocked by allegations of sexual harassment against party general secretary Roger Bird, who was accused of making inappropriate suggestions to a potential female candidate.

However, a lingering row is also continuing to hamper the party north of the border.

Last year, six of UKIP Scotland's shortlisted candidates for the European election withdrew after believing a small clique of activists was planning a takeover.

The botched selection contest was eventually won by Coburn, who was later elected to the Brussels Parliament and became the party's first elected representative in Scotland.

Two of the six members have since quit the party, and the other four - Christopher Monckton, Mike Scott-Hayward, Paul Henke and Ross Durance - have now had action taken against them.

Matthew Richardson, the UKIP party secretary, recently informed the quartet that they could not be party candidates in future elections.

He wrote: ""Having investigated your case in greater depth with the Party Chairman, he has taken the decision to suspend you as an approved candidate under 12.2.1 of the constitution as he considered that your withdrawal from the candidate list during the selection process for the European elections was disruptive to the Party and brought it into public disrepute.""

Each member was told that ""you are not therefore a suitable person to be a candidate for the Party in the future"".

The fifth candidate curb was imposed on Donald Gatt for alleged ""published comments"" following the European selection contest.

Monckton, who used to front UKIP Scotland until he was sacked by party leader Nigel Farage, is believed to have arranged a meeting for the suspended candidates in Edinburgh today.

Scott-Hayward, a former party chair, told the Sunday Herald: ""It is totally undemocratic and is totally out of line with the party's principles.""

He added: ""I consider that I failed in my tenure as their Chairman in that I did not achieve one of my objectives which was to alter the balance of membership away from the wilder and more extremist thinkers towards a greater number of sensible, right thinking folk who do indeed support UKIP's main policies.""

His party membership lapsed in the last few days.

Henke, who has stood for UKIP eight times in elections, was previously suspended for 100 years by the party for speaking to the media.

This ban was lifted following a court challenge.

UKIP Scotland's current chair is Misty Thackeray, who was revealed by this newspaper to have accused Glasgow City Council as being for ""Gays, Catholics [and] Communists"".

He is now Coburn's chief of staff. One party source said of the suspensions: ""It's about helping David and Misty. It's control-freakery.""

A UKIP spokesman said: ""It is a pity, but they wanted to be the message, rather than represent the party. They were divisive and had no concept of teamwork.""

A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: ""UKIP is clearly not competent nor credible in Scotland. The party has consistently failed at by-elections, and binning five of its prospective candidates won't help that.

SNP MEP Alyn Smith said: ""The ongoing shambles of UKIP in Scotland continues - at this rate they'll have no candidates left to stand in north of the border.""",0,1418532233,null,0,false,0,cmuavem,t3_2p8hvz,t1_cmuavem,t3_2p8hvz,null,1425444207,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2

It seems to be a few more than that. MUFC put up with Wes Brown's shenanigans early in his career but even they thought Morrison was too much. The recent incident where he was found not guilty of threatening to throw acid at his girlfriend and her mother may have unsettled some at the club. Finally I agree with /u/similarfunction in that he seems not to make too many friends in the dressing room and we have an amazing 'esprit de corps', built up carefully since the championship really, which is why I have no problem with Nolan in the squad as he seems central to that (That said I wish he'd play less with the other talent we have!)

I hope Morrison gets his shit together. He's a really talented young man and I'd love to see him play for us but it seems not to be the right time.

---

&gt;

&gt;__Three points for a win__ is a standard used in many [sports leagues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_league) and [group tournaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament#Group_tournaments), especially in [association football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football), in which three (rather than two) points are awarded to the team winning a match, with no points awarded to the losing team. If the game is [drawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie_(draw\)), each team receives one point. The system places additional value on wins with respect to draws such that teams with a higher number of wins may rank higher in tables than teams with a lower number of wins but more draws.

&gt;Many leagues and competitions originally awarded 2 points for a win and 1 point for a draw, before switching to the three points for a win system. The change is significant in league tables, where teams typically play 30-40 games per season. Teams that win roughly 50% of their games are the most affected by the point system. However, some league championships have been decided on the difference in draws among teams.

The easy answer has been given,the writers or specifically Moffat haven't figured out how to bring back Gallifrey yet.  

Mst3k rule 

This thread imo qualifies for the mst 3k rule (....and other science facts just repeat to yourself it's a show and I should really just relax) still, it is good to ponder on, I will jump in 

Time lords fear paradoxes.  While the telepathic circuits could bring the Doctor back on his own timeline he hasn't actually found Gallifrey.  If he does anything to alter that fact, ie; leave himself the coordinates,or worse advert them being frozen in the first place, he would create a massive paradox.  

But wait, what about going into the future along the Doctor's timeline?  Go to the day of the happy homecoming and bam! Gallifrey found!

false,Shazza193,null,null,"Hey buddy, I did this very recently - although I bought a 3 bed end of terrace for a bit more than 150k. I think it is absolutely a good idea looking at your financial situation (what you put on the post).  I personally prefer a house to a flat but you seem switched on and I assume know some of the risks of buying a flat, such as the service charges that would be due and may be quite high.  

Breaking it down, given your deposit, say 45k, you'd need to borrow 105k which is at the top end of the general 5 X salary, you'd need approximately 4k for searches, fees and SDLT (500 after Georgie's autumn statement) so you'd need about 50k all in. With the numbers you'd have a loan to value of 70% bang on. Ideally you want 69% (Wahey!) as the best rate is for under 70% ltv.  If you can save up another grand for that or ask your parents for it just to bring you under.

You pay 8k a year in rent, that's 660-680 pm. My mortgage is 460pm on 69% ltv. So not only would you be making capital repayments on a flat you own rather than rent, you may well be paying a noticeable sum less.

I also live in the south - not sure if it's classed as South west so much but whatever. I also had a similar wage when I did the mortgage.

I think if you are willing to take the risk and responsibility of ownership then it is a brilliant idea. I fucking love owning my own home!!!! 

On a side note, when I mortgaged I found Santander offered some of the best rates, and so (if not already) you should open a Santander 123 current account at least 30 days before a mortgage application as you'd then pay lower arrangement fees for a mortgage with them. I'm with Halifax as they lent me the amount I needed but I had to pay survey fees, Santander cover the cost themselves for that.

I don't know of a single employer who pays mileage here in the UK, its all hourly rate, salary or basic pay plus percentage of wagon earnings.

But thanks for telling us about US truck driving in a UK sub-reddit although I'm not quite sure how you thought it could be relevant. :-D",0,1418547143,null,0,1418547853,0,cmuf3n3,t3_2p5ccw,t1_cmuf3n3,t1_cmtp31t,null,1425442164,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

&gt;31. Can I be a done if I have an existing medical condition?
&gt;Yes, in most circumstances. Having a medical condition does not necessarily prevent a person from becoming an organ or tissue donor. The decision about whether some or all organs or tissue are suitable for transplant is made by a healthcare professional, taking into account your medical history.

&gt;There is only one condition where organ donation is ruled out completely. A person cannot become an organ or tissue donor if they have, or are suspected of having, CJD. In very rare cases, the organs of donors with HIV or hep C have been used to help others with the same conditions. This is only ever carried out when both parties have the condition. All donors have rigorous checks to guard against infection.

Now I know mrs_walter_peck was been told she isn't allowed to donate blood/organs and she doesn't have anything from that list.

Equally interesting; 

&gt;34. Are there religious objections to organ and tissue donation?
&gt;No, none of the major religions in the UK object to organ and tissue donation and transplantation. If you have any doubts, you should discuss them with your spiritual or religious adviser.

false,buried_treasure,null,null,"Before decimalisation (1971), money was complicated.

You had one pound (£).

It was subdivided into 20 shillings (s).

Each shilling was divided into 12 pence (d).

Seeing as a pound was quite a lot of money, unless you were making a large purchase such as a house or a car you'd not generally be dealing with it in the shops. So most things were priced in a combination of shillings and pence.

If something cost X shilings and Y pence, it was usually written X/Y and  pronounced ""X and Y pence"", or sometimes just as ""X and Y"".

So if something was priced at 3s8d, the sign on the goods would be written ""3/8"", and when you went to pay the shopkeeper would say ""that'll be three and eight, please"" or possibly ""three and eightpence, please"".

Beyond these basics you had other denominations of coins.

A single penny could be further subdivided into four farthings, although by the time the Second World War rolled around a farthing was already such a small amount of money that few people actually used them.

The coin that was worth 3d was known as a ""thruppeny bit""; the coin worth 6d was (naturally enough) a ""sixpence"", and also nicknamed a ""tanner"". The one shilling coin was commonly called a ""bob"" (often used in plural but never pluralised, e.g. you might have said something cost ""six bob"", meaning 6 shillings).

There was a coin which was worth two shillings and six pence (i.e. 1/8 of a pound) and this was known as a ""half crown"". It was the largest denomination coin in general circulation. Crowns also existed, being worth 5 shillings, but they weren't commonly used and were often only issued as special commemorative coins (rather like modern £5 coins). A crown was occasionally nicknamed a ""dollar"" due to the fact it was worth a quarter of £1 and for many years the £-$ exchange rate was pegged at four US dollars to one pound sterling.

A pound, as previously mentioned, was a lot of money, so you'd be unlikely to be carrying a pound note around unless you were wealthy, or planning a major purchase.

A guinea is a bit special. It's never existed as an actual denomination, nor for the last few hundred years as an actual unit of currency. It's worth 21 shillings (i.e. £1 and 1s) and has traditionally been used as a unit of currency only when buying and selling livestock, especially racehorses. Even today in the 21st century, British racehorses are priced in guineas, although there's still no such thing as a guinea coin, a guinea note, you can't write cheques in guineas and you can't transfer guineas in or out of bank accounts, because they don't actually exist!

You re making a lot of assumptions about the bakery. Why do you think they don't support gay rights? What are 'gay rights?' There are gay people who don't support homosexual marriage and I'd think there are rights that gay people want other than homosexual marriage.

You're alsofalsely accusing them of refusing to serve a customer. They never did that. They refused to provide material supporting a message they disagreed with, but that's diffenrent to refusing to serve a customer. I'm not aware of a gay person being told they can't buy a sausage roll.

And why can't they involve their worldview in their business? Do you think that all business owners should be amoral and leave behind their ethical framework when they begin work? That sounds like a ghastly idea.

It would be discrimination to not employ you unless there was a religious function to the job. Who has argued otherwise? If you were contracted to promote an ethos, then you should promote it. The alternative would be to not accept the contract. That sort of choice is what business owners should also have: to decline a contract that would go against their ethics.

I don't see why religion should be private. Religion defines people's entire approach to life. Freedom of religion is a fundamental right. It's something of an anomaly in human history that we have nations where people would say that religion shouldn't define your approach to life. By saying that the most important, defining feature of life shouldn't be expressed in public is effectively outlawing it and is gross discrimination.

If you try hard enough, *anything* can be reduced down to an issue relating to EU membership.

Road congestion? Remove the immigrants. Improve NHS waiting lists? Remove the immigrants. Overhaul the education system? Remove the immigrants.

It's hard to nail down UKIP policy, because they go through a cycle of coming up with policies, people actually reading their manifesto and realising how batshit insane they are, then scrapping the policies and starting over.

* roll of cat5E

* suitably-sized and coloured cable clips

* rj-45 crimp tool

* crimp-on modular rj-45 connectors

* basic network cable tester
 
(additionally, for a more permanent installation) :

* back-boxes (surface mount or flush-mount depending on how much chiselling you want to do)

* modular faceplates

* modular rj-45 sockets

* IDC/Krone punch-down tool


First of all you need to plan the cable route - easiest is just running it along the top of the skirting board. Think about the best route for avoiding going up and over doors. It also can end up looking a little messy if you run multiple cables together this way.

Hard-mode is to pop up a floorboard or two and run them under the floor (this is what I did when I bought my house a couple of years ago). If you're going to this effort then I'd recommend doing the ""proper"" installation technique of thinking about where you might want network sockets in the future and installing a few extras.

Regardless of whether you go above or below the floor, you can either terminate the cable in a standard network jack (with either enough flex at the end to reach your device or you can extend off with a rj-45 coupler to a standard network cable), or you can fit sockets to the wall (looks much better, much more robust, requires more permanent installation).

Any installation will require a central point to where all your cable runs come where you can locate the switch. I went for hard-mode and ran them all up to the loft where I've got a server rack with a patch panel. Depending on how many cables you have, you could either just have the dangling tails plugged into a switch mounted on the wall/under your desk/on the floor, or terminate in a mini patch panel such as [this](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Cat-6-Ethernet-Patch-Panel-12-Port-Stp-Shielded-Gray-/161480953431).

(*the reason for patch panels and sockets is that you're not mechanically stressing the hard-to-replace installed cable and you're only flexing the easily-replaceable patch cable*)

Once you've planned your approach, the techniques you will need to know/learn are

&gt;For myself, I tried to think why not France. But the French law is closed. When you come to France, they are happy to take information about you but if you have connections in other EU countries, they didn’t want to know about you anymore. I was put into jail in Paris, but when I said I had lived in Italy, they stopped the interview. Italy treats you really badly. If I had my human rights there, I would have stayed. There is nothing, so you have to leave. In other countries, they deport you to Italy, in France, you just have 5 days to leave.

&gt;When you try to ask asylum in France, you have to write a statement on why you left your country. But you sleep in the street, you don’t eat, how can you write it and wait 4 months for the answer while sleeping in the street? There is no access to legal system. All they do is giving you advice but you never meet a solicitor, someone interviewing you. There is no immediate housing support.

&gt;When I’ve been to Italy, most North African (Algerian, Moroccan) want to go to Spain because they have family there and speak Spanish. People from Cameroon and Senegal want to go to France because they speak French and have connections in France.

And another on the mentality of the French authorities,

Sending in a modest few hundred troops to help Kurds, Yazidis and the Iraqi Army with training and security is a very achievable goal. And if you look through the history of successful counterinsurgency interventions, the best examples (except Malaya) have always used a modest, local force led approach. Sierra Leone for example, we sent in a small force that beat back the RUF and helped government forces win. 

No one is trying to reclaim the whole of Iraq and build the country again, but we are trying to help the Kurds, Iraqis and Yazidis fight back so they can at least have a say in how they start their new ones. If we do nothing, then they will all be massacred, Iran will likely invade Iraq to help its allies, and you will have a colossal number of mostly innocent people dead or wishing they were.

There are free hoops for ball and he could get together some friends to play a game.There are also rec clubs for other sports that are free,  Then he blamed everyone for everything that was wrong in his life! So did his parents! Just blame everybody for what was their responsibility to teach their son something constructive. If he did't want college go to a Technical High School and learn a trade! Wtf! The cop was wrong, he was scared, none of it would have happened if he had parents who made sure he did something constructive and if he wouldn't cooperate then it was on him. This is not all the cops fault. As for the body cams they should be mandatory and so should dash cams. I am just trying to figure out how kids period have become so fucking violent and disrespectful. It is not the way it used to be. That's why I bought up rap. I truly want to understand the amount of violence and why its happening! I think its a combination of just shit coming at everybody now. Parents who use drugs, absentee parents, schools that don't care, then the parents expect cops to parent. Its happening way too much. I don't think cameras are going to answer the problem but they sure can make someone think twice as far as cops are concerned. People are being thugs in these cases. President Obama agrees with the body cams. Its about time he did something. It just keeps happening! No drones, police should be wearing body cams in every country. Why did it get so out of control though that this is what's needed?  Something is convincing young people crime is acceptable and it isn't. Their hero's suck, they are violent! The majority of rap is violent. Nothing but violence everywhere. Its effecting everybody! I am so sick of it! I have this violence fatigue! Geezus, every day its just violent stuff everywhere! Why van't young people turn it around! Create a movement against violence! I know I sound old and stupid to you but I care about the next generation. I don't see expression through art I see violent crap everywhere. Stop buying it and demand better for yourselves! Sometimes you just van't follow the crowd and what you do today does have a profound effect on tomorrow because it sets in motion certain types of patterns. Positive counteracts violence.

In the next year I'll be moving out of home and start paying rent/bills, but my regular income will cover that no problems. I'm going to be looking into the very early stages of mortgages, to see how much I would need to do a BTL, but that could just turn out to be I need a lot more than I have. I'd think it'd be good to do it as a repayment mortgage so that I would eventually own the property, or could at least sell it when I want to buy my own home. If this option were taken surplus funds would be used to pay off the mortgage faster.

I'm at the very start of my career so buying a house isn't a viable option if in the next year or two I find a new job the other side of the country.

The goal is really just to gain as much as I can from my money. Timeframe is minimum 2 years, but at the end of the 2 years, it's not like I will need to raid all of my savings, that's just when my grad scheme will finish and I'll be looking to either stay on at the company or other jobs. But still would be renting rather than buying out right.

For these next two years I could probably put in about £500 a month. I'm not wanting to go for huge gains (and therefore high risks) so something that just tracks the FTSE would be enough for me that balances all the risks.

Fiscally, UKIP may well sit to the left of the Tories. On an Authoritarian scale (immigration aside), Farrage seems much more of a relaxed chap than Cameron.

At least in how he *presents* official policy (we are talking about perceptions here). As we have seen, the supporters on the ground seem to be the Tory right and those to their right, along with a few people who don't understand immigration and who access scaremongering tabloid journalism.

I found the poll a surprise, but not for long. From many perspectives, UKIP *can* be seen as to the left of the Tories - especially since the Tories ran to the right after getting scared by UKIP, who really *could* damage them at the next election. UKIP are now unarguably a real political force, albeit a minority one whose appeal may shatter at any moment.

But in general, it is well known that breastfed babies spit up less. When you bottle feed, you're more likely to overfeed because the baby cannot regulate how much it is getting. Breastfeeding is very different in this regard, in that baby can regulate how much they take in and are therefore less likely to overeat and then spit up. 

You can google this on your own or ask an LC or pediatrician. 

But I'm not really sure what your point is in general. Yes, some babies spit up. Does that mean they should be banned from public places? Seeing how you've raised two kids, you know that when babies need to eat, they need to eat. Should parents (mothers in particular) be forced to stay out of public when babies are small?

Even though those recipients may need it. A cut to £9bn would be a cut of around £2.5bn.

Even if their job may not require English. 

&gt;UKIP will not offer an amnesty for illegal immigrants or those gaining British passports through fraud.

When there are people who have to use fraud to escape the place they are seeking asylum from.

There are some other things that don't directly appear to be an issue but *could* be, for example:

* They also use a lot of nebulous terms like ""British values"" or ""British culture"" without really explaining them. Those kinds of phrases *could* be used for racist means.
* ""UKIP will withdraw from the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights"" when ECHR protects people against discrimination. Yes, they are pre-existing UK laws that overlap with the ECHR to an extent which I Would assume would carry on, but it does raise concern.

Almost none of these 'characteristics' define Fascism or are in any way related to it. In fact most of them just describe basic human compulsions or behaviors.

&gt; Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause 

Everyone's done this throughout history, this is not remotely unique to Fascism.

&gt; Rampant Sexism
 
Again, common throughout history, not unique to Fascism (though no less repugnant)

&gt; Supremacy of the Military
 
Anyone with even basic knowledge of Mussolini's Italy and the Italian record of WWII could tell you that this is not a core aspect to the ideology. Militarism is though, but is different from this.

&gt; Religion and Government are Intertwined
 
Again, not an aspect of Fascism. The Nazis were extremely ambivalent on the status of religion as was Mussolini.

&gt; Obsession with Crime and Punishment
 
Not unique to Fascism. It is possible for democratic movements to campaign on a 'Law and Order' platform.

&gt; Rampant Cronyism and Corruption
 
Not unique to Fascism. In fact, Fascist governments are frequently riven by factionalism.

&gt; Fraudulent Elections

 Not unique to Fascism but pops up in every dictatorial government.

And so on. This is not even considering that ""Dr"" Lawrence (or Laurence) Britt is not a doctor or has any kind of training in politics or history, but is an ex-businessman who wrote this article to promote an anti-bush novel he wrote in 2004.

So really what we're saying is that UKIP is *slightly* less right wing than the Tories. They're still further right than the average voter, they're closer to the Tories than anything else, and they're further right from the average voter than labour is to the left. 


To be honest, describing UKIP as

Solid backup strikers, fantastic second keeper and in Luis someone who can challenge Dave. Schurrle is a good player, Mikel and Ramires can do a job but you wouldn't want them as regular starters.

That directly relates to this incident and the facts of this case, I explained that it wasn't just the fact that he had the gun that the jury found justified the shooting. You then respond by talking about a load of different cases.

The story changed because funnily enough when people are waving guns around everyone is quite stressed and might not have perfect 20/20 recollection. 

Clearly mistakes were made and the press should never been told details until they were sure, the police have owned up to that. Clearly the officer who fired did think he had a gun, otherwise he wouldn't have fired, so that that was the initial story is hardly surprising. This was then subsequently proved to be wrong, the story had to change in light of the new evidence.

There is a difference between a few press releases put out immediately after an incident and the findings of a court of law. It sounds like you still don't believe the court.

You say there is an accountability issue but clearly this incident sparked a massive investigation and was closely scrutinised, sounds pretty accountable to me. People just refuse to accept the outcome of due process because it doesn't fit with the narrative they have created in the meantime. 

The UK police have shot 12 people since 2000, less than 1 a year, and  everyone has sparked close media scrutiny and a large investigation. That doesn't sound unaccountable to me.

Bullshit. I agree that consistency of managers is great for players sometimes, but not in the case of Torres. He had two seasons with Ancelotti, and couldn't prove his worth, and had one with Robbie and Jose. We even changed the formation to be more suited to his needs.

All it proved is that, no matter the style of play, he lost his spark. Not because of him, not because of the managers, but because of injuries he suffered whilst at Liverpool.

It would depend on why you supported the BNP. If you supported them for reasons motivated by racism, sure, if not, they you might not be.

It would depend on the proportions of differing races in that area, as with before, if the population of the area were 80% Arabic and 20% non-Arabic, but of those affected by the war, 50% were non-Arabic, then it may be based on race and possibly racist.

Part of the problem is that General Elections only happen every 4/5 years.

Yet if you were born in 1993, you'll turn 18 in 2011, and 2015 is *four years* away! By lowering the age to 16, that means people are more likely to get the chance to vote before they turn 20. So if you were born in 1993, you'd turn 16 in 2009 and would've been able to vote in the 2010 election.

Yes, of course, I just specified Eastern Europeans because the person I replied to mentioned that area. Having previously been under Soviet rule, these countries are actually a lot less developed and have poorer economies, but that doesn't really matter.

&gt;There is no chance in hell that the UK would ever have such a system. Americans would have a far easier time getting in than, say, Malaysians, and not just because of income or skills.

An integrated society, built upon the common use of a particular language, is the foundation stone of any civilization. The Tower of Babel might just be a religious allegory, but its message is pretty spot on.

Refusing to at least learn the local language has negative externalities on the society that is currently supporting you. It creates a microcosm of inward looking members that can only 'communicate' in the loosest sense of the work through intermediaries. Your employment prospects are microscopic. Your use to the larger society-as-a-whole is considerably reduced. You suck all the good the larger group offers, but provide little in return. No man is an island, and nor is an isolate group of foreign monoglots.

There's nothing wrong with Little Chinas, and Little Indias - they thrive because they are able to generate commerce with the local community. Creating what are effectively foreign enclaves in an asylum-providing country is backwards.

It has been catalysed by the media that the root of the problem is immigration. This, of course, can not be further from the truth. The media shows us what we want to see. If you read only the Daily Mail, you'll be convinced that hordes of Islamic militants are stampeding around every town and city in the country, taking all our jobs. Media warps the truth way out of proportion.

The truth is, immigration both saves this country and is not actually a problem at all. The problem is us. The UK has become intolerant of immigrants because of the government. When there is a poor economy, a shortage of housing and the big rich boys from the big city don't pay their billions in taxes, it trickles down to the media. Media which is run by the very politicians and bankers that have exploited us.

To shift blame, it's easy. Turn everyone in on themselves, it's the most classic of diversionary tactics. So simple it's almost insulting to the public to be quite frank, resulting in false stories about what has caused these issues. The fact is, if there were more jobs, better wages being paid, better public service facilities and more houses built, there would be much less blame on immigrants.

The government and the bankers have made a right fucking mess and failed the British people and the best way to stop them pointing the finger at parliament, is to have the media blame it on the immigrants. It's so easy and everyone has taken the bait.

That is why UKIP voting is knee jerk and done so without any research. But a rise in UKIP votes is an indication not of the problems with immigration and a problem with politics (though the latter is most certainly true), but it shows how easily manipulated the public are.

He later got into black pride and ""Am I Black Enough For Ya"" is possibly one of my favourite tracks of all time. Debate remains on how genuine he was as a gangsta and how much was hype. Some people from Philly claimed he wasn't down with the gangs and that they were kind of pissed at him for taking their name in vain.

Ice-T copied Schoolly's style, made it a bit more West Coast,  and really formed what we now call ""Gangsta""; his first four albums are amazing, and chart the musical changes on the scene really well IMO. He was a gang member for certain, but how involved he was is not quite clear. He always claimed he kept quiet so as to not incriminate himself; his critics claim he only ever stole a couple of cars (what he got caught for IIRC).

After NWA hit, the whole hip hop scene swung towards Gangsta and that's when I stopped listening to it. It was all guns, bitches and blunts. The variety died.

If you haven't seen it, watch the early Chris Rock movie ""CB4"". It's a hilarious parody of early gangsta studio rappers, with side-jokes about Professor Griff and the ""Black Power"" genre; and it has cameos from Ice T and Eazy E.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, I will prove to you, because you are unable to read and do basic math and research, that the EU report referenced in my original post and included below for convenience, is correct and is indeed referring to general practitioners/Primary care physicians/Doctors, all the same thing.

The Eu report says that the UK has 2.8 doctors per 1000 population.

In this report:  http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/data-and-charts/gp-numbers-relative-uk-populations they report the number of general practitioners per 10,000 in all the countries inside the UK from in 2004 - 2011

I take the results form 2011:

England 6.8
Wales 6.7
Scotland 8.2
Northern Ireland 6.1

For a total of 2.71 per 1,000 in 2011
The Eu report says that we have 2.8 per 1,000 in 2014

We can clearly see that the EU report is using only general practitioners as their figures and that in fact the number of GP's per head has increased 2011- 2014.

&amp;nbsp;

Now please tell me again how I am bending the truth?

would be racist. But if were to state,

*""There are too many people from India coming to the UK and using our benefits""*

It takes on the subtlety of an immigration debate. I might even hope that denying 'Indian country' people access to the UK that the problem of too many 'Indian people' in my country would die out in a few generations.

If women actually want to leave the house, they will need to be able to feed their baby. If they breastfeed, that means they will need to use their boobs. It's actually quite simple. 

The problem (and maybe all the men commenting here can try to take a minute to understand this from someone who has actually breastfed a baby) is that breastfeeding is hard and complicated and can be quite stressful in the beginning. For it to be successful, you need to be able to breastfeed anywhere and everywhere you go with baby. This is why laws have been created (in the US at least) to make it so that women can breastfeed anywhere they are. When you start having people trying to stop women from breastfeeding in public, it creates a barrier and makes some women uncomfortable. This decreases breastfeeding success. And breastfeeding is really what is best for baby and mom. 

Mothers get frustrated at discussions like the very one taking place in this thread because it does come off at anti-breastfeeding. The best way to be supportive is to just say ""Yes, I support breastfeeding. If you don't want to see a boob, look away. Very simple."" But when you start having these discussions about being ""considerate of others"" (people who are apparently frightened and disgusted by breastfeeding) or implying that a woman should ""cover up,"" or ""be discrete,"" it sends the message that breastfeeding is something that women should be ashamed of or hide, that a woman should put the feelings of adults ahead of the need to sustain the life of her baby. Or that they should just stay shut in their homes. You may think it's benign, but as someone who has actually breastfed, I can tell you that it feels horrible to hear and see these discussions. It leaves you feeling like you have to fight for the ability to just feed your child in public. 

And the spit up argument is just absurd and grasping.

The point being that these players were with us arguably in their prime. Bale was not, despite how good he was. Is Suarez a Liverpool legend? Nope.

* ""Thrupenny bit"" (3d) was and still is Cockeny rhyming slang for ""tit"", thus you might hear someone say ""it gets right on my thrupennies"" meaning ""it annoys me.""
* The Penny Farthing bicycle is obviously named for it's large and small wheels, a penny (coin) being physically larger than a farthing.
* The correct pronunciation for a half-penny or ha'penny is HAY-pnee
* Shillings used to be made of pure sterling silver, and weighed approximately 1/20th of a pound, hence ""pounds sterling."" (Actually, it's a lot more complicated than that, and varied throughout the history of the currency.)
* You might read characters in old books asking for a ""penn'orth"" of something, especially sweets (candy). It's a portmanteau of penny-worth. Similarly, where an American might offer ""my two cents"" (their opinion) a Brit might say ""my two penn'orth"" or ""my tuppence worth.""
* Farthing was sometimes used to mean other things than pennies divided into four; it's just an archaic word for quarter.
* The [King's shilling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_shilling) was a shilling given to recruits into the British Army or Navy - once you'd accepted the shilling, you were committed to being a soldier/sailor (although you could actually still return it before being sworn in, so long as you hadn't spent it.)",0,1418569188,null,0,false,0,cmujgby,t3_2p8ym9,t1_cmujgby,t3_2p8ym9,null,1425440133,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7

I think its hard for a democratic state to be totalitarian because democracy implies alternatives to the current government. In a totalitarian state, you can't really have an effective opposition while simultaneously maintaining the total control of the state over all affairs. 

A dictatorship isn't necessarily totalitarian because an autocratic dictator wields power mostly within the political realm. A totalitarian dictator, or party, will seek to infuse everything, from arts to science to education, with their an ideology.

&gt; [Prioritise social housing for people whose parents and grandparents were born locally.](http://www.ukip.org/issues)

This is simply straight up racist. It's a policy that is prejudiced against British citizens on the basis that their parents were foreigners.

In addition, if we look at the [UKIP Manifesto](http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/themes/5308a93901925b5b09000002/attachments/original/1398869254/EuroManifestoLaunch.pdf?1398869254) on the assumption that blaming a problem on immigrants when it's not caused by them is racist (because it sort of is):

&gt; Our green spaces are threatened
by over-development largely brought
about by the population pressure
caused by mass immigration


This part is a blatant lie that blames immigrants for a problem that is caused by reduced local council funding. 

&gt; Mass immigration has coincided with
soaring youth unemployment and stagnant
wages that have not kept pace
with the cost of living

This part blames a problem caused by a global recession on immigrants.



Aside from that, parts of their manifesto I don't like the tone of and , given how vague they are being, will allow myself to read into:

&gt; In the meantime, your UKIP MEPs will continue to go to
Brussels and Strasbourg with a mission unlike that of any
other party.
We don’t go there to make the EU better, more powerful, and
help it pass more laws.
We go there to find out what it’s up to, and let you know. 

That part's kind of ridiculous and has some heavy overtones of don't trust Johnny Foreigner to it.

&gt; A National, Not International,
Health Service

&gt;It is important that everyone in the
UK has access to free medical care.
Visitors and migrants to the UK must
show proof of health insurance as a
condition of entry to the UK

I think this implies that we might deny healthcare to visitors who aren't insured and I think healthcare is a universal right.

&gt; On 1st January the UK threw open
its borders to unlimited numbers of
Bulgarian and Romanian citizens. The
Government admits it cannot control
the numbers of migrants from other
EU countries.

This isn't a policy but I think it's designed to make people scared of the bad immigrants form Eastern Europe, especially seeing as it ignores facts like the number of workers from those countries actually falling since the restriction was lifted.

false,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"&gt;Does anyone really know how UKIP feel about issues other than EU membership?

Politics student here. 

With UKIP it is very difficult to actually pin point what their beliefs are (other than leaving the EU) because they change it so frequently, and so dramatically. I have UKIP's 2010 manifesto in front of me, but Nigel Farage consistently claims he has no idea what's in the manifesto, despite campaigning on it in 2010. 

Additionally, they tend to be extremely lacking in any sort of (coherent) ideology. I mean, it's obvious that a lot of the core Kippers are former members of the Conservative party who subscribed to ""Nationalist-Authoritarian Conservatism"" (Enoch Powell is the defining member of this branch of Conservatism). The thing is, the ""nationalist-Authoritarian"" is a sub section of the ""Conservatism"" bit and the core belief of Conservatism is that you should be in power and be pragmatic (The Conservatives themselves were in power for about 60 of the last 100 years). So Ideologically the Kippers are totally fine being complete populists. 

That said, there are a few areas of their ideology which do remain. For instance, the Conservative reluctance to change. The Conservative party don't like any sort of radical reform, unless it is seen as absolutely necessary for them to support it in order to get power. They did not like House of Lords reform, the Euro, or the devolved assemblies (in Edinburgh and Cardiff). Even the most famous Conservative prime minister (Winston Churchill) campaigned *against* the creation of the welfare state and the NHS during the 1945 election. UKIP are the same. They just go *a lot* further and thing that we should go back about 30 years, before any of the non-free market dimensions of the EU came into effect. The Authoritarianism is visible through their previous manifesto commitments to building more aircraft carriers (even though we don't have enough aircraft to fill the ones we're already building). The Nationalism is also visible through their commitment to see Britain as an independent nation, rather than as an island filled with humans. The Conservatism and the nationalism combine to a lust for protection of ""British values"" and ""British traditions"" like working for excessively long amounts of time, the local pub, stiff upper lip and any policies they can support to endorse those sorts of old fashioned behaviours.

The king might be a great man but can you be sure every person down the line is?.

The way a democracy is supposed to work is that people who rule (lead, rule is a dicey word) are held to account for malfeasance (if you'd just be so kind as to step away from the Bankers, the Paedophile Coverup, the vested interests, the expenses scandal I can say this without breaking into laughter).

Of course what we have now is barely a democracy anymore (and arguably hasn't been for a long time), those in power are not held to account and the media shouts and thunders about inconsequential bullshit while large corporations leg it out the back door with the countries silverware.

I'm really not sure what the solution is anymore, hoping for a corrupt system to internally regulate itself back to not been *so* corrupt is a pipe-dream, I'm starting to think the only way this mess will ever be resolved is externally and I can't see how that is going to happen either.

In the mean time lets turn everyone against everyone fighting over the scraps while those at the head of the table laugh it up.

One of the very few players in the team that are willing to take responsibility and try to make something happen (Not everything he did came off but the intent was positive).

Meanwhile, Coutinho, who is the biggest culprit in the team for hesitating and hesitating right in front of the opponents' back four, starts and performs sloppily despite showing some neat little tricks in areas where it doesn't really matter. Coutinho on current form has a poor final ball, attack-wasting hesitancy at the critical moment and overall is just an ineffective player right now.

false,34Mbit,eng-Bristol,Bristol,"&gt; What kind of negative externalities are being had on Germany, for example?

I can't say. I know Germany has a sizeable Turkish immigrant population, but I understand they generally learn German to an acceptable standard quickly.

&gt;As far as I can see, they benefit more from having second and third languages - they have the edge in certain circumstances.

Germans don't learn the language of their economic migrant visitors, or asylum seekers. They've learned English (56%) and French (14%) mostly.

&gt;In general, I think it's the height of arrogance to demand that people who visit or reside in the UK all speak English

With tourists excluded, how can I be expected to communicate with the thousands of languages foreigners might speak? A migrant or asylum seeker has to learn one language; English. I on the other hand must have to learn 

Romanian, Tagalog/Filipino, Persian/Farsi, German, Lithuanian, Somali, Italian, Turkish, Tamil, Spanish, Portuguese, French, Arabic, Gujarati, Bengali, Urdu, Punjabi, and Polish.

That's just the next eighteen languages after English spoken in the UK (not including Welsh). That's probably a few decades of solid work to learn all those languages, when only 3-4% of the population speaks any of them. Or, that 3-4% could be expected to learn just *one* language. Hmm, choices.

&gt;It only speaks of their intelligence and hospitality as oppose to our ignorance and intolerance.

If you discount those in Germany who speak the international second language of English, then only 14% of the country speaks another foreign language - similar to the 19% in the UK. What European language can English speakers learn that has as big a bang-per-buck as foreigners learning English? Is it French (only about 20% of the EU speaks French, versus 55% English).

&gt;Perhaps that's why the British Empire conquered half the world - through taking advantage of hospitable people, on that basis - you might be right.

Obviously it's all nice and dandy to keep saying that, but I've come to terms with the fact that we will likely finish 4th at the very best. It's more likely that we will finish outside of the top 4 however.

Given that, I just want to see the team improve in the way we're playing. Let's not forget the earlier games this season where we were passing the ball around in the back for the entire game. We probably had the most opportunities of the season thus far today. Unfortunately, Sterling has lost his finishing touch, Balotelli hasn't recovered his and De Gea was fantastic. Under different circumstances, we may be singing a totally different tune.

Granted, the team did make some glaring mistakes. The first goal is a great example of this. Moreover, Lovren's clearance was a disaster, especially considering the time and space he could have had. That being said, I think our defending has somewhat improved over the past weeks. It's not ideal but it's getting better.

Rodgers is losing it. Everything that made the side last year has gone. The pace, the youth, the pressing. It's gone. Instead, there is defensive solidarity percieved in choosing the older players. Like Johnson. Like Skrtel.

Before the game, on Twitter, with all those team sheets flying out, I was just shaking my head all that time. The time to drop Mignolet was not today. Today doesn't prove anything apart from he's finished at this club at the end of the season. Jones was abysmal, diving multiple times the wrong way. (See the first goal).

A back 3 of Johnson, Skrtel and Lovren is a disaster. Not only have we not practiced that before, none of them are ball playing CB's. We had 2 last year in Agger and Sakho. They can feed into the midfield. We don't have a CB who can do that. It's literally asking to be pressed and caught out.

Henderson and Allen are limited in their play. I said this last year, although I wasn't on Reddit last year. If we have Henderson in our team, he has to be, to put it eloquently, a shitehouse. He needs to wind people up. To be aggressive. To put his mark on other players. He hid during the Basel game and he hid today. Allen, I have no idea what he's supposed to do. Infact, from the start to Man Utd's first goal, I counted what he was doing and he made 6/11 passes, 0 interceptions and 0 tackles. Allen's a passenger. We don't have time for him. 

Gerrard's time is up. We know it. He knows it. Have a look at his man marking for Rooney's goal. Lucas would've stuck to Rooney and stopped him getting the shot away. Gerrard was literally walking at the edge of the box.

I can't argue about the front 3. I've been long thinking about converting Sterling into a Suarez. I still think it can work. What he makes up for in mental toughness he compensates with Speed and agility. Sterling's the real deal.

For me, even though we played better than we did before in this match, I was hit the most. We spent over 100 M, and we had no recognized striker in our team. We had to drop our keeper. Our 18M signing can't get on the bench, even when our defense is as bad as it is. Can doesn't play. Markovic doesn't either.

It's really a mixture of the two and depends highly on the specific circumstances. Historically, revolutions and outside influences are the most frequent producers of totalitarian regimes, but totalitarian regimes have sprouted from democracies, and democracies from totalitarian regimes. 

Just, for some examples. Nazi Germany was born from the democratic Weimar republic. The electorate felt disillusioned with the liberal capitalist model and voted for extreme parties who seemed to offer credible solutions. The Nazis never did quite get a majority in the Bundestag (Parliament), but Hitler had been made the leader of Germany because he was the leader of the larger party in a coalition government (keep in mind the all Germany governments during this period, and most governments in Europe today are coalitions) and as such was the Chancellor of Germany (equivalent to our prime minister). When the Reichstag was set on fire, a majority of the elected representatives, including all but a handful of Communists, voted to make the Bundestag void, and allow Hitler personally to pass the legislation, without needing the Bundestag's consent. 

Revolution is more common, though. Just think of the French and Russian Revolutions. The only difference is, these revolutions led to totalitarianism, and ended with it too. Mussolini and the Brown Shirts are a different example. They had a revolution (kind of) in a democracy which led to totalitarianism. 

Outside influences have a lot of examples. Thing of all of Eastern Europe after the defeat of the Nazis. The Soviet Union used its huge influence in those areas to set up puppet regimes. Often this involved having sham elections which they either won by manipulating the opposition (many leaders of opposition parties got arrested by the state police) or even using the Red Army to appoint a preferred candidate (as happened in Romania). Thing also, of many of the African regimes which got set up after the British and the French pulled out. I mean, the British and the French themselves did act in a non-democratic manner often in Africa, but they seldom demanded complete (""total"") control/obedience over public and private life in the same way other regimes did. 

The only other set of examples worth considering has now largely died out and won't be returned. It's the monarchies which had been there since 'time in perpetum'. Like England in the year 1000, and most of the rest of Europe. Someone held absolute and total power just because they always had done. That's just how society had developed.

2. Lovren &amp; Skrtel positioning and teamwork (between eachother) was horrific

3. Jones wasn't all that bad when you consider the defense in front of him.  Would Migs have been better? Surely but nonetheless I still think we would have lost

4. Gerrard was completely absent in this game. I know his experience in this derby was important, but still. Would have loved to have seen Lucas playing instead.

5. Allen was essentially absent from the game

6. Henderson made a bit of impact, but seems to be doing what Gerrard did last year. Making up for everyone else deficiencies. You can not be everywhere at once

7. Coutinho has been a shadow of himself last year. Seems to have lost all passing ability, ball handling skills, confidence, and especially work ethic

8. Lallana looked okay in the first half. Was willing to take people on, made decent runs and passes.

9. Markovic made a few good runs in his limited time.

10. Sterling was good but definitely needs finishing practice.  Was by far our best player.  If we aren't careful with him we WILL lose him this summer to City, Barca, Real, PSG, Monaco, or Bayern.  He needs either a break for a game or this January we better sign someone to help complement him like Suarez and Sturridge did.

11. I though Balotelli was pretty excellent today and put himself into great positions and had a real go at goal.  If De Gea wasn't so Godly today he could've had himself a near hattrick.

12. I would have loved to have seen Can on instead of Allen, Lucas instead of Gerrard (then Gerrard brought on as super-sub if needed); and seriously why was Borini not starting? I like Rodgers and hope we stick with him till at least till Jan transfer window of next season, but he needs to grow the fuck up and give up on his little fits about players.  We needed a striker today. Borini is fit fucking play him.

-I honestly thought this was an Awful time to try Brad Jones in goal. Waited the entire season and then puts brad Jones in probably the biggest/most high pressure League game of the year. And he was clearly nervous and out of his league (hence the jumping and guessing)

-Joe Allen should not still be starting for us. He's really just a mediocre player, anyone outside of a liverpool fan can see this as clear as day. We and BR all like him and we keep thinking he's something he's not. 

-Sterling is definitely having some major confidence issues. He's in his own head. 

-Lovren, fuck man

-Unlucky all around but in particular with Balotelli. I thought he looked very positive and it would have been nice to see him in the entire game and have given Lallana some rest. And I swear now that Balos healthy if I see Ricki Lambert starting in front of him 1 more time I'm going to lose my mind. 

-To me this was probably the most painful game of the season. Really fucking devastating particularly because we had so many chances and didn't convert, and we handed them all of their chances. Never seen a game 3-0 that literally could have been 0-3 (maybe 1-3 hah) if we handled those key moments properly (i.e the lovren mucked clearance, the offsides goal not being called offside, Sterling not finishing those chances, Balotelli getting a great shot blocked somehow)

They scored two goals that both hit pretty central in the net. Rooney's was definitely savable in that position from that range. RvP received an obvious pass and had a giant gaping goal to roll it into. The middle goal was obviously offsides and not his fault. The other goals were far from all his fault, but he did nothing to help the team.

false,dubloweye,lfc12,,"So many things about that performance need to be addressed.

Rodgers:
Starting Johnson instead of Toure. These sorts of decisions mean that when you fix the initial fuck up (ala Enrique starting vs Basel) you lose an option to change the game later on.
Starting Joe Allen instead of Lucas. Yes Joe Allen works hard, but hard work on its own when the player isn't very good doesn't win you games. Lucas doesn't run around like a headless chicken, he runs with a purpose and gets his job done efficiently.

Jones:
I'm far from Joe Allen's biggest fan (more on this later), but entirely blaming him for an undeflected shot from outside the area in which the keeper dives the wrong way isn't particularly fair. Played much better than Migs after that though. The fact that he played looks like we are looking for a keeper in January.

Joe Allen:
Got horrendously violated for the first goal. Ran around a lot. Shouldn't be playing ahead of Lucas. The argument that he keeps possession is bollocks, yes his passes find their man, but the man he chooses to pass to is usually in a crap position/is the keeper/is a centre back/has their marker up his arse. His range of passing is fairly limited too. Should be playing backup to Lucas at best.

Hendo:
Needs a rest. Difference between him and Allen is that he's not making bad decisions, his passes are just not coming off, a break could rejuvenate him. If Johnson hadn't come off I would have liked to have seen Emre come on for him.

Coutinho:
See Henderson but replace needing a rest with needing a decent run in the side and not 20 minutes here and there against Basel.

Sterling:
Sturridge aside nobody else in the side gets remotely close to being in the position to miss those chances in the first place. Another player that needs a rest. Should be a more realistic prospect now that Lazar has been looking good and can cover for him.

Balotelli:
Looked good. Hopefully gets some time in midweek maybe get a goal to get his confidence up.

Without Spotify I'd listen to far less music than I do now, and far less socially. The ability to create playlists, share at house parties, play on TVs, phones etc has made music far more accessible than me wandering into a record shop would do.

Impersonal? Perhaps, but that doesn't mean I'd be getting together with friends to go to the shops to buy music if I didn't have Spotify.

It's all just throwing shit at the wall and hoping it sticks. He has no real goal but a bunch of loose ends and none of those can bail him out when the plan starts to go down the drain.

false,multijoy,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;Preemptive attacks require strong justification - they're armed, multiple attackers, they're visibly high, you just witnessed them shove someone into the road ... etc.

Less justification than you think. All you require is an honest held belief that you're about to get a shoeing, then you're pretty much golden. Once you start pursuing after the threat has reasonably passed (the householder who goes after a burglar and inflicts GBH level injuries), then you're in a whole different ball game.

&gt;Who said anything about backing down? Niceities of the law?! OK - the police aren't going to spend that much time on a bit a barney ... but anything approaching ABH / battery?

You're demonstrating a lack of knowledge now. Battery is the alternative charge for common assault where contact is made - they're mostly interchangeable but, strictly speaking 'battery' involves contact and assault simply requires that an apprehension of unlawful violence is imminent. ABH is any assault where the injury is more than simply transient - a slap that leaves visible reddening, for example. In all cases of assault, self defence is a perfectly viable defence to the charge. The more serious the assault, the more justification you'd have to provide and the more likely it would be for a court to decide, but nevertheless.

&gt;Your comment would suggest a person might use lethal force and be protected by the law

They would be. If a householder kills a burglar (say) by hitting him a couple of times with a golf club, or they stab them with a knife they've just picked up off the table, there's a very real chance that the CPS would not charge. They're going to be nicked, because that needs to be investigated, but the right to defend oneself is enshrined in the common law.

I would also refer you to the recent changes to PACE Code G which the government inserted to highlight that a householder shouldn't be nicked unless really necessary (for example) if they've been defending themselves.

&gt;but it revolves around 'escape', not pride

I said nothing about pride, and the law says nothing about escape. I note your counter-edit regarding a bloke in a wheelchair, but you know and I know that that is a specious argument. That said, some years ago there was a serial necklace snatcher in Islington who had no legs, and was solid muscle from the waist up. So it is entirely possible to construct a scenario where you could need to use a pre-emptive strike on a wheelchair user!

It starts with a party that offers almost no concrete policies other than to 'sort out' those external forces, be they Europe, Jews, Muslims, or whatever.

I've tried to hold my tongue with the BR stuff so far but at this point I really do think he's fucking up.

&gt;CJ340 Wholly unacceptable levels of men, women and children are currently imprisoned at great cost to their future rehabilitation, as well as to their families, the taxpayer and society in general. The Green Party is therefore committed to significantly reducing the prison population. To that end, a range of measures will be used, including changes to sentencing policy and practice. Courts will have a duty to reduce use of custodial sentencing in favour of community sentencing.
Immediate prison reforms

&gt;CJ380 The physical and social standards of prisoners will be improved so that as far as possible the only limitation on the dignity of their lives will be the denial of freedom of movement outside the prison. Prisoners would normally have their own room. They would enjoy extended facilities for communication and association with family and friends including unsupervised visits. Prisoners would as far as possible be detained near their family and home community.

&gt;CJ381 Recognising the nature of the female prison population, with high levels of mental illness, experience of being a victim of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence, and caring responsibilities for children, the only women who should be in custody are those very few that commit serious and violent crimes and who present a threat to the public.

&gt;CJ382 For the vast majority of women in the criminal justice system, solutions in the community are more appropriate. Community sentences must be designed to take account of women’s particular vulnerabilities and domestic and childcare commitments. The restrictions placed on sentencers around breaches of community orders must be made more flexible.

&gt;CJ383 Existing women’s prisons should be replaced with suitable geographically dispersed, small, multi-functional custodial centres. More supported accommodation should be provided for women on release to break the cycle of repeat offending and custody.

&gt;CJ384 Pregnant women in prison are particularly vulnerable and the scheme provided by the charity Birth Companions, which visits pregnant prisoners once a week, stays with them through birth and gives them support afterwards, should be extended to all women who wish to use it, with government funding.

&gt;CJ385 Prisoners should have improved access to meaningful activities, particularly real work and education and artistic and creative facilities. Particular efforts should be focused on ensuring all prisoners attain levels of literacy sufficient to allow them to function effectively in modern society.

&gt;CJ386 Prisoners will be offered counselling and appropriate assistance to overcome the root cause of their offences and reduce the likelihood of re-offending.

&gt;CJ387 Homelessness after release is a significant factor in reoffending. We will seek innovative schemes - such as offering training in construction skills that prisoners can use to restore dilapidated housing that they can then inhabit - to help deal with the problem.

&gt;CJ388 Prisoners rights will be legally enforceable and will be supplemented by grievance procedures and a prisoners' complaints commission, headed by a prison ombudsperson to whom appeal can be made if a grievance cannot be resolved within a particular institution. Regular spot inspections by lay visitors and Department of Justice inspectors will further contribute to ensure standards are maintained and human rights safeguarded. Suicide and self-harm are a huge problem within our prisons and we will ensure prevention efforts are stepped up. ‘Buddy schemes’, where prisoners help each other, guided by organisations such as The Samaritans, will be strongly encouraged.

&gt;CJ389 The Prison Medical Service will be incorporated into the improved National Health Service (see Health Policy). Its responsibilities will cover access to complementary health care, health education and the provision of counselling as well as the direct medication care of prisoners.

&gt;CJ390 The Health and Safety Acts and Factories Acts, the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Unfitness provisions of the Housing Act 1985 will also be applied to prisons, and Crown Immunity will be abolished in relation to prisons.

&gt;CJ391 Young People under the age of 18 would no longer be kept in custody. Social Services Departments will have the responsibility to establish and run a range of small secure residential homes to cater for the needs of particular types of young people with special needs. Safeguards similar to those set out in CJ383 will be built in to the system.

&gt;CJ392 There will be adequate facilities and a suitable environment to allow a young child to stay or live with their parent or guardian in custody when this is considered to be in the best interests of the child.

&gt;CJ393 We oppose privatisation, use of PFI and any creeping or part privatisation of our prisons and the prison service.

Now why did you have to go to lengths provide decent informed answers and then end with that slight.

I don't have a chip on the shoulder at all - I'm not setting up for an argument and daring you to take a shot.

But when I observe the English abroad (and I try not to, I try to avoid other English people) I often observe a lack of humility that should come with the privilege of being accidental masters of the international business language.

I'm not saying all Brits need to learn half a dozen languages in order to demonstrate intelligence and hospitality, I'm saying that all Brits should be mindful that they place expectations on other races/countryfolk that they would reject for themselves.

From my observations and the media rhetoric in the UK at current, they seem to take this for granted and behave in a rather inhospitable manner towards immigrants - I find it arrogant.

I don't agree British people should expect other races to learn English in order to come to the UK, just as I don't agree that British people should have to learn German to visit Germany, or Turkish to visit Turkey.

**To be clear** - I am not saying it is arrogant to not know another language, I'm saying it is arrogant to point at one person for not knowing your language, when you don't know theirs. Especially considering the fact that if you visit their country, you will probably find those willing to speak your language to you - rather than point and make accusations.",0,1418574308,null,0,false,0,cmul9vq,t3_2p921r,t1_cmul9vq,t1_cmujz9z,null,1425439228,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I didnt think Jones was abyssmal, I felt his view of the ball was blocked by skrtel in the first goal and he had to guess, cant remember any other examples of bad goalkeeping. He definitely didnt make any errors on the same level as Mignolet has been, also it was a game of massive pressure, its fair to cut him some slack, i think he deserves to at least start against Bournemouth and we can reassess the situtation before Arsenal. 

You are saying we lack youth? Moreno and Coutinho were the cause of the first goal not Jones or Gerrard. Our offensive players created more chances than we have in the last few games combined, if you said we lacked pace after the newcaslte game or something I would understand but we were a real threat going forward.

You have called out three defenders there mate, we only have so many. You expect him to play youth players? Other than playing toure (which he should have done) I dont see what else he could have done, sakho wasnt fit yet. 

Yeh Allen wasnt good enough again. Id rather have seen Can get another chance. Henderson has been below par no matter where he has played. I think no matter who we play in CM we will have an issue.

They're struggling to resolve the disconnect with what they believe about immigrants with what they experience.

This is one of the reasons why going after UKIP and BNP over racism is a dangerous play for the big parties: A lot of their voters won't see themselves as racist, and will be able to *genuinely* say that they have immigrant or black/asian friends that they treat well, and will feel insulted rather than ""see the light"".

*The team*: Great opening 12 minutes but a lower tempo since then has allowed Swansea to collect themselves a bit more. Equally, we pressed really high at the start and that was effective. Energy levels dropping have again allowed Swansea to collect themselves and break out of their own half. 

**Strengths**:    

*Lloris*: The man is a rock. Toe-poking, ball punching, beautiful french-men. 

*Kane*: Bringing the energy. Dropping deep to help with overloading the the midfield and create possession. The goal was nice to see. 

*Davies:* As I was saying earlier, he didn't seem to show up on the radar until his last-ditch tackle on Bony. Not noticing him is just as important as him always popping up into our attention. Seems to be positioning himself very well. 

*Lamela*: Is getting stuck in and tracking back. Decision making is still spotty but is promising. Lamela is obviously suffering from the physicality of the PL and needs to watch those elbows of his. 

**The bad**:

*Fazio and Vert*: I am going to speak of them together because they're collectively responsible for shutting down Bony. Fazio's lack of awareness and slow turning is allowing Bony time to slip in. If Vert is responsible for marking him then he has done nothing to show he can take on the job. They need to communicate better. Fazio looks complacent.

*Eriksen*: He doesn't look comfortable out on the left and isn't getting himself as involved as we're use to. 

*Soldado*: His energy levels are high, and you can see the desire but something just isn't clicking for a player of his type. We've beat this horse to death.

- Child care takes mothers out of the labor market, so when they return they have less work experience than similarly-aged males. 

- Men were almost twice as likely as women to work more than 40 hours a week

false,Karlsberg62,null,null,"Lallana was taken off because he had a fucking broken rib before supports blame Rodgers for that. 

Team looked good offensively today, so many chances that on any other day with any other keeper would've made the game a draw. The second goal was just a bad refereeing decision. Bad decision like that don't make you lose your two best goalscorers, nor patch a leaky defense however.

Personally, I want to blame management but they did invest heavily. Rodgers had the finally word on the signings. His signings haven't shown up. His tactics that won over so many pundits, fast attacking football is gone. His old tactics when he was first introduced are back which did us no favors and doesn't use our strengths. 

Sterling, Markovic, Can, Henderson, Borini, Moreno are all athletic and good runners, yet we play possession football and bought Balotelli? Balotelli works best when having a partner, yet we bought 3 attacking midfielders in the transfer window and a striker who does exactly the same job as Balotelli. 

Gerrard is past his best by far, just watch the replay for Rooney's goal today. He's meant to be marking him in the position he was playing. Personally Lucas should be on the pitch more than Gerrard at the moment to cover our awful defense. 

Allen was a passenger in midfield for the entire game, he's ok at passing the ball sideways, but other than that? Nothing. No product to his game other than being someone to pass to. 

Lovren and Skrtel's partnership is all over the place, doesn't look like they've played a single game together ever. £20M defender who can't pass the ball out of defense longer than 5 yards. Funny that I rate Toure higher than either of these two currently and he was entirely free!

Johnson is getting past it and puts a good shift in going forward, but rarely tracks back and Moreno does the same however his youth saves him a little as he can recover or trackback faster. 

Oh and a goalkeeper? Jones was alright today, not a lot he could've done. Just goes to show how a world class keeper grows into his role. Could Mignolet do that? Would love to see it happen, but in our situation at the moment the defense as a whole should be turning around and work together to improve instead of playing for themselves to help ease the increasing burden on our keeper. De Gea had a great defence in front of him, albeit it was aging, but still great. Liverpool don't have that and it shows. De Gea learned from the best in how to organize, communicate and become a leader to a class defence that in turn trusted him. Learn from the best to become to best. 

Our defence look like they don't trust themselves, let alone our goalkeeper and other defenders currently. Get them down to the training pitches, let them work it out instead of bickering about problem we know about already. They'll get there. It's just if that time is well spent in the clubs eyes or their is a quicker way around this by using Sahko or buying in January.

In other words, our system of play is in a standstill stuck between Rodgers beliefs and our players best way to play. Previously we had a compromise that took two seasons to build. Built around Suarez... 

I expect this season to be a stepping stone where we aim for Europa League and then push on with our current youthful players that I've previously mentioned and I pray that they learn what it feels like to be booted out the Champions league and the expectations of the club and fans. I hope they can patch together something that works with the current players and management as we're too predictable and frankly, we're boring to watch. 

TL;DR. Defense is shit, Midfield is hot and cold, Attack is lacking in playstyle. Rodgers signings and tactics need adapting quick. Today was an improvement however, as we made chances and the scoreline doesn't reflect the match. Taught a lesson in finishing and you might as well prepare for next season as this season is transition yet again. This is all personal opinion, don't get mad at opinions or you're gonna have a bad time.

EDIT: I recognized when looking over this that I missed a lot of timestamps.

I believe that BR's tactical decisions have been poor pre-United game. The United game wasn't his fault. The players just didn't show up at the back and the players that did show up just couldn't carry the team. I do believe however that Lucas over Allen would've been a better decision and I'm 50/50 with swapping Jones in, Mignolet needed to be dropped but this wasn't the game to do it in.

De Gea had that amazing defence when SAF signed him and you had the likes of Evra, Ferdinand and Vidic. A pair of defenders who rarely changed and had trust within the manager and each other. That's what I was trying to highlight. 

An injury to Sturridge was awful bad luck, however that LFC knew the risk. Sturridge has a history of falling apart and that's where my blame falls with management. We built a team after Suarez around Sturridge. Another one man show. If it falls apart, so does the entire team. We screamed for depth. We signed new players. We never screamed for the same tactics or diversity. We signed too many players that in my opinion fulfill the same role within our system. Once teams figured out how to beat that system, we were looking at the firing squad.

false,SlyRatchet,eu,S-Yorkshire,"Hmm, I'd say that it is almost impossible for something to be totalitarian *and* be democratic (in the sense that most people understand the term). I wouldn't say that being undemocratic is a defining feature though. It only appears defining to us because we have the values of democracy instilled in us our entire lives. We're in a minority globally, in that regard.

I would say it is a step closer to totalitarianism, but I'd say we're still many hundreds of steps away from actually getting there. I mean, the banning of this sort of porn (and I'm not even sure it is a ban. IIRC it's just a ban on production, rather than consumption) is an infringement on what people do in their private lives, to an extent. But there are many justifications for government regulation of private lives which fall short of totalitarianism. For instance, paedophilia is considered to be totally illegitimate, as is recreational drug use of many forms, even though both of these acts don't *necessarily* lead to any other individual being harmed. They are both essentially self-regarding actions (google John Stuart Mill's Harm Principle of you want to know more).

There's different sorts of freedoms which are considered to be of varying levels of importance. For instance, the European Convention on Human Rights enshrines many Human Rights and Civil Liberties. These are considered to be totally unacceptable to infringe. Consumption of porn is obviously not one of them. They include things like right to life, right to family, right to freedom of expression, right to freedom of association (e.g. trade union membership and pressure group membership), right of assembly (protest), freedom from retrospective legislation (creating legislation which punishes people for things they did before the bill became law). 

However, there are some people who claim that these rights *are* being infringed, in some ways. The now retired human rights activist Mr Mansfield QC argued that because of the intense regulation of protests by the police since Thatcher, that right to freedom of assembly was essentially being curtailed, and that the government was infringing people's rights. Very much worth looking into. There's also the British government's long time insistence that prisoners should not be able to vote, despite it contravening the *human right to vote*. Spying also kind of goes down that right, because one of the rights of the ECHR is a 'right to a private life' which is curtailed by surveillance. And the rendition flights that we have supported the USA in. The British government is certainly complicit in torture (which is illegal under international law) and perhaps perpetrated it itself. 

So porn isn't really that important in the grand scheme of things. There's a lot of other, far more significant problems. Again, I don't think we're actually totalitarian. Most of the ECHR stands strong and is respected, but we also need to recognise that we should be doing better. We shouldn't take pride in ""not being totalitarian"". That would be taking pride in not being the absolute worst that we could possibly be. A lot of our rights are being curtailed at the edges, and that will only lead to curtailment at the centre as well. They're called human rights, not human maybes.

You have come to the conclusion that I am not calm, I am angry and I have high blood pressure and that I am really young, all from a couple of reddit comments, you should start a website where you charge people for that information. I of course will not stoop to your level, I will avoid questioning your emotional state and your current health status as I feel that would make me  ignorant and of course it is irrelevant to the current issue.

&amp;nbsp;


In the United Kingdom, there are of course doctors that are not General Practitioners I did not insinuate otherwise.

&amp;nbsp;

I will give you a direct quote from wikipedia:

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;A primary care physician or primary care provider (PCP) is a physician who provides both the first contact for a person with an undiagnosed health concern as well as continuing care of varied medical conditions, not limited by cause, organ system, or diagnosis. This term is primarily used in the United States, although this is a recent occurrence. In years past in the US and in Britain (and many other English-speaking countries), the equivalent term was/is “general practitioner”.

&amp;nbsp;

In the Eu report they refer to all PCP's as Doctors, and in the case of the UK, that includes ""General practitioner"".

&amp;nbsp;

In Europe depending on the country a ""General practitioner"" is a ""Doctor"".

&amp;nbsp;

In Europe depending on the country a ""Doctor"" is also a primary care provider.

&amp;nbsp;

In Europe depending on the country a ""Doctor"" is also ""General practitioner"".

&amp;nbsp;

The Eu report address this issue and informs us that they are referring to all PCP's as Doctors.

&amp;nbsp;

I proved that this was the case, by comparing the data of the number of GP's per 1000 pop. in the UK with the number of Doctors per 1000 pop.  in the EU report, and the data is indeed matching up, which confirms that the EU report is referring to the number of Doctors per 1000 pop.  in the case of the UK as meaning the number of GP's.

&amp;nbsp;

Please tell me how knowing the actual number of licensed GP's in total changes any of those facts or helps in anyway without having other data to reference it against. If you were to try collate this information yourself it would be redundant as that has already been done by the EU health report.

&amp;nbsp;

-----------------------------

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;there's nothing wrong with my maths. If you think there is, point out where.

&gt;You can take the EU figure of Doctors in the UK per 1000 population, multiply that out: comes to about 176,400 by my calculations.



&amp;nbsp;

You took the EU figure of Doctors in the UK per 1000 population and you ""multiply that out"" what exactly is ""Multiply that out""? and how did you arrive at the figure of 176,400.

&amp;nbsp;

I showed you the correct math and the correct data in the last post, but I will type it out again in case you didn't bother reading it.

&amp;nbsp;

The report http://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/data-and-charts/gp-numbers-relative-uk-populations

Number of general practitioners per 10,000 in all the countries inside the UK from in 2004 - 2011:

&amp;nbsp;


England 6.8 

&amp;nbsp;

Wales 6.7  

&amp;nbsp;

Scotland 8.2  

&amp;nbsp;

Northern Ireland 6.1 

&amp;nbsp;


Total number of GPs per 1,000 in 2011 in the United Kingdom = 2.71 per 1000 population.

&amp;nbsp;

The Eu report says that we have 2.80 Doctors per 1,000 in 2014;

&amp;nbsp;

Eu report - 2.80 Doctors per 1000 in 2014.

&amp;nbsp;

Uk report 2.71 GPs per 1000 in 2011.


1. I am not shouting, please show me where I was shouting.
2. I gave you the proper data, you are either failing to understand it or you are trolling me on purpose. You come back with the proper data to support your claims because so far you have failed to do that.

The Tardis is actually made of Rice Crispy blocks and is really heavy.  I couldn't bear to eat it.  [**Here it is this morning**](http://i.imgur.com/J0XvfOS.jpg).

This was only the grooms cake btw.  Hers was the traditional tower. 

But all that is good must come with some bad.  I also had a set 'Seal of Rassilon' [**cufflinks and matching tie clip**](http://i.imgur.com/uEY5qV2.jpg).  But I won't be recommending this product to anyone unless the seller makes good on them and modify's their welding practices [**because of this**](http://i.imgur.com/qN04VD5.jpg) ...  Within an hour or so of putting them on, both spot welds on the clips broke.  I hadn't even left the house yet and had no cufflinks.  So I piled on the hotglue nice and tall and flash cooled them on ice to harden the glue.  They lasted the night but of course I had to be semi constantly aware of their fragile state ensuring I bumped into nothing or didn't even rest my arms on anything.  The etsy seller was greatly accommodating in overnight shipping them because my wife forgot to order them in time, and I got these specifically because all the other cufflinks were that tacky printed image behind a clear button crap and I wanted molded designs which were quite a bit more expensive.  The only reason I can see for them breaking like this is them either not using flux or using low heat welds so  as to not discolor the fronts.. I dunno but it was added stress I didn't need. :p

First off, this is hospitality I'm not quite sure how other jobs will be like but I guess it would be the same. I switched jobs from an apprenticeship to a zero hour just after Christmas last year as I got paid £150 a week for basically doing the managers job (coming in early hours to set up, placing orders, sorting out part time employees wage), getting no tips and doing 50 hour weeks and while I was in the position of the 0hr contract I constantly wished I didn't change jobs.

One week I'd get full time hours, the next I'd get no hours at all because another employee has stolen all mine. It got better towards the end because I had more responsibilities but not by much. Other employees constantly complained about how I got more hours, I was constantly in fear that I'd come in one day and I'll have all my shifts cancelled.

Now I'm in a stable job, full 35hr contract, staff benefits, an actual HR department, etc. its extremely weird and is still hard to adjust but I'm getting there.

But 0hr contracts will never disappear as long as there is students around.

Did you see Liverpool and United today? Liverpool made United look better than they are. Unpopular opinion maybe but I think De Gea is heavily over rated. He's good, especially for his age, but the way some people bang on about him like he's the fucking Messiah is a joke. He's been good this season, he was okay last season, before that he was wank and fans wanted him out. He's been good for half a season and they're that desperate that some people have talked about offering him £200k plus each week. For United at the minute I can't blame them for not wanting to lose him but seriously some reds need to put their cocks away and watch other goalies for a bit with a level head. Brendan Rodgers - what was he doing today? I literally don't understand what was going through his mind when he made that starting 11 up this morning. I think he's shit though so United turning Liverpool over today kind cheered me up, hopefully he'll be sacked in the morning.

Secondly, Arsenal and Newcastle yesterday. What the fuck? I watched the second half (so I'm judging it only on that) and Newcastle had no players going forward and nobody defending. Where the fuck were they? Did they think it was an 8 a side match or something? If they were all packed in the midfield I must have missed them. Furthermore we've been linked with their striker Cisse - something that I would hate to see. Firstly; let's see if we can get Guidetti back from Celtic, let's pair Pozo up with somebody, failing them two let's bring in a couple of lads from the EDS. Furthermore Cisse would only be brought in for the short period our other strikers are out for and upon their return would become dead wood.

Thirdly, saving the best bit till last now. Does anybody else just sit and laugh every time they hear the Steven Gerrard chant? It's not even in the Liverpool matches alone this season, it seems to be every match. Always makes me laugh 


EDIT: People in /r/soccer still banging on about De Gea and a lot of them are full of shit.

Doesn't look like he's on his feet there but planted to the ground. And them fucking lines.. Jesus Christ. The first photo; he's going to his left and in a split second or so a large part of the left side of the net will be exposed. He's committed. The second photo, well any decent striker would chip that into the right side of the net.

It is irrelevant whether I am pro or anti independence. The point of doing that was clearly to invoke scottish patriotic/national feelings by using locations and language related to an important historical event and a scottish folk hero. He is drawing a similarity between his declaration and the historical one by doing it in Arbroath and saying all the other stuff he does in the article.

I'd say that is ""invoking the Bruce"", or as close as you can get without saying ""I'm a modern Robert the Bruce"".

I am anti-nationalism, I think it is a artificial construct that was adopted to fill the religion and feudalism shaped hole that emerged in the 19th century onwards. Nationalist movements can be a ""lesser of two evils"" but should never be the ultimate goal.

I know it is a cliche to quote the Communist Manifesto but on this particular topic it sums up my thoughts pretty well:

&gt;The working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they have not got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy, must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the nation

The Scottish independant movement offered nothing that seems like it would achieve what I think of as important, it was merely a changing of which elites ruled. It doesn't seem to matter what nationality they are in the grand scheme of things and making nationality and geogrpahy the key issue rather than equality means it is a nationalist issue first and foremost. Which just makes it silly and pointless.

The key to real positive change for the ""average person"" is solidarity, not further divides over silly national differences.

The comparisons you're determined to ignore are a long way from "" Nazi Germany had beer, green grass, helicopters, and a whole bunch of stuff we have too."" (and BTW, I'm pretty sure they didn't have helicopters - that was a Russian invention that was further developed in the US by defectors IIRC).

[**EDIT** - it seems the development of helicopters started earlier and was much more complex than I realized - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter#Early_design) - and ""Nazi Germany used helicopters in small numbers during World War II for observation, transport, and medical evacuation.""]

There is no clear line where you can say ""these abuses should be tolerated but anything more is suddenly evil"". The more abuses you allow, the more abuses you'll get used to and bored with - precisely how uncomfortably warm the frog is right now is pretty much beside the point. Especially to the actual victims of those abuses.

Still, since you don't like comparisons with Nazi Germany, how about a quote from an American - ""The price of freedom is eternal vigilance"" - Thomas Jefferson.

Both Labour and the current government have been far too lenient when it comes to immigration, which is sending a terrible message to people from elsewhere.

Look at the recent situation in Calais: people risking their lives to hide under trucks to get into the UK or forcing ferries to close the loading bay and gates. 

I don't agree with the current visa situation where a British person has awful trouble trying to get their foreign partner into the country, which just tears apart families and is no good for anyone. 

I'm also against leaving the EU because I work for a company which employs lots of foreign techs and without them we'd be half the size we are now.

BUT, I constantly see people in boroughs of my city doing stupid shit like that woman who was jailed last week for promoting terrorism and saying how much she hates the UK and British vales. If you think that then why the fuck are you here? It makes no sense.

Tower Hamlets in particular has some serious problems right now with not only people patrolling the streets trying to enforce sharia law, but the mayor himself is undergoing investigation for alleged bribery, corruption and intimidation of potential voters. Not to mention the issues in other parts of the country like Birmingham, Bradford, Rochdale and Cardiff.

To put it simply, if people want to move here they should integrate, respect and enjoy British values, and not create mini versions of home like bloody Southall. What's the point of that?

I want to see more control over these things, stricter testing of ability to integrate such as better English tests, and closer monitoring of these test centres so they can't pay someone to do the tests for them. I'd also monitor colleges/universities more closely because it's well known that many are just fake and the ""students"" end up disappearing.

But i work out near Weston and have to occasionally move large things (including my pregnant wife.... shhhhh.. i didn't say that) through the city and it is awful. Cycling infrastructure is incredibly important in a city like Bristol, but not at the expense of motor vehicles. it needs to be a tandem effort.

Public transport is a joke so that is out also.

With both my cycling and motorist hat on.. as a rule, cyclists in Bristol are awful (massive brush tarring here).... i know if i'm cycling  i follow road rules, wear a helmet, have several decent lights front and back as well as reflectives + use cycle paths if they are there or stick close to the side of the road if i can.... unfortunately most in Bristol just don't do these things. Yet if they were to get hit by a driver it would almost certainly be fingers pointed at the driver with the mornings and evenings now being dark i drive like someone completely paranoid at this time of the year, because i have nearly hit so many cyclists that have just not been visible.. AT ALL (black bike and clothes with no /incredibly poor lights) which isn't fair on me.... but this digresses from the point.

The constant speed limit changes increase congestion and and vehicle emissions. I would just like to see consistency in speed limit down the portway. as you have said, it's an arterial route with heavy flow... it must have a decent speed limit to keep that going. 

Speedlimits, traffic flow, traffic lights and bus lanes all need to be very carefully reviewed to get the city working properly. e.g on the Bath road by the Totterdown bridge there is a small stretch of bus lane inbound that serves no purpose apart from holding up traffic. 

I'm pretty sure we are singing from at least mostly the same hymn sheet here.

false,philipwhiuk,null,null,"&gt; The people running this system seem scared to replace their old fashioned system with something more modern so continue carrying a very old fashioned and expensive technical risk which they could probably cure with a modern system.

I'm sure there is gradual replacement and modernisation. Remember this code has to be fault tolerant, by which I mean it has to fail safe. It also has to work, with very little downtime or upgrade ability.

You are aware this is not a NATS issue right? Legacy systems exist in every industry. Banks still use FORTRAN and Cobol. If you're in web, well we are getting there, but there's not much history for much legacy and there's very little system critical web stuff. 

Telephone systems rarely fail and are also ancient. The fines from governments when emergency calls don't go through are sky high.

Yes it crashed. But it also crashed in a way in which absolutely no inflight incident occured. No planes lost automated computer navigation in way which meant they'd collide at the end of a runway. Maybe a thousand flights were delayed or cancelled. Not that serious.

BlackBerry had a 2 day outage in which every single device was unusable. Multiple banks have had issues where accounts are completely accessible for half a day or more.

Legacy systems are a huge problem. But ""replace it all with fancy new technology X that hasn't been battle tested for more than 3 months and currently runs a few social media sites"" is not a sensible answer.

PS: I'd add that I saw reports that the failure of the flight server was due to a power outage (a tweet from Heathrow Airport). But I don't have much confirmation.

PPS: Post reading the article, it is clear they are modernising the system. The explanation makes sense and it's unfortunate but it's also not a catastrophe. I'm sure there'll be lots more improvements and a root cause analysis and both the system itself and future systems will be hardened against the double failure that occurred.",0,1418578920,null,0,1418579409,0,cmun9pi,t3_2p6s4s,t1_cmun9pi,t1_cmuij9n,null,1425438298,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

* Space - You're going to need a big venue to be successful. If you're wanting people to stay a long time, then how are you going to extract money from them over that time, vs having a high turnover which is how cafe's usually operate?

* Board Gamers - How will you accommodate this group of people? Will you ignore them entirely and focus on video games? 

* Coffee shops - will you be wanting to compete with coffee shops? 

* Pubs - will you have an alcohol license? Will you also be competing with pubs? I.E What is going to make people come to you, rather than the pub. 

* Research - How are you going to reach out to game designers in the area? Are you aware enough of the local networking events etc that you will promote, or simply attend?

If I'm honest it's an idea I've had quite a few times too, but usually 'given up' on the idea because of the amount of factors involved. The concept is great, but I think it's a very steep curve in order to succeed. My main concern would be the cost of renting a place big enough to make it successful.

false,muffinheart,null,null,"You're thinking about the industry all wrong. You don't need a degree to get IT jobs in Belfast. It's a lot harder, granted, but not impossible. There are apprenticeships. 

Graduates get hired all the time, mostly via the company who took them on during their placement year. 

Your point about not having the experience or qualifications for job postings is silly because a lot of places will still give you a chance even if you don't have the experience. Especially if you're a grad.

If you don't have a degree then you need to make it clear in your cover letter and CV why you think you're still qualified for the job. You need to mention skills and experience relevant to the employer. Things like ""I made a cross platform mobile game that has 200 concurrent users, it uses technologies X, Y, Z"".

Degrees may not be the best indicator of ability but they're a very good starting point for jobs that require an advanced skillset. 

So if you don't have a degree or relevant experience then I'm not sure why you're complaining about the difficulty for getting IT jobs, because it's fairly easy if you have those pre-requisites and not impossible if you don't.

Just out of curiosity, what makes you think you could work as a software engineer?

Asher's themselves have even claimed the same thing. Now you're saying it's because of 'conscience' and 'freedom of speech', which are very different things.

Let's start with freedom of speech. Your right to freedom of speech does not give you permission to oppress someone else's freedom of speech - so claiming freedom of speech in this case is just plain wrong. Asher's has the right to say they are anti-gay all they like but the law does not give them the legal right to prevent someone else from saying they are pro-gay. Now, if the cake message had been pornographic or obscene in some way the law says they could have refused - but it wasn't.

If this whole issue is in fact not because they objected to being associated with the message and was instead because of their conscience, then it's because they objected to the people they were serving. Our law states that you cannot discriminate against a consumer who is black/gay/trans/disabled etc. Refusing to sell to someone because they are gay, is discrimination - hence the suit being brought by the Equality Commission.

Direct Democracy - Proportional voting, national and local referendums, so voters can be engaged and have their say heard

MP Recall - A procedure by which voters can remove an elected official from office through a direct vote before his or her term has ended

Less interventionist foreign policy - UKIP would significantly reduce military involvement in foreign conflicts

Localism - Devolving power from Westminster so communities have more say in how they're governed

A cessation to mass, uncontrolled immigration - UKIP will adopt a policy similar to Australia with a points based system &amp; work visas.

No taxation on minimum wage earners - UKIP will increase personal allowance to the level of full-time minimum wage earnings (approx £13,500 by next election)

End to the bedroom tax

Free university tuition for certain courses - UKIP will remove tuition fees for students taking approved degrees in science, medicine, technology, engineering, maths on the condition that they live, work and pay tax in the UK for five years after the completion of their degrees

A ""bonfire"" of laws and regulations

Reintroduction of grammar schools

This is a really difficult one again, because how many people die in any form of detention scenario.  The police have to deal with all kinds of people, some addicts will tell you (as they themselves might feel) that they are dying, experiencing the worst pain in the world.  Other people, may have been in an altercation, people die from one punch, hell I remember a cautionary tale about a pilot who had a *hard* landing, so much so the undercarrage buckled, he walked away fine to die a few hours later, negative-g and the human form don't mix well.

&gt;the wrong they should be allowed to get away with it because in different incidents similar actions have been beneficial.

Think of it as least worse.  If they could make improvements, then suggest them.  Sadly the police are often forced to play a game they know is stupid, I've met more than one officer who is of the opinion that the war on drugs is a dangerous affair, yet they still have to enforce it.

They have to act on intelligence, if they believe someone is armed, then sadly, those risks will apply to the situation.  One death too many thing is very unfair, because frankly most activities have risk, weaker road users are at risk the whole time because of some drivers, yet we still allow cars.

To really understand, we need to see the deaths in context.  Sure we're a lot better than say the US, but we don't have half their crime problems either, so it's not completely fair to compare.

8: Technically yes, realistically no, so lets call that a maybe. We are officially a Christian country, but act secular.

9: Nope. Heck the Unions have had more power in deciding the leaders of parties than any corporation.

10: Nope. The amount of recent strikes suggests that this isn't the case.

Harry Kane has proved as of late that he can handle the solo striker position. 

 As much as I am not a supporter of Lennon, he may be our best option out on the wing at the moment.  


Erik Lamela and Christian Eriksen have both proven their worth as CAM.  Lamela likes to cut inside which he cant do on the wing as effectively as he likes.  He is in the wrong position as of late, which is why we see a dip in form.  

Eriksen likes to pick out the perfect pass and does so very well from the central position. 


 Nacer Chadli proved he can score and even though I have him on the wing, he seems to find himself in goal scoring positions which is why he needs to be on the pitch. 


 Dembele is a hard sell for most, however, I love his ability to hold the ball and act as a holding midfielder.  However, ideally I'd like to have Capoue there when he's healthy.

We do have a good IT industry, its one of the very few things going for us, I thought I mentioned that but I might have forgot, if so my bad. 

On experience, I'm not talking specifically about IT but a lot of other industries and careers. Its still the case that a lot of graduates can't get internships because of the competition. A graduate cannot compete with someone who has a doctorate. I've been looked over for jobs and low paid internships this year in favour of people with PhDs, 3 this year, 2 last year, and these opportunities don't come up that often.

Till they become 18, they are basically just training with the forces and can leave at any point. Only once they turn 18 are they are locked into a contract and have to complete their minimum service time.

Unless it has changed you also need a parents permission to join the armed forces before you turn 18.

Though the fact anyone still calls him Brendao makes me cringe, Other than 2/3 players has Rodgers with his vast amount spent ever impressed really?

For context I used to live in South Glos, but moved away from Bristol 4 years ago. I have also cycled in the city and others.

I recently drove down Gloucester Road on a Friday night, I've done it many times before. With the new 20mph speed limit it was positively scary! 20mph isn't very familiar, 30mph I can probably maintain without a speedometer. With the threat of speed cameras all over the place, I am glancing at the speedo every second. I've got a taxi on my bumper because apparently they didn't get the memo. Invincible drunks walking into the road from between parked cars without a care in the world. Cyclists with no lights are now overtaking me because they have nothing to fear from speed cameras. Then there are the zebra crossings that I'm monitoring and the umpteen traffic lights that change on a whim.

In the pre-20mph days I'd still have most of this to contend with but I wouldn't be worrying about my speed, if I was doing 30mph it would feel dangerously fast. I'd probably be hovering around somewhere around 20mph but without the threat of smarty points on my licence for straying to 23mph.

At the end of the day speed limits are limits not targets, motorists (and cyclists) should be travelling at a speed between 0 and the limit that is safe for the current road conditions. Problem is you can't enforce that with Gatso cameras.

Ian Ayre and co. lose out to teams like Chelsea, City, Arsenal, United, etc. because we are fundamenfally not like them. They have huge stadiums with endless bank accounts and recent trophies to entice better talent. Its not for a lack of trying, it's just common sense. 

Maybe you would call this ""small club mentality"" but unless foreign oil royalty steps up to buy our trophies it's silly to have these expectations of sacking and hiring every couple of seasons. I don't think that's what long term success is about anyway. 

So we are left to pick up the scraps and deal with scenarios like Sunderland and Borini. We have to deal with Sturridge's inconsistency and Balo's immaturity. We have to sign three players from one club and set the stage for irony. We are stuck between the sad reality of modern football and the unpredictability of the EPL. 

That being said starting from scratch again seems to me like the makings of destruction.

I don't know why everyone is crediting him with what happened last season. Last season we did so very well because we had Suarez. Suarez gave everyone hope, and was the main driving force behind the title race, with Stevie right behind him. Rodgers made no lineup errors because there WERE no lineup errors to be made. Basically the same lineup started week in, week out. The most Rodgers could to do tamper with the lineup was switching up Allen/Henderson/Gerrard/Lucas/Coutinho in the midfield, and that wasn't a lot to do. We had a very clear starting 11 and bench because of our lack of depth.

If I were to be a bit bold, I would even say Rodgers might have cost us in the title race. Against Chelsea we set up to win, when we clearly only needed a draw against. After the first ten minutes when it was clear Chelsea was playing for the draw, Rodgers could have easily set up the team to fall back and take the point. Instead we end up losing, which put us behind City in the title race, barring any errors. Another one that comes to mind is the match against Palace. 3-0 up, we set up to go on pushing for more goals far too aggressively, leaving almost no defenders behind, just to chase an unrealistic dream of closing that goal difference (we had to score something like 7 MORE goals?). Then, Crystanbul. And the title was pretty much gone at that point.

I would say Rodgers was never a brilliant manager to begin with. Without an inspiring run of form led by Suarez, who showed passion, aggression and desire, last season would have fallen apart just like the season before and this one. Rodgers is now showing his lineup and tactical mistakes when he actually has depth to work with, and isn't practically forced to start the same starting 11 every game.",0,1418586635,null,0,false,0,cmurf17,t3_2pa65d,t1_cmurf17,t3_2pa65d,null,1425436362,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

Whoever is in charge of transfer policy is incompetent. If that's Rodgers, he needs to go. If it was these chaps that came in from Man City, they have to. Maybe it's lot of them.

Anyone who thought it was OK to start the season with no replacement for Suarez and no cover for Sturridge needs to be shown the door. Anyone who thought Mignolet, Balotelli or Lambert was the right kind of player for the type of football Rodgers was trying to establish at the club is not capable of overseeing our transfers. I never really found out who it was that thought £35m was a reasonable spend on Andy Carroll, was that somebody who is still involved? Because that was the same mistake: good striker but not suited to the way we play and signing them was pissing away millions of pounds and years out of their careers.

Spurs got a lot of criticism when they sold Bale and signed a raft of players - but no real stars - and the manager didn't know what to do with them. They've also been criticised for firing managers in rapid succession, when the real problems have been with Daniel Levy and the way the club has been running player recruitment. When, in the summer, we were all a bit worried at the suggestions that we might be 'doing a Spurs' by signing a large number of mid-price players with the Suarez money, I fear that we've been 'doing a Spurs' in a broader sense by allowing recruitment to be disconnected from footballing philosophy.

The club is set up wrong. We need a single vision (or 'philosophy') of what Liverpool football looks like. What attributes does a Liverpool goalkeeper have? A Liverpool forward? etc etc. Then whoever is in charge of recruitment knows what sort of player to get, the people in charge of he academy know what sort of player to develop, and the first team manager knows what sort of player to work with.

At this point I think the only answer is to bring in a Director of Football to oversee all of this. This would effectively be a demotion for Rodgers as well as some of the people on the transfer committee: swallow your pride or don't let the door hit you on the arse on the way out I reckon.

Don't confuse what's in the news with what's typical or reflects real life.  By definition the news is extraordinary and atypical - if it were ordinary and typical, it wouldn't be newsworthy.

&gt;BUT, I constantly see people in boroughs of my city doing stupid shit like that woman who was jailed last week for promoting terrorism and saying how much she hates the UK and British vales. If you think that then why the fuck are you here? It makes no sense.

Don't fall into the trap of thinking that government can ever distinguish horrible people from the decent majority in any policy.  Some people on welfare are going to be morons, some immigrants are going to be morons, some pensioners are going to be morons  People can sometimes be morons  Realistically, the state is not going to ever have a mechanism for filtering them out - they can usually lie their way through and you'll just end up filtering out the honest innocent.  

&gt;I want to see more control over these things, stricter testing of ability to integrate such as better English tests, and closer monitoring of these test centres so they can't pay someone to do the tests for them. I'd also monitor colleges/universities more closely because it's well known that many are just fake and the ""students"" end up disappearing.

Not really specifically a UKIP policy. That's more about wanting better administrative competence, but there's no reason to think you'd get that more from UKIP.

&gt;To put it simply, if people want to move here they should integrate, respect and enjoy British values, and not create mini versions of home like bloody Southall. What's the point of that?

You can take it to normal managers, Would managers the likes of Big Sam take the complete complacent looking plays from individuals today? You don't need to be legendary to inspire belief and light a fire under players arses.

We literally were the ones who told Remy the deal was off, his signing was in the bag had we decided to close it. After a medical we pulled out but never really gave reasons why.

Regarding having to be Balo's immaturity we most certainly do not, We chose to sign him knowing 100% what he was like. There are other known entities abroad such as Son, Icardi and others who maybe don't have the reputation of Balo performance wise but from what we've seen would have done a better job without the attitude.

It's about looking at the longterm though and saying is this what we need long term? Without SAS would Rodgers have changed to 2 up front? He was forced almost into it by their form. We had no major injuries, no mid week games, other teams underperformed and we had the best 2 strikers you could wish for yet for all that he could never shore up our defence and we still didn't win anything.

Now teams are onto the fact we can't break teams down easily and we struggle to score with noone looking a natural finisher except Sturridge.... hopefully.

You can cut it however you like the first season was nothing above average probably more likely below if anything and this season is shaping up to be a fucking shitshow both in terms of our style (if we even have one) and results. You never really know what lineup he is thinking as a fan and it keeps changing so much seemingly not based on performances you're left to question if he really does have it under control.

ALl this after a summer of looking like he wasted most the transfer budget, over £100 million and people act like because we want stability we can't get rid of him.

I would like very very much for someone with the capacity to do a highlights package for Fazio attempted challenges, blocks, interceptions, positioning, passing etc from that match. It was just shocking. Positional work so poor (playing people onside, too far off dangermen, slow feet/adjustments), dreadful passing, very slack in terms of concentration. It was frightening to watch.

Even for the goal, he blocks a shot going wide with his arm and it drops to Bony, who he's standing too far off.

For all his criticism, a bad Kaboul game lately is a dominant performance with a clumsy challenge in isolation. This was poor technical defending throughout, and he is *not* looking capable of partnering Jan, who did well today. Jan and Kaboul is still the best we've got. Vlad and Fazio are a little way off both, even ignoring the number of times Faz has already been sent off for us in his short Spurs career.

&gt;In [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics), a __register__ is a [variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(linguistics\)) of a [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language) used for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting. For example, when speaking in a formal setting contrary to an informal setting, an [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language) speaker may be more likely to use features of [prescribed grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_and_description)— like pronouncing words ending in *-ing* with a [velar nasal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velar_nasal) instead of an [alveolar nasal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_nasal) (e.g. ""walking"", not ""walkin'""), choosing more formal words (e.g. *father* vs. *dad,* *child* vs. *kid,* etc.), and refraining from using contractions like *[ain't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ain%27t)*.

Last season, with Suarez scoring a decent number we still didn't look like a league contender until after the New Year. Our great run of form almost directly coincided with Rodgers moving Gerrard into the deepest lying midfielder role (a role he has never really played in his career before, so hardly obvious), and utilising his passing in order to become an even more direct attacking outfit that complemented the pace of our attack. Rodgers's tactically refined the team over the course of the season in order for us to have our best run of form in over 20 years. I'd also note that our best run of form also coincided with Suarez's worse run of goalscoring form. We became much more reliant on Sturridge and Sterling's goals in the back half of the season.

As for him not having to use his squad, would you say that playing Flanagan (first at right-back and then at left-back) was an obvious managerial decision considering that he hadn't played for the best part of a year and a half before Rodgers brought him back in? I certainly don't remember anyone crying out for that no brainer of a selection

He gets criticised for the Chelsea result but that was a fluke error by Gerrard that ruined everything, not the larger gameplan. Actually watch the first half back, we weren't really trying to force the game or going gung-ho at all. Gerrard slips in a position that he'd collect the ball 999 times out of 1000 without issue and we concede. Our shape at that point was no different from the team shape that most sides in the league will be in a dozen times in an ordinary game. It was an awful twist of fate. Then we had to go gung-ho because we had to chase the result.

Crystal Palace: when they get the 2nd, Rodgers changes the team shape in order to make us more cautious and solid. He brings Moses on for a knackered Sturridge in order to allow us an outlet to hold the ball up in their half more and stopping it coming right back at us like it had for 10 minutes or so. Skrtel fucks up on a long-ball and let's Gayle in, we lose the lead. But fair enough, he made a mistake pushing too much when we were leading. Manager's aren't infallible and I'd rather a manager be punished for being too positive than for trying to hang on like a David Moyes type manager (which is actually partly the reason why we conceded the third today, we were pushed too high to try to get back into the game).

You're being ridiculously simplistic either because you don't understand football, or because a more nuanced understanding of our performances last year would conflict with your agenda. Either way, I hate that last season has to get retrospectively tarnished when Rodgers played a major part in our best league performance since we won the thing.

Ah but the Moment is a weapon of ungodly power and decides to stop this from happening so in Day of the Doctor we see it rewrite time by grabbing these future, more heroic incarnations. Now it turns out the Moment actually broke the time lock in order to do that.

All our summer signings start on the bench or are letting the team down on the pitch.  Sterling is bound to leave in the summer unless we actually respect his future and give him a decent contract; it's bullshit that we are trying to get him to sign a 70,000 contract when he's clearly the brightest star in the team and he knows it.

BR will get until the end of the season and I don't entirely blame him for the way the season has gone down but he showed massive inexperience in the transfer market and WASTED a lot of money.  When are we going to have 100m to spend again?  Especially since we won't have CL bonus next year.

We call ourselves a big club but we run the club like we're a mid-table team.  I'm so tired of us relying on our past to maintain we're a big club.  We WERE a big club.  Every time in recent memory we have a good season we follow it up with a bad one.  I don't see a silver lining in the near future.  In my opinion Gerrard has been the heartbeat of this club through the last decade and the only presence that has felt familiar and Liverpudlian. Lord knows we're probably offering him a garbage contract that is more focused on him becoming a coach (which I don't think he wants to do for a while.)

Come the summer we could lose Gerrard and Sterling and have no heart left in the team.  The days of players like Alonso, Macherano, Sissoko, Gerrard are gone.

The fact that we took like 5 players from Southampton is just so LAZY and a testament to the fact that our recruitment system is broken.  We do better with a foreign manager that has knowledge of the corners of Europe.  We would be LUCKY to have someone like Klopp come in.

This result against Utd doesn't surprise me one bit but the screw is turning and unless something magical happens in January we will finish mid-table.  Our only hope would be getting knocked out of the Europa league and the FA Cup so that we only have the PL to focus on; like last season.

BR has to go, it's time to start from scratch again.

Any claim that it is possible is snake oil: The only thing that protects the privacy of individuals in the SAIL datasets right now is the limited distribution of the data &amp; the fact that the people that have access have no interest in de-anonymising it.

If you are anywhere near Wiltshire/Somerset, I am willing to bet he would be more than happy to come over. He's mobile so tends to potter off anywhere.

What year YBR is it? ~~Is it a manual or electric starter?~~ just saw your picture (again) - its a kickstart. My '12 YBR hasn't had a problem with the ignition in the time I have had it - the only time I have ever had what you are reporting is when I try and use the remote starter on my alarm keyfob. The YBRs need a little bit of extra work to get this working on them and when I did mine I didn't bother. If you don't have an alarm fitted, then it probably isn't this - but it could be a good place to start with the ignition circuit. A loose wire or connection could very well be the culprit.

**Edit**: One thing that had come up in conversation between me and my bike chap is that the older carb YBRs did have a problem when running in the cold. Apparently, the cold air getting to the carb chocked the flow of fuel and it caused all matter of problems. Unlikely to be the issue, as you say it does it when the bike is hot, but apparently even the cold flow of air over the carb used to do it.

Lovren was great at the start of the season, I loved his range of passing especially. Lallana was unlucky to pick up an injury at the start of the season.

Have you seen Sakho play for France? he looks FAR more composed for them.

It's kinda the sole responsibility of Brendan but not really... he controls the backroom staff and it seems like our goalkeeping and defensive coaching is utter trash.. players keep coming to us and getting worse, how is that happening?

We couldn't replace Suarez 1:1 yeah, but we did need someone who can score goals.. instead we brought in Balotelli who has a history of not being a big goalscorer apart from penalties.. why did the club not want to sign Remy? we said he failed his medical but come on that's utter bullshit. And what about Bony? why did Rodgers not want him.. £20m is pretty much nothing for a player like him.

Agger was definitely not ready to leave otherwise there wouldn't have been so much drama around it... the pics of him crying etc.. he still had a role to play at the club and Rodgers seemingly threw a pretty much club legend into the dumpster like he was nothing.


Lambert started 6 games in 18 days without being substituted once and you really think Borini shouldn't have been on the bench? and it's not hindsight when people predict shit and it comes true is it?

I would argue it is for the following reasons:

1) as we have the largest and most comprehensive data set which is nearly impossible to replicate, it would likely be the most valuable in the world and the money from licensing it out alone could pump an obscene amount into the NHS.

2) The worlds smartest data scientists would process it through the worlds most powerful super-computers and use algorithms to give us healthcare improvements that could save millions of lives globally and reduce costs drastically.

3) If we try and use it exclusively internally we will never maximize it's potential and as a result we will save less lives and have lower standards of care than we potentially could. 

4) As long as we legislate against improper use, the downsides are pretty minimal, we give out data about ourselves voluntarily everyday and get amazing free services such in return. This is just another form of different data.

&gt; but we nearly won the league, we lost our best player, and we decides to go and buy mostly young unproven players.

I see this a lot. That ""almost winning a league and what happened is unacceptable"" shit. We were overachieving last year. Is it that hard to understand? From 7th to 2nd is a rapid rise but we didn't have the squad to back it. We just hit form when others were underperforming. Stars aligned or some shit. We didn't magically get better squad than we had before. Remember the Newcastle side that got to 5th or whatever position? What happened to them after that season? We had something like that but in lesser scale. They had the season of their lives and couple of players that performed in key moments. But they didn't have a squad to back that season up. I'm sure their fans were disappointed for such a performance loss but their expections were too high considering their squad. Some act like we were THERE after finishing second and getting to CL - we were finally playing with the big boys again. Right? No, that's just the start. That's when we started the process of trying to sustain that level of performance, that process needs A LOT of time, it isn't happening overnight. Last year was one off, let's accept that. Remember, that this is only Rodgers' 3rd year as a Liverpool manager and he started from as midtable as we could've been. (don't let the current table fool you, we aren't even half way through) 

About buying players for NOW:

We haven't been an attractive club for top players for ages and it shows, this is also hard to understand for some. Yes, we did get 2nd place and CL but there's shit load of clubs in better state than Liverpool. You'll get better wages and better chance of winning trophies, hell you even get to live in NOT LIVERPOOL (looking at Sanchez). 

Of course we should be buying good players but if there isn't any available or they just don't want to come here, should we be happy with less good players or should we go for players who have much more potential to be great in the future? The younger players are usually more available to Liverpool. We have taken a direction of buying players who will be more useful later than those who are average and hard to get rid of. (Downing, Adam, Carroll and so on)

Don't worry about football managers' decisions confusing you. You (most probably) are not a professional football manager and don't know how these things work. We also don't know Rodgers' plans.

Every club that makes many transfers at once is gonna have some of that transitional period. Unfortunately for us the period was made harder for us by losing two of our best players.

Virtually everything that could go wrong has gone wrong. Bringing in someone new might have some short term gain but wouldn't solve the fundamental issues with the club. 

In my opinion, the biggest problem this season which has led to this mess (besides losing Suarez), is Sturridge's perpetual injury woes. He's injury prone, sure, but who the hell could have predicted so many in such succession? I know it may seem overly simplistic to pin so much on a single player, I just can't help but look at our 3 draws and think, Studge probably could have been the factor which got us a scrappy 1-0 victory. If we were just 4-6 points higher on the table, we'd be in and out of the top 4 with West Ham, Southampton, Arsenal, etc. We really should be better than a team languishing away at midtable. 

Despite all the other issues, and they are valid, if we simply had a handful more scrappy points on the table we'd likely be having more mild conversations about the merits of Rodgers' 'system', or defensive problems, or the lack of a competent GK.

Mario likes to receive the on the edge of the box instead of getting himself in there.

&gt;She has recently been up the bletchly for the celebration of the unsung up there. There is also one of their historians coming down to interview her. We also gave them the record pad for incoming messages she had as well as her ID papers and some other personal items.    
It is bittersweet for us because about 9 months ago her dementia got so bad that she was unable to live alone, and her more modern memories are fading (she still thinks I'm at school) but her memories about that are so far good. Aditionally my mum knows less than us grandkids, as my gran used to look after us telling us the stories in the late 90s, where as she could tell my mum nothing in the 60s.    
she once told an amazing story of when she was covertly tracking on a german sub in the channel (somwhere near the wash) listening to all their messages. They also then had some downed bristish airman on a raft in the channel. They could only listen as the airmen reported their heading was right towards the sub but they could do nothing. Luckily a change in the weather led the airmen to go west rather than south and they were going well. She never got to hear if they made it to safety but just imagining being on the wireless set listening to all that really brings home the personal stories that were going on in these big times. (I think they managed to courier a message to a nearby base to try to pick them up as they came nearer shore).

This entire entry is just the writer bitching about how the rich and posh live, whilst using the singular evidence of *one* nanny sticking her finger up the arse of a little child for potty training, and then tarring the whole minority of the rich and posh denizens of the UK as people who accept child abuse. What the fuck.    

&gt;   Because the extravagance on display in the pages of Tatler magazine fuels the trickle-down greed which causes the suffering of those further down the line.   

What the hell is the point here? Tatler *is* for the rich and posh. It always has been. For over 100 bloody years.   

Bloody hell. You might as well slam something like ""Private Plane Monthly"" or whatever. *Obviously* the target audience is for the wealthy. So why slam it for it? It's like slamming a Rolex Catalogue because it doesn't cater for the underclass.   

&gt; The real crux of the matter is, that behind all this very expensively highlighted hair and whitened smiles, if the upper classes need to store up all their money to splurge on sparkles and pugs and sideways horse-riding in order to distract themselves from the gnawing internal agony of not being cuddled by their mothers enough or having strange women insert digits into their infant backsides, then I am afraid it affects all of us. It is not ok.  

This is literally based on **one** person's experience, and this writer has smeared the entire readership of Tatler and all other rich and posh people.  

Ridiculous. This is the tl;dr version:

Rodgers is so obviously a charlatan. He seems like he might be able to vaguely inspire a team already in cracking form, having an opportunist's silver tongue and knack for saying whatever he thinks might please the listener. In other words, his forté is in sustaining a good run, which is one of the least crucial skills in management as it largely takes care of itself. He can give a good Aragorn speech to rouse the troops, but he's a woeful general at the actual battle.

He seems largely incompetent in any other aspect of management, from public relations (which does matter) to tactics and transfers. It's all hopeless with him and he has repeatedly embarrassed the club -- the Real Madrid cowardice made your club look a joke that no longer belongs at the top level, no matter whether or not that's actually the case.

Suarez was amazing last season, and Sterling/Sturridge hit great form as well. Most of Liverpool's accomplishments were down to that fact, but the media attributed a lot of it to Rodgers for no real reason, and he lapped it up. He had the luckiest break of his life and rode that horse until it keeled over. Now it's dead, and he has no idea what to do because the thing that carried him through last season is no longer there.

He's such a questionable character. A slimy bastard, really. Notice his post-match interviews -- managers are expected to defend their players and such, but he routinely claims the complete opposite of what happened out there. Always insisting the team played well, always claiming to have been unlucky or that the result (when bad) was not deserved. Inexplicably praising Gerrard whom he seems blindly infatuated with.

He's making so many horrible mistakes. His lineups are awful, his substitutions are bizarre, he's driving your best young talent into the ground and gambling with his future. He's playing Gerrard like he was 25 again when he's of an age where he should be used with moderation to stabilize the latter parts of matches or lend his experience when things have gone awry. When played for 90 minutes twice a week, he's a gigantic liability.

There's not a single thing, not *one* thing that seems to justify him as manager of a team trying to claw its way back to the top. He's inept, he's dishonest, he's a bumbling amateur at times, and he's practically stealing a living at this point. He seems like a man who has conned his way into a job and had the incredible luck last season to have great performers disguise his faults.

My own one seems to be accruing about 4% interest a year.

It was only about 3 years ago when I was 28 that I actually started earning enough to be paying off more than the interest that was being put on every month.

This is why I am so against the current state of student finances... For a 3 year degree you're getting a minimum of 27k for tuition alone, not to mention your means tested actual ""student loan"" which for me came out at around 13k.

That's FORTY FRICKIN GRAND OF DEBT as soon as you walk out of your graduation ceremony.

Now add on the interest, and even at the 1.5% you seem to be being charged (per one of your other comments), 1.5% of 40k is £600, meaning £50 of interest is going on EVERY MONTH.

Now let's assume that you're paying it off at a rate of 9% of everything you earn above 21k (which I believe is correct for recent graduates) - You need to be earning a minimum of 28k STRAIGHT OUT OF UNI just to be earning enough so that you're paying more into your student loan than the interest that's being added every month.
