My insurance (24/f full license) is £175 and I'm sure that wasn't the cheapest option. I bought my current ybr for £750 off gumtree. It's a very good example of a 125 but it is still just a 125 so don't expect miracles.

**Dorian Johnson**

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown, was walking with him in the street. Johnson said that Wilson pulled up beside them and said, ""Get the fuck on the sidewalk.""[68][69][70][71] The young men replied that they were ""not but a minute away from [their] destination, and [they] would shortly be out of the street"".[71] Wilson drove forward without saying anything further, only to abruptly back up, positioning his vehicle crosswise in their path, almost hitting the two men. ""We were so close, almost inches away, that when he tried to open his door aggressively, the door ricocheted both off me and Big Mike's body and closed back on the officer.""[31]

Wilson, still in his vehicle, grabbed Brown around his neck through the open window.[38] Brown tried to pull away, but Wilson continued to pull Brown toward him ""like tug of war"".[72] Brown ""did not reach for the officer's weapon at all"", and was attempting to get free of Wilson rather than attack him or take his weapon from him.[69][73][74][75][76] Wilson drew his weapon and said, ""I'll shoot you"" or ""I'm going to shoot"", and almost instantaneously fired his weapon, hitting Brown.

Following the initial gunshot, Brown was able to free himself, at which point the two fled. Wilson exited the vehicle, after which he fired several rounds at the fleeing Brown, hitting him once in the back.[31][71] Brown turned around with his hands raised and said, ""I don't have a gun. Stop shooting!"" Wilson then shot Brown several more times, killing him.[31][53] Johnson's attorney stated that Wilson did not attempt to resuscitate Brown, did not call for medical help, and ""he didn't call it in that someone had been shot.""[7] Johnson told local TV stations shortly after the shooting that Brown had been surrendering[77] when Wilson opened fire without cause or warning.

Johnson's attorney, Freeman Bosley, stated that Johnson had confirmed with law enforcement his and Brown's roles in taking the cigars prior to the shooting incident.[54]

**Piaget Crenshaw**

Piaget Crenshaw said that, from her vantage point, it appeared that Wilson and Brown were arm wrestling before the former shot Brown from inside his vehicle. Wilson then chased Brown for about 20 feet before shooting him again. ""I saw the police chase him ... down the street and shoot him down.""[79] When Brown then raised his arms, the officer shot him two more times, killing him

Regardless of what your tabloid-trained instincts might be telling you, you *just don't know*.

It's not like every paedophile in the country wears an identifying badge so you can spot them, and so when one comes to prominence *specifically because* he's been caught grooming or abusing actual children you therefore can't possibly properly contextualise their numbers in a meaningful way.

Instead rhetoric like yours is not only ignorant (in a perfectly literal sense - you have *no idea* about the numbers, but are insinuating a claim nonetheless) - it actually actively contributes to the existing and counter-productive witch-hunt atmosphere that *stops* some paedophiles from coming forward and seeking treatment for their condition due to concerns for their interpersonal relationships, freedom or even their lives.",0,1416955670,null,0,1416956596,0,cmd1mjh,t3_2ne2kv,t1_cmd1mjh,t1_cmcx3sm,null,1425841001,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Lastly, it doesn't matter how many times you call it ""meagre"". Ill try and simplify this one last time. Pensions are by far the *largest* expenditure in the welfare budget and by and large they go to the most affluent demographic in British society. There is nothing ""meagre"" about it. 

Means test it by all means, but a universal state pension as it currently operates is unaffordable, unsustainable and unjust.

Even assuming those daily users send only 50 words of text privately to each other that's 4.32 billion words to read a day. 

The average person can read 200 words per minute.

I don't agree I'm afraid, particularly with the first point. You really have to distance Unionism from those who represent it. What I believe is happening is the death throws of 'old' unionism. A last charge up the hill against modernism. DUP/UUP must change, and it will take time, but moderate elements will prevail. Meanwhile at castle greyskull, the shinners will continue to prevail because they play the game well. They're like the sneaky cunt at school who like poking the fat kid, except they know just where to poke and how hard to avoid getting punched in the face.

As for the UI, well that's another matter and in the hands of us all. If we want to put a number on a 'lifetime', lets say 50 years. It's not inevitable by any means but also not impossible.

 [**Confirmation bias**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation%20bias): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Confirmation bias__, also called __myside bias__, is the tendency to search for, interpret, or prioritize information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses.   It is a type of [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias) and a systematic error of [inductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning). People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a [biased way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias). The effect is stronger for [emotionally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional) charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs. People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain [attitude polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_polarization) (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), [belief perseverance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_perseverance) (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and [illusory correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_correlation) (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations).

Why others couldn't have suggested the same, I don't know. Keeping it simple is the easiest way to communicate at times.

If Ripple has one advantage, it is that it can be in the background later and then incidental to the service provided. That could be a big advantage if services can be simple for mainstream to use.

Hopefully, the outcome of the [UK.gov's call for information](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/digital-currencies-call-for-information/digital-currencies-call-for-information), will see them enabling services and giving everyone more reason to engage cryptocurrencies.

Well since you replied ""Yes it bloody well is"" to someone saying ""for a couple of hours of decent entertainment? It's not unreasonable!"" I'm compelled to think you mean that cost for any entertainment regardless of type is unreasonable. 

Now we've established you're just quibbling over film prices, but would presumably pay £10 for other forms of entertainment, yes? The obvious question to follow is why film is worth less to you... 

&gt; £10 is not cheap when for an extra quid you can have a full on IMAX experience. 

Perhaps, though not all cinemas have an IMAX facility and depending on location and viewings it may be more convenient to go to a non-IMAX. If you save a couple of quid in petrol costs by driving to a cinema that hasn't got the IMAX - you break even in terms of money spent and still get to see the film. 

&gt; That doesn't mean I don't think someone saying £10 a ticket is cheap is off their tits.

Heh, that's just like... your opinion, man. 

More to the point you refuse to comment on any of the other £10+ activities I mentioned so shall we assume you only do activities for under £10? 

I'm just trying to make sense of your decision making process here, it doesn't make sense to me. I'm not saying ""love the cost"" but if you do do other things that are the same cost - there must be other reasons you find it unacceptable.

(As the apocryphal exchange goes:

American tourist: Excuse me, is this college pre-war?

Porter: Madam, this college is pre-America!)

On the subject of old buildings, there's also Ely cathedral, if you are willing to leave Cambridge itself. It's a fairly short train journey, and well worth the visit if you are here long enough for it to be worthwhile...

If you want to go to a pub in the evening, the Eagle is touristy, but it has serious historical appeal -- including graffiti from British and American pilots stationed in Cambridge during the second world war. The Fort St George is also historically and architecturally interesting, and probably somewhat less touristy. If you want to take a break from the history, the Pint Shop and the Brewhouse both serve excellent and varied beer, and there are many other excellent pubs around the city.

**Willian** did great but I think he should improve his decision making in the final third. Considering his immense technical skill and that 5 yard acceleration, I think he should do better. There is one occasion when he got through at the penalty box and instead of shooting, he tried to pass first time to Hazard but got intercepted. Also there's another occasion when we are counter attacking with 3 (Him, Hazard, and Drogba(?)) against 2 defenders but wasted the good run of both players by picking up a wrong pass. In my opinion, he have great potential but really need to pick the right pass and be more decisive.

It's a shame to get a flippant reply to what I think is a very important point. Why on earth do we see influence (in a few tiny fields to boot) as a good way to judge the efficacy of an education system. It's lunacy.

When my children get to school age I hope their teachers don't see making them influential as their ultimate goal.

&gt;the belief is its the best education and the best preparation for life whether you want to be rich and successful or just content.

I don't buy the latter point.

&gt; I don't see what's so weird about asking them to share some of their secrets where it might help others.

I don't think there is much that is secret about the education in private schools. Do you think they have a secret formula or something? A special way of imparting knowledge? Obviously not.

* running a permanent deficit is unsustainable, even though if growth is &gt; the interest rate because sooner or later a recession will come along to baloon the deficit

You mention the export of the BBC. I have no knowledge of their financial transactions, but one would assume syndication rights are non gratis.

Today I have watched no television. In fact I would go so far as to say that I have not watched any live broadcast in over a week. My viewing being from Netflix, plex, kodi and the likes. I have a television subscription service I may cancel soon as it doesn't work around what has become my on demand viewing. As you don't require a TV licence to watch non live broadcasts I would at this point be able to cancel my licence. My only reason to consider maintaining a TV licence is because the cost is negligible to the inconvenience of the visitors.

One thing a lot of people don't know about TV licensing visitors is that you don't have to tell them anything. When they ask if they can come in you can refuse. They can be pushy, but you can call the police. The self protection laws in this country are a joke. Having spent time in America and having handled a firearm.

You are dramatically underestimating the complexity and cost of tunnelling. The Gotthard Base Tunnel is only about 35 miles long and yet it took 15 years to dig and if completed on schedule another 5 years to fit and finish. Of course, because there's one tunnel in each direction and service tunnels too, they actually dug almost 95 miles of tunnel, or more than 2 and a half times the length of the route. Now bear in mind your tunnel is ten times as long. Either you spend decades on the thing or run like 40 TBMs at a time at a truly staggering price.

The problem I have with this article is the simplification of the issue, whereby it blames all of these problems on cuts and the government. If it had told us the total all the benefits this person or someone in their situation is receiving and how it has changed, then an argument could be made to increase specific areas across the board or areas we should be campaigning to change.

The problem is that the benefit system is so complicated that it is difficult to know if this is an issue with the amount issued across the board or if it a specific case of someone/certain people being so highly in debt that servicing or other circumstances are putting them in poverty.

I may be wrong on this but I assume they receive housing benefit, council tax, child benefit, tax credits, DLA, carers allowance, PIP and possibly other I don't of which added together should be a fair amount to live of? I actually have no idea to be honest. If somebody is able to work out what they would likely be receiving a month, we would at least be able to make a fair judgement on the issue, without finger pointing and just shouting about how bad cuts are.

This is the exact same thing as the winter fuel allowance in that it's money being given to you for the purposes of heating your home. 

So why shouldn't this money be given to me in cash?

Any argument you can make for the winter fuel allowance can be applied to this refund. So why was this refund only given in vouchers to make sure it was used for it's actual purpose, and not the winter fuel allowance?

&gt; Well the problem is with that argument is that it leads to things like food stamps for those unemployed instead of money

No it doesn't. That's a slippery slope fallacy and clearly not going to happen because it's not a single direct method of payment for a single purpose. It hasn't happened yet and the government are already doing it with this rebate.

You get JSA in cash because that money has to be spent on many different things. Introducing food stamps in the current system of the department for work and pensions would cost far, far more than it would ever save. Not to mention the many different payment schemes the government would have to stick their finger into make this work. 

The government would have to change the system again to pay your rent, electricity, gas, water, and many other things to make food stamps viable. They would also have to address anti-competition laws depending on who accepts these food stamps.

When parents who can afford it take their children out of the state system they increase the amount of money in the state pot for less well-off families by [~£5bn](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2mrcwp/what_is_stopping_the_labour_party_from_being_more/cm6zr8l). They also remove over 500,000 children from state classrooms meaning there are smaller classes and better teacher:student ratios.

Most parents who afford private education do it at great cost. I was privately educated. I never had a holiday abroad growing up. I never stayed in a hotel. At home three of us would share bathwater. On the other hand, my cousins were state educated--they had a holiday house in Spain, bought a brand new house on a nice estate in the UK and their father drove a Porsche.

Now, sending private school teachers to help out in state schools is a very nice idea but who should pay for it? Parents like mine scraping everything they can together to send their children to a private school have already contributed a huge boost to the state system. They've also already paid the same taxes as everyone else. Why should they have to pay a third time?

As I've pointed out here many times before, this will lead to an increase in the cost of private education that will ultimately make it more exclusive and divisive.

You're smiling while you fight against the lump in your throat, as this mad, bad, beautiful man you once loved is marrying his rich Spanish heiress.

Your friends will always try and convince you that it was for the best, that if you'd stayed together he would only have hurt you again. No fixing a bad boy, they'd said. 

 But as he slips the ring on her finger, and they gaze happily each other, you know in your heart that it really should have been you. 

**EDIT 1** - 

Then you turn and look at your beautiful but slightly daft new Italian boyfriend, and pat his hand reassuringly. This is fine you tell yourself. 

**EDIT 2** - 

Later, at the dance, you know you should take to the floor with your Italian bloke, but you're sidled up to the bar instead. This is your third Old Fashioned. 

Your phone flashes, you're happy for the distraction. 

But its only your dad, texting you - *How is he? How are you? Chin up kiddo.* 

It's nice of your dad, you suppose, to be so concerned. But three Old Fashioneds in, it is easy to be angry at him, to blame him for this moment. He had pushed you to dump your ex - Other fish in the sea, he'd said. It's clear doesn't want to be with you, he'd said. And you'd listened. 

You realize now that maybe he himself had other fish in mind. He's dumped your mum and moved in with a woman your age. He's got himself a set of maddeningly white teeth. You don't text him back. It was his decision, you feel now. And one you always knew you'd regret, but you didn't think it would be this much. 

Six months on, here you are, at your ex's wedding, drunk and on the brink of acknowledging a bitter truth. A truth that has something to do with the best of your life having passed you by. 

Instead, there is the bitter sweetness of the Old Fashioned at hand, your fourth now. You hear tittering laughter coming from the general direction of the dance floor. It is your Italian bloke. He's made a scene - drunk, his shirttails out, he's tried his fancy footwork and failed miserably, falling sprawled on the floor. A pretty girl helps him back up to his feet and he throws a thankful arm around her strapless shoulder. 

You turn to see your ex and his wife whisper to each other and smile. Doing everything in unison on this awful night, they simultaneously turn to look at you, and send you the same pity-filled smile.

You stumble away from the bar. Somewhere here is that German bloke... the one you've been trying to throw yourself on ever since you first broke up with your ex. ",0,1416966570,null,0,1416973390,0,cmd6rht,t3_2nem9x,t1_cmd6rht,t3_2nem9x,null,1425838604,54,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,54

The BMW just sort of drones on, with such a linear delivery it's boring. 

The dashboard on the ER6n is better looking and I found the electronic suspension pointless. 
The standard setting was fine, the harder setting was just uncomfortable and made the bike more nervous. I guess it might be useful when riding two up.

The vast majority of 'gel' moisturisers simply have other occlusives in place of natural oils - often silicones which are arguably artificial oils. They are also comedogenic for some people, just as some natural oils are.

If you want a product that is entirely water based and free  of occlusives (waxes, butters, oils, silicones) you are talking about something that is pretty much just humectants. A serum not a 'true' moisturiser. You can't even have the major emollients (fatty alcohols, cationic surfactants) because they make a cream not a clear gel texture.

The issues then becomes whether a humectant only product draw water out of your skin in dry conditions (lower winter humidity, central heating, air conditioning). It seems to me when gel moisturisers are discussed over on SCA it's with the understanding that a sunscreen will be used year round which can add somewhat to the skin's protection against dehydration.

Here in the UK [sunscreen is not necessary year round] (http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/wiki/sunprotection), tho you may of course choose to do so. Do ensure you get plenty of bioavailable vitamin D in your diet.

3. at 10:30 You state the the English defeated half the Armada.
Th is technically not true, as the Armamda, AKA the Invicible Spanish Armada was one ship.
We may have destroyed half of the Armada ship's fleet, but we didn;t sink half a ship.

Minor infraction i suppose....

4. It should also be noted that the Armada battle was an amazing victory. but the way we did it was even better.
The Armada was invincible. It was heavily strengthened and cannons could not damage it.
The Armada sailed into the Thames, (A VERY DANGEROUS ACT!)
and we sat and waited for the ship to come into the river.
We then burnt around 10 or our own ships, and crashed them into the Armada. Making it catch fire.
It sank soon after.
The Armada was invicible to cannons, but it was not fireproof.
Simple thinking, with amazing results! We used that tactic many times afterwards!
it changed the way we attacked during maritime battles, and our tactics were definately enough to win larger opponents.

The Armada was very expensive for the Spanish to build, so we effectively bankrupted them after it's defeat.

At 22:25. we are very very aware of the Magna Carta.
It's a place in history and it was known throughout the enitre land.
As stated yourself at 23:12, the English parliment was born. 
It would have been hard not to know about it.

You should also mention the Oliver Cromwell, created the commonwealth.
It's important.

Imagine yourself in her shoes - if 7th July 2005 happens again you get shit on because it was your job to prevent it and (presumably she feels human emotions) she would feel terrible. She would be privy to every tiny detail of every poor person who died and, afterwards, to every potential piece of evidence unavailable to security services because of civil liberties and then you'd have to go out and be professional, explain the situation, how you're solving it and why you didn't prevent it. It would be without exception the worst week of your life. 

My guess is that she's responding understandably out of fear and worry by ensuring to her own satisfaction that it is impossible for a terrorist attack to happen - that is after all her primary job; she's not minister for civil liberties though she is put in the awkward catch 22 of having to protect people's liberty (from her own potential actions) and also having responsibility for preventing terrorist attacks. The trouble is that she's taking the security side of the job much more seriously because to her it doesn't really matter if people feel like they are being treated like suspects and are not able to establish a private life apart from state spying provided we prevent a terror attack. And she doesn't have anyone questioning her. The balance struck between information capture by the security services and civil liberties is decided in her head not at some contentious meeting between differing positions. There is no minister for civil liberties or minister for human rights to complain to her - she is the only person who can restrain herself and she's chosen not to restrain herself and there's no-one to stop her. Hence security state.

Case2.i) Score stays 1-1 and the team moves on based on penalties

ii) If both teams score the same amount of goals City goes through on away goals in head-head

false,TranshumansFTW,eng-dorset,Dorset Expat in Aus,"It's like the difference between having rape fantasies, and actually raping a person. 

I'm an ex-professional dominatrix, and rape fantasies aren't uncommon in the scene (mostly maledom, though they rarely come to dominatrixes for obvious reasons). However, just because a person has fantasies of taking an unconsenting girl by force, or being kidnapped and abused against their will, it doesn't make them a bad person and it certainly doesn't make them a rapist.

The same applies to paedophilia. One can be a paedophile without being a child molester, and although it does seem to be less common just having fantasies is not in and of itself a crime. The real difference between having rape fantasies and having paedophilic fantasies is how these can be expressed. When you have fantasies of, for example, kidnapping a man and abusing him, you can probably find a consenting adult roleplay partner on the internet to roleplay with, and that can be your outlet for these fantasies. It's much more difficult for paedophilia, since children can't consent and wouldn't understand even if they could. So, there are fewer outlets for these fantasies and thus they're more likely to commit an illegal act.

I'm not defending the actions of paedophiles, which I find to be abhorrent and are rightly condemned. However, it's unfair and unjust to assume that everyone with fantasies involving children will result in their becoming a child molester. Fantasies involving illegal activity are just that, fantasies, not real. Many people are suspected of having some level of sexual attraction to children (actual numbers are unknown for obvious reasons) and simply don't act on them. What's needed is some way of helping those affected either remove these fantasies, overcome their desires, or at the very least have some kind of outlet that doesn't involve children who could be hurt or psychologically harmed.",0,1416976886,null,0,false,0,cmdb9o3,t3_2ne2kv,t1_cmdb9o3,t1_cmcx3sm,null,1425836490,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

The ASA:
&gt; considered that the disclosure statements used, such as ""Thanks to Oreo for making this video possible"", either in the video or in the text descriptions, were insufficient to make clear the marketing nature of the videos ...

Also:
&gt; we noted that ads (a), (b), (d) and (e) only contained specific disclosure statements at the end of the video or in a text description that had to be opened by the viewer. Therefore, even had the disclosure statements been of a type that made the nature of the video clear, the fact that they would only be heard at the end of the videos or seen after consumer interaction with the video description, meant that they would have been insufficient to render the ads obviously identifiable as marketing communications ...

The other halls I know about, is east slope, which is next door to Brighthelm. That's the party halls. The cheapest, the dirtiest, and some Would say the greatest (if you're big into your parties). 

There Are some others as well, but I don't have much experience so I can't comment. I do know that my friend stayed in York House and absolutely hated it.

false,recchai,null,null,"I did one a couple of years ago. I think they're a relatively new thing, and I was told by a friend that it's based on the extended essay from the IB.Basically, you pick a project, research it, fine tune your ideas, realise that what you originally had planned is too big, scale back, eventually produce something (more on that in a sec), and do a presentation in front of your peers. Oh, and fill in lots of forms (back to this too).So, there are two types of extended project: the essay only in which you must write 5000 words, or the more practical one in which you produce something, like, say, a film, in which case you only need write a shorter essay. It was about 1000 or 2000 words, I can't remember, but should be easy to find out.Form filling, the most important part of the extended project. You have to write about your ideas at the start, at midpoints, and at the end. It's boring and frustrating, but it's how you show your progress to the examiners, and is what they're ultimately interested in. The extended project is about going through the motions as far as marks go. My advice with regards with that is to just do it at the appropriate points and then get back to the fun stuff (whilst doing it to the best of your ability naturally, as a lot of your mark depends on this).I really would recommend doing it. (mostly) it's fun, a different kind of experience and can be good for interviews etc. Do a bit of research and thinking about it in the summer, you'll thank yourself when you see people taking a bit too long to decide what to do. It was run very well at my college, and the 'teacher' always told us when we should be doing this and the other. I did it with AQA, not sure if any other boards offer it, but if you end hp on a different one, something to take into account.Ps.

The solution is to roll back the tax threshold, or make it means tested. The solution is to reintroduce the 50p tax. Also, tax loopholes for multinationals etc must be closed. That's the way to deal with the deficit. Also, incomes must rise so that more money sloshes around in the economy.

The food was taken to feed the British, food pantries were shut down when found out (part of the reason was that most were run by the Catholic Church), and the people were taxed so badly that their land was taken and given to British nobles. Apparently even the clothes on their backs were taken, and, if they didn't even have that, families were separated and placed on prison ships bound for Australia. The Irish people were reportedly so starving that they ate grass for nourishment. The lack of vitamin content in their diets led to deficient health that has been passed down to descendants. That's supposedly why I have depression and extremely soft teeth.

One issue you may run into is that of overseas knowledge. There will be very few advisers who would be confident/competent in dealing with Australian affairs. I'm sure there are some, but the scope of most advice by UK advisers is limited to UK affairs. Equally there are regulatory issues in providing advice when somebody is out of the country. There is a bizarre regulatory position where the advice must be seen to be given in the UK (i.e. demonstrate a meeting was held in the UK, or post documents to a UK address).

As of January 2013 all financial advisers must have an [NQF Level 4 qualification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Qualifications_Framework); The most common being Diploma in Regulated Financial Planning, or Diploma in Financial Planning. The differentiators, qualification-wise, are the title ""Chartered Financial Planner"" or ""Certified Financial Planner"", depending on which examination body is used. This is an [NQF Level 6 qualification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Qualifications_Framework) broadly equivalent to a degree.

There is also an issue of independence. The regulator screwed up the definition of independence, which previously was broadly understood by the general public, but now you can find a ""restricted whole of market"" adviser, who cannot call themselves independent because they don't advise on private health insurance, for example. Pre-January 2013 they would have been known as independent, and nothing they do has changed, just the regulatory definition.

As for cost, most advisers operate a percentage of assets model on an ongoing basis, with a minority offering retainer fees or pure hourly work. Costs vary, but I would expect the initial advice to cost ~ £500-£2,000 depending on complexity, with ongoing fees of 0.5% PA - 1.0% PA depending on service levels. I'd say this is probably ""average"" within the profession.

There are still product biases for those who used to be known as ""tied advisers"". For example, a large company such as Saint James' Place has a huge sales force, who call themselves financial advisers, but will only sell SJP products. Generally by finding a firm of chartered or certified financial planners you are avoiding this issue. These titles don't just relate to level of education - there are other ethical / business practice requirements.

Both of the listing sites on the sidebar are a great place to start, and can be filtered by qualification. As I would say to any person looking for an adviser, get in touch with two or three that look like they may be a good fit and speak to them.

Pretty sure advisers who are tied to companies or groups of companies need to say they offer restricted advice, so ""independent"" means whole of market.

Also, because of the big changes announced in the 2014 budget (mostly coming into effect April 2015), the government also announced that everyone coming up to pension age will be able to get some amount of free independent financial advice.

&gt;

&gt;The FSA had a priority of making retail markets for financial products and services work more effectively, and so help retail consumers to get a fair deal. Over several years, the FSA developed work to raise levels of confidence and capability among consumers. From 2004, this work was described as a national strategy  on building [financial capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_capability) in the UK. This programme was comparable to financial education and literacy strategies in other [OECD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD) countries, including the United States.

&gt;In June 2006, the FSA created its Retail Distribution Review (RDR) programme which they maintained would enhance consumer confidence in the retail investment market. The RDR came into force on 31 December 2012. 

&gt;The RDR is expected to have a significant impact on the way in which financial services are delivered to retail investors in the UK.  The primary delivery mechanism of financial services to retail customers is via approximately 30,000 financial intermediaries (FIs) who are authorised and regulated by the FSA. They are expected to bear the brunt of the force of the RDR. The key elements of RDR are:

&gt;


&gt;* Independent advice is truly independent and reflects investors’ needs.

&gt;* People can clearly identify and understand the service they are being offered.

&gt;* Commission-bias is removed from the system and recommendations made by advisers are not influenced by product providers.

&gt;* Investors know up-front how much advice is going to cost and how they will pay for it.

&gt;* All investment advisers will be qualified to a new, higher level, regarded as equivalent to the first year of a degree 

&gt;The combination of these factors is expected to significantly reduce the profitability of many FI practices.  In anticipation of the new regulatory environment being enforced the industry landscape is undergoing significant change. Despite the fact that many in the industry are considered to be poorly prepared for the changes coming into effect,  The most significant identifiable trends are:

&gt;


&gt;* Consolidators buying up small firms of FIs as a result of the higher qualifications threshold and downward pressures on profitability resulting from RDR - E&amp;Y estimate that the number of Registered Individuals will fall from 30,000 to 20,000 within the next 5 years. 

&gt;* IFAs are embracing the concept of [wrap account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrap_account) - incumbent fund supermarkets and Life Assurance Companies are in response launching their own Wrap Platforms. 

&gt;* IFAs are rapidly moving from the traditional investment solution for clients: recommending a portfolio of largely equity-oriented collective investment schemes ([Unit Trusts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_trust) and [OEICs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-ended_investment_company)) and being paid initial and annual renewal commission by the fund provider to an outsourcing model: recommending that clients appoint a discretionary fund manager to manage the client's portfolio(s) and charging the client an annual oversight fee. A recent survey found that 89% of IFAs are considering outsourcing to discretionary managers as a result of RDR. 

&gt;* Several new entrants are making major in-roads into this market   at the expense of the incumbent retail-oriented funds groups such as [Schroders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schroders), [Gartmore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartmore), [Fidelity Investments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity_Investments) etc.  The larger discretionary fund managers are finding it difficult to adapt their business models to cope with these changes, given that the small average portfolio size is better suited  to multi-manager (portfolio of funds) solutions,  via wrap platforms, when these fund managers tend to prefer to retain custody and investing in direct equities.

Fig 11 does indeed show that we've reduced energy usage, mostly since 2006 (red line).  Up until then our net energy use was increasing, which I guess kind of tallies with my mental picture of things.

Like, when the oil price really started spiking around 2006, demand destruction kicked in (2006 is I think still the year with most miles driven in the UK, plus peak electricity consuption) along with people suddenly trying to be as efficient as possible (average new car mpg has really shot up in the last 4-5 years).  However the dominant factor in the reduction of energy use is probably going to be the recession and financial crisis.

Quite.  Maybe they got robbed, or starved to death, or... those still of working age supported them.

I'm not trying to claim that childcare and education are worth more or less to society than pensions, but simply attempting to point out that pensions are not exceptional.

The cost quoted of raising a child includes education (though not private education) and childcare, both costs which are frequently borne by the state.  But you're correct in that only ~50% of the cost of raising a child is borne by the state. The costs quoted don't mention child benefit, healthcare and public facilities used by children, so the real costs may be higher.

The fact that pensions occupy a larger portion of the budget than previously is the consequence of improved health and longevity, the credit for which does not belong to those currently under ~30 yr old, but which they assuredly will benefit from, as well as any further improvements that they will bring about.

Furthermore, in the interests of balancing pensions received versus contributions made, one would have to take into account the fact that much of the pension budget goes to former military, education providers, NHS workers, and civil servants, all of whom contributed a portion of their income while working, and who therefore deserve a return.",0,1416994278,null,0,false,0,cmdg8hy,t3_2ncu8r,t1_cmdg8hy,t1_cmd1wr0,null,1425834102,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You're not listening.

Pensions *are* exceptional. They're exceptionally large, and take the form of payments from working demographics to the most affluent demographic that are mostly **more than able to support themselves.** 

&gt;much of the pension budget goes to former military, education providers, NHS workers, and civil servants, all of whom contributed a portion of their income while working, and who therefore deserve a return.

There is no return. National Insurance isn't an investment. It's a tax. Nobody deserves a return on it, any more than I deserve a return on my tax contributions that go towards infrastructure I don't use.

More importantly, they didn't contribute anywhere near enough to cover their state pensions. Not even close. 

More importantly still, as I've said. They are the most affluent demographic in the cotry and are more than able to support themselves.

I'm not suggesting we don't continue to help pensioners on the breadline with a means tested state pension.

I'm suggesting we stop rinsing poorer age groups to provide cash bonuses to pensioners who don't need them. That money could be better spent elsewhere.

Your demographic claim is not very convincing, since the data shown in the OP is that 15% of pensioners live in poverty (compared to 20% of the working population); this isn't a massive difference, and a reduction in poverty for any group should be welcomed, including for working people.

false,PopeGregoryIX,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"Since you're keen to dismiss using the classic ""eh, well it can't be racism because Islam isn't a country"", let's try a different example.

Did Guy Fawkes et al attempt to blow up the Houses of Parliament ""because they were Catholics"" or because they felt that Catholics in Britain were being badly mistreated?  

Again, the two things are linked. They wouldn't have done it if they weren't Catholics, of course. At the time, acts of terrorism were considerably more likely to be carried out by Catholics. Why? Because the bible tells everyone to kill protestants? No. Because they were the ones with the problems. Otherwise **all** Catholics would have been going about committing murders. 

Yes, Muslims are more likely than others to commit acts of terrorism in 21st century Britain, or rather those who choose to commit acts or terrorism are more likely to be Muslims. On that point you are probably right. But the reason is not that their religion tells them to. If there is a problem with their religion, it is that it does not stop them.

Do you not think it's a bit strange that this is something that has sprung up in the last 20 years or so? Do you think that the billions of Muslims worldwide have just been waiting around for the last couple of thousand years in spite of all the apparently irresistible incitements to violence that they so strongly believe in? 

Criticise the negative aspects of the religion all you want, they are obviously shitty and hardly anyone will argue otherwise. But that isn't what you are doing. You are ignoring all the other factors involved in order to blame only Islam (and by extension all of its followers) for the actions of some murderers.

Stop thinking about it as just £6'000/p.a then. Think about it as what it actually is £74bn/p.a

About 50% of the UK welfare budget is spent on providing pensions for people who mostly don't need them.

&gt;You claim that pensioners are rolling in money, which if it is true would mean that they are paying taxes on this massive income they have.

I didn't say they were all rolling in money. I said they're the group least likely to need state support.

&gt;Your demographic claim is not very convincing, since the data shown in the OP is that 15% of pensioners live in poverty (compared to 20% of the working population); this isn't a massive difference, and a reduction in poverty for any group should be welcomed, including for working people.

It's a massive difference. A reduction in poverty should indeed be welcomed for any group. 

Except that's rather difficult, when we're wasting money providing universal state pensions to pensioners who aren't in poverty.

&gt;The broader issue is the total cost of pensions, which has not risen due to overly generous pension payments, but to an increase in longevity, which is a good thing, and, incidentally, should also allow people to work for longer. 

The total cost of pensions has also increased due to a huge increase in the number of pensioners. Longevity isn't a solution because the retirement age has only increased 3 years. Which doesn't come close to covering the additional cost. 

&gt; If they work for longer, then the total costs of pensions should go down without plunging more pensioners into poverty.

The total costs of pensions is not going to go down. Pensioners working longer would just increase the number of people paying them. And it would be a drop in the ocean.",0,1417000581,null,0,false,0,cmdhc7a,t3_2ncu8r,t1_cmdhc7a,t1_cmdh66v,null,1425833586,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Last season Gerrard had space to quarter-back, but now he's closed down quick. If we got the ball into Suarez or Sturridge, the opposition would know something was likely to happen so they'd drop deeper - giving more space to our midfield. This season we don't have anything or anyone, anywhere on the pitch, that spells trouble. Sterling did for a while but either he's been sussed out or his confidence has gone - or both. It's not fair to heap all that expectation on him anyway. Moreno looks like he could but stepping out of defence doesn't end well for us. Coutinho and Lallana have looked good, tidy work, quick feet, but they've got to pass it and the ball doesn't stick with *any* of our front men.

The responsibility lies with *everyone*, the manager, the captain, the senior players too. What ever happened to our head shrinker guy?

Yes it does, time and time again in it's scripture and in it's history not to mention the fundamentalist preachers. It absolutely does call them to do things like this.

Except it hasn't 'sprung up' in last 20 years, it's been going on for centuries.

In India Muslims and Hindus have been killing each other forever. This isn't a new thing at all.

Personally I think there are alternatives to taxation, whether or not the are preferable is a different matter. Things like partial communal ownership of capital, land and natural resources and the processeds they generate etc. The latter two were never made by humans in the first place so it seems ridiculous that they can be entirely privatized. To me the need for taxation is largely a result of an out dated unequal distribution of property resulting in the vast majority of people being disposed. It's that has just evolved from feudalism, if we all had a greater share there'd be much less need for state provided services.

The current system is really complicated and should be simplified to the point that one 20 minute interview/form judges exactly what you are entitled to and makes that payment once weekly.

The current system is an absolute mess.  When I had to set up my claim for carers allowance it was a 30 minute phone call of questions like 'Are you pregnant?' 'Do you expect to be pregnant in the next 90 days?' which considering I'm male was a bit of piss-take.  All it seemed to do was generate the sending of some forms (not pre-populated with my answers to the phone questionnaire) which asked me exactly the same questions which I then had to post off and wait the requisite eight weeks for them to stuff it up and reduce my partner's ESA instead.

I'm totally with you about one overall benefit paid monthly (which is what I assume you meant).

I've found pictures where [the plates are missing](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03060/topgear1_3060923c.jpg), but also pictures where [the plates are on the car](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/4/1412421478489/Top-Gear-Porsche-with-con-011.jpg), so I don't know what that proves.

If you don't know the difference, it's probably because you don't want to. How would you react to someone accusing *you* of not using your money properly? Would you accept their criticisms as valid simply because they have less than you do?

&gt;These people aren't rich because they work hard

Some. Are you suggesting that's the norm? Who are 'these people'?

&gt;They are rich because society is set up to disproportionately reward some skills over others

Everyone is free to learn a skill they're good at that pays well. Everyone.

&gt;and because they were in far better socio-economic positions to start their business careers than others.

Some. Are you suggesting that's the norm?

&gt;there's absolutely nothing wrong with expecting them to pay for that privilege.

Absolutely - but it could be argued that they are already. It gets messier when you assert to someone else how *you* intend to spend their money.

&gt;I cannot even begin to get my head around people worrying about millionaires while there are children living in poverty.

Why? What are you doing, specifically, to help children in poverty?

There will always be those that waste, steal, all the outcomes of greed - but it's silly to lump them all together into an 'us vs. them' situation; we need a far, far sneakier approach for getting money out of them (simply raising taxes in the 70's didn't work, no reason to assume that doing so would be any different now)

EDIT: Yeah, there does seem to be a pattern where when you actually ask the us vs. them crowd to actually break down the group they're complaining about, it all goes quiet...even more strange is how nobody is allowed to blanket-blame any other coverall group (see; immigrants, people on benefits, etc.)...except for this one, because *that's different* (said every ignorant nationalist, racist, etc. - but that's everyone else, right?)",0,1417005049,null,0,1417526356,0,cmdi7a0,t3_2ngteq,t1_cmdi7a0,t1_cmdhikz,null,1425833184,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

But how much of the targeting is deliberate as opposed to opportunistic? This isn't always a premeditated hate crime like rolling a pigs head into a mosque. 

&gt; The violence towards the minority would not have happened were it not for the hatred against the minority, whereas the random violence would have.

I have real problems with this assumption. I suspect that those inclined toward violence are more likely to look for an excuse to commit it rather than those less inclined toward violence feel driven to it as a result of an individuals sexuality.

&gt; It also takes into account the isolation and terror minorities can feel, just by hearing about violence that is targeted against 'people like them' in this way.

Yet statistically aren't straight males more likely to be the victim of violence than any other demographic (even when taking into account lesbian domestic violence)?

&gt; Try here[1] for some more thoughts on this.

The blacks in America almost no social mobility, they have been the underclass for hundreds of years. This is partly racism but mostly a regressive culture that doesn't value improvement.

-- 

&gt; Is that not a fair point?

It is demonstrably the case that he **was** visible. It absolutely was possible to see him. If it's dark and raining then you need to pay extra attention to the road and you need to slow down. Dark clothing does not make one invisible, it merely makes one hard to see. Being a safe driver is reacting to conditions to ensure that if something does go wrong you are able to react in a safe manner. You did not do that.

Also, your vehicle has two bloody great flood lights attached to the front of it. They illuminate things. I can say with absolute confidence, that you could have seen him if you'd been driving slowly enough and paying enough attention to the road. 

&gt; I fully understand the severity of the situation.

I don't think you do. Your first reaction is to victim blame, which IMO is a sure sign of someone overwhelmed by the seriousness of a situation.

Your second reaction is to delude yourself into believing something that clearly isn't true.

&gt; he was no visible

Yes he was. No-one cycling down a road, and by your own admission with a rear light on, magically becomes invisible. 

&gt; Why is this such a hard thing to understand?

It is right that we should take higher taxes of those with the broadest shoulders but this is not the right way. I think just as people living in London often have no idea of the reality outside of the city, those outside of the city, have no idea of the reality of trying to live in the city. House prices and rent in London is already insane and adding further costs will just distort the market even further. The properties over 2m in London are often owned by families or rented by people in house shares and this tax will just be passed on to them. The things it certainly will do is empty the city of any middle class families, encourage all larger properties to be converted into smaller flats, put off people extending or upgrading properties, discourage wealthy people from moving here and be a nightmare to implement and keep on top of. It would make a lot more sense to increase the stamp duty over 2m to 10% and create a new band for over 5 million of 15%. 

This shows the sort of properties that will be affected and they are certainly not mansions, just typical house shares and family homes.

I would like to see a system like Denmark's used in the UK, where to buy property a person needs to be a British citizen or to have been a permanent resident in the UK for 5 years. Exceptions could be made if the person is going to be a permanent resident in that house, so your average non-British worker who wanted to buy a family home wouldn't be prevented from doing so. This would stop the ridiculous situation we have in London where huge amounts of central London property sits empty, gaining value for some overseas investor to sell for profit that won't be spent in the UK.

Yes, but that's not what hate crimes are. Hate crimes are really just highlighting that the motivation behind some actions require stronger punishments since the motivation behind certain crimes can have larger effects. 

When a gay man is attacked for being gay, the repercussions in the gay community are larger than the repercussions that would be felt in the community at large for someone attacking someone because they slighted them in the past. Gay people would feel fear, they would change how they behaved to obscure their sexuality, they would alter their behaviour in a way which they shouldn't need to. The person committing the hate crime may or may not be thinking that when they attack the gay man, but certainly those are the effects of his actions. 

Punishment should fit the crime. The crime causes more damage, therefore the punishment should be harsher. That's how I view the justification for hate crimes anyway. ",0,1417008028,null,0,false,0,cmdixsp,t3_2ngsu3,t1_cmdixsp,t1_cmdhtju,null,1425832840,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

The sheer fact they want you to sign on to benefits just so they can ""trial"" you via the JobCenter without paying you anything is awful in itself.

If they think so little of you that they want to treat you like that before even employing you, in the situation that they don't just dump you for another 30-day free labour, how do you think they'll treat you during your employment?

&gt;&gt;*[Starstreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starstreak) redirects here. For the Marvel comics superheroine named Starstreak, see [Julie Power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Power).*

&gt;__Starstreak__ is a British short range [Man-portable air-defense system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-portable_air-defense_systems) (MANPADS) manufactured by Thales Air Defence (formerly Shorts Missile Systems), in Belfast. It is also known as Starstreak HVM (High Velocity Missile). After launch, the missile accelerates to approximately Mach 3.5, making it the fastest short-range surface-to-air missile in the world.  It then launches three laser beam riding submunitions, increasing the likelihood of a successful hit on the target. Starstreak has been in service with the British Army since 1997. In 2012 Thales rebranded the system under the __ForceShield__ banner.

There's a fine line between ""hard to see"" and ""indistinguishable from their surroundings"", which amounts to invisible.

I actually almost took a cyclist out last winter. It was on a major A-road (60mph). I was doing about 45 as it was dark and it had rained (though wasn't raining at the time).

There's a steep hill on that road. As I went down, somewhere near the bottom I thought I saw movement. Nah, maybe a fox crossing the road. About 5 seconds later and a cats eye blinked. *Curious*.

Slowed right down, which was fortunate because I came up behind a cyclist:

* Black bike

* No lights

* No reflectors

* Dressed head to toe in black

* Had the hood on their black hoodie pulled up, blocking peripheral vision and limiting their spatial awareness

I have 20/20 vision, passed the medical for RAF Pilot training. I *could not see* that cyclist until they were well within my main beams - at the edges they were just a shadow.

The only thing I could see was where he crossed in front of cat's eyes and made them blink because he was weaving all over the fucking road. I only knew he was there by proxy.

If he gets run down (which seems quite likely), I desperately hope the driver is not prosecuted because it won't be his fault. If I die in an otherwise survivable accident because I didn't wear my seatbelt and went through the windscreen, that's not the fault of the guy who hit me - the accident is their fault, my death isn't. That's *my own stupidity*. Some cyclists have a death wish and it shouldn't be the responsibility of drivers to protect them. Give cyclists space, drive considerately and safely, but if people are going to play on an unlit road dressed in black then that's at their own damn risk.

When I cycle I have two rear red lights - one steady and one blinking, a ludicrous front beam, bike reflectors and a high-vis jacket. If I'm wearing my rucksack I have a couple of those high-vis arm bands that I loop into the bag's webbing straps.

The high vis is a personal choice because I value my life. Lights and reflectors *are a legal requirement*. If a cyclist goes out without them then they should be considered utterly responsible for their own fate.

In this case, even if the cyclist is somewhat negligent in their own clothing, if they had a light they were probably in the right.

Worthing is a bottleneck as it is in the south coast road network - with fairly reliable A roads and motorways from Southampton and Portsmouth slowing at Chichester due to roundabouts / traffic and then *really* slowing at Worthing due to the Broadwater roundabout and light system before speeding up around Lancing on the way to Brighton. 

The last thing they need is to slow that any more. 

Furthermore the rest of the town does not need 20mph universal limits - few of the roads lend themselves to fast speeds anyway. If anything the numerous elderly drivers and their lack of indicating / emergency stopping etc. are more of a problem. 

Areas around some of the schools could use a 20mph scheme - though that would slow things down, it might be worthwhile in the interests of safety (particularly during peak school arrival / departure times). 

I fear some of the main pushers of the drive to reduce speed limits are self-serving retired folk living in the Goring By Sea area.

On the beach-side road during the height of summer with roadworks (which there often are..) you'd be looking at half that.

My fees were paid, just the same as everyone else's were (in 1992), and I was given a grant to help with accommodation and food. I took a Christmas job and a summer job for pocket money and to pay the rent outside of uni term time. I had tons of spare time during term time to do whatever I wanted. And to study.

I have a friend who took a scholarship with the MoD which also meant he had a guaranteed job the year he left uni, something I wouldn't have wanted (I went into games programming). He was also dux of the university and something of a genius. It wasn't easy to get a scholarship even if you wanted one. I guess it will be the same with this scheme.

I've easily repaid the cost of my degree in taxes since graduation and I've made at least one company hugely successful as a result of my skills. In fact I think I've been influential to the success of several companies.

If I was 18 again and expected to make a choice between going £50+ grand in debt, or taking a job as something like a plumber or in construction, I wonder if I would have done the university thing. I have many friends from uni who probably wouldn't have gone to uni, and I would never have met them as a result. I wonder what they would be doing these days? Going to uni is what moved them out of their parents houses. How on earth folk are expected to ever save the deposit to buy a house is beyond me. 

The Tories are paying pensions but not paying for education. Got to Marks and Spencers and look at all the old folk. The last time we were in there it was packed out with 80-90% over 60s. The big companies dont need to pay any tax any more. That's something else that's new in the last 20 years. The newspapers have everyone in a hysteria about immigrants and terrorists while the Tories and new labour have sold out the next generation. Lets not even mention UKIP.

Its interesting to read the slant that the article puts on the story. First laying out what the new scheme is and then having an 'expert' saying how great it is. That's the BBC telling you what to think of the governments new great idea.

Watch out for this in other reports, where you get a commentator brought in to back up or justify the policy. It happens all the time on the radio. I dont watch TV news anymore.

These apprenticeships will probably come with clauses demanding a certain expectation to work for the sponsor company, probably for some years following graduation (presumably at unfavourable terms and rates)

false,SAMUEL_L_FAPSON,eng-buckinhamshire,Buckinghamshire,"I was simply responding to the study you linked. Obviously I'm aware that my anecdote is not evidence of any kind, but I'd like to point out that there are two reasons why there is such an extreme correlation between the class of parents and the class of their children:

1. At the time most people have children (age 29 is the average now I believe) they will begin to be settling, usually having gone through university or education and the job-hops of their early twenties, now beginning to build a family and securing more permanent, often lifelong careers. The point at which the class transcendence occurs is likely at university (getting in with the rich kids etc.) or at the early stages of one's employment, moving up the rungs of the class ladder alongside the rungs of employment, whether through promotions or as I mentioned earlier, job-hopping. 

2. Children contrast their parents in that they are not past the age of class movement, but too much younger than it. Your study gives the age 16 as the point when the class of parents and children was compared, so we can assume the average parents are approximately 45 when their child is 16 years old, at an age when both the parents are too old to effectively 'change class' and the children are too young, having likely not entered work or higher education. The children are still dependent on their parents, so the collective wealth of the family essentially determines their class. 

The study is basically trying to refute the idea that a young child gets their class from their friends, instead suggesting that it is from their parents (which is entirely reasonable). However I would say that a much fairer comparison would be the class of parents at the age of about 45, and their children's class *when at the same age*. I expect one would see a much greater difference in class between parents and children when measured at a similar age, because it gives the children the opportunity to ascend (or even descend) class barriers, which is simply not possible under the age of 16.

I think this is a hugely important part of the UK education system that increases mobility/social mobility. In Australia, nearly everyone goes in their home state.

false,BlueInq,null,null,"Here is a quick and dirty review of Park Village, based on my experiences of living there last year.

Park Village is the 2nd cheapest on-campus accommodation (£92 a week last year). The rooms are in little self-contained flats, 3 stories high, with 4 rooms on each floor. I really liked that we were in our own little house, it felt much more homely than other Halls of Residence where anyone could wander past or go into your kitchen. There are 2 kitchens per flat, so that means 1 kitchen per 6 residents, which is better than some other halls of residence. 

These flats were built in the 1960s, and some have not been renovated for years and years. The flat I lived in last year had not been renovated and it was falling apart slightly. The kitchen was especially grotty and I think the showers may have had traces of ebola. It really is luck of the draw if you end up in a renovated flat, so you would be taking a risk if you applied for Park Village. Some of the PV flats are much nicer.

Another downside is that there is no communal space in the flats, which really was annoying because it made it hard for housemates to socialise. In the end we set up some chairs and a table in the hallway so we could have dinner together!

One of the big positives is that the rooms are quite large for the price, especially compared to East Slope. This was the biggest positive about living in PV for me. 

One of the benefits is that there is a laundrette located in PV, which saves you some time and effort. Another benefit is that the heating is fantastic, the radiators are very powerful and the buildings were well insulated. Also, it is located fairly centrally on campus, all my lectures were about a 5 minute walk away. 

Basically, Park Village is a poor man's Brighthelm. If you love the idea of Brighthelm with it's semi-detached houses but don't want to fork out the cash then apply for Park Village and pray you don't end up in one of the unrenovated flats.

In reality it's just a set of Islamic rules that Muslims follow, just like the rules Jews follow, and the rules Catholics follow etc. It includes things like praying 5 times a day, and not eating pork.

It also contains some extreme and stupid shit like the death penalty for people who convert away from Islam. Just as with Catholics and Jews, most Muslims choose not to follow these extreme rules or interpret them less literally. But even for those that choose to believe in these rules, they cannot follow them in the UK because they are overwritten by our own laws and we don't allow punishment like this in the UK. If they don't like it, too bad, they live in our country, they follow our rules.

In this case, we're talking about specific Islamic rules about inheritance and burial procedures. Everything is still done according to British law. No one was condoning or supporting anything against British law. All they are doing is standardising the way their lawyers handle will requests from a particular religious affiliation. The lawyers will help them construct their will in a manner that follows their religious rules, as well as those of British law (which obviously takes priority if there are any contradictions).

No one is suggesting that these Sharia law additions will ever apply to anyone who doesn't specifically ask for it. They aren't being recognised as authoritative laws or rules, merely guidelines for special clients. The rest of us wouldn't even know they exist if it weren't for people making a fuss every time the word ""Sharia"" is mentioned. I really don't see what is wrong with that.

false,cabaretcabaret,null,null,"&gt;You mean to limit speed. It won't limit speeding. Speeding is the act of breaking the speed limit.

An average is just the most common speed. People can travel at 40 MPH in a 20 MPH zone and the average still be under 20 MPH.

Obviously 20 MPH limits aren't always applicable.

20 MPH limits only improve flow where cars bunch up, e.g. at junctions, in which case a 20 MPH limit actually increases the average speed. Where congestion isn't caused by bottlenecks like that 20 MPH limits only act to limit speed.

20 MPH limits should therefore be used where there's a congestion issue, or in areas where safety is prioritised. Outside of these scenarios, they are unnecessary.

My point is simply that in a town centre the vast majority of roads are likely to have congestion and/or safety concerns, so on balance, 20 MPH makes sense.

3) Agger is the only one that is a little troublesome, but he wasn't exactly always at peak fitness and that isn't really a diabolical quote. Just didn't feel like BR was being straight with him. Not exactly a vicious indictment.

Although yes, those are 'concrete examples' of the sort I asked for. But for every one of those you have Sterling, Sturridge and Coutinho's demonstrated liking for the manager.

which means they are consistently running behind, which means they are consistently under-resourcing and getting projects complete on the back of unpaid overtime from their junior staff. This is not a good company. Expect stressed out staff, poor organisation, crappy management and a poor product, high staff turnover. 

I do not know what advice to give you since it can be hard to get into a skilled job, I had some really crap roles just after graduation but I never stopped looking for the better job while working and moved each time a better opportunity came up until I felt I was in a company where the experience and training was worth it. 

If you decide to go for it set a limit for yourself on OT because they will not, make it known that you have a regular unmissible activity/responsibility on the weekend and never bend on that. You need downtime, no matter the deadline. Do not stop updating the CV, talking to agents, looking for something better. Unfortunately the adage is true, it is easier to find a new job while working.

Skrtel struggles in our defense, that is quite clear; he's very aggressive, and in the best CB pairings, you often have one aggressive and another to cover. We don't have anyone to cover, so Skrtels weaknesses are extra clear; however, his strengths are also very clear for all to see.

Let's not forget Skrtel was our 2011/2012 Player of the year. He's shown that he's a solid, reliable defender for us, despite initially struggling with the BR-system. Pair Skrtel with someone like Cahill and I'm sure you'd have one of the best CB-pairings in the league.

Obviously it is hard to see many of the Academy kids regularly, but there certainly is some talent there (personally from what i have seen i really like Winks and Onomah though haven't seen nearly enough to say what they may or may not be, have heard nothing but good things about a couple of the others as well) and in 4 years they should be hitting the 19-23 age group so you would *hope* a couple of them at a minimum would be in the squad and fighting for a regular slot in the lineup.

Anyway, when I went to check on him after the accident another woman had pulled over and was talking to him.

Edit: while I'm thinking about it, I think this ties in a bit to the other thread talking about Rodgers and a potential DoF.  I don't like the way Rodgers handles players on the fringes (or our youth players to some extent, but that's a gripe for a different post), but I don't entirely fault him for it.  Right now he's simply stretched too thin and doing the job of what normally would be at least 2 people for a club our size- both coaching the first team in a very hands on way and trying to define our broader play style and player acquisition strategy.  

If we had a proper DoF, BR would have more time on his hands to be able to work/speak with those on the fringes but, in fairness to him, right now I imagine he's running all day every day from coaching sessions, to opposition reviews, to transfer strategy meetings, to updates on the U-21s, etc, etc.  Even a very senior experienced manager would struggle under that sort of workload and the irony of the situation for me is that as much as he doesn't want one, an experienced, savvy DoF + a BR happy to work with such a person could be an incredibly great combination, allowing BR to focus on areas he excels at in terms of coaching and giving the club the clout and vision it needs to more successfully go after targeted players in a more cohesive manner.  Honestly I think the smart move by BR at this point would be to wholesale embrace and advocate the concept of a DoF at the club and use whatever pull he has left to try and ensure that whoever gets the position is someone he can learn from, respects, and more importantly work with on a regular basis, otherwise I do suspect at some point he'll become the victim instead of the proponent.",0,1417016810,null,0,1417020613,0,cmdmd94,t3_2ngk5v,t1_cmdmd94,t1_cmdm87y,null,1425831240,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

Either way, my reaction would not be to run to other people and have them tell me how it's not my fault. To ask for more ways to blame the victim. To look for legal loopholes to get away with it. To moan that no-one is listening to my story.

**Point-wise**: Point-wise we should be the best. We held the most points in the league among teams in Europe top leagues and we are the one of the only 2 teams in Europe top league that's still unbeaten, the other team is PSG.

**Goals for and against**: Taking both league and Champions League stats


Teams | For | Against | GD
-----|---|------- | ----
Real Madrid | 57 | 13 | 44
Bayern | 44 | 7 | 37
Chelsea | 44 | 13 | 31
Barca | 42 | 10 | 32
PSG | 37 | 14 | 23

I'd say we are somehow tie in 3rd with Barca, we scored more goals, but they conceded less.


**Performance-wise**: Disregarding points-based arguments and judging basely on performance consistency, I will not be able to compare as I have not watched those 3 teams play in entirety so I would not be able to make a fair argument. However, I do know that generally when we play amazing, we really look like one of if not the best top team in the world. Although, we do have some bad performances but still scratch a win. At the moment and current form, we look unstoppable so currently we should be one of the top 3 teams in the world.

**Conclusion**: Judging from point-wise and goals for and against, we should be the best team in the world OR at least 3rd best in the world.

White front reflectors and spoke reflectors will also help you to be seen.

&gt; looking for a loan that will just cover me until payday

That's a contradiction.

Anyway, if you're just looking for money for food have you tried to find a local food bank? Sometimes they require referrals from your local council but they'll let you know what you need to make it happen. Alternatively do you have any friends or family that could help you out? Alternatively, depending on your job, some employers will be able to help tide you over with a crisis payment of some sort, or you may have some co-workers able to help you out. Alternatively do you have a local church that runs any sort of program for helping people in bad situations?

If you've exhausted every other option then I guess you could consider a pay day loan (from a company like [Wonga](http://wonga.com)) but it's important to understand that these are exceptionally easy to get into a debt spiral with (and a casual ""it's fine! I'm getting paid soon it's easy!"" attitude **will** result in that) and the legitimate companies require good credit, if you have poor credit and start scraping the pay day loan barrel you'll end up involved with brokers that charge you fees and never actually give you a loan...

That's my point.  Whether you replace **x** with Black or English or video games or football or yoghurt* or what have you, it's implied by the use of the word ""culture"" that it's a generalisation that may not hold true for all the people you reference.

&gt;...categorising very different sets of people based on their skin colour alone.

Is objectively no worse than categorising pink and blue into boy and girl colours, it's just a metric for a generalisation, that without prejudice or discrimination simply is not racist.

Black culture is very much a thing, just as English culture is a thing.  It may be hard to pinpoint what it is that is meant by the phrase, and what is meant will vary hugely each time it is used, but to accept one culture is accept them all.

What's more racist? Acknowledging that black people may share some of many, varied, common reference points, or insisting that black culture isn't real because everyone's different, while accepting that English culture exists even though everyone's different?

false,EpicFishFingers,eng-Suffolk,Suffolk County,"&gt;This car was already on sale at a dealership and the number plates were (as is normal) obscured in the advert.

Any proof that it was bought from a dealership, and not from someone selling it? As if we look on AutoTrader or any other car sales site right now, most make no effort to blur out the number plates. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/3CgPV43.png) a sample search. [Here's another](http://i.imgur.com/dM5j0Of.png), and [one more](http://i.imgur.com/Blo5w1S.png). Notice many of those include dealerships. My own car, bought from a dealership, included the number plate. [Only if we search for nearly new or new cars](http://i.imgur.com/Blo5w1S.png) (which the Porsche 928 clearly isn't) do we see any blurred-out plates (and some shoes, for some reason), otherwise *not* blurring-out the plates is the norm.

Furthermore, do we know they were in the market for a 928, like you say? Because, as my ""pathetic"" pictures show, the other two cars aren't Porsches. Looks like some American green thing (I don't even know), and a Toyota MR2 maybe? What's the theme, generic sports cars? In which case they'd have a lot of play over what car to choose. Once again, I'll point out that they've used Clarkson in a 928 before, so they're going against convention of putting them in unique cars each time as well.

But for the sake of argument, let's say the number plate is blurred out, then a TG rep goes round to look at the car. They do their usual inspection, which I'd assume is pretty thorough, at no point do they notice the number plate. Car is handed over to the TG shipping crew who help transport it. No-one points out the plate. After possible several other people including camera crews, sound guys etc. having seen it, no-one has anything to say about the number plate, then they drive it around, the Falklanders get mad, and everyone acts shocked (including Clarkson, apparently). And I'm supposed to believe that scenario is in any way believable, and that at no point did the BBC think twice about buying a car with a number plate that could so blatantly cause offence? **I'm not saying I agree with the Falklanders, I'm just saying they shouldn't have had their heads up their arses**.

As someone else has said, many of the cars with this number plate combo will have been scrapped as it is an old-style number plate. This only makes it even more likely that the car was selected deliberately, as even fewer were about, so the odds of coincidence drop further.

Finally, my evidence is both more than the nothing (and insults to boot) that Morsrael provided, and the discussion was more constructive. Seeing as Top Gear are claiming they're innocent, if you're having problems with my claims, you either need to refute them or provide evidence in Top Gear's defence.

Reasons I don't think it's a coincidence:

* Number plate combo, others have stated that the style of number plate, binned in 2001, sees more and more cars scrapped every year, so it would be rather difficult to find a number plate with a specific gag in it. Hence, the odds of them accidentally doing so, plummet. Someone has calculated the odds of Clarkson accidentally getting the plate to be 1 in 10 million, now I realise that certain combos like POO and ASS aren't allowed etc., but I have previously gone over this and bartered the figure down to the realm of 1 in 100,000 chance, which is still astronomical.
* Top Gear's previous reputation: Slant joke in Burma, pushing the fully-functional Tesla car to undermine its rep, anti-cycling messages, various other claims of racism, proven or otherwise. Top Gear likes to be near the knuckle, and this wouldn't be the first time
* [The other number plates](http://images.dailystar-uk.co.uk/dynamic/1/photos/854000/152854.jpg). So they had a number plate gag lines up, but didn't notice Clarkson's current plate made a good gag? Fuck off!
* Theming between the other cars: what is the theme exactly? Not the same manufacturer, doubtful they're the same country, maybe rear-engined? Rear-wheel drive? Either way, they had a lot of play over what they could buy. Finally got hold of what the cars are: ""*Clarkson's Porsche, with the Lotus Esprit driven by May and the Mustang Mach I driven by Hammond*"". So, no country linking them, the 928 is front engine, Esprit is mid-engine, and the Mach I is front engine, the only thing I've found linking them is that they're all rear wheel drive with two seats, and sports cars. So they had a lot of choice in their cars, unless anyone can suggest anything more stringent that links them?

And the reasons against, are:

* Top Gear say they didn't know about the plates' joke, and state they ""did nothing wrong"", but they usually admit guilt.
* The car had the plate to begin with, which just means they bought the car for the plate, which isn't outside the realm of possibility at all.",0,1417024612,null,0,false,0,cmdq1j3,t3_2ngip1,t1_cmdq1j3,t1_cmdnhab,null,1425829457,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

 [**Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualifying%20Recognised%20Overseas%20Pension%20Scheme): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;A __Qualifying Recognised Overseas Pension Scheme__, or __QROPS__, is an overseas [pension scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_scheme) that meets certain requirements set by [HM Revenue and Customs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Revenue_and_Customs) (HMRC). A QROPS can receive the transfer of UK Pension Benefits without incurring an unauthorised payment and scheme sanction charge. The QROPS program was launched on 6 April 2006 as a part of new legislation with the objective of simplifying pensions. 

&gt;Typically this occurs when a UK resident leaves the UK to [emigrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigration) permanently (or to retire abroad) having built up a [pension fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_fund) within a scheme approved by HMRC or when a person born abroad who has built up benefits in a HMRC approved UK Pension Scheme decides to return to their home country with an expectation of retiring there. The QROPS does not have to be established in the new country of residence, thus providing greater flexibility and stability, along with choice of scheme provider.  

&gt;HMRC states that: 

&gt;&gt;


&gt;Under section 150(8) a recognised overseas pension scheme is an overseas pension scheme that meets the following requirements prescribed under The Pension Schemes (Categories of Country and Requirements for Overseas Pension Schemes and Recognised Overseas Pension Schemes) Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/206). It must:

&gt;


&gt;* be established in a Member State of the European Union, Norway, Liechtenstein or Iceland, India, and the United States.  (HM Revenue and Custom’s legislation on these jurisdictions is regularly updated to monitor and improve the system – with non-conformity meaning a whole country can be de-listed.)

&gt;* be established in a country or territory with which the UK has a Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) that contains exchange of information and non-discrimination provisions - see the list in RPSM14101046 (there is more information on the provisions of particular Double Taxation Agreements in the Double Taxation Relief Manual), or

&gt;* satisfy the requirement that, at the time of the recognised transfer, the rules of the scheme provide that:


&gt;


&gt;* at least 70% of the funds transferred will be designated by the scheme manager for the purpose of providing the member with an income for life,

&gt;* the pension benefits (and any associated lump sum) payable to the member under the scheme, to the extent that they relate to the transfer, are payable no earlier than they would be if pension rule 1 in section 165 applied, and

&gt;* membership of the scheme is open to persons resident in the country or territory in which it is established.

&gt;Pension rule 1 in section 165 provides that no payment of pension may be made before the day on which the member reaches normal minimum pension age, unless the ill-health condition was met immediately before the member became entitled to a pension under the scheme.

&gt;To become a QROPS, a pension scheme must apply to and be approved by HMRC. A list of QROPS that have consented to have their names published is available on the HMRC website and is regularly updated. 

&gt;In April and May 2012 HMRC introduced a new host of regulations that had the effect of shifting the jurisdictions in which QROPS could be established. Guernsey had previously been the premier jurisdiction for QROPS but due to a conflict in between local legislation and HMRC regulations over 300 schemes were de-listed, but rather than close them permanently this had the effect of migrating the schemes to Malta. Malta was at this time regarded as an attractive proposition for the industry. It currently has 59 DTA’s with other countries including EU member states. It has been proactive in the development of the QROPS market with the installation of local regulators to work with HMRC in order to ensure that all rules and procedures are adhered to.   Since the new regulations came into force QROPS were also closed in Cyprus and are now principally available in Malta,  the Isle of Man,  and Gibraltar. 

&gt;A QROPS should operate broadly in line with UK pension rules. A UK pension holder who has transferred their pension to a QROPS should be in a similar position as they would have been if the transfer had not taken place. What differentiates a QROPS from a UK held pension is that it must be recognised as a pension scheme under the country's legislation where it resides whilst still complying with the rules set out by HMRC. As the jurisdiction's rules, where the pension resides, differ to UK rules this leads to benefits available to the holder in comparison to a UK pension scheme. These benefits include having a greater choice of how much income can be drawn and the ability to avoid death taxes.  On returning to the UK a QROPS will be treated the same as any other UK pension scheme which may necessitate changes to the underlying holdings. A key requirement prior to returning to the UK is to ensure all investments held within the account are UK compliant. This may involve selling some or all of the current investment holdings. The policy can then be fully endorsed.

&gt;QROPS schemes are required to report to HMRC any payments made to the member for at least ten years from the date that the transfer took place. However if the pension holder has been non-UK resident for five complete tax years they can benefit from more attractive options than those allowed under UK pension schemes.

&gt;QROPS are increasingly popular with British Expats due to the tax advantages they offer on pension draw downs and their ability to be transferred to chosen beneficiaries in the event of the pension owner's death. Pension funds left in the UK are heavily taxed, in some cases up to 55%. Transferring a UK pension fund into a QROPS can avoid UK taxation.

That said, our immigration law seems to leave open the possibility of making a child stateless (if the country their parents are from does not accept foreign births as a sign of citizenship).

I mean if you look at the rules, you're almost turning a child into a reverse-exile, in that they can remain in the UK indefinitely as long as they don't leave and then try to re-enter without applying for such a right (or for citizenship)... and then what happens if they do leave and try to come back? No country is going to take them... is this not a strange infringement on a persons right to exist and their free movement?

The idea of citizenship itself just seems antiquated to me - a remnant of the world wars. These days there's a lot of people who can claim to be British and they possibly:

I absolutely agree that Skrtel is lucky to have kept getting chances over and over again, but him staying fit whilst Toure, Agger and Sakho have had injury problems has played it's part, in that sense he's reliable. He's also lucky to have escaped the critism/borderline abuse that Lovren is getting but that's what the lack of expectation and a £20m price tag will do. I read a lot that Skrtel isn't a leader and needs someone who is beside him, but he really should be trying to step up and take charge as he's the oldest (29), most experienced and well verse with the style of play in the back line.

Clearly some of the problem is the system as Skrtel and Johnson were both part of one of the best defences in the league (2011/12) and are now both part of one of the worst in the league. But what we've seen recently is Skrtel plays with Toure, and Toure becomes a clown to the point of ironic hero status. Skrtel plays with Sakho, and Sakho becomes a clumsy waste of £17m. Skrtel plays with Lovren, and Lovren becomes the ""worst defender I've ever seen in a Liverpool shirt"".

But the point of my post was that Neville and Carragher are just couple of retired footballers who like to talk about football. They have to find something interesting to talk about or else their jobs would not have a point. Sometimes they just sound convinceing and the material doesn't have to be exactly 100% true. Remember when they critizised Mignolet for letting in that wondergoal by Jagielka and then Schmeichel basically called it bollocks? People jumped on Mignolet even more in effort to try to find someone to blame for the lost 2 points. Some people blamed Rodgers for bringing on Lambert. I mean they were really seething. Carra and Neville just poured some fuel on the fire when critizising Mignolet although they hardly know how goalkeepers should stand.

The game will start with Liverpool playing like Barcelona, only for a Glen Johnson wonder goal to go in at the wrong end and silence the away support. Then, with Ludogrets in the lead and playing comfortably in our 6 yard box, they'll score a second from a set piece. Seeing a change is needed, Migs will be subbed for Lambert, who will play sweeper-keeper in a new attempt at securing 3 points by Rodgers. Lambert, after conceding 13 goals (all from indirect freekicks) before half-time, decides that he's better played up front and tells Borini to take his place between the sticks. Gerrard stays quiet on the issue, like any good captain, instead screaming to Borini to 'pass it to Skrtel and Toure more than Lambert did, and not toward the front'. 

After recieving the ball a record 70,523 times, Skrtl is tired of passing it to Gerrard and Tourse. He asks Gerrard and Brendao if he can perhaps run forward for once, or make a long pass. He is instantly subbed, and wonder kid Flanno miraculously returns from injury to take his place.

It's penalties galore for Liverpool, and though they've had 99% of the possession it's all been in their half. It's 15-15 with 5 minutes to go; Liverpools goals of course coming from misplaced passes and runs by Sterling through the defence. 

Gerrard is through on goal, the clock says 90+5, and the crowd is screaming and singing the chant we all know and love. Gerrard, racing toward goal, looks toward Brendao, who is screaming at him to lace it back to Skrtl, who has been sent back on to soley receive this pass. Knowing this to be the only way they can possibly score, Gerrard stops short of the 12 yard box and places a masterclass of a pass into the feet of Skrtl. Who, of course, attempts to pass to Toure. The move, having been completed nearly a million times in the last 95 minutes, is read by Ludogrets who now have only migs (Who has somehow come back on the pitch) to beat. 

The shot is poor, but instead of catching it like a normal person, Migs decides to punch it. Suprised faces all round as he punches it into his own net, even Toure is impressed. The whistle goes.

false,Translocase,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"Triage nurses follow a protocol. They prioritise patients and organise the order in which patients are seen in the queue. In general, almost all the thinking is done for the nurse. A nurse who is trained to follow the protocol is more than sufficient. I don't doubt that a good nurse would certainly ask for help outside the rules if they were unsure or if the problem was a serious emergency.

Same also applies to doctors and nurse practitioners; more than likely, they will be following a protocol for whatever problem you've come in with. Broken leg? Find the ""broken leg"" protocol, follow instructions. Not quite so simple, but that's the gist. Things don't get missed, every patient has the same experience. In theory. Not everything fits these instructions perfectly. 

Doctors also work in triage at certain times of the day. They can treat people there and then. Technically for our department, only a doctor (and nurse practitioners) could discharge and refer. 

Again, A&amp;E is not a good place for the vast majority of problems. It seems like a quick option, but really it will just be a waste of time for the majority of people. It will never really get to the bottom of that ""chest pain you've had for 15 years and you've decided to get checked out this morning"". It's job is to ask 1. Is this chest pain going to kill you? 2. Can we stop it? Take 2 of these, and goodbye. [obviously not to say that such chest pain is not important or a potential emergency, that's one of the difficulties] 

It is a highly focused and technical area. Medical emergencies (which is an enormous area of medicine, mind) and not much else.

false,vomausland,null,null,"I attended a TTIP conference in Berlin today with experts both for and against from the EU, unions and ministries. Here's my summary: 

- There are a ton of myths or inaccuracies going round. No wonder - a BIG problem that everyone agreed with is that there has been a terrible lack of public communication with what TTIP is along with the advantages and disadvantages. 

- The negotiations are in secret. However, the draft agreement will not be secret. Once that is in place, everyone can look at it and complain about it being unfair if they like. Either way, the USA will not publish their proposals until they have developed them. It means we (the public and our representatives) cannot yet react as we don't know what we're reacting to. One concern is that there will be a rush after the publication of the drafts to make a decision on the agreement before the US presidential election, otherwise negotiations will stall.

- Another big problem is trying to find concordance between all of the EU states. After all, this isn't a British agreement or a German agreement with America. Which standards do we keep for ourselves and which do we ""harmonise""? Some things in the EU aren't clearly defined. What constitutes ""culture"", for example, when we want to decide what is left in and what is left out of TTIP? There is no clear legal or political definition for this within the EU, so how can we even negotiate on it? An area which interests me is audiovisual media, which are specifically to be left out of TTIP (for now at least!)... but what will count as A/V and what will be branded as 'telecommunications'? Similarly, each state decides what counts as a 'public service', so it is difficult to have a single overview of the affect on the EU as a whole in this area.

- While the break up of some general-interest service provisions (public services) will mean more competitiveness and more jobs, it was argued that these jobs will be a race to the bottom in terms of pay and conditions. It was argued that, if a government chooses to privatise, say, the provision of electricity then it WOULD be difficult to back out... but it would be through normal means of a court case and compensation, just as any normal legal contract may require. 

- However, an (some?) adjudication board(s?) would be in charge of disputes within the TTIP zone. Should we give so much power over what we are allowed to do with our own country's resources up to one panel of a few people? It was argued that adjudication panels already operate between our countries on trade issues, across several industries all the time without any fuss being kicked up.

- Huge trade agreements are normal in our increasingly globalised world - just look at the partnerships in Asia, Pacific, Americas etc. If we want to keep to ourselves on an EU level, or worse, on a national level, we will lose some very profitable opportunities for growth creation. Essentially, the EU could be playing catchup and we will lose some of our bargaining power when it comes to intercontinental trade. It's our way of protecting ourselves for the future. 

- A lot of people would like to wait and see how CETA comes along (EU-Canada trade agreement) in order to provide a blueprint for TTIP. We shouldn't think of ""TTIP is great/evil"", but rather ""how can we use this opportunity to improve life and business in the EU?"". 

It all comes down to this: negotiations are always give and take. Is what we would get worth what we would have to give up?

Either way, we MUST inform ourselves. And the EU MUST provide us with more information in a clear, digestible format in order for us, as citizens of the European Union, to decide if we are for or against. 

Edit: To address the article - ""The report finds that... Canada has faced 35 claims worth billions of dollars as a result of cases being brought by US transnationals [as part of the NAFTA trade agreement]. It’s already lost over $175 million, but this could be the tip of the iceberg, as companies are suing Canada for such crimes as revoking drilling permits, subsidising renewable energy, placing a moratorium on fracking, questioning pharmaceutical patents, banning toxic additives in petrol and placing a temporary ban on the export of toxic waste.""

$175 million is nothing over the course of 20 years, considering the deal is worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Also, if your company suddenly had your drilling permit removed after you had invested millions upon the past approval or a drug you had developed was unreasonably banned, wouldn't you want to be able to sue the government to fight your case? ""Banning toxic additives in petrol"" is weasly phrasing - who is claiming they are toxic? With what proof and using good scientific methods? And shouldn't a company be able to claim money if you suddenly change your mind about a chemical? 

TTIP DOES NOT force the NHS to be privatised! It just requires the government to stick to its word to the companies it hands NHS services to. If the government changes its mind or goes back on a contract, then of course they will sue the government. This already happens. However, the court would be a TTIP adjudicator... this part IS controversial.",0,1417028961,null,0,1417029871,0,cmdsenm,t3_2nhl2w,t1_cmdsenm,t3_2nhl2w,null,1425828339,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23

The number after each was your overall mark for the module, but when you get the degree the mark is removed and you just see A,B,C etc.

But this is just further proof that it varies by uni and you need to ask whatever particular uni you end up at. Final grades are still the same though you will always (at least on a BSc or BA) end up with a first class honours, upper second(2:1), lower second(2:2),a third or a fail.
