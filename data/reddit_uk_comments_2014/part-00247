I wasn't a fan of the titles. I like my time vortex to be spacey, not clock-y. Eh, doesn't really matter that much.

I thought that Peter Capaldi did an excellent job as the Doctor and I thought that his relationship with Clara was brilliantly well done (especially the bits in the restaurant).

I also figured out it was the clockwork droids about halfway through the episode, much to my friend's annoyance. It might have been because I happened to be watching ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" last night.

I was very shocked when the dinosaur combusted and when the skin hot air balloon lifted off. Pretty sickening.

Something tells me that the whole thing with the Doctor's face is going to be more important than I thought. Maybe they will go back to Pompeii?

But if you think of all the legitimate arrests and good work that the police do every day (this just being a noticeable example), the balance is clearly on the good side.

Police officers are only human. While that's not enough to excuse everything, it's unrealistic to expect the police to never make any mistakes whatsoever. Institutional failures should be rooted out and put on display and individually responsible officers should be appropriately punished, but in general it's just juvenile to denounce every single police officer in the country because of a few/statistically tiny proportion of wrongdoing.

The great thing though is that one day you will get a new showrunner and once again the show will regenerate with a new face and personality.

Personally, I loved the 11th's first two and a half seasons- so, the Amy Pond Arc.  The Eleventh Hour was such a strong start, and is one of my favorite episodes.  I work in the film industry and the major increase in production values and cinematography in the Moffat era were a big plus for me.  I get the charm of Doctor Who looking cheap (I loved watching all of the 4th Doctor), but the new style lends to more immersion in the story, world, and characters.

 Now, was it perfect? No. Was there something magical and beautiful about it? Definitely!  Just look at all the new fans it brought.
 
I think the 7th season is probably my least favorite of the renewed series, because I agree that the writing for the 11th was becoming a bit too much of a caricature and not a subtle well rounded character- a little like late Tom Baker.  Also, Clara, as much as I love her performance, isn't the most interesting or well written characters.  
Anyway, those are my thoughts.  Despite all his flaws, I'm a huge Moffat fan. ",0,1408829418,null,0,false,0,cjym0ko,t3_2ed8sa,t1_cjym0ko,t3_2ed8sa,null,1427390658,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Not really, we can't take much away from regeneration episodes about their overall character. Besides, useless? Got on the right track, noticed shit Clara somehow missed, saved Clara, saved the day and managed to convince her to keep travelling. Not bad for someone still suffering from post regeneration sickness. 

&gt;In addition to that, the plot didn't make any sense whatsoever, like what was a fucking dinosaur doing there, got exploded and noone gave a shit. The robots were just ridiculously bad and didn't really do anything the entire episode.

The Dinosaur got transported by the TARDIS, much like Jack did in Utopia. No one gave a shit? Did you miss the entire part where everyone was gathered there to witness it? 

The robots are the clockwork droids, not sure why you expected them to suddenly be better than they were the first time around? And given that they've had to survive for millions of years, obviously they wouldn't do much, they needed to conserve as much power and parts as possible. 

&gt;And the end, what the fuck was that even, it wasn't really adding anything except a ""What... are you.. what is happening right now"" moment, which really doesn't add anything.

Ugh, isn't it very clear that it's part of a multi episode storyline? Not to mention it will answer a bunch of questions. I can't see how you can say it doesn't add anything.

&gt;

&gt;The __ship of Theseus__, also known as __Theseus' paradox__, is a [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment) that raises the question of whether an object which has had all its components replaced remains fundamentally [the same object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy\)). The paradox is most notably recorded by [Plutarch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch) in *[Life of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_Lives)* from the late 1st century. Plutarch asked whether a ship which was restored by replacing each and every one of its wooden parts remained the same ship.

&gt;The paradox had been discussed by more ancient philosophers such as [Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus), [Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates), and [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato) prior to Plutarch's writings; and more recently by [Thomas Hobbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes) and [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke). There are several variants, notably ""grandfather's axe"". This thought experiment is ""a model for the philosophers""; some say, ""it remained the same,"" some saying, ""it did not remain the same"".

2 - His writing has always felt off to pretty much everyone. He has a great imagination but can't convey it well (enough for a sci-fi series).

3&amp;4 - agreed.

5 - Doctor who is, and always has been, tacky at heart. Its part of the wonder of it. People should not expect a glossy, streamlined show just cos the episodes are newer.

6 - The intro is awesome. So much better than the instagram'd pile of crap we had last series (anyone else feel like they needed sunglasses?)

The rest - Capaldi is awesome, Moffat can't write but he's here to stay until next series at least. And finally... Smiths regen episode was nothing short of terrible. This blew his out of the water. Tennant's is still my favourite, though.

true,Jarrrp,tardis,TARDIS,"Well I really, really enjoyed it! Doctor Who seems to turn everyone into a critic but as a massive fan of the show, I loved it...because it's DOCTOR WHO.

Firstly, the whole thing felt entirely new and different. Not just because of the gorgeous new title sequence (which I LOVE) but because the show is very clearly in a new direction. The scenes are longer, there's more drama...the whole production quality seems really renewed.

Capaldi's Doctor is GREAT! I'm sure he'll get further chances to show himself off later in the series but I think we got a good introduction to him. He did a great job at confusing everyone with his post-regeneration lunatic performance and really came into his own when he'd finally calmed down and realised who he was. The moment when he tells Clara she was too slow and couldn't have his sonic screwdriver was just so clever and it shows that 12 is really going to be unreliable.

The scene where Clara has to hold her breath is truly terrifying. I felt sick just watching it. Because anybody who has tried to hold their breath knows that it feels horrible and you felt what Clara was going through. The half-face man was terrifying and the CGI complimented the character really well.

Nice mention of Amy and a few other throwbacks including ""Sister ship of the Madame De Pompadour,"" which explained exactly who the clockwork droids were and where we'd seen them before! I think every Whovian in the room knew what the Doctor meant when he said he'd seen all of this before. It was easy to remember back to the way the clockwork droids were trying to rebuild their ship using human flesh and the Madame was the final piece! It all made sense!

Seeing Smith's Doctor again was heart breaking and a really touching scene. It was a very lovely goodbye for 11 and was necessary in reassuring Clara that the man she was speaking to really was him! I'd heard from filming that Clara has a phone call with 11 and I had a feeling Smith had probably filmed a scene for it during filming for Time of the Doctor. It must have been great for Smith to have known his Doctor wasn't quite done yet even though he'd regenerated (never mind the fact Smith is already bursting to make a cameo return!).

I'm going to give it another watch tomorrow, as I always do, the second time is always better as you stop concentrating on the story and more on the elements you might have missed.

Overall I'm really thrilled with Capaldi's Doctor and I think we're in for a really great ride!

* Amy and Rory offered a great new dynamic. It was nice to have a couple in a functional relationship without the girl swooning over the Doctor (ok, she did in the first few episodes, but that was part of her character arc during Series 5, when she realized Rory was her dude). And Rory turned into quite the badass. As for River Song, I get the criticism. The River that could have been when we watched Silence in the Library was always better than the River that actually was.

* It's far from watertight writing, specially during Series 6, which is just a mess (and most of the faults in Time of the Doctor are due to trying to fix that crap up). But Series 5 is *freaking amazing*, and a very welcome change of pace from RTD's finales. Yes RTD was great with subtle story arcs, but his subtle arcs were getting very repetitive - subtle hints throughout episodes and finales that raised the stakes every time. 

* Doctor Who should be about moving forward! Nods to the past are always welcome, but they should never hang on to classic villains only. It's about moving forward. The Doctor has access to all of time and space, it should never feel like he's meeting only the same handful of enemies (and he already encounters the Daleks too damn much).

* The Doctor romantic barrier had already been broken with Rose. If anything the problem with the Doctor's marriage is not in itself, but the fact that it doesn't feel earned (I'm not a huge fan of River Song myself). And I don't see your problem with the Doctor's name. It was just hints to the story arc of the season that culminated in Time of the Doctor.

All in all, Moffat did a lot more good than harm. His writing is far from perfect and that is made most obvious in Series 6, but RTD's Who *was* getting a bit repetitive. The feel of the show changed a lot and there's no way to deny that it *worked*.

negatives:

* dinosaur was completely wasted, not a big deal at all
* doctor's confusion lasted a little too long
* bad guys felt more clumsy than threatening
* Clara bluffing the main bad robot guy in a silly way, he stopped being threatening altogether
* the doctor talked him to death (?) off-screen, still don't get why. Just seemed pretty rushed.
* another goodbye with Matt Smith, when the last one was much, much better

positives:

* Strax
* doctor finding out he's Scottish
* the restaurant scene, very creepy
* doctor's quite dark
* intro, Tardis' new look

I stopped watching after David Tennant left as it got boring and lost its darker feel, and I thought that it might get better with a new Doctor played by the same actor who played Malcom Tucker in The Thick of It.

Although the show is still tonally all over the place and feels like it's written by eccied up hamsters. Other thoughts:

* Lesbian kiss was total fan service, although nice to see on British tv that it's no longer controversial to show a same-sex kiss. So fair enough maybe?
* Entire scene with them mucking about with the restraints and screwdriver was wasted time - we know they'll get out of the bind.
* While shot well, the Clara holding her breath thing was a bit over-wrought. Although it did set up the later predicament for the others.
* *Massive* brownie points for Michelle Gomez, she's delightfully wild in everything and I'm sure she'll bring a lot to the show.
* There was very little timey-wimey nonsense and ass-pulling regarding the plot, so that's nice.
* Ultimately, the villain just wasn't that interesting to me. Sure, he's meant to be a foil for the Doctor with the always changing shtick, but he was pretty devoid of any interesting characteristics - they even resorted to the ""Promised Land"" cliche to try and force some weak motivation into his plans.
* New Tardis looks pretty ace.
* Victorian London bores the pants off of me. Take me somewhere interesting, even if it is 12's first foray.
* As noted elsewhere, Clara got some nice characterisation here and the acting in the interrogation scene was superb, even allowing the hideously shmaltzy conclusion.
* 22 years after Jurassic Park and that dinosaur looked like it was from something 22 years before Jurassic Park, it was horrible.

true,Jarrrp,tardis,TARDIS,"Well I really, really enjoyed it! Doctor Who seems to turn everyone into a critic but as a massive fan of the show, I loved it...because it's DOCTOR WHO.

Firstly, the whole thing felt entirely new and different. Not just because of the gorgeous new title sequence (which I LOVE) but because the show is very clearly in a new direction. The scenes are longer, there's more drama...the whole production quality seems really renewed.

Capaldi's Doctor is GREAT! I'm sure he'll get further chances to show himself off later in the series but I think we got a good introduction to him. He did a great job at confusing everyone with his post-regeneration lunatic performance and really came into his own when he'd finally calmed down and realised who he was. The moment when he tells Clara she was too slow and couldn't have his sonic screwdriver was just so clever and it shows that 12 is really going to be unreliable.

The scene where Clara has to hold her breath is truly terrifying. I felt sick just watching it. Because anybody who has tried to hold their breath knows that it feels horrible and you felt what Clara was going through. The half-face man was terrifying and the CGI complimented the character really well.

Nice mention of Amy and a few other throwbacks including ""Sister ship of the Madame De Pompadour,"" which explained exactly who the clockwork droids were and where we'd seen them before! I think every Whovian in the room knew what the Doctor meant when he said he'd seen all of this before. It was easy to remember back to the way the clockwork droids were trying to rebuild their ship using human flesh and the Madame was the final piece! It all made sense!

Seeing Smith's Doctor again was heart breaking and a really touching scene. It was a very lovely goodbye for 11 and was necessary in reassuring Clara that the man she was speaking to really was him! I'd heard from filming that Clara has a phone call with 11 and I had a feeling Smith had probably filmed a scene for it during filming for Time of the Doctor. It must have been great for Smith to have known his Doctor wasn't quite done yet even though he'd regenerated (never mind the fact Smith is already bursting to make a cameo return!).

I'm going to give it another watch tomorrow, as I always do, the second time is always better as you stop concentrating on the story and more on the elements you might have missed.

Overall I'm really thrilled with Capaldi's Doctor and I think we're in for a really great ride!

Ps. It's great to see Capaldi take over the sub-Reddit now! Welcome to the Capaldi Snoo!",0,1408830818,null,0,false,0,cjymk9d,t3_2ee4u1,t1_cjymk9d,t3_2ee4u1,null,1427390403,44,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,44

But that's not what this is about. This was about people defending Moffat's (pretty shabby) writing for Deep Breath by referencing RTDs first couple of episodes. 

A more fair comparison would be Deep Breath vs Christmas Invasion (Regeneration) or Deep Breath vs Partners In Crime (Fourth series vs Fourth series) which both IMO had better writing.

Like Vastra demonstrated, I think he's finally lifted the vail. I think the best word to describe the feeling I have is, mystery, I don't know who The Doctor is anymore. 

Doctor WHO? That's the point, and I think this is what Moffat and Peter are trying to do. Sure the T-Rex was awful, but the younger audience aren't bothered about what we think, Moffat has to please a huge audience now, its a hole he dug himself into and we just have to put up with it for now.  

I think further into the series we will leave the fantasy style scripts we had with Matt Smith behind and hopefully, Moffat will add more emphasis on time-travel.

Against Leicester, he brought on Mirallas for Pienaar who was having a superb game rather than McGeady who was starting to dwindle giving the ball away. Mirallas on that side then ended up giving the ball away which resulted in the goal.

Again today, it was clear both CB was getting tired, as was Barry and Osman. Instead of taking off Osman who you could tell had no legs, he took of Mirallas which resulted in McGeady being moved to the other side and it was him not tracking back that gave Ramsey the time and space to put in the ball that resulted in the second goal.

I'd argue he set fire to the dinosaur at the right time. Anything else and it would either over complicated the story taking away from the main plot and character stuff, so he killed it and linked the killing into the main plot instead. Makes sense. 

And I believe nobody panicking is something to do with how Victorian England and particularly London is generally portrayed and how it may very well have been; very very weird. 

Have you heard about that Rasputin fellow? And that whole thing only got WEIRDER in the 20th century. 

That whole portrayal of the Victorian times might be arguable as overly nostalgic, but at least they've kept it consistent within the fictional universe of the show. Remember the giant steampunk cyberman? 

Reuse of clockwork robot is a flaw, I'll give you that one. They kept referencing that it'd already happened which means I'll let them off a little bit but it wasn't a plot point so they're still on the hook for that. I kind of feel like I have to rewatch it because they might have said that the two ships were linked somehow.

Regardless, they did the concept differently at least, and I'd argue that really the episode wasn't really about that, it was more of a backdrop, so didn't necessarily have to be original.

I don't really want to recount all the character stuff to you, just watch the episode again, like half the run time was devoted to it so I bet if you really try then you'll catch at least a bit of it.

And I love Matt Smith too. I was completely on board with him reappearing and am completely up for him reappearing any time in the future.

Cissokho was very good until he went off in both defence and attack, put in some decent crosses but nobody could get on the end of them.


Sanchez Cameo - Not that much to say, 1 great pass, otherwise not involved much. Looks like he will need a bit of time to get up to speed as he took up the wrong position a few times but put himself about well enough.


Mike Dean - poor, loads of soft fouls that he should have let go completely fragmented the game.


Guessing Hodgson was only at Villa Park because he could get there for the early kick off.

true,Greaseball01,pertwee,Pertwee,"I wouldn't say he undid anything. First of all, can we deal with the fact that the time war has NEVER made any sense?

How could a war that happened at some point mean that the Doctor would never run into anymore time lords? 

They have all of time and space. Just because the planet and presumably a very large amount of time lords get killed at one point in time does not mean that all the others, whizzing around in the fourth dimension are dead. Time lords from Gallifreys (literally) entire history should still be popping up at thousands if not millions of points in time. And yet the Doctor never meets any of them. And somehow everybody knows that the time lords are dead when really death has no meaning to a time traveller. A dead person has always at some point been alive, therefore they are never dead to a wanderer in the fourth dimension. 

So when Moffat finally retconned the whole retarded mess with something that made at least a little more sense I was overjoyed. To be honest I thought RTD was going to retcon it with his last episode. I don't know why he didn't, because it made no fucking sense.

But yes, it did help with some character development, but Moffat didn't undo any of that. It was all real until the moment 11 decided to change it. At some point the Doctor really did destroy Gallifrey. Kill all those people and have to deal with what that meant for him and what that did to him. Moffat didn't erase any of that. It all still happened and all still continued to effect the character. 

What he did was use that event, which had a huge impact on that characters growth to grow him even further. The whole point of 11 as a character was that he believed he could get out of any situation. That regardless of what he faced he'd always think of something that would get him out on top. Then he gets to Trenzalore, and it's a no win scenario.

Of course he does win in the end, but he loses his youth, then he loses his mind, then he thinks he might have lost Clara. That last bit being pretty much what the characters were dealing with in this episode, with some issues of identity, and perception thrown in with a healthy dose of fan service.

Also, and I don't mean to be coarse or aggressive here, but if you think Christmas Invasion was better written than this then you're a fucking idiot.

I'd elaborate, but it would only mean my sweariness would lose weight.

true,quantumpenguins,tennant,Tennant,"The episode was by no means perfect, in my opinion, but nevertheless thoroughly enjoyable. 

My main issues were these:

-Overstating Jenny and Vestra's relationship ([u/JimmyImpersonator](http://www.reddit.com/user/JimmyImpersonator) sums it up pretty well in their response in my opinion). Whilst I love their relationship, this episode really shoves it down viewers' throats. The kiss would have been fine without the oxygen crap.

-The dinosaur. A huge reptile is hanging around the River Thames and all it gets is a couple of Victorians with a ""well would you look at that"" look on their faces. Surely it would have at least become a big historical event?

-The new intro music. Meh (purely personal though. And I love the new graphics, so there's that)

-The ""don't breathe"" thing. It was like dragging out ""Blink"" all over again ^oh ^please ^let ^it ^just ^stop.


However, some things I absolutely adore:

-Strax. I just can't get over that human-sized potato pumped full of testosterone.

-Clara. She's annoyed me in the past with being just a little too ""perfect"" and without enough character - it was good to see her getting fleshed out for once.

-Capaldi. I love him, especially in the wake of Matt Smith who has always bugged me (Series 7 wasn't exactly my favourite run as you can imagine.) Plus, I like the slightly darker version we have here - did he push, or didn't he?

-The one liners. ""I'm Scottish! I can complain about things!""

-The scene between the Doctor and Clara at the end, after the phone call. The Doctor is desperately trying to make that connection between 
Number Eleven and himself for Clara, and is obviously trying to overcome both their hurt. Also, his recurring evaluation of his constant regeneration - the broom handle, for instance, was a wonderful bit of writing. 

-The questions. Ooph I love the loose ends here. Did he push the cyborg? Who is the cyborg? What is the promised land? Who is Missy? Will Madame du Pompadour be back? Will the Doctor realise where his face came from? 

I have heard some excellent theories about Missy. (Or Miss Pickwell, as some may know her as.) From her being the Master, to River Song or even an aged Clara. I love the idea that ""Paradise"" is the computer programme River Song found herself in at the end of The Library. Maybe she squeezed out another generation? Also, anyone remember the suspicious scene at the end of ""The Last Of The Time Lords"" when the Master's ring was picked up by a hand with heavily painted nails? My parents' prevailing theory is that he somehow regenerated as a woman.

Either way, bring on episode 2!",0,1408832904,null,0,1408833304,0,cjyneh3,t3_2ee4u1,t1_cjyneh3,t3_2ee4u1,null,1427390012,146,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,146

Yes, some of the dialogue was awful, particularly the lines about lesbian sex and how old the Doctor is. But some of it was some character building for Clara and especially the Doctor. Don't give me this ""But that was only 15 mins of the episode"" crap. Tumblr reaction gifs? Please.

Got boring after David Tennant and lost its ""darker feel""? Are you shitting me? In what universe is David Tennant's era dark? Look at Love and Monsters, New Earth, Tooth and Claw, The Shakespeare Code, Gridlock, the crap Daleks in Manhattan two parter, Voyage of the Damned, Partners in Crime, The Doctor's Daughter, The Unicorn and the Wasp, The Next Doctor... Not dark. 

You obviously never watched any Matt Smith episodes either. They were pretty dark, particularly the Sixth Series. This episode was a good balance: not perfect, but good.

Could the woman at the end of the episode be the Rani?  That was my immediate guess. Here's my reasoning:

1. That Tyrannosaur. The episode began with a T-rex in the middle of Victorian England. The Rani had done many experiments on dinosaurs and had previously collected T-Rex embryos, one of which accidentally aged from time spillage from the Tardis.

2. She's a mad scientist type. Exactly the type of person to go all Frankenstein on a Clockwork Droid. The droids themselves would be fascinating to her.

3. She claims to have an intimate relationship with the doctor. The Rani pretty much grew up with him.

4. When we last left the Rani, she wasn't killed off and wasn't on Gallifrey. As of Classic Who, there was no indication that she wasn't alive.

This episode was dark, and it doesn't help with some of the more childish aspects (Hold your breath, they can't see you!) not gelling with the darker themes. Oh, and the Doctor can harass old homeless people now.

Not to say that it was bad. As a horror story, it is fairly good, if not without flaws (why would a machine that uses humans as spare parts not just take the whole body? why burn it? and for that matter, how did they burn the CGI-nosaur the way it did?) and definitely had a decent creepy setting. It was funny too, a Scottish Doctor blaming the English, 
""Today's times, would you like it sent up to you?"" ""yes"" *BOOM HEADSHOT*, the various continuity nods and the spats between Clara and the Doctor.

TL:DR Good episode, but man was it darker than normal, especially considering young kids watch this show

true,kierdoyle,null,null,"My thoughts on the match:
2-0, I'll take it. Second half looked good.

Courtois was very very good, saves like the 1v1 he made are match turners. That goes in, or the 2v1, and Leicester park it and we don't win. Distribution much improved from the horror show that was Burnley, cross taking exceptional, very good.

JT and Gaz looked solid again, both looked caught for pace in behind a few times but good interceptions, nothing major to worry about but midfield can't let the passes in behind happen.

Brana was phenomenal again, 2 newly promoted sides yes, but very very very good going forward, much improved from last season. Last year on the cut back for Costa's goal, he would've welly'd it into the side netting, much more composed and intelligent on the ball. Dave looked solid defensively, a little bit exposed due to Hazard being a tad lazier defensively today, but looked decent. Still think his lack of a natural left foot harms him going up the line, but well done. Feel bad for Luis trying to get a game.
 
Matic was exceptional as per usual, breaking things up, needs to pick up the tempo of his game a little though. Cesc was here and there. Not as good as Burnley, but he creates things. Tries to be too cute, ie chip on Schmeichel, but it comes with the territory I guess.

Hazard looked phenomenal going forward, he created 7 chances or something ludicrous like that, but he was suspect defensively. Can get away with it here, but not against the better teams.

Oscar looked much better than last week, think Mourinho's had a word with him. That being said, Willian looked very driven, hungry, and motivated off the bench. That will push Oscar and I look forward to it.
Can't say I noticed much of Schurrle if I'm honest.

Costa looked good again, interplay is solid, movement good. He scores the scrubbiest, cuntiest, shittiest goals of all time, but the point is he scores them. Delighted. Drogba I was so happy to see him return, however IMO I think Torres may be a better second option. At least for now. Didier looked a yard off the pace back in 2012, and he looks a yard off the pace he was then now. Will be a good impact sub when we need to smash balls against a packed 18, but for work rate, pressing, and a starting striker due to injury/suspension, I would go with Fernando.

Fabianski had a good game, can't remember too many saves he had to make but he was constantly claiming crosses. They had the possession and they created some pressure, but they weren't *dangerous* with it, I agree with you there. 

Also thought the Amat-Ashley pairing was good again, I'm a fan of Jordi and I'm glad he's started showing off the 'defender' bit of his 'ball-playing defender' tag a little bit more. The whole back-5 was pretty solid - this is where coaching and drilling arguably come into it the most, when we're not at our best, most fluent or most fit. I think we all pointed out a couple times last season that the defensive organisation of the team wasn't as good as we'd have hoped form a team being coached by a central defender, but that organisation has been one of the most noticeable parts of our football in these last 2 games, so Garry's gotten things in  order.

All the talk was about Chelsea playing without a real striker. If Schurrle is a striker then so is Sterling and Ibe, even Coutinho for that matter, he played false 9 during the preseason.

Sanchez is an inside forward while playing out wide, but he is not a striker. Him playing the striker position didn't work, and it's no surprise. Besides, Sanogo is an unproven youth player. He played 8 games last season scoring a total of 0 goals in the League. He also played a total of 6 games in different cups adding another 0 goals. I will however concede that Walcott and Podolski probably could fit the bill leaving Arsenal at 3 proven strikers and one youth, much like the case of Liverpool.

City have 5 strikers, that is counting Negredo and Guidetti who they look to offload.

United is the only fair example, having 8 strikers in their squad, counting 3 unproven youth and Wilfred Zaha. Zaha is promising but during the last 2 years when he's been on loan to Crystal Palace and Cardiff, he has scored once in 26 appearances.

So Liverpool actually have more strikers that Arsenal and Chelsea (Balo, Sturridge, Lambert and Borini who we are looking to sell + Origi coming in next season) If we by some strange string of events find ourselves without all of our 3 senior strikers we have the youth to rely on.

Edit: Forgot about Podolski playing the striker role at Köln, although a few years ago.",0,1408837198,null,0,1408837546,0,cjyp2oi,t3_2edjcf,t1_cjyp2oi,t1_cjygjuu,null,1427389232,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,Chucklebuck,mcgann,McGann,"I've been trying to put my finger on why I didn't think this was a particularly good intro episode for Capaldi and after a few hours mulling it over, I've come to the conclusion that it was a weak introduction to his interpretation of The Doctor.

9 arrived on the scene by saving Rose from the Autons and blowing up a building. 10 spent a lot of time in bed, but once he'd recovered, he got up and kicked some arse. 11 almost literally exploded onto the scene with a brand new TARDIS and made the badass boast to the Atraxi that cemented his new character in one fell, awesome swoop.

With Capaldi, it's a strange beginning. He comes out talking a lot of nonsense, misremembering his friends and talking a lot of nonsense. 
Yes, The Doctor is prone to this, but not to these levels. I also couldn't get my head around why he decided to just completely ditch his friends and jump in the river and I can't fathom why he became a hobo for a few days. Has The Doctor's latest regeneration been so intense it's made him mentally ill? It seemed like his brain has been scrambled and by episode's end, I'm not sure that he's actually all completely there.

9 finished his premiere as a cocksure, confident space traveller willing to show Rose the ends of the universe. 10 shows himself as an intelligent trickster using unorthodox methods to save the day. 11 Was a total badass, showing how much of a threat to the evils of the universe he was.

12 seems like a forgetful old man with worrying tendencies that wants his best pal to accept him for who he is. I'm hoping they'll improve his character with further stories, but as it stands, it's a pretty weak introduction for what is arguably the most important episode for every new Doctor. People on Twitter are saying that Capaldi is a bad choice for The Doctor, but he's not: it's just a bad choice of introductory story.

All in all, the full episode was alright. It could have done with perhaps a more focused and original plotline - The Doctor in this episode even mentions that it's similar to previous adventures - and the extended scene in the alien ship felt off and like it doesn't belong in the kind of show Doctor Who is.

What was going on with the Byram red? It looked like he pushed his face into the Watford players and if the linesman has given it then fair play, I'd need to see another replay.

I'm just disappointed with our general set up and poor performances. Hock is clearly on his way and I don't mind, did anyone expect him to stay that long anyway? Cellino likes to look abroad for players so we might see him look to Serie B for a manager. Or, based on the decision to give the Hock a job, maybe lower down the pyramid than that...

We have the players to play 3/5 at the back so I wouldn't mind us trying out a tight counter attacking formation, we clearly aren't good enough to keep the ball and play through midfield with our current squad, so I'd like to see Matt Smith next to Sharp in a 5-3-2. He's a good outlet ball, and Sharp can play off him. But, with Byram being suspended it's going to tough down that right hand side. 

Disappointing performance overall but we have to keep moving forward and hope the side settles in a little bit and start working on our Home form as a matter of priority.

true,reductios,null,null,"The link seems to be a loyal defence of a friend’s book. He doesn't deny it’s a middlebrow work and only says that he tackles the standard arguments. However, saying he tackles the standard arguments competently doesn't mean that he thinks Dawkins is a deep thinker. As he also says the standard arguments have already been exhaustively eviscerated by scholars and so all Dawkins is doing is making the atheist arguments that have made thousands of time before. He doesn't even do that at a rigorous academic level but just produces a “consciousness-raiser aimed at the general religious public”.

He excuses Dawkins for not tackling the more sophisticated arguments by saying that he's looked at them and doesn't consider them worth wasting time on. I agree there is nothing really wrong with not tackling them. You can’t do everything in one book. I think the problem is that Dawkins comes across as being unaware of the sophisticated arguments (probably because he is unaware). So he often gives an unequivocal argument addressing the issue at a very simple level which gets the back up of anyone has a more sophisticated way of looking it.

I would have had no problem with him not talking about strong agnosticism either. The thing that I found irritating was that he did talk about it at length and dismissed it, but all he said was he has no idea why people believe it rather than finding out the arguments people have for holding the view and explaining why they are wrong.

Unpopular opinion time: 

I wish they wouldn't try to connect the Doctor's new face with the Fires of Pompeii.

They were played by the same actor, yes. It was a coincidence. I think we're all mature enough to suspend our disbelief on that front. Karen Gillan didn't need an excuse for her presence in that episode, and I feel like any explanation they pull out of their asses to satisfy the fans will just be really forced. The character obviously wasn't written to support that, so I'd hate to see them scrabble for some remarkable feature of Caecilius that the Doctor admired and sought to emulate.

true,Taltyelemna,tardis,TARDIS,"Okay, what the fuck did I just watch ? Oh, right, Moffat being Moffat.

Pros : Clara finally behaved like a human being instead of an over cooked noodle, Capaldi shows some real promise (but the 1st episode of a Doctor is rarely their best and doesn't really show how they will be throughout their lease on the character, but he's a great actor). New TARDIS interior is great. Good to address the face, too.

Cons : Why bring in a perfectly good stand-alone episode (Girl in the Fireplace) ? Oh, right, that's Moffat here showing us he can build a crazy plot arc that spans over several seasons. Also, the Doctor doesn't frigging kill, his pushing/talking the cyborg to death was way too much. This is not like the guy who tried to help Daleks in Manhattan ! Not like the guy who helped a Slitheen (okay, the farting jokes were awful, not going back on that one) get a new life ! Not like the guy who tried to give a chance to the Sycorax ! That's not darker, that's another character entirely.

Oh, also, what a lack of subtlety concerning Jenny and Vastra. He could only have been more insistant on their lesbianess if he had decided to go into lizard porn. Come on, you wouldn't rub in the heterosexuality of a male/female couple for what felt half the screen time of the characters. That's just rude, that's just boasting about ""oh look I'm open-minded I put gay characters in my show, look I'm amazing."" Just fucking treat them like any other characters !

Another lack of subtlety was the broom part. We would have understood the innuendo just as well without the over-abundant visual cues that ""OMG he's talking about himself, look, you even see his reflection in the mirror !!1!!""

Also, if Moffat could leave his dinosaur fetish in his bedroom, I'd be thankful. 

Also, could the Bad Wolf, or River, have anything to do with the strange woman in ""Paradise"" ?

Also, I'll keep watching, even though it's painful.

Also, BRB, I'm gonna binge on seasons 3 and 4.

PIA is my preferred option ([affiliate plug](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/PODERR) or [non-affiliate](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com), same price) because they're dirt cheap and have US and Canada servers (and others). 

I was using it earlier (with the US Midwest location) as Netflix US has Doctor Who S07, whereas the UK only goes up to S06. Canada also occasionally has stuff the others don't.

At the risk of sounding like I'm spreading FUD, think about [how Hola works](http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/1qnphj/psa_if_youre_uncomfortable_running_a_tor_exit/) and if you wish to be an endpoint for someone else's internet traffic. I would NOT run Hola on my network. I'd sooner be a TOR Endpoint.

If you don't fancy PIA, /r/vpn will happily recommend others. I tried EarthVPN recently and then signed back up to PIA. Mullvad was great, but the server selection wasn't. HMA is slick but expensive. I've affiliate links for a couple of other providers, but I make very little from any of them, so it doesn't sway my opinion.

You don't even have to trust PIA's software (although I do), you can use plain OpenVPN or PPTP. Using a good VPN provider that you pay for, even if it's cheaper than a Starbucks coffee a month, means you're the customer and not the product.

You get a couple of concurrent connections with PIA, and you can run their software directly on Android devices, or set it up on routers etc. If you download via Torrent (Linux ISO's, obviously) there are a set of servers that allow port forwarding which can make torrenting a shitload faster.

I hate being told I should or shouldn't like things by the creator/writer, whether it be outside or inside of the show. I'm a human being with a brain, let me make that decision for myself.  Let the character prove themselves to me and stop with the petty one-sided dialogue within the episode, it's annoying.

The rest of the episode was a mixed bag; hit character beats felt amazing and missed ones were cringeworthy. Some lines were awesome and others just fell flat on their face through the time vortex. The acting was so so so so so spotty at the beginning, like it felt like it was Peter Capaldi in the Whoniverse, not the doctor. 

I think that Clara was very OOC, and even the actor chemistry was for want of a better word, lacking. Even at the end when she got over herself, the CR felt constipated and unnatural.

You've got the Swedish/Danish ""The Bridge"", the superb French series ""Spiral"". ""The Killing"", original and remake.

You've got ""Firefly"" and ""SG-1"", ""8 out of 10 cats"" and ""QI"". ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" and ""Adventure Time"". ""Secret State"" and ""Utopia"". ""Black Mirror"".

That's not even scratching the surface. The Netflix commissions have been mostly epic. ""Orange is the New Black"", ""House of Cards""? Tell me those weren't brilliant. I've just started watching ""BoJack Horseman"" and it's bloody cracking.

It's different to the other Netflix catalogues, and I do find myself using the US and Canadian catalogues occasionally (like for Dr Who S07) but what we have is superb.

One thing that really pisses me off though, is sometimes the stuff doesn't have fucking subtitles.

* The discarding of the subplot(?) of the Doctor and Clara having some sort of feelings for one another was extremely sloppy. There needed to be a naturalistic way of doing it since it effectively encompassed the entirety of Clara's run so far.

* Matt Smith went out like a God of Television. The fact that we saw him again severely cheapened his final appearance and thoughts that were utter perfection in screenwriting.

* Who the hell was that woman at the end? 

* Clara talking down the lead clockwork robot sucked all of the tension out of the moment and wrecked the scariness of that villain.

At the time when Rodgers said Balotelli wasn't joining us, Milan were still quoting ~30m, and we were hoping to bring in one of the aforementioned other preferred options.

You can also use www.moreflicks.com and http://netflixaroundtheworld.com to find out what's on in which region.

Oh, and for anyone who wants to use Hola - I'd recommend using it on a different browser than your usual, or just disabling except for using Netflix.

That said, if you look at the teams we were fielding in the CL the year before, Redknapp was doing pretty fucking well IMO. 

The away leg of the tie against AC Milan almost seems like a dream now, but it did happen and this is how we lined up against them:

Gomes; Corluka, Dawson, Gallas, BAE; Sandro, Palacios; Lennon, VDV, Pienaar; Crouch

Or how about the 09/10 side in the deciding match for CL qualification:

Gomes; Kaboul, Dawson, King, BAE; Lennon, Huddlestone, Modric, Bale; Crouch, Defoe

I really don't think he had a stacked starting 11 until 2011/2012 when we had Bale and Modric near the height of their powers and a motivated Adebayor (not to mention VDV). ",0,1408848758,null,0,false,0,cjytowa,t3_2ee996,t1_cjytowa,t1_cjyqyke,null,1427387006,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

We had a very strong team last year that only really needed a striker who could finish and another creative midfielder who could breakdown defensive-minded sides. We have that in Costa and Fabregas. Yes, I will agree we do not have a great backup for Costa, but that really is the only problem with the squad right now. As for Terry, I want him playing until he shows he can't handle it.

Pros:  
-Capaldi really worked as the doctor and genuinely had me interested where they would take his character.  
-Villain was creepy and worked really well as the first villain a new doctor has to face with all the regeneration metaphors.  
-Clara's character was interesting and was not used as fan service.  
-Clara and Madame Vastra's conversation about veil's and the doctor's age was excellent and addressed a lot of the issues with the doctor's character for nu-who.  
-Matt Smith's cameo was fantastic and made sense within the context of the show.  
-Clara's reaction to the doctor regenerating felt realistic and mature(unlike Rose's IMO)
-Diolauge, Costume design, and acting are fantastic as always.  
Cons:  
-First half felt a little scattered and fell into typical Moffat cliches.  
-Madame Vastra, Jenny, and Strax have been completely overused and IMO should be killed off at this point.  
-Vastra and Jenny don't have good chemistry and their constant referral to their marriage was poor writing. I am however impressed that they had an openly gay couple in the tv show who weren't being discriminated against by anyone for their sexuality and were allies with the heroes.  
-Cartoonish moments felt off and were really annoying. Luckily, they were used sparingly and TBF are nothing new for who.  
-Dinosaur went absolutely nowhere and should have been cut from the script.  
Final Opinion:  
Really great introduction to the new doctor with a cool villain but was slightly held back by some flaws. 8.75/10

Noble did all that you said he did, but in this line up with the much quicker and more dynamic number 10, Nobes looked off the pace a bit. He's been accused of slowing play down too much sometimes and to me it stood out a bit today. He was the slightest bit ponderous on the ball. Against Palace he got away with it. Won't happen against a dogged opponent. To me Kouyate was the best midfielder we had on the pitch again. As for Tomkins, I'll tell you what, I'm not sure I rate him anymore. For his size he simply isn't very strong. On defensive set plays he gets rag dolled regularly and his positioning can be very inconsistent. I don't know that I see him improving much more, He's been in the first team for a long time now but he hasn't claimed the position as his own at any time. I worry about our cb situation. And Adrian, I love his enthusiasm, his bravery and his apparent love for the club, but he reminds me a bit of Ginge. He's the Ginge of goalkeepers. He's steady but you can pretty much count on a clanger per match. He fumbled a few today when he was never particularly under pressure. Again, against a better side you get found out for your errors. I'm afraid I think Adrian more of a back-up calibre keeper. He and Tomkins do put me on edge a bit. All that said, it was nice  to see some decent passing football today. Hopefully this is a sign of things to come. We even snuck in an old school hoofball knock down to Carlton Cole special for nostalgia's sake.

It's the writing. 

Maybe we're supposed to be feeling the same as The Doctor, but it was just an un-focused mess. There was no flow, the pacing was *all over the place*, and it was way over-long.

The dialogue, at times, reminded me of one of those spliced-together fan videos on Youtube - with utterances taken from disparate sources and different contexts, and edited together in a completely new way... it was like the characters weren't actually *talking to each other*, just saying unconnected lines.

As new Doctor intros go, this doesn't have a patch on Smith's, Eccleston's, or even Tenant's (and certainly not Hurt's) intros... very disappointing.

He over-explains things until I start thinking, ""Oh... I guess they weren't that cool after all.""

His dialogue is usually decent (sometimes quite witty), and he's pretty inventive with story ideas, even if he goes a bit off the rails towards the end of them.

This had a bland, recycled story with recycled characters (I like the Victorian threesome, but I get it already, they're lesbians and Strax is an alien.  Do something else with them.), and most of the dialogue (and directing, for some odd reason) was choppy and nonsensical.  At the end of it I really thought ""Moffat wrote that?  It felt like it was done by committee.""  The only parts I liked were mostly Peter Capaldi monologues (examining himself in the alley and realizing the truths of his own situation only when confronting the clockwork man).

And please, please, please don't let the season arc be built around ""the doctor's crazy stalker chick who thinks they're dating/destined to be together.""  Very few people outside of their early teens behave this way, so having adults (or even ancient adults) make a convincing villain while acting like a dippy tween who read too much Twilight is not a recipe for compelling characters.

My first thought was that is was a young Madame Kovarian. She definitely looks like she could be her, and some of her line deliveries were very Kavarian-esqe. Like speaking very crisp and pointed and then drawing out the last syllable. 

But after re-watching that scene a few times, I realized she has other mannerisms that are not only not like Kavarian, but actually polar opposite of Kavarian. Kavarian was always cold and calm and rational. She walked very straight line with no messing about. Very militarily. 

But this Missy character is jumping around and throwing her arms out and seems to be pretty far from calm, cold, and rational. Her delivery of the line where she says in a whispered voice ""...paaaaraaadiiissseee"" kept running through my head and it reminded me of another character that would have delivered that line in the exact same way. Possibly the same character. 

The Master.

Dinosaur and Victorian times is fun and flash way to start while still making it not to bizarre to scare off viewers... 

and most importantly... holy shit Capaldi is amazing.

The idea you can say Capaldi is amazing and then jump down moffat's throat is banana's. Moffat delivered some of the best speeches and initial reactions of the doctor this whole series has seen. From the mirror scene, eyebrow rant, and then the face off with the villain at the end (also reminding me of FACE/OFF... hell yeah. Mirror reflection)

Scratch that. MOST importantly is that the whole episode felt like a clear and self aware response to the issues of the past season. The relationship between the doctor, the over reliance on timy whimy dialog, the fast and overstuffed pacing, the love saves everything ending. All are gone from this episode.

This leaves some people out of a job since the job market they are trained for saturated this then costs the state because we have to support them with 'job seekers allowance'. We could spend money retraining them which would be a better option but that would cost **even** more money and might just result in the same problem if yet more immigrants have entered our country. This leaves the demographics in a mess; we have tonnes of people trained for one job that has been saturated and other job markets with slithers of spaces ready to hire new people. 

I could go on, but if you use your knowledge of how our country is run if you have any(you don't even need that much) I'm sure you can imagine/speculate all the problems it puts on infrastructure that would cost far too much to just magically fix and then you might agree that policies on immigration would be the best place to start reform.

true,FlyingTinOpener,k9,K-9,"You need to take a step back and realize that this fan demand for ""darker"" and ""grittier"" is a distinctly US phenomenon because Doctor Who's US identity is almost exclusively an adult one.

The problem is that that's not what Doctor Who is. It's a *family* show. It's always been. There's a great deal of heritage there. Its identity in its home country is a show that entire families can tune into on Saturdays and watch without necessarily committing a great deal of brain power to its intricacies. It's supposed to be a bit light. It's supposed to be a bit air-headed. It's supposed to be a little bit stupid.

RTD, Gatiss or Moffat aren't incapable of delivering dark and gritty and adult. They're all pretty talented writers. They've done that kind of stuff both in and outside of the Whoverse. Their reluctance to go full blown dark and gritty in Doctor Who is a conscious choice that is driven by the British heritage they've inherited when they rebooted the series. The US fans don't always appreciate their direction with it because the US fans are demanding something from Doctor Who that it has *never* in its entire history made an effort to deliver. And when it predictably doesn't deliver, they fill these forums and subreddits complaining about it. I honestly don't get it. It's Doctor Who. What's the rationale in expecting it to be something that it has never ever been?

The bottom line is that you can always stop watching if it isn't to your liking. That's the way supply/demand works. If people who think like you constitute enough of the fan base, then the show's ratings are going to be wrecked and the writing/production crew will be forced to re-evaluate the thematic directions to bring you guys back. But until you prove otherwise, you are in the minority from the perspective of the creative team, and they're not going to be making the show to your liking. And even then they might frankly prefer to just take Doctor Who off the air instead of corrupting its multiple *decades* of family-friendly ""fluffiness"" with the gritty Hollywood treatment.

Every so often I seem to see a comment in /r/LiverpoolFC or /r/Soccer where someone states, 'But Rodgers said he'd never be in a Liverpool shirt...' And then I'm sitting here thinking, '...so?'

&gt;It's all irrelevant, of course.

Of course. We got a striker who has the ability to be absolutely amazing and I am looking forward to it.

At worst, I think Balotelli's mere presence on the pitch will draw enough focus from the opposition to be a distraction and create space for others.

&gt;
&gt;Iris' origins were initially unknown, but she claimed to be a Time Lady who grew up on Gallifrey in the House of Aunts, (PROSE: *The Scarlet Empress*) although the Doctor was unable to find any record of her on the planet. (AUDIO: *The Wormery*) The Eighth Doctor suggested Iris may have been a Faction Paradox creation. (PROSE: *Bafflement and Devotion*)
&gt;Iris later revealed her true origins as a member of a race known as the Clockworks, which originated in the Obverse. The Clockworks kept the multiverse structured and orderly. Iris found this dull, so she rebelled and stole the bus. (PROSE: *The Blue Angel*, AUDIO: *The Land of Wonder*)

I didn't get it all; I'll be real.

I *guess*? So once that 'boyfriend' veil is lifted, wham, the Impossible Girl can carry on? **No, I didn't get that.**

But I got a tad of humanity from the Doctor, and even more: *he's* evolving or maybe becoming more ""him"" (or more Time Lord) because that's what's going to be needed, maybe? And Ten or Eleven couldn't possibly have pushed that metal dude, but Twelve had *no qualms*. Wow. That means I'm going to like him more, right off the bat!

I loved the episode, though I didn't get it all. Capaldi's great; seeing Matt again was a tad heartbreaking, but Capaldi saying *that was him* was even more touching. I love the mystery, ""doctor who"". YES! Gimme more!

I liked the episode. However, I had some issues with the writing and some aspects of the Doctor's performance.

There was an [article](http://www.nerdist.com/2014/08/the-twelfth-doctor-will-be-a-mix-of-three-earlier-doctors/) about how the new doctor will be a combination of the previous 3 doctors. Watching the episode tonight I def saw mannerisms of 10th and 11th. I don't think they've really given the 12th Doctor to shine with a unique personality, and I hope this is something they remedy going forward.

It seems there was a lot of concern with taking the Doctor in a new direction. Perhaps this is because they're worried about the new Doctor being a bit darker, or a bit older, so they spent alot of time trying to remind us this is the same Doctor they we know and love. They did this by reflecting 10th and 11ths mannerisms a bit, and had the phone call scene at the end. They also tried to ease us into the new Doctor by placing us in a familiar setting with a supporting cast that we already known and are comfortable with.

I really think going forward they need to be brave enough to let Capaldi take the Doctor in a new direction with a unique personality rather then cling onto what we loved about the 9th, 10th, and 11th Doctors.

All I can imagine is that when Eleven *saved* her from his timeline, and Hurt was introduced, Eleven had hidden that part of himself from Clara, so maybe Clara is truly shocked by what Twelve is, even though he's the same.

&gt;

&gt;""__O Captain! My Captain!__"" is an [extended metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_metaphor) [poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poem) written in 1865 by [Walt Whitman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman), about the death of [American president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) [Abraham Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln). The poem was first published in the pamphlet *[Sequel to Drum-Taps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel_to_Drum-Taps)* which assembled 18 poems regarding the American Civil War, including another Lincoln elegy, *[When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Lilacs_Last_in_the_Dooryard_Bloom%27d)*. It was included in Whitman's comprehensive collection *[Leaves of Grass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaves_of_Grass)* beginning with its fourth edition published in 1867.

true,selorn,tennant,Tennant,"I agree.    I thought the episode was overall extremely strong compared to the recent stuff Moffat's overseen.   The second half of season 7 was particularly terrible, with Clara having pretty much no personality.   As you said, I'm finally starting to get an idea of who the hell she is other than yet another pretty girl.

Not to mention, the episode actually felt cohesive and coherent without having to go back and listen to the overly-rushed dialogue again.   A lot of that has to do with the running time, but I think a lot of credit should also be given to the story which kept the plot regarding the enemy simple, instead of trying to shoehorn in a ""world-threatening disaster"" or something.    

I'd also praise the choice of enemy, it's relatively novel but relies on a previous episode so that they didn't have to spend TOO long focusing on **why** robots are harvesting humans for ship-parts(you can just go and look it up).   It also really takes the idea of The Girl in the Fireplace to it's more disturbing implications.

true,HiHaterslol,lfc68,," Lazar Markovic is just 20 years old, but he already has a CV which would be the envy of many seasoned professionals. Three league titles in Serbia with Partizan Belgrade and one in Portugal with Benfica: that is some record.

So, does he expect to win the title this campaign with his new club, Liverpool? The answer is emphatic. “Of course.”

Flanked by an interpreter Markovic drifts comfortably between Serbian and English, delivering answers which brim with confidence and mischief.

Does he, for example, expect to establish himself as one of the Premier League’s best players? “Most likely. I am hoping so and I believe I will,” Markovic replies.

And what about the language barrier? “I understand most of it,” he says. “I only have a problem when journalists are asking the questions.” 



The broad grin spreading across his face makes it clear Markovic is teasing, but his ease at jousting with the reporters gathered around him underlines his deep sense of belief. And no wonder: a gifted attacking player, who was given the nickname ‘The Butterfly’ because of his elusive speed and dribbling, Markovic commanded a £20 million transfer fee as part of Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers’s prodigious squad strengthening this summer.

“I was lucky enough to play in Serbia and play in Portugal but although Liverpool is different I have experienced a lot so young and obviously that has given me confidence,” Markovic explains. So why Liverpool? “Firstly, it is one of the best clubs in the world. Secondly, it is one of the best leagues in the world and, thirdly, Liverpool are superior and the strongest team, in my opinion, in England.”

Rodgers has brought in nine first-team players in all – with Divock Origi on loan for a season – at a cost of more than £100 million, a sum largely funded by the £75 million sale of Luis Suárez. Mario Balotelli is the latest and most high-profile signing at a cut-price £16 million from AC Milan.

The prospect of playing alongside the mercurial Balotelli is one to relish. “Yes, I am excited – I love good players and want to play with good players,” Markovic says. “We are all competent and good enough to win the title. It’s the confidence that I feel.”

Markovic has already described Steven Gerrard as the “king” of Liverpool and is clearly keen to learn from the club captain. “He gives advice all the time,” he says. Does Markovic always listen to advice? “Only the good stuff,” is the typically cheeky response.

A hamstring injury has stalled Markovic’s Liverpool career so far – limiting him to a single appearance, 45 minutes against Olympiakos in the pre-season tour to the United States – but he is now fully fit and hoping to be involved in tomorrow night’s hugely significant Premier League match away to the champions, Manchester City.

The game represents something of a reunion for Markovic: the City squad includes fellow Serbs Matija Nastasic and Aleksander Kolarov, plus the Montenegrin Stevan Jovetic.

“I spoke to them before I came here because I knew them and I’ve been in contact with them since I have been at Liverpool as well,” Markovic says. “I am quite good friends with Matija and with Jovetic as well – we speak every day.”

Markovic is from Cacak, in west-central Serbia, a town with a population of just under 75,000 but still renowned for its sporting prowess. Markovic was a good tennis and basketball player. “It’s famous for football. My brother Filip plays football. My father played football. They are similar players to me.”

Nevertheless, his father Negoslav did not rise higher than the amateur ranks and it was his brother, two years his elder, who was first spotted by Partizan.

“My brother was a big talent,” Markovic says. “But he was young and my family was not keen for him to go too early. I ended up going with him. They wanted my brother first but we followed him as a family and I ended up playing for Partizan.”

Both Markovic brothers joined the Partizan academy, the famed Youth School Belin, and Lazar progressed quickly, making his first-team debut at 17. Soon he was “winning a few titles” and coming to the attention of other clubs.

While Filip, an attacking midfielder, now plays for Real Mallorca in Spain, Lazar was initially being linked with a big-money move to Chelsea. “I was a Chelsea fan as a child because I liked Gianfranco Zola,” Markovic says. “I loved everything about him, the way he played.”

A poster of the Italian was above Markovic’s bed and he still dreams of emulating his joyous style. “Zola is the only one, but it will be possible. It is possible to be similar to Zola, but Zola is Zola.”

The link to Chelsea remained, even after his move to Benfica, with the Portuguese boasting a strong relationship with the west London club having sold the likes of David Luiz, Ramires and another Serb, Nemanja Matic, to Stamford Bridge.

Markovic enjoyed another outstanding season last year – even if he was denied an appearance in the Europa League final after a bizarre sending-off against Juventus in the semi-final when he clashed with Mirko Vucinic – but ultimately it was Liverpool who made their move.

“I watched Liverpool – I watched every one of their games last season because I love the Premier League,” Markovic says. “Their style of football is one of the main reasons why I came here. Last season, only bad luck played a part in the outcome: Liverpool were the best team.”

The scale of the fee for him is of no concern to Markovic and neither, he adds, is money a motivation. “I am not money‑orientated,” he says. “If I was money-orientated I would have gone somewhere else.”

Would that have been Chelsea? Markovic laughs. “I love Liverpool.”",0,1408862563,null,0,false,0,cjyybrc,t3_2ee9zd,t1_cjyybrc,t1_cjywlde,null,1427384844,15,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,15

true,Granny_Weatherwax,tardis,TARDIS,"Weird little things bothered me. Where does the mop bucket go? Strax  never lifts it off the table, it's just gone in the next shot. People definitely wrote shit down in the early 1800s, especially in London. How do we explain the complete erasure of a giant dinosaur from history? What the hell kind of dinosaur was that? 

Strax still can't discern that Clara is female, and despite spending years in the human world of the past he doesn't know hair from a hat? Wasn't he supposed to be a semi-intelligent character at one point? He's just a caricature of himself. I love when the extreme fantasy of Doctor Who feels grounded in reality by at least the most rudimentary of tethers. Also did this episode go a bit overboard with the CGI or is it just me? It was like George Lucas had visited. There won't be much to visit at the Dr. Who museum of the future from this run, the whole set is digital. Everything felt really wacky, not like eccleston/tennant wacky/charming. I mean like it's gone all Dr, Suess here. 

I know this feels nitpicky but what I really want to know is- how did Clara, a woman from 2014 figure out how to perfectly do her hair like that, exactly to period standard? How long did it take her? How did she even know how to put on a bustle? That shit is complicated. To do both by herself and be down in time for breakfast on the first try seems really unlikely.


These in addition to a saccharine hollow feeling in the ""look at me scene"" have me wanting to try again. I'm gonna give this episode a mulligan and see if I like the next one. I do love ""missy"", obviously ""The mistress"", evil Mary Poppins!!! I had a whole fan thing worked out about the doctor doing exactly this, regenerating as female and becoming the inspiration for P.L. Tavers, this was before we knew Capaldi had been cast and I was among those hoping for a lady doctor.

They intended to take the brain of the original [Madame de Pompadour](https://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Madame_de_Pompadour), for they believed only it could serve as the new onboard computer.

I've no doubt the media is going to be all over him for the first few months. Of course they will. Without Suarez, there was no villain in the league until now. They'll try to wind him up. Perhaps it will draw the attention of some of our resources away from their jobs because they have to keep an eye on him, but hopefully he's become strong enough over the last 18 months he's been away to help himself as well. Plus, players like Gerrard, Lovren, Agger (if he's still here) and Hendo et al and staff like Rodgers, Peters, etc won't stand for that whatsoever.

I DID however thoroughly enjoy the episode as a whole.

Some negative points:  
* Lesbian lesbian lizard married lesbian lesbian kiss. (WE GET IT ALREADY)  
* The ""Trial of Clara's Faith"" felt like a conversation with the fans who were unhappy with the choice of an older, more grizzled doctor.  
* Strax's Happy-go fun time adventures! Feature more carnival sound effects than ever!  
* This is more nebulous, but the characters in general didn't feel like themselves, and their resolution felt flimsy. Had I been Lady Vastra in this episode, I'd be rather angry at everyone else being complete twits. I also would NOT have let Clara off the hook that easily.

Some positives:  
* The Old Doctor pleading with Clara to help the New Doctor (or was it the ""new"" doctor pleading with the ""old"" doctor?)  
* Lady Vastra's veil disappearing mid-rant. Such a nice and subtle touch.  
* The Doctor owning up to his errors driven by emotion in previous incarnations.  
* The villain. The Android/Cyborg felt compelling, but maybe that's because clockwork people SCARE THE HELL OUTTA ME.  

One thing that I wonder is just how long the Doctor was actually gone before he came back for Clara.

For me, my main concern would be whether he could be a problem in the dressing room. Addressing that: 1. He's immature and he drives managers mental, but is he really a toxic presence like he's made out to be? The one example I can think of of his being a problematic influence was with Roberto Mancini, and *the entire dressing room* abandoned him, Mario was just the only one dumb enough to be passive aggressive about it. He might be indisciplined, he might break the rules, but he's in a position where the club don't have to worry too much about punishing him if that happens. 2. His teammates seem to love him, and his ex-managers largely speak of him with affection, so while he may be hard to control he doesn't seem like the kind of guy to cause rifts. 3. I think the spirit and focus of the dressing room can handle distractions. There's enough leaders and good influences there and a sharp enough coaching staff to I think deal with any of these vague ""squad harmony"" issues or whatever.

Capaldi has to establish his personality, and show us how he acts when the ground starts to fall out from under his feet.

I was kind of annoyed at all the ham-fisted stuff trying to get [Clara/the fanbase] to accept him, but hopefully that will be put in the past and we'll just see his personality going forward, and it should work.

I don't expect him to be everybody's favorite Doctor.  We all have our reasons for loving one over another.  After watching this episode, I do think he can pull off being the Doctor for however long his run is.  I'm glad he's not just another Eccleston or Tennant or Smith.

This is a manager who went on international tv to criticise Levy for not offering him a new contract because it would unsettle the players (after whoring himself to the England job for months with obvious consequences until he realised he wouldn't get it) - immediately after Daniel's mother had passed away.

A man who was acquitted by a jury of tax fraud using a defence so inadequate it boggles the mind.

A man who masturbated to the press about how well AVB should be doing, despite AVB doing as good a job with a worse squad, and unquestionably developing our players (Bale, Lennon, Defoe, Sandro etc).

A man who managed to persuade us all that young prospects or big money buys like Bostock, Caulker, Bentley, dos Santos, Pav etc were all failings only because they failed to develop themselves. Brought no youth players in and instead recommended signing players like Ryan fucking Nelsen and the ghost of Louis Saha as replacements, continuing the ruinous buy-everyone policy he bankrupted each of his former clubs with and which he relegated QPR with last season.

He criticised the fans repeatedly in the press, calling us deluded and referring to the club as ""they"", telling us how lucky we are and saying things like ""oh yeah, they were in the champions league every year before I came here"" and ""when I came here we had two points from eight games"" every fucking second.

Whether he honestly believes he was some fucking mystic who transformed a terrible relation threatened side into a godly juggernaut I don't know, but I know that by historic league finishes, the people actually responsible are Levy, Comolli(!) and Jol.

He is a self-promoting self-interested angry mediocre windbag and while I enjoyed the good times (CL run, Bale Lennon Modders Thudd), I don't forget the fucking atrocious way he treated the club and its fans and I do not enjoy the endless teat suckling from the press.

The Doctor reached out to her for consolement and she effectively rejected him.  She basically told him, ""No, find someone else.""  I can't imagine anything she could have done that would hurt him more.

Listening to River that episode and her earlier descriptions of him during ""A Good Man Goes to War"" and the ""Library"" two parter, I've begun to wonder if he was every allowed to be just a man with her, was he ever allowed to have a weak moment?  What must being married to her have been like?  I really wish they had given us more time with her after the wedding.  I would have liked the chance to compare and contrast their relationship to that of Amy and Rory.
 
Edit:

I think it's also necessary to take River's childhood into account.  On the one hand she was raised and trained to consider the Doctor as one of the most dangerous people in the universe and equipped to kill him, on the other she grew up hearing stories about the magical raggedy doctor from Amy.  It doesn't seem to leave a lot of space for the Doctor to be vulnerable with her.

- the hold your breath thing isn't logical. All the robots are connected to the main guy, so he would recognize Clara by sight as an outsider, plus her beating heart and sweating body would give her away hell the smell of her would give her away. 

- a hot air balloon made of skin  is their spaceship? If they have the tech to teleport a dinosaur and incinerate it, couldn't they make a space worthy-ship. It's picturesque, and screams steampunk, but it's too on the nose.

- that battle! Clunky and not believable. But also, unnecessary. They were fighting just to fight, they weren't trying to rescue anyone. Holding their breath in the heat of battle doesn't make sense

- immediately after the battle the doctor goes away and doesn't say why. Clara starts to think she is being stranded in Victorian England. He returns and doesn't have an explanation and it never serves any plot  purpose except to get Clara upset.

So I don't see what your insurer has to do with it at all, as far as I'm aware it's normal for you to need the combination of named driver in named vehicle for a policy to be in force. (Excluding exceptions like driving another vehicle under your own policy, but that wouldn't apply in this scenario)

But I am not in insurance, so I can't say for sure.

If you want them to pay out for the car, however...you can't have your cake and eat it too. You said the car was bought by someone, so you surely have the money from the sale, so why would you need your insurer to pay out for it?

The way I see it, the buyer should be prosecuted for driving without valid insurance, since your policy wouldn't be valid for him driving the vehicle, and your insurance shouldn't be affected, and you shouldn't expect to be paid for the vehicle by your insurer, since it's been sold and is now not your property and therefore not your loss.

They had some fantastic episodes during that series which were just ruined by Donna Knoble.  There is still humour in Moffat's writing, his season long story arcs are better, his one off  monsters are better and his referencing the past is better.

I thing Davis era was marred by poor companions but then episodes like World War 3, Fear Her, Absorbalof, the constant inclusion of Roses' family, barely ever leaving earth.  I think the show has been far far better under Moffat. The Silence, River, Amy, Impossible Girl storylines have all been interesting, tying back in the crack in the universe to Smith's first and last episode was great, the 50th was fantastic, Smith was amazing and Capaldi looks set to be the same.

I dont know where all the criticism comes from when people complain about Moffat.  I know some people think he ran jokes into the ground etc, maybe I'm just a fan of that kind of humour - I would consider Coupling to be one of my favourite British Comedies ever - but it only adds to the show for me.

One concern I do share is propensity for sulking. In general he works hard but when frustrated he can sulk and look disinterested ( which is a ridiculous thing for a pro footballer to do)

Another is his wastefulness, most of his goals last year were from frees (he is better than Suarez no joke) and pens. In play he didn't score too much and he shot from stupid angles/ranges a lot. Hopefully this is more down to the terrible service he received there rather than a lack of nous.

true,JRM_Elephant,lfc87,,"&gt; His story, though, is not quite so simple. Markovic was born in Cacak, a town more renowned for producing basketball players than footballers. His father had played in Yugoslavia’s second division for the local club, Borac, and soon both of his sons — Filip, the elder by two years, and Lazar — were enrolled in Borac’s academy. Both were quick, both nimble, both wide players who loved to cut inside. Lazar’s room was decorated with posters of his favourite team, Chelsea, and in particular with images of Gianfranco Zola, his childhood hero. It was, though, Filip who seemed the more promising, and by the time he was 14, word had spread that deep in basketball country there was a player worth watching. Partizan dispatched Nedeljko Kostic, the head of their academy, and Sladjan Scepovic, their scout, to take a look. They were impressed. They agreed a deal with Borac, only to discover that Filip’s father insisted they sign Lazar, 12, too.

My hope is that he'll embrace the culture at Liverpool. I know that a lot of respected managers and coaches have tried to tame him, but I think the difference between Rodgers and the other people who have tried is that Rodgers will toss Balotelli out faster than he signed him if Balo is a problem. When Balo realizes that, I'm thinking he might just get with the program.

A lot of Italian players have praised Mario for how much he has matured recently, for me his problems lay on the pitch, where he lets his frustrations get the better of him and he performs poorly or refuses too because of it, Suarez was the polar opposite and used frustrations to motivate his performance. That is the problem he has and I hope he and the staff will begin to change that about his game, on his day he is fantastic, in my eyes we have a player that is capable of scoring 10-15 goals a season if he under performs or if he takes his game to new levels where he's always expected to perform at, he'll score over 20 goals a season for us, for £16m, we have little to lose, especially when you compare that price to other signings.",0,1408876714,null,0,false,0,cjz0ybs,t3_2effua,t1_cjz0ybs,t3_2effua,null,1427383546,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Pay spines are fairly common here, especially in large organisations; the university I work for also uses one, with all staff on the same unified structure.  It's a good system, and trends mostly towards being meritorious; people often try to take on a few of the responsibilities of the band above them to demonstrate that their ability is becoming consummate with a higher band, which makes them a stronger candidate for promotion later.

Which is probably to do with them being the big Empire in the world. They do not like to reflect on when they lost, only the victories and what they claim as victories.

But Britain won the war. But we also were not too interested in the war. We had bigger fish to fry in the form of Napoleon. We wanted the war with America over quickly. So when we forced them to the negotiation table after having gained many victories we surprised them by offering them more than generous terms. We basically agreed to return to the status quo of everything being the same before the war had begun. We did not have time for long drawn out negotiations, we wanted to divert some recourses back to Europe.

And obviously they leapt at our terms and accepted.

Now here is why the Americans think that it ended up a victory for them. After they agreed terms it took awhile for the new of this to get back to the continent of North America because the terms had been discussed here in the UK. So they still thought the war was going on when in fact it ended which led to the Battle of New Orleans, a battle the US won.

&gt;""So it's probably a £200 million a year subsidy to the BBC.""

The guy is an idiot. £160 million to pay for Scottish services and infrastructure, and then £200 million as the Scottish license fee payers contribution for: content for 8 national TV channels (inc 2 childrens TV channels plus Red Button services), National and international news services, 10 national radio stations, BBC online and the administrative costs of the BBC.

Is it the plots/stories?  (Because when a show first starts/restarts, it always takes a bit for it to find its feet - this is true for almost all shows, and there will always be hit-and-miss episodes).

Or is it the subject overall - the space and time travelling fella who picks up girls and takes them on adventures throughout the universe?  Because, um...yeah.  That's Doctor Who.

I just think it would be a statement to all the guys at Everton - even the best defensive pairing we have (which is Jags and Distin, no doubt, and I will never throw Sylvain under the bridge on 2 poor performances after all he's done) is at risk and needs to always be performing constantly for the 90 mins.

Strax is a Sontaran that was added primarily for comic relief, (he's basically a side kick for episodes on Earth). The Lizbian couple are friends of his, together they are a trio that assist the Docter from time to time since Matt smith befriended them, but they do not travel with him.

Amy and Rory got trapped in New York by weeping Angels in a time period the Docter could not reach due to a time lock. They were happy and together though and lived out their lives in the past.

Clara was a mystery, initially encountered with Amy and Rory she turned out to be a Dalek who was formerly human and did not realise she had changed she spoke over the radio like a human was not reviled until the end of the episode, after discovering the truth the Dalek sacrifices itself to save the Docter Amy and Rory. The end of that.

Until, after losing Amy and Rory the Docter is in Victorian London (with the Trio) and encounters Clara (same person the Dalek was previously) it appears she will join the Docter then but at the end of the episode she also sacrifices her own life to save the docter, leaving a confusing paradox for the views.

The Docter then finds another Clara this one and takes her as his companion (to investigate what was going on). Adventure ensues... At the finale Clara throws her self into the Docter's time stream (his past) spawning multiple incarnations of herself throughout his history of lives, each ones purpose being to save the Docter (this explain the Claras encountered previously). Clara who jumps into the time stream does not die however and lives on as his current companion.

ADDITIONALLY. In the 50th anniversary episode it is revealed that the Docter did NOT wipe out the time lords as he believed and that somewhere in the universe (trapped in a painting) is Galifray still exists, thus he is absolved of the guilt he previously carried.

Matt Smite died (of old age?) as the last regeneration but clara said ""please sir can I have some more"" and he was given another one (this actually happened)

true,badebola,lfc55,,"I mean its a nice theory to hear as a Liverpool fan but its pretty clear that John Green doesn't really understand what he's talking about, and that his theory is mostly based on conjecture.

Fowler snorted cocaine to mock Media reports as if to say it was laughable that he would do it. Hardly offensive or childish.

Bellers never drunkenly beat Riise, he drunkenly threatened Riise and never made contact. Bellamy was also in the media constantly and was pegged as an unpredictable wildboy, who no one wanted to take a chance on. 

Also, theres no doubt that Balotelli is lazy. Messi is lazy defensively because he's been given orders to by his managers, while Balotelli is often criticized by his managers. Balotelli is the type of player that when he's not feeling it, won't make that run, won't play that extra pass, and won't be in the position he needs to be in to create space.

Balotelli deserves his reputation 100%. At liverpool we're not hoping that his reputation isn't true, but rather that he's going to change it.

Do I think racism may play a part in it? Ehhh maybe. I mean I'd be upset too if I was raised in Italy as a black male, and had Juve fans unfolding banners telling me I'd never be Italian because I was black.

true,kaiserbun,null,null,"This is all quite correct in some fashion but you're overlooking the central point which had little to do with the specific strategy and everything to do with the effect the war had on overall US war policy. In short, it made us more like you and considering the timeframes involved that happened in remarkably short order.

Elsewhere in this Duxal makes a crack about Gun Control, a reference to our Second Amendment. The Second Amendment was codified, regardless of what a great many number of gun enthusiasts in the US today believe btw, as part of a greater overall strategy of using state militia forces, not simply as reserves for the national defense, but as part of a more piece-meal system that would, in theory, provide for the national defense almost totally in times of national war emergency.

The problem was the system was fundamentally flawed. The architects of the constitution were worried about a great many things that mostly had to do with relations between states situated together on such a vast land mass. What they generally gloss over in US schools is how crucial the French alliance was to victory during the revolution. I say generally because I learned about it because I was educated in a school disctrict where 91% of students go on to higher education and we talked about these things in class. (The national average is around 17%).

The whole reason for the milita system-experiment was to avoid having to maintain a standing national army. Not only did we not have the money for one, but there was a strong fear that having such an army would cause serious problems for both state and national sovereignty. Back then state sovereignty was such a big deal that many of the damn fools screaming loudest about it did so without much care at all to the national issue. They fancied themselves as independent countries really, particularly in the South, and this sentiment, though completely ridiculous by any practical measures, still flows strongly though attitudes in the southern and western states to this day.

The War of 1812 changed all that. In the early stages of the war, even before the battles started, there were huge problems with regimental morale, training standards, and above all discipline. You had war college graduates serving as officers to corps of men who didn't respect them in any capacity due to class, state origin, and about a thousand other factors and the system had no remedy for that. The state fighting units that were fit were fit for all the usual reasons but those reasons were not applicable to units from other states. 

The biggest shift though was the Navy. In the decade or so between the end of the Revolution and the first stirrings of 1812 there was a highly charged debate about whether the US should have our own national Naval fleet and how that should work. The same fears about standing Armies were even more acute when it came to the Navy. The only fear greater was a repeat of the disasters that befell the US ""fleet"" at the hands of the British Navy in New York, from the harbor areas all the way up the Hudson and Delaware rivers. In the end it was decided the US needed a standing Navy complete with Marines and that we needed to invest much more effort into improving the overall technology involved.

Forget the war aims, the biggest impact on the US was the dissolution of a lot of the Fear that existed before 1812. The fear that the English forces would try to hook up once again with the Indian nations in northern NY through Canada and attempt to sweep down through the Hudson and the Delaware valleys. These weren't realistic considering the global situation, but back then, particularly on the local level, the fears of people from families that had lost more than a few men already in the struggle to control the continent, were real enough to not simply let Napoleon or whomever worry about the British Threat. 

That was the real ""victory"" or 1812 for the US. We didn't care so much that you burned Washington, the important part was that you went away and stopped bothering us for a second time and now we had a proper army and navy to prevent it from happening a third.

true,Catholic_Spray,null,null,"I think you are wrong. First of all his price tag suggest that the transfer won't be a mistake no matter what. We are paying 16 million for a huge potential for a 24 year old. If he does not succeed at Liverpool, he will still bring a lot of new fans, increased interest and a shitload of sold shirts. To put it in perspective.. other teams are paying similar prices for Shane long etc. Hell, Sunderland accepted 14 mill pounds for Borini. 

Balo has everything you could want in a striker. He is also more mature now than ever (ref: Pirlo, Kaka etc) he already has PL experience and might now be heading into the best years of his career.

I do think you have a valid point when it comes to his pressing. Studge does not press as much as he could and I am not sure how it will work with both Studge and Balo on top. This does not benefit Stevie, which legs aren't what they use to be. I think this is something BR needs to address.

However, all reports suggest that there are behavior terms, pay cuts and such. This tells me that Balo is committed and BR is already addressing the same concerns we have already discussed in this sub. 

When it comes to the attention thing. I am not sure how right you are when you say he needs to be in the center of it. I don't know, I just don't think that will be a problem. As a Liverpool supporter I might be a bit biased here, but I think the reception he got at Melwood and the reception he will get at Anfield is something he has not experienced before. He will be adored here and I think it really is something he is longing for.

The signing might be a sign of desperation, but I think it also very well might be a blessing. Possibly even signing of the decade for that price and at this stage in Balo's career.",0,1408882671,null,0,false,0,cjz2123,t3_2effua,t1_cjz2123,t3_2effua,null,1427383045,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

If you follow the news, you know what the NSA and GCHQ can do. If it's the Five Eyes that are after you, no amount of VPN, TOR and TrueCrypt are going to keep you safe. And I in no way encourage you to do anything illegal.

To quote them from the response they provided to TF for the 2014 VPN update:

&gt;* We absolutely do not log any traffic nor session data of any kind, period. We have worked hard to meticulously fork all daemons that we utilize in order to achieve this functionality. It is definitely not an easy task, and we are very proud of our development team for helping Private Internet Access to achieve this unique ability.

&gt;* We operate out of the US which is one of the few, if only, countries without a mandatory data retention law. We explored several other jurisdictions with the help of our professional legal team, and the US is still ideal for privacy-based VPN services.
&gt;We severely scrutinize the validity of any and all legal information requests. That being said, since we do not hold any traffic nor session data, we are unable to provide any information to any third-party. Our commitment and mission to preserve privacy is second to none.

&gt;* We do not monitor any traffic, period. We block IPs/ports as needed to mitigate abuse when we receive a valid abuse notification.

&gt;* We do not host any content and are therefore unable to remove any of said content. Additionally, our mission is to preserve and restore privacy on the Internet and society. As such, since we do not log or monitor anything, we’re unable to identify any users of our service.

&gt;* Once again, we do not log any traffic or session data. Additionally, unlike the EU and many other countries, our users are protected by legal definition. For this reason, we’re unable to identify any user of our service. Lastly, consumer protection laws exist in the US, unlike many other countries. We must abide by our advertised privacy policy.

&gt;* We do not discriminate against any kind of traffic/protocol on any of our servers, period. We believe in a free, open, and uncensored internet.

&gt;* Bitcoin, Ripple, PayPal, Google Play (Mobile), OKPay, CashU, Amazon and any major Gift Card. We support plenty of anonymous payment methods. For this reason, the highest risk users should definitely use Bitcoin, Ripple or a major gift card with an anonymous e-mail account when subscribing to our privacy service.

&gt;* We’re the only provider to date that provides a plethora of encryption cipher options. We recommend, mostly, using AES-128, SHA1 and RSA2048.

Short and simple version is: whilst we were too busy to defend British Canada, because of Napoleon and shit, the Americans thought that they would be able to steamroller through Canada and invaded Ontario. The Canadians did a better job than was expected and held the Americans off for a couple of years, but they were slowly losing the war. In 1814 the British turned up and caught the Americans off guard, hence D.C got fucked up. The Americans fought back a tad and a stalemate ensued for nearly a year until the British and Americans decided that it wasn't really worth it, and called a truce. This war was important because the treaties that followed marked a significant improvement in American and British relations.

Option A: Spend 600,000 to expand Stamford bridge by 14,000 seats. Taking us to 55,000.

Option B: Spend &lt; 600,000 to create a new stadium with 60,000 seats plus, placing us only behind only behind Old Trafford, with income coming from the sale of the current stadium, plus we can continue to play at the Bridge whilst the new stadium is worked on.",0,1408890048,null,0,false,0,cjz3yy4,t3_2eec1u,t1_cjz3yy4,t1_cjyss0z,null,1427382138,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

When you mention something over-and-over-and-over again, it snaps you out of the fantasy and more into the realization it is a political statement.  For me, doing things like that make a 'cute couple' into an annoying, 'we're here, we're queer, get used to it!' type situation.

Because of The Empty Child, Girl in the Fireplace and Blink (my all time favorite episodes), I can't agree.  He's a phenomenal writer, who is very hit or miss.

In contrast in the 2014 Economic Freedom Index published by the Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC, Kazakhstan has gained 22 points over the past 17 years, which is noted by the authors as among the 20 best improvements recorded by any country. Kazakhstan ranks 11th out of 42 countries in the Asia–Pacific region, and its overall score is above the world and regional averages.

* Despite the above, be prepared to flaunt and take advantage of your sexy Irish accent, even if you're from a hole like Ballymena and sound like Brad Pitt in Snatch.
* Have fun!

&gt;
&gt;Iris' origins were initially unknown, but she claimed to be a Time Lady who grew up on Gallifrey in the House of Aunts, (PROSE: *The Scarlet Empress*) although the Doctor was unable to find any record of her on the planet. (AUDIO: *The Wormery*) The Eighth Doctor suggested Iris may have been a Faction Paradox creation. (PROSE: *Bafflement and Devotion*)
&gt;Iris later revealed her true origins as a member of a race known as the Clockworks, which originated in the Obverse. The Clockworks kept the multiverse structured and orderly. Iris found this dull, so she rebelled and stole the bus. (PROSE: *The Blue Angel*, AUDIO: *The Land of Wonder*)

Before Matt was announced I'd already seen him in a few things and I trusted his ability as an actor. I quite liked his performance over the first few appearances, I thought he had a lot of potential. But he never became my favourite, and I wasn't distraught to see him go. That was 99% due to the awful episodes he was given rather than his ability, but to be fair he was responsible for his portrayal of a character I thought was poorly written. Perhaps another actor with a different interpretation would have made me feel differently about certain aspects of the 11th's reign. 

I feel the same thing happening with Capaldi. I know he's a decent actor, I saw glimpses of greatness in him in this episode, but it was entirely overshadowed by how empty and overplayed this episode was.

I guess my point is that there is a huge amount of uncertainty about money in a post-independence scenario, and nobody is looking at the possibility that it could a cause a panic. Certainly, if I had Scottish banknotes or even an account in a Scottish bank, I would be taking protective measures.

Meh. I sort of learned how to use them eventually but I'm not all that fussed. Might get some for the odd night out but otherwise, nah. Also, it's far easier to terrorise people when you look like a school mistress with my glasses, and I quite like that.

---

&gt;After the outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany, Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty and a member of the War Cabinet, as he had been during the first part of the First World War. When they were informed, the Board of the Admiralty sent a signal to the Fleet: ""Winston is back.""   In this position, he proved to be one of the highest-profile ministers during the so-called ""[Phoney War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoney_War),"" when the only noticeable action was at sea and the USSR attack on Finland. Churchill advocated the pre-emptive occupation of the neutral Norwegian [iron-ore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_ore) port of [Narvik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narvik) and the iron mines in [Kiruna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_iron_ore_during_World_War_II), Sweden, early in the war. However, Chamberlain and the rest of the [War Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Cabinet) disagreed, and the operation was delayed until the successful [German invasion of Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_campaign).

1.  obviously Dunne can't play. It has to be onuaha, and redknapp is a fool if he thinks otherwise
2.  the 3-5-2 might have to go. The back 3 needs help from the wing backs, especially when Rio and dunne are in. Therefore Our midfield is overmatched because its 3 versus four or 5 opposition players. 5 in the back leaves us incapable of going forward effectively but also defending in the middle of the field
3.  fer needs time to get adjusted. Very unfair to toss him in today and expect even a decent performance.
4.  there is no life in the attack. No one wants to run at defenders or make anything happen. I think hoilett needs to play, even at the expense of Mitch, who has been sub-par.

&gt;Under the Regulations the authorised banks are required to hold backing assets for their banknotes at all times. In the event of an authorised bank entering an insolvency process as defined in the Regulations, those assets will be ring-fenced for one year or any longer period that HM Treasury may decide, for the sole purpose of reimbursing noteholders through a Note Exchange Programme. - from StonedPhysicist's link.

iii) It's fomenting hatred.  Want to see how poisonous this stuff is?  Take feminist writing and switch the genders.  Much of it is verging on outright bigotry.

iv) It's bad for women.  It's portraying women as helpless victims.  It infantilizes them and removes their agency.

v) It's anti-intellectual.  Not only is much feminist ideology completely fact-free, but it's invested in attacking our centers of knowledge production and our intellectuals.  Witness, the childish complaints about mansplaining.

Ideological feminism is attracted to post-modernist Marxist dialectics.  It's anti-rational.  It's poisoning our discourse.

I was a little offended by the ""reveal"" that the cyborg things were the sister ship to *SS Madame de Pompadour*. It felt like a cheap attempt to wring a little more out of a great episode, rather than a reference or whatever it was meant to be. Like they were trying to make it credible by tacking it on to something better than what it was. I didn't care about them at all, and the dinosaur bit was honestly just dull. 

I've felt this way for a long time but ever since 10's reign ended the episodes have largely felt like previous plots shuffled and restacked into new inferior episodes, with a few exceptions. There's a vast difference between making a reference or an homage, or even continuing an old story, and cannibalizing it for a cheap plot point. I can't really pin point my issue, but they can't seem to just let things live, they keep sucking like a parasite. First angel episode? Awesome. Angels in the catacombs? Actually pretty good, in a different way. Subsequent appearances? Terrible. First instance of time traveling murderous robots who repair with human remains? Awesome. Second? Bloody dull, and it almost blemished the original with how poor it was. 

They've had a total hard on for victorian london as of late, which makes it boring, not exciting. If they go into the past I like it to be educational or inspiring or have historical characters etc, and if they go into the future I love their sci-fi visions and technology etc. This episode had neither of that so they might as well have just stayed in the TARDIS.

Honestly they could have just dropped Clara and 12 on a hill and had them walk around the country for 45 minutes and I would have enjoyed it more.

Although I have to say, Strax hitting Clara with the newspaper was brilliant.",0,1408894394,null,0,false,0,cjz5j6g,t3_2ef843,t1_cjz5j6g,t1_cjz3735,null,1427381410,11,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,11

true,Squonkster,pertwee,Pertwee,"Tom Baker (the longest of the Classic doctors at 7 years) had 41 stories with a total of 172 20-minute episodes, including one 2-part serial, 5 6-parters and the rest being 4-part stories.  

David Tennant (longest of the revival docs) had 36 complete stories (not counting the shorts like ""Children in Need"" and ""Time Crash"") with a total of 46 episodes (including specials). His stories included 20 stand-alone 45-minute episodes, 8 two-part stories, one 3-parter (""Utopia""/""Sound of Drums""/""Last of the Time Lords""), and 7 specials running 60-75 minutes each.  

Yes, not everything matches up equally in terms of actual minutes televised. But you're also looking at two completely different television formats. Given the Classic series' slower-moving pace and serialized format, which adds several minutes of recap and cliffhanger buildup/resolution to each episode, you really can't just do a 1:1 comparison of numbers of episodes.

EDIT: Whelp, I was way off initially and miscounted Ten's stories, he had 36 not 46 which kinda negated the point I was trying to make about most number of stories. Still, I'm leaving this up since I did a lot of (mis)calculations and I like datas. :) And Tennant still had more stories than the next classic runner-up, Hartnell (27).",0,1408894737,null,0,1408898687,0,cjz5nxz,t3_2ef843,t1_cjz5nxz,t1_cjz1lx2,null,1427381349,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

true,sevendaysky,null,null,"I'm thinking more on their first exchanges with each other. The Doctor repeatedly doesn't recognize her, which is... well, understandable (and Clara has some knowledge that this was going to happen, of course) but understanding does not equate acceptance.  Someone with a loved one who has dementia (or other mental condition of a similar vein) walks in there hoping to be recognized, to have a tender moment, understanding that they might not have one. Doesn't mean they can't feel terrible when their loved one does not recognize them.  

When your SO comes home with a new haircut you only take five minutes because these are not material changes to your SO's personality.  Hair washes out, etc; we're talking new face, new attitude.  He still has the memories, but he's different.  THAT'S what she has to deal with in a very short period of time, even before we get into the whole 'she was in love with him (past him)' thing.  

And it really isn't fair to compare Clara to anyone else I don't think - on the basis that they are individuals.  One person's ""okay"" is another person's ""not okay,"" and vice versa. It's easy for us to sit back and say ""PFFFT I totally would have been ok in five minutes, she's a (insert insult here)!"" If it was a different set of circumstances she might very well have been OK with it in a much shorter time span. Maybe WE would have been OK - and a different situation - not okay.  

The writers wanted to portray something here. I don't think, in this case, Clara's ""slowness"" (again, subjective and I disagree that the pacing was too slow) is any reflection on her as a character, but about the writers' interest in reintroducing them to one another.  Too easy to just go ""whoop yep you're my doctor let's go do this shit!"" two minutes into the show. Faster? Yeah, but this way we see more facets of their individual personalities as they begin to learn how to address one another again.

true,sirbruce,null,null,"Like someone else said, reconstructions of every episode exist with full audio track and still pictures.  That said, some of them can be extremely painful to watch, given the low picture quality and very ""slow"" pace.  The ""historicals"" are particularly bad, and then the times were something actually happens, often all you hear is scuffling or fighting and you don't know what's actually going on.  Still, you will get the COMPLETE stories, and won't miss anything.

My best advice is to be patient and power through it.  Maybe 1 in 3 of the Hartnell and Troughton episodes are worth watching.  But they get better, and once you get to the third doctor there is no missing video (although a few are only in black and white).

Good pacing is still a problem during many of the third and fourth doctor episodes, particularly during the longer series.  You have to remember these were stretched out and you only got an episode every week, so viewers didn't notice it as much as we do today where we like everything in 1 hour bites or less.  Some of the Baker episodes suffer from significant ""overlap"" where they just replay the last 5+ minutes of the previous episode.

Reading the TARDIS Wiki after each serial might help in putting it in context and enjoying bits of trivia.

Amazon is a bit annoying really. Last time I checked they did have some decent movies on there like The Goonies but you have to be really careful because some of the videos will actually cost you money despite paying for Amazon Prime.

On these sorts of games you need luck because Tottenham is a £150m squad. They will be pushing for champions league this season. We are just the first to go under the knife. If any team in the bottom half of the league had come up against spurs they would have got smashed.

So I hope you stand your ground.   Regarding your post. Pressing is a big component of our system yes, but not all our players are that good at it. Sturridge, whilst an impressive player, isn't that good of a presser. He's willing and will try, but isn't all that effective. Not only that, but if we require a higher level of pressing against a certain team, Lallana can take his spot out wide in a 433.   Regarding his temperament, you know I asked an AC Milan fan how the leadership was in Milan when he went there. The guy essentially said they had one real leader in Milan in Balo's time there and that was Kaka. Apart from that? Not really. Go wayyyy back to City. With the Tevez drama and the toxic City dressing room, and your looking at a guy who hasn't been around a whole lot of leaders. On our squad, we'll have a ton of leaders for him to get guidance and keep him grounded. Add in Brendan and Dr. Peters and I think he might be coming into one of the best situations for him.   Regarding developing others, I don't think we'll ignore Markovic and Sterling just for Balo, I don't think we'll be that negligible. He'll be treated like everyone else, and I'm sure Brendan has made that crystal clear for him. The biggest key is we don't really have other problem children who we also have to coddle. Balo also, for the most part, in Milan has been drama free.   On the footballing side, I think he's going really open it up for Sturridge and Sterling if he does play outwide in a 433. So for that I'm really excited. I think he'll be fine imo.

A couple of his final balls (and that assist for Chadli) were excellent, but there were still times when he got caught playing like he had more time then he had, and this led to some scruffy, overhit passes.

He showed enough to me today to get the nod against Liverpool, as much for his defensive pressing as anything, but he still needs to speed up his decision-making a bit.  That will come with games.  As it is, I'd still have some reservations about playing him away at some of the tighter grounds against teams that will give him less space than QPR (e.g. West Ham last week), but well done him anyway on his best performance to date.

Especially if even walking down the street and looking a bit too Muslim gets you odd looks. It's a crisis of identity for some Muslims. No doubt some of them will swing to the extremes.

&gt;
&gt;Shortly before the Siege of Trenzalore, she summoned the Eleventh Doctor and Clara Oswald aboard the Papal Mainframe. After explaining about the signal from the planet surface, she teleported the Doctor and Clara to the planet's surface, ordering them to return to her in ""one hour"". 
&gt;When the Doctor later discovered that Gallifrey and the Time Lords were attempting to return through the scar tissue left by the Cracks in Time, Tasha contacted the Doctor via a massive holographic projection of her face and warned him not to summon the Time Lords back, or else the Time War would begin anew. The Doctor refused to abandon Trenzalore's people.  In response, Tasha informed the Church that their new faith would be ""Silence"". She declared that the Doctor must never speak his name and that ""silence will fall.""
&gt;Three hundred years later, the Daleks – having failed to breach Trenzalore's defences on their own – attacked the Papal Mainframe and killed everyone inside, including Tasha. The knowledge of the Doctor was extracted from her corpse and used to restore the Daleks' lost memories of him. The Daleks also apparently revived, tortured, and killed her several times in a failed attempt to learn how to fully breach Trenzalore's defences. Eventually, she was converted into a Dalek puppet. The Daleks used her to draw the Doctor and Clara into a trap onboard the Papal Mainframe, under the guise of wanting to speak with him.

true,[deleted],null,null,"In terms of volume of fans, there were never this many of them to consider before. I think the phone call is important, because it also goes back to how tactful 11 was in terms of using time travel to do small, important things. It's his true last act, not the destruction of the Daleks over Trenzalore - his last act is preserving his future self's relative sanity (not traveling alone).

You do have a point, the writers do have a confidence problem. While the end of Time of the Doctor was wonderful, bringing in Karen was a clear signal that they were worried about the impact of only having Jenna there. And frankly, they were right to - because that ""raggedy man, good night"" line obliterated anything between Clara and 11.

In this case, it's both speaking to Clara and the audience - I'm gone. It's not a betrayal to like another Doctor. It's not insulting, it's not disrespectful, the entire point is that this character has been a young twenty-something and he's been an older fifty-something, and that is the nature of it all.

But there's an entire legion of *new fans* who don't all get that, necessarily. I should know that, I'm one of them. How many arguments do people get stuck in between, 9, 10 and 11 in terms of ""absolute best Doctor?"" Answer: too many. Because there shouldn't be any.

Because they're all the goddamn Doctor. And that's why he calls Clara. They were all scared going into it. They all needed help - and 12 is no different. It's new, which scares others, but it's nothing compared to stepping out of the TARDIS and grabbing the sonic, preparing to save the universe.

So take a Deep Breath. Yes, this is a not-subtle way of speaking to the audience. An audience that has probably doubled in recent years.

&gt;

&gt;The __Rani__ is a [fictional character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_character) in the British science fiction television series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. She was played by [Kate O'Mara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_O%27Mara). 

&gt;The Rani is a renegade [Time Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord),  an [evil scientific genius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain) whose villainy comes not from the usual variety of lust for [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(sociology\)) and suchlike, but from a mindset that treats everything (including [morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality)) as secondary to her research; she has been known to [enslave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery) entire planets such as Miasimia Goria in order to have a ready supply of experimental subjects and a place to carry out her experiments uninterrupted. Her major interest is in tinkering with other species' biochemistry — she was exiled from [Gallifrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallifrey) after some of her lab [mice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse), as a result of an experiment, grew to enormous size and ate the President's pet cat, and according to The Master, ""took a chunk out of him too"". A past relationship between the Rani and [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)) is hinted at [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] but was never elaborated upon, although it is established they are the same age.

&gt;The Rani was, like the [Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_(Doctor_Who\)), intended as a recurring foe of the Doctor, but only appeared in two serials, *[The Mark of the Rani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mark_of_the_Rani)* and *[Time and the Rani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_the_Rani)*, before *Doctor Who* went off the air in 1989. The Rani also appeared as the principal villain in *[Dimensions in Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensions_in_Time)*, a *Doctor Who* charity special created for [Children in Need](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_in_Need). She was intended to appear in another serial entitled *[Yellow Fever and How To Cure It](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unmade_Doctor_Who_serials_and_films#Yellow_Fever_and_How_to_Cure_It)* but the show was put on [hiatus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiatus_(television\)) and the serial was cancelled.

I know the other costs such as getting a solicitor and accountant are tax deductible too so that would make even less income taxable. 

I'm less interested in capital growth because it seems a bit speculative and unpredictable, I want nice boring reliable steady income at a decent percentage. Also why I'm looking at 1 beds, I want a young professional singleton or couple with no kids! 

Potentially I would look to overpay the mortgage to get the mortgage down from 75% to 60% of purchase price and then lock into a 5 year fix and just keep it at that rather than overpaying further to own it outright. Then after 7 years (2 year fix then 5 year fix) maybe remortgage and pull out equity to look to add another BTL.

There's nothing anti-cop about a single word of what I wrote. 

&gt; 99% of police officers in the USA don't want to kill people if they can avoid it. 

I did not claim they do. But the fact is **if** you're a criminal in the US, your odds of running into armed police are near 100%. That gives you greatly increased odds of running across that 1%, or even 0.1% that are prepared to pull a gun on them and/or have had a shitty day and is not as focused as they should be, and liable to make a mistake.

Doesn't matter if 99%, or 99.9% of them are good guys that won't pull a weapon on an unarmed person.

This gives criminals greatly increased incentives to arm themselves. Which again gives cops a greatly increased incentive to ensure they stay armed, and to consider every criminal potentially lethal. 

&gt; The majority of trials in the USA are fair and the sentence length appropriate.

Whether or not sentence lengths are ""appropriate"" is entirely subjective. From my point of view they are ridiculous. Feel free to think otherwise. But don't be surprised when criminals in the US are far more motivated to ensure they stay out of prison than elsewhere.

&gt; Also, cops don't always draw weapons in the US. They only do so when they feel threatened because the American populous is very, very armed.

And **this** was exactly the point I was making. **As a result** it is highly risky for American criminals to stay unarmed, because the chance of a *mistake*, or running into that one asshole, will get them shot, so better to be prepared to shoot first. 

The problem of course being that this makes it impossible for the police to disarm, thus perpetuating the cycle.

&gt; Please stop this anti-police/America circle jerk

I would, if I'd actually started or participated in one.

Yes, not all ideas are created equal and secularism has proved to be a better set of principles than Christianity for the governing of a nation.  

BTW - I think some form of multiculturalism is inevitable and even desirable.  What's the alternative?  It may well be easier if everyone were  white, middle class and spoke with a posh British accent, but that's not the world we live in.  Few people outside of the Telegraph's readership would agree that everyone should be coerced to conform to some idealized and probably fictional vision of what it means to be British.  

Having said that, Islam is getting to be a real problem is it not?  Secular societies are actually really good at supporting a multiculture, but just what do we do when one of those cultures is against secular principles?

No, I'm not saying that every Muslim is dangerous.  I think that the majority are completely non-threatening who are a benefit to society.

What I'm trying to say is that it doesn't matter how much we get for Borini. As you said yourself ""getting money and wages off the books is getting money and wages off the books"" 

Borini's market value itself is at 14 million right now, because that's what Sunderland are willing to pay for him, but a more reasonable figure in my opinion is somewhere around 11 million or so based on what he's done and his potential. Now how does getting an extra 3 million off Borini help us in the long run?

It doesn't. 3 million pounds is insignificant to a club of our stature these days. What I'm trying to say is that 14 million pounds isn't such a huge amount of money that we would shift off someone who has a future at the club for it. This isn't a Torres like sum of money that we just can't turn down. If Rodgers and the transfer committee see Borini's value playing for us in his career to be worth more than 14 million pounds, than they won't and shouldn't sell him.

true,wheressnoo,null,null,"just rewatched fires of pompeii and found a lot of interesting seemingly connected/foreshadowing that occurred on screen that seems to reflect this. 

i watched the episode knowing that capaldi would be the doctor, and thought about what if the capaldi is the doctor but is in 'hiding mode' and has been for a while. hence the kids. 

several conversations and situations almost mirror those in the 50th anniversary. such as Tenant saying to Donna after letting Vesuvius blow up, that if he could change things and go back he would. referring to both gallifrey and here. 

Donna helping Tenant blow up the mountain by placing her hands on the lever. just like how all of the doctors did in the 50th. 

there's also a scene at the very end after tenant saves capaldi, where capaldi's son comes in and he calls him doctor. now the interesting part to me wasn't that exchange, however it was the scarab that the wife gave capaldi. it almost looked like a pocket watch. and then the son's necklace...also looked like a pocket watch. 

So i wonder if Capaldi ends up going back in time, recruits Amy (she's a soothsayer here, could be a fun side story, if it is indeed amy, esp since they seem to give her a lot of screen time for a supposed extra before she became Amy), and puts them both into hiding using the pocket watches. there was a theory i read somewhere a while back that said maybe amy went back in time and into hiding with the doctor. lost her memories but some leaked out and she talked about the blue box. this made her interested by the Pylorians as they too know about the blue box. they recruit her and she becomes a soothsayer. 

all of this in order to get the 12th to go find gallifrey. 

when 12 realizes gallifrey is still out there, with all of the clues he left himself across time and space, he has to go into hiding, because if others like the Daleks find out, then....

this is also supposed to explain why the Doctor didnt show up in Torchwood, but Capaldi did in Miracle Day. There's a theory that here too maybe 12 was in hiding for some reason and he didnt kill himself but something else happened. 

i always love DW call backs/references to previous episodes, and rewatching them to hunt for the clues.

2. The support and respect Rodgers gave Suarez is enough for him to consider giving humility and a cool head a serious try, even if he messes up at some point.

3. The adoration of fans in the Kop would give him something he's never had.

I think that one of the things that is really wonderful about Doctor Who is the fact that it changes.  It changes more than any other show ever has, and quite often.  We lose our Doctors, and we lose our companions, but we always get new ones too.  Change is hard for a lot of people.  It's natural!  But, Doctor Who is definitely not a show for people who just can't deal with a lot of change all the time.  I enjoy it!  I like the suspense of knowing that new things will happen.

Holy shit...  I think you're onto something.  I just looked at the time line.  Not a single Moffat episode has been enjoyable for me since RTD stepped down.  I can't believe I never noticed.  But EVERY favorite Moffat episode was while RTD was still in charge.

I can't believe I never noticed.

For me, Lukaku needs direct linkup through the middle to get the most out of him. Barkley provides this, but Naismith really doesn't- for all his hard work, his vision and creativity are lacking. I wouldn't mind trying MccArthy or Besic in a more advanced playmaker role, but as it stands we need to get the most out of Naismith, so I stick with the tactics from the Arsenal game. 

Mirallas (left), Aidey (Right). Need to see more of Atsu before I put him ahead of those lads, but he might be great on the left and Kevin down't middle. 

I think Besic showed good vision and creativity preseason, and has the ability to play the great balls down the middle, wouldn't mind giving him a try.

Once the new Doctor is here it should be his hour (or 75 minutes in this case) to shine. This special message wasn't needed for the 2nd through 11th Doctors (an image lasting one second of Tennant along with all the others in ""The Eleventh Hour"" is NOT the same as this whole comforting phone conversation), why is it needed now?

If the companion is having trouble dealing with the new Doctor (something that felt like it was trying a bit too hard to allude to the fan girls in my opinion), then let that be something to develop and grow in the story. Conflict in a story is always good, as well as the characters discovering their resolution, and bonding together. Having a phone call that magically makes everything better in less than a minute is a boring and cheap cop out, in my opinion.

The fact that Clara was abandoning The Doctor in his time of need made me feel like she doesn't actually care about The Doctor, she just cared about the young (looking) man that whisked her away on adventures. This would be as if a friend got amnesia, was having trouble adjusting to the world, and you said ""I'm someone they trust in and would be good help for them, but I don't like their new personality that they can't help having, I'm gonna leave them"". No companion had even considered it before, and I feel it has made Clara a weaker character (which is a shame, because I thought her character was much more fully realized in this episode than in prior ones until that moment).

&gt;Napoleon abdicated in April 1814, ending the war of the 6th coalition.
Negotiations between Britain and the US started in August 1814.

The French Revolutionary/Napoleonic Wars had been on the go since the 1790's. There was a hell of a lot of things to sort out after almost three decades of war.

And Britain, now the most powerful force in Europe, was a key part of that. It had a lot on its plate.

There were also all the domestic problems caused by such a long war. Britain wanted a quick end to all military conflicts as the British populace were suffering from very high war exhaustion, and there were rumblings of revolt in certain parts of Britain (mainly England, the heavily industrialised areas mostly).

To say that Britain wanted the War of 1812 over, and the peace negotiations over, as quickly as possible is an understatement.

&gt;The peace treaty between the two was signed in the UK parliament in December and the US senate in February.

Due to the time it took back then to cross the Atlantic, both nations would have considered the co-signing in the UK as the official end of the war. The Senate signing the treaty in february would be pretty much a rubber stamping of something already considered passed by most.

Yes it was. That's the definition of multiculturalism. You don't try and impose your culture or way of life onto other people. You have multiple different cultures existing together side by side.

People don't come to this country to become ""Englishmen"". They come here for better work opportunities and protection under our law. You have to accept the fact that, on some instinctive level, they will wish to be close to people they feel a cultural affinity toward.

The casual racism of the 60's/70's has nothing to do with it. Some cultures are just more compatible with ours than others. We are always going to have difficulties with the Muslim community in this country in a way that we won't with Sikhs (for example).

true,tinkerbelle91,null,null,"So, I want to start by saying, I was pretty disappointed with last nights episode, and I also wasn't a massive fan of the Time of the Doctor. I also love Matt Smith, and feel like, as much as I love Capaldis other work, he didn't quite measure up somehow.
So, there is a strong possibility that my theory is mostly based on wishful thinking, but bear with me :)
I, like most whovians, jumped at the mention of the valeyard. I wasn't expecting it to be Canon, since it was an idea mentioned long ago, and the fact that the GI said ""[the doctor] would be known by many names before the end"" with regards to the Valeyard got me a little excited - it seems as though they're implying the Doctor will become the valeyard!
I know a lot of people think that it's unlikely he'll come about any time soon, as the original quote says that the Valeyard will come about sometimes between the twelfth and last incarnation, but I dont see what the point in mentioning now would be if they're going to wait a while before creating the character - I mean, Moffat must have meant to use it for his own writing, and I doubt he'll be writing for doctor who too much longer.
So, I do think they're planning a Valeyard story arc.
I felt like the Christmas special was a very poor send off for Matt, and it seemed.... Wrong somehow. Like there was something we weren't seeing. I already think it was strange that they never bothered explaining how Clara and the Doctor escaped his time stream, and I feel like I'm missing part of the story.
So I watched the Christmas one again, and it seems as though he regenerates on the roof of the building. We see it, the light, the fact that he is young again, he doesn't even warn her about a face change. It's like he expects it to be over, and then BAM! Capaldi. Like the regeration went wrong.
It could be explained away, obviously, but what if that's the ""regeneration gone wrong""? That's why Clara is noticeably upset, and that's why he forgets so much. There was a fault.
I think capaldi is actually the valeyard. He's almost the exact opposite of Matt's doctor, and he's so very angry and potentially murderous. I'm all for a darker doctor, but this guy stole a tramps clothes and lied about it.
So I was thinking that maybe, that's why 11 calls her and asks her to help the new guy. Because she's the girl that has always saved him, and he needs her again. To protect him from himself.
I think that Moffat is making such a huge effort to make people leave Matt behind because it's so obvious that capaldi is different. He needs to be accepted for such a major plot twist to work.
I think, long term, we'll see capaldi get darker, more murderous, and make some pretty horrific decisions, until it comes to a point where Clara is in danger, and then we'll see a mental struggle between the valeyard ( capaldi) and the Doctor ( Smith) culminating in the death of both and a new regeneration in the end.
I'd love to know what you guys think, I know there's a lot that could be disputed, but I think a showdown between capaldi and Matt would be awesome :p",0,1408911314,null,0,false,0,cjzcr4t,t3_2ee4u1,t1_cjzcr4t,t3_2ee4u1,null,1427378028,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

You also get 250MG of webspace, if that's the sort of thing that floats your boat, which I've been using to run a couple of websites with no problems. Moreover they have a forum, which is another good sign I always think. And they are a British company too :)

Doctor Who has never had the best audio mixing, and if you don't watch it on with clear hardware, you will have trouble.

It was a jarring distraction from just trying to enjoy the episode.

I think they might have a real problem with continuing to grow Doctor Who internationally if they can't clean Capaldi's dialogue up.

Consider this: a good husband has undergone a brain surgery that rendered him different than he had been before. Not disabled, but surely different. So different, that his wife after trying to love and stay with new-him, decides to leave. In an amazing turn of events, she finds a note from the past, in which her husband reminds her of their once love and asks her to stay with whatever may come out of him, despite all. At the level presented here, it is clearly a cheap emotional abuse of the feeling between them. Instead of leaving it up to the wife and wishing her best of everything, the husband plays on her emotions to ensure his future well being. It is understandable, as he is scared of what future holds, but still unmoral. And this is where Doctor Who takes the idea for a spin.

I like to imagine the 11th Doctor as many others do, as a adorable man, who (word games!), above all, puts others' need before his. In the end however, when facing an imminent and probably a fearsome change, crumbles a bit and makes the call (again!) to ensure that the after-transition will be that bit easier with the help of Clara. He doesn't show it, but at this point we know for sure that he is afraid. Being a man that he is though, 11th Doctor in final speech embraces the change and accepts it. It is a clear goodbye from him to a companion and a lover.

When 12th rolls around though, we know that he is, although still a Doctor, a much more darker character. The screenwriters play with the idea, leaving it up to the debate whether our hero has pushed the villain out of the pod or not. Either way, the idea of talking someone to suicide, even if to save lives, is controversial. Clara, even unaware of this ambiguity of Peter Capaldi's Doctor, decides that she do not want to take part in this man's adventures. She proves that she doesn't care for the looks, that this is a matter of this-not-being-a-man-she-fell-in-love-with. She, in a way, fulfills 11th's final speech. She remembers what the Doctor stands for, she still believes in him, but she is ready to too let go. Then the call happens, and the misstep that 11th did leads to Clara being convinced to stay.

This is interesting, as it describes the 12th's character enormously. He decides to play on Clara's emotions (and what previous Doctor did) to make her stay. He takes over as the successor of Matt Smith's hero without that gentleness that would make 11th say sorry twenty times for hurrying her up like this. 12th could have just let her live her life for a while, leave her freedom to process what she should do next. Instead he makes the decision for herself, for his good. And maybe even hers, just to watch her as she copes with a lost, but this is still up to debate as the series progresses. Either way, we are seeing the first attempts to deepen the character that the new Doctor is.",0,1408912987,null,0,false,0,cjzdil9,t3_2ee4u1,t1_cjzdil9,t3_2ee4u1,null,1427377672,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

Lucas is suffering in people's for three main reasons as far as I can see

1. He isn't Steven Gerrard but he needs to be played in a similar manner. Remember that tonking we gave Spurs away last year? Lucas played at the base of the midfield with Allen and Hendo ahead of him and he thrived, much like Gerrard he needs people ahead of him doing the running, what he lacks in Gerrard's passing ability and game control he makes up for in shielding the back four, breaking up the play and covering the fullbacks.

1. Rodgers hasn't used him correctly, can't drop Gerrard so if Lucas plays it's with Gerrard which is a fucking disaster. 

1. His stamina/movement have plummeted since his injury and this means he drops off. He had a good first half against S'hampton but as he grew tired  he couldn't cope and a)dropped too deep beside Gerrard screwing up the formation and b)made tired decisions/actions

If Gerrard gets injured what then? Can hasn't proved he can play as a single DM and is brand new to the league, Allen same but with league experience. Lucas needs to be either A) played in all games Gerrard doesn't (which could be a lot given the amount we have this year and his age or B) be used to conserve Gerrard by coming on for him regularly.

The representatives of the British people have both a constitutional right and a moral duty to do what is best for the British people. But more importantly, international law doesn't really exist as law - what we are really talking about are treaties with other countries and with the UN. But the important thing to remember is that a UN treaty only applies to the United Kingdom if the United Kingdom says that it does, so there is absolutely nothing stopping us from simply ending that particular treaty and calling it a day.

[The UN Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness](http://www.unhcr.org/3bbb286d8.html) is interesting in that it has only been signed by 60 nations. It is also debatable whether this treaty actually makes it illegal to strip someone of their citizenship for treason - as some here are claiming. As far as I am aware leaving ISIS fighters stateless wouldn't be against this convention. My evidence is Article 8 section 3.a of the convention, along with the following statement:

&gt;""[The Government of the United Kingdom declares that], in accordance with paragraph 3 (a) of Article 8 of the Convention, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 8, the United Kingdom retains the right to deprive a naturalised person of his nationality on the following grounds, being grounds existing in United Kingdom law at the present time:  that, inconsistently with his duty of loyalty to Her Britannic Majesty, the person

That was the same character.

Here, I'll lay these out real quick for you:

* Catherine Tate (Donna) appeared in The Runaway Bride and season 4, and those were the same character. The Doctor is shocked in ""Partners in Crime"" when their paths cross again.

* Freema Agyeman (Martha) appeared in the end of season 2 as one character, and season 3 as Martha; it's hinted that her character in S2 was Martha's cousin.

* Karen Gillan was a soothsayer in Fires of Pompeii, and Amy Pond; the two characters were unrelated.

* Jenna Coleman appeared in those two episodes and then in the second half of season 7. These were three different people, but were all named the same or similar and had the same personality. This is puzzled over by the Doctor while she is his companion in S7, and explained in Name of the Doctor.

* Pete Capaldi appeared in Torchwood as Frobisher, in Fires of Pompeii as Lucius something, and is now the Doctor.

For me, it's about communication while allowing people to retain some of their cultural practices **within limits** and accepting the differences; whereas you see it as an excuse for isolationism that represents some Muslim problem.

But the same thing happens when Britons move to Spain. Some of them adopt the language and culture; many others keep speaking their own language, seek out only their own kind and spend their time in incongruous British pubs, with people they wouldn't pass the time of day with back home, but they're British too so they must be alright.  
It's not exclusively Islamic. It's just human nature.

I don't want to see other cultural groups cut themselves off, but we as hosts haven't exactly encouraged them to blend in.

true,IAmNotAmerican,cnty-expat,I don't belong here,"In the first link, the guy is comparing midday (off-peak prices) when it is clear that in most cases Europe is using a flat rate. Why didn't he bother to compare short journeys, rush hour pre-booked? Very cherry picked.

With the second link, I don't think passenger numbers (the first chart) show anything but an increase in passenger numbers - nothing to measure against as to the ""success"".

The second chart showing the cost of driving doesn't explain what a 'rail yield' is so it's meaningless to me.

I can't see how GDP growth (3rd chart) has any effect on growth of rail journeys - there is not enough to compare here - why was a chart not included for car journeys or bike journeys for a better comparison? I suppose it might be an indicator as to rail becoming more affordable if the price of goods are coming down.

4th chart, plotting journey growth against other European countries again shows nothing other than journey growth being higher in the UK. Would be more useful to see it alongside other population trends such as growth of the population as a whole - which would explain this. More people leaving school and having to commute by train (e.g. into London) does not demonstrate any level of ""success"". Especially where in European countries of lower population you might get a seat, whereas in the UK you will most certainly be breathing the exhaled air of the passenger rubbing up next to you.

Does government funding mean success (5th chart)? Again, meaningless unless compared against another similar successful government project.

Passenger and workforce fatalities are one measure of success (6th chart)... and bringing down fatalities can be considered a success - but only against our own record. The European statistics (7th chart) are probably unnecessary, but since the objective of the blog is to compare with Europe, they are not useful unless you could show historical data for each European country and ascertain as to whether it is a reduction in fatalities on a whole across Europe, or if the UK is a fortunate anomaly.

Surprisingly customer satisfaction seems to have improved marginally (8th chart)... sadly once again the author has seen fit to leave out European figures... so who knows if this demonstrates the UK rail network is better than Europe?

Freight has increased a little (9th chart) but so what? Perhaps an important metric might be time spent in transit or freight lost, but again one set of data points shows nothing useful for proving either way if this is a success.

Growth in London commuters (10th chart) is another meaningless statistic unless compared against European railways - see my previous comments above for the 4th chart.

**TLDR; The links provided are either cherry picked, or do not contain enough data points to compare success of the UK rail network against Europe. In the second link this is not the authors intent to compare directly to Europe but this reduces most of the charts to showing an increase or decrease in numbers - not a measure of ""success"".**

**With the exception in reduction in passenger fatalities for the UK (which can be considered a success in any country), if you are specifically claiming your rail network is the best in Europe - then you need to provide matching charts for Europe (or individual European countries) for a meaningful comparison. An increase in passenger numbers does not mean success - unless it can be demonstrated that other countries that have had the same relative increase have not performed as adequate.**

Lastly it's disappointing that the second author did not include journey times, delay statistics, station closures or improvement works in their research - which would have been much more useful in judging the measure of success - particularly against 40 years ago and the rest of Europe.",0,1408916094,null,0,false,0,cjzexvx,t3_2eg793,t1_cjzexvx,t1_cjzcbdb,null,1427376997,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

true,nillis,null,null,"I am a student that has braces!

I had braces as a teenager but due to some issues with my orthodontists after care advice being awful (telling me to stop wearing my retainer after about 5 months) my teeth had moved. So I poked about to try and find a solution.

First I asked my dentist to refer me to a private clinic for a consultation (about £20 but this can depend). At the consultation the orthodontist went through 3 options :

[Fixed braces!] (http://www.dentalhealth.org/uploads/images/Fixed%20Braces%20(CMYK).jpg) - these cost about £3000 for top and bottom and I'd need them for about 14 months

[Invisalign!] (http://howmuchdoesinvisaligncost.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Invisalign-Cost.jpg) - these were about £4500 and would be about 14 months. Good because they were not noticeable and wouldn't be as painful as normal braces

[Incognito Braces!](http://myincognitobraces.blog.com/files/2011/03/DjrfuYS6qykxqHvCYHUglKPdmACSRkG5.jpg) these were by far the most expensive at about £8000. And a similar time scale as well.

Note these prices will vary depend a bit on who you go to.

I was really not happy with these options, they were very expensive, and were going to take a long time. I started researching other options. The main ones I found are explained very well on this website: http://www.glasgowstraightteeth.com/straight-teeth-systems/

They were all a good bit cheaper (can't remember the price but much cheaper than the first options I was given. If you look online a general price range is very easy to find) and were going to be less noticeable/ painful than the original options I was given. 

Now it is important to say that depending on how bad your teeth are these options might not work - you're best going for a consultation - and it is possible to find free ones! You just need to look.

In the end I was very lucky! A dentist at my practice had just qualified for [Quick Straight Teeth!] (http://www.quickstraightteeth.co.uk/) and was just getting them fitted herself (we actually received the same awful advice from the same orthodontist!).

She offered me the treatment, retainers, tooth filing &amp; a free course of whitening treatment for £1,200. The treatment would only take 3 months max.

I got the braces fitted at the start of June and will be getting them off at the end of the month.  I can't recommended them more - in comparison to the braces that I had about 5 years ago as a teen they were so much less painful - didn't cut up my mouth - and were very subtle. My teeth look great!

I'd really recommend looking into any of the options I discovered after the first orthodontist. However there is a limit on how bad your teeth can be before they won't be effective (looking at before/after photos though your teeth can be quite bad at first). 

You'll need to get a consultation. I'd recommend going to numerous places (I found lots of free ones) and getting ideas of prices - I wouldn't be afraid to say to a dentist you like that you can get the treatment cheaper elsewhere to see if they can lower their prices.

I got top and bottom braces. If you only want the top set I imagine you will get them cheaper (though with some treatments they insist on top and bottom). I thought  I would only need top but after talking to different dentists I realised I would need both (but at the end of the day you're the customer so if you only want top ones - and the treatment allows for it - you'll only have to get top ones).

If you have any questions about my braces that I have on right now I'm happy to answer any that I can!

The costs are shared among all of these people, but he is the main beneficiary.

People are incentivised to choose to take the inefficient option (taking a job further away, travelling when an alternative such as teleconferencing might have sufficed or making extra leisure trips). Just as new roads create new drivers, as people choose to travel further, artificially subsidised railways create their own extra passengers, except they now expect others to pick up the cost of their choices.
