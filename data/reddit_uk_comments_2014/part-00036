 - Club A: Buy Young Player, Develop Them.

 - Club A: For £10million, he is yours, he's been developing with us, a huge prospect.
 - Club B: We'll have him for £5million
 - Club A: Then he's not for sale

This happens everywhere, every single Season. These players are kept until their 20s, without a dedicated position or a club, they are not sold, only loaned, and they go from one club to another, normally a club that is associated with Club A and an enemy of Club B.

These players are sucked up, processed, and ONLY sold if the money is there for them, and if the money isn't there, they are kept on loan throughout the years with Club A hoping they develop and are eventually sold.

It's ridiculous, it destroys players, and it's why foreign players who are developed abroad WITHOUT silly contracts are bought and played over here by the other smaller clubs.

Clubs should not develop players if their only intent is greed, because sadly they would rather keep hold of these players and send them on loan for 5+ years and pay them £3k a week than sell them to a rival club for a normal price.",0,1391650897,null,0,false,0,cf85uwm,t3_1x3s3r,t1_cf85uwm,t1_cf7xros,null,1432273386,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

My son is autistic. He will only knowingly eat one vegetable, potato, because he only eats food that is one colour and it is the only one that matches that colour. His teacher knows he's autistic and he has a TA who seemed to be notably absent when all this was going on.

Ultimately, I don't care about their motivations, I care about justice. This lad doesn't seem like he's going to do a hatchet piece so I'm pleased he's keeping the disaster in the minds of whatever readership he has. I certainly don't want to be in a situation again where the whole nation is thinking, ""Are the scousers still banging on about Hillsborough? They should just let it go."" It's precisely what SYP will be hoping for.

To address your other points: I get the impression from the deadlines he's setting for contributions that the two events will be treated seperately, he's just asked for people's memories in the same blog post. 

As for survivors being on here, it seems improbable. I also visit other forums and they're all completely oblivious to /r/LiverpoolFC. The demographic is mostly teenagers and early-twenties Americans, with a smattering of Britons of a similar age. If it wasn't, ElevenReds would have got fucked off ages ago.

Finally, I hope you don't think I'm being contrary or trying to score internet points. Much as I enjoy doing that on unimportant topics, this is something I take seriously. It's clear your concerns were sincere but if we're going to get real justice for the 96 we need support from *all* football fans. We can't afford to piss off well-meaning supporters of the cause because they don't live up to some unwritten ideal. We should save our anger for those that deserve it.

The key point is this: Funded or not, ID needs to be verified by the employer before the form is submitted. This requires a meeting in person with original documentation. There are a variety of other checks the employer must perform before the form is submitted. This is irrespective of who pays the fee. 

So rule of thumb: Need a DBS check for a job? Don't send anybody any money or submit any documents unless a meeting can be performed in person.

There is the option for external verification but it is extra cost and time consuming so most employer's won't go for it as the check itself takes long enough.

One of the consequences of this is that drugs can be a quite useful transfer of currency between one place and another and the source of slush funds for any team that needs it.

true,galenwolf,eng-manchester,Manchester - FOR SCIENCE!,"Whilst I can understand the idea behind teaching kids to eat healthy expulsion is way out of line.

This whole idea that there are forbidden foods is stupid, everything should be taken in moderation.  If anything schools should be trying to introduce kids into as many foods and cuisines as possible, and teach them how to cook.  Give them the tools so that when they are adults they have the ability to turn a vast variety of ingredients into great food that is balanced.

On top of that schools should provide more means for kids to exercise out of school time, I know a few countries (like Japan) which really push kids into having after school activities which cover a huge range of subjects.

For example when I was at school you had: (boys) Football, Cricket, Rugby, Basketball and (girls) Gymnastics and Hockey. We also did swimming for like a year. The choice was limited, didn't teach kids the great variety of physical activities you could do and there was no push to get kids to do the activities.  P.E for two hours a week isn't enough.

In Japan you have (taken from various schools websites): Aikido, Karate, Golf, Kendo, Football, Gymnastics, Tennis, Basketball, Badminton, Volleyball, Sumo, Archery, Judo, Fencing, Swimming, Jukendo, Cross Country running. That's the sports, there is a cultural list as well.  You do it every day, and there is a lot of pressure from society to join a club so nearly every kid does so.

Actually speaking of Japan, how they do food is interesting. Of course these are generalities I am talking about but Japan on the whole takes their school food very seriously and is very proud of it.

 Its local, fresh and its not processed or frozen.  Kids eat in classrooms with their teacher and they eat the same meal, that way the teacher can educate the kids about what is in the meal.  Once you reach senior high school you can bring in a packed lunch (Bento) and they shit all over our packed lunches (they can take an hour to make): [Google images of Bento, most of those will be home made btw](https://www.google.co.uk/search?safe=off&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=93&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=976&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=japanese+bento+high+school&amp;oq=japanese+bento+high+school&amp;gs_l=img.3...4352.9084.0.9267.24.18.6.0.0.0.101.1167.17j1.18.0....0...1c.1.34.img..19.5.243.BDl8QYFMKaw)

I'd reduce the limits anyway but only if you know for certain that you're not going to exceed them.  Then either see if any of the existing cards do 0% balance transfers (Halifax are always trying to get me to do it). 

start paying down the debt as fast as possible, with the highest interest rate card taking the most payment. 

If you have a card with a low rate, it might be worth doing a balance transfer onto that card (if you can) 

I'm not too sure whether balance transfers between cards you already have are subject to as strict credit scoring (as you've already got the credit, you're just moving it around) so you'd need to check that first.

I'm confused.  You refer to Tenant as 10, and then talk about 9, 10 and 11 in DotD when you should be referring to them as 9, 11 and 12 under your logic.

As an aside, referring to War Doc as 9 is just confusing for newer viewers as they catch up on things that had been posted previously.  Pretty much everybody refers to War Doc as being separate and the numbering remaining in place as before he was introduced.  Moffat even said as much because he didn't want to confuse people with things that had been published previously about the Doctors.

&gt;The [Second Indochina War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Indochina_War) (aka. the Vietnam War or the American War) began in 1955 and ended in 1975 when North Vietnamese forces [captured](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Saigon) [Saigon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saigon). During this period, the war escalated from an insurgency in [South Vietnam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam) sponsored by the [North Vietnamese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam) government to direct military intervention in the south by North Vietnam, as well as the active participation of military forces of the [United States](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) and other countries. The war also spilled over into the neighbouring countries of [Cambodia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia) and [Laos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos). An exhaustive reckoning of the total casualties must include statistical information available for each theater of the war. Most of the fighting took place in the Republic of Vietnam; accordingly it suffered the most casualties.

&gt;**Liverpool F.C.** qualified for the **2005–06 UEFA Champions League** by a special dispensation from [UEFA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA). The English Premier League were allocated four teams for the 2005-6 Champions League season. EUFA allowed Liverpool to compete as champions of the [2004–05 UEFA Champions League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_UEFA_Champions_League), however not allocating an extra place. The selection of the four club's to enter the Champions League was the decision of the [English FA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association). The FA's rule was that the first four in the final English Premier League table would enter the Champions League. The FA were firm on this ruling awarding the fourth and final English place in the competition to Liverpool's [local rivals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_derby) [Everton F.C.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.), since Everton finished fourth in the [2004–05 FA Premier League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004%E2%80%9305_FA_Premier_League). Liverpool had finished fifth in the table. The public reaction to this decision prompted UEFA to make a one-off exception for Liverpool to enter the tournament as the winners of the Champions League had traditionally entered the tournament the next season to defend the title. UEFA amended the qualification criteria for the [Champions League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League) winner to enter the subsequent tournament to prevent a recurrence.

Is that for a mobile phone contract by any chance? My wife changed her name when we got married and her phone was up for renewal at roughly the same time.  Because her new name wasn't on the roll yet - Vodafone denied her a phone contract (we have a mortgage and first class credit ratings).

&gt;how am I meant to get a fairly decent credit rating without this one basic thing I'm legally not allowed to do?

Credit rating goes on far more than JUST electoral roll (although that's part of it). You could try getting one of the 'credit builder' cards (Barclaycard Initial, Vanquis, etc) - they usually give you a limit of like £150 and a 59% APR or something equally as insane. 

Just put your weekly shop on it or something, pay it off in full each month - and as soon as they start increasing your credit limit, you know your credit rating is improving. After a year or so, switch to a more normal credit card.

Will it be a good thing? Yes, I think it will be very good for the industry. Regulation will encourage and essentially 'market' the concept of P2P loans toward consumers. When the government pledged £100million to be leant out commercially through Funding Circle we saw a big increase in the number of loan applications.

For the individual lender who is already happy with the system will regulation be a good thing? Maybe, I think. It is unlikely to increase returns and could potentially reduce rates should further regulation add further overhead costs.

The area regulation could make a HUGE difference to would be allowing P2P products in ISAs. Compared to cash ISAs at 1%, maybe 2%, the rates are so much higher there is more to gain. If you already use your ISA allowance each year into full Stock-Share ISAs then again it will probably not help you but it gives you a choice.

A number of researchers have attempted to determine marijuana's LD-50 rating in test animals, without success. **Simply stated, researchers have been unable to give animals enough marijuana to induce death.**

8) At present it is estimated that marijuana's LD-50 is around 1:20,000 or 1:40,000. In layman terms this means that in order to induce death a marijuana smoker would have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as much marijuana as is contained in one marijuana cigarette. NIDA-supplied marijuana cigarettes weigh approximately .9 grams. A smoker would theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response.

Although commonly described as free, the cost of free-to-air services is met through various means:

Tax payer funding
with an enforced levy of a licence fee for transmission and production costs (i.e., the BBC) or
with a voluntary donation for local transmission and production costs (i.e., PBS)
with commercial advertising for transmission and production costs and surplus revenues returned to the government (i.e., CBC Television/Télévision de Radio-Canada in Canada, ABC/SBS in Australia and TVNZ in New Zealand)
Commercial sponsorship
Consumer products and services where part of the cost goes toward television advertising and sponsorship (in the case of Japanese television broadcasters like TV Asahi and TV Tokyo which relies on sponsorship heavily, similar to Philippine Television like ABS-CBN, TV5 and GMA)
Free-to-air is often used for international broadcasting, making it something of a video equivalent to shortwave radio.

When they know they are going to have a long case, they ask all of the jurors to fill out a form detailing any special reason why you may not be able to do it. However, you still may be selected (as the selection process is still entirely random). 

I was selected and got taken into court along with a load of other jurors (low 20s I think), and we were meant to be whittled down to 12 jurors and 3 reserves. I got called pretty early on to have to be on the case, and at that point I was able to make representations to the judge, along with what I had written on my document, to get me off the case. It is, however, entirely up to the judge on whether they believe your reasons are good enough or not.

I got off the 6 week trial as I do a lot of project work in my job and we had recently signed a big contract and work was due to start on that within the next few weeks, and I argued that I was a key member on the project team and my not being there would cause significant financial and contractual difficulties for my employer.

America has three competing programs; the Boeing Phantom Ray, the Lockheed Martin Sentinel, and the Northrop Grunman has the X-47B.

For the UK this is less about producing a specific-end capability then it is keeping development cycles moving and proving that the UK still has the capability to indigenously design aircraft (the last one we came up with on our own was the Harrier). No one can say for certain where defence aerospace will go over the next decade, although it is probable that the F35 will be the last manned fighter aircraft developed by NATO. The Taranis program therefore keeps the UK’s aerospace industry ready to respond to new developments, as the Typhoon production winds down.

Government spending plans have become “very sensitive” to changes in the behaviour and status of a group that includes bankers and business executives and owners, as well as senior public employees including some NHS doctors. 

It's a case of putting all your eggs in one basket. The balance of earnings needs to be addressed, so we don't rely on wealthy individuals who can afford to emigrate/minimise tax costs.

An increase in lower earners pay can lead to the reduction of working tax credits and housing benefits. I say that because these benefits support the rich, those that can afford to buy rental property and employers who can minimise wage bills.

It also could have the knock on effect of reducing the influence of some special interest groups as the govt. isn't so reliant on their money.

I say the system is buggered. People are sold on the idea of land and house ownership, and that's simply not true. At no point do you own anything. It's all to the government. Try not paying your taxes on your fully paid home, and see what they do; they take it away.

My point is everyone should put into a pot, and then an organization builds good, cheap houses for everyone to live in, and we all pay a monthly fee. Like water, or electricity, etc. Since the houses would be owned and operated by a specific agent that would make for controlling prices easy.

NIDA-supplied marijuana cigarettes weigh approximately .9 grams. A smoker would theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response.

He uses co-incidence far too much (the conenction between freud and his nephew was fairly tenuous, Raynd and greenspan, etc) for my liking too.  Frankly the way he muddies psychoanalysis with corporate marketing is pretty off to me.

Basically his documentaries seem to assume that the modern world is entirely shaped by the philosophies by a handful of people, and that larger socioeconomic forces aren't nearly as important.  Frankly, the amount of credence he gives Ayn Rand in AWOBMOLG is ridiculous, for example.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt;  Jeremy Browne, a Liberal Democrat, said there needs to be a national debate about whether the state should step in to protect young women from having the veil “imposed” on them. 

&gt; Mr Browne said he is “instinctively uneasy” about banning behaviour, but suggested the measure may still be necessary to ensure freedom of choice for girls in Muslim communities. 

He seems to be arguing too different points here. The first one, which I agree with, is that people shouldn't have a certain style of dress imposed upon them. The second is that we should ban one style of dress to achieve this. However, I don't think the two are synonymous. 

Do you think that if a husband forces his wife to wear a veil, after they banned the veil, he would be fine with her walking around in public with her face showing? No, if anything he would force her to stay inside so that no-one could see her face. We need to be looking at the culture and ideology around why women wear a veil, or why their husbands feel the need to enforce that. It just seems like outright banning the veil in public places is a short-sighted and reactionary suggestion, rather than a solution getting to the root of the problem.  

I believe this is what Jeremy Browne is getting at in his comments further down the article, but the headline (probably intentionally) doesn't reflect that.

&gt;  Bob Neill, a vice-chairman of the Conservative Party, backed Mr Browne’s call for a national debate about a ban. “I do think we need to have a serious conversation about it,” he said.

&gt; He said that schools should be able to ban children who persist in covering their faces in lessons. 

What the hell would this achieve, Mr Neill? Why do you think a child wears a veil? By choice? No, it's because that's what their parents have brought them up to do, and further secluding them from interaction won't help anyone, apart from perhaps xenophobes and people who think that if a problem is hidden it goes away.

This article mentions plastic bags comprise only [0.03% of marine litter](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/sep/20/plastic-bags-symbol-waste-recycling).

I already recycle my plastic bags, by reusing them to hold rubbish. Buying a roll of bin liners because they will be cheaper over the long run than paying a tax per bag seems perverse.

It doesn't say that overall speeds everywhere were reduced, I don't know why you want it to. It's not talking about these new stealth cameras, the intention of which is to reduce overall speeding on motorways. The rationale behind this is based on evidence like [this study](https://www.toi.no/getfile.php/Publikasjoner/T%C3%98I%20rapporter/2004/740-2004/740-2004.pdf) (which is what the Guardian article I linked to earlier is about) which shows that higher speeds lead to increased accidents- ""a 10 percent reduction in the 
mean speed of traffic will result in a 37.8 reduction of the number of fatalities"". The logic behind making them hidden is that people will slow down for the whole motorway rather than just when they see the cameras, for the same reason they slow down when they see a yellow one- fear of getting caught/fined/points on licence.

While its not fair to put the blame just on him, im just a bit sick of us always just missing out on this or that player because we couldn't agree on this and that.

To be honest, I think it will be a tough game. I personally feel Spurs are  very similar to us at the moment. Maybe not in style of play, but both teams create so many chances and both teams fail to take them about 90% of the time. So it will be end to end stuff the entire match and will probably finish 1-0.

* Fresh out of uni., don't jump directly into jobs unless:

&gt; a) You were selected by your uni. placement 

&gt; b) You are sure that you can do the job without prior experience and the company is willing to hire inexperienced candidates (which is highly unlikely)

&gt; c) the company you are about to apply has worldwide presence or/and in Forbes list.

----

* Start out a part time job to keep the cash flow steady until you can find the job you studied hard for.

----

* While Unemployed: 

&gt; a) learn new advancements in your field (e.g: can learn new languages, Read research papers useful for jobs ?)

&gt; b) Keep an eye on your budget and estimate your bills a week before and stick to those estimations to avoid overspending.

&gt; c) Never pay for anything which isn't necessary. Skip going out and switch to basic supermarket food if necessary (yes, live like a student again).

----

* When applying for beginners role or junior / assistant position:

&gt; a) Always seek out opportunities which pay you right from the start, rather than the ones which offer you a ""job"" but pays you after probationary period / unpaid-intern-ship.

&gt; b)  prepare your CV so as its easy for the recruiter/HR/Interviewer to understand you just by having a glance.

i) Have an introduction section where you write a line about you, another about what you want to do.

ii) Have a paragraph explaining your skill set and what makes you special that the interviewer should hire you.

iii) Have a section about your previous jobs (If you are applying for a professional [white collar] job, and you worked as a part time in supermarket/delivery/restaurant/etc.. skip writing about those) with your headings of position held, time period, project name (if any), company name. write a small paragraph about what you did in the project and its best to mention your tasks /activities in a list below it.

iv) End the CV with a mini biography and references.

v) The key point is that you should drop keywords in your CV which would be catch the attention of the people reading the CV (e.g.: for a programmer, keywords such as Agile, Java Script, SVN, GIT, WCF, EJB, Umbraco, Magento, etc.. and for business guys, keywords such as Client Relations, Business Development, etc.). Read more here: http://www.jobsite.co.uk/worklife/how-to-use-keywords-cv-7317/

----

* When you receive calls from recruitment agencies or HR:

&gt; a) Clearly ask them the position, the work, the location and the salary for the position being discussed. 

&gt; b) Ask them to drop an email about the job description, so you can read it at your leisure.

&gt; c) Don't hastily agree to set up the interview. Take your time so you could read the job description, and to prepare. So, ask the guy/woman to call back later in the evening or next day or take his/her number so you could call him/her back (This doesn't usually work, but I recommend it; I've agreed for next day interviews which I fucked up because I didn't know what exactly they needed from a guy like me).

&gt; d) If the agencies ask you to drop by at the office, do so. But make sure that you are not spending too much on travel (if you are in a tight budget). There's nothing wrong in visiting their office and getting acquainted with their employees. One of them may find your dream job for you.

&gt; e) If you are at the recruitment agency office (if the company follows proper procedure) You'll be asked to fill in some forms asking your details and explaining your skill set. Do not fill in any confidential information (except for your house address, email and telephone number). If the company feels dodgy to you, you can just leave. no questions asked.

&gt; f) If the company requires you to pay money for CRB and ask you to provide bank statements then You should avoid those companies. I mean, why would anyone pay money to make money? This isn't a business. Its your future. (I don't even). Don't even spend a single penny on any company which promises you a job. It's not worth it (say if you spent x amount to join one, and another person spent x-5% amount to join the same company for same post and for same salary, who's to lose?). Even if you think of it as a one time investment, its wrong. Paying these companies will only encourage them to seek more people into paying them. Even if they don't actually have the post available.

&gt; e) And as for the documents you can provide a legit company your P45, council tax, work permit, utility bill, in-lieu of bank documents. for a complete list check this: https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/documents-the-applicant-must-provide-

----

* On the day before / of the interview:


&gt; a) Make sure you prepare yourself as best as you can. Refer to videos on Youtube for interview questions on your field, or find blogs/posts by Google-ing which may be relevant to your field. Be prepared even if its not 100% perfect at least aim for 60% perfectness.

 &gt; b) Make a mental note of the location of the interview and the person you are supposed to meet. If possible print out the confirmation letter or note it down on a piece of paper and stick it in your wallet/purse (just in case your phone battery dies)

&gt; c) try to find out fastest and shortest route to the interview location from nearest public transport using Google Maps.

&gt; d) Always plan ahead of your journey and try to be at least 45 mins before your prior agreed time. If you are there that early, relax, have a coffee if possible and run a few scenarios about the interview.

&gt; e) Greet the interviewer with a smile (not a creepy one, a subtle one) and firm handshake. Assure that you are comfortable and ready to grab this job. Don't feel shy to ask for water or to go to the loo. Excuse yourself before you leave.

&gt; f) Have Confidence in your speech and presentation manner, Pride in your previous accomplishments and degree earned, Apologetic if you don't know anything they ask you. Think of it as that Interview is a chance to talk with a person who you've never met before and will never talk in your life again. Worst case, you won't get the job, so what? you will never see that person again. Even if you get hired 5 years later in the same company, there is a 50% chance that you won't see him/her. Best case, you get the job, and an awesome impression on the person. You've impressed him/her pretty well and gained more respect. On a similar note, do be over confident and too proud to look down on others. Its natural to be shy and/or scared.

&gt; g) The interviewer is expected to explain you clearly about the company, the project and the work you are supposed to be hired for. At the end of the interview, Ask the interviewer questions. IDK whatever, ask the same things which he/she told you. Ask about benefits for joining the company, ask about the project team size, and ask about the project itself. (for some people this would give them the impression that you are interested) and At the end of the interview, if they decide to go for another round, rinse and repeat. Else ask the interviewer how did you do, What does he/she think of him after this interview, what does he/she feel was lacking in you or is strongest point about you. Taking feedback with these questions would make your life easier as you could cover your weaknesses and sharpen your strengths.

that's it.

&gt;The tour will include huge new regeneration projects at the Elephant &amp; Castle and Camberwell, dangerous new junctions at Tower Bridge Road, Elephant and Southampton Way and a new housing development blocking permanently the Mayor’s Cycling Superhighway near the Oval.

I have honestly no idea why they are charging you £55. It may be the case that they're charging for envelope &amp; postage or extra checks of some kind. Although really you should be just paying the price of the check. 

Alternatively if it is neither of these, dare I suggest, there is a nice little bit of profiteering going on by whoever is in charge of the DBS checks at your University. I would put in some polite enquiries and find out where that extra £11 is going.

**Types of criminal records check**

There are 3 types of check. The employer or organisation running the check should provide the applicant with more information about the level of check required.

Criminal record check applicants must be 16 or over.

**Standard - £26**

This will check for spent and unspent convictions, cautions, reprimands and final warnings, and will take about 2 weeks.

**Enhanced - £44**

This includes the same as the standard check plus any additional information held by local police that’s reasonably considered relevant to the workforce being applied for (adult, child or ‘other’ workforce). It takes about 4 weeks.

‘Other’ workforce means those who don’t work with children or adults specifically, but potentially both, eg taxi drivers. In this case, the police will only release information that’s relevant to the post being applied for.

**Enhanced with list checks - £44**

true,mythoughtsonthis,null,null,"I thought I replied to this, but guess it didn't save.  I guess I just have to disagree with your assessment.  The conflicts in her story are only during the time of the murders because that's the time period that the police told her they had evidence contradicting her memory.  She'd had four days of interviews prior to this night where her story was the same.

Now the police said Sollecito claimed she *wasn't* with him and they had evidence she was at the apartment.  These conflicted with her memories and previous statements.  The police presented these ""facts"" to her and her response was her memory is different, but if it's a fact she wasn't with Sollecito, then there must be something wrong with her memory.  Her actual TWO confessions are full of these ""I thinks, maybes, I dreamed this, I'm not sure or other such phrases"" as well.  If told what you remember is false and there is evidence to prove it, what would your reaction be?  You obviously see something nefarious; I see confusion.  

So I try to look at it from both perspectives: for me to believe that she is guilty and therefore trying to manipulate the police in this scenario requires a level of understanding her situation.  She's trying to ""play"" the police by deliberately giving them false information.  What's her goal then?  If she were guilty, she'd know the misinformation would fall apart easily because she knew Lumumba was actually innocent and not anywhere near the scene of the crime.  If she was trying to ""play dumb"" or just pretend ""confused"", then it requires a level of sophistication and awareness of what's she's doing.  But the police ended up putting her in jail after the two signed confessions.

&gt;What of the women who falsely accused him? Especially the 5th, who 'told the court she had ""no actual memory"" of the episode.' Im gonna go out and guess their faces aren't going to be put on the front of the papers.

&gt;It doesn't seem right to me that there are absolutely no legal repercussions for the people who have brought these spurious claims against Mr Roache. They're not even named and shamed.

&gt;Sorry but after a verdict of innocent has been given then the complainant should lose all rights to anonymity.

Naming and shaming, introducing legal repercussions or withdrawing/denying the right to (alleged) victim anonymity is a regressive step to an already failing conviction rate. 

Innocent people have been falsely convicted, as such it's reasonable to suggest the guilty walk free. How would you feel, as a genuine victim, if faced with your identity being made public **ontop** of the rapist being found not guilty? This would greatly deter anyone from making a complaint to the police.

Anonymity to all parties should be the law, which I argue is to blame. The media are acting in the legal parameters. The morality surrounding naming and creating a poisonous campaign against the accused has little impact of whether it's legal or not.

Parliament should legislate to introduce anonymity to the accused and alleged victims, however Cameron has already ruled this out.

It's also worth pointing out that a LD50 dose doesn't = certain death, which many seem to believe it does.
It's the median dose needed to kill 50% of a population.

LD50 doesn't tell the whole story either. It is possible to die from poisoning of things with lower LD50 than THC has. Paracetamol for example, LCt50 would be a better measure. Even then, the chances of death from cannabis are extremely slim.

It's also worth pointing out that the LD50 is for pure THC, not cannabis.

I guess the counter argument is that we see benefits from Europe as a whole because of the payments to other countries as well (eg Lithuania gets a €1bn surplus, but them being richer benefits the UK by allowing them better trade with us, more skilled workers to help us with our jobs and better quality goods up and down the supply chain).",0,1391696164,null,0,false,0,cf8ia8i,t3_1x65cp,t1_cf8ia8i,t1_cf8hgwi,null,1432279306,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The pressure a Muslim girl might feel to wear clothing approved by a parent is possibly no different from that which a boy of strongly-Christian parents feels not to be gay (assuming he is gay).  There is no convenient way of outlawing the Christian parent's behaviour though, since it doesn't equate to a something you can see in public.

My argument is that we shouldn't even try.  Familiy pressures can be good, and they can be bad, dependent entirely on your point of view.  We're perfectly entitled to our opinions on which is which, but no one should ever get their opinions codified in law.  Even more so when we consider the law of unintended consequences: what if such a law made things worse, not better?

You're trial is ran in complete secrecy (the media can't reveal if a professor of such-and-such is a hack that faked his way to the top of forensics or something because they don't know). 

And after your acquittal or conviction the media are allowed to report on it. 

We have public trials and they're incredibly important because they allow everyone in the UK to determine the fairness of a trial and allow British people to make up their own minds. The founding fathers of the US saw public trials (rightly) as a stop to state tyrranny. 

Interestingly also, a public trial  -[ is enshrined in the European Commision of Human Rights - again, rightly so.](http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/human-rights/what-are-human-rights/the-human-rights-act/right-to-a-fair-trial/)

I think that it may be that I'm one of life’s natural fence sitters.  But I would also apply the same phrase to my opinion on Gay Marriage as well.  Now maybe I’m out of step here but my support for Gay marriage is not because I feel that a Gay lifestyle choice is correct, but it is a choice for some and I do not countenance discrimination of the basis of a person’s sexual orientation.    

I can reuse my statement “ I do respect and tolerate this kind of viewpoint (although not understand them).”  And apply it to my thoughts on Gay life.  In this case I use the word respect without any element of condescension.  


Secular.

A direct outcome of living in Northern Ireland for so long is that I’m wholly against Church being responsible for running any of our institutions.  In another thread somewhere I’ve mentioned that I believe many of the problems we have had in the past are inspired by our highly segregated education system.  My thoughts on Licensing and Officiating in “Official” Marriage stem from my belief that we need a Secular society where Church has no role outside of ministering to their respective flocks’ religious need.    

I would like to see a Secular Ireland (North and South).  While I “respect and tolerate” religious views, I must admit that respect is used in this case, only as a politeness.

This was also a good read re our loanees. I had no idea Wisdom was not on a season long loan and could've been recalled. With Johnson struggling, Flanno injured and Kelly a shadow of his former self why the hell didn't we bring Wisdom back?? He's been playing very well for Derby and could've been very useful. He could've even filled in for Toure at CB in the odd game. Kolo playing 90mins 3 times in a week was asking for trouble. He went to pieces v W.Brom after his lapse.

Wisdom, Suso and Borini should all be back to fight for their places next year. I've seen nothing of McLaughlin. With Johnson, Wisdom and Flanagan all ahead of him he'd probably be best served going on loan again next season. Kelly, Robinson and Assaidi can all go IMO.

Assaidi has done well for Stoke but we can do better. Bringing in someone like Kono would be wiser. If Moses plays well for the rest of the season i'd try and make his move permanent. If he regresses again then let him go back to Chelsea.

Borini will be a crucial backup striker next year. He can be rotated in every so often, especially for Cup matches. He'll also be a great sub to bring on with 25mins to go as he'll chase and harass tiring defenders til the final whistle blows. I'm optimistic about his future.

Suso and Coutinho can slug it out for the #10 shirt. Both are young and very talented. Competing with one another should bring out the best in them both next season.",0,1391702364,null,0,false,0,cf8khzv,t3_1x6bny,t1_cf8khzv,t3_1x6bny,null,1432280418,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

So yes, in this case was always very unlikely to result in a conviction, and probably wouldn't have got to court in a different era.

Now, for the opposite case you have the same problem.  You can't prove that the complainants weren't raped - maybe they were, but it was someone else, and they're confusing their real attacker with Roache?  It's not automatically a malicious accusation.

The fact that the police and prosecutors took those claims and ran with them means the accusers will never be prosecuted.  They don't want to put off others from helping build other cases in the future.

I also have a cash ISA on crap rates just as my reserve 'proverbial hits fan' instant access. I recently cashed out about £3000 from ZOPA and while not terribly well explained in real time I did get an email saying my money was ready about an hour later. After this the money can be withdrawn and should arrive same day into your bank account but with many caveats. In practice I would suggest ZOPA has a 3 day notice and more over holidays.

Funding Circle has a full secondary market where loan parts can be traded with premiums of between 3% and minus 3%. This is a very interesting secondary income stream for advanced users but makes cashing out a lot less predictable. Currently the rates on new loans is at pretty much an all time high, if you try and sell loans from 6 months ago you will struggle. (Neutral priced loans are purchased by the auto-bidder so should still sell.)
In practice you can sell most loan parts within a day at 'neutral' value in current conditions.

I would be more understanding of this policy if the two people who seem guaranteed playtime ahead of him have amassed more than exactly two goals. 

It's not like we have fucking Bale throwing in 15 goals sitting in front of him; we have one player who has never produced any significant quantity of goals or even assists in his entire career and another young player who is half as talented. 

Lamela will  be one of those players who leaves in a year and becomes world class for another team while our fans try to explain why it's not our club's fault. 

Or he'll be another Levy victim and he'll rot on our bench or on loan for his  contract and never reach his potential while we wait for a team to bid high enough. 

Look at our recent history with buying young players. Bale and Modric are   success stories amidst at least an equal amount of failures. At some point we have to accept that maybe we fuck it up pretty frequently and that it's not always the fault of the players. 

Modric and Bale got games early and often , by the way. And they were less polished talents than Erik is. 

It's so depressing to think of where Lamela might be if he had been given a big run of games. He would have struggled at times but he also would probably have more than the two goals and one assist that Lennon and Townsend have combined. Shit, he already has one assist which won us a fucking match. 

I love Lennon, but he is a dead end player who is never going to get any better. There is a place for him at the club but it should not be in the starting lineup every damn match.

The clubs which produce good players have something in common : they play young talent and they stick with them through the inevitable struggles. If the talent is in there, it will come through eventually.

I don't think it was in the first place. Was it?

My understanding of the situation:

1. Government bod has 'run-in' (however minor) with the police.      
2. Someone (a lying policeman, we later find out) reports that gmentbod said ""...fucking plebs..."" or similar.     
3. Police log records and interaction of similar events.     
4. Media shit storm, as per.      
5. Gmentbod goes to see top coppers and has a conversation.       
6. Top coppers mis-report what occurred at the conversation (we find out later).     
7. Gmentbod resigns or is kicked out, somewhere along the line.      
8. Things turn up that imply people (coppers) are lying.      
9. Investigation as to whether or not coppers were lying.
10. We find out coppers were lying.

You're confusing the media-wankathon over the ""pleb"" with the resulting events. Also I'm not sure we can assume that people really gave a shit - it was mainly the media telling us that we did.

Elsewhere I posted an article which [discusses the uncertainties](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2009/10/how_often_do_women_falsely_cry_rape.html).  And as I said - nobody knows what the true rate of false accusations is.  It's not an easy statistic to even approximately estimate.

&gt;Why do you think there will suddenly be a good deal of false-rape allegations?

Because of the current moral panic over 'rape-culture' despite a complete lack of evidence to show that there's any worsening in the rape statistics.  Because some feminists are going the extra mile to lower the bar for what constitutes rape - telling women that if they engage in drunken sex, that they've been raped.  Because these same feminists are now conflating and confusing raunchy pop music with invitations to rape.

Moral panics are a real thing.  This case is evidence of that.

Does it not bother you that in this case, Kercher's British friends police interview were recorded, but they did not for Knox?  The police actually wire-tapped and had Knox under surveillance days before her confession and the reason the prosecutor says that her confession interrogation was not recorded was because of ""budget reasons?""

Well we could start with: if someone reports a rape, do you think they are more likely to be lying than not? 

&gt; Because of the current moral panic over 'rape-culture'

I don't think you quite understand what 'rape-culture' describes. You go on to talk about various aspects, but you seem to be making a strange connection between the objectification of women/the normalisation of what some people think is sexually aggressive language, and people reporting sexual assault. You must no how rare it is, relatively, for people to come forward when they've been attacked? And then how much rarer a successful conviction is.

&gt; conflating and confusing raunchy pop music with invitations to rape

Are you sure?

&gt; This very case is evidence of that.

Is it? A number of independent people come forward with similar stories, afaik. Granted the court has found Roache not-guilty, but that's why we have courts - to weigh up evidence that the CPS has deemed might give the possibility of a conviction. Lots of separate people came forward over Savile, and I distrinctly remember people back in the winter of 2012 saying how bad it was that Savile can't defend himself against them - they might be false and we'd never know! But in response to all the allegations that have been made by all the different people, do you find yourself believing him to be a rapist/peadophile/sexual-assualtist, not believing it, or neutral on the matter? I'm happy to stake a large amount of money on him being guilty of most of the alleged crimes, and many more besides.

That would be why the CPS went ahead: more than one allegation and weighing the case, they thought there's a chance for conviction. How or why is that part of the moral panic?

I'd be interested to see your response if Harris/DLT or any other ex-celeb type is found guilty of anything in the near future. Would it be a symptom of the moral panic or were they actually guilty, in your view?

&gt; telling women that if they engage in drunken sex, that they've been raped

[Are you sure it isn't more the case that women (people - I know a guy who was raped by a woman, even though UK law doesn't currently recognise that women can rape men) are being told that if they were too drunk to consent then they were raped?](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-17791881) The alternative, historic, alternative is ""You were drunk so who knows?"". More likely though isn't it usually followed by: ""You probably regret it"" or ""You shouldn't have got that drunk""? I'm not sure what other response there could be that doesn't go down that road.

A recent news story gave info, iirc, that the police don't do anything about 1/3 of rape reports in the UK. If you think we're in the middle of a moral panic, that would imply that a normal state of affairs would result in the majority of cases going un-investigated?

It's a somewhat odd state to be in to apparently be more concerned that the fractional number of false allegations might increase slightly, while the balance is still so far skewed in the other direction.

&gt;I'd be interested to see your response if Harris/DLT or any other ex-celeb type is found guilty of anything in the near future. Would it be a symptom of the moral panic or were they actually guilty, in your view?

No.  Again, maybe you have me confused with an extremist.

No.  Maybe you're confusing me with an extremist.

I think I see the pattern here.

So, you've proven your point on multiple occasions, in what feels like every Torres thread I've ever bothered to visit. It's very clear where you stand on this issue.


Now, let me ask you the question I've wanted to ask you for a while. I mean, you *obviously* know that Eto'o is better because you're just that much smarter than everyone else. You must especially be more intelligent than Jose because that idiot selects Fernando on a consistent basis. That was sarcasm, just so you know. So sorry, I strayed from my line of thought. The question is: Why do you think Jose chooses Torres if he's so obviously bad like you claim him to be? If Torres was *that* bad, wouldn't Jose let him rot on the bench? I mean, come on, we have two capable strikers sitting behind him, why even bother with Torres? Or, could it possibly be that Jose sees something more dynamic in Torres than he does in the other strikers?


Anyway, I'll let you ponder over this for a good while. I have no doubt you'll come back with something that will be world-shattering and change my point-of-view. Have fun!

**[Public Finance](http://www.publicfinance.co.uk/news/2014/02/cross-party-budget-deal-ends-bedroom-tax-in-scotland/)**
&gt;The deal reached between Labour and the Scottish Government now allows the extra money to be channelled into hardship funds provided through councils, housing associations and other social landlords, if approval is not forthcoming.

This will ensure that no-one in arrears because of the cut faces eviction. As a result of the deal, Labour voted in support of Swinney’s Budget at the final reading of the Budget Bill in the Scottish Parliament yesterday.

**[The Scotsman](http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/snp-and-labour-deal-ends-bedroom-tax-in-scotland-1-3294757)**

&gt;The Scottish Government’s annual Budget was passed with £35 million set aside to fully mitigate against the impact of the welfare reform which affects almost 80,000 Scottish households. It means no Scot can now face eviction from their home over the “tax”, which sees cuts in housing benefits for those considered to have a spare bedroom.

* Murrayfield International Rugby stadium
* Beautiful affordable Olympic pool, and pools all over the city
* Free and well maintained running paths

*Outdoor*

* Great network of cycle paths all around the city and the Forth
* The Forth Rail bridge, a piece of engineering history, and Scotland's ""Eiffel Tower""
* Pentland hills, miles upon miles of beautiful open country to walk, cycle or camp in free of charge. Ever see a wild deer? You will here.
* The Union Canal - take a boat out, or cycle along a good quality path for as far as you can manage
* Diving shop near Fountainbridge. Learn to scuba dive!


*Arts* 

* Internationally famous comedy club The Stand - Frankie Boyle is performing there every week these days, as well as other comedians of various degrees of funny
* Lots of cinemas, big and small, and Cineworld does unlimited passes if you just have to see everything. There are often special events on during the year especially in the arthouse cinema.
* Lots of small museums that will have unique things about them.


*Nightlife*

* Lots of pubs, clubs and restaurants
* Blackford Hill observatory. Support the sciences!

*History*

* A beautiful city, built on top of an older city, build around a castle, built on a volcano. Amazing.
* Air museum where you can take a gawk at the concorde and other great planes of history
* Every street corner in old town, and underground

That's just the obvious stuff off the top of my head that I've done myself. Other people with different interests could probably think of more. There are other things to see, unique things that you only learn about when you take a more active interest in the city.

This is pure speculation, but I wouldn't be surprised if people in the PR/whatever departments at the club would have been reluctant to go to Moyes with suggestions of things to do with the players beyond the standard signing sessions and the token yearly visit to Alder Hey at Christmas. Compare that to things that are being done now, under Martinez, like sending a camera crew on the U21s pre-season tour to film things like crossbar challenges, or the Blueseye videos that are being put up on the Youtube page. I think there's more of a willingness to do stuff like that now, and that it's a by-product of what seems to be a more relaxed, confident air around the club which has come from a change in philosophy. 

Alan Myers has probably got a lot to do with it as well.

&gt; Someone who challenges the accuracy of feminist rape statistics

Do you know what feminism, in general and to the majority of those who call themselves feminists, stands for? Not what you think it stands for, but rather how the majority of the community describe themselves?

Have you considered this by the way: You state/cite that it is impossible to know how many accusations are false accusations, but are willing to put some time and effort (more than a little it seems? Not that there is anything wrong with being informed or otherwise) into worrying as to how false accusations might increase. What kind of increase: 100%? But we don't know how many false accuations there really are: a 100% increase could be from 2 to 4 for every real 100 rapes. On that front we meanwhile (that is *we* - not ['feminists'](http://www.harkavagrant.com/?id=341)) have statistics regarding rape reporting, charges and convictions together along with statistics regarding false rape accusations (i.e. those accused of accusing falsely), charges and convictions.

Do you know the ratios of those two? I'll be clearer: the issues with the former far outweighs the issues with the latter. I'm not even sure if men are more likely to be raped than be accused of rape falsely (or correctly): do you happen to know? I imagine that men are more likely to be raped - but that's just a hunch.

&gt;&gt; I think I see the pattern here... It's the 'either you're with us or against us' mentality I guess.

Ironically, I think it's more like you *want* to see a pattern. I find myself pigeon-holed by someone I haven't pigeon-holed who thinks I've pigeon-holed him. This could go on indefinitely.

ENIC is partially to blame because of the reasons stated in the article. Lack of investment, selling key players, keeping profits, screwing over fans - essentially, they've turned the club into a business, generating them profit, whereas other clubs (you mentioned FC Basel) that are owned by supporters trusts and the like tend to be managed better.

I have no answer for why Jose sticks with Torres.  My wild speculation is that we are stuck with him unlike the other two, so he plays him to keep him happy and not demoralized, but that's a bit cynical.  It probably is because he is faster than the other two, so yes he's more dynamic in that sense.  And the alternative have not been great.

And this started with a relatively innocuous comment containing my opinion.  I was downvoted for it per usual, someone replied in disagreement, and I per usual replied cogently.  It seems strange to me that people that think Torres doesn't suck are allowed to say that ad infinitum because it appeals to the majority, but I'm not because it doesn't.

I personally think Jose keeps him on because his pace is still above and beyond our other strikers, and having someone that quick on a counter can be devastating. You could look to the goal against Bayern to see a little of what I'm trying to say. 


I also think, as ridiculous as it sound, Torres works harder on the defensive side of the ball. As much as I love how Eto'o sneaks around their box, I think Jose would rather have someone who gets back and help defensively on a more consistent basis. 

It is stupid that you can't air your opinion without being down-voted, it really kills the discussion. You know I respect your opinion, that's the only reason I give you as much shit as I do. Sometimes whenever you're not in a Torres thread I think about doing a summoning dance just so I can get you in there to make shit interesting.

Anyway, that's just my take on the Torres situation. I'm sure you have something to add to the mix.

Geddit? If a question is phrased: ""Do you think A or B?"" then most folk won't go with ""No"" as being their most helpful or obvious answer. A or B is more the sort of expected response. I'm sorry you're so misunderstood, but you're not exactly helping matters. 

&gt; Is there a way you can twist even those words? 

Why do I want to twist them? I wasn't aware that I'd even done something like that in the first place. I have no reason or intention to. Again, and entirely on your part, [projection.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection) I wonder if you realise that all these attributes you think I have are just that: what you *think*. I've asked you many questions, allowing you to expand and/or explain your position. You've responded with lots of statements about what I apparently think, and what my motivations are. Never expanding on your opinion. Why is that?

To business: So folk found guilty *are* really guilty and not just victims of a moral panic. OK and fine. But you seem to be thinking that these crimes coming to court are the result of that moral panic in the first place and took the not-guilty here, with a couple of selected aspects of alleged victims' stories (hey look at that - I said ""alleged victims""... kind of like I'm being weirdly sort of fair and neutral in all this... how can it be...), as evidence for it. 

Don't forget ""not guilty"" *doesn't* mean ""accusers were lying"". How many people have been found not-guilty but did actually commit the crime (whether or not we find out)? More than none. If we approach such cases by focussing on the accusers and the false-allegation side of things then, particularly in the case of sexual assault and rape, it's going to result in fewer people coming forward. This has been documented already afaik.

They completely capitulate to this really ugly groupthink,” Greenwald replied.

“They ride in packs and love to invoke left-liberal principles in order to justify whatever it is the state is doing. I mean they are incredibly authoritarian in this ugly way, which you usually don’t associate with people who identify themselves as on the left or whatever. It’s this Tony Blair kind of thing.”

It sounded like the experience of working with the UK-based Guardian had been a baptism of fire. I suggested that British pusillanimity, of the kind he had just decried, may be a learned behaviour, reflecting culturally instilled patterns of obeisance to power that become normalised in the workplace and ritually defended on a false intellectual basis. I also mention the effect of Britain’s scandalous libel laws – and the fact that the UK’s two left-leaning dailies are making a loss every year (compared with the repulsive Daily Mail, who turn a profit printing poison.)

“There’s this complete fear that infuses the British media,” Greenwald responded, hitting the nail on the head without much thought. “I think a part of it is financial, for the reasons you said. It’s so easy to be sued, and there’s no free press protection. But there’s very much this sense of erring on the side of extreme caution, and then it’s dressed up as journalistic ethics or whatever, because nobody likes to think of themselves, especially journalists, as being driven by fear.""

It's very cheap and you get what you pay for. It's right next to 24 Asda, which is convenient, and a 24hour garage too, which is more convenient. It's about a half hour walk to the city centre, give or take, and regular buses going into town, the occasional up the UKC (st Stephen's Hill at least) and lots of bus stops. There's also a post office about half way up, and several take aways. For a student and for temporary accommodation, it's okay. 

But it's also kind of horrible. The houses feel cheap and nearly falling apart. The main road is ALWAYS FUCKING BUSY, the noise of traffic will be your lullaby and your alarm. It's not a nice place to live. My friend's bike got stolen there, and another friend's car got broken into for the radio. Everyone who lives there looks kind of sad or ruthless and if you're prone to feelings of depression it's not likely to help. 

I wouldn't ever live there again, but it was far better than being homeless as it was all I could afford, and you'll almost certainly benefit from the extra income you'll likely save on rent. You'll also get fit if you walk into town all the time. 

You'll probably want to check the stagecoach website for buses. The 8 and 6 run minutely practically, with a few others thrown in. It's cheap but not unlivable.

There are hundreds of things to specialise in when it comes to computers, and every specialist has a different area. For example, there are people who specialise in semiconductor design of the silicon chip, logical design of the processor, motherboard design, designing compilers, artificial intelligence, etc. Each of these jobs is broken down into multiple further specialists. Added to that, the people who deal with networking and the internet. How can we expect the average user to grasp that?

Coding is done at high level now, we don't know exactly what is going on half the time in the computer. When you program in machine code, you can track what's going on in the processor.

This sort of media outrage is not about Russian societies perceived homophobic attitude, it's about Putin's recent homosexual propaganda law, which is incredibly tame compared to any sort of law regarding homosexuality in Qatar.

Where is the anger over Qatar? I really hope, that when the time comes, that the same outrage (if not even more outrage) is shown towards Qatar during the World Cup and these organisations show that they are consistent with their views and this is not just political positioning.

As I mentioned, our 6 goals from corners is as much or more than 10 other EPL teams have scored *from all set pieces.* You can talk all you want about conversion rates from corners (not sure how you came up with 400-500 corners per year, given that that is averaging between 10 and 13 per game, which sounds crazy to me), but we've scored loads of goals from corners compared to most other EPL teams. 

Also, I used your estimates of 6 FKs scored and 2 or 3 non-header goals from set pieces to come up with the number 6 for aerial goals from corners, so you can't discount a further amount as non-headers.

My main point that you've shockingly missed, as a Liverpool supporter who watches our matches, is that our play is not based on aerial goals. We are second-worst in the league in terms of number of crosses put in per game. This is not a facet of our play. Where we can benefit from an aerial presence is on corners, as you pointed out. But, as I've said, we are already very good at converting from corners. Harping on the need for an aerial presence is the definition of nitpicking, for me.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"&gt;Isn't there enough to complain about without also complaining about when Lamela leaves for a better team which hasn't happened yet?

I didn't say he'd leave for a better team; I said he'd leave and achieve his potential with another club or he'd rot with us and never reach the heights that he should have. It doesn't require a crystal ball to predict that when talented players don't play they tend to want to leave. 

I don't know how long you've been supporting the club, but even if it's only 4-5 years surely you've seen this story before, right? I don't think it's unreasonable to harbor fears of history repeating itself. 


&gt;Or maybe lets just wait and see what happens this season and enjoy our successes?

What, then, is the point of a discussion forum? What would you like to occur here if not honest discussion about the club both positive and negative? ""Who is the most handsome player"" posts? Memes? Pictures of AVB's beard? Holtby selfies? 

I wouldn't want to be a supporter if I wasn't allowed to be critical of the club on certain issues in an environment that doesn't impact the team in any way. There is plenty to be positive about, and in the appropriate threads I will be. 

Ultimately if my future predictions bother you  pretend they aren't part of my post and read the rest. It's still a joke that a player who scored 15 goals in Serie A was treated like a 16 year old League 2 prospect by the previous coaching staff.

Something that's been leveled at Spurs fans over the years is having delusions of grandeur and I didn't really see it all that much until this season. Why the fuck are we so special that we ""can't afford"" to play someone like Lamela? Why can teams like Arsenal and Liverpool give frequent games to Oxlade-Chamberlain and Raheem Sterling ? These players are no more talented than Lamela, and when he wasn't a Spurs player fans of those teams would have taken Erik over them in a heartbeat. 

It is fucking nonsense. It's made me completely re-evaluate the way I feel about Gio dos Santos as well. The teams that develop young players give said players games. Lamela is one of the biggest talents in his age group and we were starting Aaron fucking Lennon over him rain or shine. For fuck's sake Lennon only has 10 more league goals in his entire cunting career than Erik had last season alone in Serie A. Christ, we could have been playing him on the left too. I don't even need to talk about how much garbage has been produced from those players.

The only people who are defending this shit are the idiots who only watch the Premier League and still spew garbage like ""SOME LADS JUST AREN'T UP TO THE PACE OF THIS LEAGUE! SERIE A IS SHITE COMPARED TO PREMIERSHIP FOOTBALL! DIFFERENT STANDARDS MATE!"" 

When Erik is fit, I will give Tim an opportunity to rectify the mistake made by AVB. If he starts getting games, great. If not, I'll be right back here bitching about us ruining a career and wasting fucking money. It doesn't mean I hate the club. It doesn't mean I'm going to stop supporting Tottenham; it's just fucking embarrassing to waste this player.

 Susie Gordon


Just travelling to China on business for the first time can provoke extreme culture shock in western managers and businesspeople.

But the explosive growth of China’s middle class ― a group which has mushroomed from just 4% of urban households in 2000 to 68%in 2012, according to consultancy McKinsey― is luring more and more companies to establish outposts, partnerships and joint-ventures within the Middle Kingdom’s walls.

So, what does it take to succeed as a manager or executive leading a company into China? How do you adjust when you’re entering the country for more than just a weeklong trip where knowing how to greet and socialise with business associates is crucial? And how can you make sure your business or division flourishes?

It certainly helps to understand the shifting shapes of Chinese characters and the subtle nuances of the two primary languages, Mandarin and Cantonese. But, more importantly, it’s critical to be able to interpret how business is done in the country.

For foreigners unused to how Chinese business culture works, the world of formal business banquets, fuelled by baijiu alcohol and pervasiveness of verbal contracts can be startling and confusing at first. Nearly every step of conducting business is different or at least more nuanced than it is in much of the western world and even in other parts of Asia such as Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.

According to China-based recruitment executive Brian Sun of Glasford in Shanghai, “The way the Chinese work in business is very results oriented — [it’s about] what can ultimately be gained from a deal or a process.” Sun feels western business culture focuses more on process and approach. He said: “In China, one-on-one interaction is not so common. It’s more of a team consensus. Western business culture encourages feedback, promotes development by taking risks, and prizes empowerment.”

Homework, homework and more homework

The most crucial step for succeeding in China: meticulous forward planning and research into the small print of employment and distribution contracts, compliance issues and the bigger picture of how the working culture operates, said business and culture consultant Andrew Hupert, managing director of ChinaSolved, a training organisation that helps westerners become more successful in China.

While that might seem obvious, this sort of legwork is also important for determining the best way to establish your footprint in China. Business operations aren’t always transparent among Chinese firms and many companies start out in partnerships or joint ventures as a way in. What’s more, relationships are valued above almost anything — and the concept of relationships, or guanxi, is far more abstract than it is in the western world.

Guanxi refers to the network of contacts and loyalties that form the basis of all business dealings in the country, both between Chinese and between foreigners and Chinese. The bottom line for managers? It is crucial to get to know your business partners. Without a strong social connection, no deals will be signed. In a practical sense that could be anything from always remembering to start your emails with an enquiry about your business partner’s family, to taking your Chinese team out for dinner and karaoke regularly.

For instance, it’s important to vet potential distribution partners much more deeply than you would if, say, choosing partners in Europe where laws about commercial contracts and compliance tend to offer you a level of legal protection and keep deals on the straight and narrow.

Among the biggest risks: partnering with a local client who uses your data or intellectual property without your permission to start a rival business of their own. Another significant danger is failing to understand that a Chinese partner will often say ‘yes’ in order to save face. This can lead to surprises. For example, you could be told that a container of goods has passed a quality control test when it has actually failed.

“No one gets more honest as the amount of money on the table gets bigger,” said Hupert. Before you share too much information, sign a binding partnership or give a potential partner access to intellectual property, “make sure that you’re dealing with the right sort of people, who understand the relationship in the same way you do.”

Relationships are everything

Western chief executives and managers often have a hard time wrapping their heads around these codes of behaviour.

Guanxi, in particular, is easily misunderstood, Hupert cautioned.

“Foreigners often take it at face value, and don’t understand the complexities, believing that anyone they spend time with owes them loyalty,” he said. “However, guanxi must be fostered and negotiated between business partners.”

Often, in China, this concept of relationships is valued above contracts. This might strike fear into the hearts of legally-minded westerners, but embracing the idea can be to your advantage since it also allows for a certain degree of flexibility in your approach.

In addition, the concept of ‘face’, a carefully balanced system of respect and hierarchy, is important. This difficult for western executives to interpret, yet it is deeply ingrained in Chinese culture. In short, it means you should never actively (or openly) upstage a business contact or partner.

Chinese business experts define ‘face’ as a complex, understated system of politeness, respect and reciprocity, which revolves around avoiding embarrassment at all cost. Western businesspeople often fall foul of this protocol by adopting forms of communication that are far more blunt than their Chinese counterparts are accustomed to.

Executive coaching services designed to teach the basics of doing business in China, have sprung up in the major cities, such as Shanghai-based REV which offers cross-cultural training. But often it’s best to learn on the job, suggest the insiders — observing how others operate ‘on the ground’.",0,1391725559,null,0,false,0,cf8vqoe,t3_1x7ur2,t1_cf8vqoe,t3_1x7ur2,null,1432285780,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

And yet, actual number of duels won per game, we're 16th.

And it's worse than 9 teams have scored.

Oh i see, people seem to think I'm talking about Suarez. No, I'm talking about LFC in general, and I would replace Gerrard, Flanagan or even Sterling with someone who is better at aerials. We can even replace our suffering RB position as well with someone who's tall enough to help block on corners, so that our only jumper isn't Skrtel. 
 
I just don't think we need to change anything about our setup in terms of attack to gain this.

&gt;Who is the most handsome player"" posts? Memes? Pictures of AVB's beard? Holtby selfies?

Same here since that's not what I'm advocating, although I quite enjoy Holtby selfies

It's the delusions of grandeur that I am also questioning. We're a for-profit team, ostensibly working toward building a new stadium and consistently finishing in the top 25% of the league. No small feat. Especially when ENIC can't seem to settle on a manager, which is a real criticism of something that has already happened. What I don't personally like is the constant belly-aching about subjects that we (probably) have little insight into. We don't know why Lamela wasn't getting games early on, or how he's played in practice, or how well he's settling in, and we especially don't know where he'll be next year. 

I completely agree with you with respect to Dos Santos. I always rated him, even though he does appear to be a little lazy and bitchy, but he was also very young at Spurs. However, I don't understand why you'd trash Lennon in order to make your point about Lamela who will hopefully be an every game starter eventually. Few players have put in as good a run at Spurs since I've been a fan than Lennon. I see him disparaged constantly. Why? He has his flaws, but he's played plenty of great minutes for us. 

Anyway, I just don't see the point in all the doom and gloom.

Gerrard in the deep role, but I worry how mobile the midfield for Arsenal are. 

Allen and Henderson in the midfield should keep the workrate high. With Allen's pressing, and Henderson able to break forward and support.
These three make us look decent defensively, and is probably the most sound 3 we can field.  

I like the way Coutinho played coming back in the middle and making tackles (WBA or Everton Game cant remember). He needs to play around the Arteta area of the field. Last time we played Arsenal, we were missing the link up to our attack, and it was a lot of playing the ball up and hoping the front men could create against numbers. Cou if commiting himself defensively in this role should be able to get some good looks going forward. Obviously, I think this is the most important role. Henderson or Allen should be able to support and join the attack giving us a decent presence going up while Gerrard and the other are still holding the fort.  

Up front, I would play any two of SaSaS. Honestly doesn't matter which two for me. (Against my better judgement, I would sit Suarez (or play him instead of Phil) just to fuck with Arsenal, and bring him at the half. but we can really play any 2)

So we have a situation where he might have actually done it, but he might not have. If it is the case that he did do it, then you'll be convicting someone (the 'accuser') who was raped. It might be a false accusation, but we don't know that. Just like how we don't know whether Roache actually did it. 

If you wanted to convict someone for a false accusation, you'd have to prove that. It would be a separate case, an entirely separate trial. It would have to be proved just as a rape has to be. An awful lot of people in this thread have already reached their verdict on that, which is just as wrong as declaring Roache a rapist before the trial had even began. Innocent until proven guilty applies to false accusations as well.

For most jobs, when collecting references its just a call to who is listed as referee, and hmrc will be non the wiser, but if they do find out, the hmrc will claim back the earnings from the new employer, which depending on the job could potentially cause difficulties.

You're right he was good enough for Roma. And he did well in Argentina before that. And big clubs want him. And we paid 30m for him. All this evidence points to a logical conclusion: he should be a great player for us, or at least be able to replicate what he has done with previous clubs. But he hasn't. At all. The reasons don't really matter- whether its the fact that its a new league, he doesn't know the language, he is away from his family, homesickness, not getting laid enough, whatever. At the end of the day, he has not performed for us. He played a good assist to Paulinho which obviously important, and played a good game... against Anji. But in every other opportunity he has been given, he has not done well. 

And this is the part that confuses me the most... people on this sub are convinced that we will play much better once we drop Lennon and put in Lamela. Why? There's no precedent for this.... at all. People rag on Lennon and how he doesn't do anything, has no energy, etc. But **every single** time Lamela plays, he makes bad passes, he's muscled off the ball way too easily, tries to do too much when he does have the ball, and rarely tracks back. He has moments of brilliance that gets everyone in this sub hard, but that hardly excuses the rest of his performance in a game. You said in another post that goalscoring isn't everything when it comes to a player up the pitch. You're absolutely right, but I'm very confused as to why you (or apparently anyone else on this sub) don't think this applies to Lennon. When he plays as a standard winger, he's great. Not phenomenal, but he's much better than average. He can beat a man, he can race the ball to the goal line and cut it back. He holds the ball up really well (something Adebayor is given praise for, but ignored when Lennon does it) and links up with Walker and recently Eriksen really well. He doesn't have the greatest shot but when you look at other players that are on the field and their style of play, of course he's going to look for a pass. Two poachers and *usually* a LW/LM that likes to take a shot. 

I'm sure Lamela will come good. At least I'm definitely hoping for it. I hope he scores 20 before the season ends, and a hat trick against the Arse. But the way I see it, as it stands **right now** we are much better off playing Lennon. Sub in Lamela when we are winning. Play him in the EL. Play him in the U-21s. Then, once he's ready for the PL, play him for a full 90 in a league game. I'm sorry you took my comment as a cop out, since what I meant to say was that *anyone*, coach or not, can tell, from his past games in the league, that Lamela is not ready yet. I hope to God that he has impressed in training and looks more up to the task but in the games that he has played, he has not. 

On a more sentimental sidenote.... fuckin disgraceful how quickly some people on here forget how big Lennon has been for us. /r/coys bitches and moans when one of our great players goes to another team, whether it be Real or Utd and as soon as there is a glimmer of someone being better we automatically want to dump a good player who's played that position for us for a good number of years.

true,kde01,king,,"On Bale: the sale of Bale made us almost 100 M. Half of what the entire club makes in a normal year. You don't say no to that. Forget what the doom-and-gloom crowd is saying, when you get a ridiculous offer like that you *sell*. Who cares if Ozil went to Arsenal? Business is business. I highly doubt anyone that sanctioned the Bale deal was that surprised.

There's a lot of negativity among Spurs fans now because many of is were hoping for a high finish this year. The reality is, though, we have been punching above our weight for several seasons and this is the first season you can say we're performing at about (realistic) expectations. And we've had a lot of ups and downs this year. Mostly downs. And we're still one point of Europa League and four points off Champions League. We're doing well, all things considered. Very few teams come out of a slump like ours in pole position for a Champions League spot.

And if we don't get it? So what. Europa League is still a great competition (I've been watching it for years as a PAOK fan and love it) and we need to learn to succeed there before we can play with the biggest and baddest in the CL.

Patience, my friends. Keep singing and stand behind the team. We're Tottenham til we die, don't let a little speed bump deter you from supporting the club we love. 

These downturns only make the victories that much sweeter. We beat United away for the second season in a row. How many clubs can say that?

true,Hammelj,eng-kent,Tonbridge,"extending the school day to up to 10 hours ,the current budgets would have to be expanded by a massive amount for new teachers to teach in the extra 4 hours or increasing pay, paying for extra resources such as sports equipment etc which I estimate would add 30 percent to potentially if done badly doubling the education costs.

Also the advantage of this extra time would diminish substantially for the following reasons. Truancy would increase ,among less motivated students because they will not want to be in school for 10 hours ,and among even the best of us because due to this extra time spent working we will not be able to recuperate fully leading to weakened immune systems increasing the number of days spent off ill and also minor illnesses such as common colds will cause the pupils to not turn up with the prospect of having to trudge on for 10 hours rather than 6. The time would also be less effectively used as (i presume from what the BBC quoted him as saying) part of this would be set aside for arts or sport, this time would not be effectively used as sport is enthusiastically taken up by people who are good at it and this enthusiasm decreases exponentaly such as at my school the majority of anyone who would gave a toss about PE was in the top group with only a couple in the 3 groups below (both the male and female groups) having even an inkling of wanting to do it and at the first opportunity was dropped by all but the majority of the top group and those one or two in the subsequent groups, therefore that is one option off so the other, the arts where a similar situation applies but this time with some who do it because they had to pick something and so it is reasonable to believe that there would be a highly significant number of students who would make no use of these lessons and even reduce the utility for others in these lessons.

Finally the problem of timing when the new times are ,because either they will start to early or too late and so no one will be alert and ready to learn ,it would cause huge amounts of travel difficulties with the issue of getting 8.2 million children to school and home at times which would rush hours causing yet more logistical issues or peticuaraly in the winter getting 2,500 students in and later out of school in the dark",0,1391729983,null,0,false,0,cf8xtn1,t3_1wwxju,t1_cf8xtn1,t3_1wwxju,null,1432286828,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,mostly_posts_drunk,cnty-england,comfortably numb,"I don't have a source to back this up, but as far as I'm aware even in Britain erosion occurs over a (relatively) long time-scale, and although there are some very few areas that you can measure in feet or even meters per year, which will drastically change coastlines over the course of a century, those areas are well outside the norm. (although even inches per year will do that over a century.)

A much bigger worry is sea-level rise, although even that wouldn't hugely change the shape of the mainland, [here's a sea-level rise simulator](http://flood.firetree.net/), set it to +1 meter which is about the absolute worst case scenario for sea-level rise by 2100;

So... worst case scenario by 2100 we lose a chunk of Cambridgeshire and a tiny little bit of south Yorkshire, assuming we do absolutely nothing with regard to building sea-defenses, (although tbh Cambridgeshire is too low lying and is kinda fucked, sorry guys) along with some chunk of the beachfront property of some of the east coast.

Which is bad, but not nearly as dramatically different compared to 30,000 years ago or so when we were still connected via landbridge to France. So I mean, theres that.

Even an apocalyptic scenario of +7 meters just means we lose all of the east coast and Cambridgeshire drowns (yeah seriously, you Cambridgeshire guys are just totally fucked) 

Erosion? Meh... I worry much more about mankind not colonizing another planet before this one catches an asteroid, than I worry that Britain won't quite be the same shape 1,000 years in the future, in fact I'd imagine that within 200-300 years we'd have the technology to remake it into any shape we want, if we last that long.
