true,zed_three,null,null,"&gt; However, the reality is that this £24.5k does not include any of the costs[1] needed to survive or the taxes need to pay for them.

I mean, it literally does include the taxes needed to pay for them. Page 6 of the PDF I linked:

&gt; The amount of indirect tax (such as VAT, and duties on alcohol and fuel) each household pays is
determined by their expenditure rather than their income

So you can't take VAT out of the £24.5k, as you'll be counting it twice. It also includes fuel duties and vehicle tax! I don't know about stamp duty, but the *average* household isn't buying and selling houses that often.

None of those links makes the claim that the average household is paying anywhere near 60%. The only people who come close to paying that are people earning over £100k, and seeing as that's less than half a million people across the country, they hardly count as average.


Now, if you were to claim that VAT is regressive and punishes poor people, I would be right behind you. Again, from the ONS report, page 6:

&gt; In 2011/12, the bottom fifth of households paid 29% of their disposable income in indirect taxes, compared with 14% for the richest fifth.

That is certainly a valid argument--the market has changed. But I'm not so sure that is necessarily true for the entire market. As fans, we tend to focus on the best players in the world and their transfers. Can we honestly say Lallana is in that category? Luiz, who I personally don't rate too highly, has at least had a couple of years of decent performance coupled with last year when he was very good. Lallana has had one good year, and that's this year he's coming off of. Luiz is also a defender and has the potential, from a positional standpoint, to play for the next 8 years. I don't think you can say the same for Lallana.

I guess the easiest way to put it would be that I agree, the market for the best players has drastically changed. But the market for players who are emerging hasn't changed nearly as much as the top players' market has. There are players available who are good alternatives to Lallana who would be much less because of their nationality (or lack of being English) along with the club from which they come.

By Roger Blitz, Leisure Industries Correspondent

If getting back into the Champions League was hard enough for Liverpool FC, staying there will be even tougher.

The crushing end-of-season failure to win the Premier League, after coming so close, is tempered by the prospect of the return for the first time in five years of Champions League football to Anfield, home of England’s most successful club in European competition.


Pressure to stay there is acutely felt by Billy Hogan, Liverpool’s chief commercial officer. The new constraints of Uefa’s financial fair play rules on clubs’ finances puts the onus on clubs to maximise commercial revenues.

The days of owners putting up their own money to buy the best talent are fast ending. Uefa is forcing clubs to look to their own revenue-raising abilities – commercial deals, player transfers, merchandise and ticket sales – to invest in their squads.

Increasing ticket sales is not an option for a club based in a low-income part of the UK. The club is raising average adult season ticket prices for next season by the rate of inflation. So it is on Mr Hogan’s shoulders that much of the revenue-raising burden falls.

“Within the commercial team, we recognise that the revenues we generate go directly back into the club,” says Mr Hogan, who commutes between Anfield and the Boston base of owners Fenway Sports Group.

“And with financial fair play, that pressure on the commercial side is that much more.”

Liverpool’s finances are bolstered by its share of Premier League central revenues – up from £55m in 2012-13 to £97.5m. That will go some way to repairing accounts that showed a loss of £49.9m in 2012-13, though there is a big chunk of transfer costs to go into this season’s finances.

But commercial revenues are growing – up from £63.9m in 2011-12 (a 10-month period) to £97.7m in 2012-13. Five new deals have been announced in recent months, with US fast-food chains Subway and Dunkin’ Donuts, Indonesian airline Garuda, Indian mobile phone company Xolo and Vauxhall.

Another five will be announced over the next season, says Mr Hogan, though he quells talk of Champions League qualification creating a flood of potential new sponsors.

Commercial deals are brokered over many months and long discussions. “It takes a lot of different factors to partner with any property,” Mr Hogan adds.

“We don’t specifically sell around the Champions League. What we are really on about is the strength of Liverpool and the global fan base.”

Those fans were cheered on Monday when manager Brendan Rodgers agreed to sign a new long-term contract.

Liverpool dangles in front of potential sponsors a survey from sports market consultants Repucom that puts its fan base at more than 580m. It has 18 Twitter accounts in different languages. Asia is a big market for Liverpool. So is the US. The club is embarking on its seventh preseason tour there.
""We don’t specifically sell around the Champions League. What we are really on about is the strength of Liverpool and the global fan base""

- Billy Hogan, chief commercial officer

Manchester United has led the way with a host of commercial deals across global regions, and with other European rivals also trying to exploit the Premier League’s global reach Mr Hogan recognises that Liverpool faces an “extremely competitive” market.

Liverpool has one competitive advantage. FSG, whose majority owner is John W Henry, owns other sports teams, notably the Boston Red Sox, and this helps opens doors to some of its commercial deals.

US sportswear company Warrior Sports, the baseball team’s kit supplier, is now Liverpool’s kit supplier. Dunkin’ Donuts, was already a Red Sox sponsor and “that made the Liverpool discussion an easier one for them”.

Liverpool will also probably go the way of the Red Sox when it comes to exploiting its stadium for commercial deals. Anfield is to be redeveloped and Mr Hogan says the club has not ruled out a naming rights deal for the stadium.

But he says Liverpool will more likely mirror the deals at the Red Sox’s Fenway Park, which gives naming rights to sections of the stadium.

That is a few years down the line. More immediately is the return of Champions League football, with extra gate receipts to look forward to and, more importantly, a in share of Uefa’s TV revenues. Last season, the 32 Champions League participants shared €900m.

“There is an opportunity and a benefit to playing in the Champions League,” says Mr Hogan, “not least of which is a reflection of success on the pitch. Our goal is always to be playing in Europe.” ",0,1401208994,null,0,false,0,chsbqx2,t3_26m6l5,t1_chsbqx2,t1_chsbnh5,null,1433975558,8,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,8

&gt; &gt; The amount of indirect tax (such as VAT, and duties on alcohol and fuel) each household pays is determined by their expenditure rather than their income

Your quote and statement kind of make my point. Just because stamp duty isn't paid every year doesn't mean that it isn't a tax that should be included in calculating effective tax rates. 

&gt; Now, if you were to claim that VAT is regressive and punishes poor people, I would be right behind you.

VAT is regressive but that doesn't mean it ""punishes"" poor people. 

&gt; &gt; In 2011/12, the bottom fifth of households paid 29% of their disposable income in indirect taxes, compared with 14% for the richest fifth.

If somebody prefers another type of tea they just drink a different type of tea. It's a non-issue. His comment is exactly right in that respect, you can of course have a preference. It is also ok to feel uncomfortable about homosexuality.

His statement directly contradicts his (and his party's) view on gay marriage. Saying that being gay is ok, but then to say they do not have equal rights to marry as heterosexual couples is like saying you can prefer Earl Grey tea if you like, but you can't have sugar because traditionally only people who drink Twinings can have sugar.

Have you ever seen Jim Allister criticize Loyalists? He claims to hate violence, but realistically, he only opposes violence against Protestants. He stays silent when Catholics are attacked, when minorities are attacked or when loyalists are responsible for the violence. 

He created a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/jim.allister.1?filter=1) in November and has used it to criticise  Sinn Fein, DUP, Guardi, Short Strand, areas surrounding the fountain in Derry, students wearing GAA tops, Liam Adams, DSD, BBC, Amnesty International, Hass talks, Devolved powers, Good Friday Agreement, Nelson Mandela, nationalist boxing clubs, ANC and prosecution of soldiers.

 Why can he take the time to rant about how Mandela was a bastard, but not condemn the spate of racist attacks here?  Not to mention failing to condemn his shambles of a Councillor for posting those FB status' the other day, because 'It was in the past'. The fucking hypocrisy.

In any normal functioning country Jim Allister would be laughed at. He's the most effective politician here because he is *unashamedly* biased.

Doesn't say anything. He just says I see no countries who want to leave and many who want to join.

In all honesty, both Piazon and Hazard (especially Thorgan) out performed him if you compare them at their club level while in more competitive leagues.

I think its extremely unfair to Thorgan if he has to be sent out on loan at the expense of Salah taking his spot in the first team, especially since Salah only gained that spot due to fortuitous timing.

I think if we were to base the spots on the team off of merit I would give Hazard the spot in the first team and let Piazon and Salah go out on loan to a PL side.

Again, I think Salah is a bright prospect, but I don't think he should be placed above the other two just because he got a few first team opportunities this season.

The Battle of Britain was fought and won nearly a year before the Americans entered the war, Hitler already tried to invade and he failed miserably. The British navy was still the most massive and powerful Naval force in Europe at the time too.

Don't get me wrong the USA helped tremendously with supplies etc..., They were arguably the tipping point to fully squash the Germans.

The proportion with some prejudice in 2013 (30%) is lower than the proportion who gave this answer in 1983 (36%), but this disguises some considerable change over the years. In particular, it's notable that prejudice fell a great deal during the 1990s (reaching a low of 25% in 2000 and 2001) – but then shot up between 2001 and 2002 (from 25% in 2001 to 31% in 2002). The highest level recorded was in 2010, when 37% described themselves as prejudiced.

So basically prejudice spiked after 9/11 and during the last recession but as the economy has started to pick up again its fallen from 37% to 30% since 2010.

&gt;If Spain thinks it's representing the interests of it's citizens by blocking Scottish entry that is their democratic right.

Treating citizens as children who do not know what is best for them isn't democratic, IMO. I know Spain doesn't recognise the Catalan independence vote but they do recognise the Scottish vote, as such they should play the game in good faith.

Whoops, too late. We're not getting PR any time soon.

Truthfully, anyone who didn't vote for AV because they wanted PR absolutely had no idea what the political situation was and still is. It's the most absurd choice that anyone in the world could have possibly made.

The ""I want it all or I want nothing"" option is never good in politics, which is all about compromise and balance of opinions. And yet that's what we did. We want a much better democracy! Well you can have a somewhat better one or the same shit you have now..? Ok, we'll take the same shit we have now! Great!

You want to know how to achieve it? By having a smaller party get a decent amount of power in an election. We had an absolutely historically significant and ground-breaking moment where we almost stepped away from the same old 2 party system with tories and labour switching places every few years. Lib Dems made an agreement that got us a referendum that would have taken away the absolutely unfair amount of power the 2 major parties have at the moment with FPTP, that give us the crappy situation that makes political change almost impossible. And we voted *against* it!

The only way it can be achieved now is for something similar to happen again in future. But neither Tory nor Labour will give us such an option willingly because it would hurt them both significantly. It's absolutely mind-blowing that all the people complaining about Tory and Labour both being the same and crap and they want political reform and blah blah.

You are just outright attacking women officers as being physically unable able to protect you compared to a male officer.

No, I would argue that is a high percentage of the story of being an officer. I doubt many officers get into physical altercations on a frequent basis as they are taught it as a last resort.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"The Telegraph is actually a broadsheet.

At transfer rumours in general they may be crap (As most papers are regardless if they are tabloid or broadsheet) but they are actually one of the papers that is fairly accurate specifically when it comes to Spurs. 

Jason Burt and Matt Law tend to give us fair coverage to the club and do get information about what is going on with the club.

Now Hytner (incidentally a know Arsenal supporter) and another (who's name escapes me at the moment) tend to go out of their way to write negative articles about the club.

So I wouldn't give much credence to many transfer rumours especially if they are put out by ""[Insert Paper name] Staff"" (which all the papers do in a effort to increase click thru rates) as opposed to a specific author.  

For this article, Law putting it out there that there is a transfer kitty of £50m...he probably has an idea of the neighbourhood we are in. The Dawson and Soldado rumours have been floating around from a variety of sources so whether they happen or not I wouldn't be surprised if they had been discussed.

Well you're opinion is wrong. Whether or not you agree with the judgement or motivations of the Spanish government doesn't change the fact they've been democratically elected to represent the spanish electorate.

&gt;I know Spain doesn't recognise the Catalan independence vote but they do recognise the Scottish vote, as such they should play the game in good faith.

This seems to be a source of much confusion. Spain is recognising Scotland's right to vote on its independence from the UK and everything that entails. 

Spain is not recognising Scotland's right to join the EU, because the terms of entry have not been agreed yet.

Ignoring your bombastic rettitry rhetoric for a second (you want to get something in there about neckbeards and SJWs whilst you're at it?), I think the arguments that come up every time are simply people not understanding where the other party is coming from. The ""prejudice+power"" is just a definition. You don't have to subscribe to it. But let's get real: it is the only definition that matters. Yes, minority groups can be prejudiced and racist towards members of majority groups. But ask yourself this: is it equivalent, and what effects does it have?

If Diane Abbott makes some unfortunate, ham-handed and ridiculous generalisations about white people on twitter or whatever, who is affected by this? Are the white people who read it suddenly going to find themselves five times more likely to be arrested or searched by the police? Are they suddenly going to find themselves living in poorer areas beset by crime, earning lower wages, or have various opportunities in life closed to them for no other reason than the colour of their skin or the origin of their heritage?

The thing is, context matters. The only way racism against majority white groups in the UK is equivalent to racism going the other way is that both things are bad.

nobody was really asked if they wanted this, and any time people make an issue of it, outside of the tabloid media which nobody in power gives a shit about anyway, it's treated as taboo, most of the media tiptoes around anything to do with it (unless it's a positive story), makes a point to sweep anything negative which is relavent to immigration under the rug. the governments are pretty dismissive about any concerns and seem to think immigrants are the answer to everything from skills gaps to pensions to securing future voters, and then you get shouted at by self righteous idiots preaching the wonders of diversity from well off very white communities and jobs where immigration isnt going to touch them..

Khadija the first Muslim convert and wife of Mohammad was a successful business woman. His daughter Fatima was educated and considered a scholar though she died young. His grand daughter gave sermons that were considered the equal of the Fourth Khalif Ali Ibn Abu Talib. 

Sure places like Saudi ban women from driving and being independent, but Iran which is considered in the same vein as uninformed idiots has over 50% of university graduates, with women driving freely.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"&gt;The difference, I think, is that team like Chelsea have such a big budget during each transfer window that splashing money on young talent isn't really a ""gamble"" for them. 

Completely agree, the article is an absolute joke. 

It also completely neglects to consider the often largest cost with acquiring young talent: signing on fees and agent costs and wages, which can amount to millions, or even tens of millions for bright stars in demand by bigger teams. 

For every great young player who could crack the big time there are a number of big wastes of money who flopped, costing their club greatly in the process. It could be said that one of the reasons for Arsenal's stagnation over the past 5 years has been the exact sort of approach the article speaks of.

Yes, they have blooded through great talent- but like Everton would, they have lost a lot of the players once they hit the real big time, it could also be argued that this is largely because they were unable to raise their wages, because their budgets were being spent on other youth prospects who failed. 

Everton cannot afford to have a Park Chu-young or a Johan Djourou on 50k per week, we certainly cannot afford to have a Denilson on 60k (I kid you not), we need every bloody penny to be able to go out on that pitch and show us their worth. 

Maybe those guys only cost £10m initially on paper, but once you double that for the agent fees, and add on 3 years of wage packets- they cost arsenal £45m... For absolutely bugger all. 

Yes, certain things in football look like bargains when you selectively pick names and don't critically respond to the question you are trying to answer- but the fact is, if it was so bloody easy every team would be doing it.

The five years he coached Mainz' first team in the Bundesliga they were quite successful for the club (most successful in the club history actually, even more successful than when Jürgen Klopp was coach there), qualifying two times for the Europa League and generally punching well above their weight. He now left Mainz at the end of the season, although he he still had one year left on his contract at Mainz and the club wanted to hold onto him, so there is a bit of controversy there, but Tuchel is a top coach and it could work out very well. 

Also he speaks good English, if that's of any concern, and is still young for a coach (40 years old) despite his experience of 5 years as Bundesliga coach. And you'd probably need to pay Mainz some money for the one year left on his contract

I think we owe a great debt to the USA, mainly for tackling the Japanese, which freed up ANZAC troops for us to use, and kept the shipping routes to India open so we could fight there, and for the massive lend lease program which helped us recover the equipment we had lost at Dunkirk much more rapidly than we would otherwise have managed.

I agree that we could have defeated Germany without US help, in the end, however by that time I think we would have lost India, Australia, New Zealand, Burma, and all the other British colonies in the far east to the Japanese, maybe allowing the Japanese to come to the aid of Germany at the last minute by invading Russia via China, where they were making incredible strides. What effect this would have had on the outcome of the European portion of the conflict I can't say, but I don't think it would have been good. Neutral, maybe, but not good.

About the Ukip part... Well I don't support UKIP, don't like Farage that much and I'm pro EU, even though I think there should be some extra controls on immigration. So I suppose I'm more conservative than UKIP in that respect. 

Also to add on, the people begging on trains were indeed european, but the beggars in shopping centres were oriental, most likely Chinese, the beggar in Edgware Road was Middle Eastern.

I think top 4 is not in the cards:  the current top 4 isn't getting worse, and United can spend whatever it takes to get back in the mix. 

But still, top 4 must be the goal, if only to measure what is missing to get over the hump. 

That h bing been said, there are other choice fruits dangling from the tree. The domestic cups and then the slog that is Europa. 

I have no love for Europa with all of the pointless matches against sides too weak to significantly challenge Spurs (at least through the group stage) but not so weak as to run out the reserves. It's a taxing tournament, all the more so since we've got to get into it by winning one (or two?) rounds of qualifying before we even get Thursday night action, live from Kryborgistan. 

But Europe beggars can't be choosers, so we should set out to win the damn thing.

&gt; Aren't Muslim countries on the whole quite anti homo sexual

Depends on the social and historical context of those countries, which may / may not consider themselves ""Muslim"" to begin with. It depends on things like the influence of their own societal structures and history. 

For example laws against homosexuality in Pakistan, India and most of Africa are colonial hangovers. In Ottoman Turkey, same sex relationships may have been accepted to some extent. Also, ""homosexuality"" may not really have been understood in the way it is now. 

The Quran states that the people of Lot were destroyed for evil doing - there is an argument that the evil was one of rape, pillage and debauchery of which raping males was one - some argue that it is homosexuality as the use the bible scholarship and interpretation of the abbasid period. It's a very complex and large debate - which is changing daily as people argue it. 

All depends on context and how the social reality is understood.  The Ottomans practised fratricide which expressly forbidden by all faiths. We're they a ""muslim"" dynasty? 

&gt; and not exactly beacons of women's rights? 

Same can be said of this,  the idea of women's rights is also inseparable from context, in the colonial context it's also inseparable from the colonial experience. It was a battle ground for colonial parties, and also became a large part of the post-colonial debate.

A good example is the Hijab debate, which first became a symbol of ""backwardness"" due to the women in the ""modern"" colonial elite largely wearing hats and european style clothes. Thus a lot of post-colonial movements , which were secularist and modernist, made it something they campaigned against - famously it's one of the things Atta Turk talks about. 

However, when the post-colonial Islamists and modernists on the sunni and shia sides started putting together a platform of opposition against colonialism and the new secular post-colonial elites they then made the return of Hijab a symbol of that ""return to purity"" that makes up a lot of revisionists movements.

Again - social context and history are important. The Quran only states that one is modest and describes a garment covering that encompasses the body.

2. Dedicate most of his time in training to helping the defenders. 

3. Sign some more players. Not for the future, but for the now. 

4. Get rid of some useless players, like Aspas/Kelly/Lucas?. They're good players and i like them, but they're taking up wages and squad places that could be used for someone else. 

5. Work on the SASAS more. Suarez Sterling &amp; Sturridge. Do a SASAS vs all our defenders game. Make them best friends so that they work together perfectly and aren't selfish. 

6. Think of different gameplans. We're going to come up against buses a lot more this season. We were completely clueless when Chelsea did it, we need to have a plan for that.

7. Learn how to park the bus. If we come up against Real Madrid or Barcelona or Bayern Munich, we can't just attack all game. We'll need to defend and then hit them on the counter attack with SASAS.

8. Learn not to underestimate opponents. This isn't the Spanish league where a place in the top 3 means you'll win against pretty much everyone. Even the bottom teams in this league can and will beat us unless we go into every game with 100%. No weak squads against 'weak' teams.

9. Show players that they aren't bigger than the team. If Johnson is performing bad or Sakho is having a bad game, sub them out or drop them for the next game. Some of these players seemed invulnerable to being replaced just because they were part of our first 11.

2. Add depth, we can't just rely on our starting XI to get things done. We need impact subs and different options to break through opposition defenses.
3. Rotation. We need to be able to rotate the squad properly due to adding Champions League football next season. Need to prevent wearing out Sterling, considering he's only 19 still and we don't want to overwork him.
4. Consistency. We need to treat every game the same. No more Hull City, West Brom, and Aston Villa results please.
5. Preseason. We need a good preseason to check the fitness levels and overall performance levels of our squad. Preferably no preseason injuries to have a great start for next season.
6. Summer transfers. This kind of gets clumped with 1 and 2, but we need to make the correct transfers without paying the inflated prices for quality players.
7. I think we need to seriously hire a defensive coach for training. I understand we play attacking football, but what's the point when we can't keep a clean sheet. Our attacking play is phenomenal and we've improved on our set pieces, now we need to work on training the defense. We had the best defense when we had Steve Clarke at the club if anyone remembers.
8. Getting loans out or including talented academy players into the first team. We need to develop our in-house talent and build our own little Barcelona and raise the new Gerrards and Carras of the future.
9. With #8 said, we need to focus on our academy and make sure their development is encouraged, considering we have a manager who specializes in youth and individual development. We need to sustain our future successes through our academy and not depend on foreign talent.

Not at all, if possible. No matter what you do a car is always going to be better for travelling at night, doubly so in the rain. You can get a pinlock insert to stop fogging, or ride with your visor up by one notch. Turning your head to the side will blow rain off at speed, or you can wipe it off with a finger, it becomes second nature after a bit. Motorbike headlamps are all terrible, get adept with the fullbeam switch and make sure the lamp is angled properly. Dazzle from oncoming cars is unavoidable as far as I'm aware unless you're willing to ride with a tinted visor at night time, which opens up a whole new can of worms. If someone doesn't turn their full beam off when they approach you don't be afraid to flash and beep at that dickhead. 

It gets better with practice. You can sort of judge where you should be relative to an oncoming car and you can see what the road ahead will do based on lights coming round bends and stuff.

1) Keep our players together. This includes Agger, Lucas, Johnson and Aspas. If Johnson can sort his ""I want to play on the wing not defence! attitude he can be solid. Aspas is a good player who can be brought in if given the chance too. Agger and Lucas are also core team players. Fuck the people who want rid of players who've been at the club longer than they've supported Liverpool just cause they weren't playing to the best of their ability. Lucas went from being not important at the start of the season to irreplaceable midway through to ""Sell him, he's shite"" at the end of the season.


2) Keep a hold of the Steve Peters bloke and make him work for us full time.


3) Sort out our defensive problems, I don't think it's all our players, they are all decent players, but something has to be done regarding the whole back 5.


4) Sign an attacking player who can play along the front three, a full back (or two) and a defensive mid at the bare minimum.


5) Send Ilori, Robinson, Wisdom and maybe even a few younger players out on loan again.

6) have and Utilise a plan B. While our plan of come out and blow the other side away might work sometimes, it won't always and it feels like we have no other option to turn games around Once the other side figure out how to shut us out. Chelsea was a prime example of this. Some signings may help this.


7) Sort out the Away form. While we have created ""Fortress Anfield"" we still look shakey away from home and at times, without SAS^AS to outscore the other side out of the water, we could have potentially struggled to even reach 4th, that  is of course a bit of an exaggeration, but our away form was piss poor at times.

8)Rotate more. In cup games last season we practically used the same squads the further on in the cup we got. I hope to see Borini, Aspas, Ibe, Allen, Suso etc more, even if in cup games.

9) Learn when to shut the game out. Crystal Palace was an example of this, Chelsea too. We need to know when to go for 3 goals and when we need to just get the entirety of First Bus on the pitch and grind out a 1-0 win or hold onto a 2-1 lead.

10) More of the magic he is working ! BR is obviously still learning but he is doing a great job that I couldn't see any other manager available to LFC at the time of his appointment doing.

But unfortunately if you want Brit talent you have to overpay. I personally think £20m is a reach for him. £25m would be overpaying. £30m would be Carroll-esque lunacy.

That being said, I think he would be a decent signing. I'm going to take some flack for this, but if I had to choose between him and Lamps next season, I'd pick Tiago. 

With Luiz all but gone, we've only got Matic left who can play bully in the midfield. Tiago can still play that role, so we don't have to change our system too much when Matic is sitting out.

I can't see Mikel staying for another year on the bench, so unless Jose can get him to change his game, I think we would still need one more mid before next season. I think we will probably have 5 mids fighting for the back 2 spots, so we would have: Ramires, Tiago, Matic, Wulfert Cornelius, and one big CM signing before the summer ends.

The AR of sexual assault is (1) Defendant touches the Victim, (2) Touching is sexual. In fact, under the case of R v H, touching of clothing may be considered sexual. 

The MR of sexual assault is that the defendant must intentionally touch the victim, and there must be an absence of reasonable belief in consent. Rolf Harris has been accused of touching children.

Rolf would lack mens rea if he reasonably believed that the victims were over 16 under s. 9 (1)(c)(i). On the facts Rolf knew them reasonable well so knew that they were under 16. Also, for the victim who is under 13, consent is irrelevant - Rolf Harris is under strict liability in s. 7.

Secondly they seem to accept answers when people say they are *not* racist.

The study is outrageous.

Finally it did no testing to empirically determine the truth of answer in the event the answer was ""not racist"".

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Awww... now /u/Tijai has got his big boy pants on... isn't it cute.

Let me educate you on what Taqiya is before you trip over those clown shoes you've equipped yourself with at Jihadwatch's Luxury Emporium of Stupid. 

Taqiya is basically quiescence. Or for large scale intellectuals like yourself - tolerance. The guy who formulated it was Jaffar As Sadiq who is one of the most important scholars of Islam, and the 6th Imam according to the Shia.

What does it entail: Always protect ""huq"" which is the truth of God/ and justice but without conflict or violence when no other alternative is available.

Or be tolerant , provoke no conflict and prevent one if you can. That simple. 

So let's say Robert Spencer turns up at my house in order for a cup of tea. He doesn't want to talk about anything - but just have a cup of tea. Taqiya means - don't talk to him about Islam give him his tea. 

Let's say Robert Spencer turns up at my house and demands I come out and fight him, to defend Islam. I stay in my house. Why? because Bob isn't going to become Muslim if I beat him, he'll just hate me more. If Bob beats me I'm not going to become a Bob'ist ( because I have a hard time accepting Bob loves Jesus). Taqiya suggests no truth is found, no justice served by me fighting Bob. So I stay in my house. 

Let's say Bob gets a shotgun. Bob comes into my house and puts a gun to an innocent guest of mine and says ""You say that I, Bob bring the truth, or I will kill your guest. Justice puts the life of my innocent guest above my need to proclaim my faith - this is where Taqiyah says - accept Bob's conditions because *your guest is innocent therefore* **justice** and the **truth of God's mercy** *demands you protect him.* Your guest is not responsible for Bob's attitude or your disagreement. Your guests is your responsibility because he is in your house. You must keep your guest safe. 

However, if Bob turns up at my door with said shotgun and points the gun at my head I can decide whether acquiescing to his demands serves humanity better or giving my life is better. Taqiya would mean that I would have to decide wether accepting Bob's demands that I do as he says serves the greater good, in that it lets me demonstrate to him that he should change his ways by staying alive and teaching him. If not then does my sacrifice serve any purpose , will it speak the truth to Bob's power, will it make other's lives better? 


Mohammad gives a perfect of Taqiya when he negotiated the Treaty of Hudaibiayah. The non-muslim Meccans saw that the document text referred to Mohammad as the messenger of God. They objected - ""We do not recognise you as a messenger, if we sign this you would make us accept that, you must change it."" So he asked Ali to scratch out the phrase and make the text neutral. This upset the Muslims but Mohammad pointed out that this act of tolerance opened the hearts of the Meccans. 


Now we can debate this further in the spirit of true Taqiya. Or you can go back to haunting that bridge of yours.. 

Up to you.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Apologies  - I'm tired of arguing this all the time:

My standard response to this ( and yes I have to use it quite a bit because .. it's the way it is): 

According to Abda-Rahman ibn Abi Zanna:

    Asma was 10 years older than Aysha

(Siyar A’lama-nubala, Al-Zahabi, Vol. 2, pg 289, Arabic, Muassasatu-risalah, 1992).

According to Ibn Kathir:

    Asma was older than her sister Aysha by 10 years

(Al-Bidayah wa-nihayah, Ibn Kathir, Vol. 8, pg 371, Dar al-fikr al-`arabi, Al-jizah, 1933).

According to Ibn Kathir:

    Asmah's son was killed during that year and died 100 days later.

(Al-Bidayah wa-nihayah, Ibn Kathir, Vol. 8, p. 372, Dar al-fikr al-`arabi, Al-jizah, 1933); Ibne Asakir vol 69 Page 18; Alsunnan Alkubra Albehaqi Vol.6 Page 204).

According to Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani:

    Asma lived a hundred years and died in 73 A.H (693 CE).

(Taqribu-tehzib, Ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani, p. 654, Arabic, Bab fi-nisa, al-harfu-alif).

So let's do the calculation

Birth of Asma: 693 -100= 593 C.E

Birth of Aysha , who is 10 years younger than Asma: 593+10= 603 C.E

The marriage occurred after the Battle of Badr - 624 C.E

624-603=19

That's the maths.

Now here's the language Arabic can be very precise when it comes to language ,especially when they denote specific ages.

    “I was a young girl (jariyah in Arabic)”when Surah Al-Qamar was revealed.""

(Sahih Bukhari, kitabu’l-tafsir, Bab QaulihiBal al-saatu Mawiduhum wa’l-sa`atu adha’ wa amarr).

That Surah of the Quran was revealed eight years before exile from Medina so around 614 C.E. If Ayesha was nine in 623 CE or 624 CE, she'd be a newborn infant.

How do we know this - in Arabic Ayesha uses the word ""Jariyah"" which means young girl. A newborn is ""Sibyah"".

That word ""Jariyah"" is important because it clearly defines a stage in girls life. Now bear that in mind when I quote one the most prominent scholars in Islamic history - source for a lot of the Salafism you see in Saudi:

Ahmad ibn Hanbal says that when Khadija , his first wife died in 619CE , the clan came to him and asked :

    “You can marry a virgin (bikr) or a woman who has already been married (thayyib)”. They mentioned Aysha as ""bikr"" or a virgin not as ""jariyah"" young girl. Bikr is used for an unmarried with no sexual experience prior to marriage. (Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Vol. 6, pg 210, Arabic Dar Ihya al-turath al-`arabi).

Although we're nowhere near on that level, and I'm not trying to say we are either with this analogy, it is the same principle as to why some Germans went along with the Nazi persecution of Jews. It's not necessarily that an individual is inherently racist or the like, but rather that the easiest people to blame in society are foreigners. I mean, who has less power in society than the average working class citizen? There's only immigrants really...

It frustrates me immensely though because, when you truly think about it, there's no real logic in the matter. The only way immigration can harm a country is through flat-out overpopulation, but that is not just to blame upon immigration. What about those awful parents who live on nothing but council welfare and yet have eight kids to their name? A pet store would not advise the poor to have a dog, so I see it as no different for children.

At the end of the day, although I am far from religious, I think that as per Jesus' teachings (paraphrased) we should really stop looking at the speck of sawdust in the eyes of others and acknowledge the plank of wood in our own eyes.

These could be officers for the ultra specialist branches who are failing.

I say you single out women officers because they are the three examples you provided. Accusing me of starting the gender argument is completely accusatory and disingenuous. You are suggesting that, ""any of them [women] who can't pass the physical tests a man would have to should not be allowed on the front lines of policing"". How is that not bringing in gender into the debate? 

You are advocating for the removal and subscription of women to the police force on the basis of an ideal 5.4 bleep test (a test carried out a year later mind, forgetting they all passed the initial test). Is that all there is to being a police officer for you? Physical strength? I don't think anything would save a male of female police officer from a gun shot by passing a 5.4 bleep test.

Moreover you say, ""there's plenty of jobs for them [women] to do that aren't there though"" for what reason? That they are women? You didn't elaborate. Please explain what jobs they should take, without bring gender into the debate of course!
 
There are plenty of bad candidates who have no idea how to interact with the public and are hired by the UK police force. Is that not a problem for you? The educational standard for being a police officer is just about as low as a 5.4 bleep test.

true,jvdbization,lfc68,,"&gt;Gerrard has played as a deep-lying playmaker since the turn of the year. Not as a holding midfielder. You're fundamentally wrong in that aspect, and Lucas is definitely not a deep-lying playmaker.

Again, your broad stroke statements are both tactless and silly.  Gerrard HAS transitioned to holding midfielder.   The fact that Gerrard brings different qualities to that position doesn't change the fundamental responsibility of covering the back four and admiraling general play.  If you wan't to call it ""deep-lying playmaker"" fine, it's a semantic argument that has nothing to do with Lucas.  No, Lucas has never been able to spray balls 40 yards across the field, but very few players can.  Gerrard's ability in his new role is unique, which is why it has been such a revelation, and why Lucas has little hope of displacing him.  

&gt;You're fundamentally wrong in that aspect, and Lucas is definitely not a deep-lying playmaker.

If you think Gerrard's success in the new position is defined soley by playmaking you should take a moment.  Gerrard has always had the ability to cut defenses with his customary pin-point long-balls.  The revelation came with his ability to break up play, protect the back four, and sometimes even play between the centerbacks in a faux back-three as the fullbacks went forward.  It's an entirely new positional dance he had to execute, and there were some who doubted he could.  There was much more riding on his transition than team chemistry, his career longevity was a huge factor.  The way he took to his new role so quickly while maintaining his play-making ability, the Villa game being the only real bump in the road, was a large part of why we won 11 in a row.  

Lucas was the one entity that suffered from this revelation.  And to measure him with the same stick as Gerrard is just stupid.  Gerrard's back-up isn't going to be able to effect the game like he does.  So when your argument is basically ""Lucas isn't the player Gerrard is"", you'll understand why the word ""stupid"" comes to mind.

Illegally, it is possible to buy a painted airsoft gun and replace the colored parts with aftermarket parts that aren't painted.

I will not admit to watching a lot of Swansea games, but he didn't exactly cover himself in glory when we played them (he was woefully out of position for the tame Moses effort that went in, if Migs let that goal in, he'd be slaughtered). Also, I probably trust Migs more than Vorm when it comes to coming off the line and dealing with crosses. Vorm is extremely short for a goalkeeper and I haven't seen anything to suggest he would represent an improvement in those areas.

I think a lot of people write off Migs as ""not good off his line"" or ""not good with his feet,"" but from his displays this year, I think he has it in his locker to improve in those areas. You have to remember he was playing at Sunderland, so ""stay on your line and hoof it long"" was what was drilled into him. I've seen moments this season (I remember him Cruyff turning an onrushing striker) that suggest those are areas of his game he can improve, just like Reina did. I remember people saying the same things about Reina during his first two seasons.

I also think people downplay Migs' contribution this year. How many HUGE saves did he come up with in those 1-0s at the start of the year or in those games where we were holding on for dear life at the end? I can remember plenty of incredible saves at big moments. We wouldn't be here without his penalty save against Stoke.

Eriksen is fully capable of playing on the left (obviously) the issue with Eriksen on the left wasn't that he was somehow being wasted outside, it was that we made no adjustments to the rest of the squad and as a result screwed up the defence. 

Tim put Eriksen out on the left but basically gave him free roam and took away his defensive responsibility.  Yet we didn't seem to shift the midfield to cover for this. When we were in a 4-4-2 it effectively left us with 3 players who didn't track back as well as the entire left side manned soley by Rose. In a 4-2-3-1 we still seemed to not shift either of our deep CMs over to the left to help Rose or failing that shade one of the CB's further towards the left with a CM covering deeper.

The issue was never Eriksen out left, it was that he was given free roam on the pitch and not much emphasis placed on tracking back.  If you are going to use this strategy it makes more sense to put Eriksen in the middle where the defensive impact would be lessened while still maintaining the offensive capability. Tim inexplicaby never adjusted the rest of the squad setup and continually left Rose exposed.

In 2004, Chelsea signed Didier Drogba for £24 million. 3 years before that, he was also playing in the second tier league in France. When Chelsea dropped the cash for him, he had only spent 1 season in top flight French football.

Not very much different from Lallana's situation I'd say. The only difference is Drogba was playing in the Champions League for that one season he was in Marseille, whereas Lallana hasn't played a drop of CL football yet.  Drogba joined Chelsea when he was 26 years old - the same age Lallana is now.

Obviously there's going to be a bit of a premium as well, since he's English. Coupled with the fact that Drogba came from the French league, whereas Lallana has played in the Premier League.

true,Titanomakhia,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt;some of the citys in england now are muslim only.

Not only is this ignorant and plain wrong but it's contributing to the exact same problem. Muslims represent less than 5% of our population. Even if every Muslim in the country crowded into London they wouldn't even make up 1/4 of the population there. Compared to countries like the USA or even Germany this country is still incredibly homogeneous and particularly white. 

&gt;this is truly shocking for a country that used to to shine so bright

Indeed so bright. Back when we used to murder between 370 and 1000 non-violent protesters in Jallianwala Bagh garden in Amritsar in 1919 or when massive policy failures lead to the Bengal famine in 1943 killing between 1.5 and 4 million Indians (and arguably also the Irish potato famine in 1845). Or when we invented the concept of 'concentration camps' in the Second Boer War eventually working or starving to death somewhere in the region of 25,000 people. Or when we detained about 1.5 million Kenyans in the Mau-Mau uprising raping, torturing and murdering an unknown number but certainly many tens of thousands of people and starving thousands of children to death in the fortified villages and evidence of which the Foreign Office ordered its colonial authorities to burn in an attempt to cover it up when Kenya was decolonised. 

But hey! At least we wheeled out the hackneyed, now pathetic and laughable claims that we Brits believed in liberty and the rights of man such that we would oppose Hitler's barbarism. If Hitler and Stalin had not existed Britain and Churchill would likely be remember how Nazi Germany and Hitler are remembered today. 

So bright, so bright!

If we need deep lying midfielders we shouldn't be getting rid of the only player that we have that slots into the DM role.

It would be great if he was a little more versatile, but as is he is absolutely essential cover for Gerrard and useful to us in cups and the like.

We should still be going for another central midfielder, someone with strong defensive capabilities, who can play in several positions and hopefully make breaks on the counter from deep. sounds like Javi Martinez or Emre Can would do the job.

I know it would never ever happen, but I think Jack Rodwell would be an ideal signing as well. He fits the mold of some of our best recent signings.

Also you can't really get nominated for player awards unless you play most of the season and Eriksen only had 25 appearances compared to Lallanas 38.

Maybe Lallana isn't worth £30m and does have a premium assositated with England internationals but he would be a very good player for us to have.

So if it takes you 3 months to get a job, then you are talking 9 months before you can even apply for the visa. Then whatever the processing time is.  

You can try and get her a family visit visa, and while you still have to act as her sponsor and show that you can support her during that time, any money that she has can count and you don't have to have held the job for six months. However she can't switch to a spouse visa from a visit visa from within the UK. However she can't work or study while on a visit visa, and she could probably only get one for up to six months. 

Another thing to consider is that she won't get a visit visa if she can't show enough ties to her home country to necessitate her going back. Such as a job, rental contract, university course, commitments such as that. If she doesn't have that, and she is visiting her husband, then they will assume that she wants to stay.

Well you can't have it both ways - either we look at previous posts as evidence of intent, or we don't. 

The fact you've gone on to do so for myself - but presumably not for /u/ShanghaiNoon - is quite the double standard. 

&gt; You have regularly attempted to downplay issues of racism because it ""makes you feel guilty""

If one thread counts as 'regularly' - although if you read everything said  there you'd see I go on to advocate a formal official investigation into those responsible. *My interest was in ascertaining the facts - not accepting anecdotal evidence and no formal follow up as a reason to get concerned*. 

&gt; Yes, we accept that Fineus, but disregarding the problem where it does exist isn't helping anyone. 

See my previous comment - full investigation into those responsible please. Where is it? Can you in all good conscience say I'm wrong to ask for such a thing so that the issue can be dealt with - if so why? 

(If anything I'm calling for a more productive official route to stamp out racism there than you are, which is kind of ironic!) 

Bringing it back to this topic however - I'd be interested to see how snide comments about white people and British culture (which are /u/ShanghaiNoon's m/o) are helping the problem at all. 

It might help to keep in mind that *everyone* is capable of racism - not just white British people. The double standard I mentioned earlier in this post is an interesting note on this.

The other issue for some leaders is the Spitzenkandidat system altogether (the process used this time, for the first time).

To say someone has an agenda generally suggests that even they don't really believe the nonsense they're spouting but are doing so to further personal or political interests - and it's important to note that simply having an agenda doesn't automatically make the point invalid, a group that want to clear all the footpaths of litter might continually focus on removing litter with the end goal of a more pleasant world -this is an agenda but it doesn't stop any individual action being right or the over-all theory being sound.  
  
The original comment was simple, direct and described a real phenomena -  people will try to excuse their racism by claiming other groups are more racist, which is incidentally a logically unstable argument on many levels and this hints it's being used to further a racist agenda - however  that's not to say you're following the agenda, likely you've simply picked up a talking point, maybe you even really believe your racism is excused by others? it's hard to tell, but that's ok because it doesn't matter because the argument is easily defeated using critical thinking skills so it's easier to concentrate on discrediting the idea than the person presenting it.",0,1401267611,null,0,false,0,chsz80c,t3_26mcji,t1_chsz80c,t1_chsyf0a,null,1433986822,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; ...confusing the word 'agenda' with 'opinion' when really they're not the same at all. 

Er, they can be entirely the same thing. When your agenda concerns the furthering of your own opinion then the two do mesh. Given the negative connotations - perhaps we could say 'vendetta' instead of agenda if you'd prefer? 

&gt; To say someone has an agenda generally suggests that even they don't really believe the nonsense they're spouting but are doing so to further personal or political interests

I'm not sure we agree on the meaning of the word 'agenda' - if that's what you believe it means. 

&gt; The original comment was simple, direct and described a real phenomena - people will try to excuse their racism by claiming other groups are more racist, 

What makes you say it's a phenomena? Are you saying it's wrong to point out that many groups are capable of racism - not just one (traditionally white people and in this case white British people)? 

What's really interesting to me is that at a glance I didn't see any indication that only white British people were asked if they felt a level of racism. 

Britain is a multi-cultural place now - so I'd be keen to see exactly what races or cultures the people in this study came from (was it all white British? Or are several cultures saying they feel a level of racial prejudice?). 

If anything that backs up my point that /u/ShanghaiNoon is at fault by leaping to mention white people elusively when - accurately and fairly - it is not just white people who are capable of racism and for any fair study we should accurately quantify every demographic of race to draw proper conclusions.

**To clarify:** 

I don't believe racism or sexism or homophobia is excused from one group because of its existence of another. 

However I also believe it's entirely unfair and hypocritical to focus on just one group as 'perpetrators' and the others as 'victims'.

I think Pochettino will help in this respect, his team always played decent football, if not *better* against the top 4. Also, it didn't help that we committed so many fucking errors that led to goals, we topped the table on that. Injuries, like always for every team, didn't help us one bit and trying to integrate half a dozen new players and 2 managers always made this a transitional season. All those things considered, I'm optimistic top 4 as always is achievable but totally realistic and wouldn't see top 6 as a failure.

Liverpool while having a one-off season will be in and around the top 6, and United will chuck money at shit and hope it sticks, so obviously it's going to be difficult. In our favour though, Liverpool have no depth and despite their fans believing they will win the title next year I don't think they will compare to this season. United need to strengthen a LOT, defense and midfield, and we all know how throwing money at half a dozen players works. Everton will be losing some great loanees too. Chelsea/Arsenal/City - they've always strengthened. We've always challenged. It's 11 v 11 at the end of the day, and if Pochettino can instill that belief of ''we can beat anyone on the day'', who knows?

Europa I wouldn't mind winning. It's exposure in Europe no matter how small and also next years Europa winners will get a CL spot.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;the other guy raises a fair point that often other cultures are racist against white people. You guys just shrugged it off as some 'positive discrimination' type whining, 

Nope what he was doing was trying to make minorities responsible for their own discrimination. It's a typical tactic used in these debates to then derail the conversation into how the minorities are bad and then blame them for the problems of society. Follow the rest of the threads and you will see that happening.

&gt;A national survey accounting for national demographics is inherently not representative since there is a large variation is local demographics.

And you're doing the same. A national survey is a national survey. Statistically the methodology will have answered all this because it's a national survey, it's not localised. A 3000 person sample is fit for purpose.  

You're basically trying to discount a survey for the question it asked not being the question you don't want to ask. 

&gt;There's also the tremendous issue of bias in people self certifying whether they are racist or not. Thus, this study could equally represent attitudes towards racism (and how honest we are to admit it), than actual racism. 

Which is why you look at the methdology and work out what mechanisms they used to account for this - because a study this large conducted with ESRC funding or any proper funding would not be able to get off the ground if it didn't have these considerations taken account of in the first place. What people are doing is nit=picking over  a process they don't know and can't be arsed to find out about.

&gt;I'd say that the entire study was conducted to make a shitty headline like this one

No there is not a media conspiracy. This is a piece of research done by a public organisation. It has to have its terms of reference out in the open. The British Social Attitude survey has been going for a long while - it's a respected public policy instrument. Arguing that it's there just to make headlines is just arguing from ignorance.

Remind me to quote this at you when you wheel out the old ""Islam is not a race, it's a religion"" argument.

Actually it does matter because what it indicates is that the whole analysis that ""it's religion"" is bollocks and the whole phenoma has social/historical/cultural dimensions to it.  It indicates that if you argue about ""honor killings"" and then shift into an argument about ""culture"" you're being intellectually dishonest. 

What's hilarious is that people like want to shift the ground you argue on with total freedom because the logic and intellectual honesty of an argument is less important to you than blaming a minority. 

So it does matter, because it disproves the essentialist nature of these arguments, it disproves the idea that cultures and behaviours are somehow inherent to a set of people.

My path was the following:

* Yamaha YBR 125 (1 year)
* Triumph Trident 750 (1 year, but spent half that time fixing it)
* Suzuki SV650s K3 (1 year so far)

I'm currently looking to upgrade, but I think the SV or a bandit is a good first 'big' bike. I knew one bloke who went for a 400 after his test, which was good for insurance. One of my friends is doing his test next week or so and is looking at an Yamaha XJ6 (Diversion). They're good reliable bikes that can take a bit of a beating, plus they tend to drop in value to &lt;£2,000 and then hold their value. You can normally pick up a mid milage one from gumtree or auto-trader for ~£1.5k.

Other than that some other ones you might like to consider are mostly around the 600 area. They'll have more than enough power for you for a couple of years and are cheap compared to the larger bikes.

A few bikes you might want to look at...

Suzuki:

* Gladius
* Bandit
* SV650
* GS500

Honda:

* Hornet
* CBR (if you're that way inclined)
* CBF
* Deauville (Good if you're looking at covering loads of miles, I cover up to 20k miles a year and if I had known I would do a fair bit of motorway riding, I might have gone for this, but it's quite bulky and hard to filter, maybe put it off for a third bike)

Yamaha:

* Diversion
* FZR

Not a comprehensive list. But might lead you to some other stuff.

No. I'm not actually racist. My girlfriend is black, I was raised in a multicultural part of Southampton and I have friends from various ethnic backgrounds. Unless you have some weird definition of racism that isn't based on what racism actually is...? 

Have you ever been mocked by liberal people? There's a subtext to your post where you seem to take this all quite personally.

&gt; rioting in the streets when elections that don't go their way 

What? What are you talking about? The only riots that happened in recent years were the London riots, which were essentially a mass theft exercise that began when Mark Duggan was lawfully/unlawfully (depending on who you ask) shot dead by police. Unless you're talking about the single issue protests like the student fees or environmentalists, which would invalidate your statement about liberals and losing elections. Unless you mean the EDL getting into a couple of fights with anti-fascists?

If you are UK resident and UK Domiciled you are liable to UK tax (capital gains tax and income tax) on Worldwide Income and Gains.

If you are Non UK resident you are only liable to UK income tax on UK Source Income and are outside the scope of capital gains tax.

If you are UK resident and Non UK Domicile, you are liable to to UK tax on Worldwide Income with the option to claim for remittance basis. 

Now to your question:

As the above demonstrates whether or not you get taxed on your overseas employment income will depend heavily on your residence status in the UK.

There are fairly 'newish' statutory residence and split year rules set out in the Finance Act 2013, Schedule 45. You may wish to have a read of these, this part of the legislation is set out quite well and fairly easy to follow and understand.

However, I would still advise you seek specialist tax advise for clarification on your tax situation depending on your specific circumstances.

Hope this helps!

You don't have the background or the learning to understand what you're quoting , and you're using quotes from Islamaphobic websites without the context to know what you're talking about. 

I mean you can't even be arsed to even quote the rest of the **same wikipedia entry on the same damn page**

Surah Nisa deals specifically with ""Kafiroon"" ie the army that's attacking themm, aren't athiests or people who left the faith because of conscience, they're people trying to kill the community.

Even then the rest of Nisa goes on to lay out conditionality  

&gt;""So, if they hold aloof from you and wage not war against you and offer you peace, Allah alloweth you no way against them."" 4:90 

By the way. Muslims read the four "" Quls"" a lot. That means Surah Ikhlas, Kafirun, Falaq and Naas are the most understood and most recited Surahs except for Surah Fateha. know what Surah Kafirun says?

&gt;Say : O ye that reject Faith!
I worship not that which ye worship,
Nor will ye worship that which I worship.
And I will not worship that which ye have been wont to worship,
Nor will ye worship that which I worship.
To you be your Way, and to me mine. 

Surah 109.

That's all of it. Four lines. So while people like you go digging into the depths of Surah Nisa and try to find nuggets to hate on. Every Muslim recites these all the time and it's what they understand. It's one of the clearest and most obvious Surah.

**1.** If you don't take on part of the deficit you fail (Scotland needs immediate capital to pay for services, no-one will lend money to a debt defaulter and if they do then there will be many strings attached, maybe some of that juicy oil?).


**2** No currency union, the rUK will not underpin another countries financial decisions. You can pin your currency to the sterling but you can't have the union. A new currency will not be stable as Scotland is a new country relying on mostly volatile markets (oil prices anyone?)


**3** A lot of businesses will move to rUK, a few banks will (EU legislation means that both the registered and head offices of a company must be in the EU member state that it does the majority of it's business. Scotland WILL NOT get automatic EU entry, hence hundreds/thousands of jobs come to rUK.


**4** Scotland WILL NOT get automatic EU entry, it's law that they have to re-apply. Yes, they have jumped through all the hoops (same standards, production standards etc) but they have to apply and ALL member states have to vote yes. Spain, Italy and maybe a few other countries could say no, it all hangs in the balance. 


**5** A lot of infrastructure that Scotland relies on, is in rUK, Scotland will not get it, they'll keep what is proportional to what they take in the debt but they won't get it all. This will need to be built (think oil refineries and such). This costs money, capital Scotland needs to raise and will most likely have to get loans for.


**6** You will have to compete with rUK in a lot of things, Navy shipbuilding projects will move to rUK (loss of Scottish jobs), you don't want trident, if it moves to rUK (more jobs lost). rUK will have more political, financial and industrial clout than Scotland. Investers will invest in rUK, not Scotland (unless Scotland offers them large incentives, some of that juicy oil maybe?).

You see where all this is going. Alex's white paper is so full of hot air, if it was a stone, it'd float. The rUK will support your right to go independent, hell if I had a vote I'd vote to support your decision. But once you're gone, you're on your own and you reap what you sow. If you want back in the union well, I'd take ALL your powers off you. But that's just me. Oh and I'd take the oil too.

CBR's are typically a bit expensive, but if you're vigilant you might be able to snap up a good deal at the end/start of summer.

I'd agree somewhat on the price of Triumphs though. Their Daytona 675 is expensive due to it being relatively new (more so with the 675R). Their older models can go for a good price, but will need a bit more care than the SV or GS. The older Hinkley Triumphs commonly have a sprag clutch problem (which is a pain), but then I have an undying love for them so I can't stay away.

yeah that's a better word i guess, although likewise it implies nothing about the facts of the matter and is simply a distraction 'don't look at the facts, look at the person bearing them!'  
  
&gt;What's really interesting to me is that at a glance I didn't see any indication that only white British people were asked if they felt a level of racism.  
  
first glance at the title? because if you'd read the article you'd know these things were considered and such data is available - the article even talks about the complexity of this, '[Joy Warmington] said the makeup of prejudice was complicated. There are tensions between black and Asian communities – highlighted by the riots in 2005 and 2011 – as well as between white and non-white groups. “It is about class and deprivation and also the result of very poor management of an ethnically diverse city and region. '  
  
To claim that no one is talking about this is rather disingenuous when the article talks about it from various perspectives, another example from the article;  
  
""Dr Grace Lordan, from the London School of Economics, said her own research based on BSA data going back to 1983 showed a clear correlation between recession and the numbers who self-described as prejudiced. Her research found that the group that recorded the biggest rise was white, professional men between the ages of 35 and 64, highly educated and earning a lot of money. Their attitudes may directly affect others as many will have managerial responsibilities.""  
  
and a bit where they explain their collection and analytic method

&gt;Once the survey is over we compare the profile of the people we have spoken to with the true demographic makeup of Britain (as recorded by the census) to make sure that our results are properly representative.""  

And as if your theory wasn't already secure enough in it's grave let's add one final big nail to the coffin - ""The data is in stark contrast to other indicators of social change such as attitudes to same-sex relationships and sex before marriage. By those measures, the UK has become a more accepting, liberal country."" were as you suggest this demographic shift because of fundamentalist Muslims and etc then this wouldn't be the case.  
  
&gt;I don't believe racism or sexism or homophobia is excused from one group because of its existence of another.  
  
however you seem to be siding with the people who are basically saying 'britain is only racist because of brown people, we should kick them all out!' or at least 'yeah, country is getting worse because all brown people are the same!' i'm sure you'll see how silly both these views are.  
  
The reality of racism, sexism and homophobia is it's the people in power creating unfair situations for underprivileged, disenfranchised and minority groups - generally based on distrust, misunderstanding, misrepresentation and other common biases.  It's of course often the case that people from dispossessed and outsider groups resent those with cultural and economic hegemony either justly or some what-unjustly - to zero in on these sentiments when expressed and use them to justify the ill-actions of the hegemonic group is not only disingenuous but it's absurd.

Almost all of the advice ITT, is perfect.

* Crack open the visor/use a pinlock anti-fog thing.
* Rain Racer (or equivalent hydrophobic sprays)
* Slow down, drains are slippery and hard to see at night.
* Get brighter bulb (Best advice, especially on smaller/older bikes)
* Good waterproof gear! If you get cold and wet your concentration drops dramatically. Neck tubes in rain are a must for me.
* On motorways the outside lane can be dodgy. I found it easier to get dazzled by oncoming traffic when the light reflects off of droplets on your visor, but depending on seat height, it could happen in any lane so take care.
* If you're coming up to a corner and a car comes the other way, slow down and don't look at it, trace the curb/edge of the road with your eyes instead, it will lessen the dazzling effect from the car and still give you a view of what the road is doing, so you don't go straight when the road goes bendy, you should have a good idea of what's happening from looking ahead, but you might not remember what it was like when you've got a box of metal flying past you and you can't see anything.",0,1401273565,null,0,false,0,cht07pr,t3_26mvih,t1_cht07pr,t3_26mvih,null,1433987287,3,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,3

If we get someone like Lukaku, our very expensive Spanish investment would be warming the bench the entire season. If Ade leaves, then of course we'll need a replacement - but that's a Remy or maybe even a Bony.

I say sell Kaboul only if we get a decent offer, we likely wouldn't. But he's had his trouble with injuries and was very shaky at times. I'd be sad to see him go, but id rather sell him than anyone if were offloading centerbacks. Agreed on Danny and Ade, though I really doubt we'll get much in the way of fees for Ade. His wages are fucked and everyone knows it. They'll also know that we'd be happy to just get him off the books. Wed be lucky to get 5m for him unless we can convince Monaco or someone that we totally can pay them. I'd add fringe guys like Livermore and Falque to the list. Livermore back to Hull, Falque to whatever Spanish side wants him.  As for purchases, or main priority is obviously LB. Rodriguez would likely be upwards of 20-25m. Wolfsburg don't need to sell at all. I'd love nothing more than to bring the guy in, I just don't think we will. Gotta get someone though, Davies seems more realistic. Even with Poch I don't expect Shaw, and Coentrao wants CL and likely big wages. If Ade goes we should also get a striker. Lukaku is basically Rodriguez here, outside shot.

I will be taking a more pessimistic approach to the season. We have a new manager and likely turnover in our attacking ranks. LB is yet to be filled and world cup injuries may still strike.

true,LightningGeek,eng-staffordshire,Wolves,"For me, it was mostly just getting out there and actually running. I was working a physically active job in a warehouse as well at the time.

I worked out a 1.5 mile circuit near my house and just timed myself running it every day. I found that for me the best way of improving was to keep track of my times publicly. There was no way to cheat and no way to miss a day without people asking why. I also did my runs straight after I woke up, on an empty stomach. I also ran 5 days a week after a bit of practice.

At first, don't worry about needing to stop and walk parts of it. After the first run or two, you'll know your pace and will be able to run the whole distance in one go. After that, you just need to concentrate on getting the times down but they will come down quite quickly at first.

Always slow down and walk after the run rather than stopping suddenly. After that make sure you stretch. 20-30 seconds for each stretching position is good. You'll be able to run virtually every day if you make sure you cool down and stretch properly. Don't be afraid to miss a day though. If your legs are not feeling right it is better to take a rest day than to injure yourself and lose a week or two of training.

After that it was a case of just bringing the times down till I could do it in under 11 minutes, which happened in the month. What took longer was getting the time done on a treadmill. That just meant going running at the gym twice a week to practice on that, and then to bring the times down. Before the fitness test I stopped running for two days. Just to make sure my legs were fully rested

How fast can you do the mile and a half right now then? Have you been given the RAF fitness booklet at all? That has a few good exercise ideas in it as well as showing you a few stretches to help you. If you have a while till your fitness test, throw in some longer runs as well, it'll help with your stamina, especially as you'll need to run longer when you're actually in the RAF from what my mate has told me.

So long as the EPP has enough allies across the parliament to meet 50%, which it does, that gives them pretty much exclusive control over who the commission president is, and the council's nomination system is actually pretty irrelevant so long as most of parliament believes in exercising its own power.

Cameron may not like the Spitzenkandidat system, but it's not an artificial project, it's the natural consequence of requiring the president to secure 50% approval of parliament. Things will still have to change, but it will have to be Juncker who does it, lest the EPP loses control or the EU becomes entirely ungovernable in the next election.

His point was that at Porto AVB's team was constantly surging forward, it battered the opposition with constant surging attacks.

Poch's style (in a truly simplistic account) is much closer to what we thought we would get when we first hired AVB. If nothing else we should move away from the stagnant, lateral attack that we were stuck in under AVB.

That's true, but there's a clear trend of growing Euroscepticism over the past decade (its now 10 years since the 2004 expansion) and a continuous decline in European Parliament voter turnout across the continent (since 1979, the first EP elections). It wouldn't surprise me to see Juncker become Commission President, with current on-goings being a high-ball starting position from sceptic leaders. That puts Juncker under immediate pressure to reform and certainly goes against the mandate he probably expected and certainly wanted. The UK + other sceptics is an issue for any Commission President. The UK + France (not sceptic in UK terms, but definitely needs reform given the rise of FN) + other sceptics is a much larger issue. 

&gt; So long as the EPP has enough allies across the parliament to meet 50%, which it does, that gives them pretty much exclusive control over who the commission president is

True, but as I said, the Parliament would must avoid being labelled as utterly ignorant to growing Euroscepticism. Unless the financial crisis across Southern Europe or mass youth unemployment across all Europe is about to reach its natural end, then something is going to need to change.

&gt; If we think of the European Council as a collective head of state, this is a bit like the Queen getting annoyed that the parliament won't elect her choice of Prime Minister.

Which we absolutely should not do. The Council is almost indisputably the most powerful organ in the European Union. Yes the Parliament's powers have grown and yes the Commission retains the sole right of initiative. But the Council still holds more voting power than both and, lets face it, the European people clearly view their domestic leaders as 10x more legitimate than their European leaders.",0,1401277742,null,0,false,0,cht12tv,t3_26ofbo,t1_cht12tv,t1_cht0wpx,null,1433987759,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

When he has the ball at his feet it's simple passes sideways or backwards with little or no creativity 95% of the time. He's clearly struggled with the high pressure game of the premier league and if you watch a full match with him in his ability to pick someone out higher up the pitch is glaringly poor for a central midfielder. His play in central midifeld in terms of passing, ball control and creativity deep is similar to that of catermole, not someone of a club pushing for top 4.

The only ways he's going to work is if we either push him further forward (at the expense of who?) or he gains a lot more confidence in possession and becomes more accustomed on the ball and the pressure the game is played at here.

The only part of his game that's better than dembele's is his goalscoring, everything else (most notably CENTRAL MIDFIELD PLAY) is weaker. And if you think that's something we can accept, take into account the number of goals we scored this season is attributed to our weak build up play from deeper not just shit wingers/strikers. A central midfielder's job is so much more than getting in the box and scoring goals.

&gt;Methodology  
The people selected to participate in the survey are chosen using a technique called random probability sampling. This technique ensures that everyone has a fair chance of being picked to take part and the results are representative of the British population. Once selected, participants are interviewed in their homes by one of NatCen’s interviewers.

They don't state their confidence values or show how they decided that 3000 was a appropriate sample size, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was about right.

edit: In fact I just did a quick check, seems for a population of 60 million, a sample size of 3000 is enough for a 99% confidence level with a 2.5% confidence interval. I.e. if 30% of people say they're prejudice then they're 99% sure that the actual value across the whole population lies between 27.5 and 32.5% (under the assumption the sample is random).",0,1401279587,null,0,1401279917,0,cht1jae,t3_26oh1j,t1_cht1jae,t1_cht0s78,null,1433987975,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Of course, specific hospitals may have internal feedback mechanisms and complaints from patients or other specialities are often fed back to individual doctors if there's a learning point. Many EDs also have 'missed fracture' policies where doctors are shown x-rays where they failed to spot a fracture.

And, some particularly conscientious doctors do follow up their patients by tracking what happens to them, but that only really works if the patient is admitted.

It's worth remembering that most 'diagnoses' from ED doctors are better described as a 'working diagnosis' or a 'likely differential'. This happens because medicine is a lot more uncertain than people appreciate and it's actually unusual for there to be one overwhelmingly obvious and easily provable acute medical problem and because ED doctors are usually working with limited information and limited access to diagnostic tests.

What's more, EM isn't necessarily about always making a diagnosis, it's often as much about minimising the risk of immediately serious illness. For example, think of someone with a headache, my job isn't necessarily to decide whether it's a cluster headache or migraine, and it certainly isn't to think about malignancy, my job to assess the risk of sub-arachnoid haemorrhage or meningitis and to investigate until I am happy with that risk. If I send that person home, it doesn't mean that they don't have brain cancer (because I wasn't looking for that) and it doesn't absolutely, 100% mean that they haven't had a brain haemorrhage! just that the I perceive the risk to be acceptably small.

Firstly, the graph doesn't to my mind demonstrate a worrying increase in racism.  Rather it's mostly flat with an overall slight downward trend.  According to the data people last year were no more prejudiced than before September 2001.  

Any amount of racism should concern us, but are we working ourselves into a moral panic about how bad the situation is?  [This survey](http://islamicommentary.org/2014/05/pew-anti-roma-anti-muslim-sentiments-common-in-several-eu-nations/) shows that  of European nations surveyed the UK is near the most tolerant of Jews and Muslims.

A hypothetical: A new guy starts at your work, and they are a Nigerian from Nigeria. He looks just like the Nigerians in all those [419 scam baiter websites](http://forum.419eater.com/forum/album.php). 

Do you assume they are a criminal? Consider that the only contact you've ever had in your life with any Nigerians was via Nigerian scam emails.

Standard for us or standard in the world, because the former makes it much worse and that latter certainly doesn't excuse anything that happened and certainly doesn't mean people can look back and say our past was wonderful and we 'used to shine so bright'. 

&gt;it is useless to dwell on it.

Well, firstly ignoring it and acting like it didn't happen is insulting to the many people whose lives are still affected by our policies in other people's countries. And secondly, apparently it needs to be said because people are still looking back and our past and complaining that this country isn't great any more. People are looking back with such a disordered attitude repainting our history as if we were a light unto the nations and somehow the arrival of immigrants is tainting our faultless way of life. I've said before it reminds me of Serbia during the Bosnian Wars; people looking at their past and seeing it divided upon ethnic and cultural lines. All it then takes is a charismatic leader to come along and stir up ethnic tensions, create an us v them attitude and tell people not to worry because he'll take care of the problem ethnicity. We're certainly not at that point yet and I don't believe it's ever been Nigel Farage's primary intention but he's using people's latent xenophobia and their arrogant attitude to the country's past to gain votes. He may want to get out of Europe for many varied reasons but he knows many people when given the chance will say they want to get out of Europe to avoid foreigners. He doesn't care what their reasons are as long as they vote for him.

You can't blame him for our weak build up play so much, his run of games at the beginning of the season was plagued by our static attacking and a role in a new country/team.

I honestly cannot believe you compared him to Cattermole. Cattermole would have no chance at being in the Brazil squad and whilst Paulinho has not been his best this season I find that ludicrous.

You said it was unfair to make any accusations - then went on to do the same. That's the very definition of double standards my friend. 

&gt; But can you back up the assertions you've made about Shanghai? One's like these?

Given enough time - yes I could (assuming they've also not deleted any posts). 

I semi-regularly delete mine as a matter of course these days - though I imagine most people here could substantiate that if anything I argue more about cyclists than matters of race. None of this means I'm in some way not allowed to call someone out when they're due it - just as you're trying to do to me - again you can't have it both ways. 

&gt; It seems to me that Shanghai is a Muslim or at least sympathises with Muslims, therefore it would be unwise of us to discredit his views on issues of racism against him and other Muslims.

Why? For fear of hurting his feelings? 

I'm a white British person - here you are trying to discredit my views - *again* you can't have it both ways. 

&gt; It's absolutely vital we understand the sentiments of such people if we're to adequately tackle the issue - not just discredit them as white people haters as you have done.

I'm tempted to side-track into the views of militant agenda-chasing feminists vs. those who merely want equality for women. Blindly assuming someone is the later purely because it suits you to assume they are is quite nonsensical. 

*You may or may not be interested to note that I've not replied to many others throughout this thread making similar statements - why? - because many others aren't trying to discredit white people before they've even posted. Doing that is a pro-actively hostile move implying white British people alone (since he singled them out) are at fault - everyone else is not.

Makes really good late runs in to the box, clearly has a good touch and plays some nice (and effective) flicks and backheels. Deceptively skillful for a central midfielder although he certainly doesn't try to be showy.

Cons:
Lacks quality medium and long range distribution and vision, certainly not the kind of player who's going to be pinging it about and dictating the pace of play. Also concerningly lacks defensive awareness. All too often this season we would see his partner go forward with the ball or off the ball too press and Paulinho would not be in position to cover, costing us a goal. He did very little to make me confident of the solidity of our core. He also faded badly from games and at times in the season looked exhausted. I'm hoping these later points can be attributed to a difficult first season in the Prem after a big move and that we will see him really step up next season. There is the concern though that he is just an expensive Brazilian Jenas.

Would certainly have had a better season playing in a midfield three, although I find it strange he performed well for Brazil in a DM pairing

true,DrRedOrDead,eng-yorkshire,Smoggy in Durham,"&gt; A debt is only as good as the terms being achievable - money markets have no emotional attachment to lending including to defaulters the issue will always be current risk worthiness.

Exactly, a Scotland that defaults on it's debt is a very risky investment. Alex implied that if the UK didn't allow a currency union then Scotland wouldn't take it's share of the debt. Hence no investment or investment with more strings attached. Scotland will need investment from day one or it'll be pretty hard going.

&gt; England will need to find its new currency. No? Why not is it because Scotland is not in union with england more a client state?

England and the rest of the UK will remain using the Pound Sterling. Nothing will change for us. If Scotland chooses to have sterling either it takes it without Westminster backing which, if shit hits the fan you will not get a bailout. If there is a currency union then there will be many strings attached and rules set by the Bank of England and Westminster which will just put large portions of Scottish policy under rUK control.

&gt; A lot of businesses will move to Scotland - an EU country directly next to England with who know what favorable tax breaks.

But you are not a EU member state any more, you left. You are an independent nation in Europe. Not the European Union. A business will more likely move to the financial sector of London at which point both it's headquarters will have there (assuming it does most of it's business in rUK).

&gt;  Salmond will got to Paris and Berlin and get a deal.

If Spain says no, you don't get entry. Simple. Paris and Berlin might say yes, they might say no. Spain with Catelonia troubles and Italy with it's troubled might very well say no. What then? What's the back up plan. What if the Spanish demand fishing rights in Scottish waters?

&gt; You know they will have absolutely no hurdles they are already part of the club they will stay part of the club they will get an immediate deal like Switzerland or Norway to have many of the benefits while the paper work goes through.

Yes but to become a member you still need the vote. Norway can trade with the EU but it cannot influence economic policy. Neither will Scotland.

&gt; Yes raising money for oil refineries will be difficult - I can see that.

This is a large one, iirc Scotland gets most of its petrol/diesel etc from the Teesside oil refinery. So either build your own or buy it (which means market forces /taxes).

&gt; Of course Scotland will offer perks that is what all small nations on the side of big economies do. US companies will rush to base themselves in the new capital.

Why base in the new capital when they can base in London? What can Scotland offer that rUK cannot? Tax breaks? If they want to do business within the EU better to have your headquarters within the EU. Is it worth a gamble on whether or not Scotland can enter?

Scotland could absolutely take care of themselves I am in no doubt of that. But it's whether or not they will be better off alone. I think not. If it goes tits up and you have to rejoin the union you can bet Scotland will be set back years. If rUK takes you back at all. Small countries rarely succeed in the world stage. We are better off together. I understand the reasons for independence hell, I'm pissed of with parliament. But the best option for Scotland is to stay in the union and ask for more devolved powers.",0,1401282449,null,0,false,0,cht2dx6,t3_26n86z,t1_cht2dx6,t1_cht0oi0,null,1433988375,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I think the reasoning behind replacing him was to find a cheaper option, Reina is on huge wages, he's probably in the top 5 at the club (not exactly undeservedly) but has become error prone and like the club [almost expected](http://www.marca.com/2013/11/08/en/football/barcelona/1383937664.html) to be heading to Barca to replace Valdes. The club pre-preemptively moved for Mignolet to make sure we were covered and then Barca decided to focus on a newer keeper instead and Pepe got stuck in a limbo. For a while Rafa took him on and he looked set to stay there but once again another position was prioritized and Reina was released.

Reina is a fantastic keeper but so is Mignolet, neither is going to want to play second fiddle and with Reina's wages and Mignolet's six year advantage I think the preference will be to try and move Reina while we still can. He signed a six-year contract in 2010 so I guess he'll be around for another two seasons unless another suitor comes a knockin'.",0,1401282521,null,0,false,0,cht2esb,t3_26ovvg,t1_cht2esb,t3_26ovvg,null,1433988388,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

And yet ask yourself the following questions:

- Do you view some races as harder working than others?
- Do you see some races as more intelligent than others?
- Does the race of a person make any difference to who you would date or marry?
- Does race make any difference to your choice of porn? E.g. would you see ""Hot Asian lesbian sex scene"" as equally enticing as ""Hot African pygmy lesbian sex scene"" or ""Hot Eskimo lesbian sex scene""?

TBH, I'd view a certain amount of racial prejudice as inevitable. All we should really concentrate on is that in our every day dealings with other people, we should treat them as individuals, and judge them for themselves, rather than according to any sort of prejudice, racial or otherwise.

&gt; Given enough time - yes I could (assuming they've also not deleted any posts).

Do it. You can't go round making those kind of accusations without substantial proof. As it stands, that is a defamatory statement.

&gt; Why? For fear of hurting his feelings?

No, because we risk alienating minorities and exacerbating racial tensions. If people feel discriminated against – and as the data shows, rightly so in this instance – then of course we expect some resentment or animosity against those they feel responsible. 

However, it would be wrong to state that all white people are at fault. Shanghai ought to have been more clear in this regard. But there are certainly white folk who will go around accusing minorities of racism, in an attempt to discredit genuine concerns these minorities may have. 

&gt; I'm a white British person - here you are trying to discredit my views - again you can't have it both ways.

I'm not trying to discredit your views, my intention was to demonstrate how your argument is fallible, an ad hominem attack on Shanghai. I don’t think he's trying to discredit white peoples views, but highlight how racism against minorities is often discredited by counter accusations of racism. Yes, racism exists within minority communities, but this is often due to the behavior of (some, not all) of the white nationalist population.

It's basically the same reasoning behind Lukaku's loan to Everton. Got to show off his stuff and hike up his price, got PL experience, and potentially (can't be arsed to go back and check) took off points from Chelsea's competition. 

Unless Chelsea sees us as a non-threat to their predicted league position next year, then *maybe* they'll want to talk but even then Lukaku's price will be incredibly high. It just seems like a much smarter decision to sell outside of the league.

So really that's completely irrelevant to the topic at hand and actually distracts and detracts from the conversation? 

I'd have thought discussion over matters of racism were far more important than giving me a taste of anything! 

&gt; Do it. You can't go round making those kind of accusations without substantial proof.  

No. You just opened your post by saying you wanted to give me a taste of my own medicine - someone who prioritises that is not someone I'm going to waste time proving myself further to - we can both access their post history, feel free to investigate on your own time if you won't or don't believe me for whatever reason. 

&gt; As it stands, that is a defamatory statement.

So is a blanket comment about white British people possibly *quite rightly* pointing out that many demographics can be racist. 

&gt; No, because we risk... ...exacerbating racial tensions. 

Precisely what you'll get when you make blanket statements implying racism in white people as the original post in contention clearly does. 

&gt; But there are certainly white folk who will go around accusing minorities of racism, in an attempt to discredit genuine concerns these minorities may have. 

Just as there are certain black / brown / indigo / mauve folk who will go around *being racist* - who won't be called on it because in this country we've instilled the mindset that it's impossible to be racist *and* anything else but white. 

&gt; Yes, racism exists within minority communities, but this often due to the behavior of (some, not all) of the white nationalist population.

Wow. You went there. 

So what if racism in white British people is on the rise due to the behaviour of (some, not all) minority groups?

Ultimately I'm chasing equality. If white people can be racist - so can every other demographic. It's no more appropriate for a black person to be racist towards white people than it is for a white person to be racist towards black people - you just can't have that both ways.

true,JamJarre,cnty-uk,Liverpewl,"It depends on what constitutes 'racial prejudice'.

Is it legitimate to characterise French people as rude, for example? Or Scottish people as tight with money? How about locally: are Scousers thieves? Are Londoners rude? Do men only think about sex? Are women rubbish drivers? Prejudice is everywhere and frankly, anyone saying they're not is basically not examining their own views carefully enough.

I spent many years living and working in China and I can say without hesitation or apology that I find a lot of Chinese culture repellent. Behaviour towards race, sex, mental illness, personal responsibility, general rudeness... there's plenty to dislike. There's a good chance that I'll dislike a person who has grown up in that culture, embodies it, and is proud of it. Same with countries that have horrifically sexist laws, like Saudi Arabia.

However, does this make me racially prejudiced? Isn't it reasonably to assume, when you meet someone of a certain nationality, that their culture has instilled its values in them? These issues are complex, and deserve a better debate than the immediate jump to racist/not-racist that the Internet tends to throw up.

&gt; Legitimacy comes from a genuine and publicly known choice before an election, and the members of the Council did not win their respective elections on the basis of supporting a specific European Commission President candidate, nor do they publicly nominate their regular commissioners.

They do have a different legitimacy, but this overlooks the immense power the European Council has. They are so much more than a collective version of the Queen. They are the key power in the entire European Union, with competencies in each of the most important areas and in many exclusive competency.

&gt; I think the two bodies derive a different kind of legitimacy

With regards to the Parliament, the UK presents a very difficult issue. The incumbent Government have never won a European Parliament election. The official Opposition has won every single time, with the exception of 2014 when a minority party (in the sense UKIP have 0 Westminster MPs) won.

Certainly, most white folk are not dangerously prejudiced. But I think his point was more along the lines of, “certain white people will discredit these findings by accusing minorities of racism”. But these racist sentiments are often a byproduct of prejudice they have encountered in their lives. 

&gt; Just as there are certain black / brown / indigo / mauve folk who will go around being racist - who won't be called on it because in this country we've instilled the mindset that it's impossible to be racist and anything else but white.

No, as I have stated previously, and you have once again chosen to disregard, there is certainly racism within minority communities. But the issue has far less potential to be dangerous then animosity against minorities. And, again, this racism is in part due to hatred they have encountered from nationalist groups and the far right. But, just to reiterate, this is no defense of racism within minority groups. Bigotry is unacceptable, no matter what race you may be.

&gt; So what if racism in white British people is on the rise due to the behaviour of (some, not all) minority groups?

It certainly is on the rise, thanks to the behavior of small fringe groups such as Anjem Choudry and the Rigby killers. But it doesn't help when racist white folk go on twitter and call for the beheading of all Muslims, or accuse all Muslims of being sexual predators and the like. Something I have seen plenty of, mind you. If you think the racism white people suffer in this country is anything comparable to that incurred by minorities, you're either extremely ignorant or living in denial.

In the technical context, internal time outs over UDP may fail. So you might have a bit of code that checks the server is there with a ping/pong, which assumed that if no response is received in 2 seconds, the server isn't there. 3 second latency would mean it would think the server wasn't there.

In a human sense, consider a pure UDP skype scenario. You say something, and it's 3 seconds to get a response and another 3 seconds before they get a response. So an extra 6 seconds per exchange, a quick casual conversation all of a sudden becomes a pain in the ass.

Just imagine 3 second lag on anything, it would be relatively annoying compared to &lt; 100ms lag on a normal broadband connection.

UDP doesn't guarantee receipt, or ordering or many other quality control stuff, so it's typically used in applications where a few packets can afford to be dropped. So UDP based applications are typically designed or purposed in a way that they wont suffer so much from an imperfect connection.

The positivity that /u/TheShed1905 mentions does not necessarily have to come with the volatility of the sheer mass of managers we've had in recent memory (not to mention the squad turnover).

I was, first and foremost, excited about the prospect of bringing back Mourinho if only because it suggested to me that RA might have recognized utility in having someone here for the long haul (as José was the longest -tenured manager he'd had, BEFORE even bringing him back). It seems like they have both learned enough since José's first spell here that they knew they could build something bigger and better, this time around. 

The stability we can get from having the same tactics (and the same tactician) from year to year can be as valuable as having another player on the pitch.

I, for one, think and hope Mourinho can survive the axe this season even without bringing home a trophy. With the squad we're expected to have, I certainly *expect* to challenge for every trophy for which we're in the running, but as long as we see improvement, I'll be fine with next year (perhaps a little regression against the top teams is in order with the other managers adapting to José's tactics, but I expect us to gain points overall with a better ability to break down parked busses and therefore get more points against relegation-threatened teams).

I just simply find it an irrational expectation to crave trophies EVERY YEAR. All top teams want them, but there are only three (perhaps four) worthwhile trophies every year. We can't blow up the team and start over from scratch every time we miss out.
