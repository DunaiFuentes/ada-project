true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;After all, that's the whole point of the EU, making things easier in Europe but that brings some possible negatives.... which are still the same as long as the balance is at zero.

No, that is not the point of the EU at all. We do all we can to reduce the levels of crime, of violence. Its not about evening things out, if we can reduce crime in this country by preventing criminals from entering we will. 

&gt;And the same applies in the country. Are you 100% safe just because it's Britain's responsibility? 

No, I have explained this several times now, we are responsible for our borders, and they are responsible for theirs. The way to prevent criminals from getting into a country is for THAT country to impose proper boarder controls. If we control our boards properly and they control theirs properly, no criminals would be able to get into either. 

We are not responsible for anyone else having poor boarder control. If thousands of illegal immigrants were getting into the UK every day by swimming across the channel, would you be complaining to the countries they were coming from? No of course not, you would be blaming our own boarder control. 

&gt;Why would it be fine to stop someone at the border, because he served in prison, yet it's perfectly fine to let past convicts walk through streets if they are of the same country of origin? 

Because they are on OUR STREETS. WE take responsibility for them. 

If you have an dog that violently bit you for no reason, you have to take responsibility for him. You can put him down, or you can keep him locked up in a cage, or you can let him wander around your house. But if you wanted to visit a friend who had just had a new baby, and they asked you not to bring the dog, in case it attacked the baby, would you be offended? What if he hadn't bit you for a while? I still think its reasonable to ask not to bring a dog round that might be a liability.

In the same way, we might say that a criminal has been rehabilitated, but the rest of the world only has our word for it. If you had a choice between sharing a room in a hotel with a person who had been to prison for murder, and one who had not, you would choose the non criminal. In the same way, if you have the choice between sharing a country with a murderer and a non murder, you would choose the second, even if it was only for a short time. 

&gt;Making things harder, equals harder for yourself as again, checking everybody's convictions means you wouldn't be able to go this weekend to Paris, just because you wanted to do some shopping. You would have to wait for few months, until your file is checked as after all, you can potentially be an ex-convict, so a risk to French citizens.

Countries in the EU could share information on convictions, many already do. Makes the process much quicker. The alternative is what you have just seen, let criminals through without checking and risk getting your citizens murdered. Sorry if it spoils your trip to Paris, but I value a child's life over your shopping trip. 

&gt;Does it really care if its a British making a crime, or a Portuguese? Or a person without a visa, or with visa? Or a person who got here illegally anyway?

If someone commits a crime when in a country illegally it would defiantly matter to the family, who would not have lost a loved one if the procedures had been followed. 

&gt;In fact, the study tells you a completely opposite to what you propose:

The data you are providing is completely irrelevant. Migrants may commit less crime, then again blond people might statistically commit less crime. Does that mean we should only let in blond immigrants? 

We are not discussing which groups commit more or less crime, we are talking about wheather or not we should let people convicted of serious crime into this country or not. 

If you want your data to be relevant, go and find some statistics on how many CONVICTED immigrants RE-OFFEND when they move into a different country.

Societies - a lot of them are epic value. Skydiving for 10th the price etc. Fill ya boots.

I interpreted that scene (when I heard it) to be more of a disparaging comment about the boy.  The man does not think the boy is fit for the academy (for an unknown reason) and therefore would HAVE to go in the army to become a Time Lord.  

Why is this relevant?  Well (and perhaps this is stretching a bit), what do we know of the Master's experience becoming a Time Lord?  He looked into the time vortex and went mad.  If this boy were the Master instead of the Doctor, it could very well be that whoever the man is knew he wouldn't hold up to looking into the time vortex, possibly because of some instability in his personality, and thought they would wash him out of the academy first.  Of course, since we are shown the Master looking into the time vortex as a young child, this could even be after the Master has looked into the vortex and his crying is more a result of what he saw there.

What about [this poll](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/scottish-independence/scottish-independence-almost-half-of-no-voters-have-felt-personally-threatened-by-the-yes-campaign-9739038.html) that found 46 per cent of No supporters felt personally threatened by the Yes campaign, as opposed to 24 percent of Yes voters who had felt threatened? Maybe that MP wasn't talking shite when he said the organised mobs of Yes voters following him around forced him to cancel his tour.  
  
I googled more information about that scuffle you linked but couldn't find anything, interestingly though I did see a comment on the story on the Glasgow Evening Times site;

&gt;I am an Englishman who has lived in Scotland for 12 years, yet constantly feel threatened due to racial abuse I have received by Yes campaigners. One told me I was an immigrant and they didn't want my vote and told to ""go back to my own country"". Scotland is a beautiful country but, accepting, it is not. I am entitled to vote but undecided. I keep my mouth shut my head down and do not talk politics or religion but this current climate caused me great anxiety. I have managed to avoid the sectarian debacle but this current climate ha bought out the sinister side in others.

true,SliqRik,capaldi,Capaldi,"Well, all of the evidence points to it being a young Doctor.  Moffat said we'd find out why the barn was important to The Doctor this season, and the fact that the child used the barn as a retreat when he was crying means it is important to the child.  Everything Clara tells the child becomes a pillar of The Doctor's persona, as does having a father who is trying to force the child into the military despite his wishes.  There are the multiple repeated quotes, including the one I mentioned which is clearly not a paradox, as Clara never heard The Doctor say it.  Clara says the child is going to return to the barn, and she has seen the barn in the future when The Doctor does return, so she would know it was the same barn.  This idea is further supported when she refuses to let The Doctor see the barn.  Occam's razor stipulates that whenever there are competing theories, the one with the fewest assumptions should be considered the most likely.  Your theory requires far more assumptions than the idea that the child was The Doctor.  You are basing your entire theory on the sliver of uncertainty which exists because there is no way they could have definitively told us it was The Doctor without revealing his name.

I'm not sure what you mean with your second point.  Can you please explain why you think the idea of fear being a companion is the same thing as the idea that our shared fears make companions of us all, and, more specifically, why you use that idea to ignore the fact that Clara tells the child something very specific, ""Fear makes companions of us all,"" which she has not heard The Doctor say, and which Hartnell then repeats almost verbatim to Barbara?

If Moffat were looking for a way to introduce another Time Lord, he already has it in Missy.  Clara being the source of the nightmare for The Doctor is a much more concise explanation which, again, requires far fewer assumptions.

You're right, we're all just guessing.  And, Moffat clearly wants to bring us back to a place of uncertainty about The Doctor.  He's said in the past that he was not comfortable with the level of familiarity we Whovians have come to believe we have with the Time Lord known as The Doctor and he wanted to remind us that we really don't know him at all.  My guess is that we'll never actually re-visit this particular point and will be left only with assumptions.  The idea that the child is The Doctor is the best theory because it requires the least of those.

One swallow does not a summer make.

There's a serious longterm trend of decline with Joe, it'll take more than one good performance to reverse that trend.

Besides, last night wasn't actually a flawless performance. I think he largely played well, but there were still flaws in there.

I noticed German TV picked upon this also, from what I read in another forum.

Joe made one great instinctive save from a Muller header, and a good one from a long range Boateng strike that was destined for the bottom corner.

The other saves were regulation ones.

His distribution was characteristically poor however, kicking the ball directly out of play several times straight from a goal kick.

He also fumbled a long range strike that was right at him and spilt it into the path of a, thankfully, offside Bayern player.

He also flapped at several crosses and corners, and failed to come and collect for a few notable ones.

While he had a good game by and large, the flaws were all still there.

The neutrals can see it, and likewise those who understand the game to a greater depth than merely the standout moments that a child could notice, do also.

We can all have a jibe at those with a different opinion from ourselves.

Doesn't change the fact that you very selectively pick and chose things to highlight to suit your agenda. Next time Joe makes an error or has a poor performance we won't hear a peep from the likes of yourself.

I'm fair and balanced with both my criticisms and praise.

And you'd know that if you read my assessment of his performance last night.

When the TARDIS takes The Doctor to Orson, he is simply looking for any possible connection related to Clara's timeline.

Again, the most likely explanation is that the TARDIS takes them to the point at which The Doctor first experienced the dream, just as it did with Rupert/Danny.

Using your America example, Washington DC is the capital and government centre, New York is the ""finance capital"", Orlando has the most tourists visit.

If a conscious effort way made to shift some of the focus away from London, then perhaps long-term that would help lessen the dominance that London has over the UK economically. Let's say the government decides that Manchester is going to be the UK's answer to Silicon Valley, and puts loads of investment into building up a hive of high-tech industry there. Perhaps relocate the government to some fit-for-the-21st century buildings in Leeds.

 [**Welsh independence**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh%20independence): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Welsh independence__ ([Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language): *Annibyniaeth i Gymru*) is a political ideal advocated by some people in [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales) that would see Wales [secede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secede) from the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) and become an independent [sovereign state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state). This ideology is promoted mainly by the [Welsh nationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_nationalism) party, [Plaid Cymru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaid_Cymru).

I didn't really have to work for it, if I'm honest, as I just really nailed essay writing. I had a good professor in the first year, and wrote my first first class essay for him. He told me 'this is a blueprint for getting a first' and so I really looked at how I wrote that essay, in terms of structure and argument and I just kept getting firsts, and my dissertation was a piece of piss as I'd really got into the swing of it by then. 

It didn't start that well, mind... I got a 58 for my first essay, and was so disheartened. I just kept grinding and it finally clicked at the end of my first year. 

BUT my advice would be, if someone hands you a guide to how your essays are marked, READ IT. You can lose marks because you don't reference properly. It's not necessarily all about your ideas. 

Also, don't just read and reference what's on your reading list. Try to reference at least 3 or 4 works which are not on the reading list. This also impresses (as long as they're relevant).

true,sad_violin,lfc12,,"The real problem is that teams know to mark the fuck out of him and press him out of games now. The real solution would be having him come deeper into the midfield so that he can penetrate and run from deep while also using his vision to pick out attackers. He does not have the strength to hold of midfielders and defenders in the BPL, he needs to be played in a deeper position so that defenders can't always be pressing him. 

In the beginning, when teams were unaware of him or just thought he was all hype, he would get a lot more space. Those days are over and he has to earn every inch of space he can. I believe in him, but I think Rogers needs to give him more opportunities to succeed in a slightly altered midfield role.

I offered you a grape vine in that thread and you threw it back in my face, and even had the temerity to lie about the above quote.

This is an interesting article explaining them. If you don't have the time to read it, then the short answer is that trackers are tools used by companies that track all of your internet activity; what sites you visit, what things you download, what things you search for and buy off Amazon etc. 

The information gathered is then sold off to other companies who use it  for their own means, like Market Research, targeted advertising etc.
Best example of this is that if you searched or bought something like the boxset of Game of Thrones, then the next Amazon ad you get from a random webpage will tell you about things related to Game of Thrones, like the book series.

Ghostery is an add on that shows you trackers and allows you to disable them. I use it because I think this kind of tracking is going too far in terms of privacy. Right now, Reddit has 2 trackers (tracking me at least); Adzerk - an advertising company, and Google Analytics - which is Data gathering.",0,1411074391,null,0,false,0,ckm5erh,t3_2gqwha,t1_ckm5erh,t1_ckm4m66,null,1426937790,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,michaelisnotginger,null,null,"Impressed by Stones. Jagielka was better. Baines and Coleman were immense. Barry and McCarthy got chased out the game a bit but McCarthy was back to his last season form in his closing down and tackling. 

Lukaku was alright. Not brilliant but alright. Several times he'd made the run between the defenders and McGeady or Mirallas would pick another person. I thought Eto'o was good as well and showed great positional awareness.

Everton's still main problem is that the spine becomes disconnected - the lack of a true box-to-box shuttler like Barkley (Naismith was good in the first half dropping deeper but he's not that role) did mean Wolfsburg could press at will at the start of the first and most of the second half. When Barkley comes back I think it will be better. I also think a front midfield three of McGeady - Naismith - Mirallas doesn't have a lot of solidity to it - Mirallas was good at tracking back but I thought McGeady was wasteful and tired from 70mins onwards. 

When Gibson came on there was much more of a focal point to the counter attacks and it's no coincidence there were 3-4 good counter attacks that led to the Mirallas goal. 

For the Palace game I really  really think that the line up played today would be insufficient - Palace are going to pack the box and Lukaku won't be able to run like he normally does. More defensive solidity at the centre to take on Jedinak. I would go Naismith-Eto'o with Lukaku on at the 60min mark.

1. Alcohol is your friend. This doesn't mean drinking every night, getting wasted and throwing up in nightclub toilets. What I mean is twofold: for starters it's a social lubricant - ""Wanna chat over a pint?"" is standard nomenclature at uni. It makes talking easier and makes you more open. It did for me anyway. It also allows you to meet like-minded people - real ale drinker? There's a society for that. Spirits? Society. Cocktails? Society. Which leads me on to number 2.

2. Societies. Join them. No, you won't keep up with them all; yes, the taster sessions all clash and it's when you're meant to be phoning your mum, but they are there for like-minded people, and often it's more about the social aspect than the hobby itself. Not a society that suits you? Create one! Become the President, Treasurer or Social Secretary of a society - looks good on your CV and gives you responsibilities that foster life skills.

3. First year. Talk to any second year and they'll say ""I wish I took advantage more of Freshers"". I got 70% in my first year. What good has that done me now? In terms of pure numbers, nothing! 40% is all most of you will need. The caveat with this is to follow.

4. GO TO YOUR LECTURES. That is your bear minimum. You're now paying £9000 a year, the least you can do is drag your hungover arse out of bed each day to go to your lectures. In first year especially, regurgitating your lectures will get you a 2:2. It won't get you a 2:1, that requires extra reading, which leads me on to...

5. Reading. Maybe more for social sciences, humanities and the arts, but first year, most of the time, 'reading' consists of name dropping peoples names. Maybe open an essay with a quote. If you can reference, or learn to reference, you'll be ahead of 20-30% of your peers already. Read the abstract of the papers. That'll be fine, to be honest.

6. Just enjoy. Seriously. Try not to find reasons to be a cunt. People will annoy you, lectures will be boring, you will get hungover, bouncers will be dickheads. But after all of this, you'll be left with some of the best years of your life, with friends that might last your for many years.

And finally

7. If everyone around you seems to be a dickhead, chances are, you're the dickhead. Stop being a dickhead, dickhead!",0,1411075119,null,0,false,0,ckm5s55,t3_2grc9c,t1_ckm5s55,t3_2grc9c,null,1426937617,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,agentdcf,flair8,,"Your guest was right on about getting a point in Belgrade being a good outcome. We had some poor performances out there, but we should keep in mind that that match was as difficult as one at this stage of the competition can get: poor pitch, hostile crowd, and an opposing team that was both competent and up for it. Under those circumstances, a draw is fine. Obviously you want to see a victory, but I'm not upset about the outcome at all.

As for the talk about selling our souls to win things, I'm definitely in the ""keep dirty, corrupt money away,"" but I think it's a false dichotomy. The fact that clubs like City and Chelsea have billionaire backing does not make it inevitable that they'll win, any more than does United's money. Spurs have a set of essential ingredients in place or nearly so, and I'm pretty optimistic that an alternative business model os possible. 

A new stadium will increase matchday revenues. The academy, training facility, and investments in scouting and youth development suggest that we should be able to develop more than our share of young players. These young players can be sold at a profit or play their way into first team; if the former, we have another revenue stream, and if the latter we get players who will be on lower wages (because they're younger and will not have earned larger contracts at that point) that someone of comparable skill purchased on the transfer market. And, because Spurs are a London based club with a good history, I think they will develop a bigger non-English fanbase than a lot of other clubs. 

All this adds up to a club that probably cannot compete with City or Chelsea in raw spending power, but that should be able to put together solid, competitive teams with a sustainable and franky ethical business model. You don't need someone dumping an endless stream of oil money into your club to win. 

And, who wants to be a club that wins all tbe time? Fans of those clubs are miserable. They feel entitled to win, and thus winning merely matches their expectations. That's as good as it ever gets for them, and much of the time tey walk away disappointed and miserable.

You say you're all about City but where's the romance? Every time I read one of your Hart posts you make it as black and white as casting him aside and buying Neuer or someone, like the efficient business we are. Like buying one of the twenty 'keepers better than him will fix us and make us a European powerhouse. 

This is a player who has served us well ""when we were shit"" and is still more than capable of doing so with good competition. I thought he was top notch last night. You can criticise his distribution all you like but it doesn't mask the fact he kept us in the game longer than we deserved.

It really pisses me off seeing you constantly condemn the guy who remains one of the few links to City from the fans. Maybe I'm over romantic in that sense.

No doubt he's had a few too many blunders but I would be so disillusioned if we got rid of him. He's not like Meeks who's injuries caused him to fall of the face of the earth and could no longer depend on his physicality. He's not like Swp who got fat and lazy. He's England's #1 - he's one of the few Englishman at our club. Not only do we need him to even compete in the English league there are very few better to replace him.

true,dragontiers,null,null,"I hope you don't mind if I use bullet points again.  I just find it easier to make sure I've clearly discussed your points.

1) The barn:  If we are to see why the barn is so important to the Doctor, I would expect a bit more than just this scene.  Yes, this scene will definitely play a part in the explanation, but I for one would feel disappointed if all we got was ""he used it as a place to hide when he didn't want the other boys to see him cry.""  If I were a betting man, I'd put money on us seeing more, and there is plenty of room to play around in right now.

2) Everything Clara tells the child becomes a pillar of the Doctor's personality:  The Doctor, and his companions, have spread messages such as this all over the galaxy.  In fact, in just this episode they told Rupert Pink something pretty close.  The fact that a companion of the Doctor is telling a child something that the Doctor believes does not prove anything.  If it is the Doctor, it ties it up nicely, but that is all.  Likewise, the fact Clara thinks she is talking to the Doctor is not proof either.  She has made an assumption that could be played out to be wrong.

3) Clara never heard the Doctor use that quote, so it's not a paradox:  Clara heard the Doctor (specifically the quote above) &gt; Clara paraphrases the quote to the younger Doctor &gt; the Doctor paraphrases the quote many times over his life, including the one he told Clara and the one he told Barbara.  This is a loop without a beginning, and thus a paradox.  Like I said though, little paradoxes such as this happen all the time in Doctor Who though, so it isn't really a relevant issue.

4) Clara tells the child he will return to the barn: This only indicates that Clara believes the child to be the Doctor, not that the child actually is the Doctor.  This has no weight on the true identity of the boy.

5)Occam's razor: I'm not sure of the best way to say this, but we are discussing Doctor Who.  Occam's Razor is not really relevant.  Almost every episode follows a pattern of ""mysterious happenings that could be described by normal conventions but have a supernatural origin"".  Is that earthquake caused by lizard people hiding in the center of the earth or the tectonic plates moving?  Are those bodies spontaneously combusting, or is a robot from the future stuck in the past harvesting organic components to repair his ship so he can find the promise land?  Did his three best friends witness the Doctor die by a lake, or was he really shrunk down to miniature sized inside a machine that looks identical to him so he can fake his own death and erase all evidence of his existence from the universe? Occam's razor has no edge in the Whoverse.

6) Explaining the quote:  Early in the episode, the doctor describes to Clara what they are looking for as a ""companion"" with us all our lives.  By the end of the episode, it is clear Clara believes there is no ""companion"", only simple, primal fear.  She takes some of what the Doctor told her with her realization that it was only fear, and uses it to try and reassure the child.  Hence ""You’re always gonna be afraid even if you learn to hide it. Fear is like a companion, a constant companion, always there.""  Additionally, as I explained to xporkiepiex above, it is likely that if the child is not the Doctor, then it is someone the Doctor knew, and could very well have heard it from them, much the way Barbara heard it from the Doctor.  I am not sure where ""shared fears make companions of us all"" comes from, so I don't know how to refute that.

7) Introducing another Time Lord:  While it is possible from my theory that this could be a new Time Lord we are not aware of, I am not arguing for that case directly.  This scene could easily be played up later as part of a motivating force for the Master, or Missy (if she turns out to be a Time Lord and isn't also the Master as some are guessing).  It could even be used in bringing back another Time Lord from Old Who such as the Ranni, although again that could be tied in with Missy as well.  Who the actual Time Lord is that Clara talks to is the flexible part of this theory.

It is entirely possible (perhaps even probable) that we never do revisit this scene, and I am putting too much stress on it.  If that happens, then I fully accept that the boy was in fact the Doctor.  However, it just feels like the writers left enough room in this scene to use it as a big surprise plot point later.  And that is why I love this show so much.",0,1411076063,null,0,false,0,ckm69hx,t3_2gpfi0,t1_ckm69hx,t1_ckm3isc,null,1426937392,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,Baggzio,newcr-1,You Signed Lambert We Signed No One At All!!,"This was amazing!! I felt we didn't even give it everything after 2-0 up and it was phenomenal to watch!

 Howard was superb and showed why he's still one of the best. Made some amazing saves and in fairness didn't deserve to be beaten at all.

Seamus and Leighton were great also especially Bainesy with his goal and 2 assists! Jags looked the player he really is tonight and looked really good (we'll forget about that pass back that went to a corner ;) ) and Stones looked to have in my opinion anyway cemented his place in the starting XI now and honestly would be surprised if he's benched once Distin is fit again. 

Barry played well and had good passes while making a good presence in the middle and McCarthy was immense and surely put his few doubters to rest tonight. Both were also great for covering Seamus and Bainesy when they ventured forward.

Mirallas great also looks a complete different player from last season, much more a team player now. McGeady looking better in every game for me even though he does get sloppy later in games but that's why we'd have Atsu/Pienaar to sub on if he got sloppier also thinks he's made that winger spot his own and again would be surprised if Pienaar got it back without some really great work and bad work from Aiden. 

Naisy, need I say more, the man has been a revelation this last 12 months and I'll admit I was one of his doubters but he's now one of my favourite players because he's one the most reliable. Rom's overall play has definitely improved and looks a much better player than last year already just needs to get his shooting boots back on. You can see he's learning loads from Eto'o's influence already. 

Speaking of Eto'o again from the subs he made a good impact on the game when he came on and had some great play and possession, really enjoyable that's he's ours!! Also great to see Gibbo finally back, might be tough to crack the starting XI but he'll still be very important to us this season and Ossie well he didn't have much time to do anything buts it's nice to have an academy lad playing in the big games after all the years and signings if anything.

All in all it was fantastic to watch and really made me optimistic about us this year in Europe, that was probably our toughest opposition in the group and we trampled them as if they were nothing. Have to say though their Rodriguez lad was class, really looked like their only option and in fairness his free at the end was great even though Tim didn't deserve to be beaten. 

Also I know this is a bit random but I think it could be a small blessing in disguise that Ross got injured. Don't take this the wrong way I was gutted when he was ruled out and still am but think about it, if he hadn't been injured we'd have never seen Naisy like this and be so influencial and this is great because it means we don't have to rush Ross back until he's absolutely 100% or the derby because he won't want to miss that if he doesn't have to and also it will mean that Ross with have to really fight for his place back off Naisy when he's fit again and that can only make him a better player after all.

Europe swooped in, claimed already occupied land, took control of all the natives, and then ordered them around for a few centuries. Remember the [Rwandan Genocide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Genocide) in 1994? That happened because the Europeans took the Hutus and Tutsis (two African ethnic groups) and stuck them together like it wasn't a big deal. This caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people. In fact most of the civil wars going on in Africa at this time can be attributed to the effects of European Imperialism.

So yeah I don't think we need a resurgence of colonialism, because I have no reason to believe that we have learned our lesson. We can even see something similar happening with Iraq.

&gt;The __Rwandan Genocide__ was a [genocidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide) [mass slaughter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_murder) of [Tutsi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutsi) and moderate [Hutu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutu) in [Rwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda) by members of the Hutu majority. During the approximate 100-day period from April 7, 1994 to mid-July, an estimated 500,000–1,000,000 Rwandans were killed,  constituting as much as 20% of the country's total population and 70% of the Tutsi then living in Rwanda. The genocide was planned by members of the core political elite known as the *[akazu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akazu)*, many of whom occupied positions at top levels of the national government. Perpetrators came from the ranks of the Rwandan army, the National Police (*gendarmerie*), government-backed militias including the *[Interahamwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interahamwe)* and *[Impuzamugambi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impuzamugambi)*, and the Hutu civilian population.

If you'll allow me a little digression on Barkley...

Barkley is one of the most integral components of Everton's team. But he would be of any team. His central strength is his link-up skill with Lukaku and his creativity. He's not the floating elfin No.10s (silva/Mata/Ozil) that are in vogue - his power comes from his running, his fearlessness etc - in that regard he reminds me of Gascoigne, Yaya Toure - even Schweinsteiger and Baggio. Everton's DMs give him the luxury of not tracking back as much as would be demanded in say a Mourinho starting 11, and so mean that counter attacking fluid football that Martinez demands is much more available. What he is yet to add to his game is the constant chance creation that is necessary of a No.10, as that's the role he likes to play, and he can be selfish. That's partly why he's been limited to Super subs. But I genuinely believe he's one of the brightest talents in English football right now because I can't think of many young midfielders who occupy that central space as effortlessly as he does (maybe Sterling though he's really a winger, and, at a push, Will Hughes)",0,1411076334,null,0,false,0,ckm6eit,t3_2gsr2z,t1_ckm6eit,t1_ckm600w,null,1426937327,3,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,3

true,SliqRik,capaldi,Capaldi,"""Fear makes companions of us all,"" is not a paraphrase of ""What if it’s not you you’re talking to. Proposition – What if no one is ever really alone? What if every single living being has a companion, a silent passenger? A shadow. What if the prickle on the back of your neck is the breath of something close behind you?""  It is an entirely separate idea that our fears connect us, this idea does not depend on the idea that people have fear, or that their fear is a companion.

The images I shared prove it is the same barn.  Are you suggesting The Doctor chose that barn at random in *The Day of the Doctor*?  That would contradict Moffat telling us we would discover why the barn was important to The Doctor.

None of the mysterious things which happen in Doctor Who have a supernatural origin.  Every explanation we have received is based in natural science, even if it is science which was previously unknown, it is not supernatural.  Even the ""witches"" in *The Shakespeare Code* were simply using a science unknown to most other species, which those species thought of as magic.  The true pattern is: something strange happens, some people sometimes think there is a supernatural origin, The Doctor reveals the origin to be based on natural science.  Occam's razor is quite sharp in the Whoverse, in my opinion.  The Doctor, in fact, always seems to operate by it and only changes his course when new factual or logical evidence comes to light.

I really think you're seeing space where there isn't really any.  But, we'll see.  In any case, thanks for the interesting discussion.

- Don't try and do everything all at once. Pick a few societies, choose the one or two that you like and stick to them.

- Don't be afraid of asking people out. The worst they're going to say is no. 

- Learn to cook. Jamie Oliver [has some excellent basic lessons here](http://www.jamieshomecookingskills.com/about.php), and the BBC has lots of good free recipes.

- Study. Seriously. It's so easy to get distracted by everything else, skip lectures, fall behind. Study, seriously.

- Enjoy yourself. Kiss lots of boys/girls.

I said this the other day to Saul, but forums like this often serve as an avenue to vent your frustrations after a game or on a particular topic that's bugging you, it's not always an accurate reflection of your wider character.

I've never once stated we should just bin Joe on a whim and simply buy Neuer or any other top goalkeeper, that's nonsense. As if it's even that simple. That's a really considerable misrepresentation of my position.

I've been completely frank with my opinion on this topic, I've been balanced and written my opinion in depth. If you wish to know precisely how I feel you can have a look at the previous threads on the topic.

You see Joe as one of the few links left to the fans?

Sorry mate, but do you speak from a position of knowledge on this topic? Are you even in the UK, let alone Manchester?

Frankly, I don't care if me giving a sincere opinion on him pisses you off. I've made it very clear why I feel the way I do. I'm entitled to my opinion, as are you.

That said, frankly, I do think you're looking at this too subjectively. You need to take the blinkers off mate.

I always put City ahead of individual players. Some players I like more than others, and as a result I'm likely to be more patient with them than others. Human nature, but I try my best to ignore sentiment when analysing a player's qualities. There's a multitude of different things which make me consider someone's value to the club.

Their quality is the first and foremost.

If sentiment ruled above all else Micah would still be here and we'd never have signed Sagna.

I think some of our foreign blues, or newer fans, need to realise that valid criticism of a player doesn't make you less of a supporter.

As for why the military would receive Time Lord training, wouldn't it make sense for your military to be able use Time Lord abilities?

Wouldn't you want your armed forces to have these options?  Regeneration means they can keep fighting for longer and through more dangerous scenarios.  Time travel means they can fight their enemy before their enemy becomes too much of a threat.

Yes. Statistical theory allows us to estimate this. Imagine a country that divides exactly equally on some issue — 50% hold one view while the other 50% think the opposite. Statistical theory tells us that, in a random poll of 1,000 people, with a 100% response rate, then 19 times out of 20, a poll will be accurate to within 3%. In other words, it will record at least 47%, and no more than 53%, for each view. But there is a one in 20 chance that the poll will fall outside this range.
With a sample of 2,000, the poll will be within 2% 19 times out of 20.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"It will be a tactical decision between the two, Barkley will play probably 65% of games in the hole though I feel because he offers a bit more, and Naismith will offer a bit more off the bench. 

What Barkley does is something very special- he may not have the eye for goal, or the persistent rat like closing down that Naismith provides, but he is a linkup man of stunning quality. 

We struggle in two areas without Barkley in the team- firstly in the transition between defense and attack, and secondly we struggle getting balls through the middle to the striker. I will try and expand on both of those:

Transition: Because we rely largely on a slow build up, our players are more fine tuned for that approach. If the opposition has a corner, and it gets cleared, the players who are looking to start an attack are lads who are very good on the ball, but not exactly devastating. 

The standard approach when Naismith plays is to either try and find one of our attackers with a long ball (which will usually be Naismith, as Lukaku defends corners in the box), or hold up play before one of the wingers or wing backs starts up make an overlapping run up the pitch. 

This approach is fine, but Naismith is hardly equipped to receive long balls due to his size, and waiting for the overlap gives their defenders another 10 seconds or so to get back in position. 

What Barkley does in this transitional position is offer the ability to drive the ball forward, and pick out passes whilst belting toward the defenders at full speed. This *really* throws defenses off, and doesn't give them time to hold a shape, allowing our runners to receive the ball far higher up the pitch where they are much more deadly (Baines because his first time ball is stunning, and Coleman, Mira and Aidey because they love to take on defenders).

---

Secondly, he is very, very good at making tricky balls work down the middle. 

One thing that Naismith lacks, is a real deadly passing range. We have seen it in a few games this season where we have just struggled for ideas in the final third- we are passing it around for fun. Leicester for example- we completed 104 passes in the final third, yet only made 6 chances (all from the left wing, nothing down the middle), this was the third highest final third passes in the league, yet only 4 teams made fewer chances. This season only 13.9% of out chances have been created down the middle, putting by by far the lowest team in the league, second is Sunderland with 21.2%- exploiting the flanks is one thing, but there is a point where it becomes one dimensional and predictable.

When we have a player like Lukaku up top, we need to be delivering him the balls down the middle. He is a deceptive player- people look at him and think 'target man', but infact he is in reality a traditional fast striker. This means lumping the ball up to him, or even crossing onto his noggin are not going to pay dues- picking out his runs, and delivering a well  timed ball that beats the offside trap are what allow him to score, and he is getting none of that service so far. 

If you watch Lukaku play, you will see he constantly makes these runs. It is tough to see on a TV set, as they tend to cut out that bit of the action, but if you can ever get an interactive service with a player cam (or a flight to Liverpool!), I implore you to watch his movement and change of pace. 

We saw last season that if Romo gets goalside of a defenders, and the ball comes to him then it is game over. He is faster than pretty much any centreback, and even if they are quicker than him, he will shield the ball and turn into the fucking juggernaut before leathering at the keeper. 

---

Barkley will score wondergoals, his technique is just amazing and his confidence in taking players on is brutal- but he hasn't developed the scrappy eye for a shitty goal that Naismith has in his locker. There are times when we will need to tempo and outlet for goals that Naismith brings to proceedings, and there are times when we need that extra option in the transition and the link up with Lukaku is required. 

I get the feeling that Eto will start more with Naismith, and Lukaku will start more with Barkley as they compliment each other better (Naismith and Eto will switch positions more naturally), however Lukaku and Eto will be a lot of fun if that gets going.",0,1411078586,null,0,false,0,ckm7ieh,t3_2gshsf,t1_ckm7ieh,t1_ckm3a0z,null,1426936813,27,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,27

true,dragontiers,null,null,"""Fear makes companions of us all"" may not be a paraphrase, but ""Fear is like a companion, a constant companion, always there"" is a paraphrase if you simply make fear the thing the quote is asking about.  You are never alone because fear is with you.  Fear is every living beings companion, their silent passenger.  Fear is the shadow.  The prickle on the back of your neck is fears breath.  I think we were just splitting hairs over which quote we were referring to.

I am not claiming the Doctor chose the barn at random.  Instead, I think it is possible the barn holds a different meaning for him other than he just used it as a place to run to when he didn't want the others to see him cry.  If my theory is correct (which it may not be), instead it could be a place he connected with whoever that boy was.  It could be a shared secret between the two, a meeting place, a place where they grew closer together.  To me, that would give it more meaning than a spot to hide.

Supernatural was a poor choice of words.  Extraterrestrial would be better. Sure, Doctor Who uses science we are not aware of, but that very science goes against Occam's Razor.  Can you honestly tell me that you believe that (to use your example) 'creatures from another dimension needed him to say a specific set of phrases in order to free other creatures to come into our world, and when their plan was thwarted it destroyed the only copy of that play in existence and Shakespeare never did the play again' is a simpler explanation than 'copies were not well preserved and were lost over time' or 'it was retitled as one of his other plays such as *Much Ado About Nothing*'?  Doctor Who thrives on the less likely explanation.

I freely admit I am working my theory in a tight space, but I believe the writers have worked in tighter ones.  Remember when the Doctor lost his coat, then had it, then lost it again in while running from the weeping angels?  Most simply considered it a consistency error, but it turned out to be a plot point later.  This probably isn't that big, but I think there is room to maneuver.

---

&gt;Some Jewish and non-Jewish fans of [Tottenham Hotspur F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.) adopted ""Yid"" (or ""Yiddo"") as a [nickname](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickname) and ""Yiddo, Yiddo!"" as a [battle cry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_cry) and often identify themselves as ""Yid Army"". While such usage remains controversial, for the overwhelming majority of Tottenham supporters, it is used with pride.  Some Jewish Tottenham supporters use it with a political consciousness of the club as a bastion against racism and antisemitism. Others use it simply because many of the fans and owners of the club are Jews. However, the name was first given to the supporters as an insult, due to the large Jewish following at the club. This following started in the 1890s and 1900s when the club was the team of choice for ""East-enders"" - including large numbers of Jewish immigrants - who could easily get cheap buses and trams to Tottenham, heading north along the road later designated the A10. East-end Jews have mostly moved to the north and east London suburbs and Herts and Essex, but support for Tottenham Hotspur continues to run in families (a famous example is [Alan Sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sugar)). For visiting teams' supporters the Jewish connection continues to be bolstered by the large numbers of - easily identifiable - Hassidic Orthodox Jews living in South Tottenham and Stamford Hill; but in practice there is no evidence of Hassidic Jews attending football matches. Nevertheless, you do not have to be Hassidic to be Jewish, and Spurs still has a strong Jewish fanbase.

true,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"It's a tough one to call. Both teams are difficult to predict of late, I notice.

I think Arsenal's midfield seems to be misfiring, and with a high-pressure game from our boys similar to the one against Liverpool... we might manage to keep them out entirely. Especially given that Welbeck hasn't looked particularly good for them so far when they've managed to get the ball to him (now I've said that, he'll score &gt;_&gt;). As always they look a bit fragile at the back too... but if we overcommit, we'll get carved open. Needs to be balance... not sure how to do that to be honest. I'd probably name the same team as we did against Liverpool and hope for an early goal, then focus on limiting supply to Welbeck. As long as the defence doesn't panic under pressure from him, we could nick the win.

Benteke on the bench for psychological reasons maybe (Lambert told the media he won't rush him back, didn't he? Would be a nice little mind-fuck for Wenger, and a boost for the team). Might even ask him to warm up in the 70s. Probably wouldn't bring him on though. No matter what. Too much of a risk, IMO. We need to ease him back in, if we want him at his best (and I suspect we'll need him at his best later in the season, when our early season steam runs out... can't expect the team to play at such high levels, week-in week-out)

Could go either way, but realistically I kind of expect both teams to buck recent form and Arsenal will edge us again, 2-1. I mean... Liverpool sort of played into our hands, whereas Arsenal seem more likely to pull players out of shape. Also, Welbeck is more dogged in hunting the ball than Balotelli is, and even something as simple as that could be a difference maker. Would be nice to go to Stamford Bridge to face the other undefeated team though, and it could happen, I think 1-1 is a reasonable prediction too.",0,1411079432,null,0,false,0,ckm7wyb,t3_2gr5dg,t1_ckm7wyb,t3_2gr5dg,null,1426936621,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

Occasionally, we'd get to see dozens of tanks, and troop carriers etc driving down the road where we lived. We would also hear huge explosions and see the tracer rounds at night. Our house was wooden and built up on stilts. It was actually built elsewhere in the state, then cut in half and transported there on the back of a truck. The whole house felt like it was about to collapse every time the fighter jets would fly down the valley at full speed. I'm surprised that old place is still standing.

One big positive with naismith at the ten is the way he tracks back and helps the team defend when we don't have the ball. He's a determined player, and he isn't afraid to get stuck in and take a yellow if need be. Barkley also tracked back a good deal last year when we didn't have the ball, so I assume that one aspect of the way Martinez wants us to play the game is for the ten to have a lot of defensive responsibility. I'm not convinced if Eto'o can provide that over ninety minutes anymore, so unless he is played as more of a trequartista, he is going to run out of gas really quickly. Now, you could alternate, and on the attack have eto'o in the ten with naismith pushed forward, and once we lose the ball, have naismith track  back and provide the closing down we need in the midfield and leave eto'o higher up the pitch.

true,grotesquelyuglyfreak,flair7,,"&gt; Mugged off - ""mugged off"" by an mls player hardly has anything to do with skill. In America, weights are relied on heavily. I don't know about how players develop regarding strength training in England, but it is a huge part of American sports and culture. Him being pushed off by someone two years older doesn't say that much to me. Yedlin is barely 20 and likely has some growth left in him. Yedlin showed his strength in the World Cup against both Germany and Belgium, both very sizable and strong teams.

You put too much weight into a players physical attributes, a right back needn't be strong to put in a tackle on their winger, they just need to be quick footed, have good positioning and defensive decision making. Strength really is a minor factor for a fullback. Lahm isn't a muscle-monster, he's just your average joe in terms of strength yet he's (one of) the best fullback in the world.

Walker wasn't awful when he returned to here, he made a couple more errors than he makes nowadays  but he established himself in the side that season fairly comfortably.

&gt; Hyped on reddit - reddit is an American site. It's users are predominately American. Yedlin is arguably the biggest prospect for the usmnt. Are you surprised he's hyped here?

He's just saying people need to add some realism to their posts (as OP is doing here). Take a step back and question whether he's the real deal, rather than blindly overstating youth players abilities where it may be unwarranted (a spurs example of this is clearly Townsend).

This post was mostly just me needing to keep reiterating to american fans that physical attributes are not as important as technical ones in this sport. Certainly less than is stated by many of the rcoys family. What is important is positioning and using your weight to protect the ball in intelligent ways.

&gt;

&gt;The __Tito–Stalin Split__, or __Yugoslav–Soviet Split__, was a conflict between the leaders of [Yugoslavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia) and the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union), which resulted in Yugoslavia's expulsion from the Communist Information Bureau ([Cominform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cominform)) in 1948. This was the beginning of the [Informbiro Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informbiro_Period), marked by poor relations with the USSR, that came to an end in 1955.

&gt;It was said by the Soviets to be caused by Yugoslavia's disloyalty to the USSR, while in Yugoslavia and the West it was presented as [Josip Broz Tito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josip_Broz_Tito)'s national pride and refusal to submit to [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin)'s will in making Yugoslavia a Soviet [satellite state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_state). Scholars now emphasize the cause was Stalin's rejection of Tito's plans to absorb Albania and Greece in cooperation with Bulgaria, thereby setting up a powerful Eastern Europe bloc outside Moscow's control.

 The article you linked to suggests that Shetland would own a significant portion of the oil fields, which would certainly be bad for Scotland. It doesn't debunk this in any way.

true,Melberger,null,null,"I've mentioned Willy could replace Joe in the short term, unless he turns his game around massively. If you asked me as of right now, I don't think either are the right answer long term. But that could change.

Caballero though, is an upgrade on Joe in a number of departments. Significantly so in terms of distribution.

There really isn't much between them in terms of shot stopping either, but the stats from last season in fact show that Caballero is superior to Joe in every department besides punching IIRC, including shot stopping.

But the stats showed both are error prone.

I don't think either are the longterm answer at present, and it think it's a problem position for us.

But Caballero deserves his chance.

Fair enough re the position of knowledge point. Just don't feel the same way at all. I interpreted that comment as being out of touch. Saying that though, I got a lot of stick from the lads who I travel to away fixtures with for my criticisms of Joe. So a lot of blues do have that (IMO) blinkered view borne out of sentiment.

They've come round a lot to my position though.

I just don't share the love for Joe simply. We all have players we like more than others. With Joe I see a player who was hungry to impress under Sven, and did well. Got majorly bigged up, Leslie Hughes brought in Given after being sceptical with Joe. He goes on loan to Birmingham, and does well. I still recall his reluctance to come back to City from that loan. Comes back, fights for his place to start ahead of Given, has a stunning game against Spurs on the opening day in 2010/11, and has his best season in a City shirt.

Then, his development stalled. He earned his status as England number one, and had no rival competition for his place at club level or for England.

He began to believe his own hype. He developed a notable arrogance, kind of like old England boys network of Terry, Ashley Cole and co in the England squad.

He didn't work on his weaknesses, and it appears he thought he made it.

Then, it was all rapidly downhill. He began a rapid decline in 2012, and hasn't looked anything like the keeper he did in 2010/11.

I don't think he's the most professional of players, and I don't particularly like his attitude. He's not a City fan, he's not even an academy product.

I just don't see him anyway like the way I see Kompany or Zabaleta, or Micah, or going back a bit, SWP.

And ultimately, I don't think he's become the keeper we hoped he would. And I don't think he will.

At present, I don't think he makes the grade at City. Not too dissimilar to Micah.

And everyone knows that Micah's position had become untenable, and it was the right call to replace him.

I think we'll eventually come to the same conclusion with Joe.",0,1411082359,null,0,false,0,ckm99b1,t3_2grnht,t1_ckm99b1,t1_ckm8bm7,null,1426935994,0,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,0

I'm worried about how much funding for Scottish charity will fall, as I cannot see it maintaing the same level in an independent Scotland. It is very worrying for my step-mother as she cares deeply about the charity however it is not swaying my family from across the way from voting YES.

For those interested
&gt;Scottish research institutions receive funding from a number of UK-wide and external sources, including UK Research Councils, government departments, EU funding programmes, business (including foreign direct investment) and charities. Such funding can be significant – for example in areas such as healthcare and medical research.
The UK Research Councils play a central role in the UK’s – including Scotland’s – world-class reputation for research and established research infrastructure. Within a competitive UK research environment, Scotland has been very successful in securing UK Research Council funding; Scottish Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) secured £257 million of Research Council grants (excluding Research Council institutes and infrastructure) in 2012-13. This represents 13.1 per cent of the UK total, significantly more than its 8 per cent of UK GDP, or 8.4 per cent of the UK population. Including all Research Council funding (including grants, studentships and fellowships and spending on infrastructure), Scotland secured £307 million (10.7 per cent of the UK total).
In the event of a vote in favour of independence, the UK’s current research and innovation system would operate in the continuing UK. Although Research Councils do support international projects, they generally only provide funding to researchers in UK institutions taking part in collaborations with international partners. It would be up to an independent Scotland to fund any partners from Scottish institutions.

I know this is an in-depth document however this has defiantly been overlooked in the media and debates, it's sickening to hear both Camps ramble on about caring for their nation or the 'unions' family and ignoring paramount issues such as funding for charities that saves and changes lives. If they really want what is best for their nation or union, for goodness sake they should have address issues that don't just appeal to the largest amount of Scots in order to gain votes but should have addressed real issues like this one, ones that really can have detriment affects on someones livelihood if not resolved.

All it shows is how much entrenched power they really have. That's what has disappointed me the most. Now there's nothing at all that will stop the big three or at best an outside cuntish party like UKIP.

Come on, a thrown egg isn't an ""attack"". I've listed a bunch of other incidents far more severe in [this post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2gqt7w/voting_begins_in_scottish_referendum/ckm8xyu). Finding those links wasn't particularly easy. 

&gt; And you know, let's be fair, the guy who egged the MP was a pro-independence supporter. 

As are all of the people in the previously linked comment. And as were the BNP causing trouble in George Square last night, I'd be surprised if they didn't kick off tonight as well, some friends have already mentioned seeing a few arrests in the city. 

If you point out these guys as ""pro-union"" you get crucified on this sub. This thread is thankfully old enough now that I won't be buried for saying it. 

&gt; Maybe that MP wasn't talking shite when he said the organised mobs of Yes voters following him around forced him to cancel his tour. 

Apparently there was a facebook post that encouraged others to follow him, sounded like a one-off though as opposed to people following him around.

The thing is, Jim Murphy shouts and heckles people all the time, it's his style. See [this interview for example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Upf_L9jRnvg), it gets worse and worse until it's completely out of control by the end. So he really has a cheek to bitch about it. If you stand in the street and shout at people in Scotland they will shout back. Watching the US evangelists that come over can be quite funny, they aren't used to it at all. Same with entertainers like stand up comics, Glasgow is seen as one of the toughest crowds, if they like you they'll love you but if they hate you *will* get heckled. I'm betting you've seen the Stewart Lee clip where he's ripping on Braveheart? That was recorded in Glasgow and they loved it. 

&gt; What about this poll[1] that found 46 per cent of No supporters felt personally threatened by the Yes campaign, as opposed to 24 percent of Yes voters who had felt threatened? 

Without context that is meaningless. What does ""personally threatened"" mean? Could be a threat to your beliefs, your love for your country or for your personal safety. Perhaps the actual poll question was clearer but there's no information on that at all. That's normally a sign of bad reporting, if it is fully legitimate. There's a famous poll that gets banded around on stormfront copypasta on /r/worldnews etc that claims ""X% of Muslims would kill for their religion"" but the actual question posted was something like ""If you and your religion was being attacked by others would you kill to defend it"". Lies, damn lies and statistics. 

I'd agree that there has been a culture of arguing back. Many ""no"" voters I know have complained about Facebook/Twitter where they post a pro-union sentiment and get many links to counter articles in response. Typical reddit fare but I guess many people aren't used to it. As for people feeling physically threatened? I'm not convinced but I'd assume there have at least been a handful of incidents. 

WRT to the English guy you quote at the end, it could be true but it's not normal. English folk are kicking about here all the time with no issues. I work with a lot of English companies &amp; go out for meals &amp; drinks with them, I've never in my life seen any problems.

&gt;The British government has decriminalised online video game, music and movie piracy, scrapping fuller punishment plans after branding them unworkable.


&gt;Starting in 2015, persistent file-sharers will be sent four warning letters explaining their actions are illegal, but if the notes are ignored no further action will be taken.

&gt;The scheme, named the Voluntary Copyright Alert Programme (VCAP), is the result of years of talks between ISPs, British politicians and the movie and music industries.

&gt;The UK’s biggest providers – BT, TalkTalk, Virgin and Sky – have all signed up to VCAP, and smaller ISPs are expected to follow suit.

&gt;VCAP replaces planned anti-piracy measures that included cutting users’ internet connections and creating a database of file-sharers.

&gt;Geoff Taylor, chief executive of music trade body the BPI, said VCAP was about “persuading the persuadable, such as parents who do not know what is going on with their net connection.”

&gt;He added: “VCAP is not about denying access to the internet. It’s about changing attitudes and raising awareness so people can make the right choice.”

&gt;Officials will still work to close and stem funding to file-sharing sites, but the news appears to mean that the British authorities have abandoned legal enforcement of online media piracy.

&gt;Figures recently published by Ofcom said that nearly a quarter of all UK downlaods were of pirated content.

true,ZOIDO,null,null,"Ohhhhh snap, you've opened up a whole can of worms for me then! And I don't want to think I know you as a 'pretty Tory' person... But I lived with someone pro tory before. Lovely person who I admire for having an opinion on politics and not just the Kardasians. However I feel with the modern world and definitely the stereotypical tory upbringing that you assess every detail of your performance and the people around you with wealth in terms of money and things that are mainly face value... Not you personally, but in general I feel that people who are obsessive with money and wealth are usually depressed individuals unless they are sociopathical - would sell their children to make money and not care. 

The Royal Mail, again I'm not sure where you live, was a fantastic service which I loved and admired as a British government lead organisation and one the tax payer helped to build. - but rurally it ticked all the boxes and from my experience did brilliantly to give equal measures nationwide... This however isn't a 'making money' model and one Londoners especially would hate as they don't live outside of the city bubble (on a day to day basis)...

And so above kind of highlights my pure annoyance at today's society in Briton. Privatisation doesn't work for the majority of the country and only works for the few, as has been proven again and again. 

And before you say... But Labour... Yep! Blair brought in the foundations to dismantle the NHS to private firms and this is why we see an increase in 'debt' and 'the NHS isn't working cos it's in debt'. In debt to private firms Blair setup almost seemingly to line his own? 

Also going back to my initial 'US cock' comment... The US government got Thatcher to shut down a well run heroin clinic in London. We're but a 51st state, and I live in the 52nd because I don't live in the London bubble of economics.

&gt;How do you guys primarily get around?

You are well within walking distance to the city centre. Probably a 10-15 minute walk, and walking is safe almost everywhere in Oxford. If you are super lazy you can bus which will cost you maybe £1.50 into the centre and up to £3 for anywhere else within Oxford. Also cycling is really the best way to get around and you can pick up a bike for £20- as much as you want.

&gt;Any restaurants etc to recommend / check out?

No tips on the Keto front. Nando's is decent if you've not been before. Gourmet burger kitchen is great. Jamie's (as in Jamie Oliver) is decent. All of these places are in the centre.

&gt;I want to use this opportunity to develop some hobbies etc.

It will almost definitely be doable through your Uni/school. If not the dailyinfo will help out.

&gt;I assume its mostly pub culture in Oxford? What about night clubs and stuff? How late are pubs (and other things like grocery stores) open?

Pubs generally close around 11-12 most nights, Bars 12-1, Clubs 2-3. There will be *a* club open every night of the week, but some clubs only open on weekends. Shops (clothes, electronics, etc) are open till 5-6 (less on sundays). Supermarkets will vary but generally open till 9-11.  Grocery stores will vary as well, big ones will probably close by 9 but ""Corner shops"" are generally open till 9-12 (very small family owned shops that sell cigarettes,alcohol, sweets, and some food.).

&gt;As I'm moving to Uni there I think I'll have to do a run to buy sheets, towels, laundry hamper etc - all the college goodies. Any recommendations of where to buy this?

There are lots of large stores that will sell this kind of thing. I'd have a look at temple cowley retail park as you'll probably be able to pick up those kind of things there. If not the larger tescos/sainsbury's on the ring road will probably have them.

&gt;I'm not quite sure how to phrase this but I bank with HSBC, are ATMs widely accessible?

ATMs are near shops normally and there are plenty of them. You can also use any bank ATMs, regardless of which bank you bank with. (also you can pay with a debit card everywhere).

&gt;I'm budgeting something like 50 pounds / day for food (assume eating out mostly but I'm going to try my best to cook). Feasible? Way too much? Way too little?

WAY too much. If you are only eating out at medium/nice restaurants you'll spend probably £150 a week. That's eating lunch and dinner every day at a nice restaurant. I'd buget around £50-70 a week if you want to eat out fairly often and have nice food at your house. If you want to go as cheap as possible you can live off £20 a week if you know how to cook.

And although the Scots rebelled, the treatment afterwards was certainly brutal.  But in modern times, that isn't the case; and especially not since devolution.

&gt;A. Yes, of course. A lot of thought went into that decision. My initial feeling was that it wasn’t worth it and that I wouldn’t get a game. Then when I heard what the coach’s plans were I changed my mind. I didn’t go into it with my eyes closed. It was Jose Mourinho who convinced me. He said that I’d progress, that I’d reach the very highest level and that the move would be nothing but positive for me.

I think the No vote in the referendum for the North East assembly has caused a bit of concern for further devolution in the UK, but I don't believe that vote is representative of how people feel. It was rushed and campaigning was terrible on both sides, it was generally a poorly run referendum. 

The problem is there is a general disillusionment amongst most of the people who would want devolution. Dislike of Westminster's London bias leads to dislike of Westminster, which leads to dislike of politicians and eventually dislike of politics. Suddenly you get a whole bunch of people who appear to not care at all about politics, when in reality they're just disillusioned with the system. Something needs to happen that would whip these people up into pressing for devolution, but I don't see that happening for a while.

true,Mispla_cedUnderscore,eng-Bedfordshire,Bedfordshire,"Just a few tips from my experience:

1. Lectures - go to them! Yes this has been repeated many a time but remember its what you're there for after all. For me, the biggest help from lectures was finding the parts of a course I found difficult, and finding the lecturers I thought were crap (yes they exist, just like with teachers). This helps prioritising extra work/revision and is a godsend.

2. Clubs/Socities - join what ever takes your fancy. Football, Rugby, Ultimate Frisbee, Real Ale or even your political party of choice. You'll realise that you have more in common than your sport/society and these are the friends you get for life.

3. Socialise with your coursemates. Nothing felt more relieving (studywise) than when I was pulling an all-nighter, don't lie we have all done one, and your in the computer lab and theres people you know there too.
For us it helped create an atmosphere where everyone wanted everyone to succeed, instead of a 'me against you' nature that it felt like existed in 6th form.

4. Ask for help. If there's a lecture you didn't quite understand, ask someone about it, be it the lecturer or coursemates. Engaging with people about your course means that they will be more willing to help you when shit hits the fan. 
Likewise, return the favour when you can, the people who you help out when they're stuck will always happily help you out when they see that you're stuck.

5. LEARN. TO. COOK. If you've already got this sorted before you start then experiment with more risky dishes, or offer to make a meal for your flat mates. They will appreciate it a lot, and it saves you doing the dishes for a night and gets you some free pints.
If you've never done it before its a great way to learn. 24p pizzas from Asda aren't 'the shit' they are shit, you will feel as good as your meals are. My pro-tip, splurge on the 'out of date today' meat section every once in a while, the rump steak for £1.50 is more than a bargain when you feel like you're eating like royalty for that one meal a fortnight.

6. Make friends with your flat mates. These will be the first people you'll meet and they're gonna be around everyday for your first year and maybe beyond. Don't get along with these guys, at least to some extent, and you're gonna feel quite isolated in your flat and thats when homesickness will knick in.

7. Enjoy it all. Sometimes never said, but make sure you're having some fun. If your work feels overbearing, get a few mates to met up for a beer one night and just chill or do something over equal interest. It might not sound bad, but if you make studying the only part of your uni life, it will transition to work being the only part of your life.",0,1411089537,null,0,false,0,ckmcn0r,t3_2grc9c,t1_ckmcn0r,t3_2grc9c,null,1426934365,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Many Ashkenazic Jews, for example, share a distinct racial identity that's genetically independent of the German and Slavic populations in which they settled during the Middle Ages - indicating a small measure of interbreeding with Eastern Europe's native groups, and (before then) Spain's, and Northern Africa's, stretching back to Roman Palestine.

I'm sensitive about it due to mine - my father's papers, before he emigrated from the Soviet Union, listed his race as ""Jew"" despite his father's family having lived in what is now Ukraine for generations, and his mother's having lived in Poland.  Jews were generally kept separate throughout European history, further bolstering their racial Othering... let's not forget that the first ghettos were created for Jews in Italy in the *15th Century*.  There's a decades-old lie about the Jews being descended from the Khazars of central Asia, rather than from historical Jews, and thus stripped of their historical claim to Israel (present moral problems notwithstanding).

Jews spent a long time being told they were a separate race, despite the wish of most to assimilate and be ""normal"".  So to lose that distinct identity now can feel like an attempt to diminish past pain - although obviously that's not what you were doing here.  Like I said, sensitive.

(All that having been said, nothing is definite.  I am a Jew but I am also an American, and an American *first* - ""Jewish"" is a modifier of the dominant noun, for me, so I am a Jewish American, rather than an American Jew.  And an attorney.

This is why I think we need a much larger time-frame in which to vote.

Make voting mandatory (with an option on all ballots of ""None of the above"" if you don't want to choose), but give a 2 week window to cast your vote.

There are hundreds of reasons why people end up missing the opportunity to vote. Some people have holidays booked, some people get there too late, some people simply forget. And I know this could be helped by more people being aware of postal voting, but giving a two week window would be better and guarantee that more people voted.

We already have plenty of spaces throughout the country that we could use to do this. Council offices, job centres, Citizens Advice Bureau offices, even setting up a small stall in the local town centre would do. (If the fucking PPI/Ambulance chasers/Insurance sales people can do it, it can't be that hard.)

true,ukday,null,null,"I'm the poster boy for cruising through uni (got a 2.1 though and some solid firsts, including in my dissertation): My attendance in lectures / seminars was abysmal and I passed first year with an average of 45%. Yet even I think this is some of the worse advice going. 

Go into uni with the attitude that you're there to work from the start. If you turn first year into a joke with the attitude that you'll sort your act out in 2nd or 3rd (or 4th year) you're setting yourself up for a potential cluster fuck of a situation. First year is there to get you used to the standard of work the uni expects of you and is time for you to experiment with your essay / exam / study technique. You'll also more than likely find that first year work serves as a starting point for 2nd and 3rd year modules. The number of times I sat in lectures listening to the lecturer say 'And if you recall the work we went over in first year...' - no, I can't, I was more than likely asleep back in my hall from the night before. 

The biggest problem I saw people having who dossed through first year, and the one that we all least anticipated, is one of habit: by studying in first year you're developing the habit of studying and can immediately kick on at the start of 2nd year. The rest of us thought that we'd suddenly switch it on, only when we tried to do it we realised that our concentration spans and work habits were AWOL. 

All things considered most of the people who pissed their way through first year (and it was a lot of people) ended up fucking up their first half of second year due to underestimating the difficulty in going from getting 40s to 60s when writing essays (if you're doing maths etc then maybe you can get away with it a little more by just studying. But with the essays there's a technique / time element which takes some getting used to). By the time it was all sorted out they'd completed the first semester (20-40% of their degree) of the easiest of the 2 years which actually counted. If you're not careful you're then chasing a high 2.1/low first in 3rd year having got a 2.2 in second.

The Guardian is anti-western civilization and pro-terrorism. They accused Israel of violating a ceasefire when they responded to a rocket attack, saying that since Hamas never agreed to the ceasefire Israel agreed with Egypt, Hamas didn't violate it but Israel did. That's just 1 of literally thousands of examples of their bias, including [making up massacres of Palestinians](http://web.archive.org/web/20081005093332/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2002/may/06/mondaymediasection5). [They select stories very specifically to fit their agenda](http://cifwatch.com/2014/09/17/guardian-mangles-bill-clintons-recent-comments-about-israeli-palestinian-peace/) which causes their readers to be extremely misinformed.

[Google it and you find an abundance of evidence of their shoddy journalism](https://medium.com/@paul_a_smith/lies-damned-lies-statistics-and-the-guardian-7f4f88ade648).

To say that criticism of The Guardian is unwarranted is absurd. They are not a left wing paper despite what they claim, when their main agenda is to criticise the USA and Israel, 2 very left wing countries, and defend some of the most right wing countries in the world (such as Iran and the Vatican).

I’d say this is very strong evidence that people don’t vote because they feel it doesn't matter. It shouldn't be acceptable to blame low turnout on political apathy. 


However, I think the political establishment were very uncomfortable with the referendum being so close. While for most of us it’s been refreshing to have a debate on a choice that actually matters, I’d imagine they’ll be discussion whether it was a mistake to go to referendum on such an uncertain issue. Overall though, with the world watching, it has been a proud show of what UK democracy can be about.


It would be foolish to believe that all politics can be like this though. This has been a very important question but there is not an unlimited supply of big questions like this. Indeed you could effectively argue that to make politics a more powerful force in public life, technocratic politics should take a massive step back. People aren’t interested in political nitpicking, yet parties constantly strive to market it to the general man. Clearly, achieving a high turnout isn’t about that.

The only way to avoid this is to make sure the two positions are concurrently held by one person... which makes you wonder what the point of the whole thing is. Not to mention being a conflict of interest for the PM.

And that's just a practical concern. On a more principled level, an English parliament just invites greater disunity, separate national identities and inevitably future separation. The whole idea of a union is to be united.

Hopefully this vote can stand in as evidence that political engagement gives results, and if we're not happy with those who represent us, then we vote other people in or we stand ourselves, and get the votes.

The system is there to represent us.  If the people who the majority in the country do not like are in power, then it is up to us to change that instead of complain and not vote.  If the policies we do not like are being implemented it is up to us to change that.  The mechanism in in place to do it.  Nothing stops any of us from becoming an MP apart from age.  Most of us could gather the support, work for our community, and represent them (if you don't believe this, look at the UKIP leaflets I got through my door...).  If we believe the mechanism doesn't work for us, that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy as people disengage because of that belief.  The reverse is true.  The system works for us if we take part in it.

Dismissal of the current politicians as out of touch, serving London, or as 'toffs' is piss in the wind unless it is accompanied by alternatives that capture enough votes to change it.  We all do complaining really well, but complaining is not political engagement.  Only political engagement creates changes.  Today has shown the majority of people can engage politically.

The only way to avoid this is to make sure the two positions are concurrently held by one person... which makes you wonder what the point of the whole thing is. Not to mention being a conflict of interest for the PM.

And that's just a practical concern. On a more principled level, an English parliament just invites greater disunity, separate national identities and inevitably future separation. The whole idea of a union is to be united.

true,Taure,null,null,"The UK can be summarised by the idea of embracing modernity without rejecting our history.

An example of this can be seen in our approach to separation of powers.

While the separation of powers is considered an important constitutional principle in the UK, it is not considered the *only* such principle. Separation of powers has to be balanced against other principles. 

Foremost among these is the concept of the supremacy of Parliament: the idea that Parliament is the ultimate authority in the UK, capable of making and unmaking any law and unable to be overruled. This is justified on the principle of democracy, Parliament being the representatives of the people, but is also a historical artefact. It's the result of Parliament being the body responsible for defeating the monarchy in a civil war and thereafter exercising the powers of the monarch.

Given the supremacy of Parliament, separation of powers has a different interpretation. There's no point separating powers completely when one of the three is capable of overruling the other two via its ability to make laws on any matter. An executive and a judiciary completely divorced from Parliament would have no authority, because Parliament has the final say in all matters. So leadership of the executive is made up of members of the legislature, and the Supreme Court was established via Act of Parliament and lacks the power to strike down primary legislation.

It is expected that the head of the executive will be able to pass any legislation he or she wants. Indeed, any other circumstance is considered unacceptable - a vote of no confidence in the executive by the legislature - and generally triggers another election. 

It's important to remember that the historical source of ""constitutional danger"" is different in the UK. In the US, society sees itself as being divided into two groups: the government, and the people. The constitution developed to protect the people from the government.

But in the UK you have three groups: the Crown, the government, and the people. In the UK, the government developed to protect the people from the Crown. (Where ""the people"" historically meant landowners, much like it did in the US). This inevitably leads to a different approach to separation of powers. In the US, government is seen as the danger to civil liberties, and so checks are placed on it. In the UK, Parliament is seen as the guarantor of civil liberties, and so it is given sufficient power to perform this role.

Of course it's been a long time since the Crown did anything to try to gather power to itself, but cultural memory is a long thing. Even though the monarchy has long been neutered, we all learn about the English Civil War in school, when Parliament executed a monarch who tried to raise taxes. There's a definite sense, even in modern times, that Parliament is in some sense the defender of the people. For some, anti-terrorism legislation is changing this view, but for the general public it's not something on their radar.

It's the same reason why politicians are now committed to an EU referendum.

Our country is ran by chronic gambling addicts it would seem, politicians constantly taking bigger and bigger risks in the name of democracy.

It depends on where you're going, what the local options are, whether there's a sizeable expat community that will have specialist IFAs etc. You likely won't  have access to the same range of mutual funds etc that you would in the UK. And the tax position can be complex, to say the least. 

Your best bet is to ask some more senior colleagues who have been in the country for some time what they do with their money. Ask lots of people and make your decision. It's a good, if slightly nerdy, icebreaker as it shows you are thinking about your long term future in the country (even if you know you're only there temporarily).

For what it's worth, after a lot of searching, the best solution I could find for us was an account with the offshore branch of TD Invest. They let you invest in a wide range of things, including UK and US ETFs (inc. the popular Vanguard and iShares ones) and the fees are reasonable. I am a UK expat in the Cayman Islands where the absence of any tax can stack up good savings quite quickly, but the local banks offer virtually nothing in the way of savings products.

The problem with the money is everyone forgets about wages and sustainability. As I said on the show, we can afford the initial outlay for 90% of players, but there's no way we can afford the majority of wages - not only for those players, but also the existing players who will want the increase too. I do think an alternative model is there, and it involved new stadium and more fans. 

This is also why I don;t really mind the Amercianisation of our club - the global fan base is where the money comes from, and that in turn gives us the ability to attract big players. Man U finished 7th last year and got Falcao this year is a prime example of both of the above factors.

Totally agree with third paragraph, there's no one else who really has this.

Agree with teh fan point, and we do have a problem with fans who came in the Harry, VDV-Modric-Bale, Champions League years - that was the pinnacle of many years hard work and wasn't very Spursy.

* This referendum was forever (or at least a long time), but general elections happen every five years
* There were only two options declaring two distinct positions (albeit ones that on examination were a lot closer than would appear)
* The vote was for an idea rather than a politician
* The media can cover a national referendum to excess, whereas a lot of the local issues that affect general elections are of no interest to the London press

I wouldn't be surprised to see a slightly higher turnout for this general election than the last (65.1%, if you believe Wikipedia), but I can guarantee it will be lower than the 86% that is said to have voted yesterday.

How times change, it used to be almost unknown outside of Chepstow and climbing groups, now it has several references on t'internet including it's own Wikipedia page so you can just look at photos on there lol.

In my opinion, especially historically it's been a good thing for many people

Remember how Skrtel got dropped when BR first arrived. He was our most error prone player, and that saw him nearly get sold until an injury gave him his chance to get back. Lovren has the advantage of being the new guy, he won't be on the receiving end of stringent criticism until he has a proper chance to settle, Sakho's been here a whole season, he doesn't get to just walk away from it.

That said I don't think Sakho's dropping has anything to do with this mistake, as I said [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2gn0dv/skrte_or_sakho_against_west_ham/ckkozyk) I think what it comes down to is bringing back a set-piece weapon, the team is still in a wicked state of flux, new back-line, new people in the front -  bringing Skrtel back won't make us magically better but having him back will make us a bit more dangerous from set-pieces.

If Labour can get behind the idea, I'd welcome it. I might even vote for them I'd they stood on the platform of creating a Northern assembly. But the Tories? They'll never agree to something like that. 

That ass Fabricant was making noises about reducing the ""English Parliament"" idea to the simple subset of English MPs sitting independently a few days a week a while back. I can't imagine a more unfortunate outcome to this mess.

true,Quazz,capaldi,Capaldi,"&gt;Next is the bedroom scene, another incredible scene. I won't touch on the debate about whether someone entered the room because obviously the doctor got in without them noticing. I watched the reveal of the ""guest"" about a dozen times and I have no doubt in my mind that that thing was not human. I know it's blurry, but I will not accept it as human, child or otherwise. I have kids and have experience with kids, but I don't know a single one that would have remained completely silent and relatively motionless that long while all that was happening. Lastly, the exit. I watched this a dozen times as well. There's a distinct flash of blue light with a pretty obvious lens flare as the door opens. Definitely not the hallway light. More interesting to me is the fact that there's never a shadow in front of the light, like you would expect from someone walking through the door. Another thing worth noting is that the door barely opens, and it closes very quickly.

It was a child. Sorry, but it was. I don't care if it didn't look like one. That's irrelevant. If it looked like a child then the episode would have no further point to carry on because we'd all know there is no monster. Ergo they make it look like *not* a child. I don't care if you have kids and experience with them, every kid is different and if you're living in an orphanage even more so. Some are going to act in ways you wouldn't expect. 

We lose track for a moment before the exit, plenty of time to walk through the door, squeeze through and leave. We don't know what the blue light is, but blue lights aren't exactly rare. It's only seen when the door opens a bit, so obviously it's something down the hallway. 

&gt;Next up is the scene in the future. Actually, before that, why the hell did Orson wear the space suit into the restaurant to get Clara? Minor point, but it's been bugging me. Anyway, back to the space ship. This one seems the most plausible, but still some questions. I can buy the pressure stabilizing explanation, but why was it focused on the door? I would assume that would affect the whole ship equally, but the doctors and Clara's reaction clearly show it coming from the door. And the knocking seemed very deliberate. But like I said, this one is plausible for me. I don't like it, but I can live with it.

He wore it to attract her attention and probably because the Doctor told him to. 

Doors (and windows) are weakpoints. They tend to be affected more than other parts when the pressure ramps up. It only sounds like knocking because that's what they expect to hear. That's kind of the point. You hear things differently because you're scared. The whole episode is about perception and how it changes when you're scared. 

&gt;Not much to say about the scene with young doctor. Some people were saying it might be the Master or another time Lord, but several people said the Doctor Who Extra, or whatever it's called, explained pretty explicitly that it's the doctor. Another minor point; why the hell did Clara grab his ankle? It seemed like a quick impulse, but that reaction makes no sense to me...it definitely doesn't feel like it would be a natural reaction. My main problem with this is how does that prove anything? Clara grabs his ankle, then has this huge, episode-ending epiphany that there was no creature. I don't understand how that proves anything. I'm ok with the ""it's all in his head"" ending, but I'm not ok with how she arrived at that conclusion.

It's 100% the Doctor. 

When Clara realised that no monster had grabbed the Doctor, but she did, then obviously what they were chasing didn't exist. It was just fear running wild. The whole reason they started hunting the creature is because the Doctor was scared. He was scared because Clara grabbed him as a child. And now he finally wanted to face it.

The Yes campaign was very successful and appears to be garnering praise all around, the Better Together campaign was horrible and negative they won providing last minute promises that the Yes campaign had initially asked to be on the ballot. The referendum provided a great basis for discussion and revitalised politics, the turn out was amazing. 

At the end of the day the Yes campaign provided a great platform for pointing out problems with Westminster and will contribute to the betterment of Scotland through the delivery of more powers despite not gaining independence.

The North of England voted 78% AGAINST versus 22% in favour of, having a regional assembly when offered the chance, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_England_devolution_referendums,_2004

And they were thought to be the English region most in favour of English regional assemblies.   I could be wrong, but I doubt much has changed.

So it looks unlikely, and against the will of the people.  The English don't seem to want to be divided into sub-regions each with their own assembly.

But the fundamental issue is this:
- It isn't acceptable to Scotland to have English MPs voting on matters that are internal to Scotland
- But, given the above, it isn't acceptable to England to have Scottish MPs voting on matters that are internal to England.


The solution seems to be: the federal ""regions"" of the UK, are England, Scotland, Wales, and NI.    Each of these ""regions"" would have its own devolved parliament or assembly, responsible for devolved matters.    And the UK parliament would be responsible for UK wide matters.

One result would be a weaker UK central government.  But if we work it right, we can make that a good thing.   For one thing it will stop stupid national politicians introducing crazy policies just because their party got 37% of the UK-wide vote on a whole grab-bag of unrelated issues at the last general election.

&gt;I see EV4EM (as I'm going to start calling it) as an anti-devolution, anti-federalism position- it effectively cements power over English matters in the UK parliament. 

I think at this stage its really hard to define it as a concrete idealogy. It's simply that a lot of peoples position for the West Lothian question has been 'well thats not fair, they get to vote on their own issues but on ours also'. Which as a Scot living in wales, with sigificant time in England. Seems to fundamentally be a fair position that its hard to argue against.

It's also very unlikely, indeed it arguably is allready - that its not going to be trust towards the front of the debate, espeically if more powers are going to the devolved parliments. 

&gt;EV4EM has never had wide support outside of the Tory party as a solution to the West Lothian question.

I think this is debatable. I think its actually quite popular with the lay community, its just never really been seen as a particular hot issue, more a low level grumble.

Time will tell however. I would content here also that, I think it is something that has not been insigificant to the rise of UKIP.

Tesco obviously has stores in both Scotland and England, those stores don't separately pay tax though, Tesco the company just makes one big collective payment. To know what tax was generated where you'd have to force Tesco to introduce some hideously complex accounting to track it all. 

Aside from introducing the problem that companies could move money around, depriving areas of tax that was generated there you *also* don't re-distribute wealth. If Scottish Tesco stores generated more tax per head then others then the Scottish government would receive more tax per head to spend than other places.

That's one definition of fair (Everyone gets their own) but not another (Everyone gets what they need)

So the barnett formula is crude but effective and avoids all of the above. Central tax, central budget then off that budget you calculate devolved funds using population share.

But even then true democracy is a bad idea, by definition the exceptional are in a minority, if you truly govern by majority 50% of the population are below average, and on major complex issues involving the need for a good understanding and working knowledge of issues, the ill-informed have more voting power.

The reason I was in favour, was like most other people in favour, it seemed completely unfair that a party's seats wasn't closely linked to how many votes they got.   You know, libdems get 25% of votes, and 10% of seats, etc.

Now I realize seats in parliament is the wrong unit of counting anyway.   Who cares whether there are say 50 or 100 libdem MPs with their nose in the feeding trough (the same applies to Labour, or Tories).   

That's a micro-detail, and the fact is that it doesn't really matter whether a vote in parliament is passed (or defeated) 350 vs 250 votes or 400 vs 200 votes, or 500 vs 100 votes.

What actually matters is whether the outcome of those votes in parliament reflects the broad will of the country, as reflected in the last general election.

With FPTP, most of the time it has.  Whichever party got more votes, (yes not more than 50%, but more than anybody else) nearly always has ended up forming the government.

The exceptional election was the last one that led to the coalition.  That's when FPTP went disfunctional.  Because yes, the most popular of the 3 main parties ended up in government (just),  but the policies the government adopted are things that neither conservatives nor libdems voted for.  They were wierd compromises as well as tons of stuff made up on the spot, which both parties could live with - but which neither party had a mandate for.

The exact same wierdness would be guaranteed every time with most forms of PR.

true,dontthrowstones,null,null,"&gt;It's pretty clear that you are being smug over something that you had absolutely nothing to do with. The Scottish sub had/has a majority of pro-independence people. These Yes voters were hopeful that they would win the referendum (duh). You seem to be implying that these people were presenting themselves as being in the actual real world majority but really that is just you're impression. What lessons are to be learned exactly? People shouldn't express their opinions unless they know that they are in the majority? This all boils down to your own paranoia and political insecurity. It seems as though you were/are intimidated by being a minority in an online platform.

Do you charge for amateur psychology sessions or is that just something you try to practice in your spare time?

&gt;The Yes campaign was very successful and appears to be garnering praise all around, the Better Together campaign was horrible and negative 

The losing campaign was very successful, the winning one horrible and negative? I can't hear you from all the horns drowning out the sound of freedom... and I'll excuse you from any braindump of your nervous system.

&gt;they won providing last minute promises that the Yes campaign had initially asked to be on the ballot.

I think there's a realisation throughout the UK we need a joined up approach to how we are governed. That will now come about, something positive to come from a divisive issue, so on that we can agree. 

But that doesn't address my original point, that what is described as new media (note again, not any one page on reddit, although the frontpage of /r/scotland these past few weeks is the poster child for the symptoms described) allows a warped perspective to develop, perhaps more so than traditional media 'alignment'. Its inherently unfocussed, unprofessional hivemind nature can mislead people into creating a false consensus. 

Hundreds of yessers marched to the Beeb over their partiality. What's the best course of action when new media diverges so greatly from reality?

Post-grad study is not the same as undergraduate study - masters students in particular are a great source of revenue for universities, with a lot lower overhead (especially for a research-based masters), so as long as you can cover the fees they are a lot less strict about allowing you in.

As others have said the best thing to do is speak to the departments you're interested in - a narrow 2:1 miss shouldn't make any difference in getting you onto a masters course.  If you have the fees and show you're keen they'll bite your hand off in most places.

I think (and could be wrong as I am relying on memory) that there just isn't as big a support in the North for this kind of devolution as there is in Scotland and Wales, both of which have much stronger national identities. A much larger proportion of people in those areas feel more English and British than anything and just didn't see the point. 

I personally think that there is a great case for more regional powers but setting up 3 or 5 or 10 or however many regional assemblies they need to be should only be done if people really want it, if it will make a genuine difference and if there are clearly defined roles for them and this requires reform at Westminster as well and God knows that's going to be a bloody nightmare.

Individuals are entitled to ask for things from government.  So are groups of people.  So are charities.  So are pressure groups. And so are businesses.  That's lobbying, and perfectly legitimate - indeed desirable in a democracy.

Bribery is when they give money or other stuff, to get MPs to do what they want, ask questions, vote in a certain way, etc.  That's corruption and bribery. And it needs to be stomped on.  Much harder than it has been.  And the penalties need to be severe (prison times from both the briber and bribee).

One problem is the line is sometimes hazy.  You're not allowed to take money or gifts as a bribe, but what about if a lobbyer takes an MP to lunch?  Or on a research trip to a factory?  What if the research trip is in Bermuda?

I think we need very clear definitions and rules.  A minor accidental transgression might still attract a slap on the wrist, but major transgressions need to be stamped on.

And while we're at it, similar sorts of rules need to be enforced with civil servants, local government officials, and the police.

The Yes campaign was successful, it wanted devo max as an option and provided Westminster keeps its word this time Scotland will get it. Seems to me that the Yes campaign has gained Scotland more power and lost it...nothing. Whereas the No campaign has gained what exactly? The independence referendum presented Scotland with a win win. The Yes campaign obviously didn't achieve its full objective but it was still beneficial to Scotland and perhaps the rest of the UK as well.
The No campaign was terrible nothing but fear mongering and apparent desperation. The Yes campaign has been commended as an example to the rest of the world. I think it's great that Scotland was able to create such a discussion and I hope it can pull together after quite a close race.

Policies and investment benefits London at the expense of other areas, most new graduates entering the Job market are more than likely going to be looking towards having to live in or commute to London because that's where all the jobs are. Infrastructure and transport in other areas doesn't get funded or built because most of the businesses are encouraged to set up shop in the capital and then because of this we apparently need yet another airport there. So it's just a vicious cycle of a city getting more and more money and investment and attention when it really really doesn't need it at this point and all this comes at the expense of the rest of the country.

But because it is the political capital and the place where all of our 'leaders' are this will keep happening. They obviously have an interest in continuing to keep London dominant and are going to be up close and personal with all of the major businesses in the country there.

I dunno I'm kind of all over the place complaining but I just want a mass devolution of powers across the entire country; not just Scotland. I want a proper English Parliament that isn't in London (have a national one in London, sure).

It also is not the most economically powerful city, or arguably the only major cultural one either. It's not a giant transport hub for the rest of the country and all of the major businesses in the US are not centered there.

Look at Israel.

The two main parties are always close, and need to get votes from minor (often single issue) parties with 1% or 2% of the vote, in order to get a majority.

As a condition of support, that minor party, usually requires that they get what they want on their particular bugbear.

So you end-up implementing strange laws that, at best, only 1% of the population cares about, or at worst that are insane laws that the 1% of lunatics in the country fanatically support.

That's not democracy, that's a tyranny of minorities.

The usual PR supporter answer to this is:   We'll put threshold, say a minimum of 5% of the vote.

IMHO that's worse.  

Now you've conceded seats should not precisely match votes (why does PR only apply to parties with 5% to 35% of the vote? Shows how hypocritical on ""fairness"" that many of the PR supporters really are)

Either way the status quo is no longer tenable. 

I also think that yes, these polls exist but are fundamentally strange. What has lead to much of these concerns is not simply scotish MP's or welsh or N.I's voting on English matters but devolved powers being beyond the reach of English MP's.

But also the fact that within england itself, *there is* a huge bias towards London.

I think a new dialog is allready rolling on this, and I think an important thread in it needs to be, that what is right for Yorkshire might not be what is right for london, and that the 'well more politicans cost money and are shit who wants that' the prevaling view, needs more scrutiny.

Ok, so maybe we need to look at how we can speed up the political process to cater for economic change. The problem with allowing corporations to set the agenda is you end up with stuff like this TTIP agreement, undoubtedly great for business, but terrible for democracy. How do you balance the two?

&gt;This is just silly, multinational corporations do for the most part pay tax

Yeah, I was being a little facetious with that point, but I do believe that most multinationals have a vested interest in being the UK market, and they don't need governments to bend the rules for it to be profitable venture for them to do so.

&gt;This shows you have a lack of understanding when talking about business, competition is what makes corporations flourish and strive to become more efficient and generally improve themselves.

No, I agree, but I think lobbying leads to the opposite of that.

You realise nobody up here uses that term, right? Seriously, we don't have a nickname for you lot.

&gt;You had them so rattled that they panicked and promised you the earth.

You know what they say about politicians and promises. Flashback to 1979 where just before the referendum for a Scottish assembly, Thatcher promised that if Scotland voted no, they'd still get an assembly.

We didn't get that assembly. Camer-cleg-band won't give us what theh promised for two reasons:

1. They don't want a Scotland that can do more things on it's own.
2. The vast majority of MPs in westminster have vowed to oppose any new powers to Scotland.

They shaved it close, but they won't change. They may have been scared but they got what they want and considering we won't get another referendum for at least another 40 years (by that time I think they would have fucked Scotland over so much it couldn't survive as a county let alone a country), they'll continue doing what they want.

And what's more, there's another threat on the horizon. UKIP. UKIP paints itself as an anti EU party but it's other major policy is the total abolition of Devolution in the home nations. Best case scenario set to gain a seat or two, at worse case scenario, set to go into opposition against the Tories. If that happens the home nations are screwed, because if there's one thing UKIP and a good chunk of the Tories agree on is ""the home nations should lose their powers and all power should be in London"".

Funny thing is TTIP hasnt even been shown to lobbyists or corporations for exactly the reason you are scared of. Sure its secretive but its EU and US lawyers that are working on it, not lobbyists and politicians.

&gt; Yeah, I was being a little facetious with that point, but I do believe that most multinationals have a vested interest in being the UK market,

Oh definitely, as long as a business is making money its worth being in that market, especially a first world country like the UK.

&gt; and they don't need governments to bend the rules for it to be profitable venture for them to do so.

On the other hand if the lobbyists suggest policies that are detrimental to the population how far do you go? Im not claiming to have the answers im just saying lobbyists are necessary for business, but to what extent is debatable.

true,HugoRune1965,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"I don't think this is a fair assessment of the situation. You have to remember that the referendum has brought forward a lot of issues that were swept under the carpet before.

MP's that represent English constituencies are quite rightly concerned that any deal should be fair to English regions as well. I think that a more positive interpretation might be that there is a call for less centralisation in government.

One thing that has been mentioned is the so called ""West Lothian Question"".  Basically this is the issue that Scottish MP's still vote on issues that do not affect Scotland because they are devolved matters(e.g. Health and Education).

The claim that Scotland is ""sending more money than it gets back"" is only true if you assume that revenue from oil initially belongs to Scotland. If you treat oil revenue as a UK resource then Scotland does quite well, getting more per head of population spent on it than England.

Also the Scottish government already has the power to raise more money by varying income tax (or possibly cut income tax if it decides to spend less) and  the Scotland Act 2012 granted further tax varying powers that will come into force in 2016. All three parties have pledged even more powers on top of those.

I would not get too disheartened, the referendum has given quite a shake-up to politics in the UK. The fact that the turnout was so high indicates that people are not really apathetic about politics, and the fact that the three major UK political parties came together in agreement over this is unprecedented.

This could be the shake up that our London-centric government needed.

Here are some classics /u/NEWSBOT3 came out with last night, and the reason he's on my shit list.

On discussing the length of my hair (it's now reaching my shoulders).

Nouser: yeah, it's looking a bit shit at the moment, I need to get it cut a bit shorter, there's not much style in it now (I'd just put it up in a ponytail).

BOT: yep. 

On the subject of us all being besties on Facebook and getting /u/away_in_chow_meinger in on the action.

Nouser to chow: I must warn you, there are some pretty hideous photos of me on there, especially when I was a bit fatter.

BOT: yep.

BOT: would you prefer I lied to you?

Nouser: yes I fucking would!

DO YOU EVEN KNOW HOW TO BLOKE???

Anyway, much fun was had by all, and kudos to /u/away_in_chow_meinger for making the effort to come down from Oxford, unlike some of you useless bastards in London eh?

The gentlemen (BOT excused, I can't call him a 'gentleman') rather liked the Roebuck. There are x2 student halls opposite, and there are many ladies (well, girls really) not wearing very much at all either drinking in the pub or walking past. Unexpected muff fest ftw? Also, they do film nights on Mondays (October is Philip Seymour Hoffman night) and quizzes on Tuesdays, so it might be our new venue in place of the Trinity, which frankly now looks a bit shit and far too vanilla after its refurb. However, if we do switch venues it'll be sacrificial for me, because the tall barman is SIX FOOT BLEEDIN' NINE, and I think he's got a bit of an older lady crush on me too, bless him. 

The toilets in the Roebuck are pretty minging. There's barely any light there and the doors are stupid. However, the Trinity have completely changed theirs during their refurb, and you can now [watch yourself wee](http://i.imgur.com/ReN5tVQ.jpg?1). In case you're curious, no, I did not. 

As he's not visible in the other photos, here's /u/_samson's [pretty face](http://i.imgur.com/ONAYvLf.jpg) on the right, whilst /u/really_likes_nutella eyes the cameraman suspiciously. 

I did not eat a bone btw, it was bone marrow. Nutella tried some and was not impressed. Oh, note to the pub, I know you're meant to eat it with a bit of salt, but please don't pre-salt it for me, you over-salted it and it was nasty. 

True to form, nutella was the one who, despite saying he can't stay late (he can never stay late) nagged us all to have scotch/brandy at 11.30pm or so.

I stroked /u/_samson's beard and rate it 7/10 on softness scale. He claims he doesn't even condition it! However, I was sorely disappointed to discover that /u/withabeard had left the £7 bottle of conditioner I bought him at the last meet in Bristol and therefore his beard still felt like an old person's pubes. I think we agreed (I was a bit squiffy at this point) that we're going to trim that beard off, no? But he wouldn't let me last night, even though I had scissors on me (to stab /u/NEWSBOT3 if he didn't shut up, obvs). 

Oh I nearly forgot, Samson (because he's a prick) thought it appropriate to carry on the Red Lion tradition of eating the flowers, but the ones on our table were some sort of peppers (?). Nutella and Chow, being youngsters who clearly can't stand peer pressure also indulged, and the silly twats all ended up with very sore tongues. I took this one for /u/invader-strange, because I know he loves this shit. [Plant in a mug](http://i.imgur.com/SoN8VAL.jpg).

I'm staying with my uncle at the moment and when I got home (at about 1am), my cousin was up and was quite pissed. Apparently he'd had a fight with his girlfriend who he's about to move into because he'd smacked some fella who made the mistake of looking at her (actually, he claimed he was trying to chat her up in front of him). Said he'd been waiting up for me, poured 2/3rds of a bottle of wine down my neck, and then proceeded to snort a line of coke off the garden table *and then tried to snog me*. That's the second time one of my cousins has tried to snog me; I need to have a word with my mum about what the fuck is wrong with our family. He's currently upstairs in bed throwing a sickie and dying - I wonder if he'll remember. Should I tell him? He's not a kid, dude is 28 years old. 

Being the responsible niece that I am, I left things neat and tidy, including my [shoes](http://i.imgur.com/ATjyEmh.jpg). 

We stayed up until 3am and I was feeling rather fragile a few hours ago, but a few cups of coffee have sorted me out, and I'm going to make us bacon butties shortly. Bacon makes EVERYTHING better. But be warned, if you come along to one of these meets, be under no illusion that you'll get away early, nor have a cheap night out (I spent a fuck ton, somewhere between £100 and £150, I don't really want to add it up), but if you sit yourself next to Samson, he'll buy and share ALL the £26 bottles of wine with you, so just do that. Bloody rich banker fat cat. 

It was a very fun night and /u/_samson and I are going to organise a Christmas meet, and we expect more of you to turn up to this one.

Finally, I have had a change of heart regarding dogs v cats. The little shits have given me a face, leg and elbow bath this morning and lifted my spirits when I was cripplingly hungover. However, I wouldn't recommend letting a Jack Russell sit on your tits, they're very muscly and heavy (the dogs, not my tits). 

Pics for Jester. [Cooper](http://i.imgur.com/97kgXYS.jpg?1). I have taught him to bring and drop the ball to me, much to his parents' surprise. Cooper likes to copy everything Daisy does, so now he's a licker too. [Daisy](http://i.imgur.com/MaPFR4l.jpg?1) is the main licker; she spent half an hour licking the moisturiser off my arms the other night. She also terrorises the postman and has an intense dislike of animated meerkats.

Both campaigns should be happy with the result, though yes will obviously be feeling deflated this morning. 87% turnout is quite an achievement and the debate was carried out amicably for the most part. I think it's been good for Scotland to have this conversation with itself and it's been good that a clear majority has given a definitive answer to the question, for a generation at least. 

There's a lot to do in the aftermath though. Scotland clearly has some appetite for change, precisely how much change needs to be hammered out over the coming months. It's becoming increasingly clear that people in England would like regional powers as well.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"**41,863,828, assuming there are only two parties standing.**

I suppose you're going to want me to justify that! OK, here's what I did.

Parliament has 650 seats, so to win an absolute majority you need to win 326 of them (650/2 + 1).

To win each seat, if there are only two candidates, you need to get in each constituency (50% + 1 vote) of all the votes cast.

So what we need to do is to find the 326 constituencies with the smallest number of voters, and work out what (50% + 1 vote) is for each of them. That's what you require to win, so the remainder of the votes is what you can get and still lose.

Go to http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/sape/parliament-constituency-pop-est/mid-2012/index.html to get the most up-to-date estimates for constituency populations.

Download the Excel spreadsheet, navigate to tab 3 (""Mid-2012 Persons"") and sort it by column C. You now have a list of constituencies going from the one with the smallest number of voters (Aberconwy, 56,457) to the greatest (West Ham, 160,408).

Now it's a simple matter to apply the concepts above, giving a win (to the Tories, if you like) with just 14,703,968 votes cast. The remaining almost-42-million votes went to the not-Tories party.

It gets more complicated with more parties standing, because instead of requiring (50% + 1 vote) to take each constituency you need (*T*/*n* + 1) where *T* is the total number of votes and *n* is the number of parties standing.

Who has maybe career long contacts and previous history with relevant parties. Where as other groups may have to rely on donations and volunteers.  They might have to fit lobbying around their own career or family. They may not as familiar with process and likely dont have existing contacts. 

The community's argument might be as good or better,  but without the resorces they may stuggle to get heard.

Thats before you start fuzzing the lines. Of what is and isnt dodgy. Maybe the corp can convalute the issue with other issues. And horse trade the issues. If you let us win this one ill back down onthis other issue thats more awkward for you.

A dictatorship is also able to act decisively, but it is not democratic. 

Saying ""why not be a dictatorship?"" shifts the discussion from ""which is the best democratic system of election?"" to something entirely different. Namely, the legitimate use of political power. Because we believe only democracy legitimises power, dictatorship isn't even on the table.

And to use it as a way to wake up the people is a very irresponsible idea. It takes a lot to rile the public these days, but to think that what you are suggesting is the way to do is short sighted and foolish.

Remember when any form of government can happily and easily ignore a million strong peaceful anti-war march and just do what they were going to do anyway, it shows just how little they think of anyone opinions. What kind of example does that show the rest of the nation? The work has to be done to engage with people and remind them that MP's and councillors are civil servants and not rulers, inturn those in such positions need reminding of their roles. 

Long term your idea isn't a bad one, but it's a hell of a lot of work before it's a sensible option. currently it would just cause more harm than good.

&gt;A __joke__ is something spoken, written, or done with [humorous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour) intention.  Jokes may have many different forms, e.g., a single word or a gesture (considered in a particular context), a question-answer, or a whole [short story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story). The word ""joke"" has [a number of synonyms](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wikisaurus:joke), including *wisecrack*, [gag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag), [prank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prank), [quip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quip), [jape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jape) and *jest*.  To achieve their end, jokes may employ [irony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony), [sarcasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm), [word play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_play) and other devices. Jokes may have a [punch line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_line), i.e., an ending to make it humorous.

&gt;A [practical joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_joke) or [prank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prank) differs from a spoken joke in that the major component of the humour is physical rather than verbal (for example placing salt in the sugar bowl).

Brand is certainly exaggerating his point, but it's not a complete misrepresentation.

Brand, for all his faults, and he has many (as I'm sure even he, in his less egotistical moments would admit), isn't pro Islamic fundamentalism or war, he's just saying he can see the attraction of someone who's been in a position of powerlessness for some time getting to offer up threats directly to the most powerful man in the world (allegedly).  Where Brand is wrong on this, I'd argue, is that many of the putative jihadies are thoroughly middle class.

When all the prices are marked the same thing, it's easier for people to forget that they are technically paying some minimal percentage more at the end of the bill.

The other thing to note is that it would effect advertising in all media.  You'd have to produce a different advertisement in every state, every city quoting a different price.

Pointing to examples of failure (or success), is called evidence.  It's anecdotal evidence.  But it is a form of evidence.  It's pretty much the opposite of ad hominem.

Perhaps each MP should be evaluated more frequently.  a yearly ""vote of confidence"" based on whether the area they represent feels they have actualy represented them.

If your MP goes against the wishes of the majority too often and votes to pass laws and such that the population of their constutuancy do not feel they were elected to represent, then they risk losing their seat (along with a penalty of ... let's say, being unable to run for ANY political office for 10  years) and replaced with a new candidate chosen by the public from a cross representation of all the parties in the area.

And the income tax thing in the UK I don't get. Why can't there be a UK-wide income tax and then the individual jurisdictions implement their own on top? Why does it have to be the UK turning over part of its income tax to Scotland, Wales, etc?

In the US, schools and other things are run by the states. States are free to raise money however they want. The federal government coerces states to do what the feds want by giving states money if they follow federal rules. There's still flexibility in there for states to reject the money or to do it different from other states within the federal guidelines. There just needs to be a clear line about who is in charge of what, and who can tell who what to do. I guess going from a unitary government to a federal system is kind of hard, especially one as old as the UK's, but it could work.

There was scarcely any campaining that I remember from either side. Certainly not much in the way of actual arguments, just ""vote yes, it'll be better"" ""vote no, it won't"" which is about all you can say when its mostly a reorganisation of county council powers.

Maybe it was a mistake, and its since been shown that if theres appetite more powers can be devolved later. But at the time Wales was undevolved, Londons system of mayor and assembly wasn't present and the only example we had was scotland which had devolved with way more power than we were offered and hadnt claimed any more since devolution at that point.

This map shows the deviation of each region's votes from the mean average result in the Scottish Independence Referendum 2014.

Red indicates a stronger deviation towards a NO vote, whereas green indicates a deviation towards YES. Colours have been normalised independently against the positive and negative deviations, such that the highest deviations are solid red and green respectively. This effectively shows how differently each region voted in comparison to the final result.

Brand's not condemning one and endorsing the other. He is quite clearly condemning the powerful for using the poor and disenfranchised to act as the pawns in. I think these little toerags who have buggered off to support ISIS are sick, yet it isn't particularly difficult for me to imagine that they probably did feel quite dispossessed back in England. The same way I think frankly little of the soldiers who went over to Iraq to fight in oil wars while also understanding that a great many of them come from a poorer background and probably didn't have much better going on back here. The military, especially in the US, has a history of recruiting these people for this exact reason.

true,LimitlessLTD,eng-Surrey,Surreeh,"&gt; I don't hate the NHS. I just think it needs to improved. Looking at the service through rose-tinted spectacles, refusing to admit faults, or brushing problems under the carpet doesn't make them go away.

Please tell me where i have done that... i admitted the NHS has problems, why the fuck do you think im looking at it ""with rose tinted glasses"". Im looking at it objectively, comparing it to other national health services, im not parroting what the Murdoch media empire says about it like you so clearly are.

&gt; Like I said, the majority view about the police was similar not that long ago. Any anecdotal examples were explained away as a few bad apples in the best service in the world. Of course that was before Stephen Lawrence, or killing an innocent Brazilian electrician, or they were filmed beating (to death) an innocent newspaper seller in the street for no particular reason.

More hyperbolic fucking nonsense, you give me 3 more anecdotes (one of which i have no idea what you are talking about, maybe it was ian Tomlinson who was hit in the leg and pushed to the ground during the London riots, but he certainly wasnt beaten to death). The ""innocent brazilian electrician"" was killed almost 10 years ago and the public investigation into that found:

&gt; This alleged that the police service had failed in its duty of care to Menezes. The service was found guilty and fined. On 12 December 2008 an inquest returned an open verdict.

and stephen lawrence was 21 fucking years ago.

&gt; After the initial investigation, five suspects were arrested but not convicted.[4] It was suggested during the course of that investigation that the murder was racially motivated and that Lawrence was killed because he was black, and that the handling of the case by the police and Crown Prosecution Service was affected by issues of race. A public inquiry was held in 1998,[5] headed by Sir William Macpherson, that examined the original Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) investigation and concluded that the force was ""institutionally racist"". It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be abrogated in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence; this became law in 2005 with the passage of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. 

How biased are you? Can i ask, are you Rupert Murdoch himself? Because i have not heard this level of hate projected towards British emergency services since reading The Sun. You need to stop reading those pieces of garbage. Investigations have been held into two of those events you talked about, and the police where held accountable each time.

These are just more anecdotes and *generally* the police service and NHS are both very good institutions. **Of course there are problems just like there are problems with any system, and the way to deal with these problems is to conduct thorough investigations into the incidents.** Which happened on both Stephen Lawrence and the brazilian electrician. (Ian tomlinsons investigation was not conducted because of the pathologists disgreeing with his cause of death).

Stop with your fucking scare mongering and moronic assertions. I wont reply to you again, im done with your Murdoch repetition.

true,practically_floored,newcr-1,,"Wolfsburg are a good side. They won the Bundesliga a few years ago and took Bayern Munich close just a few weeks ago. They also finished just 1 point off the Champion's League last season. We put 3 goals past them and put the game to bed, then started playing at 80% and rested on our 3 goal lead, trying to play for counter attacks. It would be nice to play 100% all the time but we have another game in a few days so it was the right choice, and we even got a 4th goal after that so it worked anyway. It was a great performance.

As for our form, we always start the league slow. Last year we didn't get a win until the 4th game either, the difference being two of the teams we failed to beat ended up getting relegated whereas this season IMO Chelsea will walk the league and we dominated Arsenal but unfortunately were not match fit enough to see out the game and it ended in a draw. The team are getting into their stride now, the first few games are not an indication of our form for the rest of the season.

As far as what the result *actually* means, we're now [top of our group](http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2015/standings/round=2000587/group=2003504/index.html) and IMO probably only need another win and a draw to make it to the next round. Wolfsburg are one of the better teams in the competition so it's a great start. 

As for what your friends said, even without the penalty we still would have won 3-1, which would still have been the best result by any English team in European competition this week.

* Government transparency act which requires all government data tables to be published online at a centralized location in a tabulated format (ie, show us the damn spreadsheets).  
* Reform the BoE; this is complicated but the long and short of it is new currency would no longer be issued to banks; it would be loaned out to infrastructure projects that had supporting economic studies showing they were viable.

Complete Lords reform. Much much smaller and a gradual increase in the number of elected peers. Would really like to cut out party politics from here as much as possible. Perhaps long terms with a restriction on peers moving to the Commons.

true,Jaxon1198,sontaran,Sontaran,"So a few things to keep in mind.  This was a Christmas Special not a season premiere.  I think because of that things were a bit more over-the-top in some ways.  Christmas specials are kind of a thing in England, and this was probably intended to be more of a cinematic event rather than just another episode.   

Also, Donna is a very polarizing character.  In Runaway Bride she is honestly a little annoying but I think we just needed something different after the devasting loss at the end of Season 2.  I personally love Donna, she is my favorite companion.  The comic chemistry between Tennet and Tate is fantastic and we haven't seen a companion like her since.  Why do I like Donna so much?  Well she isn't easily impressed by the Doctor.  It's not the situation where he is sweeping some googly-eyed girl off to Wonderland.  I actually found the whole....""I'm a starry eyed girl with no direction and the doctor is SOOOO dreamy"" trope to be far more annoying than Donna's crassness.  He actually has to work to impress her and in that way I feel like their relationship is one of the most unique and realistic on the entire show.  Also she calls out the ridiculousness of the Doctor which works as a great surrogate for the viewer.  Basically [Donna's future](#s ""Her not being a Doctor groupie allows them to become best buddies, which is exactly what the Doctor needs after the loss of Rose and all the more devastating that he cannot manage to keep her safe.  She says it herself, ""I would have traveled with you forever."" and it's my belief that the Doctor would have let her. For me the loss of Donna beats out the loss of Rose any day.  I still have a hard time getting through her departure scene."" )

Also Season 1 Who and Season 7 Who, for example, are very different shows in some respects.  Not bad different, IMO, just different and I think you start to see the show changing a little after season 2.  

My advice stick with it.  There are SOOO many episodes of Doctor Who that you are bound to come across a few that are just meh.

So he's not proud of the other 2 million **Scottish** men and women who went out to vote against independence then? I thought he was an advocate for all Scottish people - not just a single ideology.

They made the choice that the majority wanted, but they've rattled some cages in Westminster all the while. Plus it's got the whole UK talking about how devolved powers might be more suitable for other areas too.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"Chip &amp; Pin as implemented in the UK pretty much uses public-private cryptography, a similar concept to SSL/TLS (e.g. https) on the internet.

Basically the chip is a very small computer that stores the user's Pin (amongst other things) in an encrypted form. When you use an ATM or a POS terminal you key in your Pin to identify yourself. But here's the thing -- the Pin never gets sent to the bank or anything like that for verification. Instead the terminal simply sends the Pin to the chip embedded in the card which verifies it. If a Pin is entered three times in a row and each time fails to verify (even if used in different terminals) it locks the card so that it can't be used.

Because the chip uses cryptographic technology encoded at the hardware level, it's extremely hard to clone one. Security researchers have managed to do so but they've literally needed to use an electron microscope to reverse-engineer the circuitry, and that's still only valid for the specific chip they worked with. Basically without a hundred-grand's worth of electronics research lab you're not going to duplicate a chip &amp; pin card, whereas with mag stripe you can buy a reader/writer off ebay for less than £100.",0,1411141221,null,0,false,0,ckmther,t3_2gtnrd,t1_ckmther,t1_ckmtb5k,null,1426922002,9,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,9

1. People who complain about smokers shouldn't drive because that would be hypocritical as their car is pumping out fumes

2. People who complain about smokers should also complain about cars as cars put out just as much if not more fumes.

In any case, generally car fumes are not as bad as getting a cloud of cigarette smoke in your face. If you were standing on a empty road and a car drove by you would most likely not smell it. I certainly don't smell cars as they drive by my house. Getting a lungful of someone else's second hand smoke is a different matter.

Secondly, cars don't have a choice of where they go, those are roads, they must drive on them. Smokers absolutely have a choice to find a corner or at least stay static so that you don't piss everyone off behind you.

I remember a 4th Doctor serial where there was a race that happened to get stuck near the early time lords and basically saw them as gods/devils because the time lords tried to help him advance technologically and the planet ended up getting blown up.

Emergency services only need to have some things in common, but otherwise can be controlled by the county or state. Allowing health to be decided at state or county level would breed much more competition even if people were largely socialised, but you could see healthy capitalistic people moving to those with lower taxes and no health benefits at a much greater rate than you see the same movement outside of countries because it would be a lot easier to move within.

I'd be in favour of having two chambers, much like the have in the US. Not because US democracy/politics is great, but because I think that their bicameral system isn't the bit that's broken.

There are currently 650 MPs.

So let's say you have a lay chamber, elected for 3 year terms by first past the post. This would be the larger chamber and have 550 MPs. Like in the American system, the intention would be that these people represent the direct wishes of their local constituents. The prime minister and government would be based on the elections for this chamber. I'd be in favour of abolishing the devolved parliaments and assemblies and instead have the MPs from the lay chamber sit on regional assemblies (roughly based on the regions used for the Europea Parliament elections). They'd split their time 50/50 between the lay chamber and their regional assemblies. Devolution would be uniform for all regions.

Then you'd have the professional chamber, elected for 6 year terms by proportional representation (roughly based on the regions used for the European Parliament elections). There would only be 100 MPs in this chamber. Again, as in the American system, the idea would be that these MPs could focus on the long term good of the country, without too much fear of public opinion in the short term. Ideally, elections for this chamber would be done in halves (so you'd have an old half and a new half every 3 years), this would provide continuity.

true,mastican42,eng-northhamptonshire,Northamptonshire,"Cashback is basically a way for the service company (EE, Vodaphone etc.) to make sure that you don't quit early and to keep you in the contract. Legally, they cannot force you into a 2 year contract in case you go bankrupt or wish to quit because you're unhappy or whatever, so they put in cashback to ensure that you see out the contract and force you to void it if you quit.

I disagree with it for several reasons. First if you are a little forgetful, you may lose one or two payments, as most of the time it isn't automatic cashback and is a pain to do every few months. Secondly, I don't like the idea that you are ""forced"" into the contract and forced to remain unhappy. Of course, you can stop the contract and get your money back if you go through the whole legal side but it's a pain and often not worth the hassle to a lot of people.

I always find it a rough way of getting custom. I have always and will always opt for one without cashback for the simple reason that companies don't offer a customer something that isn't a benefit to them. Consumers won't benefit without the company benefiting even more. Cashback is just another way of this, you aren't really getting money back, you are paying more per month to get some money back that you already paid.

true,p7r,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; You seems to have forgot the London Assembly and the £14bn it gets to spend annual (as well as having local authorities with their own budgets). Manchester's councils annual budget is around £700 million.

You're comparing apples and oranges. Manchester is one borough out of ten in Greater Manchester. Its budget is £700m. The others combined bring up the budget for Greater Manchester to be equivalent to several billion pounds, for a population 1/12th that of Greater London.

The London Assembly budget (actually about £11bn) comprises budgets for transport, policing and fire services for all 32 districts of London. The City of London has its own system. In addition to that, local councils have a budget of course.

The numbers per capita are much lower in London than in Manchester for several reasons, but it has some weird effects: my council tax in LBH&amp;F is about what it was in Manchester for a similar Band D property.

&gt; To paint London as being underrepresented is a bit of a stretch. 

With 17% of the population and only 11% of the MPs London is not over-represented: it does not stand up to scrutiny with people screaming ""London-centric politics"". I think what they mean is ""middle class centric politics"" but that's not the same thing at all - I'd argue with them if that's what they said.

&gt; Also, are the buses in London still in public ownership?

No, they are all private, they must however be painted red (with a small operator logo on them, there are multiple operators) and conform to TfL's oyster-only fare structure, etc.

The French system performs better from the patient's point of view.

&gt; The big problem with private provision is that there is always an additional cost, either in quality or monetary - private provisions must make a profit.

Assuming that public institutions are 100% efficient... which they're not. Besides which, non-profit organisations are entirely welcome to be private providers. In Australia more than half of the private health insurance companies are non-profit.

&gt; Public institutions aren't run by idiots

They aren't run by giant superbrains either.

&gt; and the private sector doesn't have any magic solutions

Yes it does - competition. If you open something up to multiple providers, you can let people try different things and see what works. That's not an option with a state-run centrally planned system.

&gt; That's just economics.

No, it's a fallacy. A common one, but still a fallacy.

There aren't any.  I don't see how this is relevant, though.  The UK's problems are the UK's - they can't count on the US to bail them out by having a lower tax rate than the UK.  

&gt;Your plan to stop them is to basically tell them they can't leave, or that if they do they can't bring their money with them? ...

I'm not telling them anything, I'm raising revenues for the government.  You're trying to sensationalize something because...I'm not really sure why?  Presumably you make that much money, expect to, or are supported by someone who does.  Congrats to you.  It's not personal, it's just about addressing an economic inefficiency.  Resources are accumulating efficiently, and the only way to address that is to take action.  The free market has failed to do so for the last 30 years, so a tax is being raised to address it.  Either people continue to take ludicrous sums out of the economy, or they pay the tax - either way the goal of ensuring efficient allocation of resources is achieved.  

&gt;And you see no way that could be considered a bad thing, 

You've said repeatedly that this would be bad, but much less than providing evidence you haven't even *said why.*  What exactly would happen?  500 people would emigrate from the country?  OK?  So what?  They take their personal wealth with them?  OK?  So what?  

What exactly is it that will happen that will be bad?  

&gt;or yknow, completely fucking illegal?

Are you seriously suggesting that taxes are illegal?

&gt;It doesn't matter how much you earn. If you're getting 95% of it taken away, to me, that isn't fair.

Ah, I see the problem now.  You don't understand what a bracketed tax system is.  If I make 1.1M pounds, then I get taxed at normal rates on the income up to 500,000 pounds, then I get taxed at the 95% rate on the income over 500k.  So I earn 530k (less some more for taxes under 500k) and I pay 570k under the new tax.  Or 52%.  It's a high rate to be sure, but it's not ""unfair"" given that the average rate in the UK is something like 20-40%.   

So it's not ""terrifying"" - you're just bad at math.  

&gt;The NHS thing is just ignorance. They are allowing some services to be run by private companies. This is NOT the same thing as privatising the NHS.

[You just defined the word ""privatization"" and then put the word ""NOT"" in front of it.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization)  Yes, it actually *is* privatization.
