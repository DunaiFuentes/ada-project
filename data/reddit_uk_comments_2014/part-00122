true,bananamilk87,null,null,"I understand what you mean about the fact that people can't just turn around and pick a team to support. It's a nice concept but it doesn't mean the same as a fan who has been with the team all their lives.

I disagree that you can't be a real fan if you were born and raised away from the team. I was born in the US, but I have been raised on City all my life. My father had been a fan and raised me and my brother to be fans too. We followed the team the best we could then, not always being able to watch but following news stories, getting official magazines sent, getting information from where ever we could. I grew up in a diverse enough area that I met kids who were United fans or Liverpool fans and had to fight for my belief in my team even when they dropped down. Yes, its not the same as being in the city after a derby but I felt a burning passion all the same. 

I teared up the first time I was able to make it to the stadium, and wallowed in the fact I never got to see Maine Rd. I felt so much physical anguish that City might lose the chance at the title vs QPR that tears would not stop running down my face and that anguish turned to elation when we scored that third goal that my yell most likely scared the shit out of all my neighbors.

But I am often judged for being an American fan, and though I understand to an extent, I will never agree with that blind judgement. 

I know new fans aren't the same, but I will never discourage them.

 There is no one type of fan, and as long as we just accept that and love our team and feel that passion, isn't that all that matters?",0,1398818903,null,0,false,0,ch5jtoj,t3_24552p,t1_ch5jtoj,t1_ch4lsu7,null,1433581686,1,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"It depends what you mean by tolerance to be honest, because someone only ""tolerating"" gay people does often lead them to treating gay people differently. It implies putting up with people, and often leads to people still being marginalized. Someone tolerates a cold or a crying child, as I saw someone else put it. Say someone ""tolerates"" gay people but finds them icky, and they are a parent and their son is gay. He comes home with his boyfriend, and they hold hands, show small signs of affection that are common in relationships etc. If the parent only tolerates gay people and finds them icky, that's directly going to affect how they react to their son having a boyfriend and showing those small, normal levels of intimacy

You said as long as they don't bully or prejudice the life of gay people, but a parent finding gay people icky is definitely going to cause their child an issue in regards to bringing their partner home etc. It sounds like the same kind of ""I'll tolerate it but I don't have to like it"" thing that people would say about inter-racial relationships.

To me, tolerance seems to be the type of person who'll be cool with gay people as long as they aren't in any way reminded that they are gay. So they'll be cool with their gay mate as long as they don't have to see him holding hands with his boyfriend or giving him a kiss goodbye etc.

I do this stuff for a living, and I don't expect my nearest and dearest to make me deal with idiots when I'm doing them technical support favours.

After she moved to Plus.net they sent around an Openreach crew to dig up the road pretty much immediately, and when she had some connection problems another year or two later they opened tickets and monitored the status of her connection on their own initiative.

I'm with Eclipse Internet at home, and have been for about 12 years - they are very good, too.

You're prioritizing the right for a business to discriminate over the right of an individual to not be discriminated against. 

There are areas where there is only one affordable clothing shop. If that shop refuses to sell to Asian customers, it's naive to think that everyone will boycott the shop, as some people simply won't have the time or the money to travel further afield to buy clothes. There certainly will be people who object to it, but there will also be those who simply have to shop there due to practicality reasons. There will almost definitely be some people who would go to quite extreme lengths and make the time to shop elsewhere, but there are many who still wouldn't. If a shop refused to sell to a minority less accepted, for example trans people, there would be many who wouldn't even care. A shopowner may not like trans people, but at least under the current law they cannot be denied service there. Yes the lack of acceptance absolutely should be addressed, but providing equal access to goods and services is something that should be secured. If the only affordable hotel in the area refuses to accommodate black people, then a black person travelling into that area is screwed. 

As a bi guy, I'd much rather be able to be able to spend the night with a guy at an affordable hotel, even if the manager is a homophobe, than not be able to stay anywhere due to costs. It would obviously be much better if he wasn't a homophobe, but to have to go to a greater length than straight people to be able to find somewhere to stay is mental. It's almost universally minorities who are excluded by these ""freedom to discriminate"" laws, and to make them have to go to extra lengths to be able to access the same rights and services as everyone else is crazy.

But back to the discussion, I think its ridiculous to argue that we forced or made Gerrard slip, its just something that happened. I do agree that lucky and unlucky things do happen in a match, that is 100% true. But my point is that you can't rely on those things to help you win a match. The original post that I replied to used the logic that we beat Liverpool who were on a good run with our tactics so we could also beat RM. Again, the reason I said that this is flawed logic is that we won off a mistake that was just unlucky, the dude slipped and literally handed Ba a goal that he never would have got.

The goal vs PSG is completely different. That is a real earned goal. We put 3 forwards in the pitch and we kept putting balls in the box. It wasn't luck that he was right there when the deflection came, with all the players we put in the box and the amount of pressure we were putting on the goal something like that was bound to happen. That isn't luck, that is us playing with a tactic and having it succeed.

The media need to get over videos games. They are pretty much interactive movies. The same stories with the same bad language, sex, gore/murder scenes, just interactive in some cases.

Slips are unlucky, but mistakes can be caused by underestimating what opponents can do. Gerrard not trapping and turning well is the mistake, possibly thinking Ba is too far to make an attempt for the ball. Gerrard then realizes that he's made the mistake, but unluckily slips and screws up trying to take back control of a rolling ball. 

It's very likely that Chelsea's tactics and the style of play somehow affected Gerrard's patience forcing a mistake. A further unlucky slip on the pitch however, gave us the point. The first had to happen for the second to happen. But we wouldn't have gotten the goal if either one didn't happen.

true,IMKridegga,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"1) This was a bit of a deus ex machina moment, but it also makes a sort of weird sense.  Considering that the series had already established the power of words with The Shakespeare Code, I can believe that this same logic might rejuvenate the Doctor due to the fact that the message was broadcast by the minds of thousands of people over the Archangel Network, which was linking all of the everyone's minds to the Master, who was in the Doctor's vicinity at the time.  It's a bit of a stretch, but the only answer I can think of.

2) The was never really explained in the episode (it was explained that he was using up his life force, but it never says where these powers specifically came from in the first place).  My best guess is that they fall under a list of powers that the Master acquired in the [Classic Series Spoilers](#s ""1981 serial, The Keeper of Traken"").  Because they never defined the limitations of said powers, I've basically attributed every instance of the Master having weird powers (of which there have been several since then) to that.

3) This was done for two reasons.  The first is that with Steven Moffat's taking over as head writer, it was unlikely that any of those characters would appear again and RTD wanted to send them off with proper goodbyes.  The second is that (and this is bordering on fan speculation) he knew that this was the last time he would see them in that body and may have been afraid that seeing them in another would be inadequate.

4) It's been revealed that the Doctor can change the interior of the TARDIS whenever he wants to, and so he probably changed it as a result of his sadness about losing Amy and Rory.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"At no point did I say it was meaningless. I said it was complex and malleable. Identity formation is massively complex and is the result of personal social interaction as well as long run trends in the society itself. 

India and China also have created identities, some contested and some not. 

&gt;They still wouldn't consider me Chinese if I moved there, let alone Manchurian. And that is fine, that makes sense, and that is how it needs to work for the whole identity thing to have any meaning.

The point is that WE have a model of civic nationalism that we self-consciously invented to be inclusive. It's what the Project GB was in 1707-1747 a new nation to tie together the separate identities - thus it's called Civic Nationalism.

Let's take India, which has the same model, it has many languages and ""nations"" within its borders, it has a civic model of nationalism that unites around the idea of ""India"" that accepts dual , maybe , triple levels of identity. 

The whole point I am trying to make is that he idea of citizenship and nationalism is complex and is something that is both a personal decision along with a condition of the society around it. 

It isn't genetic, it's a created concept, thus people who argue that you can only be X because it's in your blood or  you're born into a race, are pushing an idea that really has no basis in how this country was formed, and how most other post industrial revolution states were formed. 

Have a look around ""europe"" and see how many of the states existed before 1648, 1748, 1948, 1948.

Know your rights

■ If goods are not of satisfactory quality, fit for purpose or as described, you are entitled to a refund, repair or replacement. However, you can only claim a refund for the first few weeks after purchase (the Law Commission is proposing a 30-day cut-off period) after which you are deemed to have ""accepted"" them and it's up to you to prove a manufacturing fault.

■ If you are happy with a repair or replacement within the first six months it's up to the retailer to prove that the fault wasn't there at time of purchase. After that the burden of proof reverts to you, and you have up to six years to complain. And six years might not mean six years: it all comes down to the expected durability of the goods — a grey area depending on how much the item cost, how it was described, and how much it has been used.

■ If the retailer can prove it's unfeasible or uneconomical to repair or replace they can pay ""compensation"" — which means the purchase price, minus a sum to reflect the use you've had from the goods.

Now to you. You're aware what a minority is right? If a minority is disenfranchised who comes to their aid? the mostly unaffected majority? And who organises this? Clearly that majority in this country voted for parties that enacted these laws in their behalf. It's their will either way.

I didn't claim everyone here knew each others names and we watch each others kids. There are thousands of people here, but my ""example"" is *real bloody life*. I didn't conjure the concept of council tax and local councils out of thin air. It's real stuff, it goes on...you may shockingly live under the same conditions!

No ""private"" business architected their existence on their own. They register with the government, they too pay tax, they adhere to regulations and standards as a business that runs in a first world country must. We accept government intervention in business when we don't want to be sold lead infused Chinese milk then get all ""liberty!!!"" when minority groups we're not part of have their rights stripped because we're trying to be new age internet political savvy.

You know they didn't exists at some point in this nations history and then *had* to be established because this dream of everyone being decent was complete bollocks, right? I mean this could have been as recent as your own parents lifetime. The Race Relations Act was 1965. Are your parents archaic scum bags?

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Isn't that what happens every time you take a dump in a free, public toilet or make use of a council bin, or use any council provided facilities or services when you're not in the county in which you pay council tax? 

You're suggesting the size of the rubbish involved is irrelevant? Why do you think you can't just leave stuff of any size or weight out by the bins? Or in the road?

&gt;Are these not things that non-travellers do?

Sure, it's called fly-tipping, unless you drive the stuff to the tip. None of this is news to anyone, and that's before we get to 'other people do it' not really being much of an excuse.

&gt;Sure, you're making use of facilities they've put in place, but what's stopping the council's putting facilities in place for travellers if this is to be a common occurrence?

So...rather than assume they might follow the same rules as everyone else to make this kind of thing easier/ cheaper/ more efficient, you want special provisions in place so that they don't have to. Good luck with that.

&gt;So far the main argument seems to be that it's all at the expense of the council

No, it's at the expense of everyone else who have to *pay* via the council.

&gt;but that doesn't hold much weight with me for the reason mentioned.

You haven't given any reasons - excuses that don't hold up past a single response are just that - excuses. And 'how much weight' it carries with you is irrelevant - none of this only happens 'by your leave'. It's not up to someone else to justify to you something every one else already knows, and school-level excuses don't really give you a platform of any weight to begin with. So again, good luck with that :-)

true,riskoooo,eng-essex,Essicks innit,"&gt; How is your outlook of your country? 

People are apathetic; lost in the daily grind with not much time to spare, though in typical British fashion we're still cheery and turning a blind eye to our woes. Lots of creeping xenophobia based on media misinformation; people have become far more openly racist over the past few years. The Tories have worked towards privatising many national services as a gesture of good will to their rich buddies and there's dark times ahead for the average Joe should they make further progress. They could not give a shit about us. Companies are not held to task for tax evasion while disabled people are having their welfare cancelled and in some cases dying as a result. It's a sad, sad situation, but we don't have the time to sort it!

&gt; Do you think overall it's headed in a positive direction or a negative one? 

Negative depending on who wins the election... but most likely negative regardless. I'm voting for the Green Party but it'll be a wasted vote. There's no major party who aren't embroiled enough in backdoor payments and corporate lobbying that they'd have the welfare of the people set as their priority. If healthcare and education move further towards privatisation and welfare is stripped further - some of the stories of deprivation are shocking to hear in a country as developed as ours - we'll end up with a huge wealth gap, which I think is the aim of the elite here. Private prisons; private healthcare; private education; private police. They're eking it in so people don't protest until it's too late.
 
&gt; Would you live somewhere else if you could? 

When I'm qualified I'm considering looking to teach in Canada, Sweden, Iceland, maybe Norway if we can gather the funds. Not just now. Our democratic ship is listing but there's still some time before it capsizes!

&gt; From what you know of it, do you think the US is a better or worse place to live?

Much worse as I perceive it, for the prison system, overly-enthusiastic and oppressive police/intelligence agencies, gun crime/politics, drug laws, corruption in the judiciary system, poverty and homelessness, the indifference of your ruling class... but *mainly* the healthcare system.

we havent played a high defensive line basically since a few games into sherwoods reign. kaboul basically has the same speed and tackling ability, but also gives us the physical strength and better production when dealing with aerial challenges. 

my contention, essentially, is that I prefer caulker to chiriches.

So, three officers died huh? How many people died in custody or were just randomly beaten and brutally injured on the street by these oh-so-brave heroes? 

And as for being spat on by those who you are trying to help I can give them a reason for that. They are uncaring, unsympathetic creatures just waiting to get to the next job and get it over with. I have been in a desperate situation, and all the stupid officer did was try and get to me lie to have someone who was having a full on schizophrenic breakdown arrested and thrown in a cell for a night. I refused point blank and what did this idiot do? Chew her gum in my face and say ""Well theres not a lot we can do is there?"" This is on top of the fact I never even called the goddamn police and just wanted an ambulance.

After that I have zero respect for them. Sod them all. They're a small scale military who only care about getting paid.

Since the place you are staying is a little in the other side of town, there is also **the House** in Stranmiliis, and **Cutters Wharf** right by the river if it is a sunny day.

For restaurants the **Cathedral Quarter** is also a great option (**Coppi, Le Coop, 2taps, Potted Hen**), but most of the pubs also serve delicious pub grub (not the Duke of York or the Spaniard, but the pies in Whites are amazing and sor are the mussels in Muriels) other then that everything else is near: **Made in Belfast, Mourne Seafood Bar** (best seafood dishes i've ever had), **Deanes Meat Locker, Flame Restaurant, Alley Cat**... And options for all types of cousines, and prices! :)

Closer to where you are staying I'd say **Cutters Wharf** also does great food, and there is also **The Barking Dog** and **Cafe Conor**. **The Lisburn Road** has great options, including the **Albany**! **Deane and Decano** for amazing food, **Little Wing** for pizza (also near the cathedral quarter) and **Ryan's** for the best pub + food combo ever.

Honestly, it is difficult to choose where to go in Belfast, just don't waist your time in Cuckoo! :D

true,Cycad,uk,Getting his kicks in NW6,"Oh come on, you can't discount the role of financialization and the response to the financial crisis when you are considering house prices - mortgage backed derivatives were at ground zero of the crisis! To dismiss this as ‘banker bashing’ is naive in the extreme. 

How you can possibly claim the property market is fully subject to demand and supply pressures, given the restrictions on building, government intervention and support for lending, bank forbearance and interest rates still at post-crisis 300 year lows? I could not think of a less ‘free’ market. 

&gt; the bottom line is British property has created a lot more winners than it has losers. 

Perhaps in the short term, given that  most people seem to think that rising house prices are a 'good thing'. But they are blinded by their own self interest. I was talking to a friend this morning who is looking at a tidy profit on their 1 bedroom flat, but even so they cant afford to buy even a 2 bedder within walking distance of their kids school, as that would now be north of half a million quid. The only people really benefiting are older homeowners, but an increasing generation are on the other side of the equation. Increasing house prices have allowed sucessive governments to paper over the cracks, creating a 'feel good factor' whilst disguising stagnant wages and any real long term strategy for economic growth. In the end, high house prices push up the cost of living, make the UK uncompetitive and we **all** will suffer as a consequence.

I love this country, and we have great traditions. We are in a difficult bind right now, there's no two ways about that. We're a trading nation and the global economy collapsed... so yeah. I think we need to be resolute and not pick the easy targets such as the weak and stick to our principles even if it costs us more. We have done it in the past and prospered after all.
 
* Do you think overall it's headed in a positive direction or a negatve one?

I think we're always headed in an overall positive direction, but I think the past 10 years we've stagnated as a nation. Too many compromises, too many good things rescinded. I think that the British people are too full of principle to allow this to continue indefinitely however and it will change for the better.

Yes I'd like to live in another country for a short while, maybe not forever. Maybe China?

true,AlanOC91,logo4,,"&gt; I realised when I decided to begin posting in here, that the likelihood is that match going fans would be in the minority, but I've been surprised by the extent.

Firstly, I'm glad you decided to type all this up rather than continue the way you were going. I'm a City fan from Ireland. Sure it's not America but I'm still a foreigner. As is typical with Ireland culture, you follow who your family supports. My Father follows City and thus I followed City. I take no greater joy than sitting down listening to his stories about the old days regarding the City and Ireland squads.

&gt; Also the nature of the discussion, if you're critical of a player, and even detail in depth why you feel the way you do, people have a quick read, and just downvote you.

Unfortunately this seems to be the nature of reddit, not just this sub. It's slowly turning me away from /r/soccer/ 

&gt;I think you grasp why it's difficult for a long serving blue to relate to or welcome new fans, particularly as most are only here for the success, when a blue like myself grew up during the darkest period of the club's history and suffered the ignominy of having to deal with the scum's gloating plastics, it isn't something that delights me, put it that way.

I've had this discussion with my Father recently. I told him I felt a little bit sorry for Gerrard when he slipped and that I would have felt better if it was another Liverpool player who fucked up.

He told me how much shit City fans had to put up with from not just United fans but from a lot of football fans in general when City weren't doing so good. He said one of the hardest things to ever watch is your team getting relegated and he hopes I never have to experience that feeling.

&gt;City is a community, there's no greater pleasure for me than talking City with a blue over a pint after a game. Reminiscing, talking about our future. Particularly at a European away fixture.

God how we wish we could do that here. Sometimes we feel like we are the only City fans in Ireland (I was hugely surprised that there was only 11 Irish people on this sub). We would love to sit down and have a detailed chat with people about City over a pint but we usually just get banter or grief. The majority of Ireland supports Man United and Liverpool while the rest make up the bulk of Arsenal and Chelsea. 

&gt;For a lot of these new fans, we're just a passing fad, but some even have the nerve to equate their 'support' of City with ours.

This is something I think about a lot. At what stage have City fans supported ""enough""? I'm not exactly new (I'm only fucking 22) but I like to think I know enough and have been supporting City long enough now. Although as mentioned above, I have never exactly met a ""new"" City fan in person because their is barely any of them here in the first place.

When City came to play my local club Limerick there wasn't many of us down at the hotel to meet the team which I found super fucking embarrassing. I loved that match though, I managed to get the shirt Nasri wore from that match for my 21st birthday and have it hanging on my wall with the ticket to the match.

&gt;More than 60% of people here have never even been to a game.

This I don't see as a problem. I haven't been to many games at all. Very few in fact but I would love to go to more. Unfortunately it's not as easy as that. I'm at a shitty job bridge program which is basically full time work for dole money. If I had my way I would be on a fucking plane every weekend to watch City play but I just don't have the cash to do it. I've been trying to save to get me and my Father over to one big fucking match. Maybe I will try the City v United match for next season.

&gt;Half don't even bother to watch every game on TV.

This bothers me greatly and I agree with you. I can understand if you actually can't watch the match over some awful circumstance but do your best to continually follow what has happened. This is one of the prime reasons I stay away from our Facebook page.

""Where is Aguero!?!?!"" posted 1000 times when he is injured.  

I usually blow people off easily when it comes to watching City. My mates know now that when City are playing they can either buck up and watch it with me over pints or jog on until later.

&gt;I genuinely don't think I could have much rewarding discussion or debate here. Especially on contentious topics.

I disagree but I do believe it can be improved. We need to stop downvoting when a player gets fucking criticized. Some people seem terrified to call out players like Kompany when he makes a mistake. I'm not sure if that's because they are trying hard to fit in around here but maybe we can try push it in a different direction. 

Anyway, that's my take on it.

I do think you were a bit harsh on some people here though. I can kind of understand where your coming from and maybe now you can understand the perspective of someone like me.

Heck I'm sure most new City fans are eager to learn more. I gobbled that shit up when I started supporting City. It can be infuriating when people let on they know more when they really don't but I suppose we all just have to overlook that at times. I guess it's just people trying hard to fit in and feel more comfortable around here rather than make a complete ass of themselves.

Anyway, that's my take on it! ",0,1398850388,null,0,1398850740,0,ch5uik5,t3_247v2c,t1_ch5uik5,t1_ch594ue,null,1433586790,2,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,2

Also. the engineer that eventually came up didn't bother setting up my routers or anything because and I quote (""Was not up to him, He was just here to sort the internet"")

....

after calling BT They explained that he should have. And since I set it up my self, thats why my speeds might have been slow. IF this was the case they would charge me a £130 call out fee.

OF course, It wasn't my fault. It was the cables the shit tech installed. a few were cut and giving me high pings and speed.


The tech then came out and fixed that, However since I Was 200M away from the nearest cabninet I would get 40Down 8up.

when I should be getting 80down 20 up.

I was 310M away from the cabinet in my old house and got 78Down and 13 up.

I was a Computer Games Programming student and had to suffer through Carlton McDonalds lectures for four years. He is the most incompetent and cruel person I have ever met. Before I even knew his name or who he was I had a final year student ranting for half an hour about how much of a cunt he is. The first day I met him he provd it to be true... and continued proving it every single meeting after that. I've NEVER met anybody who has anything nice to say about him; ever. Even his own colleagues who lecture on CGP were insulting him to students because he is so incompetent, rude and cruel.

Just after I finished studying I find out that the two leaders of my course, John Sear and Adam Russell were forced out of their jobs because the approval rating for CGP went from 100% (I'm not exaggerating) to something like 90%. Mostly due to modules like Carltons being forced onto them in addition to the 'games' modules.

Because this was a 'downward trend' they used it against them. Ignoring the fact that other courses have MUCH lower ratings. All they cared about was the trend... and since from 100% you can only go down... they were forced out for political reasons. 

The real reason, I've heard, is that they refused to let more students onto the degree and refused to dumb it down to the point that 2/3rd of the students wouldn't fail. John and Adam always said they taught to the standard required to get a job. End of story. If you fail, tough shit, you're not good enough. And it worked, almost everyone has employment in their chosen field who graduated when they were in charge.

Any institute who suffers a prick like Carlton McDonald to continue having employment and fires two outstanding lecturers for bullshit reasons is just a joke.

It ends up being no more specific than humanity. And the faster it changes, the less specific it is, as the dampening effect from the previously present culture is lessened.

This is generally fine from the point of view of the migrant. They chose that (although I would guess a lot of them wished they were part of a stream more than a flood). The end result is that the identity of those that formed the host culture changes and becomes weaker without their permission.

""realistic transfer fee"" - I think you've gone mad. There are few reasonable transfers around now, particularly for younger players unless they are on contracts that are ending. Shaw has a contract up till 2018 and plenty of clubs want him. Who wants him? I'm sure that City, Liverpool (Enrique too injury prone, Cissokho is wank, Flanagan is decent but not good enough at the moment, I rate Shaw higher, also similar to azpi - flanagan is a right back..) , Chelsea (Cole contract expiring, he can rotate with Azpi and allows them to play Shaw-X-Ivanovic/x-Azpi), and of course they have the money for it, Manchester United (Evra out, Buttner eh) and that is before considering Tottenham or any of the real big spenders from around the world who could opt to pick him up and do what I said above, play him or most likely, loan him back out to an English club for a while.

And we are heavily dependent on house prices, consumer spending and not manufacturing. Which its ironic to be pissy about really, I'm not a fan either, but mention a time before 1996 when they was not the case. 

It's getting a bit sad that, the government is basically being blamed for declaring missions accomplished because thats what a lot of the media is doing.

It might be the start of the end finally, largely because the world markets are getting their confidence back by and large, we are in a pretty good position here as have one of the best credit ratings around. 

Massive amouts of expansionary spending into high-tech industries is the way to go and thankfully we are able to do that without devaluing the currency too much.

We also need frankly to start retraining people by the thousands. The labour market has lots of niche skill sets that we don't need anymore. People also frankly need to get ready to move around a hell of a lot more.It's all good to bitch and moan about London and the South east, but London and Cambridge especially are actually doing things the world wants. Hell Cambridge is starting to ramp up in a way that it might start becoming a serious competitor for the worlds most important tech hub. 

Frankly, we need to stop sitting around as a nation and moaning that the economy is not personally benefiting us and how we should get everything we want, as we are right now. I went back to university and learned to code, moved across the country too why? Because I'd tried to train to be a policy adviser in scotland, and we don't fucking need that.

Far too much of this 'I want everything to be like it was before the crash now, with all the excesses of the boom back and my life to be just as I want it'. It's just not the way the world is anymore.

yeap the oil's fucked, not so sure on fracking, but im skeptical about how good an idea that is given we are so densly populated and allready sitting on a criss cross of mines in so many places. 

Our dependence on cars, gotta go. So we've got to unfuck the train network, massive investment needed.

Got to get back into nuclear, soon as possible to provide a backbone for the renewables (alterantive solutions are either a natural gas backbone, what we are doing now, or complex storage mechanics like gravity revisoirs, which we don't really have to space to build more on top of what we've allready got). 


One quater petrostate, one quater service economy and half finacial center, has basically been the plan up until this point. 

Bleating about manufacturing, when a lot of the fall is due to the fact we simply cannot compete with low-tech manufacturing in east asia, is another good example of how this 'assessment' is just bullshit. 

We need to play to our edges, unfortunately finacial services in london, is one. ashewing that is stupid. 

but we've also got a burgeoning bioinformatics and medical technology industry that needs fostering. 

Not to mention ARM in cambridge has to be one of the greatest success stories in British history that is making a high tech hub slowly emerge around it.

And if rising house prices free's up some of the lending and that enables that a bit. So be it. A move back to throwing everything back into the building industry though would be a terrible idea.

The art style is a sort of 'photo-cartoon', a bit like animation made from magazine clippings.

The music is a song sung by a child's voice - 'It's time for hope and action, to set our people free, tell them all just where to go, by voting BNP.' to the tune of 'All Things Bright and Beautiful'. I can't quite make out the verses, but lines include 'some come for operations, some to steal our work', and other things about immigrants coming to steal 'our' jobs and benefits and destroy our country.

It opens with a bulldog sitting by someone's couch, watching an old Nigel Farage speech on TV, in which he asserts that UKIP are not against immigration.

This bulldog then runs off and watches a series of events depicting the BNP's warped vision of Britain today: the main party leaders freely letting immigrants in, immigrants looting, stealing jobs, drink-driving and harassing young girls, etc etc. These immigrants are all portrayed as either wearing hoodies or traditional conservative Islamic dress. Mosques rise from the ground, and high-street shops are replaced with Halal butchers and other 'immigrant businesses' (??) wherever they step.

There's a particularly odd recurring theme of a penguin trying to get into our country (while the songs says something like 'Our country's open to all who have no feathers and two legs'). At one point, an Islamic suicide bomber sneaks past as police are checking the penguin's paperwork. Later on, said penguin is seen disguised in a Burqa.

The dog encounters a BNP parade, and Nick Griffin pets it. Then real Nick Griffin appears on screen:

""I'm sure you enjoyed that, but the issues raised are deadly serious, and affect us all - just listen to people like you:""

Then a parade of terrifying white British reptiles are presented to say things like

'British jobs for British workers! When the BNP say it, they mean it mate!'

and

'Only the BNP will put British youth first, prioritising social housing, and making sure British jobs go to us, British workers of the future!'

&gt; It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl.  It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities.  It counts Whitman's rifle and Speck's knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. 

&gt; Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play.  It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials.

What does this mean? Britain used to be the world's leading exporter for cars and such, UKIP, I believe, want to bring the industry back to Britain, creating jobs and bringing money into the country. 

What is Cameron doing? Lowering the cost of beer so the common man can relax after a hard days work (and yes that was on a promo poster, maybe not those exact words). That's not going to sort out this country. 

Just because there are people out there that want to make Britain an empire again, doesn't mean they want all other races out of the country.

Suddenly the 'rising tide lifts all boats' argument isn't valid. 

This is just an economic fact: we are no longer in the productivity-compensation regime where one could rationally hold such opinions.

The downsides of economic inequality - from increased social disorder (see 'The Spirit Level') to reduced purchasing power and the death of the mass-market economy (Citigroup infamously planned for the growth of a new luxury-focused 'Plutonomy') - are well known.

Everyone should want to address these issues because ultimately a sinking ship drowns captain and crew alike.

true,Rukooo,lfc99,,"&gt; I am not going to sit around arguing over this beyond this answer

Then why post here? If you are not going to validate/discuss the arguments you put forth, then just don't contribute. 

&gt; We cannot afford having a specialist role that is only focusing on delivering 3 tackles and 2 interceptions per game, we need more adaptable players.

How long have you been watching Liverpool play? How long have you been watching Lucas play? For that matter how long have you been following football? Because the fact that you say Lucas is just a ""specialist"" focusing on ""delivering 3 tackles and 2 interceptions per game"" shows that it can't be for too long. Before Gerrard got moved to CDM role, Lucas was phenomenal before his injuries. He would break up any dangerous counter-attacks. He would shut down other teams creative players. He single handily kept out Silva throughout the whole game when we played City couple of years back. 

This season he has been riddled with injuries, and coming back took him couple of games to regain his sharpness. However, soon as he was 80-90% fit he slotted back into starting 11 without a problem. Forcing Rodgers to play him in the midfield with Gerrard as pair. That's how good he is. He earned his place back in a team that was on good form and winning without him.

Now let's look at Lucas when Gerrard was not playing due to injury. Maybe you recall the game we had against Tottenham at WHL where we demolished them 5 - 0. All without Gerrard and all with Lucas playing in his role. Even against City where we lost 2-1, he was instrumental in shutting down their offensive options. They managed to score from a corner if I recall correctly and a mistake by Mignolet. We were on top that game, we gave City one of the hardest games at their own stadium, all without Gerrard and with Lucas filling his role. 

Gerrard won't be around for much longer and keeping Lucas is vital in replacing him. You need to keep experienced players in the team, especially players that have been loyal, hard-working and around for 7+ years. Maybe you want a CM not a CDM for pace, energy and creativity. Because you'll have a hard time finding a more efficient and game-changing CDM than Lucas. 

&gt; we cannot have one player doing that then the team as a whole needs to step up, like we have seen Coutinho and Sterling doing in the last months. Coutinho is up to 2.4 tackles per game and Sterling is around 1.5 I think.

This just shows your lack of understanding of football. Those tackles are made when we put pressure on teams with possession and very few cases when we are defending in formation with 8+ players behind the ball. Lucas makes his interceptions and tackles majority of the time on counter attacks. Breaking up plays and tracking their most threatening offensive midfield options. You seriously don't think its Cout or Sterling that tracks back to break up counter-attacks and make tackles. It's Lucas who hangs back, allowing our attacking players to go forward.

In the end if you've been watching Lucas play for the last 5+ years you'd appreciate the important role he plays in the team and how fucking good of a player he is.

This is so outdated it's unreal, as someone has pointed out in a comment above this one. The reason that China/wherever gets these industrial jobs is because they can offer the services for less money than anyone in Britain can dream of. How do they do this? They have piss-poor safety and pay next to nothing to their workers. You will not get the business back in Britain without either following suit, or **heavily** subsidising the industries, which is completely counter productive. For the same money you should be innovating new industry and business, not propping up industry which is dying for good reason.

&gt; For example, where I work we have just taken on an older Spanish woman as a cleaner (I know, irony), but she does her job well, for the same pay as her fellow workers, and has to get up 4 am every morning to start, I am willing to bet my paycheck every week that there are people here that have just said fuck that, or 4 am? I can't get up at that time. We'll she can, that's why she has the job and you don't. 

I remember a news report from a few months back on regional tele. They went down to the job centre and interviewed people signing on about their thoughts on people ""taking the jobs"". Obviously they spouted the usual shite about how all the Eastern Europeans are taking the jobs, leaving none for British people. The reporter then asked about the jobs that were being taken, around here it's mostly farm work and other manual labour tasks. The biggest source of jobs that Eastern Europeans  were doing in the area was picking in the fields. A bus would pick them up from town in the morning at 4-5AM, they'd pick produce from the fields all day and then they'd get a lift back to town for 6 in the evening, all for minimum wage. No-one they interviewed would even consider that as a job, they just discarded it offhand, but somehow still insisted that it was the immigrants fault they couldn't find work.

true,_njd_,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"UKIP are still a minority party but they have an enormous influence at the moment, because they are tapping into a growing ... um ... xenophobia after several years of recession. They are also big enough to split the Tory vote at the next election, so the Conservatives are at least frightened by them.

People see their pay stagnating, but house prices are rising because not enough new homes have been built to accommodate the growing population. Other prices are still rising too, so people are feeling worse off, not better. 

But slightly more than half of the population increase is from immigration; it used to be a fairly even split between new births and new immigrants (though you'd rarely see the right-wing Press acknowledge natural increase), but there aren't so many people emigrating to Europe as there were a few years ago - and many of them are returning to the UK - so migration is a bigger part of it. Immigration - or at least the perception of it - is a particularly big issue for people on relatively low wages who feel their jobs are more threatened by competition from immigrants.

Immigration used to be classic Tory territory when they were in opposition, but now that they're in power and hoping to stay there, they're aiming more for the political middle-ground, leaving immigration to minority parties like UKIP, who are attracting a lot of Conservatives and undecided voters.

UKIP have had some spectacular gaffes recently, but this only seems to increase their profile. With every UKIP member sacked for antediluvian attitudes towards women or gay rights, UKIP seems to become more hated by its critics and more liked by its supporters. And either way, Farage and his party is getting talked about.

Easy to say to you, a person living in your own country. It's not nice when mass media make whole campaigns with certain bias and don't get me wrong, if they indeed had merits I would have to shut up.

&gt;Supporting parties like UKIP doesn't mean you 'don't like' immigrants, that's a very short sighted analysis.

Not always, I agree but often. Campaigning British jobs for British people gives a clear message, a British job is not to be given to me. What's next, British health system and the following rest?

UKIP isn't Nazi but they often give views not very much different from what Nazis had, especially at their first steps into power.

Not really, it doesn't work like that. I will never get rid of my accent and often people do indeed see facial differences between Brits and other white immigrant groups.

Topsham is very nice. Great selection of pubs and cafes, good antiquing (so I'm told, can't stand shops full of old junk myself but there you go!), regular train into Exeter, regular ferry across the river to Starcross, Dawlish, and Turf Locks ([The Turf](http://www.turfpub.net/) is well worth a visit on a nice day!), and a generally very well presented little town.  

Ide is also a very nice place. Perhaps not as well connected to Exeter and the surrounding, but has some quality pubs!

Crediton (where I grew up) is an ex-market town, and has had a bit of a decline on the highstreet over the last 20-30 years. Good selection of pubs however (I highly recommend the Three Little Pigs!), and there's a slow rise of little boutique shops (e.g. The Cheese Cafe, Crediton Coffe Roasting house etc.). Get there on the right weekend and you'll get the farmers market to explore as well. In all honesty, I probably wouldn't recommend this town.. Very much a commuter town now, trying to beat out an existence with specialist boutiques etc.. 

Sidmouth (where I'm living currently) is a lovely place to visit. Really set up as a retirement/holiday destination so there's plenty of shops to potter about in, however not a lot of other entertainments.. Small town full of old people after all! No trains, so it's buses or driving. Though it's only about 20 mins into Exeter, and 20-30 mins out towards Lyme Regis if you fancy fossil hunting etc...

Agree. Serve jail time here, then back to where you came from. I don't see what is unreasonable about this. I don't see why we would want criminals to stay here.

No. If people were given citizenship, you can't revoke it. That's bullshit.

Terrible idea. Would be better to apply the criteria we already have set up for non-EU immigration and to better enforce the ""family"" rules. It's kinda bullshit that Brits who marry foreigners have such a hard time, but many immigrants can bring over wives, aunts, uncles, cousins and all sorts.

Kinda interesting, but I'm not sure how that's feasible. Though I do think the asylum thing is full of fraud. How do you flee a dangerous country in fear for your life and end up in the UK? That can't be very common.

Government: ""We're starting a scheme to give long-term unemployed people valuable skills by giving them incentives to do voluntary work with community groups, charities and other non-profits"".

Unite: ""We are urging charities not to support this scheme as we consider it to be ""workfare""""

It's pretty obvious that the unions are putting the short-term job security of their members above the long-term viability of their industries. The modern trade union movement is a mixture of socialists/marxists who believe that all private enterprise is evil and should be driven into bankruptcy so the state is forced to take over and short-term opportunists who just want to milk as much money into their salaries/pensions as possible, with no concern for the next generation.

There are many other examples of this sort of thinking, for instance the rejection by the unions of the plan to save Grangemouth oil refinery, forcing its closure, despite less than half the actual workforce being opposed to the plan.

And then there's the ongoing London Underground dispute; almost entirely about showing that the RMT is still ""strong"" despite the loss of its leader (as well as an expression of the union's internal power struggle).

A majority government can be elected by 33% of the vote, that means that 66% of the vote possibly did not want them in at all. When you counter in people voting 'against-favour' instead of for then it is even less. 4% of those 33% for example voted for the 'lesser of two evils'.

I dont think that is possible against a 9 man defence. The two layers of defence were very close to each other, even merging sometimes. What I would have liked to see more was Liverpool attacking through the flanks with overlaping full backs. Simple one twos releasing either the winger or the full back. Raheem Sterling should have played on the right to take advantage of Ashley Cole.

Lessons learnt -
We need a left footed left back to stretch their defence even more.
We need a better cover for Henderson.


All in all, this was the first time Rodgers was put in such a situation against a strong defence and he will be put into them again especially with CL next season. I am sure we will be better prepared next time!

_Tend_ to be? That's weasel words if I've ever heard them. In this case, with long-term unemployment, having _anything_ recent on the CV is a massively valuable thing. Large empty spaces on CVs make employers nervous. Unemployment benefits are supposed to be a ""safety-net"" they are not supposed to be relied on in the long-term. People on long-term unemployment benefits need to either be transferred to incapacity-related benefits, where appropriate, or placed on training courses or work experience programmes. The longer the ""empty space"" on the CV, the harder it is to get them back into work.

&gt; all unions try to do and have done in the past it improve conditions for future workers

Maybe 50+ years ago. That sort of spirit is virtually completely dead these days. Why aren't the unions taking a stand against actual issues, such as the widespread abuse of ""zero-hour"" contracts? Why is USDAW (the largest retail union, where most of these types of contracts exist) so conspicuously quiet while so many of their members suffer such abuse? Is it because the modern TUC won't support action to support such ""low-level"" workers?

We can all name the RMT, Unite, Unison, the NUT, etc. because they're the ones that make the most noise. The other thing they have in common is that the vast majority of their members are paid above-average salaries, hold hard-to-get qualifications and are largely middle-class (although I'm sure the unions would oppose the use of that term to refer to them).

Well there's probably a lot of factors that come into play there. I'd imagine they'd be looking at if there is any traffic behind or beside the person, if someone is right up your arse and you can't change lanes you're going to have a hard time backing off from the person in front of you but if there's absolutely nobody behind you for miles and you're tailgating the person in front, that's pretty clear cut. I don't think the police will be looking at someone for 2 seconds and making a judgement based on that.

&gt;Do the police prioritise prosecution of tailgating above prosecution of hogging the passing lane? 

Absolutely no idea.

&gt;""Once at speed these things do not slow down quickly"".. ..well, you say that...

That video is all well and good, but what if the HGV tailgating you doesn't have this braking system? What if the system does not work for that one time?

By being so anti immigration (or picky with immigration) we are sending a negative message to the rest of the world. I definitely understand the benefit of reducing immigration but we cannot have offensive billboards like that one or the go home vans or all other anti immigration advertising while also saying ""if you're highly skilled come to our country and pay us taxes because we'd love to have your support"". 

I'm not suggesting we have open borders because that's not sustainable, I also don't think we can accept every unskilled immigrant that comes here either. Similarly, though, we can't be so picky. Skilled immigrants will see us as an intolerant nation and will not want to uproot to live somewhere where they may get treated badly, also, unskilled immigrants can in future become skilled and start contributing. 

[This paper](http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/people/staffPapers/vivek/Vivek_Losing_the_best_and_brightest.pdf) (which should be taken with a grain of salt!) ([its summary on business week here](http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2009/tc20090318_162454.htm)) talks about this problem. This is about foreign students attending american universities to study the sciences and then leaving after graduation instead of remaining and helping develop their economy. There are a number of reasons why this would happen and you can't just blam immigration policy for this. At the same time, if UKIP were a leading political party skilled and unskilled immigrants would think twice before coming here. 

I also think that we should be proud to be a relatively supportive country with great healthcare and a safety net and think that it would be nice to help others but that's just my own naive belief and can't really argue for it beyond saying it's a nice thing to do.

The simple fact is that the rapid growth in the housing market made a lot of ordinary people fairly well off. If you bought a house in the 80's for £10,000, it can easily be worth £300,000 now. That's peoples' retirements and their security for millions of people in the middle class or the UK.

&gt; forcing people to take useless unpaid work in exchange for having a basic safety net

That's not what I said. Not even close. People on unemployment benefits long-term are obviously in need of assistance. People should not be forced to be on that sort of benefit long-term. Whether that be work placements, education or re-assessment onto incapacity-type benefits, help starting a business or even help re-locating to another area of the country where there are better job prospects, whatever (within reason). We, as a country, have an obligation to provide this assistance, call it a moral duty or just plain human decency.

However, if people refuse such assistance and show no initiative of their own, there should be consequences. Claiming unemployment benefit while making no effort to find work or even actively avoiding work is tantamount to benefit fraud and should not be tolerated.

As someone who seems to have ""left"" leanings, please explain to me why we, as a nation, should fund people who choose not to work, to ""pull their own weight"" as a lifestyle choice?

Not really. When you look into details you will find that UKIP bases their ""facts"" on scaremongering rather than actual decisions. If they advocate so much that EU isn't democratic, why they don't say with a single word about the UK's House of Lords, about political parties voting within them to chose a leader (who if party wins election become PM) or the simple fact of having the Queen, however no president? If you analyse how EU works it is actually very democratic, although I have to admit bit confusing (but presumably because you can't solve easily some highly complex issues like that).

How about plenty of other things UKIP stands for (or did in the past)? Like opposing smoking ban (yeah, very democratic for non-smokers to work in smoking environment). Not saying about the opposition to man made global warming.

It needs a decent quality synthetic engine oil - putting any old crap in is a quick way to wreck it.

It is an interference engine, so if the timing belt has not been replaced at the specified age or distance, you need to get it done.  This is about 2h work or so from what I remember at a reputable mechanic - they will replace tensioners etc at the same time.  If you neglect this, and the timing belt snaps, you can kiss all the valves and likely the entire engine goodbye.

The power steering unit is hydraulic and can go with age, but you should be able to find replacements online.

The aircon can go with age, as can the alternator, you will be able to find replacements online.

We should've been protecting ourselves deeper at all times, Gerrard should never have been the last man while we were in possession of the ball in the first half.

We had no reason to go all-in to start that game.  I completely understand that we want to play a certain way and that we've torn just about everyone apart doing so this season.  But Mourinho is a specialist at killing a game like the one we want to play, he has a long and very decorated history of doing exactly that.  What's more is that Rodgers worked under him and surely is well aware of this.  We were stubborn in our refusal to adapt to a situation and we got burned for it.  One of the major reasons that Mourinho has had such a decorated career so far is because he's not afraid to change at a moments notice to address the situation in front of him.  We need to learn from that and be smarter next time.

I'm not saying we should have played for a draw.  I'm saying that we could have been looking to win he game without overextending ourselves from the start.

Pounds, not dollars, and frankly because multiculturalism has a wide range of economic and social benefits to the UK, including businesses started by immigrants which become popular with the British population (Nandos etc etc), social cohesion which allows better understanding of different cultures and lowers the prevalence of racism in the society. Those against multiculturalism are quite often old, middle to upper class white British people who don't like the idea of living on the same road as someone who isn't white. 

The Human Rights Act also safeguards our freedom of expression, religion and conscience, as well as existing human rights. I don't see a problem with asylum seekers who have pasts that may be criminal, because if the country that they committed those crimes in wanted to convict them, then all they need to do is either file an extradition request with safeguards for the person's detention, or if it's a war crime or they can't be extradited, submit evidence to the ICC, who will try said asylum seeker. 

For the specific case you've shown, why on earth the immigration tribunal granted him asylum after finding him guilty is beyond me. He should have been held in detention until extradited with safety guarantees and tried in his own country. However...

&gt;The war criminal will now be allowed to remain in this country indefinitely. He cannot claim benefits, work or study and the only controls that can be placed on him is a reporting requirement.

Benzema is a wonderful striker who doesn't quite get the acclaim he deserves at Real because Ronaldo is so massive (and now Bale as well).  He works his ass off for the players around him on both ends of the pitch and is a very strong finisher.  He's willing and able to contribute to the buildup play and set players up as well.

The reason I'd be asking for £50mil on top of Benzema (who is probably a £30-35mil striker) is that we want the cash most, but Benzema is definitely one of the best options we'd have for filling the vacant striker position.  Think of it as getting £70mil for Suarez and then immediately buying Benzema at a cutprice deal for £20mil.

Why do you think people ONLY find gay men ""icky"" and not lesbians""? Do you think maybe it's because they never actually see men being sexual together, whereas women being sexual together becomes a number one music video?

Do you think people finding men kissing ""icky"" is because they never see it? In all 8 series of Will &amp; Grace there was absolutely NO gay action at all.

So even though it looks like you're being exposed to homosexuality, you're not. You're still sensetized to it.

Actually that's not why I said that.

Its impracticable because....its not always practical or safe to pull over. And how often do you pull over. For every car? What problems might a cyclist face when trying to rejoin traffic in a city or town. Will a cyclist actually be able to make any progress?


What about cycle boxes at the start of all lights. Going to start fining cyclists for using them if a car has to wait for a safe spot to overtake?



&gt;good start would be formal tuition, a test / license for a cycle, same as cars and motorbikes need.

Got bad news for you. Training already exists. And they teach cyclists to ride in primary for a bunch of reasons. They recommend by default cyclists should cycle 1 meter from the curb at all times also.

If you want cyclists out of your way, best hope formal training never happens.

But anyway....formal training will never happen. People might want it but it still wont happen. There are many good reasons for this.

true,koptimism,lfc99,,"Suggestions like this are naive and don't work. Steve Clarke coaches a different style to Rodgers - compact defending, a relatively deep defensive line, not much pressing. That naturally limits their attacking prowess at the other end, because their players are closer to their own goal when they get the ball, have more to do, and even though there's space for them to counter-attack into, there's fewer players in counter-attacking positions. Mourinho's style is similar; he gets away with it because his wide players have excellent physical and technical qualities - hence why they cost ~20m+.

Rodgers has his own defensive style - pressing from the front as a unit, a DM dropping between the CB's to allow the fullbacks to go forward, and a higher defensive line. We've seen it work really well at times this season - our pressing against Arsenal at Anfield was gorgeous. But it's a very demanding defensive style - each player is covering more ground and has more individual responsibility. That's why individual errors are more costly for us than they are for teams that are compact.

If Steve Clarke came back as our defensive coach - and why would he, since he's had his go as a manager now and it'd be a huge step down - and was allowed to put his system in place, then we'd be less effective on the counter-attack, and our fullbacks would never get as far forward as they currently do, meaning we'd lack width in attack.

The real answer is to continually improve the individual quality of our defensive unit through transfers and Rodgers' coaching. Occasionally its Rodgers' fault tactically - when Norwich switched to 4-5-1 and overloaded our flanks, and when Man City did the same with Milner, we took too long to respond to the changes.",0,1398866429,null,0,false,0,ch5yfnj,t3_24cy91,t1_ch5yfnj,t1_ch5w6hz,null,1433588703,16,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,16

I'm fine as I know how to use the road and bike properly, but it's nuts and dangerous.

It could be a horse, tractor or pedestrian round that corner. Its the primary reason the highway code asks you to drive at a speed that you can stop safely stop in.

But cyclists have a problem with bends on such roads...

If they single out they become a whole lot harder to see. And if someone comes round said corner going to quick they are fucked. If they cycle away from the edge you stand a better chance of being seen.

You will also find cyclists riding 2 abreast on country roads. They do this for a few technical reasons, but also due to safety. If they single out and allow cars past (like I have many times with other cyclists) cars see a gap and go for it. And on blind bends this is suicidal for the motorist and cyclists. As on occasions the car has to panic and pull back in, often into a group of the cyclists.

I'm pretty sure most motorists fail to realist this. Or maybe don't care.

We simply wouldn't have achieved what we'd achieved this season if we were still a team that was set up to go defensively toe-to-toe tactically with Jose's Chelsea this season given our current squad depth.

The biggest failure was a) an incredible bit of bad luck coupled with a blind-siding mistake and b) trying to claw our way back with innefective attacking methods (long shots and easy-to-make crosses from our largely unmarked fullbacks) rather keep trying to do what's hard and attack how we know best.

It's a huge set back but it's a test that was required and a lesson we need to learn if we want to have any success deep into the Champions League next season because teams will come at us and try to shut us down like that and we need to figure out a way to deal with it without getting embarrassed like Bayern did last night and Barca did last year... hopefully we will come away from this a better team and Rodgers has shown already how capable he is for learning on the job and making the tweaks needed to continue to grow and succeed.

edit: As one of the countless post-game podcasts I've listened to said (I honestly have lost track which one), it would have been really interesting to see what Chelsea actually would have done after half time if the error hadn't been made and the game was still 0-0.  It probably would have been a serious test for Mourinho (particularly to just see if he was willing to sit back and take a draw), the game would have likely opened up more (which would have obviously have been to our favour). 9 times out of 10 this would have been a different game and more than anything it's just heartbreaking for Stevie.  The real test now is to see if we can end the season strongly in the face of this adversity, I'd still be happy if we made a real go for it and continued to show character.

true,ddosn,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,""" foreign workers in the UK contribute MASSIVELY to the economy. Not taking away, all things considered. We need them. ""

But we have to differentiate between them.

No one, whether they be UKIP, the Cons, Labour, Lib Dems or the normal people, have no problem with high skilled workers (engineers, scientists, surgeons, consultants, doctors, specialists etc) coming to the UK to work.

The vast majority of the immigrants from Europe, the Anglosphere and many commonwealth nations fit this group. They come here because they are specialists trying to fill a hole in the UK job sector as the UK has not yet trained enough people to fill the holes yet. They come here as they have secured jobs here already and they come here to work.

They are skilled professionals and specialists, so of course these people are going to be in general better educated and pay more tax as the vast majority (if not all) will have been to university and will have better wages (and thus be in a higher tax bracket meaning they pay more tax).

Comparing a group almost entirely made up of professionals and specialists to the population of the UK (which includes everyone from homeless and drug addicts to surgeons and scientists), of course they are going to seem like they pay more tax, are better educated etc.

But, as i said above, no one is talking about professionals and specialists, they are talking about unskilled labour.

Like cherry picking, or hand car washing.

Unscrupulous employers will not want to pay the good wages and provide the good working conditions most Britons would want, so they import and/or employ immigrants they can take advantage of by forcing them to work in terrible conditions for peanuts.

What UKIP says is technically right. Immigrants are been picked over Britons because immigrants are easier to take advantage of.

Of all the players on the squad (in my opinion) he really seems to be the one who is most visibly showing the effects of the management situation(s).


Under AVB he had his small moment of voicing his discontent at LB but seemed to put his head down and work.

Under Sherwood we have seen Paulinho have his moment of frustration, Sandro, Capoue have had theirs. Jan had his moment as well (though reading the interviews where he said he ""wants to leave"" his statements don't actually say that and seem to be the press twisting words to make a story), but his form did seem to dramatically drop once Sherwood became manager.

I really wonder how he will react to a new manager, as he is the one (with the limited insight we actually have into the club) that seems to have been dramatically impacted by the management situation this year.

i also don't like the idea that because someone's job is 'dumb' they are less worth of having it, which seems to sorta be implied. without wanting to sound too harsh here, some people are only capable of doing jobs at that lower end, why should they suffer or be told they aren't good enough to have a job? all that does is create more people for the tabloids to demonise.

That's not the point here. Whether through refugee status, asylum, marriage, illegal entry, or legitmate visa, an immigrant is an immigrant. It's one more person added to the labor pool. That's the point.

You are asking about ""net migration"" and the answer was right there in the BBC link I gave you. 

&gt;Very few countries can actually claim asylum.

You can correct me if there's been a recent change that I'm not aware of, but as far as I know it has nothing to do with what country you are from per se. You only have to demonstrate why you are afraid to go back there. But it matters little anyway, because an asylum seeker can claim he's from anywhere. It's extremely easy, for example, for an African to claim he's from Sierra Leone instead of Ghana  because many asylees come without any passports or documentation.

true,FrenchyFungus,null,null,"&gt;But isn't a flat tax rate fairer?

Not really. The more wealth a person has, the more efficiently they can use their money. For example, if someone is able to afford a car, they might be able to drive to the next town over and make use of the larger supermarket there to reduce their grocery bill, whilst the person who can't afford the car ends up spending even more money on their shopping.

Another example: 
&gt;“The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.
&gt;
&gt;Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.
&gt;
&gt;But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.
&gt;
&gt;This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”

They describe themselves as an objective body which does ""studies"".

They probably don't like but they just make wrong assumptions while at the same time forget about other, which should matter. Getting information out of context can mean anything, even when taken from most liberal or democratic piece of writing/rules etc.

true,Helpopotamus,lfc87,,"Yeah, his versatility and work-rate are huge bonuses to his already amazing creativity. Rodgers often talks about creating good footballers, not nailing people to a role. So I agree that Rodgers managerial style sounds like it would compliment Lallana hugely.

I think where there are some reservations (not my own) are in we're all too experienced with buying big fishes from a small pond and finding they can't quite cut it at the top end.

Personally, I believe Lallana would be potentially our best signing of the summer if we manage to get him. He's already proven in the league, has the maturity of leading his own club and would have worked with the majority of our senior players at the club when he goes to the world cup this year. Southampton also play a similar style to what Rodgers uses meaning he should integrate well with our philosophy. We need depth badly, and having the choice of rotating the likes of Sturridge, Suso, Sterling, Coutinho, Borini and Lallana and having one come off the bench would invaluable. 

He's clearly dedicated to Southampton however, and I never truly believe reports until I see Zaf's hands on their topless torso.

Because the people who's jobs are being displaced are the sort of people who are too poor to move around, and that migrants taxes end up paying for the economically inactive anyway, thereby completely wiping out the benefit of importing them. 

The average tax take per person per year is £9000. This calculator: http://www.minimumincome.org.uk/results for a single person with no children says the minimum required net income to survive is £14,196. Therefore for every immigrant taking the job of a British person, there is a net loss in pure monetary terms. However, this assumes that the average migrant pays average tax, which they would not. In fact, they probably pay no tax at all and are in receipt of benefits themselves, due to working at minimum wage and having a family back home.

They work harder and for less, fantastic! But for every person out of work who requires welfare to survive you need 1.5 average tax payers to support them.

Real journalists don't make up stories ever. Bullshit websites like goal.com and tabloid rags are not journalism, and you shouldn't believe their stories even if they DO have quotes.

Even legit outlets do occasionally get stories wrong, of course, either because they were lied to by sources, or because the sources then lied in public to discredit the story. For example:

&gt;Griezmann released a statement denying even speaking with PSG.

OK, so he claims he hasn't spoken with PSG...why should that automatically mean you believe him? I'm not saying he is going to PSG or that there's anything true about that particular story, just saying that this kind of thing happens quite often:

1. Journalist gets insider info on story from reliable source (off the record or on background)

2. Journalist publishes story

3. Club or player sees story, goes ""fuck, we didn't want people to know that""

&gt; deaths of people detained under the Mental Health Act (MHA) and those in prison custody account for 92% (N=5,511) of all deaths in state custody, at 61% (N=3,628) and 31% (N=1,883) respectively

Meaning only 8% (487) of those deaths were in the custody of Police officers.

Demonising immigrants and closing our borders is a completely impractical and counter-productive solution to the problem.  Although it seems counter-intuitive, the actual solution is to address the wage imbalance between immigrants and local population - why is an immigrant being paid £13,000 a year to do a job that a British person would be paid £20,000 a year to do?  Measures should be taken to disincentivise employers from paying an immigrant less than they would offer a British person. This would for starters address the tax issue (it wouldn't address the fact that a British person with a family pays more tax than an immigrant with a family back home - but I personally think that is already balanced out by the fact that the family back home aren't using British resources).  Additionally this will mean that the employment process goes back to hiring people based on their merit and not on how likely they are to accept less pay.

Another thing to do is to close all the tax loopholes.  Yes, millionaires are within their legal right to dodge tax if the system allows it - but that only means that the system shouldn't allow it.  The fact that Britain lost £1bn in taxes to a single person is a travesty.  That £1bn would have been more than enough to maintain the welfare state at a more comfortable budget.

The guy is a striker and a very good one, so let's all rubbish him like what happened to Lucas, Henderson, etc.  It's complete nonsense.  Does he always make the best decisions?  Of course not, no footballer does.  Does he make the right decision more often than not?  Yes.  

On average this season, Sturridge has taken a shot every 25 minutes and score 1 in 4 of those.  By comparison, Suarez takes a shot every 19 minutes and scores roughly 1 in 5.  So, he's not really an overly greedy/selfish shooter or if you want to say he is then that's a bit ridiculous as his conversion rate exceeds that of most everyone in the PL bar Aguero (and even they are very close by a few tenths of a percent).

Sturridge has 7 assists this season.  That's the same as Hazard, Cazorla, Coutinho, and Henderson and more than Nasri, Toure, Lallana, and Mata.  Surely not a bad return for an out and out striker at all.  

Sturridge has had 672 passes in 2,077 minutes played, or 1 pass roughly every 3 minutes.  Aguero passes once every 3.1 minutes, Lukaku once every 3.2 minutes, van Persie every 4.1 minutes.  Dzeko and Girroud both slightly more often at once every 2.7 minutes.  Point being when compared to other strikers, Sturridge passes the ball nearly as often or more often, so he has more than 'moments' where he passes to teammates.

I'm sure you'll say stats don't matter, but for me stats show he's a good player who is no more 'selfish' than any other striker in the PL and in fact a hell of a lot more productive than most in terms of contribution to his team in terms of both goals scored and assists.",0,1398871756,null,0,false,0,ch60sfe,t3_24bki9,t1_ch60sfe,t1_ch5yo6j,null,1433589811,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I agree he makes the occasional wrong decision, everyone does.  How many times has Suarez taken stupid shots from 40 yards out this season that were nowhere near the goal?  Is that selfish?  Coutinho has taken nearly as many shots as Sturridge and a high percentage are off target and he had not nearly the goal return of Sturridge.  Is that selfish?  I'm not saying Sturridge can't or shouldn't improve on certain aspects of his game as you're correct, it would make him better.  My complaint is no one says shit about Coutinho's 'selfishness' or Suarez or even Gerrard taking 9 shots against Chelsea (was that selfish or just poor decision making by Gerrard?) but Danny is constantly getting beat up by everyone and their brother about it.  Second issue being that his primary job is to score goals which he's done admirably not creating chances for others.  No one looks at Dzeko and says he doesn't pass enough or create enough chances for others (1 assist to his name and created roughly half the chances Sturridge has).  I feel people are comparing him to Suarez, which is fair enough, but as much as I love Danny he's nowhere the complete player Suarez is, but then again he's 4 years younger and with time perhaps he'll get to that level.

(The rest of this post is not directed at you, just general points)

People complain about these migrants taking their jobs, but if they're able to come here and out-compete you for a job when they have the disadvantage of being a non-native speaker, then you're probably not as qualified as them. We're not talking about Germany and Scandanavia here where near the entire population speaks English as a second language, we're talking about countries like Bulgaria and Romania where that is simply not the case.

Money does come into it too, but for the majority of jobs, the required skills are more important than saving a few quid. British people need to show they have better skills which justify a higher wage.

Then you have to consider that moving country to get a job shows an incredible amount of drive and determination. These factors are very attractive to employers meaning if they have the same skills as a British worker, the migrant will get the job. Being British doesn't automatically give somebody the right for preferential treatment, you have to demonstrate personality attributes that employers look for, which immigrants have already demonstrated by simply coming here to find work.

I'm currently unemployed, but i'm not under any illusions that migrants are taking the jobs i've interviewed for. Employers try to hire the best candidate for the position and it doesn't matter if that person is from the the North East, East Anglia, East London, Eastern Europe or Eastern Asia.",0,1398873135,null,0,1399126563,0,ch61haq,t3_24cs7p,t1_ch61haq,t1_ch5wq1a,null,1433590137,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Having a Halal option is one thing, but not serving pork meat at *all*? 

&gt; A spokesperson for Subway said the halal-only stores reflect the diversity of Subway customers.

How is that ""diverse""? That strikes me as the exact opposite of diverse. Diversity would mean you cater to *all* groups, not one in particular... unless literally 100% of your customers are Muslims, this is absurd. 

&gt; In a statement, Subway said: “The growing popularity of the Subway chain with the diverse multicultural population across the UK and Ireland means we have to balance the values of many religious communities with the overall aim of improving the health and welfare standards of animals.

It sounds like they're only balancing the values of one specific religious community here. Nobody is forcing Muslims to order pork sandwiches from Subway. They can easily have Halal options and keep pork on the menu. All they'd have to do is avoid any kind of cross-contamination with the meats (which I'm sure they do anyway) and it'd be fine... right?

Bleh. Ah well. If Subway wanna make this change to their stores, another sandwich chain or independent places willing to cater to *all* groups (including Muslims) will spring up to replace them.

...or the subway HQ is giving the franchisees the option of selling only halal meat if they want.  And still offering franchisees the option to run a non-halal subway franchise also.

true,djimonia,lfc99,,"£50m per year sounds reasonable. I caveat this with a few things:

1. I'd prefer not to rename Anfield but the financial realities suggest otherwise - the priority should be wisely investing this summer though, with what money we do have

2. The main thing against a renaming is that it's not a new stadium and Anfield has decades of heritage that people don't want to see ""sold"" - a middle ground is like found in an appended, compatible renaming (e.g. Anfield Standard Chartered) rather than a complete one. BP will not do, for example, as their values may be compatible but their reputation is not. It's tricky but I'm sure the right brand people can come up with something decent together with the commercial people. 

3. If renamed, we can all still call it Anfield for all intents and purposes. Fairly sure the media will indulge the club and sponsor but that shouldn't matter to us. The ""this is Anfield"" sign will neither lose meaning nor value so long as the club retains its values and its newfound reputation for being a football club that plays football and values youth and talent and the Liverpool way on and off the pitch. Our reputation won't be damaged assuming we choose a good sponsor. 

4. If we do sell naming rights, now is the time. The club is on a high, we can get a good deal as a newly (re)minted ""top 3 club"" and lock a sponsor in for a decade to fund the stadium expansion(s). 

5. As an aside, the numbers quoted in the article seem a little as if they're all plucked from thin air. Wages aren't considered nor are existing and new commercial deals. CL revenue and PL earnings are good, and our losses this year were extraordinary (FSG writing off bad debts). We'll be better off next year already before the expansion is even complete.

Portsmouth (night out) and Petersfield (where I was living for vacation work), both a bit more mixed - the officers started out tense and aggressive, but calmed down very quickly when I was obviously just a bit of a weirdo, and apologised for the bad start.

&gt;a three hundred percentage increase in the number of atheists has seen the number of civil ceremonies increase by around 50%

So you're agreeing that you were wrong about atheists usually having Christian weddings, which is what I was correcting you on. It also shows a fair percentage of people who claim to be Christians on the census are having weddings where they can't mention God or Christ, if 65% or so are claiming Christianity, yet over half of people are having secular services, so it's pretty clear a lot of these ""Christians"" are not actual believers.

In this instance education is important. Because not aligning to the left seriously impacts the capacity of a motorway. It's probably not too extreme to suggest that road widening projects may not have had to go ahead if drivers were more willing to keep to the inside.

* What position, formation and team do you think he fits best in? - I honestly have no idea. He's ok at several positions and doesn't excel in any of them. His best position is probably right wing back in a 3-5-2, but we're utter shite when we play that formation.

* What are his main strengths and weaknesses? Strengths are pace and power, good finisher, good at tackling, very direct. Weaknesses are his positioning, passing, crossing and generally he doesn't have a great football brain. Gets noticeably nervous at times which leads to mistakes.

* Overall, was he a good buy? Yes.

* How long do you think he will here be at Villa? Depends who is in charge and which direction we go. Probably a few years. I think in time he'll become a decent premier league player.

* Does he have the ability to play for a club higher up the table? Mid table is his level. I doubt he'll get much beyond that because his basic technique and passing aren't top standard.",0,1398879054,null,0,false,0,ch64egn,t3_24dika,t1_ch64egn,t3_24dika,null,1433591514,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2

So I expect in many of these places people don't even buy anything anyway even if it doesn't have pork or don't come in because the server might have touched bacon probably making it economically sensible to just not have it there for stores where their customers are muslim. They certainly don''t have it where they open stores in muslim countries. 

I probably would have preferred if they had kept pork on the menu but ensured it was separate from the rest of the ingredients so for all intents and purposes the rest of it was halal.

I liked him in the 5-3-2 as a right back. Defensive responsibilities on the wing but still the option to push forward. He is better going forward, but he's not great with possession like a RM should be. I think of Bacuna in the same mold as Rafael. You like his ability up top but he should be back.

Strengths: shooting, pushing the ball into transition.

Weakness: He needs to do a better job of driving opposing offensive players towards the goal line and not allowing them to cut in on him.

Great buy with tons of potential.

He shows some flashes of brilliance, but I think Villa or where Villa (high-mid) should be is a great place for him to hone his skills.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"A 'jury of his peers' isn't some objective standard. There are a multitude of reasons why the state won't give itself a fair trial in its own courts, the most obvious of which is the ideology that grants police officers higher standing than normal people. For example in court of law the statements and witness testimonies of police officers is given greater preference and determined to be **more** honest than those of 'normal people', despite the vast evidence of police lies. This together with the ideology that says police are protecting 'us' makes the assumption obvious that any act is done 'for us'. The CPS also works in favour of the police since most cases never actually makes it to court the CPS being generally unwilling unless pushed to 'find the evidence'. If you actually **look** at how the 'justice' system operates it is objectively one rule for the police one rule for the rest, continuously the CPS has failed to prosecute, in fact in the case of death of [Oluwashijibomi Lapite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Oluwashijibomi_Lapite) an inquest verdict of unlawful killing was found but the CPS, like usual, refused to prosecute, which led to *""an historic decision in the High Court when for the first time in England a Judicial Review required the Crown Prosecution Service to reassess their decision not to prosecute.""* It was this case that abolished the Police Complaints Authority and established the IPCC (i.e. same organisation with a different name), and like usually, **no one was ever put on trial for Lapite's murder**.

Also you obviously don't know how the jury-system in this country works, it's the judge who has ultimate authority, and as a part of the state and usually and elderly white male, they nearly always find in favour of the police. A part from the implicit things like directing the jury and curbing what evidence that is heard and not heard, the judge in several cases of police brutality has intervened to order the jury to make particular decision, for example in the case of the [Death of Christopher Alder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Christopher_Alder): *”A coroner's jury in 2000 returned a verdict that Alder was unlawfully killed and in 2002 five police officers went on trial accused of manslaughter and misconduct in public office,* **but were cleared on the orders of the judge.”**

&gt;also worth pointing out that Birch still faces an IPCC investigation

And what? the IPCC is usually the service that determines whether a criminal proceedings should be initiated against police officers, no other organisation in society allow determined whether its own workmates are guilty or should be tried for crimes as serious as murder. Take [Smiley Culture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiley_Culture), it was the IPCC which determined the officers had no question to answer, and that he had simply stabbed himself to death after police raided his house. In those rare cases when police are found guilty of the murder they commit it's after long struggles and usually overturn, take [Leon Patterson's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Patterson) murder in which after dismissing several juror's the inquest finally reached a verdict of unlawful killing, of course this was overturned on High Court appeal a part from the realities of the case. Like usual the CPS is always deferent to the state and rarely attempts to prosecute police officers. In fact if you look at the previously mentioned Alder case, the IPCC, *following the acquittal...cleared the officers of any wrongdoing*, yet after public pressure and the release of the police video, the government order the IPCC to re-investigate the case, however this time with exactly the same evidence the IPCC said, in March 2006, *the officers present when Alder died were guilty of the ""most serious neglect of duty"" amounting to ""unwitting racism.""* But of course despite this they weren't tried again and were given £60,000 pay offs, not only does this prove the utter flexibility and subservience of the IPCC to the dictates of power, but shows how even in the rare cases it gets pressured to overturn it's previous findings, the officers are left free to go, justice is denied.

are you seriously making appeals to the IPCC, an service that is occupied by ex-police officers and which has continuously found police officers in the clear after the most grievous of crimes, including murder and corruption, and misconduct. The IPCC is a completely degenerate organisation responsible for all the misinformation (that you will no doubt still believe) that was sent to the media after the shooting of Mark Duggan.

As you can see here I've actually produced **evidence**, of which there is tons more. Since 1990 over 1000 people have died after coming into contact with the police, 90% of them black males and not a single police officer has ever been found guilty of anything, most of these cases occurring in the Metropolitan Police force in which one of their own, the [head of the Black Police Association said was **institutionally racist**.](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/apr/21/metropolitan-police-institutionally-racist-black)

This:  

&gt; identities are constructed at some point

Means this: 

&gt;Forming an identity from anyone who decides they want a part of it is just globalism.

is irrelevant. 

One you accept that identities are always changing and are created by complex interactions between society and people - the need to differentiate between that and globalism disappears. It's ALL identity formation. You're forming your identity right now in response to what I'm writing. 

&gt;The end result is that the identity of those that formed the host culture changes and becomes weaker without their permission.

Again you're suffering from confusion, if you accept identity forms and changes in a complex manner - the idea that the process needs ""permission"" from anyone is moot. It doesn't mean anything. Identities form - and that's that. 

What you're trying to do is categorise ""host culture"" as a something other than just another form of identity. 

The problem is that you don't actually believe that identity forms in that way - you believe in a perennial, predetermined identity that exists and cannot change. But the evidence that identities change and form all the time is overwhelming. So now you're struggling to force that logic of a perennial, ancient national identity into a new container when making allowances for change. 

If identity is always in a state of flux, it's not perenial, it's ever changing. Thus even the ""host culture"" that you talk about , is a new identity. It may use symbols of the past and language that claims ""ancient"" heritage but its still just another change in the constant evolution.

First of all, don't misquote. It's poor debating form. I said funds allowing, and I'd imagine funds are an issue regarding wedding venue the vast majority of times. I'm not going to point to some survey, I'm asking if you've ever actually spoken with, you know, people. If you're telling me that most women would not like a lavish church wedding, you have not interacted with many.

I'm also wondering why everyone is staying so quiet on atheists' choice of funeral venue. Of course none of these indicative of, you know, society's defaults.

Go to the subreddit and click the link for the game.

About an hour or two after the match is finished, there are links to full replays of the match.

Be wary, sometimes the websites either have headlines next to the videos showing results.

Also, I'm not sure why, but there's sometimes an image from a shot of the game. Sometimes it shows the score, and because it's separated into two video links, you might see who's winning and who's losing in the respective halves.

What I do is use my palm to block out the top left hand corner of the video before I get a chance to hit play, and avoid looking to the left or right of the websites to avoid spoilers.

true,MontyMole82,,AFC Wimbledon,"Season 6/10 - Despite the 3 point deduction and dropping places taking the shine off things, we've been a huge improvement over last year. The problem of conceding first in almost every game is still there but the defence is pretty good now and for the most part we've made ourselves hard to beat. It's not always been pretty though and the lack of goals (particularly from up front) is an issue that needs to be sorted in pre-season.

As for players, we bought almost a whole squad this year so I'll try and be brief!

Ross Worner 7/10 - Shaky start but grew into his role as the season went on. Pretty good shot-stopper and a big improvement over Seb Brown. Disappointed we didn't sign Sullivan after his loan spell last year but now I wouldn't give up Worner.

Ashley Bayes - Bought in as goalkeeping coach and third choice 'keeper. Haven't seen him play but his energy and shouting when putting Worner through his pre-match warm-ups in front of the Ecohouse make it clear he's a good fit for the team.

Barry Fuller 10/10 - A shoe-in for our player of the year. A proper no nonsense right back who hasn't had a bad game in blue and yellow. Even though he's not really suited to bombing up and down the wing (as he had to during Ardley's 5-3-2 phase), he was tireless.

Callum Kennedy 6/10 - Not a bad left back but poor going forward. Touted as having a great left foot but his delivery has been crap from what I've seen. Been out injured for the last few months.

Andy Frampton 8/10 - Also a little shaky in the early part of the season but soon became a rock at the back. If not for a few goals late in the season from Midson, Frampton could have ended up our top scorer this year! Missed him whenever he was out injured.

Darren Jones 7/10 - Looked solid at the back and meant we haven't missed the injured Bennett quite as much as I'd feared.

Aaron Morris 6/10 - Versatile and showed glimpses he could be a good buy for us. Looks better in midfield than at the back though.

Chris Arthur 6/10 - Along with Sainte-Luce, he's our most exciting attacking player. Mostly appeared as a sub and I, along with many other Dons fans, would like to see him play more. Ridiculously quick but needs to work on his final ball a little bit.

George Francomb 7/10 - After a good loan spell with us last year he was potentially our best signing, but blew hot and cold for the first half of this season. His form really picked up in the last few months though and he's finishing the season as one of our best players.

Jake Nicholson - Has only made a handful of appearances since joining (including *that* game against Cheltenham) so it's too early to tell. Little flashes that he might have been worth the trouble but at other times he seems a bit lightweight.

Charlie Sherringham 4/10 - A real flop. Had a couple of games after returning from injury where he looked like he might have something to offer but has since gone out on loan to non-league. Wouldn't be surprised if he's let go.

We also loaned in so many players over the last couple of years that it's hard to keep straight in my head when we had them. Notably this year though, Michael Smith (up until January when his loan expired) was immense. You could see he came on leaps-and-bounds as a striker during his time with us and, if he'd stayed the whole season, I think we'd have ended up pushing for a play-off spot (and probably would have given Fuller a run for POTY). Gutted we never got the chance to keep him but I'm glad to see him getting amongst the goals at Swindon.

Charlie Wyke worked incredibly hard for the team whenever he played and was unlucky not to score more goals. I was under the impression we'd loaned him for the rest of the season so I was surprised when the deal ran out and he went back.

Kwesi Appiah, currently on loan with us, looks a very handy player. We've been lacking some sort of flair player at the top of the pitch and he's linked up well with Midson and Hylton (who has been more miss than hit). Shame he joined so late that we haven't had as much chance to see him play. Wouldn't mind if we got him back again next year, preferably with a whole season in mind.",0,1398881795,null,0,false,0,ch65qq2,t3_24821u,t1_ch65qq2,t3_24821u,null,1433592213,2,false,LeagueTwo,t5_2wn55,2

&gt;Farah now lives in America. Is he now a British-Somali-American?

So what if he is. Why is it an issue, everyone has multiple identities, why is this wrong in of itself? If he wishes to represent Team GB and spend hours pushing his body to the limits to do that - then we should be proud that our society and our identity has such buy in. I fail to understand why people have to make this a negative thing. It's like arguing that one can only eat the food your mother cooks because she bore you and anything else is treason - it's nonsensical and childish.

&gt;he would have chosen South Africa had he not fallen out with them over their 'quota' system. Let him deny that and then he can pontificate about who should play for what country. 

....but he had the choice to become part of our culture and took it. Again, why is this a problem? It's a sacrifice he thought was worth and he committed to the country he thought would help him become what he wanted. Again , this isn't a bad thing. In fact it's an endorsement of what we have as a society that people want to be part of it. 

What we should worry about is when people stop thinking that and start leaving, both what you would consider British people and everyone else.  Emigration is the sign of a failing society, one that cannot provide for those it is supposed to support and once it becomes chronic whole countries collapse.

&gt;One or the other is fine with me. Either or. 

Yeah, that kind of sums up the reductive logic of people who hold your views. In this case he clearly made the choice to play for a British national squad, we just didn't value his choice - that's a blight on our character not his. 

That's the problem with people who such reductive views, it leads to cases of unfairness. Though the example may not be on the same scale, the malaise that stopped Gurkhas getting their rights, people like Iraqi translators and Afghan translators from being protected, all come from this logic- the endless treatment of citizenship as some genetic legacy rather than a social contract.

Because she was trying to do it the legal way.

PMQ's is fun to watch, and we can see the Prime Minster get called out when he says some complete bullshit. It engages people with the political system, and holds politicians accountable. There's *nothing* politicians would like more than for no one to pay attention to what they're doing. 

PMQ's is one of the better parts of our political system, and I'd much rather have our system than the stuffy American style politics or any of the inbetweens.

Now he's bossing the right side of a diamond or the right side of a middle three, which I don't think anybody would have called 12 months ago.

Also, something we've all noticed this year is the tactical flexibility of this Liverpool team. We've played a number of different formations and IF Lallana (big if, simply because he hasn't had the responsibility at Saints) can change his game to adapt to deeper roles, he'll be perfect.

I found the below a while ago on slashdot and saved it, it might be a few years out of date.

As long as the Muslim population remains around or under 2% in any given country, they will be for the most part be regarded as a peace-loving minority, and not as a threat to other citizens. This is the case in:

United States -- Muslim 0.6%

Australia -- Muslim 1.5%

Canada -- Muslim 1.9%

China -- Muslim 1.8%

Italy -- Muslim 1.5%

Norway -- Muslim 1.8%

At 2% to 5%, they begin to proselytize from other ethnic minorities and disaffected groups, often with major recruiting from the jails and among street gangs.

This is happening in:

Denmark -- Muslim 2%

Germany -- Muslim 3.7%

United Kingdom -- Muslim 2.7%

Spain -- Muslim 4%

Thailand -- Muslim 4.6%

From 5% on, they exercise an inordinate influence in proportion to their percentage of the population. For example, they will push for the introduction of halal (clean by Islamic standards) food, thereby securing food preparation jobs for

Muslims. They will increase pressure on supermarket chains to feature halal on their shelves -- along with threats for failure to comply. This is occurring in:

France -- Muslim 8%

Philippines -- 5%

Sweden -- Muslim 5%

Switzerland -- Muslim 4.3%

The Netherlands -- Muslim 5.5%

Trinidad &amp; Tobago -- Muslim 5.8%

At this point, they will work to get the ruling government to allow them to rule themselves (within their ghettos) under Sharia, the Islamic Law. The ultimate goal of Islamists is to establish Sharia law over the entire world.

When Muslims approach 10% of the population, they tend to increase lawlessness as a means of complaint about their conditions. In Paris , we are already seeing car-burnings. Any non-Muslim action offends Islam, and results in uprisings and threats, such as in Amsterdam , with opposition to Mohammed cartoons and films about Islam. Such tensions are seen daily, particularly in Muslim sections, in:

Guyana -- Muslim 10%

India -- Muslim 13.4%

Israel -- Muslim 16%

Kenya -- Muslim 10%

Russia -- Muslim 15%

After reaching 20%, nations can expect hair-trigger rioting, jihad militia formations, sporadic killings, and the burnings of Christian churches and Jewish synagogues, such as in:

Ethiopia -- Muslim 32.8%

At 40%, nations experience widespread massacres, chronic terror attacks, and ongoing militia warfare, such as in:

Bosnia -- Muslim 40%

Chad -- Muslim 53.1%

Lebanon -- Muslim 59.7%

From 60%, nations experience unfettered persecution of non-believers of all other religions (including non-conforming Muslims), sporadic ethnic cleansing (genocide), use of Sharia Law as a weapon, and ***ya, the tax placed on infidels, such as in:

Albania -- Muslim 70%

Malaysia -- Muslim 60.4%

Qatar -- Muslim 77.5%

Sudan -- Muslim 70%

After 80%, expect daily intimidation and violent jihad, some State-run ethnic cleansing, and even some genocide, as these nations drive out the infidels, and move toward 100% Muslim, such as has been experienced and in some ways is on-going in:

Bangladesh -- Muslim 83%

Egypt -- Muslim 90%

Gaza -- Muslim 98.7%

Indonesia -- Muslim 86.1%

Iran -- Muslim 98%

Iraq -- Muslim 97%

Jordan -- Muslim 92%

Morocco -- Muslim 98.7%

Pakistan -- Muslim 97%

Palestine -- Muslim 99%

Syria -- Muslim 90%

Tajikistan -- Muslim 90%

Turkey -- Muslim 99.8%

United Arab Emirates -- Muslim 96%

100% will usher in the peace of 'Dar-es-Salaam' -- the Islamic House of Peace. Here there's supposed to be peace, because everybody is a Muslim, the Madrasses are the only schools, and the Koran is the only word, such as in:

Afghanistan -- Muslim 100%

Saudi Arabia -- Muslim 100%

Somalia -- Muslim 100%

Yemen -- Muslim 100%",1,1398882811,null,0,false,0,ch668su,t3_24czun,t1_ch668su,t3_24czun,null,1433592449,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

As an indicator of how seriously the government takes this area, the first rocket of ours was launched to space in 1957. The last british made rocket into space launched in 2005 from the Esrange test range in Sweden. They were both the same kind of rocket. The company that made the rockets went bust a long time ago. The company that held the license to produce the Skylark rocket was dissolved in 2012 after having lain dormant for over a decade.

From the article:

&gt;There will also be a simplification of regulations and greater coherence to spur the growth of new space firms.

&gt;The government made the announcements in response to an industry report published last year called Space Innovations and Growth Strategy Action Plan, which was published last year.

The document concerned is the Outer Space Act 1986. Last year it had one of the very few (sub five?) amendments made to it in its lifetime, reducing the needed cover for a space launch organisation from a legal indemnity of £100million to €60 million. So its still the case that you need to be a significant company getting into this field instead of a startup - harding very encouraging, especially when you compared it to the flourishing space launch industry in the states.

Similarly, the last time we had an announcement about a UK spaceport was November, six months ago. The Space field moves incredibly rapidly. Ridiculously so, in fact. If the UK government was serious about this they would have already announced the use of one of at least four ex RAF stations they've recently decided was surplus to requirements, or reactivated the South Uist test range in the Hebrides.",0,1398883175,null,0,1399064354,0,ch66fb5,t3_24dxnn,t1_ch66fb5,t3_24dxnn,null,1433592535,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

There are plenty of time the PM has had his reputation damaged by being unable to answer criticism in PMQs. The leader of the opposition gets an opportunity every week to slam the government on the latest scandal even if Milliband is petty useless at doing so now. It's good that the PM has to face criticism. It won't always be valid and sometimes it's be just soundbites and childishness but for the times when the government is trying to do something quietly or wishes for consensus we need someone there to talk about it and slam the government over it. 

I bet the US president loves the fact that when he wants to pass some law which enables the imprisonment of American's without trial we can do so without showing his face in public once or having to answer a single question. Anytime he does want to say something he can stand in the Whitehouse one a red carpet, in a quiet room with no press or opposition politicians to criticise or bring attention to his bullshit and then when he's done he doesn't have to answer any follow up questions and he just saunters off and leaves opposition politicians to try and get their voice heard on TV or something if they want to be able to hold the President to account.

This buzzline you keep hearing from the media and people who simply regurgitate what they learn on the idiot box is so absurdly simplified;

Everyone potentially thinks they're too good for any job for a certain price. 
Just like selling goods, the employer offers a wage and a potential employee decides weather they will sell their labour for that price.
Cost of living, wages, benefits and social stasis all come in to this.

These 'lazy british people' would work as 'toilet cleaners' if welfare was tinkered and the employers offer better wages/conditions.
When you have kids to raise you will gladly clean toilets if it meant you could give them all the awesome stuff they wanted from healthy food to ipads etc.

What they really mean is 

'british people won't do crap jobs for under a living wage'....(and we like to keep wage inequality high)

Turning to immigrant labour is tackling the symptom and not the cause. ...It's actually adding to the problem because now those jobs are even more difficult for brit's to get and rent and house prices are risen as well (we have a finite amount of land, and houses can only be built so quickly).

&gt;Yes 1 in 10 people I search have something on them, which means 9/10 don't. But those 9 were only held up for a few minutes instead of hours getting taken to custody, booked in then searched in a cell.

To me this seems to be dragnet policing, eerily similar to the tactics employed by GCHQ and the NSA to stop 'terrorism` on UK soil.  

&gt;note we don't arrest for many things there are PND's and street bails to deal with drug use etc. As for the hint at racism, I've never stopped someone based on the colour of their skin.

true,gamas,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"It is true that the minimum wage in the UK would be a fortune to someone hailing from the East, but employers therefore deciding to give them a much lower than UK average wage is simply exploitation. A person's cultural/national background should not be a influencer over how much a person is paid, and there should be penalties imposed on employers not offering the same starting salary to a Polish worker as a British worker. (I was thinking how you could enforce this, I'm thinking by operating 'secret shopper' style operations)

Yes, this wouldn't remove the fact that the Polish worker is probably still going to put more effort into the job, but this is why a) we need a higher average living wage, b) more positive incentives for British workers to take pride in their work and c) more vocational courses so British workers aren't restricted to menial work.

Another thing to consider is that whilst many see people earning money and then taking it back to their home country and see it as Britain losing money to another country.  However, in reality, it is better to see it as an investment.  The Eastern European countries have lower earnings because they are still trying to recover their economy after the whole Soviet mess. That money that goes to those countries - is fed back into their economy therefore fuelling economic growth in those countries. 

In the long term, this is highly beneficial to the UK as not only does this means they have more consumers to buy up our exports, but also the increase in GDP and overall industrial competitive in Eastern European countries will drive up wages in those countries.  In this sense, allowing immigration would reduce immigration in long term.  

The effects of this [has already started taking hold in Poland](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/wave-of-polish-immigration-is-over-says-ambassador--these-days-poles-prefer-to-stay-at-home-9273556.html) - although there is still quite a large influx of Polish immigrants, the stereotype that they simply find low-skills jobs is slowly being diminished with many [actually setting up businesses and engaging in higher-skills jobs](http://www.economist.com/news/britain/21591588-britons-loathe-immigration-principle-quite-immigrants-practice-bulgarians).

So a few weeks ago there was supposedly a meeting with Sherwood where he was told he wouldn't be retained (Incidentally Levy was in the US when this meeting supposedly happened, yes they could have done the meeting over the phone but normally is done face to face), rumor of this meeting hit the press in some manner (some speculation that Sherwood told some friends, including Jamie Redknapp who then leaked the actual information to the news) and Tim had the response of ""you will have to ask my employers about my future""....Spurs release a statement saying there will be a meeting at season end.

This statement, though not a denial of his departure nor a statement of support seems to have calmed Tim down. We started hearing him talk about next season and bitching about players.

Then this story breaks, the club issues a flat out denial (which they NEVER do) despite the fact that both Overmars and FdB said it happened. 

Then Tim makes it sound like he was caught off guard by it all. Surely if the meeting happened a few weeks ago that got him in a huff and the fact he gets asked about different managers at every press conference then he must have had some idea that we are looking at managers to replace him?

First, there's no way the Irish lobby in America will see Adams go to jail over this. It would create a diplomatic problem between the US and UK. Irish-Americans are very powerful in Washington, hence why the USA takes such an active diplomatic interest in NI affairs (Haass, Mitchell, Clinton et al).

Second, he can't remain as Sinn Fein president. It would be too damaging to Sinn Fein's electoral prospects in the 26 counties to have him stay on whilst he is subject to a criminal investigation. Plus he wouldn't be able to ask questions in the Dail without someone responding with a question about being in the IRA. This actually could be one of the most damaging things to SF's electoral prospects across the whole island.

Third, it indicates how the victors not only write history, they prosecute it too. Even in this post-GFA era with buzzwords around 'parity of esteem' etc, no British soldier has yet been held to account, imprisoned, or put on trial for transgressions in Ireland carried out in the course of ""duty"" - and never will. Instead they were promoted, and now live happily retired. The age-old imbalance of power between the dominant force in the conflict (the British state) and Irish republicans is exemplified with this arrest.

Finally - I still can't believe it.

Second half we started off well, had good chances, Courtouis is a beast! But then the definite penalty came, then we were forced to fully attack which meant we were open at the back for the third. The defence in the second half were not good enough. Especially after the second goal Madrid players kept on getting into the box, they had many good opportunities. Our defence was sleeping this game.

Atletico are really good, kept on going at it.

He is also wearing a beret of the King's Regiment, which was amalgamated into the Duke of Lancaster's Regiment in 2006.

As a positive, we're almost there. At the beginning of the season I would have been happy with a semi-final in the CL and that's happened.

As for the game, I think starting Hazard was a mistake. Both the first and third goals came from Juanfran's side, a side he is supposed to cover. I think that this being his first game since injury was the cause of that - he wasn't tracking back like he used to, because that takes discipline and fitness, two things which are lost over injuries.

Our strikers were not invisible per say, but they weren't as imposing as they should be. Costa is a cunt, but every time Atlethico attacked I was looking around for him, and I'm sure the defenders did the same.

I also think Oscar should have played, Ramires and Luiz were both lacking today. Azpilicueta was great on the wing though, and was a nice surprise. He's only 24 years old, and he keeps impressing game after game.

Fine margins. Another day Hazard tracks his man to the back post or Cahill gets a boot on that bobbly cross, and we go into the break 1-0 up. Another day Eto'o doesn't make a needless challenge to give away a penalty, and we still only need the one goal.

Hell, someone [wrote a generator for it](http://www.andybarefoot.com/politics/cameron.php).

One thing to remember is that Reddit tends to be dominated by young adults who have gone into further education - who are statistically more likely to be on the social liberal end of the political scale.  So it is only natural that posts on Reddit are more likely to be ones slamming against parties deemed as being socially conservative.  What doesn't help is that the other parties have made absolutely no effort in the EU election campaign aside from throwing disparaging remarks towards UKIP - which means of course UKIP takes the spotlight, since no-one else is providing material to hate.

I do agree though that the factionalism in politics is awful. Although I massively dislike Nick Clegg for betraying the population by being weak-willed, the one thing I do agree with him on is the idea that there should be more inter-party co-operation within government. 

I was thinking earlier what I would do if I were to become prime minister, and I think I would definitely try to actually extend olive branches to opposition parties.  By this, I mean I would hold an event once a month, where I get the leaders of all represented parties together in a relaxed, cosy environment - perhaps serving tea and biscuits and just having an informal chat about policy (on the lines of ""My government is thinking of proposing such and such a policy, what do you reckon?"", and actually listening to what they have to say and where they disagree be like ""I think you make a good point, but I think it could be addressed by doing this"" or ""I think you make a good point, we will definitely need to keep that in mind"").

•Azpi is the man. Love the passion and solid play for the full match. 

•Iva is solid defensively but not great going forward; I'd love to see another LB come in and let Azpi move to his natural RB. Iva is good cover across the line, however, and always solid. 

•As everyone knows, the striker situation is dire. Why not give Lukaku a chance next season? If not him, then Benzema would be great for us, but Costa was a let-down. Not having seen him before as I don't watch the Spanish league, he didn't show me anything to warrant spending £40m on him. Torres seems to get worse and worse. 

•Can't wait to get Courtois back. That kid is solid as hell. 

•Shame we were missing Matic, he could have helped, but Luiz is solid in MF. I'd like to see him there more permanently next season, unless he's sold.

•Cahill is quickly becoming a really fine player. He's always there when you need him, fights for the cause, and doesn't play games. 

•Not sure what's happened to Oscar, he seems to be completely missing; Jose preferred Dave in MF today? Why has he totally gone off the boil? We need to get him back to his best for next season.

They also pass freely and their center mids can actually play proper football. Ramires seemingly has no clue what to do with the ball at his feet, at least David Luiz can pull off a pass but he can't run it by himself.

&gt; Turning to immigrant labour isn't 'tackling' anything. It's pure simple competition

You must have a reading problem as I already addressed that. 

Also, If you and your established parties are so open to labour competition (for the working class), why don't we give everyone in Bangladesh a British passport. They really like working hard, in horrible conditions in unsafe buildings. An employers wet dream. That would really improve the economy and quality of life. How would british workers compete with people that are used to such harship? Who cares..it's the problem of the working class.

Yeah thanks, we know this part. That's why we are discussing it.

I already addressed this. British people will do these jobs. The labour market will force employers to pay them more for it. If you can't attract low skilled british workers then you don't have a viable business.

Obviously there's an equlibruim to be found, you can't be paying cleaners £20/hr. Some immigration is good but too much isn't. Even Jack Straw recently said that they got it wrong.

&gt;British jobs for British robots

And who builds these robots, and who services them, programmes them, watches over them? Who works in the factories that build the robots. Who works security at the door? We're several generations from to trust a robocop.

The workforce is becoming more educated and automation is happening at the same time. This is a different topic.

On Wednesday 15 December 1993, the Joint Declaration on Peace (more commonly known as the Downing Street Declaration) was issued by John Major, then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, and Albert Reynolds, then Taoiseach (Prime Minister of the Republic of Ireland), on behalf of the British and Irish governments. This included statements that:

* The British government had no ""selfish strategic or economic"" interest in Northern Ireland. This statement would lead, eventually, to the repeal of the Government of Ireland Act 1920.

 

* The British government would uphold the right of the people of Northern Ireland to decide between the Union with Great Britain or a united Ireland.


* The people of the island of Ireland, North and South, had the exclusive right to solve the issues between North and South by mutual consent.


* The Irish government would try to address unionist fears of a united Ireland by amending the Irish Constitution according to the consent principle. This would lead, eventually, to the modification of the Articles 2 and 3.


* A united Ireland could only be brought about by peaceful means.


* Peace must involve a permanent end to the use of, or support for, paramilitary violence.

Lennon was one of our best players last season (your words).  This season he has coped with injury and the same upheaval around managers and tactics as everyone else.  It has been obvious at times that he has been asked to play differently than usual and he is also being hampered by our lack of width on the opposing flank and not playing with a regular, decent right-back due to Walker's injury.  Suddenly, he's the worst player, his poor form is irreversible and he should be sent straight to the knackers? - whereas others with no pedigree of playing well in the Premiership at all are still viewed by many as great hopes for next season.

Now, I'm not saying there aren't reasons for selling Lennon (his injury record is one good reason, IMO, and even if he does return to form then I don't see him improving any further than his peak from last season) but one bad season is sometimes just that: one bad season.

Soldado does touches and flicks that noone else can - he is clearly a class player. Lamela has more goals and assists than lennon this season and paulinho has had many good games for us. Lennon on the other hand has been absolutely shit - not just  bad - shit. Rewatch our matches, its absolutely incredible how he is so, so fucking bad. He does absolutely nothing.

Lennon has had less injuries than usual this season. Blaming tactics shows that you have no clue as sherwoods tactics suit him absolutely perfectly. (4-4-2, picking the ball from deep with two strikers to aim for). Arguing that he is hampered by width on the other side is simply laughable. Townsend didnt need another winger to be able to do this thing called getting the ball and not either giving it away or passing it straight back inside like that joke of a player lennon does.

&gt; one bad season

Not a bad season - a horrendous season. He has been without any doubt in my mind the worst staring player in the premier league this season. It is the first bad season of what will be many many more. he is undergoing an irreversible decline IMO and the sooner we find some club stupid enough to take him off of us the better.

true,OfficePlum,lfc50,,"After the PFA awards Luis Suarez did an interview over the phone to a Uruguayan TV show called Hola Vecinos. He was walking around with his wife Sofia, daughter Delfi and son Benjamin [Suarez calls him ""el gordo"" (""the chubby one"")]

Suarez: “After the Chelsea game we had to rush to London, to get the the PFA event. I was upset about the game still”

Interviewer (Rafa Cotelo) “Your wife looked beautiful Luis. The gals here at the studio want to know what designer was she wearing and you?”

Suarez: “I don’t know, we are not like that, we don’t care about designers that’s how we are. Yes, my wife looked beautiful”

(The mobile phone reception wasn’t very good for a while and interviewer told Suarez) “Maybe you can afford a better plan? or phone next time?”

Suarez: “ha ha ha, we are in a shopping centre, sorry the reception is not so good. I’m shy and I had to go up and do a little speech. I’m more comfortable when people ask me questions, my English is very bad. I knew the people I had to thank and had to mention but I made it short because of my English” [After his speech at the ceremony, Suarez went back to his table to kiss his wife, shake his team-mates hands and hug Brendan Rodgers]

Interviewer: “Luis your English sounds better now, you have to stop talking to your wife and kids and talk more with other people”

Suarez: “Ha ha ha…. well I am trying! I’m very honoured and proud to receive the PFA award, especially because my mates in football voted for me. It is very special”

(Presumably Suarez was then asked about the photo he was in with Philippe Coutinho)

Suarez: “The picture with Coutinho [and the banana] was because I didn’t like what happened, so we had to do something with Phil”

Interviewer: “Forget the bananas Luis. The emblem of SALTO [where Suarez was born] is the orange, man! You have to take a photo with an orange to promote your land”

Suarez: “Ha ha ha, yeah that would be great, but I felt I had to do something for my Brazilian team-mates, my friends”

Interviewer: “So how do you feel about the game Sunday [against Chelsea]?”

Suarez: “I’m still upset, it was so frustrating, we couldn’t find spaces and we made a mistake and it was hard to deal with. We knew the game was going to be hard and tight but it was frustrating when they were using up time. I was upset because of our mistake; we all got nervous and lost control. It was impossible to find spaces to get in”

Interviewer: “Now that you know English better did u say anything to them in English?”

Suarez: “No no, I was upset and talking in Spanish because they were using up time and I was upset about that. They (Chelsea) were using up the time since the start of the game. We are hoping Man City loses some points, but in the Premier League you never know, anything is possible. Now we have to win the next two games and it is not going to be easy”

Interviewer: “On behalf of all the Uruguayan people we would like to ask you to please be careful, we want you in one piece in June, man. If you see somebody coming towards you too hard, please take your leg away. We promise you nobody is going to think you are a coward”

Suarez: “Yes..yes that is always in the back of my head. I know, I know but the next games are very important. I have to keep everybody happy. I have a duty to my club and I am trying my best”

Interviewer: “We have seen photos of your Delfi with Lucas Leiva’s kid”

Suarez: “I know what photo you are talking about but that is an old photo from last year. Both are celebrating”

Interviewer: “There was also another photo of Delfi celebrating a goal and you were in full kit. We are worried that besides the fact that you can’t afford a decent phone plan, you can’t afford clothes..?! and your kid was wearing Nacional kit”

At this moment Suarez is laughing very loud

Suarez: “Delfi loves football and every time she goes to see Liverpool, she goes nuts. I said to Delfi ‘it’s so nice outside, would you like to come out and play?” but Delfi said ‘Wait daddy I have to change’.
She comes back in full Nacional kit [Suarez’s club in Uruguay], haha and she does that to make my Sofia (her mum) upset because Sofi is a Penarol fan. Delfi then says, ‘I changed so you have to change too’. So I had to go up and change to full kit as well! Delfi scores a goal and you can see in the picture she is really into it ha ha ha”

Interviewer: “So …how are you doing with your goal scoring and spending ten minutes celebrating kissing your hand?”

Suarez: “I had to think about where I was going to put Benjamin’s name because my celebration was going to get out of control haha”

Interviewer: “Yeah it is rare to see a family man in football and also a person that is a rock star as well…you know…celebrating like that”

Suarez: “Ha ha ha ha… I am still learning several trades…”

Interviewer: “After the world cup in Brazil, if we want another interview, where should we call? England or Spain? Just think that if you move to Spain, you don’t have to learn another language!”

Suarez: “Ha ha ha…I’m very happy here and my family is happy here and don’t worry nothing is going to happen to me. If we could win the Premier League and bring the trophy home it would be incredible, a dream come true…
One time , I was told, do you know what it means for your kids to say, ‘daddy we are champions!’ That really got to me. It got to me because it hurt, that somebody would think that Uruguay is never going to be champion again. I have kept that phrase in my heart and I want to show the world, on the pitch, that we are good. I am going to work hard, to do my best to bring happiness to my people”.

Interviewer: “I don’t want to take any more of your time and keep you away from your family. Thanks Luis!”

Suarez: “But I still have two or three pounds left on my phone!”

true,popidge,meepo,Meepo,"Fair cop. I'm on the caster wagon myself, but I have a background in radio, here's a bit of friendly info;

Broadcast media, of any variety, is a very ""get out there and do it to get noticed"" thing. You have to be the one doing things yourself - you can't rely on bootstrapping youself off established casters. You can do that a little, but even that will be hard if you don't get yourself out there a little on your own. 

Looking at casting dota 2 (and esports) specifically, you have to be aware of how your abilites work too. Most 2-person cast teams have a play-by-play caller (think LD, Ayesee, Zyori, Sheever, Tobiwan) and a Color commentator (Merlini, Lumi, Synderen any pro they get in to co-cast).
The play-by-play is astute at calling the action as it happens, painting a picture of the current happenings smoothly. They're often better with their words, able to report the plays as they happen without stumbling over words, and keeping the broadcast flowing. 

The color commentator is there to fill the gaps, delve deep into plays, offer a more ""expert insight"" into what's going on. They'll usually be former pros who might not be as comfortable on the mic themselves, but are comfortable enough and know shit-tons about the game.

Now, there is the idea that you can have multiple play-by-play guys, but that requires a lot of effort and comfort with your team to work - or you'll end up overtalking each other, or unfairly dividing the labor, or having a cast that doesn't offer a ton of substance. This is where solo casts tend to fall short - there's little back-and-forth and hole in one persons skillset aren't plugged by the others. That's not to say solo casting is bad, its just why a 2-person team can be greater than the sum of it's respective parts.

If you're looking to co-cast, you're probably looking at filling the ""Color commentator"" slot - anyone who is casting on their own will likely be more comfortable play-by-play. Ask yourself - are you comfortable in that role? Does your knowledge of the game extend far enough to do that properly? Can you delve deep into the minds of the players you're casting, and explain their thoughts and decisions to the listener? Can you analyse a play you've just seen and break it down bit-by bit in retrospect when there's a quiet spell 20 seconds later? Can you avoid talking at the same time as your casting partner? Do you have competitive dota expereince to back up what you say (this is important - people look to this as your credibility - nobody wants to be told how one lane setup is better than another by someone who knows less of the game than them)

Now, let's have a look at the play-by-play skillset. Are you comfortable taking the lead on the mic? Can you talk? Can you describe action as it happens without stumbling on words? can you keep the cast lively, keep the listener engaged? 

Now, if your dota knowledge vastly eclipses all other skills (protip - if you've not been playing competitively for a while, it probably doesn't), then go the route you're currently on. Tell people like me or bainshee who currently solo play-by-play that you know a shitload about this game and can talk relatively comfortably on the mic. We'll probably bring you along for a game or two, to see how you fit with our cast style, and if your knowledge really is that superior (cause if it's not, I'm unlikely to cast often with you - it may sound control-freaky but I'm a firm believer in jettisoning deadweight)

But, if your skillset does not lie there, try play-by-play - I honestly think this applies to 90%+ of new casters. There is no better way to develop, grow, and show your willingness to cast and be an active part of the esports community than getting out there and talking over games yourself. You may be shit at first, but confidence grows. How do you get started? Simple. Find any team matchmaking game. Heck, find any live dota game in client. find a replay. Find a game that you want to cast. Start up a recording or streaming program, and record or stream your casting. Cast it like you've heard others do so. Add your own flair if you want. Upload it somewhere. Get people to watch. Take their criticism on board. If they say ""worst caster ever"", brush it off and say ""okay, I'll be better next time"". 

Keep doing that. Get a feel for what's going on the scene you're casting in. Check out the joinDota league lower divisions for games to cast - most UK teams I've met are super happy for a caster to come cast it, they'll even tell their friends to watch! Most important is to keep working at it. Every single big name dota 2 caster I know of has done this - they've casted hundreds of games, on their lonesome, sometimes they've bought a friend in, to watcher figures in the single/double digits. They've worked hard to get where they are, and you will too.

**TL;DR**: Don't bother being a ""co-caster"" unless you're a massive dota brainbox. Just pick up a game, any game, and cast it -live or recorded. Keep doing that. Get friends who know more about the game in to ""guest co-cast"". Do more. Keep working. Cast more. Keep casting. Be self-motivated. Buzzword. Don't steal games I want to cast. Challenge bainshee to a hillfight. Learn who Danny D is. Buy Pyrion Flax a cider. Cast more. Do it yourself. Work hard.",0,1398895157,null,0,1398895405,0,ch6cel8,t3_24e44f,t1_ch6cel8,t1_ch6anyh,null,1433595353,3,false,UKDota,t5_2uyoj,3

 Large scale immigration  has helped resolve some issues that without it, would be crippling. The high density of OAPs in the country has led to the middle aged not being able to support them. The immigrants have been able to decrease the ratio of OAPs to the working population, leaving the aging population problem less of a problem. 

 The main issue iwith immigration and being able to enter this country as freely as it currently is, is that it can be easily exploited. The money the jobs pay can be spent in other economy (sent back to a family back home), thus making the jobs they work essentially paying money into an external economy. If there were regulations in place to stop this, essentially forcing the money they earn to spent inside the UK, it would create a more sustainable immigration policy.",0,1398895730,null,0,false,0,ch6co56,t3_2445l9,t1_ch6co56,t1_ch3nrur,null,1433595478,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,Pointlessillism,cnty-uk,filthy immigrant,"Things are very different in the SE where plenty of young families are looking at commutes of 1 hour+ in to London just to buy a very average house. That's if they can save for a deposit while paying London rents.

I do take your point about personal responsibility. But the fact is that so much of what's wrong with the housing market is systemic. Prices are completely out of pace with wages. There isn't enough supply. Tax breaks encourage middle-aged morons to get into buy to let, an industry they are completely hopeless at (don't get me started on the fucking property porn TV show bullshit that encourages these idiots). London is becoming a city for only the very rich and very poor. All other industries suffer when so much of peoples' income has to go on housing - it's a complete *waste*, they could be buying so much more! Then you've the social mobility issue where getting the deposit together is often predicated on having wealthy parents who can help you out. I could go on and on.

It's not that learning to buckle down and save is a bad thing. And maybe lots of people do have wildly unrealistic expectations. But it's a problem when parts of London, for example, which would have been filled with ordinary middle class middle income people, become out of reach to anybody not earning a City wage. It hurts everyone - and the government has SO MUCH scope to do more to ameliorate the situation, and they're just not. In fact in many ways they're actively making it worse.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Having spent the last 9 years renting, In my experience the issue lies in the implementation rather than the legal framework... but it is at the same time undermined by the fact the legal framework is a patchwork of laws, many of which actually hark back to a time when tenants were illiterate working class scum who didn't matter in the eyes of the law - and landlords were wealthy land owners who did. 

It's very hard to make anything happen quickly, which benefits landlords enormously. Because they can secure section 21 eviction orders for non payment of rent faster than their tenants can force the landlord to make repairs to a property even if it endangers their life. It's actually pretty amazing. 

I actually think regulation is the way forward as the article proposes;

* Make it the law that anyone renting **must** be a registered landlord, the cost of which is born by the landlord at a rate of perhaps £50 per property per year. That is enough that it could run the scheme, but is small enough that it could be passed on to tenants in raised costs if needed.

* Next, make it a criminal offense to rent any property in the UK without being a registered landlord. 

* Then give the Landlords regulator body the power to ""strike off"" landlords for poor practice - e.g. not return of deposits, relevant criminal convictions etc. It would make landlords think twice about the actual human beings they are housing. 

Finally, and perhaps controversially - the fact landlords have been able to make stable returns of 10-20% despite the recession actually makes me think that as a market, if prices aren't going down, they should at the very least probably be paying more tax! There aren't many investments where you can get those kind of returns.

true,LordMondando,null,null,"&gt;Having spent the last 9 years renting, In my experience the issue lies in the implementation rather than the legal framework... but it is at the same time undermined by the fact the legal framework is a patchwork of laws, many of which actually hark back to a time when tenants were illiterate working class scum who didn't matter in the eyes of the law - and landlords were wealthy land owners who did.

Well that takes a funny view of how common law works. There's laws on the books banning Christmas, doesn't mean they have any chance of flying with relevant precedence in court. Recent acts on the other hand.

&gt;It's very hard to make anything happen quickly, which benefits landlords enormously. Because they can secure section 21 eviction orders for non payment of rent faster than their tenants can force the landlord to make repairs to a property even if it endangers their life. It's actually pretty amazing.

Here I agree, but I think that's largely due to public ignorance of the law. 

&gt;Make it the law that anyone renting must be a registered landlord, the cost of which is born by the landlord at a rate of perhaps £50 per property per year. That is enough that it could run the scheme, but is small enough that it could be passed on to tenants in raised costs if needed.

Do agree with the registered bit. Should look into the law more, but generally speaking I think you have to go fairly dodgy for tha not to be the case. 

&gt;Next, make it a criminal offense to rent any property in the UK without being a registered landlord.

Maybe. Important legislative distinction between Criminal and civil though, pretty sure the latter would be enough given you can make it easily financially unviable that way. 

&gt;Then give the Landlords regulator body the power to ""strike off"" landlords for poor practice - e.g. not return of deposits, relevant criminal convictions etc. It would make landlords think twice about the actual human beings they are housing.

Another inefficent quango... It's werid you have faith in thouse. If the CAB and Police can't sort it out, it tends not to get sorted in my experience. 

&gt;Oh, and a flat out ban on any sort of ""agency"", ""deposit protection"" etc. fee. Everything has to be included in a single monthly or weekly cost.

true,mrandocalrissian,king,,"Regarding injury, Lennon was injured in the opening game and didn't even return to training until 11 league games had been played.  For a player who is so reliant on his physical attributes, it is a big thing to miss the first third of the season.

Secondly, despite what some people may learn from playing Football Manager, ""tactics"" are more complex than just what formation is used.  Sherwood *himself* has mentioned how he has tried to get Lennon involved a bit more centrally in some games, which IMO doesn't play to his strengths.  In the games where we have played 4-4-2 (which hasn't been solely used throughout Sherwood's tenure anyway), the lack of opposing width, general lack of incision elsewhere because the rest of the team has largely sucked, and ineffective overlapping support from his full-back have limited Lennon's effective opportunities.  Granted, he has usually not delivered well when given the chance anyway but it is harder for a player out of form to rediscover form when his effective opportunities are limited.

On the others, I would say that Paulinho has had one really good game; Lamela's ""goal and assists"" (note: one goal, the same as Lennon this season) were against the likes of Sheriff and Tromso in the Europa league; and, IMO, Soldado's place in the team should be merited on his actual goalscoring contributions, not just his ability to ""do flicks"".  ...but for some reason they are still coming off bad seasons as great hopes for next year, whilst Lennon is suddenly worse than cancer.  I find this exaggeratedly negative towards him and can only assume that he is being scapegoated for the rest of the team being piss poor.  Personally, I don't believe one season makes a bad player and, just like I'm willing to give the aforementioned trio a chance next year, having settled in more, I have faith that Lennon will return to form.

**DISCLAIMER**- I am a leftie physics student who has tried to use cold hard facts, but I'm countering emotive statements that may be true, but are missing the full truth. I've also had a shitter of a day at work and may have cut some corners. I've been as thorough as I can without falling asleep/committing suicide at the sight of Nigel Farage's face. I appreciate people may disagree.

Ok, the beacon to questionable candidates, I think only merits a google at the recent and growing list of councillors who have said something racist, xenophobic, sexist or homophobic. If you want me to list them, I will, but right now I can't be arsed.

As for the EU and policy things, let's look at the stuff they say in their [Party Political Broadcast (PPB as I call it)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aARKlOOypaQ):

&gt;Last two generations robbed of a vote on the EU

Ok, I'll be the first to admit that I'm not sure about this statement- I'm not old enough to be aware of previous policies (and there's only so far I'm going to google). However, we've had the opportunity to decide our representation in the European parliament, and UKIP are in fact weakening our position in there, by simply voting ""No"" on everything.
&gt;[The EU] has greater impact on our everyday lives than anything that takes place [in Westminster].

Genuinely don't know where they got this from. Emotive statement, based on little to do with reality. My daily life is rather more controlled by local government and Westminster, even more so by large corporations, given my propensity to buy food from such places.

The bit about him claiming that Britain has little to do with its own destiny is a little ignorant seeing as we've managed to get out of the single currency and Schengen zone and remain in control of our own financial market.

I'm not sure about immigration predictions (other than the previous Romanian invasion being a tad off the mark).

&gt;More EU immigration than ever before

Yup, they are right about that. [From this article:](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/feb/27/net-migration-uk-jumps-30-percent)

&gt;The figures show that 532,000 people migrated to Britain in the year ending last September. The figure includes 60,000 more EU migrants and 25,000 migrants from the rest of the world compared with a year previously. More than 218,000 were students.

&gt;A total of 320,000 emigrants left Britain last year, 23,000 fewer than the previous year and the lowest level since 2008, when the number peaked at 427,000.

Hmm, so we lost 320 000, gained 532 000 (of which almost half were temporary residents in the form of students), a net gain of 212 000. I dislike arguing about immigration, particularly as it's largely an emotive issue. [Research shows that immigration has an overall positive effect](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24813467), but I understand that the issue of different cultures, and the perception of job theft and benefit tourism (ugh) doesn't help.

&gt;900 000 jobs advertised in the UK for EU citizens.

That's not the government's fault (much as I'd like to blame them), it's companies advertising, it's companies setting wages, it's companies employing the migrants. Yes, the EU allows greater freedom of movement, but I hardly think that's the issue (in my opinion, anyway).

&gt;European judges are baaaaaad

The EHRC is a contentious issue, but they interfere very little with the application of UK law. [This sums it up better than I ever could](http://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2013/03/03/what-would-happen-if-the-uk-withdrew-from-the-european-court-of-human-rights/), but it essentially says that we already make our own rulings in human rights cases (and it's all properly referenced).

&gt;Green taxes have added £200 to the average fuel bill

Hmm, actually, [this *is* true](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/energy/renewableenergy/8564995/Green-taxes-make-up-20-per-cent-of-household-energy-bills-campaigners-warn.html) but it has fuck all to do with Europe, it's OUR government that's taxing us. [This article sums up pricing etc. quite well](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24238708), [and so does this one](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-25743336).

&gt;9000 fishing jobs lost

[Yes, this is again true](http://www.dw.de/overfishing-is-a-problem-across-the-eu/a-17181163), but really this is to stop environmental catastrophe, and damage to our seas. According to [this wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_industry#Problems_in_Europe), many millions of pounds and hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost as a result, but this isn't the EU's fault, this is them cleaning up the mess of the fishing industry. I'm sure there are jobs that have flourished since we joined the EU.

&gt;If we leave the EU, we'll be able to do our own thing wrt trade

Erm, I'm sure we would, but we'd be ignoring the [CBI](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/03/britain-eu-business-lobby-group-cbi), [a Euro-sceptic group](http://www.openeurope.org.uk/Content/Documents/Pdfs/2012EUTrade.pdf) and [Oxford Economics (on behalf of the Business for New Europe)](http://www.bnegroup.org/images/uploads/publications/files/An_Indispensable_Relationship_-_Full_Report.pdf). Even David Cameron has warned against it, with the examples UKIP uses (Switzerland and Norway) having to abide by EU trade laws **but get no say in them**, surely, if we're to trade with the EU as an *growing* entity, we'd benefit from being able to have a British say in how trade in Europe works.

&gt;WAAAAAH SMALL BUSINESSES

This is insinuating that EU laws are restricting small businesses. Note [this article](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/apr/29/uk-gdp-growth-2014-what-the-economists-say), which says not only is the British economy doing well, but the chairman of the Federation for Small Businesses, John Allen, stating that ""four out of five jobs in the past three years have been created by small businesses"", saying there is confidence in the continued growth of small businesses. That statement by the chap in the PPB was just fucking emotive bullshit that had no substance.
***
As a bonus, I came across this too:
&gt;75% of all laws come from the EU

This has been proven false in multiple sources even when they mentioned it before the last general election, [here's Channel 4's debunking of that (admittedly complex myth)](http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/is-most-of-the-uks-law-made-in-brussels/1498).

Then the co-caster is usually the factor that changes more often and they bring some type of specific knowledge to the table. This might be previous competitive experience (Merlini for example) or knowledge of the local scene and trends there (Winter was really good for this). But generally the co-caster is an additional that plays a completely different role to the main player.

If anything, you should be looking to try and invite a more experienced player to co-cast with you who knows the local scene, the players, the trends etc. and you can kind of, off-handedly interview them during the downtime in the game.

I used to work with a guy who had been a ""contractor"" full time for the same company for 25 years.

But there is also a genuine contract market, and HMRC refuse to accept that. So the only way around it is for contractors to work for a company, get paid a salary (with NI being paid) and have the company hire them out for an hourly rate.

You can do that yourself, with your own company, but it is expensive and complicated, and you won't have the expertise to be tax efficient. So the idea of an umbrella company is that they do all that for lots of different people, and it works out better for everybody.

Landlords would be both encouraged and enforced through legislation backed regulation to have more of a duty of care to tenants - an acknowledgement of the fact they provide one of the single most important aspects of a persons life - their home. It would help drive out some of the low cost high margin BTL scum from the market - and replace them with 'professional' landlords that are more service driven (ie a bit like a publican or a hotelier... Fair about costs and focused on providing good services). 

In return though, tenants would have greater expectation to return properties intact, and landlords would also get new powers to get money back (beyond the balance of the damages deposit) where properties have been recklessly damaged. 

In time the gov could then even legislate to make it illegal to hold any more than 2 weeks worth of rent in damages deposit.

In regards to your question at the end, we're probably stocked up on attacking midfielder talent. We have a lot of players who might need one or two seasons to grow, most noticeable Salah, but raw talent wise, we're in a pretty good spot. Once Salah has improved him final touch a bit, he should fit right into the rotation, which would give us five great players to rotate. This is actually true for most of our squad. We have players with immense raw talent at almost every position; Lukaku as a striker, van Ginkel in central midfield, Kalas and Zouma in defense. Aside from our striker issues, our squad actually seems to be in a really great spot, especially if van Ginkel fully recovers from his injury, as he could really turn out to be a key player next season.

So a jury says he did nothing wrong but the media has decided that he has? Presumably because it doesn't look pretty.  Good job the media doesn't make our laws really. 

He's been arrested because he was drunk and disorderly and had assaulted a police officer. This means that the officer's assessment of him is as being a high risk. People who are drunk tend not to feel pain very well so pain compliance techniques often aren't as effective as they otherwise would be, TASER does not rely on pain to work, that makes a it a good choice. He then assaults him by throwing the underpants in his face. The officer does not know if there is some hidden weapon in the pants, he might be trying to hide something else.

Sunday, the Cuban, from 6pm

Monday, Hoppin Mad Swing Dancing, 7:30pm elmgrove center in Cotham

Tuesday/Wednesday, Salsa souls, 8pm, slug and lettuce on corn street (although next 3 weeks it's moved to Pranjays(sp) opposite on corn street).

There are also swing classes on Tuesday in Easton and Wednesday in Southville, check swingdancebristol for details

There is also a Flamenco class on Fridays which is very small at bristol dance center (near brandon hill?), not for me (tried it once though) but could be your thing.

There are often one-off classes on weekends, especially for swing, plus one or two salsa parties from salsa souls per month on a Friday night.

If you have a partner you can also try a ballroom dance course, I did one with britannia dance which was fun (that was on a tuesday).

Anyway, dancing is fun, which is why I do it 4 times a week minimum. It requires no skill to begin with, 2 left feet are fine, I have friends that do it who have such incredibly poor co-ordination and they were reluctant, but once they tried it they were hooked!

Strikers are an eternal discussion in this sub, but I'd like to see Lukaku come back next year, have Ba as a sub/cup striker, and bring in one more experienced-but-not-aging striker to score goals and tutor Lukaku.  Also if Eto'o wants to hang around another year I wouldn't mind.
