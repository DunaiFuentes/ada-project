Deep down I know it's not going to happen, and probably couldn't happen anyway.

In my mind the tories ripped off the country to provide tax breaks to prop their own government up, and a fair few of them lined their own pockets. Labour took it to a new level though. However in all fairness it was something that seemed to start in the 80s and continue regardless of the change of government.",0,1394933936,null,0,false,0,cg3mujz,t3_20i70f,t1_cg3mujz,t1_cg3jopc,null,1435546833,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

true,mispelledyouth,null,null,"It's very difficult leaving school and having an empty CV but the thing you need to focus on is that *everything* is decided in the interview and the CV is just a way of getting you to that point. So, to that end, a 'Key Skills' section right at the top might be beneficial. The person reading your CV will probably spend 5 - 30 seconds on it so you need to make sure you're worth the full time by putting all the good stuff right at the top.

How would you describe the skills that you've picked up so far?

If you've studied English Language then I presume you have **Excellent literacy**, and you may also have picked up **Strong written and verbal communication skills**, what with writing essays and the like.

I'm going to recommend you lie about that D in maths and make it a C.  They won't check, promise, and having a C means that you have **Confident Numerical ability** covered.

ICT translates to **Strong computer skills** which as a natural consequence has ensured that your are a **Natural problem solver**  with a **strong analytical capacity** ( remove the separate coursework grade though, it's confusing )

I'm presuming that you also have great **Interpersonal Skills** developed from your time during your DoE, yes?  I have no idea what Sustainability Skills so can't suggest anything from that but try and think of something you can draw from that.

These are just suggestions, but having a list of 'why you should hire me' skills at the top will give you a strong advantage.  I recommend a 2 column table with no border shading and try and keep the points to an even number.

What's most important though is that for each *key skill* you write you can think of a real world example of when you have demonstrated that skill, then you'll be golden!

Good Luck!!

Edit::Maybe don't use the word 'skills' as much as I have, looking at my own CV I may have overdone it a little.

Some are better than others, of course, but there is a definite theme amongst them. Build as many square-shaped houses as possible, as close together as possible.

Many of these detached houses are only about a few feet apart, and their walls (even the exterior) are so thin that neighbours can hear *everything* from the outside. So much for a detached house.

This was after the tories came into power and the contact the DWP had with A4e was up in the air. The JCP decided to push as many people to A4e as they could, to the point where there was almost no standing room in the main room. That was not fun. We had air-con machines running at full blast during the coldest most snowy days of December.


For people who didn't get put on placements, it was basically a combination of a punishment and a tool to force you to not be working off the books. You had to be there 35 hours a week, ostensibly to be looking for work. But the only resources there were 2 telephones, a handful of local newspapers and enough computers for about 40% of the people. 

I genuinely got some good experience out of it. It was my first experience of real world feeling work. Getting up at 6am for a 90 to 120 minute bus trip. Dealing with people.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  Feminism is about equality, not female superiority

Calling bullshit, furthermore that's the reason it is a destructive ideology.

I don't need to say more. But, as a male, I LOVE working single mums, who I work with. I think they're absolutely brilliant and when pushing for a better life for themself, with a child, I admire nothing more than them absolutely smashing the job in a much better way than any single male does. 

As a man, I say that. But, as a man I know that in my position and positions I have been, if a high stressful, highly confrontational environment with 'tensional' levels of debate arise, a lot of women don't push forward in a way in which naturally occurs, due to lack of testosterone and thus, a 'competitive mindframe'. So, when I see feminists pushing for 'greater equality', in regard to the workplace, because the amount of men in power is greater than the amount of women, I find this natural. I find it natural to feel as though I should lift a womans pram onto the bus and say 'you need a hand love', while bending down and using one hand whereas she'd struggle. I like to hold a door open for a woman when entering a restaurant, and feel as though holding a chair out so they can sit down when in the restaurant is a gentlemanly way to behave, as a man. 

Feminists don't like any of that, which is why I find it as destructive. Companies promote on pure ability and possibly, ruthlessness. Women shouldn't be given promotion in the work place if they naturally as on a chemistry level lack the qualities of leadership, and I am not saying that to provoke you, although I understand it will. 

I feel men and women are different on many levels, disregard all laws that 'class them as such', I don't support that. I support 'naturality', a woman should have the same opportunities as a man. Likewise, so should a single dad as much as a single mum. If however, companies and businesses promote more men, due to as I say natural chemistry, and more single mum get more benefits due to the same fact that they feel stronger feelings toward children.. as is prevalent throughout our species, we shouldn't try to enforce more single dads via law either. 

So yeah, feminism, being about the female, and females rights, as they encroach on 'naturality' is as bad as a stupid 'male rights' group, which does the same. 

I don't like ideology, the ideology islam and the ideology of feminism are destructive ideologies, as is ANY ideology that ignores 'common sense', and tries to enforce ideological ideas that don't work in real life.

Basically, you should be hired as an adviser. Because to be fair, sanctions should be implemented only when they really are needed, like if somebody really is taking the piss. We do need more humans who get people into work via building rapport, finding what it is they can/should/need to do, and then saying 'so why can't you do this'.

I was unlucky enough to be claiming JSA on and off for 5 years. Been in full time work for the past 16 months, thanks to a lot of help I received in the last couple years I was unemployed.

The job centre I had to visit sounds as friendly as yours. Hardly any trouble and most people working there were friendly and helpful.

I missed the introduction of UJ but helped my Dad with it when he begrudgingly had to sign on. It seemed pretty counter-intuitive and always had stability issues, always crashing or freezing up. 

The staff never made me feel like a scrounger, probably because I tried my best to apply for everything I could. My Dad on the other hand would always be accused of not trying hard enough, partly due to UJ. 

I worked part time in a few charity shops and had a months work placement at Tesco (didn't get a job out of that either).  I didn't like signing on but I would have ended up on the streets or couch surfing if I hadn't. I'd rather eat boring food and sleep in my own warm bed then that.

The frustrating thing is having to sit through games where there is such a lack of passion from the players, it feels like they've given up at times. BUT... I think AVB had a point about the atmosphere at The Lane, which could be having an effect on the players (maybe it's a vicious circle of players not playing well, fans getting frustrated, atmosphere dying so players heads drop, don't play well etc etc). Anyway, on Thursday night when we scored that goal and The Lane erupted, for the following few minutes the place was buzzing. I hadn't heard that noise in so long, not at all this season. It used to be like that for the majority of a match and the players responded, now it's not and so they don't. 

I'm not doing an AVB and blaming us fans entirely, I think the players have a lot to answer for with some of their attitudes at times and I also think Mr Levy has a lot to do with all this (but that's for another time), but we need to stay positive and believe that we can get through this dark spot. We can win matches like the NLD today, we've got the team for it and the supporters for it, we just all need to believe and be a bit more positive about it all.

The Royal Navy immediately established a presence off Africa to enforce the ban, called the West Africa Squadron.

So the general advice (disclaimer: this isn't proper financial advice ;) ) is you are unlikely to do reliably well investing in single companies, the better approach is to invest in massive groups of companies in particular sectors. These are generally called ""index funds"" or the very similar ""exchange traded funds"". You invest in, say, all of the top 500 companies in the US (in for example this: http://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/v/vanguard-funds-plc-s-and-p-500-etf-usdgbp ) rather than one or two. With index funds like this: http://www.hl.co.uk/funds/fund-discounts,-prices--and--factsheets/search-results/v/vanguard-ftse-uk-equity-index-accumulation you don't pay trading fees, there's a management fee (which is percentage based, great if you've not got significant sums to invest). This is much safer than investing in individual companies.

*However* PF stuff would go a bit further and make sure you're on a sound footing to begin with, and understand what it is you want out of this. Any investments should be seen as long term, with the expectation you're not going to want access to this money for 10 years. You should also expect to see the investments halve in value at some point *and not pull out*.

true,Falc7,null,null,"Sure. If I as a worker produce £10 of value to my firm, and I am, as the original comment said being paid less than this value, so lets say £7. Then I produce £3 of profit for my firm. If these numbers were constant, so the value of an extra worker is always £10, and the cost is always £7, the firm would keep hiring more workers until unemployment in the country got to 0. Why? because for every worker they hired they would get an extra £3 profit. Therefore firms will keep hiring as long as the wage level is below the value added by that worker.


However in reality these numbers are not constant, and economists don't model them as being constant. The first worker may add £10, then second won't be quite as productive (if you are curious I can explain why as well but to keep this short I won't explain here) so he adds maybe £9.50 in value. Therefore firms will keep hiring until the extra value to the firm added by the last employee equals the cost of that employee.

Because firms want to maximise profits they will act as follows:

If value added by workers &gt; wage ===&gt; hire more

If value added by workers&lt; wage ===&gt; fire workers

One thing, you use benefit *fraud* statistics as a proxy for benefit free-riding (a common misconception on r/uk): no sensible observer claims benefit *fraud* is endemic, but that doesn't mean there aren't far more people trying to *free-ride* the benefits system by avoiding work.

You could use an analogy here: benefit *fraud* is deliberate illegal misstatement, the moral equivalent of tax *evasion* (rare).

true,Falc7,null,null,"I mis-wrote one of the &lt; signs, corrected it now.

I only didn't include demand for apples my original example to keep things simple, the result is the same either way.

Think of it like this, in an commercial orchard, the first worker picks £20 worth of apples an hour, the second picks £19, the third £18 and so on. 

The wages level for apple pickers is £15. How many workers will the firm hire? It will hire 5. Because if it were to hire 6 workers, it would have to pay them £15, but they would only make £14 for the company, therefore by hiring them the company loses £1.

Why wouldn't they hire 4? Because that worker would pick £16 worth of apples, but only cost £15, therefore the firm can make a profit by hiring more workers.

Now to get to your question, what happens when demand for apples isn't infinite? NOTHING! Because no where have I assumed that the demand for apples is infinite. I'll explain, if the demand for apples falls, then the quantity demanded and the price of apples falls (intersection of demand and supply curves), therefore even if each workers picks the same amount of apples, the value of the crop isn't as much.

So maybe it looks like this:
The first worker now picks £19 worth of apples an hour, the second £18, ect.

If we for now assume the apple pickers wages are constant (I can model them changing if required but it makes things much more complicated and won't add anything to the dicussion). So apple pickers wages are £15, now the firm only hires 4 people. Again, value the worker adds = cost of wages. So no matter what happens firms will hire up to the point where wages = value added.

I know this theory isn't perfect. Firms do make profits, but it shows how the relationship dynamic between value added and wages must behave, because if it didn't, then firms wouldn't be profit maximising (which we are assuming they are).

I may be behaving condescendingly, because I quite frankly get annoyed, you hear so many people talking with such confidence about things that they know jack shit about. And posts like mine, that are economically literate get down voted because it isn't what people want to hear. People don't care about understanding, they care about being right.

In terms of quality of staff I would say that my Job centre had a similar issue with not seeing claimants as people but I should add that even after a few days experience I could tell that some of these people were never going to get a job. Whether this be down to mental issues, hygiene issues, or something else, it was easy to see that the only thing advisers were doing was ""going easy on them"" in terms of allowing them to go on without really putting in much effort.

This I admired. Nobody believes that these people will get a job, so why take away their money if they don't believe it themselves? It's obvious that more should be done to help these people though, I don't think DWP has the facilities or the funds to provide help but I'd like to see more being done to support these kinds of people.

In regard to the customers' response to me, their whole attitude usually changed when I mentioned that I was in the same position. Usually there'd be some sympathy for me doing this unpaid work and then we'd both complain about UJM or something else that's frustrating about jobseeking.


During the work experience I dedicated 15 minutes a day to (semi-seriously) lobbying for them to take me on in a paid role. ""It's a shame you aren't here tomorrow because have to deal with a lot more."" ""Well I wouldn't need to sign-on if you hired me."" and after a while I began to think that this was similar to an apprenticeship: cheap labour, and when you can get it cheap like this then what's the sense in paying?

I'm no economist, but in principle, if it could work, I would be in favour of some type of Universal Basic Income.

Of course, this value differs as different places have different costs of living, especially for places such as London and Scotland.


[The average annual earnings of full-time workers in the UK is £26,500 before tax, in the year to April 2012.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-20442666) However, the median income is likely to be much lower. Median as in 50% of people earn less than that, 50% earn more. Averages skew the results.

I was probably unfair by lumping them in with the can't-be-bothered types.  I did deal with a lot of customers who fit your description, and the advisors know who they are.  In most cases they're happy enough to go through the motions and just give out the money, since both parties are aware that almost anything else would be futile.  I'm sure the advisors would be happy to give any assistance they can, but as I mentioned in a few places, they simply aren't given the time or resources.  The Jobcentre I worked in had **5-minute** signing appointments - a constant complaint in morning meetings - and I personally haven't seen an advisor for one of those longer appointments since the middle of last year.

I saw several people who had no GCSEs or similar and had been sent to me to compile a CV.  In reality we both know we're fighting an uphill battle, but I did what I could to help.  More often than not it was possible to demonstrate some mathematical or English ability from another source, and that's all many employers are looking for at GCSE level, I think.  This is especially true for older people who've been in work a while; GCSEs are essentially meaningless.  However, coming out of school without them now is a major disadvantage, and I suppose that's the reason for all the 16-24 schemes.

As you said, people who've reached mid-twenties or later with nothing are essentially beyond my ability to help.  They should be given some kind of assistance, but that assistance is theoretically beyond the remit of JSA.

I don't fault people with major hurdles, either.  I saw a lot of people with mental health issues and learning difficulties which made almost any work essentially unattainable, and in those cases again we just went through the motions to ensure they could get their money.",0,1394970055,null,0,1394970868,0,cg3vv89,t3_20hx9d,t1_cg3vv89,t1_cg3tvr9,null,1435551093,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt; If there was, then wages for the same job would be the same all over the world. 

Why?

&gt;Lower wages, same output

Only in the short term, why do you think wages are rising in China low skilled factory workers and falling in the low skilled UK sector? Because they are being equalised.

&gt;To say there is some magic formula that dictates how much someone gets paid is once more, to be living totally in the theoretical realm.

Actually you are wrong, the determinants of wage are:
education, experience, age, industry + others
Given this information, wages can be predicted fairly accurately.

For the sake of such an august reputation, I suspect he would have avoided limiting his sample to areas of excessive deprivation.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Curtice

And Curtice's results were echoed by ICM's September 2013.

It is accepted that in the world of opinion polls a sample size of a thousand has an inherent 3% margin of error.  

In this case, I think the margin of error is likely to be greater because even some Scottish people realise that venality is a failing that need not be admitted to.

The likely truth is that more than 62% of Scots would vote for independence for £500 and that's a true Scottish Nationalist and England, Wales and Northern Ireland are best rid of such gurning ballast.

[There's a whole document about Land Transfers for academies on the government website.](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/254887/land_transfer_advice_april_2013.pdf) 

Here's a very relevant section:

&gt;If the academy wishes the academy trust to have the freehold interest in the land on 
conversion, the Secretary of State will use his powers under Schedule 1 of the 
Academies Act 2010 to direct that the **land currently used for the purposes of the school 
(and held by the governing body) is transferred from the existing governing body directly 
to the academy trust.** 

&gt;In these cases: 

&gt;* the land should be transferred further to a direction from the Secretary of State. Whilst it is possible for the land to be transferred by private arrangement between the governing body, the academy trust, and the local authority, a direction will normally be issued in order to avoid the possibility of the land automatically 
reverting to a local authority against the wishes of the academy trust should there 
be a problem in finalising any private arrangement; and 
&gt;* **the Funding Agreement MUST contain:**
&gt;* **the model clauses protecting the public land from disposal (e.g. by being leased or mortgaged) without the Secretary of State’s consent;** 
&gt;* the model clauses requiring a restriction to be registered with the Land 
Registry to reflect these provisions; and 
&gt;* the model clauses requiring the academy trust to apply for notice to be 
entered in the Land Register to protect the Secretary of State’s option to 
acquire the land for nil consideration. The Funding Agreement will also 
oblige the academy trust to insure the land and buildings and maintain 
them in at least as good a condition as when they were transferred.

So when the Secretary of State has used this power, the land is now held by the academy trust (even sponsored schools still have a trust), and can't be disposed of without the Secretary of State's consent.

A FoI request on when this permission has been given should turn up whether any companies have got their hands on school sites. I doubt that this has happened.

No paper ran, for example, that 1hr video of snipers shooting protestors in its full form. 

On Twitter, people can tweet links to newspaper articles, but the much more interesting use of it I find is where something happens, and people at the scene can tweet what's going on directly. It's like, a few months ago, the bridge I travel over on the way home was closed for no clear reason. Type the bridge's name into Twitter, and instantly I can see that people have posted accounts of what's going on, and photos of the scene from flats that overlook the bridge. The evening news can't compete with that, although it probably recapped all the tweets in a report on the incident a couple of days after the fact.

Recently there was a soccer match that I wanted to watch, but that was not broadcast on my basic cable television. Investigating around the internet for a site that would stream the live game, I stumbled upon a few well designed websites . If you go there, you will see a nice listing of today’s fixtures with the time the match starts, the players, past results for each team, and the logos for each team as well as the league or tournament the game belongs to. It looks very professional. On each match page, there is a video player. When you click play, you are presented with this message to install missing plugin.

if you're searching for ""Manchester United vs Liverpool FC live"" for example there are so many scam results on first few pages.

I have friends and family who work for JCP and let me assure you that they are fighting a daily battle against customers who treat them like shit.

It's a service that is there to help you to look for work, NOT to give you a job, and yet people think they have free reign to take pot shots at the staff. You come wandering in to the JC woth your own personal problems and want to bitch and moan and be made to feel special? Well, guess what? You're the 12th person that day to sit in that seat and unload your issues.

Basically, have a bit more respect you imbecile. JCP staff are underpaid for the daily crap they have to endure and maybe some people do harden up over time but 99% of them will help you if you walk in there with no preconceived ideology of how horrible they are. 

While I'm on a rant, let me just say that you are the very worst type of JobSeeker. Thinking you're 'bright' enough to be in work and currently studying yet not actually being employed? Fucking lazyness. My friend lost her job three weeks ago so went out and handed a CV in at every possible place she could think of in the local deprived ex-mining community and now has 3 interviews lined up.

Yeah, that's the emotional tack the papers have been picking up on a lot. it's not even officially called the **Bedroom Tax**, that's a name made up by the media. Still, even though it is more emotionally charged than it needs to, people still know what it means. I also agree with the principle that people should move to houses with the correct amount of rooms, although the method the government has taken, as well as failing to provide a substantial number of properties for this to actually happen, leaves a lot to be desired.

&gt; It's a service that is there to help you to look for work

Is it?  I can't think of anything (before this placement) that the Jobcentre has done that has helped me look for work.  I already have most of the skills they would generally help me develop, and I'm over 24, so I'm ineligible for a lot of the help they could provide.  They keep me alive by giving me enough money to eat, but they do very little to actively help me find work.  Whether that's what Jobcentres *should* be is another question.

&gt; let me just say that you are the very worst type of JobSeeker. Thinking you're 'bright' enough to be in work and currently studying yet not actually being employed? Fucking lazyness.

I am demonstrably and unarguably capable of fulfilling the requirements of a wide variety of jobs - as are millions of others - since I've worked in a variety and have been successful in all of them.  But there is a lot of competition and many jobs are totally out of bounds if you don't happen to give a good interview.  It's a skill I lack and I'm working on it.  I'm studying part-time because, well, I need a hobby to keep me sane, basically.  I'm sorry that trying to pass some time and improve myself into the bargain is so offensive to you.

Anyway, the provision of help shouldn't depend on how nice a job seeker happens to be.  Look up the word 'professionalism.'  If the execution of your duties changes because you don't like someone, you're doing a bad job.  It might be understandable, but it isn't good.",0,1394980326,null,0,1394980732,0,cg3y0zj,t3_20hx9d,t1_cg3y0zj,t1_cg3wvyv,null,1435552111,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

They still get the same payments for tv licence they always had, they also still provide the same sort of service. They use money saving as an excuse but notice how non of the executives on 100k+ a year arnt taking pay cuts.
The real reason is that advertising revenue makes more money than what the bbc makes, meaning they can afford better shows ect. With this in mind the bbc cant compete anymore, which is why in my eyes it think its ridiculous we still pay tv licence fee. 
If you only watch tv on demand, say 4od or 5on demand, why should we have to pay the bbc for that privilege. Over the internet the bbc provide no service what so ever if your not watching the bbc, but they still expect their money.

 [**Operation Algeciras**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation%20Algeciras): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;__Operation Algeciras__ was a foiled Argentine plan to sabotage a [Royal Navy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy) [warship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship) in [Gibraltar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar) during the [Falklands War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands_War). The Argentine assumption was that if the [British military](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_military) felt vulnerable in Europe, they would decide to keep some vessels in European waters rather than send them to the [Falklands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falklands).

&gt;A commando team observed British naval traffic in the area from Spain during 1982, waiting to attack a target of opportunity when ordered, using [frogmen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogman) and Italian [limpet mines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limpet_mine).

&gt;The plan was to launch divers from [Algeciras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeciras), have them swim across the bay, to Gibraltar, under cover of darkness, attach the mines to a British naval ship and swim back to Algeciras. The timed detonators would cause the mines to explode after the divers had time to safely swim back across the bay. The plan was foiled when the Spanish police became suspicious of their behaviour and arrested them before any attack could be mounted.

I don't really get the attraction people have to the coal industry. Job's a job and all that, but, given the choice, would you want to work deep underground in an unsafe, unhealthy, dark, and claustrophic environment, doing work that knocks a couple of decades off your life expectancy for shit wages? Doubt it.


Ultimately, whatever role Thatcher played in the demise of the coal industry was for the best. The only real failing was that there was never any investment in bringing new factories to the areas where the mines used to be.

So the key point is what they actually mean by a garden city- if it's no different from the developments which have been happening for the last decade, this announcement is fairly meaningless. Personally, I hope to see a high density development, based around easy access by bike and foot to Ebbsfleet station (17 mins to St Pancras), with lots of green space, and good links into the surrounding countryside. The area should be like a leafy inner London village, with well-planned parks, good local amenities, and town-house and apartment development, and not just suburban sprawl - identical estates full of tiny detached houses, with tiny gardens, accessible only by car. After all, this area has better public transport links to central London than a lot of inner London.

Here's the area of the development (Eastern Quarry is the grey area covered with Qs):

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Universities used to be free and you got given a grant, now you have to pay to go there and borrow money to live on. This didn't happen overnight.

University isn't free and never has been. Now individuals pay through loans borrowed against the capital and income taxes of private workers- who may or may not have kids who go to university themselves. Some of that money gets paid back to those individuals when students earn enough, through the redistribution of taxes, a lot of it does not. 

Again, job centre plus services are paid for by the tax contributions of private individuals. The reason they want people to pay for challenges- sorry to dwell on the original point but I feel I must, is that it costs the taxpayer exponentially more to have lengthy proceedings in court. 

Individuals pay for legal challenges through taxes, for people who are claiming money that was generated from those very same taxes.

Canada also gets a ridiculous bargain from the monarchy. Our governor-general, who stands in for the Queen, gets paid a measly Can$270,602 (163,000 pounds), and in return does the usual royal stuff, including and especially, trips abroad to chat up the Canadian brand. Granted, there are other costs, such as for staff and upkeep of the official residence, but those are things that would happen anyway, even under a republican system. As for costs of supporting the Queen herself, I'm not aware that Canada pays *anything*, except during official royal visits, which always draw the crowds and can be considered money well-spent. Frankly, we (brits and canucks alike) are eating the Royals' lunch; they're just too well-bred to complain.

* dare united to stretch themselves by playing out wide, and they didn't early, and once they did, we just killed them

true,cathlicjoo,null,null,"Wow so much to say about this game.  First of all you have to hand it to Allen and Hendo, the amount of pressure they put on each and every minute was remarkable.  They had the same amount of energy they had in the last minute as they did in the first!  I think the moment where Rooney had the ball at the top of the box and got picked from behind by Henderson about sums that up.  So glad to see he put a shot on target as well, albeit straight to DeGea haha  Same thing with Sterling too, all over the pitch and putting on so much pressure with his pace.  

I thought Flano played well, maybe a bit over zealous but it was overshadowed by United pretty much as a whole playing the same way.  I was nervous when I saw he got his yellow so early in the game and was extremely happy to see him hold his composure a bit and not draw a red in such a big game.  The one time shot that Rooney put on Migs was a result of him pressing a bit too much and leaving his man down the wing, obviously would like to not see that happen but fortunately Migs got the save.  Him vs Januzaj was a fun matchup to watch, I think he got beaten a few times but nothing too devastating. 

Johnson played very well, I felt very confident about our defense on the right side of the field.  Looked pretty good in their third too.  Back four as a whole played well, but I did spot a few times where Agger made a jump on a ball in the air well before the ball got there and left it to United to get.  Persie's missed header in particular.  He had time to move in front of him but made the jump a tad too early.

Suarez and Sturridge looked good as always, it was pretty obvious United's backline didn't know how to handle them and were scared, making very poor challenges.  Danny did make a meal out of Vidic's challenge, not in too good of taste but it is against United and he knew he could draw it.  I felt they could've linked up better this game though, more than a few times I felt both were a little bit too selfish with the ball.

And of course the captain did great when called to the spot, unfortunate he missed his third but it's bound to happen whenever you notch a ball so tightly against the post.  Felt like he continued to do great in his holding role and am interested to see what happens now that Lucas has come back.

Coutinho did well coming in later in the game, probably for the best that he was the sub instead of Sterling, I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of that in the future.  Very happy to see his shot from the edge of the box almost hit the target, he's been a bit more accurate with his last few strikes and hopefully that trend continues.  Mostly I'm just glad to see we're at full health again and even have the option to make a sub like that.

Mata was taken out of the game, RVP was near absent, Rooney and Januzaj were about all they had going for them, thought DeGea played well though all things considered.  Not many keepers are going to be able to stop Suarez from that range.  It goes without saying that this game was critical for us, a statement match for this year's title race and races to come.  We absolutely controlled that game from start to finish.

Britain's royal family is the most expensive in Europe at more than double the cost of the Dutch monarchy.** Taxpayers are kept in the dark about the exact cost of the monarchy, due to the royal household's exemption from the Freedom of Information Act and widespread misunderstanding about the nature of the royal family's finances.

The estimated total annual cost of the monarchy to taxpayers is £202.4m, around five times the official figure published by the royal household. The official figure excludes a number of costs, including round-the-clock security, lavish royal visits and lost revenue from the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall. Civil List expenditure has increased by 94 per cent in real terms over the last two decades. £202.4m is **equivalent to 9,560 nurses, 8,200 police officers** and more than the total annual Ministry of Defence spending on food. The total cost is also equivalent to a number of high profile government cuts, including cuts to the Sure Start programme.

Those challenges that they are now trying to charge people for, they are on the whole mistakes by the JC+ system. That's why the majority of challenges are successful. If the proposals to charge people were purely about money then they are going about it the wrong way: rather than save money by forcing the minority of claimants who were fairly sanctioned to pay for their challenge, why not improve the decision making system so those vulnerable people on benefits aren't sanctioned to begin with.

Normally an Academy can only sell land it actually owns. The majority of Academies hold their land in a 125 year lease from the local authority. 

This is an interesting case because the land is being sold by the Local Authority just prior to conversion, and is being used to fund construction of a substantial asset being handed over to academy chain ARK.

It's also interesting because Gove has overruled his own school playing fields advisory panel which opposed the sale.

This still seems open to corruption: substantial assets have been leased at no cost to opaque academy chains with strong connections to Government ministers. 

I haven't enough information to decide whether Gove is a blunderer or corrupt. His stated overall vision of improving education seems beyond criticism, but his implementation has been so obviously unworkable that I'm not sure it can be put down to incompetence.

true,TheMysteriousShadow,lfc68,,"Beautiful win. As I said in the match thread, this was easily our greatest performance this season as a team; we shut them down defensively, bossed their midfield and attacked with real passion. In the end, given the amount of penalties and chances in the last 10 minutes, it could easily have been 5 or 6, which has been an underlying trait for us recently. 

A couple of thoughts:

- Flanagan was incredible; he really controlled Januzaj, got down the wings well and looked solid on the ball. 

- Sterling provided some excellent passes, but was slightly off in a different position. The Coutinho change really helped.  

- Gerrard is magnificent. He's our talisman, our heart, our leader, and our inspiration. I hope he stays on for another two or three seasons, and we repay him with a title win that he so desperately deserves.

- ANOTHER clean-sheet! Suddenly, we seemed to have really tightened up at the back and cut out most major mistakes. It's incredible.

- This *has* to be the best Liverpool squad for many, many seasons. They all play for each other, all seem linked in their desires and understanding. 

- Sturridge diving was disgusting. I love him, but he's much too good to resort to such stupid, horrible tactics.

A currency union with an independent Scotland would mean immediate testing from the markets (remember George Soros, he's now retired but there are many that would just love to emulate him), it would mean rUK effectively underwriting an independent Scotland and acting as a lender of last resort to a Scottish financial sector that would be operating under a different oversight and enforcement regime (also remember the Scottish financial sector has HBOS and RBS which aren't very good bets at the moment), it would give an independent Scotland input into the economic policies of rUK when Salmond has declared outright that Scotland would be a competitor.

We need a bit more imagination going forward.Townsend was really good today, he was our biggest threat, its good to have him back. Eriksen was a bit quiet but still good in my view. I really liked Bentaleb and Sandro in the middle, they were solid defensively and in my view won the battle in the middle. Most important, the heads didn't go down, we played and pushed until the last minute.

I would have hours of deep panic and sheer conviction that I was going absolutely insane. I felt outside of my body and that reality itself was dissolving. It was absolutely maddening.

My consumption was irregular but consistent. Every other day I would drink *something*. It wasn't unusual to polish off 4 pints of Guinness in an evening, maybe twice a week, then go out on the weekend.

I went cold turkey and my anxiety mostly cleared up after about two weeks. After three, my depression and mood swings mostly went away. The world seemed ""brighter"" again, consistently. It was a change I did not expect because I'd become accustomed to just ""being that way"". All along it was the alcohol triggering the ups and downs.

I also lost some weight.

(｡♥‿♥｡) ChipFest 10: Kawaii Edition (｡♥‿♥｡)


Friday 4th April 2014

Maguire's Pizza Bar, Renshaw St, Liverpool


(´･ω･`)

It's been 10 whole shows for the UK's finest chiptune night! And to celebrate, we've got a stonker of a line-up!

Kawaii isn't just ""cute"", it's a state of mind. And these acts take Kawaii to the next level, mixing hyper-sugary melodies and harmonies with, quite frankly, ridiculously filthy bass 'n' beats. It's going to be a night to remember, so get yourself down to it!

(づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ


(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

(✿◕‿◕) chibi-tech (JP) (◕‿◕✿)

All the way from Japan, chibi-tech is set to land in the UK for only one of three European shows - so this is an absolute must see for any fans of glorious NES melodies mixed with surprisingly filthy bass!
""hi! i'm jaelyn, a.k.a. chibi-tech. i love making music &amp; sounds. i mostly do it professionally as a composer for the videogame industry. sometimes i do it as a hobby. always i do it for joy.""

(✿◠‿◠) Mizkai (◠‿◠✿)

Mizkai begun life as a petri-dish of sugar solution in a secret laboratory nestled somewhere in the quaint British countryside. Created from a complex compound recovered from the furthest reaches of space, she was destined to one day awaken and brainwash the populace with cute hypnotic lo-fi soundscapes.

Tired of the sound of overly polished modern music production, She dusted off her GameBoys to create lo-fi sounds reminiscent of a childhood sugar induced coma crossed with a 90's rave.

(✿◡‿◡) Kero Kero Bonito (◡‿◡✿)

Gus and Jamie met bilingual Japanese-English MC Sarah after posting an advert for a rapper on MixB, a bulletin board for Japanese expats in London. As Kero Kero Bonito, they make micro hip hop about crocodiles and parties. They released their debut mixtape, ‘Intro Bonito’, in September 2013. Live, Sarah wears her own handmade kawaii costumes while Jamie and Gus incite the dance with Casio keyboards and Yamaha drum machines.

Who'd have thought the sound of 2014 would be 90's influenced N64 dance pop electro? Kero Kero Bonito obviously do! This is your chance to see 'em before magazines think they're on trend by announcing them as ""newly discovered!""

Having supported Spurs since I was 6, so nearing 20 years, we were always a very average side when I was growing up. In recent years we've pushed from a top 10 team to knocking on the door of CL football every year.

I'm cautiously optimistic that next year the players we brought in will be settled and with maybe a few changes (in and out) we can really give every team a tough test. I hope the performance today is an indicator of that.

Also I do like Tim, because he has a lot of passion, but I honestly think we need a more experienced manager. Would love to see Tim coaching again though.

You've won the right to be window dressing and cannon-fodder when you get promoted to the Premier League.  If you escape relegation, great, you're still going to be cannon-fodder and window dressing the next year.  

Hand me a list of who spends the most in the EPL and I can tell you who is going to the Champions League before a single ball is ever kicked. 

If I hand you a list of who spends the most in MLS, well it doesn't mean all that much.   RSL, Portland, and Sporting Kansas City have established themselves as top tier clubs despite spending a lot less than clubs like NYRB, Seattle or LA Galaxy. 

I think pro/rel meant more when there wasn't so much money in soccer. Nowadays, it's worthless unless the guy that's bought your club is one of the top 20 richest people on Earth.  I think the true irony and tragedy is that European soccer could benefit so much from a salary cap.  Then, promotion and relegation could have meaning again.   

As it is now, promotion/relegation seems to act more as a mechanism to make sure the rich stay filthy rich and the poor stay filthy poor.   ",0,1394995109,null,0,1394995712,0,cg43sw1,t3_1xm6ms,t1_cg43sw1,t1_cfcoohw,null,1435554842,1,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,1

I've met quite a few postgrads living on campus who are out even more than undergrads, although the students union has been criticised for not doing enough for just postgrads (nobody really gives a toss about the union anyway). Living on campus is very expensive (probably true for most universities) but it will be easy to get to your department/the library and especially sorting out the bureaucratic stuff with council tax exemption, bills etc coming from outside the UK. There's loads of things to do in York to keep you happy and the centre is really nice.

QM will have everything you could want at your disposal having such easy access to London but will come with a big price.

However it's a nice campus and it has the added benefit of coming under the university of London so will share resources with other universities.

Price control is similar, but with the added problem that you have to make sure the owner doesn't just sell it on at market rates for a huge profit. You also need to be sure it goes to someone who is eligible for social housing. If the government are telling you who you can sell to, and for how much, you don't really own the house.

Then there is a fairness argument. There will be people who have worked hard for years, climbing the housing ladder, paying off the mortgage - they can just about afford to buy a house closer to London. 

These are ordinary-ish people - well paid, but not outrageously so. They are not evil. Why push them aside and give the housing to people who maybe haven't put the years in to deserve it.

In fact, building lots of houses in areas closer to London would actually make houses a bit cheaper slightly elsewhere which would make housing more affordable without messing around with the market.

**Private companies set for access to patient data for just £1** (9 August 2013)

http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/your-practice/practice-topics/it/private-companies-set-for-access-to-patient-data-for-just-1/20003879.article

&gt; Private companies and researchers will be able to access data from GP records for £1, under plans revealed by NHS England to radically reduce the cost and boost the availability of information about patients available outside the NHS.

&gt; The body’s chief data officer has revealed he wants to reduce the costs for companies to access NHS datasets, from around £20,000 to £30,000 currently, to just £1.

&gt; NHS England said the data would be used to identify where improvements and efficiencies could be made in the NHS and that only approved companies would have access to the data.

&gt; But the GPC (General Practioners Committee) has raised concerns that private companies would have access to NHS patient data ‘on the cheap’.

(...)

&gt; [The chief data officer at NHS England] added: ‘NHS England wishes to reduce the fees to 1 GBP in order to encourage a wider range of accredited organisations, including charitable organisations, to analyse the data. However, we are keeping the nominal fee in place in order to ensure that all such organisations are held accountable for how they use the data, by means of a legally enforceable contract.

&gt; ‘Such requests will be approved on an individual basis and will still be subject to the highest standards of information governance and all applicable privacy legislation.’

&gt; Dr Paul Cundy, chair of the GPC’s ICT subcommittee said he had concerns over the plans. He said: ‘Bona fide research would seem to be OK, but I would have some concerns about private companies getting NHS patient’s data on the cheap.’

&gt; Dr Brian Fisher, NHS Alliance patient and public involvement lead and a GP in Lewisham echoed these concerns.

&gt; He said: ‘There needs to be a fair price for data that’s extremely valuable. When the data is extracted from GP records, its put together with other data sources in a way which means patients can be identified.

&gt; ‘Private companies will be particularly adept at this and they will get a lot out of it. So there needs to be a fair price for this data.’

For years NHS has refused to adopt technologies, or have paid millions researching solutions around data protection only to constantly give up and enforce it to the point that even researchers hired by the NHS have been seriously hampered. (For example, no patient information is  allowed to be sent via an Email or any similar protocols. Instead the information has to be passed on via the telephone (with the patients consent), which makes life a nightmare for NHS researchers trying to find volunteers or people who meet their criteria.


So whilst I think their data protection policy is ridiculous, I still find it appallingly contradictory, and possibly even illegal that they've done this.

That largely depends on how long you're intending to stay.  Short-term rental is almost always cheaper, pretty much everywhere I look the going rental price is 25% less than a mortgage would cost on a similar property - and that's counting on a 30% deposit.

Indeed there was an article in the press a couple of weeks ago that worked out if you bought/rented in year x; then sold-up/left in year x + i; taking into account capital gains/rent increases/interest rates/etc. whether renting was cheaper than buying for different values of 'i'.  The cross-over point, where buying was the better option was a surprisingly high value of 'i' (depending on your location), something like 15 years was the average.

In other words, if you want a family home you intend to live in forever - buy something.  If you don't know where your life/career/etc. is going to take you - don't buy something.  Not at current prices anyway.

Your second and third points are largely emotional but irrelevant.  Do you choose between Tesco and Sainsbury's based on which one makes the most money?  If something is a good deal for you, it's a good deal for you, whether the other party is making a pittance or millions is not my concern.

I also mentiuoned a two-fold benefit to the NHS selling data: short term cash boost and improved patient treatment. Reducing the cost of data decreases income but improves patient treatment. 

I won't be removing my sentence about people saying this is a betrayal of trust are wrong, because it's true. Selling data to drug companies is not a bad thing.  

Say they get a set of data of ten thousand people taking their drug. They find out there is on average an increase in heart attacks of people aged 70+. They can then recommend the NHS not to prescribe their drug to this age group so they don't get sued for killing people. 

This kind of data can only be gained from post-approval research on people being given the drug. It's far more long term and can easily be missed in pre-approval trials.

United, on the other hand, have had their squad's quality move in exactly the opposite direction. Today the gaps were just laid bare: their £40m man had to come off for a 35-year old CB to stop SAS running rampant.

Compare that to our defence, Touré is comparable but he's 4th choice, and I'd say CB is the weakest part of our squad after GK. (And before anyone defends Migs, I mean squad not first XI). And while I'm rambling on, I'd like to see us sign an older striker who can provide decent cover for Sturridge and Suarez if one or both is out of the game.

true,c0mpassion,null,null,"Alcohol doesn't actually ""take the edge off"". All it does is disconnects you from your senses, and research has shown that over a long enough period of time, drinking alcohol in response to stress can actually make less able to cope with stress, thus making you feel *more* stressed overall.

By drinking alcohol you don't actually relieve the original stress, you just become temporarily less aware of it.

Regular drinking also means that your body will gradually build a tolerance to the drug, which means you will need increasingly large amounts to achieve the same level of inebriation. This is one aspect of the drug that makes it so addictive. And that's another thing to keep in mind. Alcohol is an addictive drug, just like nicotine, or heroin. Would you play with fire by ""taking the edge off"" with a cigarette every night? If we saw somebody doing this, we'd all feel they were headed in a dangerous direction.

Stress is a warning sign from the body that something needs to be changed. By drinking, all you are doing is disconnecting yourself from that warning — essentially avoiding dealing with it. This can obviously have a detrimental effect on your overall happiness as you can become stuck with a life that you're not actually happy with.

I think Sterling did well in parts today, even though he doesn't seem like a natural no.10 he always gets his head up and uses the ball well. It seems tailor made for Coutinho though.

Citation on that explicit and direct correlation?

To quote the HSCIC in article linked:

&gt; The Health &amp; Social Care Information Centre, the government body responsible for the database, admits there is a possibility that patients could be identified, despite strict safeguards. A spokesman said: “There remains a small risk of re-identification if data is put together with other data sources.”

# ` `

Next in line is...

&gt; Honestly I don't see why people have a problem with a drug company knowing somebody in a certain postcode has a particular illness. They're not going to go out and try and locate them,...

How do you know this?

There are no safeguards in the UK on this.

There are also no safeguards that once the drug company has the data, that cannot be passed on to another company which would ""try and locate them"" for their own self-interests.

If you have a link to these safeguards, then link them.

In fact, here is some evidence that you may be incorrect:

**Health Committee - care.data evidence** 

http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/WrittenEvidence.svc/EvidenceHtml/6788

From Nick Pickles, sitting on the Health Committee.

[Q19]

&gt; The specific point that is important there is that, when the Data Protection
Act was transposed from European law, there is legal opinion that the way the UK
transposed that directive left a loophole that did not criminalise re-identification. That is
not consistent across the rest of the European Union. I understand it is a specific problem
for the UK and Ireland, but, to speak to your problem, if you are allowing data out and you
have not criminalised deliberate re-identification, then you are magnifying the risk. If you
keep it in one place, you don’t then rely on the need to change the Data Protection Act as
well to close that loophole for third party re-identification, and, as Phil says, the more
copies that exist, the greater that risk becomes.


From Rosie Cooper, sitting on the Health Committee.

[Q182]

&gt; Surprise, surprise, I actually think this is a brilliant idea. I have opted out. Why have I
opted out? Because I don’t trust you. I don’t trust the performance I have seen here today
and I don’t consider myself to be a commodity to be bartered around by a group of
anonymous people. Let me tell you, without all this—the Committee know—I have a
cartilage problem with my knee, and Synexus wrote and asked if I would like to be part of a
clinical trial. How do they know I’ve got a dodgy knee? If that kind of thing is happening
now, then God help us when you lot get going with this.

# ` `

Finally,

&gt; ""...these records are used strictly for epidemiological research.""

Sure, if you can prove it of course. However you would need to show that the data cannot be passed onto another company which has nothing to do with epidemiological research.

&gt;

&gt;In the [American Revolutionary War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War) (1775–1783), France fought alongside the United States, against Britain, from 1778. French money, munitions, soldiers and naval forces proved essential to America's victory over the Crown, but France gained little except large debts.

&gt;[Benjamin Franklin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin) served as the American ambassador to France from 1776 to 1783. He met with many leading diplomats, aristocrats, intellectuals, scientists and financiers. Franklin's image and writings caught the French imagination – there were many images of him sold on the market – and he became the image of the archetypal new American and even a hero for aspirations for a new order inside France. The French goal was to weaken Britain, both to keep it from getting too powerful and to exact revenge for the defeat in the [Seven Years' War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War). After the American capture of the British invasion army at Saratoga in 1777, and after the French navy had been built up, France was ready. In 1778 France recognized the United States of America as a sovereign nation, signed a military alliance, went to war with Britain, built coalitions with the Netherlands and Spain that kept Britain without a significant ally of its own, provided the Americans with grants, arms and loans, sent a combat army to serve under [George Washington](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington), and sent a navy that prevented the second British army from escaping from Yorktown in 1781. In all, the French spent about 1.3 billion [livres](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_livre) (in modern currency, approximately thirteen billion U.S. dollars) to support the Americans directly, not including the money it spent fighting Britain on land and sea outside the U.S. 

&gt;French aid proved vital in the victory of the Americans seeking independence from Britain. The U.S. gained much territory at the [1783 Treaty of Paris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783\)), but France – after losing some naval battles – fared poorly there. It did get its revenge and made a new ally and trading partner. However the high debt France accumulated was a major cause of the [French Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution) in 1789.

He said: ""Those limits were really plucked out of the air. They were not based on any firm evidence at all. It was a sort of intelligent guess by a committee."" The committee's epidemiologist had confessed that ""it's impossible to say what's safe and what isn't"" because ""we don't really have any data whatsoever"", Mr Smith said. The former editor of the British Medical Journal said members of the working party felt obliged to produce the guidelines because of concerns over growing evidence of the chronic damage caused by heavy, long-term drinking.

Well just as an example this show reached its peak at 1.4 million views which is incredible considering Top Gear pulled in 5million views, especially being a programme that doesn't reach out to such a wide audience and isnt on at peak time sunday and is shown during the week. Its also not as widely advertised as top gear.

They had a lot of viewing figures for this Channel considering its viewing time was restricted ect. But all they will do is move the successful shows to bbc one or 2/4 which then maybe it does save money.
However i still think that the tv licence is outdated and needs to be removed. As said, all other channels are extremely successful so why wouldnt the bbc be the same?

true,Quietuus,eng-wight,Vectis,"I think the kind of dialogues that have been built up around the unemployed make it basically impossible for the system to help some people. The benefits system that was introduced by the previous government, though criticised for being bloated and inefficient, did have a lot of resources with which to help people. Long term unemployed would end up on intensive Welfare to Work schemes which could help screen people out with severe problems, and people could be sent on courses as part of the Future Jobs Fund. At the peak of the new Labour project, this included anything up to learning how to drive. People balk at that kind of expense to the taxpayer, but I think the thing that generally seems to be forgotten about unemployment benefits and back-to-work schemes is that they're a long term game, and they reap very quick utilitarian rewards. Someone who goes from the dole to working full time at national minimum wage is suddenly going to stop draining £3000+ in dole  (actually probably more like £4000 in most cases, when NI contributions are taken into account) from the national purse, whilst simultaneously paying nearly £2000 in in the form of income tax and NI stamps. So, if it takes some large one-off investment (a grand or two) to get someone into work, this quickly reaps rewards in the scheme of things, and if you can get people into long term employment even a failure rate of 50% makes the enterprise worthwhile.

Not really coming across as a shining example of quality programming the BBC needs, though I'm sure it's funny to watch.

If 'recording and pausing' (which I assume you mean to include fast-forwarding past the adverts) becomes the norm, then that *will* be a problem, because it won't be worth the advertisers' while to spend good money having their adverts ignored!

We're certainly in interesting times though.

Bare in mind, the topic / reddit post that you are stating this in is (to quote the article which prompted this post therefore sticking to exact topic at hand)

&gt; ""The Sunday Times reports that healthcare intelligence firm Harvey Walsh has bought a database including details of patients’ hospital admissions and operations.""

So when you say,

(A) ""The data cannot be traced back to an individual person, ...""

(B) ""...but has enough information to find correlations between changes in health and particular drug treatments.""

I am asking for a citation from you showing that the data being held at ""healthcare intelligence firm Harvey Walsh"" (quote from article), (that) ""the data cannot be traced back to an individual person"".  
As your post was in the thread-tree about the data being held there, being ""anonymous"" (as said by [RetepNamenots][1]), I am looking for evidence of this.

I am also asking for a citation or evidence on whether the information at Harvey Walsh ""has enough information to find correlations between changes in health and particular drug treatments.""

I get that canon matters, but, honestly, that's most likely the same as The Master's super powers and the random things some timelords were seen to do in the classic series (one of them seemed to be able to teleport and appear to the 3rd doctor as a tiny version of himself). Basically, it needed to happen in the story. Come up with your own explanation, and let that be enough. Just as long as you enjoy the show. Remember, 10 was always cobbling together electronics and making special devices and stuff. Maybe he had some way of doing it through some kind of accessory.

true,LordAnubis12,eng-sussex,Brighton,"Fair points, but I can't exactly afford a huge deposit and lock-in for the next 25 years at 21, and renting offers some benefits that, for now, are unavoidable. If they got rid of steep agent fees and introduced some basic landlord requirements so that you could actually do stuff to the house (our landlord seems fine with most reasonable requests) then I don't see why it can't become a more acceptable lifestyle. 

In the 2 years I've lived in this flat I've had 1 inspection *that I requested*. I realise I'm lucky in this, but that's my point - if these were some legal requirements from landlords (more so) then it would be much better and an easier addressing to the housing problem.  

&gt; More expensive than paying a mortgage while you are living there

The flat I live in would probably be about 200k to buy - how on earth am I meant to get a mortgage for that amount? 

My parents moved out at 21 and bought a house in the town they were born in, haven't moved from that town since. Is that a situation I'd like to be in? Not really, and renting enabled me to escape that situation.

Obviously renting long term isn't the best option, but the UK has a whole has a mentality that people who don't buy homes are idiots without realising that perhaps renting, for some people, is just easier.

Secondly if you can get it out leave it outside your house, scrap men will take that away in minutes, trust me, once they know its there it'll be gone. 
Thirdly im sure you can get kitchen appliances extremely cheap on gumtree, as for the cooker itself id go with gas.

I mean, he was a liar and a jerk in a lot of ways, and ""didn't care for them"", maybe.. he did seem to have a romanticism to his relationship with women. All of them had some sort of pull toward him, or he toward them, but I don't think he mistreated any of the women in any way. It could be seen as kind of crappy that he's in love with River his whole tenure, but he also has some back and forth flirtiness with Amy and Clara... but River uses her flirtiness in the same way, so I just always imagine it's part of their dynamic (can you imagine a River / Jack Harkness story?

* Bars and cafes are  usually the same thing, so I can get breakfast at 6.30am in the same place I might get a beer at 2am. They'll serve food until 10pm (also, free food with every drink - a 1 euro coffee comes with free cake, a 1.50€ beer gets me a slice of tortilla or pie or Russian salad or something). This makes it strangely family friendly, and you'll see kids in there until very late.

* Shops, museums and the like close at around 10pm in my neighbourhood, and people will hang around and chat in the street until about midnight if they don't want to go to a bar. This includes the elderly and children. There are musicians performing in the street (read: buskers) also, which gives a nice atmosphere.

* If you want to go out drinking heavily, there are a couple of neighbourhoods which are full of bars open until 4-8am or later, and if you want food there's usually bakeries, cafes or take-aways serving then as well (much better than what you'd get in the UK). It all spills onto the street, so if you don't want to drink you can just hang around with your mates and you don't have to buy anything because it's impossible to know who bought what from where.

* Servings are smaller but cheaper (1.50€ for 25-33cl beer on tap, 1€ for top notch local wine), making it possible to drink all night (11pm-5am), spend very little and still not be drunk if you pace yourself.

To me, it's stick or twist now. Everyone says he deserves another chance to appoint a good manager but even if he does I don't think he can resist poking his nose in and getting involved in football matters. He told AVB to play 4-4-2 for god sake. 

How can you ask him to leave it to the manager? What's the point, it's just daydreaming that he's ever going to do that. I honestly think there's so many things that he's done wrong which if he hadn't risen us from the abyss he would be hounded out at most other clubs now. 

Stratford, stubhub, sacking AVB with no reasonable replacement in mind, the lack of stadium info, that's all of the top of my head with no research too.

As far as Scottish Nationalism goes, the SNP are, historically, far from the only game in town.  Organisations like Settler Watch, Flame, the SNLA, SSG and Siol nan Gaidheal have had brief moments of support in certain communities and demonstrate that Scotland isn't incapable of sprouting ultranationalist or extremist groups. I have wondered in the past, especially given the sectarian links to Ireland, why it is that the brutality of Belfast never made it's way to Glasgow.  The kind of nationalism advocated - at least publicly - by the SNP is of a far milder flavour.

I don't know a great deal about the internal politics of the SNP but I've had dealings with councillors, MSPs and MPs on a professional and personal basis over the years and it strikes me that they are a rainbow coalition united by a common desire for Scottish independence and there's no reason to think that their support couldn't flee to other parties or individuals to the left or right subsequent to a ""yes"" vote in a referendum.

If you are flying VFR with no plan filed, you will get something like this

&gt;XXXXX you are leaving our service area, contact YYYYY on ZZZ.ZZMhz

The pilot will read back, normally thank them for the service, and contact the next area, often keeping the same squark, but between these areas they would change it.

As such no one would think twice to it 'dropping' off.

In IFR or with a flightplan, it takes a while for the next controller to realise you've not appeared on time.  That window of a few min was perfectly used.

This is the issue, the timing, is perfect, the fact ACARS was switched off just before this.  This is incredibly unlikely, I could go into lots of issues as to why, but I'm not rated for a trip seven, not even ATP, so I'll leave that to those who are better qualified.  However, mechanical failure in this circumstance is less probable than deliberate action.  This much is obvious.  It does not rule out completely mechanical failure, but it is very unlikely, combined with perfect opportune timing.  (Say the transponder failed being given the new squark, well you'd use the backup one, if that failed, you'd call someone on frequency, if that failed, you'd 121.5, with one of the many spare com boxes, if that failed, you'd use the immersat link.)  These are isolated systems.  Given the time between failures, if mechanical systems had been so bad everything had failed, the plane would unlikely be able to fly for so long, it is, after all, a fly by wire setup.

If I thought that was possible, for such things to fail, I wouldn't be a pilot, I would shred my license tomorrow.

All this information Malaysia Airlines would have had quite quickly (hours, not days), yet they didn't disclose it.

The information from RR via the uplink would have been available very quickly.

The fact they didn't search the homes of the flight crews immediately.

The Malay authorities did so much wrong.  They had people looking in the wrong area because they didn't communicate (or being charitable collate) the information.  They didn't inspect the people most likely responsible.

Given that Malay government has a policy that no terrorism has ever happened to them, ever.  Meanwhile they are hard line Islamic nut jobs operating within the nation, they were instrumental in Pakistan's nuclear program etc, it is very likely that the investigation would be warped by political desires, that the information made available to allies would be shaped to fit their message.

Chelsea seem to have trouble with scoring. ""

To copy-pasta my comment from a month ago because I think it is still on point and now I think more people will agree with me:

&gt;[–]Draracle 18 points 29 days ago*

&gt;What is happening now is rare. The top 4 is a mess and extremely tight, ~~in fact it isn't just top 4, Spurs are on our heels.~~ No one. I repeat, No one, will have a clean run in. Every team is dropping points, no one looks steady. This won't be ""squeaky bum time"", this will be a shit show.

&gt;I won't say we are likely to win, though I think we have a stronger bid than some. I will say no one is likely to win, but someone has to. You can't pick a team out of this mess and say ""they are the likely winners"". At best, maybe, you could pick 2 and say it is more likely that one of these 2 will win. But that is a stretch for sure.
In the first half of the season we gave 3 points to Arsenal, City, and Chelsea. We've settled the score with Arsenal and I think we will do the same (hopefully with the same flare) with the other two. Those results won't put us on top, but it will put us a game away from top.

&gt;Maybe I handle disappointment better than others, so I don't feel the need to insulate myself against the hope. Right now I'm buzzing with hope! This is the real shit right now. Gerrard knows it is near, close as it has ever been, you don't count yourself out because of the recent history of the clubs involved. You clench your fists tight, bite down hard, and drive this bitch home.

But I can't, which is why for now renting is the most cost effective way for me to improve my lifestyle/employment opportunities and quality of life in general. My point is that while on the whole renting is worse long term, in the short term it can have greater benefits such as flexibility of location which owning a house does not. 

As you say though - that's the problem - life less expensive for those able to afford it. While I'd love for rents to be better regulated etc, it would still be ignoring the key issue of housing supply and prices. 

I think for me the comparison is this (not directly rebutting you here, more thinking out loud) is that either, me and partner move to the north and get jobs in something fairly safe like Retail which I could do and get steady wage at, and then afford to buy a house earlier for the long term. 

Or, in the short term rent in Brighton where I have less cash value and less long term security, but much greater social capital and pleasure of life in general, as well as greater long term job prospects such as working towards skilled careers.

true,Keratome,null,null,"Past/Present :   
1.Defensive errors have cost us matches, deathblows when we cant score/create goals, how much will we rue not having a high quality LB who is not injured or recovering from injury  

2.Not enough playmakers , or players who step up and put the team on their back  
 
3.Poor service from the wings , forever frustrating  

4.We are crap at corners  
5.Tactically we have been outplayed in the some/most matches  
6. Injuries, new signings , haven't played enough together 
I could go on but the negativity is building up  
  
Future  
1.Kaboul and Verts is the best center pairing we have   

2.Lloris is really good, sounds obvious,don't have to worry about soft goals as once before and we can build a solid central defense on that  

3.Healthy Walker and rose (an improved version of himself or another LB) required , its not enough to ask players to switch positions esp defensively and not expect it to be exploited by the opposing manager   

4.Sandro needs to shoot at goal more often, kinda like lothar matthaeus/roy keane driving up from the deep (which admittedly he did today, shots were just closed down by the defence)    

5.Benteleb is pretty good , and I say this thinking of the future, (spurs have made an investment). No one can say he cost us a goal by his actions, in one match he was overrun but thats due to team formation  
6.The Dembele/Paulinho connundrum, it pains me to say this ,but they are playing as if they don't want to get injured pre-world cup. Both are sublimely talented but their minds are elsewhere, I don't know if they will both still be around next year, and with that attitude I couldn't care less. If however they come back committed to the cause, that's different ( I hope the latter is the case)  
7.Eriksen on the left wing, the only way I see this as tenable is that this is the position spurs see him playing in next season and are giving him playing time to familiarise himself. If LW is where you want him it means they have someone else in mind to play the 10. Here's the issue though, he is not defensively strong and as of now is not a box to box midfielder, therefore you need defensive cover, in fact you need 2 defensive minded midfielders behind him and not one i.e. Sandro who has to cover both sides of the park, and when sandro drifts over to cover, the cross ball is hit and we are exposed, happens over and over this season, except when paulinho and dembele split the defensive duties in midfield.  
8.Soldado...aye Soldado, he's like kagawa for united. You know he's talented but you can't find a spot for him, well you could, the coach just doesn't want to play him consistently for whatever reason, he's committed to the cause, great touch in and around the box and together with Ade make a good enough duo up front.  
9.Townsend,Lennon,Chadli havent played with distinction at all this season either because of injury,ability or lack of opportunity. This match townsend played better as he is interviewing for the trip to brazil, I expect him to be better if only for that reason.  
10. Lamela.....sigh. Is it too much too hope for, will we ever see him realise his potential in a spurs shirt, are we placing too much on his shoulders too early?   
  
Maybe spurs 2014-15 has a dream and it looks like this

Spurs (shaking my head), hate losing to those guys or anybody else for that matter, today we played hard, it was frustrating to not convert chances, they scored an early ""freaky goal"" and parked the bus for most of the match, I hope that this match emphasizes our areas that we need to improve on for the next match and the future

It's quite easy to read Moyes' tactics since he doesn't change them at all every week; two wide-men with crossing always in their mind. This doesn't necessarily work as proven both today and against Fulham, two recent examples of why he's flogging a dead horse with his incessant insistence on playing the standard 4-4-2 all the time.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Hi. Having done customer service in the states, I'll gladly give you the same prompt I wrote in for my line, so that it can help you. When the line picks up for you, respond with your company greeting - introduce yourself and establish a rapport by staying on queue, but not being afraid to deviate a little so long as it sticks to the basic company script. If you've been there for a while, most managers will exspect and be fine with that.

Now...Stateside, I noted that you would generally address everyone as sir, and as a Briton, visiting? I often felt like it wasn't sincere, which I feel is often the problem. You should get around this by establishing that they've reached customer service and...Do nothing. Say nothing other than ""How can I help you, and what would you prefer I address you by today?"". You should have an indication by the records on your computer screen, and most Britons will offer their first name, or simply ask that you call them mr. or miss, mrs. or ms; the variables differ from person to person. Rarely, unless the person is a complete dick with a sense of grandeur will they ask you to address them as sir.

Don't be afraid of being casual and chatty with your customer, so long as it's not *too* casual, in the way you might address friends in the pub - ask them if, aside from the incident that's bringing them to you if they're having a good day, what the weather is like, and other questions that are simply a matter of courtesy elsewhere - remember, it is important in teh allocated (often) 20 minutes that you're on the line with the customer, that you make the experience as relaxed for them as possible.",0,1395018213,null,0,1395044551,0,cg4dwpk,t3_20kh3q,t1_cg4dwpk,t3_20kh3q,null,1432938454,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

Arsenal still have to go to Everton as well, while also going for the FA cup.

I do the same thing often enough though with different ales from different places etc. When I can afford it, I do the same with a whisky. The most serious problem with alcohol consumption, I think, is getting drunk - using alcohol to numb feeling or to alter your mental state in some way is extremely unhealthy but drinking because you like wine or beer of whisky is not at all an issue. Equally drinking one glass of wine to relax is in my book a non-issue or perhaps a good thing. I'm a firm believer in treating yourself when you can and for no reason because it just improves your well-being hugely. What's the point of expertly crafted wine or blended whisky if you don't bloody enjoy it when you can. 

The people you highlight who get catatonic at the weekend but turn their noses up at people that drink in the week sound like people who can't control themselves when they drink and thus assume everyone else has the same problem. It's up to you to know what you can deal with. A light, small woman is not going to have the same response to one glass of wine as a muscular man but IMO drinking regularly is all part of exploring what you can work with; alcohol is certainly mind altering if only temporarily.  

I probably drink more on average than my other 20 something friends but I don't binge and I rarely get drunk. Also I'm aware of what I can function with and when I should stop and I think I can handle it better because I drink regularly. I'm probably biased because my parents drank a lot very regularly but I've never seen my father drunk and only seen my mother drunk as weddings and the like but never while casually drinking - neither has health problems or any related problems so it's never stopped me from drinking regularly too even if it is less than them.

# ` `

2008 Review which is discussed and referenced in detail in that and the 2012 document.

&gt; We are most concerned about the statement in the Handbook to the draft NHS
Constitution, page 24, last bullet point:

&gt; *“Research is a core part of the NHS because it enables the NHS to improve the 
current and future health of the population. Therefore, the NHS will do all it can to
give patients, from every part of England, with any illness or disease, a right to
know about research that is of particular relevance to them and, if they choose, to
take part in approved medical research that is appropriate for them. Patients can
therefore expect that a health professional or a research professional who owes
the same duty of confidentiality as a health professional may use care records, in
confidence, to identify whether they are suitable to participate in approved clinical
trials. Appropriate patients will be notified of opportunities to join in, and will be free
to choose whether they wish to do so, after a full explanation.”*

&gt; The NIGB accepts the importance of good clinical and epidemiological research in
improving healthcare delivery and outcomes for the population as a whole and also
the benefits that participation in clinical trials and research may bring to the
individuals involved personally.
We also appreciate the challenges and issues that the current system of inviting
patients to participate in research brings but are concerned that the proposal itself
is not on a sound legal basis and including it in the Constitution will not be helpful.

&gt; We propose that this statement should not be included in the Constitution. It is a
complex matter which requires further discussions outside the Constitution,
facilitated by the NIGB and PIAG (Patient Information Advisory Group), to find a way forward. [Our concerns and
conclusion are set out in more detail below]. As a Board we remain committed to
supporting and developing a process that improves access to research within the
existing legal framework.

# ` `

&gt; We are concerned that what is proposed is a fundamental change to clinical
practice. Whilst detailed implementation information is not available we believe it
will be at variance with the assurances given in the NHS Care Record Guarantee
for England and thus undermine patient’s rights to consent and confidentiality. As
the NIGB is the owner of the NHS Care Record Guarantee and one of its primary
duties is to protect patients’ rights to consent and confidentiality, this is obviously of
serious concern to us and requires further urgent discussion.

&gt; The NIGB recognises the value of timely information to allow patients opportunities
to participate in good research. However, we cannot accept the suggestion in this
paragraph that, without appropriate approvals through existing legal mechanisms,
anyone other than a member of the clinical team which is the guardian of the
clinical record should be allowed to use the clinical record, without the prior
consent of the patient, to identify patients to invite to participate in research.
GPs, for instance, are the Data Controllers of the patient records for their practice.

&gt; If they were to share information with ineligible people they would bear the legal
responsibility for doing this.

The NIGB then state very clear and solid points on their concerns.

# ` `

Please note though, that during the years of 2008 to 2012, the power over the data from GPs was changed and was not in the hands of the patients' GPs any more, but of the new Data Commissioner who now oversaw all the data from all GPs and other various places of the NHS.

# ` `

In 2012, the NIGB wrote in their new paper about the upcoming NHS constitution...

&gt; *Qu 1. What are your views on the proposed changes to strengthen patient involvement in the NHS Constitution?*

&gt; Our primary interest in this consultation is in relation to our remit described above
and limited to those sections that particularly concern patient information and the
associated responsibilities for the management of data and individual rights.
Our comments are derived from our experience of the health and social care
environment. These environments however, are undergoing significant change
whereby public facing services previously provided by statutory public authorities will
in the future also be provided by non-statutory independent and third sector
providers (any qualified provider). These arrangements are increasing the extent to which confidential patient data is collected, used and shared, and whilst the primary
purpose is for the provision of care, data is also used for business needs such as
billing and service evaluation and planning, which is often not fully explained to
patients and may exceed their normal expectations.

&gt; In our opinion, the NHS Constitution not only should be protective of patient’s rights,
it needs to be in order to gain trust and confidence in the system to support NHS
strategy and new initiatives. We welcome the proposal to strengthen the NHS
Constitution with an amended principle that puts the patient at the heart of everything
the NHS and Social Care do and fully support the creation of a new pledge to involve
them in care planning decisions and provision of a written care record.

&gt; We see this as creating an opportunity for the service providers and commissioners
of those services to be open and transparent by explaining to the patients, and
ensuring they understand that their confidential personal information is shared with
others along the care pathway. It is of particular importance that they also
understand how their information is used for non-care purposes, whether or not they
have a choice as to that data being shared in a way that would identify them. The
first Data Protection Act principle requires personal data to be processed fairly and
lawfully, and fairness generally requires a Data Controller to be transparent or clear
and open about the way in which information will be used

&gt; In our previous response to the first consultation on the NHS Constitution in October
2008, we recommended the inclusion of a reference to the NHS Care Record
Guarantee for England by way of providing further detailed guidance to patients and
staff about how information is used, patient’s rights and the obligations of the NHS.
This advice unfortunately was not taken, but we re-iterate it now for the very same
reasons.

They again go into the points you made in your post and also the effects of how bad spectacles like this can have on the NHS and on patient confidence.  
I highly recommend reading the reports for a good ""senior"" (as in rank in reference to the NHS) viewpoint and advice on how they believe the data / research situation should be addressed and approached.

# ` `

However, even with all of the recommendations, it seems that the Data Controller and the Health &amp; Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) are ignoring the advice of the NIGB.

But you are right, the fact that he has said he doesn't want to play second fiddle to anyone, while it shows ambission it is also short-sighted on his part.  He should absolutely leap at the chance to coach under someone like LVG (if we are actually in the mix and it isn't just a rumour), he very well may become a solid manager in his career but he has a great deal to learn before that day comes...he should be falling over himself to be an assistant under a top notch coach.

The guy is passionate and ambitious, if he approaches learning to be a manager with that same passion and ambition under a top flight manager he could really improve his ability.
