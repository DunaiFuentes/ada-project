true,backtowriting,null,null,"Some of this article is predicated on the feminist theory that sexist comments are on the same spectrum with violence against women.  That there's a pervasive cultural misogyny which is turning all women into victims.

I'm skeptical.

First off - yes, women *are* more likely than men to be subjected to sexual violence and rape.  (And men are more likely to be the victim of homicide.)  But, this is because of biological differences and it's the same in every culture which has ever existed.  Unfortunately, men are biologically more predisposed to seek sex through coercion, violence and rape.  They're also likely to have evolved to be more biologically predisposed to violence in general. 

(Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe there are societies throughout history in which women have raped and killed men more than the reverse.  If so, then let me know.)

Having said that.  That's no reason why we should accept rape and/or violence against women.  And we don't!  Rape is considered a heinous crime by virtually all men.  And violence against women is now considered unacceptable in our culture and under the law.  

Rape still happens for the same reason that murder and bank-robberies happen.  A low percentage of people will resort to crime and violence to get what they want.  It's not because society has a 'murder culture' or a 'bank-robbery culture'.  Similarly, we don't have a 'rape culture'.

Nevertheless, are NY women victims who live in fear?  

I'm by no means discounting or trying to minimize the women who have been subject to violence, but feminists have a tendency to play on the victimhood of women. Thus, the countless dodgy feminist statistics about the prevalence of rape and sexual violence, in which [the true figures have been grossly inflated for ideological purposes.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cdc-study-on-sexual-violence-in-the-us-overstates-the-problem/2012/01/25/gIQAHRKPWQ_story.html)

What feminists don't tell you is that the prevalence of rape in The West is probably the lowest that has been achieved in *any* societies in the world.  And that the incidence of rape has likely been falling, quite significantly, for decades.  Rape will always be with us, but there has never been a safer time or place for women than in modern Western societies.  

I suspect this comment will be controversial.  But do you want reddit to be a place in which you're only exposed to ideas you agree with?

Edit:

&gt;[The number of rapes per capita in the United States has plunged by more than 85 percent since the 1970s, and reported rape fell last year even while other violent offenses increased, according to federal crime data.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/18/AR2006061800610.html)

...

&gt;""Overall, there has clearly been a decline over the last 10 to 20 years,"" said Kim Gandy, president of the National Organization for Women. ""It's very liberating for women, in terms of now being able to be more free and more safe.""

Our transition from defensive phase to attacking phase got bogged down all season because we didn't have anyone in the CDM position who gave us forward penetration.  Funnily enough, it was probably Bentaleb who did the best job at this out of all our midfielders, but he lacked people ahead of him making quality movements off the ball.

As much as I want to see Danny Rose out of our side, this is our biggest problem, and it only served to put constant pressure on our full backs, because we continually lost the ball in the CDM area with our fullbacks up the pitch.  It meant Rose (and Naughton on the right) were almost constantly on the back foot.

I still believe Dembele could fulfil that role with some serious work on his one touch passing.  The problem isn't so much that he's a bad passer, but that he's too slow to release the ball once he gets it... the man loves to dribble!  By the time he sizes up a pass, the opponents have either shut down the option or his teammates have stopped making the run, which means he ends up just stopping and passing sideways or back.

The fact is, we are not. We don't allow illegal immigration, but the Home Office is completely incapable of stopping it. We're an island, we get a lot of foreign students coming in, English is a very common 2nd language and we have a large international image. All of that makes us a very attractive location for illegal immigrants. All we can do is increase funding for enforcement and get a Home Secretary that isn't utter shit.

We intervened in Libya, which was mildly successful and affordable. But now their government threatens to let in hundreds of thousands of illegals into the EU if they don't get more money. That is a huge example of the lack of influence other countries have on a country like Libya. We helped set their government up, but ultimately they act in their own interests. No country answers to us, we don't have the ability to say ""stop this"" or ""do something about this issue"". Just because we drop a few bombs does not entitle us to call the shots. 

What would you do in the case of Zimbabwe, for example? We have many refugees from that country. How would you have solved the problem instead? Zimbabwe's problems stem from Mugabe and his militia groups turning the country into a basket case. We can hardly send in some white farmers to help them. The only solution would be to overthrow the government and run the country again. How much would that cost? Would you be willing to pay for another 10 year long war against pro-Mugabe militants? How much more in tax would you pay for that one single war. I'm sure the cost of refugees is far less than the cost of launching a ground war, which is what many interventions would require...

We already provide development aid to countries that are struggling, but you can't simply provide aid and solve all problems. Corrupt officials and governments get in the way. Political and military conflict gets in the way; and we don't have the money to peacekeep in 10 different countries to prevent corruption.

Taking in refugees is the best we can do with what we have. We don't control the world so we do our bit to help by taking in our fair share of refugees; far less than the countries that actually neighbour war-zones.

We live in the real world, not some paradise where the UK runs the world. If you're looking for a perfect solution, you're not going to find one.

Of course Suarez is an attack by himself, and Sturridge has improved a lot.

Still think we should go for Kono/Sanchez/Pedro/Griezmann. Then i think we have a complete squad, with having Can as a Gerrard replacement. 
My only concern will be Glen Johnson, which has not been impressive. Wisdom is coming back though to be in the squad which will give us more players to pick from. Kelly will probably be moved to centre back, mostly because he is already starting to loose his speed of all the injuries.

Accommodation usually works like this. In the first undergraduate year you can apply to stay in the halls of residence, and that's what most first year students opt to do. These halls are on campus. That can be a great idea as you meet new friends and you're always together (though I have noticed they have knocked some halls down lately, so I'm not sure how many spaces there are now). Then by the time the second year comes around, you and some friends rent a flat together, and that can be anywhere in the city. The city is very well connected to the University so don't worry about that. I live easily within walking distance to the city centre.

If you aren't eligible to stay in the halls, or you simply don't want to, then you 	can rent a flat on your own. I did this for a little while during my PhD, but it's certainly more expensive. My first flat was 350 pounds a month (shared with 4 others), second flat was 240 pounds a month (shared with 2 others), then I lived on my own for a bit with was 550 pounds a month and now I'm sharing with one other guy (who was sharing with me in the previous flats) and we pay 375 a month each. I have always lived around Fountain Park/Dalry area and it's been great. Hope that gives you some kind of idea about costing.

On how good the university is, that can vary by subject, it depends what you're studying. Food has got a lot better on campus recently, the campus itself is amazing certainly, and the University as a whole has a great outside reputation.

Overall, Heriot-Watt is ok as a university, but there can be quite a variation on subject.  You'd be best to visit it in person before studying there, but here are my thoughts as a former student there.
 
For linguistics, it's supposedly the best in the UK. For brewing and distilling, it's one of only two universities in the UK where you could study that. For other science and business courses it's middling in reputation, not shit but not top in the research field.


I've heard anecdotally on reddit that undergraduate teaching quality can be patchy between subjects, however in national surveys of teaching quality the students at Heriot-Watt are much happier than those at Edinburgh. 

What are you studying? 
There are various ranking exercises performed by e.g. The Times or Guardian newspapers which you can look at to see how well it does compared to ye rest of the country.

I'd like to give two answers to what I like most, I hope nobody will mind.  First, I love story telling, and Doctor Who is all about stories.  Its obviously been pointed out that with its format you can tell almost any kind of story, from romance to whodunnit (no pun intended) murder mystery to action adventure, to historical drama.  For a lot of people, especially I find with new fans, they focus on the story of the Doctor.  But to me, when the show focuses too much on telling his story, that is when the show falls flat.  The best episodes in its history could be told without the Doctor completely and would still be amazing.  Stories like The Talons of Weng-Chiang, the Caves of Androzani, The Dalek Invasion of Earth, The Empty Child/Doctor Dances, or The Robots of Death.  I'm not saying I don't like the Doctor, because I very much do, but look at something like the 1996 TV movie.  Its all about the Doctor, and while Paul McGann is amazing and became my all time favorite Doctor, there just isn't a good story to back him up and look at the result.
  
The second thing I like most about Doctor Who is that it changes and can always be refreshed.  I'm not talking about the actors either, although that's part of it.  It's the fact that a new producer can come into the show and completely change things that on another show could never be changed, but it still remains Doctor Who.  Look at the Pertwee years for example.  If seasons 7 thru 11 didn't have ""Doctor Who"" in the title sequence and you didn't refer to the Doctor by name, anyone would be forgiven for believing it wasn't the same show as seasons 6 or 12.  Similarly the differences between the Hinchcliffe/Williams eras and the start of the Nathan-Turner era were enormous despite the Doctor remaining the same and probably saved the show from cancellation.

I think it's great if possible but as you say redesigning roads in a congested area is hugely challenging. I'm a motorcyclist, cyclist and driver and feel that ultimately the main road users will always be vehicles. Even if we cut car use, we'll always need large commercial vehicles and buses to be able to use roads. So reducing their size is unfeasible. 

Personally I don't wear a helmet when I ride in London. But I think all motorcyclists develop a hyper awareness, anticipating problems, which I transfer when cycling. I don't listen to music, I don't race everywhere, I don't jump red lights. Now I'm not foolish enough to consider my experience equivalent to evidence, but when lobbies hail Amsterdam as a model to follow they ignore the fact that in Amsterdam almost everyone:

1. Has a fairly heavy, slow bike
2. Obeys laws of the roads
3. Doesn't wear a helmet

It's also a fundamentally different city, with far fewer vehicles in the centre with tiny roads but a highly developed and heavily used canal network. I think more parts of central London should have complete vehicle bans, with only pedestrian and bike access. But to suggest that for zones 2 outwards is unrealistic.

From the beginning of this thread I have maintained one basic point: ""low skilled immigrants displace British workers"". Here's an [article](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10680436/Low-skilled-workers-most-affected-by-immigration-in-recession-says-report.html) summarizing a govt report saying exactly that. (Also it's from the UK) By ignoring that fact and attempting to make it about race we are selling British workers short. That is the one basic fact I want to hear you acknowledge before we can have an honest discussion about the greater economic impact etc, but you can't even do that. 

Instead, your petty name calling and attempts to shame me into silence by making the argument into something it's not have done nothing but prove the exact sort of pompous and ignorant cultural superiority that I was trying to illustrate with my very first comment.

true,doeboy73,null,null,"Although some other fans have suggested we go for the likes of Lampard, Ferdinand, Lescot, etc; other fans feel we should not be aiming for players at the end of their careers, as this is the strategy that got us relegated and massively in debt in the 2012/13 season.

QPR need to be thinking about the long-term, that means young hungry talent. While Tony Fernandes has spoken about recruiting from lower leagues Redknapp's renowned for his love of older PL players he's worked with before. A balance will need to be found.

With this in mind, many think that meeting the requirements of FFP could help save our club.

**Finances:**

This is important, for a QPR fan to know.

When Tony Fernandes bought his 66% share of the club in the Summer of 2011, for around £40m, QPR were in debt somewhere between £10-30m.
Accounts for the 2012/13 season reported debts of £175m, with a loss for that season of £80m.

You'll see some non-QPR fans saying QPR have a wage bill bigger than some of the top European clubs. They are referring to figures from the 2012/13 season, they are not relevant to the current squad of players. Particularly as last summer 16 players were loaned out or left QPR.

Another inaccuracy commonly stated by non-QPR fans is that some of our players were on over £100k per week. Our top paid player was/is Joey Barton on £70k per week. Aside from him, in the 2011/12 season, no QPR player was on more than £65k per week. Still a huge amount of money, but not the 100's of thousands some people keep repeating to each other.

It's sensible to guess the club is now something like £200m in debt. the key thing to remember is that this is all money loaned by the 2 main shareholders (Tony Fernandes &amp; Lakshmi Mital). In a recent Fans forum, Fernandes stated he'd likely just give the money to the club. So failing the FFP regulations is the only danger we have right now.

**The shareholder split:**

* Tony Fernandes (represents a group of friends from Air Aisia): 66%

* Lakshmi Mital (represented by fan's favourite Amit Bhatia, you'll have seen him in the 4 year plan): 33%

* Fans (though these share certificates are likely worthless): 1%

Fernandes is a millionaire, with assets around £400m. Lakshmi Mital is a billionaire and the 8th richest person in the UK. There are interesting stories surround Bhatia/Mittals dealings at QPR with Bernie Ecclestone &amp; Flavio Briatore (the 2 who previously owned the 66% shares). That's a whole other post in itself.

**What are the main characteristics of QPR in the past 25 years?**

**Early 90's:** QPR are one the clubs who first join the Premier league. Finishing top London club &amp; 4th in 1993/4 season. We then sell Les Ferdinand, the next season we are relegated.

**Late 90's:** Life in the 2nd tier of English football.

**End of the 90's/early 00's:** Life in the 3rd tier of English football. 2001: Ex-QPR player Ian Holloway is our manager and saviour - a short golden era in QPR's recent history, with several players and a manager who are QPR fans and manage promotion on an annual budget of £0. Ian Holloway is later controversially sacked as a result of a board take-over by Gianni Paladini - who you saw crying in the 4 year plan. Paladini is never liked by QPR fans.

**Mid-00's:** Back in the 2nd tier of football. The club is in and out of financial receivership. Fans contribute money, collected in plastic buckets, to buy a new player, who turns out to be crap. Alleged Italian mafia involvement and 'pistol whippings' in the board room. The club is about to go into receivership.

**2007:** Flavio Briatore buys QPR for about £200k. Attempts to tun it into a ""*Boutique club*"", despite it being built next to a council housing (project) estate and there being no room for your legs when you sit down.

**2010/11:** the Neil Warnock era. Flavio Briatore steps away from the club, handing his shares to Ecclestone, due to him being suspended from F1. Amit Bhatia takes charge, appoints Warnock. Within 17 months QPR have gone from relegation fodder to Championship league winners, putting QPR back in the top league for the first time in 15 years.

**Summer 2011:** Fernandes buys the 66% stake from Ecclestone, having 10 days left of the transfer window, splurging cash like it's going out of fashion. Warnock is sacked in Jan 2012. Mark Hughes is appointed manager, QPR stay up by the skin of thier teth in that famous PL game against Man City. Mark Hughes then goes about spending many £millions. Fernandes is very very niaive and keeps signing the cheques.

**2012/13:** QPR relegated after winning just 4 games all season, amid player turmoil and severe disharmony.

**Instability:**
QPR has had 16 managers in the past 10 years, been in and out of financial receivership, had it's debt taken from £20m to £200m in 3 years and jumped in and out of 3 different leagues. The one very important thing QPR needs is stability.

---

&gt;__To be announced__ (__TBA__), __to be confirmed__ (__TBC__), and __to be determined__ (__TBD__) are [placeholder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placeholder_name) terms used very broadly to indicate that although something is scheduled or expected to happen, a particular aspect of that thing remains to be arranged. Although the phrases are often used interchangeably, they have subtle differences. ""To be announced"" implies that the aspect so designated may have already been determined, but is not yet suitable for public announcement. ""To be confirmed"" suggests that a decision has been made but awaits confirmation, although it is also used to indicate that the aspect to be scheduled remains open. Other similar phrases sometimes used to convey the same meaning, and using the same [abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation), include __to be ascertained__, __to be arranged__, __to be advised__, __to be adjudicated__, __to be done__, __to be decided__, and __to be declared__.

On the players, what would you say we have now in terms of young hungry players vs older vets?  In every sport I've watched, the best teams usually have a balance of young, hungry players surrounded by veteran leaders who know what it takes to get it done and who will keep the young players in line.  I would think that the best course of action in most cases would be to seek that balance.  

On the FFP regulations, how different are they for teams in the Championship versus teams in teh Premier league?  Is it about the same restriction on how much of a loss you can take and it only looks different due to increased revenue?  I could definitely see why people think they should save teh team but I guess it also depends on how severe the upcoming fines are.

**Lallana** - I can see why some are saying £25m is too much, it is a lot of money. However I think Lallana is a really exciting player who fits our system perfectly. He can play on the wing or in midfield (like yesterday for England), this is the versatility that Rodgers wants. Regarding the fee, I feel £20m would be a fair price. He is an English international and I can see him getting better and better. Why are people so against spending £25m on Lallana but are so for spending £15 on Kono and £20 on Mkitharyan who were unknown (not saying not worth it, *but not tried and tested in a big european league*).

**Lovren** - A divisive target in terms of quality. Some are saying we should be aiming higher. At Lyon he played at RCB and at Southampton/Croatia he has played at LCB. This is the versatility Rodgers is screaming for in defence. When Sakho and Agger were injured, we had Kolo at LCB. If Skrtel gets injured we have Kolo at RCB. See the issue here? If Lovren becomes a starter then if his partner gets injured, he can shift over. Also Lovren is seen as the defensive leader that Rodgers wants/needs. To me this transfer makes absolute sense and he was absolutely beast for the first 6 months of the season. Not sure about the fee on this one, for someone who could be so integral i'd say the £15 million touted is a fair one. 

**Lambert** - Delighted. Makes sense in every way. £4m. Case closed. 

**Can** - One for the future i'm sure, but has experiences in the Bundesliga and CL. Not so sure on his qualities as I haven't seen him, but he is versatile and if Bayern put a buy-back clause in his contract then i'm sure he is good enough. 

**Moreno** - Played for Spain last night. You know, the reigning World and European champions? So did Torres though, maybe I shouldn't have used that point. Anyway, Real and Chelsea were after him. He is a fast and attacking LB. Apparently not too convincing at defending but he is only 21 and will only improve. Very excited about this one.

Bit of background on the rankings is on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rankings_of_universities_in_the_United_Kingdom). Again if HW is known for what you are going into then the general rankings are obsoleted by that. 

[Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/education/table/2013/jun/03/university-league-table-2014) places HW at 18, a good rank and even above the likes of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Kings College London, but to be honest by reputation those are a class above. 

The [complete university guide](http://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings) (with their time machine to 2015), places HW at 33, a bit more what I had been assuming, bearing in mind that is still a good score only just outside the top quarter in a country generally good for universities. 

[The Times](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2013-14/world-ranking/region/europe) puts HW somewhere between 301-350 in Europe, I'm not at all familiar with European universities so I've no idea how reasonable that is. They do offer [quite a lot of data](http://uk-universities.timeshighereducation.co.uk/l/20/Heriot-Watt-University) though.


Edinburgh is expensive to buy property and this is reflected in the rents. The rental market also isn't too great. Perhaps partly due to the huge numbers of students coming in at one time making that season a suppliers market, a lot of landlords really do not have to be competitive on quality. There's also loads of ""landlords"" who bought a flat as a 2nd pension, or a pad for their kids studying here or whatever and they are so half-arsed at it. On top of which there are a lot of old properties here which can be quirky at best. There are lots of good properties it is just that, as an Edinburgh renter I generally assume it will take a while to look for a new flat and not to bother looking around the start of the new student year. 

That said, in the first year I recommend staying in the halls. I don't know about HW specifically, but in general this is by far the most convenient and excellent for making the friends.

&gt;

&gt;Three national __rankings of universities in the United Kingdom__ are published annually – by *The Complete University Guide*, *[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian)* and jointly by *[The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times)* and *[The Sunday Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times)*. Rankings have also been produced in the past by *The Daily Telegraph* and the *Financial Times*.

&gt;The primary aim of the rankings is to inform potential undergraduate applicants about UK universities based on a range of criteria, including entry standards, student satisfaction, staff/student ratio, academic services and facilities expenditure per student, research quality, proportion of Firsts and 2:1s, completion rates and student destinations.   All of the league tables also rank universities on their strength in individual subjects.

true,68656c6c6f,null,null,"Initially I was going to advise a student account with 0% interest but seeing as you already have one, the next best thing is to go for a student credit card or a 0% credit card. You need money in the immediate situation but have around £30 a day coming in so if you're clever and careful, you should have no problem keeping up with minimum payments for a 0% credit card until student finance kicks in. Your next priority after that is to pay off the credit card and close the account (or keep it, up to you) and then the overdraft.

As someone who has personally just been through this, my next advise would be to ask friends. Yes it'll hurt your pride and you may think it'll ruin friendships but as long as you're careful with the money and pay it back on time (maybe even with a bit of interest), I don't see a reason for it to affect anything. Obviously only ask extremely good friends.

Finally, don't rely on student finance to pay anything back because you'll get in a cycle of borrowing, using student finance to pay it back then using what you paid back again because you have nothing to live off. Where you can, get a job or earn extra money doing small things like gardening/washing cars/fixing laptops etc. (Literally anything!) and pay it off that way IF you can. Also, maybe have a look at charities and see if you can find a local charity that may be able to help with housing costs etc. It doesn't hurt and you can always volunteer with them and help someone else in need! :) 

Edit: Every time I use my student credit card to buy something, it is 0% interest for 30 days or something like that I think.

Those are two separate things. If he actually *had* committed an offense, then I wouldn't object to him being arrested even if it was based on ""suspicion"" as long as he wasn't *convicted* on ""suspicion.""

But I think *you* need to look up what ""suspicion"" of doing something means. It doesn't mean the officer can say ""I'm fairly sure this guy is breaking *some* law here but I don't know which, so I'll arrest him now and work it out later."" It's not enough to just say ""Yeah he's probably committing some kind of public order offence,"" that's not specific enough.

The idea of 'reasonable suspicion' just means that there's reason to suspect they've committed a specific crime, such as carrying a knife or drugs or something which is difficult to prove with evidence until you use ""suspicion"" (ie. they're acting shady as fuck) to give them a pat-down and then find the drugs or whatever.

I really don't believe there are so many women who think women are less intelligent than men, that doesn't sound like a likely reason.

 I think it probably comes down to natural differences in desire to compete, naturally the genders have developed in such that men naturally have more desire to compete.

Keep working with your brother whenever you can until you get something more permenent. 

No matter what your university says when you call them, keep calling them, keep telling them how much difficulty you're in, keep asking for help. The new term isn't too far away and they should be able to kick in and start helping soon, you could also call Student Finance directly to modify your application for next term (if necessary) and see if there is anything they can do in the mean time. 

Do consider selling anything valuable you have on eBay or similar if you can bare to part with it, don't sell anything you can't replace, but games consoles, clothes, games, etc, can all be bought back further down the line when you're back on your feet. 

See how much it would cost to cancel your phone plan, £30 a month is a lot. If your parents signed up for it, you may be able to hand it off to them and say they can cancel it if they want and leave them with the cancellation fee if they choose to do so. GiffGaff offer very good rolling monthly plans from £7.50 with lots of calls, texts and data.

Nets are a great (and cheap) way to prevent mosquito bites. Antimalarial medication is pretty effective at killing the parasite if it enters your blood stream (although sometimes the parasite develops resistance against the medication, so its not 100% guaranteed).

**Lovren**, on the other hand, I wouldn't be displeased with. He's a great player and has done extremely well for Southampton last season, so I wouldn't mind seeing him move to the Reds. He'd fit in well at the back - however I was slightly disappointed Liverpool's 40m double-swoop fell through. 

In terms of the third Southampton player, **Lambert**, I am extremely happy to see him come to the Reds, assuming he's all clear with medical. He was a Youth for Liverpool and to my knowledge is a supporter. He'll perform even better as he won't be trying to impress other clubs, but to put the club he feels attached to most, forward. 

In regards to **Can** and **Moreno**, I wouldn't mind seeing Can move to Anfield, however I haven't heard much of Moreno among the other transfer targets so I don't have any strict opinion on him moving.

This requires proper infrastructure to support this style of cycling alongside a change in culture. In Europe most people know someone who cycles regularly. Here cyclists are treated like a nuisance on the road to drivers. 

Don't get me started on the fact that when a driver hit and kills a cyclist they are let off with a sickeningly low punishment because those sentencing them share their same prejudice against cyclists.

I don't even think the opposition to it would be that great - do older, more conservative voters really care that much either way? I don't know. I think Labour could add it to their manifesto. Here's the Green Party's policy on cannabis:

&gt; Cannabis would be removed from the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act. The possession, trade and cultivation of cannabis would be immediately decriminalised, roughly following the Dutch model. The trade in Cannabis would be the subject of a Royal Commission, with a view to establishing a fully legalised, controlled and regulated trade. Small-scale possession of drugs for personal use would be decriminalised. The starting point would be advice to policing authorities to caution rather than prosecute for offences of drug possession for personal use and to refer offenders to the health-care services. Subsequently, regulations would be brought forward removing criminal sanctions for simple possession of controlled drugs for personal use. The recommended sentences for small-scale supply would be non-custodial options. The possession of pipes made for the use in connection with smoking of opium would no longer be a criminal offence. A Royal Commission or similar body would be established to review currently controlled drug classifications, within a legalised environment of drug use. This commission would, after wide consultation, consider and recommend frameworks of social, economic and health conditions for drug use and supply.",0,1401536183,null,0,false,0,chvlmgf,t3_26y4ea,t1_chvlmgf,t3_26y4ea,null,1434032173,108,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,108

true,forgottenoldusername,eng-manchester,It is indeed grim up north.,"There is a few reports out there that suggest wearing a helmet actually increases the likelihood of being involved in some sort of offage.
There is also evidence to suggest that when helmet use was made a legal requirement in parts of Australia, cycling participation decreased.

Sure, a helmet might help in an accident. But it'd be interesting to see if the apparent increased risk of an accident outweighs the likelihood of a helmet seriously reducing your injuries.

It's also be interesting to see if the benefits of cycling/a more health population actually reduces premature mortality more so than the use of a helmet does, therefore suggesting it was actually counter-productive to make helmets a legal requirement in Australia in terms of public health and well-being. 

Personally I think the answer to the first one will be nope, wearing a helmet is better duuuuuh.

The second one though, I'm not sure that'd be as clear. If forcing people to wear a helmet puts them off riding a bike and getting much needed physical activity, then I would not be surprised at all if that has more of an effect on mortality than accidents do...

To me, that's pretty sound reasoning but the study could be more extensive.

So, in all the time your dad spent cycling *before* his accident without the helmet, not wearing a helmet could have caused drivers to give him more room and reduced the likelihood of an accident.  A helmet would have helped in your dad's accident, no one is denying that.  But what if not wearing a helmet actually caused him to avoid a worse accident in which a helmet wouldn't have helped anyway?

You can't necessarily expect there to be metalworks in city centres (or certainly not many), and in some areas the amount of firms will be little or none. You'll basically have to move to where work is. I'd recommend looking through JobCentre listings, or going through some employment agencies (Reed, Adecco, Manpower and there will be more niche ones for your metalwork) to get an idea on locations and wages. Being a girl shouldn't be a disadvantage. Some bigger employers will encourage it that's for sure. Though I'm sure in Canada this is male-dominated, and it is here too, so you'll have to expect 'banter'. Don't accept abuse or sexism, but at the same time a lot of things will be light-hearted. 

Yes you should expect a deposit. Even dodgy landlords found on Gumtree ask for a deposit. Since you haven't lived here and have no history here some will even ask for 6 months rent up front (less likely using Gumtree or SpareRoom, but this will likely happen with a real estate agent).

Banking you can deal with easily, you don't need one until you arrive. Every bank offers a free account so pick based on who has a branch near you (if you like using branches) or who has the easiest online banking system, for example. 

You probably shouldn't expect much more than minimum wage. I'm not saying it can't happen, just don't expect too much, especially once you first arrive, but once you're settled you can start branching out.

Overall the economy is improving, but youth unemployment remains quite high so don't be too disheartened if it takes time to find suitable work (this is also why wages might be lower).",0,1401541352,null,0,false,0,chvmlok,t3_26xmvi,t1_chvmlok,t3_26xmvi,null,1434032708,4,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,4

The general thought is by asking cyclists to wear safety gear you are making a healthy, cheap, congestion solving mode of transport seem more dangerous than it really is. The net result is less people cycling, more people in cars...which results in a mountain of negative environmental and personal health problems....which indirectly costs more lives than insisting people wear helmets.

But yes - skilled workers are definitely good for the economy. Unskilled workers *can* be good as they can do the jobs which a lot of people from the host country feel is ""beneath"" them (for example manual labour), but which is required for a stable economy.

The problem is when there are racial tensions, or there's a high unemployment rate in those migrating - basically, if migrants don't contribute to the economy, there is strain on the economy, but this acts in an extremely similar way to just regular members of the country - if *they* don't contribute to the economy, there's a large strain on it.

Immigration is definitely good for the economy, so long as the migrants don't just reap benefits. However, there are also problems within our country - if our own population (of non-migrants) reap benefits, it causes the same problem.

So basically... immigration, provided we get employable people (who in theory end up getting employed), and so providing it's restricted (you have to have some sort of job to go to or have a certain standard of qualification), helps our country to get a *better* economy.

Listening to the video - *they* are as obstructive throughout as possible. If you're going to step out and protest against police officers dressed in a high vis jacket and mock-police hat - it's realistic to assume any officer coming across this will ask *why*. 

It's at this point (1:25 roughly) the officer points at Peers - possibly his finger knocks into him but Peers goes on to say he doesn't want to be assaulted? 

Presumably Peers is a Premier League footballer if he considers *that* an assault (which we can clearly see on camera is not - I get pushed into on trains harder than that during rush hour and people would laugh if I cried assault). 

The camera operator and Peers go on to make claims of assault. 

Frankly I don't blame the officer in this case for having had enough. He didn't ask hard questions - he didn't tell them to do or not do anything (lawfully or unlawfully) and they had an obstructive attitude throughout that did nothing but raise the tension of the situation. 

You say the officer was trying to ""stitch them up"" but I really don't see how - they stitched themselves up. There are better ways to handle that situation and they chose the ""be a twat"" route.

Why are you not in Brussels, right now, with your fist shaking ready to punch someone, because of they way the EU treats immigrants *outside* the EU?

EU member states can accept diddly-squat from the rest of the world. India is churning out more graduates every year than we have people. There are huge markets that the EU has shut off (not to mention the cruel way the CAP keeps most of African farmers in poverty).

There are two dials at the moment, for immigration. There's an EU dial, and a rest-of-the-world dial. As it stands, the EU dial is on full-tilt, and the rest-of-the-world is stuck at zero. I think immigration needs to be open, and controlled for the rest of the world, and open and controlled for the EU.

The other is getting rid of all the deductions and loopholes in the tax system (some good, some bad, most put in for good reasons but end up being exploited.)  

The first aspect is what you were talking about.  The flat tax that UKIP were talking about is progressive not regressive because you would only be paying tax on your income about a certain amount.  Maybe around £15,000.  Would this be a tax cut for millionaires?  Well top earners would have a lower top rate of tax, yes.  But people earning that much rarely pay the top rate of tax anyway.  They get their income from other sources (like company profits) which are taxed at a lower rate. 

[Plenty of countries have a flat tax rate, by the way, it's really no big deal.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_tax#Countries_that_have_flat_tax_systems)

Now, the other part is getting rid of the deductions and loop holes, our complicated tax system.  This could be a great thing, if it is done right, because it could force companies and high earners to pay a fairer share of tax.  For example, what if the rate of capital gains tax and company earnings was the same as the income tax rate?  That would bring in a lot more money.  But, of course, a lot of tax credits are of benefit to ordinary people (child tax credits etc. etc.)

Imagine you have a computer which is programmed to display a black screen if it's currently showing a white screen, and display a white screen if it's currently showing a black screen. In practical terms, this means it will rapidly switch back and forth between black and white, making it display a grey screen.

Robert is an inventor. He works for years trying to come up with time travel, and finally succeeds. He travels back in time, and passes along financial advice to his earlier self.

Robby is a multimillionaire. He had a lot of promise as an engineer and inventor, but never pursued it after a mysterious stranger gave him a ton of investment tips which quickly made him richer than even the most successful patent could have. He doesn't come up with any theories about time travel, and doesn't work on building a device to put those theories to the test. He certainly doesn't travel back in time to give himself investment tips. It doesn't even occur to him that the mysterious stranger might have been himself.

Bob is a tinkerer and a failure. Though clearly intelligent, Bob can't maintain concentration enough to pursue his theories. His mental state is chaotic, and he struggles just to maintain any structure to his thoughts. He has been diagnosed with a few easily treatable mental conditions, but the medications have no effect - not even the negative effects normally associated with improperly prescribed medicine. He is disorganized, distracted, and gets lost in daydreams that he can't recall once he snaps out of them. His community dismisses him as a harmless eccentric, but has long since given up on trying to help him, since all their previous attempts have failed.

Bob doesn't exist. He is a grey screen, the in-between state of two conflicting realities. Theoretically, the universe would continue, safely oscillating between Robert and Robby, until such time that their quantum states were functionally indistinguishable - but Bob represents a fracture in the structure of time. A shadowy organization discretely monitors him, waiting for just the right moment to make their move, to draw him into their ranks.

The shape of time becomes twisted and strained, so naturally the Doctor soon lands in the middle of things. He now faces a dilemma: Does he undo the harm done by Robert, functionally killing Bob? Does he risk direct conflict with the Faction (certain whovians will know exactly who I'm talking about), putting Bob's entire community at risk? Or does he allow Bob to become an acolyte of time's saboteurs? ",0,1401548171,null,0,false,0,chvogjy,t3_26yebx,t1_chvogjy,t3_26yebx,null,1434033582,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

**Lambert** is a much better buy than some people let on, he's not a big useless target man and has shown himself to be more than capable of playing with pacey players around him. Could provide us with a very useful option off the bench and will allow us more room to rest Suarez/Sturridge. 


**Lallana** would be a perfect signing for what RB wants, price could be an issue but I can see it getting completed fairly soon with us trying to complete deals before the WC hits. Can play pretty much everywhere behind a striker, works hard, technically very good and again will allow us more room to rest and rotate in midfield.


**Lovren** again makes sense if we're expecting someone to be leaving. Can play either CB spot, suits our style and can prove to be more of a vocal player at the back. 


**Can** Replacement for Lucas or just a young prospect, either way he's shown his qualities and again is a versatile player.

true,winchyy,lfc68,,"*Agree with most of your points.
Just to add some more detail to your post, I've seen a fair amount of both Can and Moreno play at club level.*

Can is a good developing box to box midfielder. He likes to sit deep and orchestrate play, and then break forward at opportune times, inserting himself into the play well and with effect. 

We don't really have anyone like that at the moment. Gerrard is mostly sitting deep, while Henderson just runs everywhere, so he is mostly a mix of the two, which is why he has been compared with the likes of Yaya Toure and Patrick Viera in terms of his size and play style.

He can play anywhere up the spine, from behind the striker to in front of the back four, even filling in at centre-half on a few occasions, as well as at fullback if in dire straits.

His weaknesses seem to revolve around decision making and his second touch. 

His decisions are often rushed and made with a lack of vision, which isn't exactly beneficial in a holding midfield player. He escapes this by using his strength and passing range to reset play back to his centre halves, or occasionally bundle his way past opposition midfielders.

By his second touch I mean what he does when he gets the ball. He is very good at finding space and receiving the ball, and often uses his pace and power to set up a beneficial first touch. However, I believe his touch after that, when he either finds himself on the ball or reacting to his first touch is below par for a player of his calibre. 

He will often take the wrong touch or pass after receiving the ball, as if he is unaware of the space he has created for himself. His rushed passes can result in Leverkusen being counter attacked upon, which is something he has to watch in his game.

*Overall though in our system, I think he brings qualities that we could benefit from, and he would be an alternative to Stevie in between the 2 centre-halves. He's a buy, but at a max of 12m and soon, before Bayern become assholes*

Moreno is your typical Spanish fullback. He's quick, he's strong, and he bombs down the wing. Sometimes too often. Fullbacks are given lots of responsibility in Rodger's system, which means they are critical in both attack and defense. This is why their decision making needs to be immaculate, knowing when to bomb forward, and when to sit back.

Moreno has the ball skills of a winger, and his left foot will trouble most keepers in the EPL, but his defending needs to improve. With his natural ability, I see Rodgers helping him develop his game, and Moreno, still just 21, becoming a mainstay in the Liverpool team.

*He's worth the investment, because the return will be greater than it. 15-18m now is worth 10 years of a skilled, modern left-back.*",0,1401549974,null,0,false,0,chvp20s,t3_26y5ey,t1_chvp20s,t1_chvl46u,null,1434033869,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

Lambert is selfless and creative whilst being strong and gets the job done. He will also not upset the SAS ego by challenging their squad status, which is essential for us. Elsewhere, we currently have a first line of midfield in Gerrard and Lucas with Lucas probably being moved to 'Gerrard Cup edition' So we are looking for a long term option there. Supporting the current squads ego whilst building a future one. 2nd line of Midfield we have Allen and Henderson who work hard and create, this area could do with some help though, especially from a better finisher but is not essential right now. 3rd line, Sterling and Coutinho, Shaqirir and LLana would fit perfectly in here I think, and even if we don't get them our intent is clear to me and I'm proud to think we want to beat last seasons goal record.  

So defence, yes we need it to improve and a player like Lovren I believe will do that greatly, with a long term prospect left back helping out Enrique I think we have this covered for this window. Yes we will still let in a lot of goals as our new defenders learn together but if we improve our scoring alongside of this, the gap for GD will improve also.

I don't think they represent the ""CNR people"" lol, yet they do if I invent ""CNR people"" as a set of people with the shared ideology.

Most people who live in PUL areas think the ""Pradestant Coalition"" are retarded too. (99% of people)  And that any type of ""ethnic cleansing"" is wrong. Using ""PUL community"" as a description of a shared ideology is just wrong. 

People just happened to be born there, in whatever area.

true,ruven95,mcgann,McGann,"There is a new show and an old one, but the new show isn't a remake/ reboot, but furthers the story of the original. The BBC took the show off the air in the late 80s due bad ratings and tried to revive it with an American co-produced movie (which failed, sadly). The original show had stories lasting for about three to seven episodes (although there is one with just one episode and one with ten, but mostly three to seven) which were about twenty minutes each while the new show has story lasting two episodes at most, with each episode being nearly an hour long. The Doctor changes dies and renegenerates (-&gt; is played by a different actor) about every three seasons. Seven Doctors were in the original show, one in the tv-movie and (as of yet) three in the new show. I personally started my journey into Doctor Who with the beginning of the show and the Ninth Doctor. The first season has low production quality, because the BBC hadn't much hope for the show, but most of the writing is fairly good. They had more money for the next seasons. Other good points to jump on are the very first episode 'An Unearthly Child' (although the rest of the story isn't as great as the first episode), the first Third Doctor Story 'A Spearhead from Space', because it starts a more arc-based era of Doctor Who and the first episode with the Eleventh Doctor 'Eleventh Hour', which was the start of the Cracks-in-time-arc. My personal suggestion would be to start from the first episode of the new show 'Rose', watch through the new show completly and then cherry pick episodes of the classics. You can always ask me for suggestions. Many episodes of the new show call back to the classics, even run tandem with them at times. So it is likely that you ask ""I liked the episode XY of the new show a lot, which classic should I watch?"" and there would be something related in the old show.

This is such a huge problem in our political system. It's the exact same reason House of Lords reform got shelved and hasn't been touched since early Blair. Every body can agree that the House of Lords and drugs policy needs changing, and most of us can agree that almost any of the alternatives are better than the current but few are willing to support an alternative that isn't exactly what they want, even if it is preferable to the status quo. For instance, I'd rather get rid of the hereditaries in the HoL and keep the appointed members (but reform the appointments system slightly) but I still support Clegg on Lords reform even though he favours an elected House because an elected house is better than having the 90 odd stupid hereditaries. Likewise, those that think using drugs should still be punishable (rather than treatable) but that the current system doesn't work, don't support moves towards rehabilitation and care because it's not what they want, and those who want to move in the direction of decriminalisation/legalisation wont support better policing, even if it would lead to a better outcome.

I think of all the players we could target from Soton (with the exception of Shaw who is going to command a massive transfer fee as well as a massive wage especially with the likely bidding war between United and Chelsea) Lovren would be the most likely to fit a direct need, has upside and would fit perfectly into our back line.

I really like Rodriguez, he is a big effort player with a fair amount of skill and knows how to find the back of the net. He also is versatile enough that he can slide up to a striker role if needed and can pull a shift on either wing. The ACL injury is concerning if only because even if everything goes right he may not be truly fit until midseason. Even with  the advances in dealing with a ACL injury ligament damage is still the type of thing that can take a fair amount of time for a player to regain confidence in following the injury.....the bright side is that the injury would likely drive his pricetag down and would allow Levy and Spurs to put tons of clauses into the contracts where the transfer would carry limited risk to the club.

The other player i think would be worth a shout looking at would be Callum Chambers.....young (19 years old), English, and plays fullback.  Would serve as a nice backup for Walker on the right. At 19 he isn't at the stage in his career like Naughton where he needs or expects to start meaning we could let him grow while Walker controls the slot, his fee would be reasonable and he saw a fair amount of time under Poch.

If that's the case then why isn't this being looked at a higher level?

If we can have politicians revising laws on gay marriage etc. because it's becoming such an issue - why is road use still this matter of contention where cyclists and motorists knock-heads again and again (even though some people are both!). 

&gt;  we need to be getting single-occupant cars off the roads and encouraging cycling is an excellent way to accomplish this and tackle the societal health issues of our sedentary lifestyles.

That works in an ideal situation - but it doesn't work that way. Our world is expanding, not contracting. Superstores for shopping are sighted outside towns rather than in easy reach of every residential street... some people commute an hour or more by car or public transport just to reach their jobs. 

For some people, travelling *is* their jobs and then we have rising - almost prohibitively expensive - public transport costs. Then there's the fact that British weather is not consistently pleasant enough for cycling...

&gt; Getting car drivers to cycle regularly for just a week would go a long way to improving safety for cyclists; in respect to this I think the biggest improvement in safety would come from making EVERYONE do some cycling training. 

Would that stop current cyclists from riding in the blind spots of vehicles or trying to make manoeuvres from blind spots in the road? Would it stop them mounting pavements? 

I'm concerned that at some point you've got to consider the idea that some people really are just assholes - or stupid - or both. They could be drivers too, or just cyclists.

I don't think they would.

I know a few people at work who are pretty hardcore Tory supporters but still favour decriminalisation over criminalisation for weed.

I think the topic has superceded the typical political lines and tends to be more defined by exposure. People who know someone or they themselves smoke tend to favour legalisation or decrim. Those that have never been exposed, or the only exposure has been negative tend not to like the idea.

Hell; I just got my hair cut after having a smoke this morning and the barber commented on it and admitted to being a smoker as well. He was easily in his 40s and didn't seem the type to smoke. 

It's becoming such a joke law that no one seemingly cares as much anymore. Those that want to smoke, do. The Police are well aware of this and in some places to such an extent that they will only confiscate what you have on you and not even issue cautions.

Actually it is.

If he was considering implementing a policy into the UK as his role as Prime Minister, he should arguably just do what's best for the country regardless of public opinion (though of course there are plenty of arguments against that attitude too).

However, he's considering this for inclusion in his party's manifesto, in which case his job is to make sure his party gets elected as Party Leader. It would be like insisting that a CEO doesn't try an maximise profits of their company, or the head of a Charity doesn't try to maximise the donations they receive.

Yeah keeping it in the franchise requirement is a good idea. Good to hear it will be retained.

&gt; I believe First has even committed to a refurbishment of the Night Riviera + some new carriages to extend the service a bit. I have never done the sleeper, and I have an enormous excuse to (I commute to/from Reading once a week) but don't know if I should wait for the refurbishment before giving it a go.

From the pictures I've seen of the sleepers, they don't seem too bad now really. Better than the Caledonian stock I would say. Not sure where they would get new stock from though. I suppose they could always find some spare Mark 3 sleepers around - and preserved railways were given lots of them by BR in the 1980s...

Yeah. Take the engine out though and I think the basic carriage design is pretty good.

No, they closed their plant in Birmingham after the Pendolinos and 180s were built.

That might be true for you, but, not for some others. Some people don't want to get caught by law enforcement doing an illegal act, I know I wouldn't. It may not deter everyone, but it will deter some. 

&gt; To clarify, I'm not talking about the principle of the law acting as a deterrent, only specifically when applied to drugs.

Why would drugs be any different from anything else enforced by the law?

&gt; It's not exactly the same thing as legalizing, but Portugal decriminalized posession of ""small"" amounts of drugs[1] a few years ago, and that seems to have gone better than you might expect.

You're confusing deterrence with treatment. In Britain weed has essentially been decriminalised. It's real easy to get, if Police catch you with it they give you a cannabis warning, no criminal record. That's not a deterrent. Since the Misuse of Drugs Act from 1971, which brought about these incredibly liberal legal changes, cannabis use in this country has sky rocketed.

I'm not as opposed to the Lord Spiritual as I am to the hereditaries, but I still think that giving an organisation, especially a religious one, is a bad road. If people want religious representation in Parliament, then they can vote for a religious party. As it stands there are no national religious parties, because nobody wants them. If nobody wants religious representation, then surely we should remove religious representation from the HoL, not increase it. 

Additionally, religious representation is just one additional kind of repesentation. If we accepted the Lords Spiritual (along with other spiritual lords, or perhaps put them in the commons instead) then we should provide other forms of representation as well, such as allowing members of the British Medical Association (which represents most doctors), the Farmers Union, the National Union of Teachers, or maybe even the Trades Union Congress and the Confederation of British Industry (representing employers and companies). 

Personally I don't see anything inherently wrong with this sort of representation, but I think that it would require *huge* amounts of change in our system and would be *very* difficult to get right.

It sounds like you'll also be in quite a unique environment, because the holiday park is essentially a self contained area, you're only really competing with the other takeaways.

There has never been any concrete evidence that it can greatly harm someone and it's hypocritical to suggest that it should be illegal on these grounds when the government taxes and allows the sale of cigarettes and alcohol: the two things that are well known to cause some of the nation's biggest killers, such as cancer, obesity and heart disease. Nobody has ever died or overdosed from it. You could argue that people with mental health issues could have their conditions made worse by it, but this is also true of many other drugs. 

In fact, Prof David Nutt (the guy who the government hired to do some research and then fired when they didn't like the evidence he gave them suggesting that weed should be legalized) did some research and found, in terms of damage to society, alcohol was at number one above heroin:

Having said that selling it and taxing it would bring in BILLIONS to the UK treasury. We are wasting/losing tons of money chasing, arresting and putting people in prison over it, as well as not selling and taxing it. Vice Magazine did some mathematics and came up with this:

http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/this-is-how-much-the-uk-would-actually-make-if-it-taxed-cannabis

Legalizing and moderating it would take away power from criminals and criminal gangs, who use it as a massive source of income, especially since they can jack up the price given the illegality of it.

Now on to the medicinal benefits: weed is a very effective painkiller and it's a tragedy it isn't allowed to be prescribed on the NHS. Watch a guy with MS tell you about how greatly it aids him through his suffering:

On a more personal level, my dad has terrible back-pain because the tissue in his spine has withered away and the bones are grinding together. He has been waiting for years on the NHS for doctors to operate as they're going through a list of other treatments that don't seem to be working. They don't want to operate on him as it is risky and could paralyse him, which we're past caring about anymore because the pain he experiences makes him pretty much like that anyway. He uses weed to help him through the days and you can see the amazing effect it has on him as he's actually able to function.

Given what I've said, I think it would be massively beneficial for society to have it legalized. The only reason I see for it not being so is that the government would get eviscerated by right-wing press and voters, who cling on to reactionary stances against it.",0,1401558284,null,0,false,0,chvs3se,t3_26y4ea,t1_chvs3se,t1_chvqcuk,null,1434035300,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

true,crucible,null,null,"&gt; It's a shambles that even London to Bristol was forgotten about until 2013/4. I wonder if BR would have done it in the 90s had they not been privatised and not run on minimal investment prior to that?

I suspect the answer to that is tied up in the failure of the APT decades ago. There were plans for lots of electrification as APT was introduced. When it failed, the HST was good enough so that really gave BR no reason to push on with electrification plans.

&gt; We should really be at the point where it's places like Cornwall on the radar for electrification, not major cities.

Agree entirely with that - other countries would have had routes like London - Bristol and London - Sheffield wired decades ago.

&gt; I guess to do Bristol to Exeter you'd reasonably have to do Exeter to Reading via Westbury/Newbury too otherwise you'd lose the more direct route under normal conditions and then be reliant on a single line. Not always the best idea as we have found out this year..

Hopefully NR will take heed of this year's disruptions and plan works like that if Exeter ever gets wired.

&gt; I can imagine that if Exeter was ever done, Plymouth wouldn't find it trivial to get the government to extend it there too, compared to the relative ease that the Welsh Assembly seemed to get it extended to Swansea with relatively little whining. It really should be Plymouth minimum, Penzance ideally (you're going to need to do it eventually, so why not do it all now, and it avoids a need for bi-mode trains or keeping a fleet of stodgy old HSTs just for Cornwall)

Hopefully they will be included in future electrification schemes. Swansea was never really planned until the Valley Lines were scheduled for electrification - another case of the Welsh Government's seeming obsession with improving Cardiff at the expense of the rest of the nation.

The DfT are obsessed with bi-mode trains because they thought that coupling a Class 57 to a Pendolino was the model for all diesel haulage of electric trains. The fact Virgin were running trains between Crewe and Holyhead using what was essentially Heath Robinson style emergency coupling equipment seems to have escaped the DfT. In reality modern stock like an IEP and a Class 68 would both have something like a Dellner coupling making this much easier.

&gt;  I think that we shouldn't be using the commercial railway as an operating rail museum. If a few people still want old signalling, then let them take the bits away and use it on the heritage/volunteer railways. I totally agree, there's no excuse why the entire country isn't on it. But we see the same old places being resignalled time and time again while places like Cornwall get overlooked. Cornwall is a bit of an odd case anyway, you have ancient mechanical signalling bounded by islands of solid state interlocking (the former area served by Bodmin signal box, now controlled by a panel in Lostwithiel). If GSM-R wasn't forced on the South of England by international agreement we'd probably be waiting decades for that too.

I could understand leaving branch lines on mechanical signalling but there is no reason for having main lines still signalled using mecahnical signalling. It does show the lack of investment in the SW over the years.

I think the spread of GSM-R is partly down to it being a 'new' technology too. Much better to roll that out than replace some signals yet again. OK, there is an agreement to have the South of the UK done by a certain date - I think the area to be covered initially was everywhere south of a line drawn from The Wash to the Severn Estuary.

&gt; Having a devolved government probably helps enormously too. It's fine to put signallers out of work in SW England unless they want to move to Oxfordshire, but not in Cardiff apparently.

It seems that way. I do think the Welsh Government are too focused on Cardiff at times.

&gt; Agreed. Bristol isn't really local for people down here. I just picked Taunton because IIRC it's the where Exeter ends and Westbury takes over.

Taunton would certainly be more local for Devon / Cornwall.

&gt; It'd be nice to know how NR decide these things. Surely if you're going to go to the trouble to build a centre in Wales, and the technology doesn't really have a distance limit anymore, you might as well have the whole of Wales being run from it? They can seemingly do Penzance to Paddington from one place.

true,Memoriae,null,null,"Real estate as in housing, or land? Freehold or leasehold?

If you're talking about buying and selling freehold houses, which are probably most of them, then it's pretty simple.

Buyer looks for a house that they want, and puts in an offer to the estate agent, who then passes that on to the seller. Offer gets accepted, and surveys etc happen. If the survey comes back fine, then it moves to enquiries, where your conveyancer speaks to the sellers, and they basically answer any questions that you have, or anyone in the process has (Mine had about 30 enquiries, only 10 of them were questions that I'd asked, the others were all technicalities that needed correcting).  
Once all the enquiries are sorted, you then have exchange of contracts, where the buyer signs their part of the paperwork and the seller signs theres. Contracts are then exchanged, and the sale is then binding.

Completion happens afterwards, where the buyer gets the keys to their new house, and the seller gets a fat stack of money.

In terms of fees, the buy doesn't really pay a huge amount, but there are a lot of little fees. Mine had a product fee, homebuyer's report fee (basically an enhanced survey that highlights a *lot* of things), solicitors fees and that's basically it. Came to a grand or so (my wife works for the solicitors representing us, so we paid cost for the searches). If you buy something over £250k, you also have to pay stamp duty, which is a tax on property sales. Mine was £110k, so doesn't have anything else.  
The seller will end up paying commission to the estate agent, usually 2-3%, which comes out of their asking price. So in my case, the seller basically paid the estate agent about £3k in commission. They'll also have any redemption fees on their mortgage (unless they paid in full already).

Generally speaking, buyers and sellers never actually speak at length, although we did with ours, because the estate agents are fucking useless, and never bothered sending anyone for the 2nd viewing that we booked. Had a good old natter with them, and they basically answered all the questions we had, and cleared up loads of stuff from the homebuyer's report too.",0,1401558460,null,0,false,0,chvs693,t3_26yvp2,t1_chvs693,t3_26yvp2,null,1434035333,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

I'd also like to have a choice of what I smoke.  Sure our weed is strong over here, but high levels of THC are what cause problems with most people.  Should it be legal it'd be nice to be able to choose something with less THC and more of the other cannaboids.  Plus I'm sick of paying £20 for 2g of the stuff from shady dealers.

There's also the health of current users to consider.  It's been known that some of the worst dealers are happy to spray buds with silicone or sand just to get the weight up a little bit, or not flush out the chemicals used during growing, just to get the current crop out quickly.

There's a whole industry around cannabis waiting to explode and generate money, with very little negative issues. I think we should let that happen.

Otherwise we're still left with millions of people using it anyway and loads of people making plenty of untaxed money.  People around the world love weed, we've always smoked it and I can't see that changing in the future.",0,1401558720,null,0,false,0,chvs9uf,t3_26y4ea,t1_chvs9uf,t1_chvqcuk,null,1434035379,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

I don't believe that, the law makes possession and usage of drugs illegal, not treatment. Also, if addicts are worried about revealing that they're addicts, in the case that they relapse and the law knows where to look for a drug abuser, then anonymous groups can be founded to help them, like Alcoholics Anonymous.

&gt; It moves the drugs that people are taking anyway into a black market where they can get all sorts of contaminated.

Good, further deterrent not to use drugs.

&gt; You might say people shouldn't use drugs, but I don't think it's morally correct for the law to encourage that system.

I think it does now, but wouldn't if it were tougher.

&gt; Drugs are different from law enforcement in general because by its very nature it's a medical issue.

People are killed by idiots behind the wheel, while they're driving. Of course it's a medical issue.

&gt;As for your last paragraph, cannabis use may be up but I was trying to address your point about legalizing all drugs. 

And I was replying to your point about legalizing all drugs. I was giving you an example of a more liberal drug law that has undoubtedly failed. Only an idiot makes the same mistake twice. 

&gt; I don't believe that it's right in principle to have laws with the intention of deterring the use of soft drugs. That's a freedoms issue.

It's not a freedom issue, it's a societal issue. Weed is addictive, can cause psychosis, schizophrenia, and depending on your chosen method of consumption - smoking - can cause cancers of various kinds. Just because a bunch of idiot stoners want to be able to buy weed more easily is not a good reason to legalise weed. It's selfish and hedonistic on their parts.

But anyway the reason why the nuclear policy bothers me more than it should is that they don't really give any good reason to dismiss it, and just make it sound that everything about it is bad, which makes the decision seem really ignorant and probably based off of a couple peoples personal feelings. They just seem closed minded on the matter and they could do the same with other policies.
___
Here's the 3 reasons they list. 
&gt;""1. Nuclear power will not help meet our short-term carbon reduction targets to prevent the risk of runaway climate change.""  
• In the UK, nuclear power provides less than 4% of our energy.  
• We don't run our cars on nuclear power, and we don't heat our homes with nuclear power. And housing (27%) and transport (21%) comprise 48% of the UK's total carbon emissions.

If it generates power then of course it would help. They then say how it only provides 4% of power like thats a reason to not use it, that just means we don't use it much. We don't use solar power that much but if we could install solar on every house in the country for £10 we wouldn't say no because solar isn't currently used. They then say we don't run our cars on nuclear or heat our homes on it, i could say ""we don't run our cars on wind/solar or don't heat our homes with wind"".. but anyway we can power cars with nuclear(electric cars) and the percentage of cars sold that are electric by 2030 would probably be close to 100% anyway. Also nuclear does power homes and will heat homes with electric boilers.

&gt; 2. Nuclear power carries inherent risks, and is particularly vulnerable to the potentially deadly combination of human error, design failure, and natural disaster.

Any energy source has these, and i don't think natural disasters are something we should be worried about in the UK, they could be accounted for anyway. [Also more  people apparently die from people falling while installing house roof solar panels](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/) than nuclear, that's how safe nuclear is as an energy source if it's being compared to a solar panel.

&gt;3) Investing in nuclear power will deter investments in renewable energy.

There has been talks of even classing Nuclear as ""renewable"", i bet that would blow the Green parties mind. Nuclear is definitely ""sustainable"" which is almost the same thing, [we can apparently have enough resources to keep nuclear going until after the Earth gets destroyed by the sun](http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2012/ph241/chowdhury2/)(which is why it might be classed as ""renewable""), so i'm pretty sure we can rely on it until we no longer need it at all.

Good for you. How are government going to tax people who are growing it? If gov taxes their weed, dealers can provide it cheaper. According to your logic, they will lace it which should be prevented. You think dealers are gonna turn down an opportunity to make some money cause you prefer to buy booze at a supermarket? Ludicrous.

Not true. Weed is addictive, can cause psychosis, schizophrenia, and depending on your chosen method of consumption - smoking - can cause cancers of various kinds. The alcohol argument is so stupid. ""This dangerous substance is less dangerous than this dangerous legal substance... It should be legal too."" Alcohol is too ingrained in our culture to be criminalised now. Let's not make the same mistake by legalizing weed.

1) The ties of doctors are far more likely to carry pathogenic bacteria than the ties of staff in a non-clinical role.

2) Wearing a wrist watch is associated with a higher bacteria count on the wrist but not the hand

3) Where the wrist watch is manipulated, an increased hand bacteria count results, relative to non wristwatch wearers

The last point is interesting, as having a watch is useful on the wards, for both clinical examination and personal timekeeping. What most people with a watch do when on the wards is remove the wristwatch and put it on to their belts, or have a fob watch. However, this means that everytime the watch needs to be used it has to be touched, to angle the watchface to allow it to be seen. Therefore, if it is largely the touching of the watch that is the problem, has the no wristwatches policy actually helped at all?

I've never said I don't care about the consequences but in regards to the debate on legalisation of weed once you take out the potential damage caused by inhalation what consequences are you talking about? Once you take drugs out of the hands of criminals the only damage is to the user, and in the case of cannabis I see this to be very low.

&gt; Good for you. How are government going to tax people who are growing it? If gov taxes their weed, dealers can provide it cheaper. According to your logic, they will lace it which should be prevented. You think dealers are gonna turn down an opportunity to make some money cause you prefer to buy booze at a supermarket? Ludicrous.

Although I don't know the economics of produce and taxation I'd imagine it would work the same way as taxing any other product. Surely you'd have to be a registered grower, therefore paying tax? Look at America, you'll see that the majority of people will rather pay slightly more to not have to buy it illegally. Also if legal supplies undercut dealers you remove this problem.

&gt; Not true. Weed is addictive, can cause psychosis, schizophrenia, and depending on your chosen method of consumption - smoking - can cause cancers of various kinds. The alcohol argument is so stupid. ""This dangerous substance is less dangerous than this dangerous legal substance... It should be legal too."" Alcohol is too ingrained in our culture to be criminalised now. Let's not make the same mistake by legalizing weed.

Weed is not addictive in the same way that say meth is. You can become depended on it yes because you like the way it make you feel, but that's the same for almost anything. Your body does not however develop a need for it as is seen in addiction. The issue of psychosis and schizophrenia exists in people with a predisposition to these problems, the majority of people tend not to experience them.

&gt; Yeah, so it's dangerous and should be banned. How can you be this obtuse. You can't trust people to make good decisions for themselves, people are idiots and need to be guided into making the correct decisions.

When I said substance abuse kills people I was referring to hard drugs. You cannot die from cannabis use nor other drugs such as LSD or mushrooms. Weed is, by no measure dangerous, hell it's used to treat forms of cancer, surely that can only be a good thing? Plus if you use a vaporizer you remove that smoke damage aspect.

I don't think people are idiots as you say.

I've already explained why this would not have to be the case. 

&gt; Do you not find the judgement that contamination and unreliable dosage is a good thing because it serves to deter a small number of people, kind of chilling?

Dealers aren't going to kill off their customers. If you don't want to risk getting your drugs laced don't buy drugs. Making the law tougher would reduce the number of people buying drugs. 

&gt; And it would be just as wrong.

Not if it worked, which it will.

It doesn't matter what you want to call it. Both these laws should be put in place to protect people.

Yes it does.

&gt; although there are people with mental health problems who use it.

Further reason to make it illegal.

&gt; And so far I haven't given making it easier to acquire as a good reason to legalize cannabis.

&gt; since soft drugs should obviously be legal.

true,whole_scottish_milk,null,null,"&gt; A helmet protects you from DYING

Oh, I forgot heads were so fragile that the slightest nudge results in immediate death. You are speaking as though hitting your head on the pavement *will* kill you. It won't, unless you happen to hit the pavement in a very specific and unlikely manner. I have more chance of being stabbed to death in my city than falling off my bike hard enough to kill me, should I wear a stab vest when I go out?

&gt; Hitting your elbow or knee is going to break some bones.

It's unlikely that you will break anything from simply falling off a bike, however, assuming it was easy to break bones, that isn't reason enough to wear them? I thought that was one of the main reasons people wore helmets, to avoid injury to the head.

&gt; Breaking your skull causes death.

No it doesn't actually. Sudden impact causes death, if you're going fast enough to die from impact, an inch or so of polystyrene isn't going to save you. The skull is incredibly tough, if you are going fast enough to break the skull upon impact, you are going fast enough for the helmet to be obsolete.

&gt; You lack the basic education and understanding of physics

Coming from the man who thinks an overpriced inch of polystyrene covering 30% of their head is the deciding factor in life or death in accidents.

&gt;  you cannot see the reason for wearing a helmet.

No, I see the reason, I just find the farce that are bicycle helmets absolutely pointless, there is no neck support, no face protection, they are incredibly weak to the point that any collision over 30mph means they are doing nothing but adding weight. If you are concerned about safety, wear a full face helmet with knee pads and elbow pads, otherwise it's just going through the motions because it's what you have been told is the right thing to do.

&gt; Obviously it doesn't protect you from all eventualities but it sure is better than nothing.

It doesn't really protect you from any eventualities other than falling off a bike at low speed and landing directly on your head, which is very unlikely to happen. So, like the stab vest, the helmet stays home when I go out on my bike.",0,1401562283,null,0,false,0,chvtn79,t3_26xwka,t1_chvtn79,t1_chvt7ci,null,1434036089,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

They're right there, in the bit of my last post you just quoted. 

&gt; Surely you'd have to be a registered grower, therefore paying tax? Look at America, you'll see that the majority of people will rather pay slightly more to not have to buy it illegally. Also if legal supplies undercut dealers you remove this problem.

What happens to those massive profits gov makes on tax if you're undercutting dealers? Also, you middle class liberals might be able to afford buying your favourite breed of Purple Kush from your legal supplier. But, working class people, who legalisation would really hit, would be forced, out of poverty, to look for cheaper deals from their dealers. 

&gt;Weed is not addictive in the same way that say meth is. You can become depended on it yes because you like the way it make you feel, but that's the same for almost anything.

Weed may be less addictive than meth but still addictive. Arguing that something is less worse than meth isn't going to sway me either.

&gt; The issue of psychosis and schizophrenia exists in people with a predisposition to these problems, the majority of people tend not to experience them.

That's not true. And if it were, people who are predisposed may not know, may not care, etc... We should prevent them from taking weed. ""Ohh it's ok cause most of us will be fine.""

&gt; When I said substance abuse kills people I was referring to hard drugs.

I thought you wanted to legalise those. 

&gt;  You cannot die from cannabis use nor other drugs such as LSD or mushrooms.

People have died from bad trips. These drugs damage in other ways than just killing people. 

&gt; Weed is, by no measure dangerous, hell it's used to treat forms of cancer, surely that can only be a good thing?

First of all that's not true. And, if it were. Then it would stand to reason that radioactive isotopes are also not dangerous, they're also used to treat cancer.

No, you commented on the laws.

""You do not have an automatic right to a passport. They can be refused or withdrawn.""

At no point in your original comment did you imply that you were referring to this one specific story. You only decided to go along with this story when you realised you had an angle to make up an argument from. One which I wasn't even arguing against to begin with, no less.

&gt; Not that obvious to me. I'll be convinced when you stop trying to stick up for the travel rights of convicted violent criminals who are being affected by a sensible and proportionate action.

Well of course you would say that, otherwise it would become obvious that you are pulling this argument out of your arse by nitpicking.

&gt; The actions of the government with regard to preventing violent citizens travelling abroad to cause more trouble is not invasive or authoritarian. You don't need any help from me in painting your opinions in any light.

Nice how you have absolute trust in government to decide who is a ""violent citizen"" (nothing mentioned about ""violent criminals"" in your original comment). Our government isn't notoriously incompetent or anything and I totally can't see this power ever being abused.

I think the government having the power to deny someone the right to travel elsewhere in the world is authoritarian. Do you think it is not authoritarian for a government to have the power to refuse travel?

Whether these hooligans have committed crimes in Britain or not, it is not the job of the UK government to police Brazilian streets or football matches either. Besides this, it is authoritarian to assume all those with a history of hooliganism are guilty of intending to go to a match and/or cause trouble before they have even got on the plane. Furthermore, essentially banning all travel outside the UK for these ""criminals"" is extremely excessive when the claim is that they want to prevent trouble in one country, it's akin banning metal to solve Glasgow's knife problem.

A Study In Scarlet: the first Sherlock Holmes book. I did get slightly irritated by his seemingly patronising manner for a brief period, but it really re-captured my attention in the second half of the book (when they go back to the States and we hear the origins and background of the killer). So, eventually I was pleased. Will read the next Sherlock soon.

American Psycho: nah. Never again. Nasty, nasty book. Have no interest whatsoever in reading his other work as a result. 

The Importance of Being Earnest: short, well-written, entertaining. More like this please.

Animal Farm: re-visiting an old classic, it's a classic for a reason, read it shortly after re-reading 1984, there are several joint themes between the books. 

Maids of Misfortune: was advertised as a murder-mystery, was 50% love story. Was not pleased. 

Revenge Wears Prada: meh. Passable. Too much bitchery and not enough fashion. 

Perfume: The Story Of A Murderer. After re-watching the film of the same title which is absolutely excellent. The book has a good 50 pages of outright weirdness, but pulls it all together with a good ending, and I did enjoy it despite the weirdness. 

1984: yep, still great. 

Currently reading: Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil after watching a film on NetFlix about the woman who wrote the book. It caused a big hoo-ha because she was accused of inferring that the Jews were partially responsible for their own WWII deaths. Haven't read enough of it to comment yet.

I think also people tend to forget that this was Negredo's first season without a 3 week winter break, and we didn't have the opportunity to rest him due to Jovetic and Aguero's injuries. If you look at other La liga imports into the league (Ozil for example) they all dropped off in form and/or got rested, and many of them didn't play as much as Negredo up to christmas.

He was incredible in the first half though, although I have to disagree with you about next season. I think, given his summer off, he will be number 1  at the beginning, possibly with Jovetic as we rest Aguero and Dzeko, who will have had the world cup and miss a lot of pre-season.

Especially now Navas is out, because his partnership with Negredo is fantastic and Silva will need a rest too.

Looking forward to his next season though, hopefully he'll score more in the league and at home.",0,1401564730,null,0,false,0,chvukyq,t3_26yrq3,t1_chvukyq,t3_26yrq3,null,1434036531,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3

Thirty One Nil, a book by James Montague where he is on the road with Football's outsiders as they attempt to qualify for the 2014 World Cup, really interesting so far.

Football Against the Enemy, by Simon Kuper, the book explores the effect football has on countries, it's from the the 90s though but still a very interesting read.

The Spanish Civil War by Paul Preston, like Ronseal does what it says on the tin. 

Finished recently:

La Roja by Jimmy Burns, the book explores how Spanish Football has evolved from isolation to winning everything.

Soccernomics by Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski, the facts and figures of Football, especially why England lose on penalties!

El Clasico by Richard Fitzpatrick, the Real Madrid vs Barcelona rivalry, it's origins and it's history.

true,kvural,tardis,TARDIS,"This is well-trodden ground in Doctor Who discussions, but let's see if I can't put my own spin on it:

People in discussing a female Doctor tend to focus a lot on the business of casting. This has always bemused me to a certain extent. I mean, these people are *actors*. They've trained their whole careers to sell their characters to an audience, whether that character is a cashier or a frickin' potted plant. If a woman were cast as the Doctor, the people in charge would bend over backwards to make damn sure whoever they picked could pull off their vision. Bear in mind that this is a major entertainment franchise, a great cash cow for the BBC and a cultural institution with a lot of investment in its continuing success.

So I think it's pretty much granted that if a woman were cast as the Doctor she'd have the ability to portray her character well. I mean, Jesus, the character's literally the centerpiece of the mythos and the person who is going to be basically monopolizing our attention episode after episode. They've never cast a dud as the Doctor and they never will, because so much rides on these kinds of decisions.

The issue really is: would the writing serve a female Doctor well?

I got into a fairly heated argument with my girlfriend the other day on this topic. She said she would be OK with a female Doctor as long as the companion isn't also female, because this would lead to one of two scenarios:

a) They'll end up talking about shopping, which she doesn't want to see on Doctor Who.
b) They'll never end up talking about shopping, which will be unrealistic.

I found this argument fairly rubbish and hopefully you do too - but it points a little bit to an issue with our skewed notions of realism when it comes to gender. Women in mainstream entertainment terms are often classed as ""men+gimmick"", which you see pretty often in stories revolving around groups of people where each character has a distinguishing trait, one of them being ""woman"".

If the show cast a female Doctor, it would come across as cheap and horrible if it submerged itself in lady jokes (""oh wow I've got bouncy things on my chest"", ""I never realized how sexy the Master looked"", etc.), but it would also come across as clueless if it intentionally avoided the subject of the Doctor's gender change altogether. Once we become accustomed to a female Doctor this would be less of an issue, but the hurdle is there.

The writing for a female Doctor would need to be very careful in striking a balance between the two. That's a much bigger issue than the simple ""can a woman portray the Doctor?"" brouhaha.

But here's the thing:

The balance I referred to above may well not exist. It may be the case that the show cannot juggle these two factors well enough to keep a decent fanbase as well as level of quality. I like to think it can be done, but maybe it can't.

But.

But.

If it happens - if we get a female Doctor - even if it doesn't work out as well as it should...even if people scoff at it or the writing isn't as artful as it should have been...the reality will be there: the Doctor has been and can be female. Every time it's brought up again it'll seem less ridiculous. And the scenario of a female Doctor will have an easier time of walking the line between naivete and cheap humor.

And at some point, I think and hope, we'll catch ourselves wondering why we made such a fuss about that time they first had a female Doctor, when that character blazed a trail for the great stuff which succeeded her introduction. In much the same way that we can look back on the days of Troughton and Pertwee, and chuckle at the fear in those times that Doctor Who could never survive such radical reinventions - shaky reinventions which occasionally stumbled, but which paved the way for the great mythologies yet to come.

So I say, trust the casting - but look to the scripts. That's where the real battle for the success of a female Doctor will take place.",0,1401568972,null,0,false,0,chvw83b,t3_26z5oj,t1_chvw83b,t3_26z5oj,null,1434037306,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

true,colcob,null,null,"That one study about how close people drive past cyclists depending on whether they're wearing a helmet is interesting but it is a) ONE study, and b) shows no causal link, correlation or probabilistic analysis of the relationship between how close a car is when it passes you and the risk of a collision or accident causing head injury.

It's classic faulty reasoning that misses out a whole step in the evidence chain. 

So if we accept that wearing a helmet causes a small differential in the average spacing between cyclist and car when passing, that's fine.  But the next step is not just to say 'well that *could* increase the chances of an accident so it's not worth wearing a helmet. Fucking hell, that's not science.

The next question is to say, ok well does a small reduction in the average spacing between car and cyclist *actually* cause any increase in the accident rate.  After all, provided there is *some* non-zero spacing between car and cyclist, they haven't actually collided. 

The next question is to ask, using the largest possible statistical set of accident data, what is the percentage of cycle accident resulting in head injury that were caused by a car passing a cyclist too closely or making contact while passing (I would speculate that it is not a majority, accidents at junctions are more likely) and how many of them could have been avoided or mitigated by the car being a few cm further away.

The next question to ask is, of those accident caused by a car passing too closely or making contact when passing, and resulting in head injury, how many of those head injuries were in the range of impacts that would have successfully been mitigated by a cycle helmet.

Then and only then will you have sufficient data to make an educated guess as to whether or not a cycle helmet will statistically reduce or increase your probability of suffering a serious head injury.

Just to put into context the muslim population of England is half the population of Scotland. 

I'm strongly opposed to multiculturalism as it's socially divisive and leads to segregation, go to any major English city including London and you'll see, when you have all these beliefs together they're bound to cross one another and the results are ugly, we can be a nation of multi cultures but I'm afraid multiculturalism itself won't work, we all need have one law to follow, get rid of these sharia courts that we have would be a start.

Anyway rant aside, there's nothing wrong with being proud from where you are as long as it doesn't degenerate into xenophobic nationalistic stupidity like you see on /r/scotland.

2 players in each position with a youngster capable of making the step up is the perfect balance. Centre-back being a position where we can always do with that little bit more. To clarify some of my points:

* Agger and Lucas sold would be because we bring in a replacement and could stand to make a profit and improvement. It is with a heavy heart though as I think they are really loyal servants, complete Liverpool legends. 

* Would like Johnson to be sold but it is clear he won't be. Another loan out for Wisdom with a season of Flanagan as first choice RB will mean when Johnson leaves at the end of his contract (if he doesn't earn a new one) we won't have to scramble around for a replacement as we will have two capable and experienced players in the position.

* Paez really did impress against Shamrock Rovers. Think he will be on the very outskirts of the team next season. Ilori would do well to get another season out on loan so he can come back and slot right into the hold left by Toure.

* I expect to see Brannagan on the very outskirts of the team this season. Especially since Barca are sniffing around him and might try and woo him away.

*Suso and Alberto need more time out on loan.

*Would keep Borini regardless of the amount offered by Sunderland. Yesil will hopefully return from his second bad injury and can start to progress from where he was a year and a half ago.

true,KingMishka,eng-somerset,Somerset,"&gt;What happens to those massive profits gov makes on tax if you're undercutting dealers? Also, you middle class liberals might be able to afford buying your favourite breed of Purple Kush from your legal supplier. But, working class people, who legalisation would really hit, would be forced, out of poverty, to look for cheaper deals from their dealers.

I don't claim to know all the working of market economics regarding this, but if you look at the situation in Colorado it seems to be working just fine. Yes people may still go to dealers, in the same way people import cheap cigarettes, no system is perfect.

&gt; Weed may be less addictive than meth but still addictive. Arguing that something is less worse than meth isn't going to sway me either.

No, that's not what I'm saying. Weed literally is not addictive in the sense that your body doesn't develop a dependence. It's not that it's less bad than meth it's that it doesn't affect you in remotely the same way.

&gt;That's not true. And if it were, people who are predisposed may not know, may not care, etc... We should prevent them from taking weed. ""Ohh it's ok cause most of us will be fine.

I'd be interested to see any sources that support that. Everything I've seen regarding cannabis and mental illness have suggested it occurs in those with a predisposition or through extremely heavy use. As for the thing of people not knowing or caring that's a problem with the person. I wouldn't recommend someone trying anything without doing proper research into what it is they're taking and how it will affect them so they can decide if it's right for them.

&gt; I thought you wanted to legalise those.

Yes but I said substance ABUSE kills. You aren't going to die from a small amount of MDMA if it's pure and you're sensible with it. What will kill you is if it's mixed with something else or you take too much. I believe the problems caused through the legalisation of drugs would be much less than those that they cause through being illegal.

&gt; People have died from bad trips. These drugs damage in other ways than just killing people.

They have, but not directly as a result of the drug. Their actions while high yes maybe. However people die from drinking too much, people die driving to work. If someone takes a dose of acid relative to their tolerance, is in a good place mentally and has a trip sitter they'll most likely have a great experience. You can have bad trips but there are things that can be done to reduce the chances and I feel the benefits which can come from them outweigh the risk.

&gt; First of all that's not true. And, if it were. Then it would stand to reason that radioactive isotopes are also not dangerous, they're also used to treat cancer.

Sorry what's not true, that weed isn't dangerous or that it can't be used to help cancer sufferers? The comparison to radioactive isotopes is ridiculous. Yes they both happen to work as a treatement for the same disease, that doesn't mean they are in any way alike. One will straight up kill you through exposure while the other won't.

&gt; I think that's incredibly naive.

I really don't see how educating people on the effects, risks and potential benefits of something and allowing them to make their own choices with their bodies is naive. I'd much rather that than a system that criminalizes people for something which only affects themselves.

Krupnik - A traditional Polish honey vodka that's been brewed for hundreds of years. Actually, technically it's not vodka but a nalewka, not to be confused with liquer as the former is aged.

Żubrówka - Often what most people think of when I mention Polish vodka. It's vodka that's flavoured with bison grass, pretty good after a meal.

Wódka Żołądkowa Gorzka - Fruit/Herb flavoured vodka, my mates have all liked it. It's almost slightly sweet.

Wiśniówka - Cherry vodka, a little thicker than regular vodka. Not much more to say about that.

Now those are the flavoured vodkas that Poland is quite famous for, but there are many brands is you want good, basic vodka:

Pan Tadeusz - My favorite, unflavoured rye vodka with a decent kick.

Sobieski - Another great rye vodka, endoresed by Bruce Willis although I doubt he drinks it because he's too pussy.

Wyborowa - *The* first international vodka brand. It's name translates to ""Excellent"" so what's not to like.

Konik's Tail - A konik was a primitive type of horse that guaranteed a good harvest should you see it. I honestly doubt you'll see this in a Polish shop since it's a small batch vodka but my God is it worth it should you get hold of some.

There's obviously much more choice such as Belvedere and the like when it comes to Polish vodka and it's honestly just a case of finding your favorite as with anything. 

Word to the wise though, they're often less filtered than most of the domestic/big brand stuff you can get here. To drink it properly stick it in the freezer an hour before along with the shot glasses, buy some cold cuts from the deli counter and arrange in a platter. You then have the shot, a sip of a soft drink/juice and some meat, as soon as you finish one you fetch another bottle (who buys only one bottle?). 

For optimal enjoyment raise your voice by at least 15 Db, develop a martyr complex and argue with friends without ever compromising on your position.

How do cheap FWD cars handle when you throw them into a corner at 40/50/60 etc.  Learn what it feels like to get into a slide and learn how to correct that mistake.

In fact, as I type this, I realise we really need to have areas where new drivers can feel what over / under steer feels like.  What wet tarmac does for stopping distances.

Cost is an awful argument for not improving our democracy. Democracy is more important than money, and even then the costs are tiny for what we are getting. 

I was imagining having these referendums at the same time as general elections, like they do in the states, which minimises the costs and maximises the turnout. 

Referendums are binding in the same way general elections are binding on the House of Lords under the Salisbury' Convention. The Lords will easily pass any government bill if that party has a majority, and the poll corresponds to an item in that party's manifesto. The Commons views referendums in the same way. If the public makes a binding statement (such as in a referendum or election) that they must act in accordance with the public's wishes. For instance, Tony Ben supporting EU membership, because it was passed in a referendum, despite his dislike of the EU. 

I don't see what is wrong with more democracy in the UK. At the moment governments are elected with 40% of the vote or less and then legislating as if they have the will of the majority behind them. The executive has little to no oversight, apart from that afforded from the HoL and the to the courts under the Human Rights Act, which is tiny.

It takes off all traces of my makeup (waterproof mascara!!!) with minimal effort and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturised. I have combo skin that is hormonally blemish prone, and a lot of redness, so my HG product is CLEAR regular strength exfoliating fluid from [Paula's Choice UK](http://www.paulaschoice.co.uk) (£23 plus shipping, and the rest of their exfoliant range is a similar price I think). I use it every night after cleansing and it keeps the blemishes at bay, and has diminished the appearance of sebaceous filaments on my nose. You may benefit from a chemical exfoliant (it can help with how makeup sits on your nose etc), but prolly not this one - possibly an alternative one tailored for your skintype :)

First off go to the deli counter and look at the selection on offer. My judging of a good polish shop relies almost exclusively on the cold cuts available.

Spices and Coffee are for some reason always cheaper there, obviously you'll need to translate to know which ones you're buying.I highly recommend Polish mustard, it's a little smoother than the French and German varieties but goes well in sandwiches, you can get in in beer mugs(!). 

Then there's the deserts Budyn is similar to custard but thicker, comes in many flavours with cherry being my personal favorite and Kisiel is this sort of gelatin pudding that needs to be sweetened with a little sugar but which I find to be excellent.

Once he has his bearings, courtesy of Clara, I think they should phase her out, for reasons of him no longer being the Doctor she knew, and bring in new companions and have a series where the only arc is finding Gallifrey, as the next leg of the Doctor's journey.

true,atticdoor,null,null,"Here's what he said in that acting class a few years ago:

*“I left Doctor Who because I could not get along with the senior people. I left because of politics. I did not see eye-to-eye with them. I didn’t agree with the way things were being run. I didn’t like the culture that had grown up, around the series. So I left, I felt, over a principle.*

*“I thought to remain, which would have made me a lot of money and given me huge visibility, the price I would have had to pay was to eat a lot of shit. I’m not being funny about that. I didn’t want to do that and it comes to the art of it, in a way. I feel that if you run your career and– we are vulnerable as actors and we are constantly humiliating ourselves auditioning. But if you allow that to go on, on a grand scale you will lose whatever it is about you and it will be present in your work.*

*“If you allow your desire to be successful and visible and financially secure – if you allow that to make you throw shades on your parents, on your upbringing, then you’re knackered. You’ve got to keep something back, for yourself, because it’ll be present in your work.  A purity or an idealism is essential or you’ll become– you’ve got to have standards, no matter how hard work that is. So it makes it a hard road, really.*

*“You know, it’s easy to find a job when you’ve got no morals, you’ve got nothing to be compromised, you can go, ‘Yeah, yeah. That doesn’t matter. That director can bully that prop man and I won’t say anything about it’. But then when that director comes to you and says ‘I think you should play it like this’ you’ve surely got to go ‘How can I respect you, when you behave like that?’*

*“So, that’s why I left. My face didn’t fit and I’m sure they were glad to see the back of me. The important thing is that I succeeded. It was a great part. I loved playing him. I loved connecting with that audience. Because I’ve always acted for adults and then suddenly you’re acting for children, who are far more tasteful; they will not be bullshitted. It’s either good, or it’s bad. They don’t schmooze at after-show parties, with cocktails.”*

Although he mentions a prop guy at one point, the subtext appears to me to be more about disagreements about how he should play the role- effectively how he should do his job.  It strikes me as very unlikely the lead actor in a show would respond to poor treatment of the junior staff by resignation, even if someone was that selfless it still leaves the junior staff being treated that way with now no-one sticking up for them.  Wouldn't you recommend the junior staff talk to their shop-steward or make subtle comments yourself on set to ""big"" the junior staff up? 

It seems more likely to me that he and a director didn't agree over a detail of his acting, and at some stage he pointed to some minor thing that the director had said to a props guy to ""prove"" that the director was causing problems for other people too.

true,backtowriting,null,null,"I can't wait for the report, because either The Guardian or The Telegraph has been lying to us.

According to several articles in The Guardian, these schools are doing just great and have been the subject of a racist witch-hunt, smears and made-up allegations.  Whereas The Telegraph insists that the allegations are substantial and the report will be damning.

Similarly, The Guardian ran an article (yesterday?) claiming that the mayor of Tower Hamlets is a decent bloke who has been wrongfully smeared - whereas The Telegraph is reporting that he's completely corrupt.

So who's right?

Personally, I think that The Guardian simply can't be trusted on these issues.  When it comes to Islam, the paper consistently bends over backwards to avoid any attribution of blame.  

But, I think The Telegraph errs on the other side.  It knows it can excite its (often xenophobic) readership by printing stories about corrupt muslim politicians and schools.

Wouldn't it be nice if we had newspapers which would actually fairly report the issues instead of filtering everything through an increasingly polarized and ideological lens?  

Is The Independent any better?
