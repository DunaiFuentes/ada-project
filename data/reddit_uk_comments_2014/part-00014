&gt;

&gt;**The Patton Brothers**, Jimmy Patton and Brian Patton, are the two elder brothers of Paul and Barry Elliot, The Chuckle Brothers. They began their career as a double act in 1954, and their father was comedian, Gene Patton.

&gt;They have starred in many a pantomime in their careers and have not missed a performance in fifty-two years.

&gt;Jimmy Patton started his panto career straight from school in 1946, and was joined by Brian in 1956 for Aladdin at the New Wimbledon Theatre, London.

&gt;Both Jimmy and Brian have made many appearances in ChuckleVision with their younger brothers, Jimmy taking the moniker No Slacking due to the catchphrase that he constantly has to relay to the Chuckle Brothers. ""And remember - No Slacking!""

&gt;Indeed, the four all appeared together as the Chuckle Brothers on hit quiz/game show 3-2-1 with Ted Rogers on 17 April 1982 (Season 4, Episode 13), and also on New Faces.

I think this is what the article is getting at, with this response:

That ""scant"" few policies are more common then ever. I did once a comparison and obviously UKIP are not total morons, they know how to word things and differ policies so that they are not too much taken as similar to BNP (party which clearly lost it).

&gt;nationalists is said like a terrible thing but all it really means is that they are primarily interested in what's best for their country.

Yes, even at cost of hurting foreign people just because rules in the country changed? (I'm referring to the example of EU nationals possible deportation). Also, leaving EU will have its costs. Farage doesn't say ANYTHING about these and doesn't have any proper plan or even idea how these will be solved and gives example of Norway, which clearly was in different situation (and yes, Norway doesn't have full sovereignty either, besides the fact it doesn't belong to EU).

&gt;but numbers are irrelevant with as large a population as the uk, 0.8% 

Now number are irrelevant??? Wait, so why all UK shouts about 1% of immigrants as being the worst what could happen to the UK? Nearly 1% of racists in UK is not a problem though, right? Well done rhetoric!

&gt;exactly why is that fucking very wrong or anything to do with racism? are they citizens? no they are not citizens they currently have a right to work here but nobody promised them the right to stay forever and it would not be unreasonable or in actual fact deportation to discontinue their unconditional right to work here if a new government decided so. they are not saying deport people who are citizens of foreign birth why exactly is that such a fucking terrible thing?

Tell that to EU nationals (it's not terrible to throw them away from the country they established in) and basically ruin their lives. NO PROBLEM WITH THAT, AT ALL. I wonder how Brits being abroad will like that idea (and EU would do the same if such restriction were put for EU citizens in Britain). Good luck welcoming around 1.5mln British citizens and taking them on welfare (as plenty will loose jobs) and caring about pensioners. They will be very happy about it.

Now some of these things would have passed without them; but you need a majority to just do what you want and the Tory's didn't have it. 

The Lib Dem brand is now basically tory.  I'd be surprised if they get 10% in the next election.  I think they are considered toxic now.

Is it really opaque? The most opaque element of the EU machinery is the Council of Ministers.

That makes it exactly as opaque as any other intergovernmental negotiations... GATT, ACTA, etc.

So the Council of Ministers could *certainly* do with reform - but in essence, that's down to the national governments, not ""the EU"", as the Council is *their* forum.

The remainder of the EU has fairly clear &amp; transparent decision making. The Commission is fairly open, certainly when compared with other civil service bureaucracies. The Parliament is very open - their deliberations are far more rational than most debates in the Westminster Parliament.

Claiming that winning the next election would be a mandate for this is a prelude to delay or entirely fail to deliver on a second promised EU referendum. The EU desperately needs reform, but the UK needs to be a part (and ideally a central part of the EU) far more than the EU needs the UK in it.

There's general consensus on those problems, yes, but I wouldn't say there's general consensus that the only value in the EU is the open trade arrangements. There's a view, one that I personal hold, that the answer to those issues and the value of the EU can come from embracing federalisation not rejecting it for example. 

&gt;And this is what the government is currently doing (albeit in a slightly ham fisted manner) - they might just pull it off. Force a bunch of reform through the EU and then everybody gets to stay in and be happy? Long shot I know.

Again if you think that every one wants what the Tories want then yes I can see why you'd think this is a good thing.

&gt;The **drug policy of Portugal** was put in place in 2000, and was legally effective from July 2001. The new law maintained the status of illegality for using or possessing any drug for personal use without authorization. However, the offense was changed from a criminal one, with prison a possible punishment, to an administrative one if the amount possessed was no more than ten days' supply of that substance. In 1999, Portugal had the highest rate of HIV amongst injecting drug users in the European Union. The number of newly diagnosed HIV cases among drug users has decreased to 13.4 cases per million in 2009 but that is still high above the European average, at 2.85 cases per million.

true,Paludosa2,null,null,"I agree with the first part, however the economy is very important yet Sovereignty dictates the economy. The 3 issues I have identified as most important in the upcoming General Elections are:

1. Sovereignty
2. Economy
3. Immigration

Here's the reasoning:

=

Sovereignty:

Via sovereignty the Government has control over fiscal policy, monetary policy, legislation for business, trade deals, Corporate tax etc.

[Chapter 24 — Liberal Leader Mackenzie King Said in 1935](http://www.michaeljournal.org/plenty24.htm)

&gt;*""“Once a nation parts with the control of its currency and credit, it matters not who makes that nation's laws. Usury, once in control, will wreck any nation. Until the control of the issue of currency and credit is restored to government and recognized as its most conspicuous and sacred responsibility, all talk of the sovereignty of Parliament and of democracy is idle and futile.""*

&gt;*“The Liberal Party believes that credit is a public matter, not of interest to bankers only, but of direct concern to every citizen. The Liberal Party declares itself in favour of the immediate establishment of a duly constituted national bank for the control of the issue of money in terms of public needs. The flow of money must be in relation with the domestic, social, and industrial needs of the Canadian people.”*

The EU is moving towards Fiscal Union (see Merkel speeches) of the EZ-17 which is away from the UK as much as the UK is moving away from the EU. Therefore Sovereignty issues require assessment on this trend.

Also via sovereignty the Government has elected responsibility and are accountable for their actions to the population. Increasing democratic processes (primaries recall) See:

[2013 - a good year for Parliament](http://www.talkcarswell.com/home/2013--a-good-year-for-parliament/2747)

1. Parliament recovers its purpose
2. Open Primaries catch on
3. Recall
4. Select Committees grow up
5. Speaker Bercow
6. The internet
7. Sofa government gets less comfy

=

Economy:

This hinges a lot on the above: To boost UK's productivity and it's competitiveness and increase it's exports and manufacturing as well as safeguard it's financial industry: The UK must leave the EU which will have multiple positives to the Economic growth away from the QE strategy.

[Global Britain: UK Trade in 2012: Comparison of Trade - Outside EU vs Inside EU](http://www.globalbritain.org/BNN/BN87.pdf)

On the other hand the economy of the EU is a complete train wreck:

[It's Official: New EU Bank Reform Disastrous For EU, Euro, Everyone - 14 Reasons](http://seekingalpha.com/article/1910931-its-official-new-eu-bank-reform-disastrous-for-eu-euro-everyone-14-reasons)

Politically it's a time-bomb also.

=

Immigration:

Why is this important. This is important to be selective about the skills-shortage, to take pressure off the unemployed ""blue collar"" employment market and reduce the social welfare bill of the country with more people in work and less dependent on welfare as well as the politicians working for the UK's working class benefit. Again this is important for a politically strong government which again is important for sovereignty and economy.

Finally the recent rate of net immigration is huge and the requirement for housing and infrastructure needs to track this demographic increase. Reducing immigration I think will be of benefit for civil society as well as removing various other issues: Crime, Welfare, Infrastructure, Job markets for non-eu skilled-workers, student visas, asylum etc etc.

There's also the past track record of the government breaking promises on this policy of border control which again has reduced democratic engagement with the population.",0,1389783823,null,0,1389784149,0,ceq26gr,t3_1v9hgc,t1_ceq26gr,t1_ceq1rpk,null,1435530701,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Not around my neck of the woods. Of course I'm not under the impression that that makes it *the* general consensus because I'm perfectly aware I'm at the extreme end of spectrum. Still there *is* a spectrum in which it's perfectly possible to see the need for reform of the EU with out the need to reduce it to simply being free trade. 

&gt;no suggesting it has a rough, general consensus

I'd argue that it not. Remember that a large part (if not most actually) of the population voted for largely pro EU parties. 

&gt;well that is how democracy works - the elected gov has to come up with a position - you can't do EU reform by referendum, only simple questions can be answered that way.

Going back to the above the government is currently a consolation of a largely pro EU party and a largely not so pro EU party. The Tories are not, in other words, ruling in their own right and as such I don't think they have a mandate to push for such drastic changes with in the EU at this time. 

I'm not suggesting that we have a referendum on each and every reform just that all of this needs to wait until after the next election gives a clear indication of what way we should go.

true,lewiji,null,null,"I've been a web developer for 10 years now, and started without any qualifications (though I now have a software engineering degree). Currently working as a HTML5 games developer, which is great fun. My advice:

Start a github account, learn how to use it and put your work up on there. Employers really like to see this kind of thing even if you have no 'real' portfolio. I, for example, have done most of my work for private businesses and internal websites, so I don't have a huge public portfolio. What I do have is a semi-active Github account with plenty of code to look at and a couple of projects that are actually useful to people. Seeing a Biology degree, potential employers will want to see whether you're active in your pursuit of web development and github is a great way to show your skills, especially if you can find some open source projects to contribute to.

Try and focus on programming in general rather than just whatever snippets of PHP and Javascript you can find to get the job done. For every bit of javascript and PHP you write, see if you can look up the relevant programming patterns and techniques, and you'll find you can apply those concepts to any language. This helps majorly in being able to talk confidently about technical subjects in interviews.

In my experience, a lot of companies in the UK are lagging behind in terms of their web tech. Lots of outdated practices, no source control, poor code architecture, and often these are large systems that are difficult to replace. I'd suggest you learn about modern best practices and tools (Jenkins, Yeoman/Grunt, BDD testing, git, Puppet/Chef, modular javascript, Laravel / Symfony [PHP frameworks], Backbone / Meteor / React / Angular [Javascript frameworks]). It's a lot to take in at first, but if you can learn the advantages of using these over 'the old way' this can be a big bonus in the eyes of employers. Often, their tech stacks are waaay outdated but they don't have the time/knowledge to adopt best practices. If you can come in and demonstrate that you're capable of doing those things (and tell them why they're better), you'll be a very valuable hire. I've found that many companies want to adopt best practices and new technologies but were just waiting for the right person to come and do it.",0,1389784543,null,0,false,0,ceq2a7k,t3_1v73ln,t1_ceq2a7k,t3_1v73ln,null,1431950968,3,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,3

true,MonkeysOnIce,null,null,"Before coming to te Red Sox Carl Crawford was one of the most dangerous hitters in MLB. He has unbelievable speed, patience at bat so he could get on base, good contact and could hit for power. Some would say that's a five tool player. That is everything you want in a baseball player. He came to the Red Sox and couldn't handle the pressure that Boston fans and media put on him. He was also oft injured and underwhelmed when healthy for lengthy periods of time. Sounds like that 35£ striker...

Adrian Gonzalez was a gold glove first basemen whit hit for average, and could hit to the opposite field, which is key at Fenway when a lefty is batting opposite field to the close up Green Monster. He also hit for power with the Padres who play in not only one of the most favorable pitchers park, but a division that was loaded with stadia alike that. He started slow for the Red Sox but improved slowly until he was hitting around .300.

Now in 2012 the team was in complete collapse and the general manager, Ben Cherrington decided that if this team with all this money is dragging us down and our season is already lost, then dump the salaries on another team (Gonzalez and Crawford had 5yrs/100m+ left on their contracts, josh Beckett another 10-14m a year). Once that salary space is cleared the Red Sox were free to do just about anything they wanted in the off season as far as player moves. They had the market to recover revenue wise, from a poor season, and the history to attract players, and still had a solid core from the year before (Pedroia, Ortiz, Lester). And they won the WS. 

Tl;dr: it just didn't work out for Crawford and Gonzalez. Can say the same for Downing and Carroll

Edit: and don't forget that there are no ""transfer fees"" in baseball so what was spent was spent on salaries had they survived the full length of the contract. Those salaries are off the Red Sox books (for the most part).

&gt;Yes, even at cost of hurting foreign people just because rules in the country changed?

it's not hurting to stop helping

&gt;Also, leaving EU will have its costs. Farage doesn't say ANYTHING about these and doesn't have any proper plan or even idea how these will be solved and gives example of Norway, which clearly was in different situation

I never said they had a clue what actually was in the best interests in the country, allthough I will say it's by no means a certainty that it's better to be in than out.

&gt;Now number are irrelevant??? Wait, so why all UK shouts about 1% of immigrants as being the worst what could happen to the UK? Nearly 1% of racists in UK is not a problem though, right? Well done rhetoric!

one guy in 100 is a racist? who cares im not the racist and I dont think the majority of UKIP supporters are either, rhetoric is taking 1% and calling it ""all UK shouts""(which doesnt make any sense to start with)

&gt;Tell that to EU nationals (it's not terrible to throw them away from the country they established in) and basically ruin their lives. NO PROBLEM WITH THAT, AT ALL.

no there isnt a problem, it's the risk *they* took when *they* decided to live and work in another country but not apply for citizenship, if they had been planning to live there forever they would have already applied for nationality here

&gt;I wonder how Brits being abroad will like that idea

they might not, but just because someone doesnt like something doesnt make it inherently wrong.

get over yourself you big drama queen, I'm on the fence about the EU personally, havent made up my mind either way, I wanted this objective discussion about this topic with you not because I am a selfish Brit etc. but simply because I think you are far too quick to condemn other people and their motives out of simple iration that they dare to hold different views to you, and because I think you are entirely wrong that a change to the rights of foreign nationals to work in our country is morally wrong and I have outlined why, instead of addressing my point that they are owed nothing you try a personal attack and continue your insistance that it is a terrible thing. it is you who does not want an objective discussion because you do not stop and question the objectivity of your own opinions.

&gt;

&gt;**4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine** (**2C-B**) is a psychedelic drug of the 2C family. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1974. In Shulgin's book PiHKAL, the dosage range is listed as 16–24 mg. 2C-B is sold as a white powder sometimes pressed in tablets or gel caps and is referred to on the street as '**Rusko'**, '**Spectrum'**, '**Venus'**, '**B's'**, '**CB's'**, or '**Nexus'**. The drug is usually taken orally, but can also be insufflated or vaporized.

&gt;Does that seem ""fair""? That one person pays the same tax by himself as 42 other people combined ... because that's how the figures work out. The top 1% of earners are paying 29.8% of the income tax.

Yes it does seem fair, if wealth was distributed more evenly then tax rates could be more even, but its not so they aren't. 

Admittedly I think that the tax thresholds starts to low, a higher threshold should be considered, possibly hitting those who earn over 5 million. 

Any course of action would have to include an agreement between major countries to ensure such a brain drain/ capital flight does not occur. It will be interesting to watch what unfolds in France as I think they have just imposed a 75% income tax on high earners.

I must stress that it is not tax revenue that bothers me, it is workers pay, the emphasis needs to be on deterring companies from having such a top-heavy pay structure.

&gt;**Psychedelic agents in creative problem-solving experiment** was a study designed to evaluate whether the use of a psychedelic substance with supportive setting can lead to improvement of performance in solving professional problems. The altered performance was measured by subjective reports, questionnaires, the obtained solutions for the professional problems and psychometric data using the Purdue Creativity, the Miller Object Visualization, and the Witkins Embedded Figures tests. This experiment was a pilot that was to be followed by control studies as part of exploratory studies on uses for psychedelic drugs, that were interrupted early in 1966 when the Food and Drug Administration declared a moratorium on research with human subjects, as a strategy in combating the illicit-use problem.

Just sticking to the EU theme, but here are several non-political view that say they could.

&gt;2. In the debate on Scottish independence it is natural that opponents tend to exaggerate the difficulties of EU membership, while proponents tend to minimise them. This note tries to address the subject as objectively as possible. In summary it argues that:

&gt;* Arrangements for Scotland’s EU membership would need to be in place simultaneously with independence
* Scotland’s 5 million people, having been members of the EU for 40 years; have acquired rights as European citizens
* For practical and political reasons they could not be asked to leave the EU and apply for readmission
* Negotiations on the terms of membership would take place in the period between the referendum and the planned date of independence 
* The EU would adopt a simplified procedure for the negotiations, not the traditional procedure followed for the accession of non-member countries

&gt;An **ad hominem** (Latin for ""to the man"" or ""to the person""), short for **argumentum ad hominem**, is a general category of fallacies in which a claim or argument is rejected on the basis of some irrelevant fact about the author of or the person presenting the claim or argument. Fallacious Ad hominem reasoning is normally categorized as an informal fallacy, more precisely as a genetic fallacy, a subcategory of fallacies of irrelevance. Ad hominem reasoning is not always fallacious, for example, when it relates to the credibility of statements of fact.

While the EU nations are significant trading partners, the car industry managed to grow to record levels while EU demand was in the doldrums, and this is an industry which people claim we only have because of the EU.

Would a 10% tariff on selling to the EU do very much damage? Particularly as it would enable us to import steel and components from outside the EU without tariffs.

Tariffs with the EU aren't going to wipe out trade between us, and loss of demand for British goods in the EU could be made up for by demand from outside the EU.

Also is the EU going to go through with imposing tariffs? We import £40 billion from Germany alone, and £20 billion from France, and £20 billion for the Netherlands. 

All together we import more from the EU than we export to the EU. The EU has waived tariffs before, it'd be in their interests to agree to at least a limited free trade agreement with the UK.

He is vital because we don't have any other players for that role.He is a good player for that position.

In fact as I have said many times:

Against poor/decent/quality opposition. .....

Lucas is quality/decent/poor (with some notable exceptions)

His qualities are as you listed previously, yet his major deficiencies are :

a lack of pace to cover the ground

A lack of physicality, leading too a lack of presence

When the tempo of the game increases he tends to go missing, when he should be the player to wrestle the midfield battle back in our favor. He rarely is.

He is a busy, hard working player and his stats reflect that. Stats, as in most cases in football, tell only a small part of the story. 

We could do with competition for his place at the very least. I know its just a rumour but Fernando would be an interesting signing if it were to happen.

It's understandable that the UK doesn't want people to come here where they might leech off the system. Clearly your wife doesn't fit that bill since she has a British degree, has worked, has paid tax (and presumably will continue to do so), but many many people would not fit this bill and would find it very convenient to marry into a British visa.

But in order to stop all sorts of people being ""imported"" into the country, there need to be some financial requirements, and other requirements too. For instance, they come to see where you live to ensure that there is space for her (basically checking that she isn't being imported into slavery, force marriage etc). I'm sure you can see the reason for those checks. 

IMO £18600 isn't an unreasonably high salary requirement - especially if you consider that it's meant to support two people. Nor is £16000 an unreasonable savings requirement - considering it's less than a year of living expenses and it could easily take either of you that long to find stable jobs.

It definitely sucks, but the law is there for very good reason. And frankly, the UK has these requirements to stop others from being a drain on the system. But your other point is entirely right. Making the distinction between EU and non-EU is absolutely retarded. The entire system should be merit/finance based, not geography based, so I do feel very sorry for you.

Have you had any other advice about this? Wouldn't it be beneficial for her to get a job offer from a UK employer, and then they sponsor her in? That at least gets her here, then you can start proceedings (as well as building up enough savings to get the spouse visa). Or if you get really desperate, can you parents with the good salaries just dump £16k into your bank account for the purpose of checking?

I'll try to make my point on that element in a fashion that hopefully you can't possibly misconstrue.

1.  It was confirmed by the EU's lawyers that the residual UK *(if we ignore the stupidity dribbling out of the Conservative party)* would remain a member of the EU and that Scotland as a new state would have to apply for membership.

2.  A lot of the proposals set out by the SNP rely on an independent Scotland having access to the full set of controls over the economy.

2a.  Various demands have previously been made by the EU of the Republic of Ireland with regard to tax rates, before they were last bailed out.  The only reason they got away with playing chicken and refusing to increase their Corporation Tax rate was that the Irish banks owed so much money to other EU banks *(German banks in particular)* that no one had the balls to let them go under.

3.  Scotland would have to apply to join the EU as a new member state.  Admission would be little more than a formality, **but** it would come with conditions.  Unlike Ireland Scotland wouldn't get away with because while not being up to its collective eyeballs in debt is generally a good thing in this case it would leave an independent Scotland without the leverage to say no and at the same time gain admission.

Therefore I believe that while Scotland would join the EU, I also believe that a lot of the promises will become undeliverable.

if this doesn't work, call/email the university (probably best to do so after you are accepted!). i think that when i was at university, there were people who helped foreign students find things like local banking.  they should be able to recommend a bank that has a local branch / is helpful to foreign students.  the truth is that most banks are very similar once you have the account open.  a lot of people like first direct for their customer service (myself included), but they are relatively strict about who they accept.

i don't know if you will be able to open a student account, but if the opportunity exists, it is probably a good one. most come with some sort of benefit. 

i wouldn't look to invest the money in anything with any risk, but you should try and make sure that you put them in a savings account with a decent interest rate.  If you can find a 2% interest rate, that's worth £600 a year to you. you could consider government bonds, but you will probably get a better rate in a savings account.

if you haven't already done so, consider when you will transfer the money into £GBP. I don't know where you are from, but if the money is in another currency, then you are at the mercy of exchange rates in determining how much you have to spend in the UK.  for example, the USD/GBP rate has changed by about 10% over the past year, which would be a big change (maybe good, maybe bad) for your situation!  my suggestion would be to transfer the money into GBP as soon as you know you will be coming to London.  there is little point gambling with the timing of such a move, better to get it done and not worry about it.",0,1389791638,null,0,false,0,ceq3irn,t3_1v9l79,t1_ceq3irn,t3_1v9l79,null,1431951532,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

Put simply, The UK *will* have Scotlands back on this, add to that the fact that as I said, England is our only land border and as such there is little material benefit to the EU for imposing this on us. If you go further and look at the EU as an organisation, at its very core it has taken the idea that free trade within the EU should expand at all costs and barriers to it should be removed, I would think that a very real barrier being erected between a Schengen Scotland and non-Schengen UK would go against the very Ideals that the EU has been seeking to implement all these years.

---

&gt;The terms **right-hand traffic** and **left-hand traffic** refer to regulations requiring all bidirectional traffic, unless otherwise directed, to keep either to the right or the left side of the road, respectively. This is so fundamental to traffic flow that it is sometimes referred to as the **rule of the road**. This basic rule improves traffic flow and reduces the risk of head-on collisions. Today, about 65% of the world's population live in countries with right-hand traffic and 35% in countries with left-hand traffic. About 90% of the world's total road distance carries traffic on the right and 10% on the left.

Looking at the data over the years, we can assume there is probably a natural demand of between perhaps 2.0 and 2.25 million new cars per year in the UK. Sales above those figures may require a substantial additional effort. 

Nowadays cars are much more reliable, and last a lot longer. I view a drop in demand as an entirely good thing, as it reflects this reality. 
As capital costs are a big part of the cost of car ownership, this means that we don't need to spend as much on cars. This allows people to reduce their indebtedness and / or have a larger disposable income.

&gt;The **impostor syndrome**, sometimes called **impostor phenomenon** or **fraud syndrome**, is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments. Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be.

At the time of its first appearance, the song was released by the Beatles' record company as a single in the United States but not in the United Kingdom (for further details see below). Consequently, whilst it topped the American chart in 1965 the song first hit the British top 10 three months after the release of Help! in a cover version by Matt Monro.

Conservatives (with a little 'c' - so the political position, not the Party) like human rights because they're a nice, liberal position - after all, it was some British Conservatives (with a big 'c') who led the drafting of the ECHR and pushed it on Europe. Some people are turning against it now because conservatism is becoming increasingly authoritarian, and because they seem to be of the impression that these rights should only apply to their kind of people (not foreigners, immigrants, criminals etc.).

In contrast, the issues I raised (employment rights, consumer rights) are left-wing areas; things that conservatives tend to be opposed to as they interfere with the free market and stop businesses from being able to do what they want.

However, going back to the argument against the ECHR, on the grounds that they want decisions made in the UK, that is (a) a little bit racist, and (b) nonsense.

It's racist in the sense that it implies that people outside the UK (thus foreigners) can't make sensible decisions.

It's nonsense partly because the Human Rights Act (which conservatives seem to hate so) was passed so that human rights decisions could be made in domestic courts (who may consider decisions of the ECtHR or foreign courts, but are not bound by them). And partly because human rights decisions in the UK are still ultimately made by Parliament, something that has been confirmed again and again.

Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act

&gt;It is an offence for a person to be in possession of an extreme pornographic image.
&gt;An image falls within this subsection if it portrays, in an explicit and realistic way, any of the following—

&gt;* an act which threatens a person's life,
&gt;* an act which results, or is likely to result, in serious injury to a person's anus, breasts or genitals,
&gt;* an act which involves sexual interference with a human corpse, or
&gt;* a person performing an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive),

true,vishbar,null,null,"Cool! So, here's what I'd recommend. I'll give a few examples for each style.

If you like Belgians, I can go into that too :). As a note: I lived in San Francisco, meaning I'm very heavily exposed to West Coast beer. I am not as familiar with East Coast, Midwest, or Colorado brewing.

Overall, American craft beers lean to higher ABVs as most are distributed bottled or kegged. 

So...

**Hop Bombs**

Common American hop varietals (Crystal, Willamette, Centennial, etc.) have a slightly different flavor and smell to British and European hops (Goldings, Fuggles, etc.). While European hops are earthy, American hops tend to have a citrusy or piney aroma.

* Sierra Nevada Hoptimum IPA - 10.4% ABV, super strong. This (like most beers in this category) is a blow-your-face-off palate-wrecker.

* Stone Arrogant Bastard - Not an IPA as such, but an American-style barley wine. Very hoppy--*very*--but with malty notes as well. If you can get your hands on an Oak Aged Arrogant Bastard, go for it. It adds a lot of oakey, vanilla-y subtlety to the beer.

* Russian River Pliny the Elder / Younger - These are really rare--to the point that a London brewery sold tickets (and sold out, if I recall) at a tapping. You might find Elder in a bottle shop, though. It's the quintessential West Coast IPA.

**Pretty Hoppy**

These will be more common

* Sierra Nevada Torpedo, Lagunitas IPA - both are decent, tasty IPAs.

* Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, Deschutes Red Chair NWPA - less hoppy than the previous, tasty, nothing too exciting about them but they're really tasty beers.

**Malty and Lighter**

* Anderson Valley Boont Amber Ale - Very nice amber ale, a little hoppy but most similar to a bitter.

* Lagunitas Censored - Lagunitas normally produces hoppy-as-hell stuff, but this one is really tasty.

* New Belgium Fat Tire - This beer is ""meh"". Not nearly as good as the others on this list, but still fairly tasty. New Belgium is one of the largest American craft brewers, so it's very widely available.

* Anchor Steam - A pretty good beer from my former hometown, San Francisco. It's a steam beer, a style of lager that is fairly unique to California. Don't be put off by the word ""lager""--it's no Budweiser. It won't ""wow"" you, but it's a decently drinkable beer and what I'd order when I was out with friends and didn't want to wake up the next morning feeling like death.

**Porters/Stouts**

This is one of my favorite styles.

* Anderson Valley Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout - Simply outstanding. In my opinion, this, along with Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, is the platonic idea of the style.

* Green Flash Double Stout - Another great one. Brewed in San Diego

* Ninkasi Oatis - Another oatmeal stout - not as good as Anderson Valley, but still good!

* North Coast Old Rasputin Imperial Stout - Fantastic Imperial Stout. High abv - around 9% - and a very strong taste, but really good if you're into big beers.

true,layendecker,crest-new,OLD CREST 4EVA,"Jones would be signed solely as a backup player, and a plan C. Contrary to popular belief he is actually a pretty decent target man who created a lot for himself back in his Sunderland days- he certainly isn't a replacement for Jelavic, but a replacement for Vellios- who, while working as a strategic adjustment later in the game is just not good enough at football to be a PL player. 

Martinez is showing that he wants a level of dynamism in the way we play, from opening up a counter-attack by bringing on Deulofeu, or physical guys higher up the pitch by moving up McCarthy and Barry-  he is always adjusting our tactics to assist us late on. 

What Jones would provide, as I said before is a dedicated target man with better distribution than Lukaku. He would be used in the same way Vellios was, but unlike Vellios he is a player with some ability both in linking up play and (if he can get his Sunderland form back) in front of goal.

Imagine if you are a tired defender, and the opposition brings on Deulofeu and Jones late on- you are not going to know where to put yourself, and that is what Martinez is looking to exploit here I feel.

Of course the perfect option would be if we could get a long term starting 11 player in now, blood him in over the course of the second half of the season so he is ready for GW1 next year, but we need to be realistic and remember that this may not be an option.

&gt;The **technological singularity**, or simply **the singularity**, is a hypothetical moment in time when artificial intelligence will have progressed to the point of a greater-than-human intelligence, radically changing civilization, and perhaps human nature. Since the capabilities of such an intelligence may be difficult for a human to comprehend, the technological singularity is often seen as an occurrence (akin to a gravitational singularity) beyond which the future course of human history is unpredictable or even unfathomable.

true,thorwawayaaya,null,null,"&gt; To be conservative assume house prices are rising at 5% annually.

This is not a ""conservative"" estimate but quite optimistic.  A realistic estimate is that the cost of the place will keep up with inflation in the long run.  Look up some historic home price graphs and you'll see that this is true.  The graph you linked to in your comment later is not the true long run - look back further.  Edit: for example on how these numbers got skewed in this ""long run"" picture, consider how high inflation was during the 80s and how housing prices doubled so fast in that time as a result.  That was abnormally high inflation and is unlikely to return.

Your numbers are also not realistic for a lot of other reasons.  Namely, you aren't including property taxes, tax advantage, maintenance (a big, often way underestimated expense) and insurance.  Another big one is broker fees, both for buying and later on selling the place.  Another aspect of this is that without any money invested into home improvement there is some factor of depreciation since people value older style places less than new ones overall.

The main idea of what you're writing is true though.

*AND THAT'S THE POINT!*  

The Commission is there to not be beholden to any one state or constituent electorates.  It's there to forward a political project, not represent the will of the people under it or its member states.

&gt;It's true that Parliament cannot remove individual commisioners via a no-confidence vote, but only the Commission as a whole. I'll also grant you that the Commission has more power to shape EU law than Lords does to shape UK law: 

Gracious of you, thank you.

&gt;but I can't help but feel that we should sort out our own undemocratic festering mess before complaining about the EU.

You do that bringing accountability and sovereignty back to the UK.

It's a mandatory prerequisite to empowering and reengaging the electorate so they begin to demand more.  We bring the deferred power back.  People will be apathetic about reforming something which has little power and which makes little difference having most of its relevance deferred away to higher ups.   You don't even have to empower the Lords, they're just the check on the Commons.  You just have to bring sovereignty back and the Lords become more relevant.

Likewise, if you wanted people to start turning out for council elections and caring about those results, getting them interested in the community and local politics,  then you'd devolve real local  power to them and the newly re-engaged electorate will be eminently more qualified to keep the new powers accountable if through nothing else but proximity and familiarity.  That's another problem with the EU - it's very difficult to stay familiar with 28 countries and their poltics, all with several parties each.  Not only is there little proximity, it's nigh on impossible for the Average Joe to keep track of all the players.  

The Lords would be a lot more relevant, and therefore there'd be far more impetus to reform them, if we had true sovereignty.  As it is we're switching people off because they're realising that more and more of the daily politicking is irrelevant and in many ways a variety of choice has been deferred to aloof overseas government they find difficult to hold accountable.  

They're stuck in a seemingly unreformable EU, with a Commission that doesn't even attempt to represent them, and the three main parties are constrained to narrow alternatives workable within the EU - so they're certainly not going to try and do anything too controversial like meaningful home reform whilst they're effectively just passing or working within EU agenda.

Take the EU shackles off and the parties will start to become more divergent.  They won't be fighting over slender middleground, they'll be lining up to capitalise on reforms.",0,1389799447,null,0,1389801377,0,ceq5wve,t3_1v9jcs,t1_ceq5wve,t1_ceq5h7k,null,1431952697,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

(b)must describe the protected information to which the notice relates;
(c)must specify the matters falling within subsection (2)(b)(i) or (ii) by reference to which the notice is given;
(d)must specify the office, rank or position held by the person giving it;
(e)must specify the office, rank or position of the person who for the purposes of Schedule 2 granted permission for the giving of the notice or (if the person giving the notice was entitled to give it without another person’s permission) must set out the circumstances in which that entitlement arose;
(f)must specify the time by which the notice is to be complied with; and
(g)must set out the disclosure that is required by the notice and the form and manner in which it is to be made;and the time specified for the purposes of paragraph (f) must allow a period for compliance which is reasonable in all the circumstances.

The important bit is it that you must describe the protected information to which the notice relates.  That means you have to have specific insight into what it is and why you want the key.  

There is also a safeguard that (in theory) means that having obtained the key, they can only use the information on the encrypted file that is related to that matter (ie if you think there is credit card fraud and then it turns out it is something else, I'm not sure that they are allowed to prosecute you for it - it would be inadmisable in any court).

Not quite.

The police can't prove which. This is the controversial bit, the police do not have actual proof that the known criminal is lying, but once he does fold and give them the key the police can see that he had a motive from the evidence they discover in the house.

If you've lived in an area which has had a large, sudden surge in new immigrants you might feel differently. Imagine you are surrounded by people who don't speak English, people who may even hate/fear you and have prejudice against you or start to complain about the way things are done in your area, then you might feel differently. You go to the doctors and it's all filled with people who don't speak english. You get stared at by people wondering why you are in their street, even though you live there. You read about your local council spending millions on translation services for all the people who don't know English, but they can't fix the pot holes in your street. etc etc etc Then you might start to feel like your country is being invaded. And I think that's quite understandable.

This is the problem with the previous decade of immigration.

It's not xenophobic or racist - it's not specifically about the colour of the skin or where people come from.

pay attention to this - 

""Let me turn now to the circumstances surrounding the European Investment Bank loan. The loan to Ford for its Turkish Transit van operation was approved as part of the EIB’s support for Turkey’s integration into the European Union economy. The Turkish operation has been in existence since 2001, and since 2009, it has made all versions of the Transit apart from the chassis cab variant, which is made at Southampton. The EIB loan for the Turkish operation was for retooling the Turkish plant for the production of the next model in 2013 and was not based on the cessation of production at Southampton. It is therefore incorrect to imply that the EIB loan is itself responsible for exporting jobs from the UK. Indeed, Ford tells us that it will not be increasing capacity at the Turkish site.

The EIB makes investments in key markets outside and inside the European Union. For instance, Ford UK benefited from up to £400 million of EIB funding back in 2010."" - The Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (Michael Fallon)

immediately followed by this from John Denham: 

""Mr Denham: For the record, I do not think that any Member has suggested that the loan to Turkey was responsible for the closure of the Southampton plant, but rather that it undoubtedly helped Ford to develop Turkey, which therefore helped it to close the plant. ""

1) A pacey attacking fullback that is comfortable playing with either foot. BR's system demands a lot from this position, and I don't think we can expect to get it until we have more competition.

2) A winger or attacking midfielder with a goal-scoring record.  We are creating so many chances, and just lack that little bit of extra quality to convert them when they fall to Coutinho/Sterling/Henderson.

3) A quality defensive midfielder who tackles fearlessly, is confident on the ball, and plays passes forward quickly on the counter.  I don't buy Gerrard for the role.  He's a bit of a liability with his pace and is used to taking too much risk with his passing, which is fine in the final third, but I've seen it cost us in our half of the field quite a bit.

During my time at Uni not a single person shied away or did/said anything remotely racist towards me when I presented my nationality. Also, since I started work, there hasn't been anyone, whether a client or co-worker that has had any issues with where I hail from.

What I do understand and what does get me riled up is the image this reactionary and racist media is painting Romania in. UK's news outlets have a lot of priority exposure worldwide and will be considered more 'reliable' than stories coming in from sources in smaller, lesser-voiced countries. As a result, I think this is the first thing planted into the mind of anyone reading about Romanians that hasn't had any direct interaction with us, and as we all know, public opinion is highly malleable. This isn't entirely British media's fault, though. Almost all other EU countries where there have been a large number of Romanian immigrants have done the same thing initially (until the opinion was well set in the minds of the population or no one cared any more), not to mention that Romanian politicians and media are so highly incompetent and dismissive towards our portrayal that they would rather see our country get slandered than forgotten. 

TL;DR: None of the Britons I met were ever racist towards me, but I hate the way Romanians get portrayed in the media and the lack of response from Romanian authorities/media.

My point is that not every one shares those views. The details of those views are not what I was looking to get into. However I will a little 'cus of reasons.

Now to start I understand that my personal views with regards to embracing federalisation are extreme at this stage. More commonly it's just a case if you think there is value in where the EU is now and if you think the issues with it can be overcome to better improve that value. The answer to the question of the EU is not simply ""less of what it is"" but it can be ""doing what it does better.""

The ""out of the EU"" have a voice because it's a return to something that people already accept. Becoming one part of a larger state doesn't because no one alive in the UK has ever had to deal with the idea of the UK as anything but it's own sovereign sate. More it's been over a thousand years since we where last subsumed by another state and not all that long since we went around the world doing the subsuming. 

The idea of ""giving up"" our sovereign status is used by the anti EU lot as a boogy man because they think we should make choices about us. But really it's just a question of where do you draw the line about ""us"" currently we draw it at England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Island. But in a few years Scotland might be removed from that list. If the UK being it's own sovereign state is so inevitable and important because it's a way for ""us"" to make choices that effect ""us"" clearly we can only support the idea of Scotland wanting to make their own sovereign choices about Scotland? 

What about the divide between London and the rest of the UK? Or Liverpool and Manchester? If it's so damn important that we make sovereign choices about the UK only with in the UK why not by county or city? 

The point of such a reductive argument is that the answer, at some point down the line, is that mutual cooperation democratically directed lets us do more as a group than we'd each be able to do as the individual sum of our parts. You still have local councils that have given authority to deal with local issues with in this structure but you also work at a national level because of the benefits that brings. 

I just happen to think that a reorganisation to bring the EU together to effectively act like a state in that same way will end up making the slice of that pie vastly bigger than the size of our own but whole one. In fact I think it's vital to facing the huge risks that are in our future and I think if none of the billion crisis's that are looming turn up it will allow us to make the world an over all better place than we found it and do better by every citizen.    

I simply don't think the idea of a sovereign state holds any value other than what it can do for the people and giving up that sovereignty to become part of a large sovereign state doesn't have to come with a loss of identity or political agency.

I think people are forgetting the fact that if we manage to hold onto 4th place this season, we need the quality of depth to cover almost twice the number of games (potentially).

Currently we're not even close. And if we leave ourselves too much to do in the summer, we're going to run out of players that are good for us and happy to sign.

Also I don't want us to get CL, pull a Tottenham and buy 8 new players, and then need 6 months for them to click. we need to introduce depth into the squad over time to avoid this, and unfortunately we only have 2 windows worth of time.

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"&gt; The conservatives I talked to have a number of issues with a number of these 'European' bodies - EU, ECHR etc etc. 

What does the ""etc"" stand for; what are the other 'European' bodies, and what do the EU and ECHR have in common other than being legal entities with ""Europe"" in their title? Given that this was a discussion about the EU, not the ECHR, it seems odd to bring in the latter.

&gt;  its simply about having decisions made in the country they directly affect...

Here I would suggest there is a difference between a reason and a justification. There are some people who object to the ECtHR or EU on the grounds that they are foreign, it is encouraging to see you are not one of them.

However, there are still at least three problems with this justification:

* What if a decision directly affects more than one country? Like... every decision of the ECtHR or CJEU. Where should that decision be made?

* What is special about the UK as a country? Does the same logic apply to Northern Ireland and Scotland - is it wrong that their Supreme Court and Parliament aren't in their countries? Is it wrong that the Welsh High Court and Court of Appeal is in England? As someone who lives outside London, can I reject the UK Courts and Parliament if their rules directly affect me when I'm outside London while they're in London? What about people living outside Westminster (where the UKSC and Parliament are)? Where is the line drawn, and how is that line not based on arbitrary historical boundaries?

* Why does it matter? How does justice vary on location? If the ECtHR was based in London (or Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast) would that settle the problems these conservatives have?

&gt; I think the outcome that is desired is not to have to invoke parliament to make final rulings on cases, but be able to trust a UK court as the final arbiter. 

The UKSC *is* a final arbiter of applying (most)^* UK laws, aside from Parliament, which can, and does, sometimes overrule the courts. The ECtHR and CJEU do not rule on UK laws, the former rules on the application of the ECHR, and has no direct effect on UK laws, the CJEU on EU law and only affects UK laws to the effect that the EU law already does.

--------------

^* The exceptions being Criminal law in Scotland, which stops with the High Court of Justiciary, and a few of the weirder historical courts which appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, although that is effectively the UKSC.",0,1389805639,null,0,false,0,ceq8mq3,t3_1v9hgc,t1_ceq8mq3,t1_ceq63x7,null,1431953984,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Maybe /r/LiverpoolFC can vote on the two final designs or something like that as well.

And if we're feeling ambitious, perhaps a special postcard can be created with a bit of each sale going to a charity or something? That way there'd be some way to try and compensate you for your time and us Redditors can get a warm fuzzy feeling for supporting you as well as a charity! :)

true,Mayniac182,cnty-england,London,"&gt;Rather than banning drugs after they have been launched onto the market, as most of the world currently does, New Zealand proposes to test and license drugs before they are launched

Not really a good example, considering the fact that we do the same. The problem is that drugs are labelled as ""not for human consumption"" and labelled as bath salts or, as my local legal high store calls them, pot pourri. You can't regulate that industry because there's no way to ban them without banning a whole lot of other non-drug products, like actual bath salts. Lush would probably go out of business within days.

The best solution would be to legalise drugs we know to be moderately safe (MDMA, LSD, 2C-X, etc) and allow manufacturers of legal highs to switch production to these chemicals. People are more willing to purchase these drugs because they have a positive reputation, so the research chemical market would shrink. Also considering that research chemical suppliers are largely based in China and other Asian countries, where manufacturing MDMA/LSD etc is illegal, production could be moved to the UK which brings in business, creates jobs and gets the government more money in taxes. If other countries in Europe legalised too, we'd already have the facilities for supplying them and we could take advantage of the expanding market (e.g. more money). Newly created drugs could then be regulated in the same way the pharmaceutical industry is: products are illegal to sell until extensive testing and approval by the MHRA. 

Of course all that would require the government to admit they were wrong for decades, and we all know how much they hate that. ",0,1389807980,null,0,false,0,ceq9qdi,t3_1v9irn,t1_ceq9qdi,t3_1v9irn,null,1431954556,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

&gt;**Love** refers to a variety of different feelings, states, and attitudes that ranges from interpersonal affection (""I love my mother"") to pleasure (""I loved that meal""). It can refer to an emotion of a strong attraction and personal attachment. It can also be a virtue representing human kindness, compassion, and affection—""the unselfish loyal and benevolent concern for the good of another"". It may also describe compassionate and affectionate actions towards other humans, one's self or animals.

&gt;**Caffeine** is a bitter, white crystalline xanthine alkaloid and a stimulant drug. Caffeine is found in varying quantities in the seeds, leaves, and fruit of some plants, where it acts as a natural pesticide that paralyzes and kills certain insects feeding on the plants, as well as enhancing the reward memory of pollinators. It is most commonly consumed by humans in infusions extracted from the seed of the coffee plant and the leaves of the tea bush, as well as from various foods and drinks containing products derived from the kola nut. Other sources include yerba maté, guarana berries, guayusa, and the yaupon holly.

**European Commission**  
&gt; The European Commission (EC) is the executive body of the European Union responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the Union's treaties and day-to-day running of the EU.
The Commission operates as a cabinet government, with 28 members of the Commission (informally known as ""commissioners""). There is one member per member state, though members are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state. One of the 28 is the Commission President (currently José Manuel Durão Barroso) proposed by the European Council and elected by the European Parliament. The Council then appoints the other 27 members of the Commission in agreement with the nominated President, and then the 28 members as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament. The first Barroso Commission took office in late 2004 and its successor, under the same President, took office in 2010.
The term ""Commission"" is used either in the narrow sense of the 28-member College of Commissioners (or College) or to also include the administrative body of about 23,000 European civil servants who are split into departments called Directorates-General and Services. The usual procedural languages of the Commission are English, French and German.  The Members of the Commission and their ""cabinets"" (immediate teams) are based in the Berlaymont building of Brussels.

&gt;The **Council of the European Union** (sometimes just called the **Council** and sometimes still referred to as the **Council of Ministers**) is the third of the seven institutions of the European Union (EU) as listed in the Treaty on European Union. It is part of the essentially bicameral EU legislature, representing the executives of EU member states, the other legislative body being the European Parliament. The Council is composed of several configurations of twenty-eight national ministers (one per state). The exact membership of the configuration depends upon the topic; for example, when discussing agricultural policy the Council is formed by the twenty-eight national ministers whose portfolio includes this policy area (with the related European Commissioner contributing but not voting).

&gt;

&gt;**Correlation does not imply causation** is a phrase in science and statistics that emphasizes that a correlation between two variables does not necessarily imply that one causes the other. Many statistical tests calculate correlation between variables. A few go further and calculate the likelihood of a true causal relationship; examples are the Granger causality test and convergent cross mapping.

&gt;The counter assumption, that correlation proves causation, is considered a questionable cause logical fallacy in that two events occurring together are taken to have a cause-and-effect relationship. This fallacy is also known as cum hoc ergo propter hoc, Latin for ""with this, therefore because of this"", and ""false cause"". A similar fallacy, that an event that follows another was necessarily a consequence of the first event, is sometimes described as post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin for ""after this, therefore because of this"").

&gt;The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA), Part III, activated by ministerial order in October 2007, requires persons to supply decrypted information and/or keys to government representatives. Failure to disclose carries a maximum penalty of two years in jail. The provision was first used against animal rights activists in November 2007, and at least three people have been prosecuted and convicted for refusing to surrender their encryption keys, one of whom was sentenced to 13 months' imprisonment.

The timescale is huge and encompasses 14 years (in which a lot has happened economically speaking).

This article is specifically written to create the impression that ""ZOMG WE ARE SPENDING LOTS ON BENEFITS!"" but the reality is any plank (but apparently not telegraph readers) should be able to look at that and say ""Hang on, the economy fucking tanked in 2008 - so with lots of people out of work, the amount of people on JSA increased... and because the economy tanked, theres less money being circulated."" And thats before you add in that actually, any figures are going to be skewed even further because of our high population compared to smaller eastern or central european countries.

Anyone can see this recent economic history in the contrast between darker and lighter countries - the darker countries are countries whose economies tanked (USA, UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, etc) and the lighter ones are countries that did OK - Germany powered through it looking a bit shaky, Canada got their act together fairly well, and even France were doing ok up until fairly recently where the shit hit the fan.

&gt;And in Britain since 2010, when the Coalition came to power, spending on welfare as share of GDP has barely moved – falling by just a quarter of one per cent over three years, according to OECD data.

The increase in the number of people out of work largely balanced out by restricting the support available.

Edit: Just clicking through the pages: applying for your first adult passport redirects to renew a passport if you previously had a child passport.

Now, is this necessary? Probably not. Is £2m a bit excessive for the task at hand? Probably. Unfortunately, that's just how large bureaucracies operate. You'll find that the UK Government also spends vast amounts of money on useless crap.

But these days, anyone opposed to immigration is considered racist or xenophobic, even though it isn't necessarily BECAUSE they're of a different race.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"Owners are against building bigger stadiums because they cost a ridiculous capital outlay for the return you'll ever get back. Expanding the existing stadium typically makes far more sense if you can manage it, and even then it's not ideal. 

To just throw a figure out there, say it costs £100m to build 15,000 extra seats in the stadium (this is roughly based on cost of bringing Anfield up to 60,000 and regenerating the surrounding area being a [reported £260m](http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-fcs-anfield-stadium-cpo-6242265)). And to simplify things a bit assume that they can do that expansion over the summer months, so no matches are interrupted by the construction work and there's no period of reduced capacity - I'd say this is *very* optimistic. 

You sell those extra 15,000 tickets for £40, and you're getting £600,000 extra revenue a game assuming that they all sell out. There'll be extra overheads involved with the increased capacity - extra staff for the extra seats and turnstiles, lighting, toilets etc, so say a net £550,000 a game. At that rate to pay back the initial £100m, without including interest, you're looking at 181 matches. With 19 home games plus the odd cup ties it's probably around 8 years before the club breaks even.

Will caveat that I'm making a ton of guesses and assumptions here, but I'd say 5-10 years is probably about the ballpark for return on investment. It could cost more or less and pay back sooner or later, I actually have no idea. 

I'd say the issue for most club owners is that actually 5-10 years is a pretty long term investment before you're really looking at a solid return on it. It stacks a reasonable amount of debt for a sizeable time against the club because the initial capital expenditure is so big and you're only going to really be able to reap the rewards in 10 years' time. And there's always the possibility that something goes awry and in 10 years we lack a squad capable of producing games that fill a 60,000 seater stadium. Hillsborough is a 40k seater stadium but it's no use to Sheff Wed when they're playing in the Championship and are nowhere near filling it. 

For some extra context, our entire net transfer spending in the last five years has been around [£90m](http://www.transferleague.co.uk/league-tables/transfer-league-table-last-five-seasons.html). For that money we could have increased the stadium capacity, but then we'd have a dwindling squad and still be miles off Champions League football, which is arguably where the quick, big returns are possible. Investing in infrastructure instead of players doesn't win you trophies short term, which means it doesn't pay short term, and the longer you have to skimp on spending money on transfers the more at risk you are of dropping far away from the top and no longer filling the shiny new stadium you just built. 

tl;dr - Expanding a stadium is probably a no-brainer in the long term, but it leaves us lacking funds for the short-term squad, and unless you're guaranteed Champions League football anyway it's probably not the best return on investment for spending money unless you're looking 20-30 years ahead, which most club owners won't be.

I'm in favour of a very flexible, loose and accepting monoculture. Multiculturalism encourages ghettos, which to be fair humans naturally gravitate towards, by placing too high a value on different languages and cultures. These are walls against integration. I don't think having 7 different cultural enclaves who never talk to one another is much of an achievement beyond showing the resident population is tolerant enough to give them the space. Real tolerance comes when you have to interact with one another.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"It makes perfect sense. If I'm talking about cars, complaining whether I talked about the alloys on a BMW is irrelevant to the argument if you left the BMW out of your list of cars in the place. 

But, anyway, your argument is pretty much a misunderstanding of representative democracy. Or wilfully ignorant of how it actually works. This is why I mentioned the Council of Ministers.  The Council is full of elected members of member state executives. The idea that the EC holds complete sway over absolutely everything is flawed. The CM and the Euro Parliament are representative structures built to counter the EC. The CM has always had the real power. The reasons are both structural and political: structural because each Parliament of each state has to have the ability to influence and enact legislation ; political because the collective Executives of every nation aren't going to cede power to either the EC or the Euro Parliament. 

Thus the CM has always been the representation of the will of the people of Europe through its executives. Most Europhobes don't get this or don't understand how different ways of representation work. Representation can be be formal and informal. In the case of the CM it's informal but acknowledge - ie you don't vote for the CM but you do vote the guys on the CM by making them you leaders in a general election. 

So let's get this idiotic idea that the EC rules uber alles out of the way before it make everyone look a bit stupid. 

Moving onto the Treaty of Rome changes - the changes that were made were done because of the changes in the nature of the EU. However, there's still massive power in the CM, and it's still the primary political body in the structure that drives the EC to legislate. 

&gt;I pointed out that the voting reform brought in under Lisbon means that every single person in the UK, every minister, every MEP, and the Prime Minister himself, could all vote one way and under the new reforms it could still carry and be hoisted onto the whole of the UK.

That's a systemic argument not necessarily something that could happen. For example it's also possible for the UK parliament to pass Shariah law unhindered in the UK by virtue of a one vote majority in parliament - this is because the system is built that way. However that is going to be politically impossible - due to the nature of the political contract between parliament and the people. 

That's the case with majority voting on the CM. The changes at the Treaty of Rome were made ( and I would argue in a muddled way - but that's another debate) to enable the larger EU with a Eurozone to function. This requires all members to reconcile and adopt policy/laws across the whole EU. 

However, you've still got vetos and structures that make it really hard to actually get to a stage that you'd be faced with a forced vote - amply demonstrated by the dithering and cajolling needed to get Greece to accept the inevitable bail out.

Germans and their privacy are great though, I love that they fight for that stuff. Again, I think it's a holdover from Gestapo/Stasi and they're much more aware of the negative consequences of such an apparatus. 

Final point, I think a lot of the people on benefits/immigrant mainstream anger has really grown as a direct result of the economic downturn. People need a scapegoat, it's just how it goes.

The whole team's passing suffered vs Stoke, it was an unusual game and the weather played a part. We still need to see more of him in this role to make judgement.

I know this may be new to all the newly minted Europhobes but this European debate has been going on for a very long time. I've studied as someone who was a political science student. I've worked in it as a businessman. I deal with it daily where I teach and consult with business execs.  

The clear strategic direction of the EU was laid out in the 1980s when Mrs T was quite happily signing onto the framework for what  become the largest transfer of powers to supranational body. Everyone knew where this was heading and the entire political elite ( including some of the John Redwood Boys Academy) understood that in the long term it was going to happen. 

I welcome you to visit your local library and find copies of the economist in the 1980s. You'll find them on mircofilm, I think. You can focus around the Single European act which began changes to Qualified Majority Voting, 

The CM has always been a representative body ( I notice you don't seem to want to deal with the implication of representative democracy in your response). The CM undermines the claim that the EC is this great machine that just over rules the poor poor poor hapless Prime Ministers and Presidents of Europe thus making poor poor poor downtrodden peoples of Europe have to accept ""the Project"".

It's nonsense. The EU is a complex political system of contracts and agreements between representative democracies that have DECIDED to form a supra-national entity.

true,miomike,null,null,"My thoughts are whether we'll have ""Pochettino has left"" stories appearing in the next hour/day/week, and how much that'll fuck with us if it does happen. As for Cortese leaving, I doubt he's the only person in the world that can run a football club, deliver money and want them to do well, so overall it's more what happens to the manager now. Everyone knows swapping managers all the time is an absolute bitch for a team, and we're playing the best football we have been in years (probably in my 24 year life) so it'd be a shame to lose that. But as I've said before, if the manager is commited to the chairman and not the club or his players, then I actually don't care if he leaves. Most jobs a boss quits or changes, everyone just gets on with their job till the new one comes in and carries on after.


I think that as we're (more than likely) safe this season, whatever happens now will have little effect on our position in the PL, but instead maybe on moral and we might drop compared to rise. All depends on the manager now really, I can see him leaving because he seems to be like that, so if that happens I'd rather it happen as soon as the season ends, and that we get someone with as much attacking verve in next. TBH I'd take Adkins back in a heartbeat.


I think it is very important to remember that while Cortese set up the club to be a viable business, and also obviously helped in the creation of the team we've got, he's laid down foundations that won't just disappear because we have. The youth set up has been here for years before he was, and will continue around. The training ground that's in the progress of being built now won't just crumble because he's not there.


We also came from league 1 to the Premiership, with successive promotions, with a totally different manager to who we have now, one who before he was sacked was slowly dragging us up the table, and who the team and fans loved, so it's not like it's only Pochettino that can work wonders with these players. I don't want him to leave but I don't think we're in a particularly precarious position right now, and that gives us until the end of the season/start of next to get everything sorted out.
I'm annoyed, and sad, but don't forget, the club is pretty stable now, and I imagine we're an attractive prospect for a new buyer or a new manager if it came to it.",0,1389814734,null,0,1389822253,0,ceqczik,t3_1vada7,t1_ceqczik,t3_1vada7,null,1431956089,1,false,SaintsFC,t5_2tboa,1

Finally and most importantly for a lot of people is the history, you'd lose out on so many memories and past experiences by moving to a new stadium.

&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/10565264/Left-wing-thinking-still-prevails-in-schools.html

&gt;""I had an entire final year module devoted to The Beatles and their impact on Sixties social change, as key actors in Left-wing direct action and upheaval. The tutor, much like my teacher at school, was a huge sympathiser.
He too was a fine lecturer and we had an excellent relationship. But the fact a major section of my history degree was based on the Left-wing ramblings of John Lennon and Yoko Ono says all you need to know about the predominance of Left-wingers in our educational establishments. His specialism, for your information, a leading history tutor at one of our top universities, was 20th-century love.""

...turned up in the comments of your own article and blew your statement out of the water:

&gt; Marcus Collins, former lecturer:

&gt;**As the lecturer mentioned in the article who taught a module on The Beatles, I must take some responsibility in failing to teach the author the paramount importance of accuracy. The Beatles module is a single-semester one, not a year-long one. Colleagues will be surprised to see me identified as a ‘huge sympathiser’ regarding ‘Left-wing direct action and upheaval’. Although he read an article of mine entitled ‘The Beatles’ Politics’, he must have skipped the first paragraph, where I argue that ‘the anti-authoritarianism which formed the one consistent aspect of their political worldview was simplistic and their solutions were correspondingly unrealistic.’ It is curious that someone so averse to studying ‘the Left-wing ramblings of John Lennon’ should have chosen to write a research paper of his own design comparing Lennon to Bob Geldof.**

&gt;On the plus side, he was right that I have written about the history of love. I didn’t realise that love was a peculiarly left-wing concern, but his article gives the unfortunate impression that vitriol is a speciality of the right. It wasn’t always thus. Upon graduating last year, the article's author wrote to me that ‘I've had a great time throughout my three years and lots of that is down to you and your colleagues, so thank you.’ I don’t suppose that an article along these lines would have attracted 1600 online comments.

I do enjoy reading this article though because it does display everything I've come to love about the Telegraph bloggers being out of touch with reality.

&gt;Indoctrinating the young balances out the dominance of the Right-wing press, some have argued in response to my article. **But the Right’s dwindling influence over the media**, in the face of a publicly funded BBC and a challenging financial climate for printed newspapers, surely brings into question such a claim in the medium term.

The right's dwindling influence over the media? I must have missed it when the Telegraph (lol), the Sun, the Daily Star, The Times, The Express, The Daily Mail, The Evening Standard and Sky News all simultaneously went tits up and sank into the mire taking all the possible media influence the Right had with them.

true,grollcool,null,null,"Why do you think that many people want Mata to play? Do you think they have been following him ever since he was born? No, the reason I want Mata to play is simply because he is our best player, he plays a very attractive and effective play style and generally over the last 2 seasons, the more he played the better we were. And to make things even better he has a near telepathic connection with our best performing payer this season, Hazard. 

My interests are also at the heart of Chelsea, I do not support any one player more then the club, but the fact of the matter is that if Hazard hasnt had **individual** moments of brilliants in the last couple of games the results might be different and we might not be in 3rd. That being said, we as a team have not been playing fluent, cohesive attacking football, hell, we don't even play proper counter attacking football, we have some negative mix in between that is a slow paced passing between the center backs and defensive midfield game that leaves  a lot to be desired. And sometimes we were lucky enough to get the 3 points, other times we couldn't. I belive and so do many others that Mata is the one we need to dictate the play, Oscar is great, but for the games where we will have plenty of possession he just lacks that experience and composure Mata does, he is sooo much more useful on the counter attack, because like Mourinho said, he is a runner. pair that with his great dribbling skills and an eye for goal and we have a great setup on the break, but most our games we wont play counter attack, the opposition defense will sit back deep and play defensive, which is normal generally when against big teams, but that means no more counter attack. 

Also, even though that we have managed to scrape together points from games that we didn't necessarily play well, we are not top of the table, nor are we even second for that matter. If you look at all 3 realistic title contenders spot on the table (Arsenal, Chelsea, Man City) we are trailing both of the other two. And guess what, both of them have been playing muchh more cohesive, attractive football. They have also been scoring much much more goals, and and THEN guess what, they *BOTH* have a higher goal differential then us. So excuse me if I think that we should have certain players playing over others, but with our squad, if we are not at least second in this season, with the set of teams performing the way they are, then something isnt going right. Now, as a fan and long time supporter, I want to see a good match, a match that is attractive and entertaining, but if we have to go to more defensive tactics, in order to secure a point or to against a superior opponent in order to secure a title or trophy, I am fine with that. However, what I am not fine with is investing millions and millions of pounds to create a world class squad, and then a manager playing them like a defensive team, especially when we are both playing against lesser teams, AND have some of the best attacking midfield in the world. This isnt the group of Makelele, Drogba, Ballack, Lamps (prime), and Essien (prime) that we used to have. This is the time of Ramires, Hazard, Oscar, Mata. Small but effective players with the ball, if we want to play a counter attacking, defensive minded game, fine, then makes sure you atleast HAVE those types of players. Get two, pacey as fuck wingers, a big target man up front, and 3 engines of midfield players, and a no non sense back four. But thats not the current Chelsea, and most likely not the future one either. We should play to our strengths, not our weaknesses. 

And just to finish up, I would like to address another point that you made, you said that Mourinho sees something in training from WIllian that he doesn't see from Mata, and that should justify his inclusion or lack thereof? Can I ask what happened to Azpilicueta then. He hardly featured at all in the beginning of this season, even though he played well the season before, had he not signed a long term contract the year before you probably would have already been seeing ""rumors"" of a transfer or loan in the low level tabloids, It wasnt until we had a injury with Cole, that Azpilicueta got a real proper shot, ever since then his performances have justified him as a lockdown starter. Even until now, Azpi is favored over Cole, can I ask you why this wasn't seen in training then? Why did Cole have to be injured for Azpi to see the pitch? Hell, what would have happened if he **didnt** get injured, would Azpi be looking for a loan in this window? Who knows. All I can tell you, is that it took a injury and an impromptu inclusion into the squad for Azplicueta to show us what he could give us, and whatever it was, apparently couldn't be seen in training by Mou.

Why, if he was prepared to pay by all these methods, do you suddenly have to wait for a cash payment? This screams scam to me. All the other methods of payment have know scams attached to them. It's your sale and if you want cash on collection stick to that.

Why, exactly? The general principle is that you aren't simply allowed to hide stuff from the police. If they have reasonable suspicion, they can search your body, your car or your house.

There are all sorts of laws allowing them to force third parties to disclose relevant information. They can also search your computer. If you try to hide or destroy potential evidence when under suspicion, you're facing some very serious charges.

Why exactly should information that is encrypted have some sport of special immunity to those searches? There is some awkwardness in the similarity to self-incrimination, but really it's logically far closer to allowing the police to search something.

There's a danger of confusing this with Snowden/GCHQ/internet liberty ideas, which really isn't warranted IMO. This isn't about spying or surveillance and will not affect the everyday person - only those who are under investigation for quite serious crimes.

Now we exist in a political climate where people's trust on a legitimate issue (that of immigration levels) is completely gone when it comes to the mainstream political parties. Now we're seeing an arms race because the mainstream political parties sense a weak point within themselves because of this lack of trust.

Now, place this issue within the larger context of current British politics, that of the mass population believing that politicians are out of touch, arrogant, dishonest and self serving. It has become part of this narrative that in 2003 Labour's stance on enlargement, and subsequent dismissals of concerns (again, often legitimate) as being that of crackpots, is a reflection of an out of touch political class.

&gt;

&gt;In cryptography, **Triple DES** is the common name for the **Triple Data Encryption Algorithm** (**TDEA** or **Triple DEA**) symmetric-key block cipher, which applies the Data Encryption Standard (DES) cipher algorithm three times to each data block.

&gt;The original DES cipher's key size of 56 bits was generally sufficient when that algorithm was designed, but the availability of increasing computational power made brute-force attacks feasible. Triple DES provides a relatively simple method of increasing the key size of DES to protect against such attacks, without the need to design a completely new block cipher algorithm.

In the article Christoforos Anagnostopoulos of the Imperial College London says ""it could not explain some sex-ratio anomalies that persisted across families of all sizes, notably for mothers who were born in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan"".  However, the [Department of Health](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gender-birth-ratios-in-the-uk) lists mother's born in Afghanistan's male to female birth ratio as 105.4, *exactly* the same as England's, Bangladesh's as 102.6, *better* than Englands, and Pakistan's as 104.3, again *better* than England's.   The Independent's anaylsis is based on the 2011 census while the DoH's is based on live births between 2007-2011.  So, it looks like all three of the countries the indy singled out have, more recently, had equal or better m:f birth ratios than England.  Here's the m:f birth ratios for England &amp; Wales 1992-2012 ([source](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/taxonomy/index.html?nscl=Live+Births+and+Stillbirths#tab-data-tables)):

From this it appears that Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan's ratios for 2007-2011 aren't out of the ordinary.  Even if the independent &amp; the experts they consulted disagreed with the department of health and the office of national statistics on what would be considered an abnormally high m:f birth ratio, there are countries with similar sample sizes and a higher m:f birth ratio.

It's football, it's a sport, not fucking WWF. The team has been built largely around Mata for the past two years and we've been incredibly bad in the league, literally the worst we've been in a decade. Everything your criticising about playing negative football, being third etc., it's still a damn sight better for us as a club than going out in the group stages of the CL or losing to relegation fodder in the league over and over again. 

The counter-argument to that is we won the CL in that period - but we did it with the very negative football that you seem to detest, and also that we won the FA cup and the Europa league. Winning the FA cup is always nice, we do it often and long may it continue, but we have no place being in the Europa league. Given that we were in it I'm glad we won it, but it's still a bit embarassing to be there for 'a club of our stature'. 

It's still very early in Jose's tenure. The side is going to get stronger and stronger, the performances are going to get more commanding, though they have already been hugely improved in the two toughest matches of the season - Bayern Munich and Manchester City. 

This is not a direct criticism of Mata, but I don't think he is the best player in our system any more. He hasn't adapted well this season.

I don't have a definitive answer, but there are a few reasons in general this is done.

- if a platform is curved, the middle of the train allows a much better view than the end.

- if the train is longer than the platform, the guard may need to do selective door opening. That is, if there are doors that aren't on the platform, they don't open. Whether this applies to your stations or even if the 170 supports it I don't know.

- sometimes guards will use the door near to the platform entrance from the street / bridge. This means that after all other doors are closed, late passengers can still make a quick run for the one that's open.

Next time you see a guard do it, ask. So long as you aren't stopping them doing their duties they should be friendly enough to answer.

If an officer has grounds to search your property with a court issued warrant and you stand in the way of this - you will be arrested and charged for not cooperating with the terms of the court.

In the same way if a judge approves of RIPA action to be taken, and you stand in the way of/hinder the investigation by refusing to allow the search to take place (by giving the password) then it is the same situation.

Also, people are not always imprisoned because they are a 'danger to the public'. You can be put in prison for 'perverting the course of justice' - which doesn't necessarily make you a danger to the public...it makes you a criminal and therefore you're dealt with accordingly.

I fully agree that RIPA could be a very powerful dangerous tool if the police were able to abuse it - but it is regulated strictly and with bodies like the IPCC it cannot be used to incriminate you.

Immigration isn't a problem, you're EU citizens. Healthcare shouldn't be a worry as an EU citizen you'll have access to the [European Health Insurance Card](http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=559) which will temporarily suffice a short stay until you have to fulfil any kinds of residence obligations. This will ensure you the same rights as a citizen/resident of that country.

I don't know enough about the Netherlands to make an honest judgement on the pros and cons but what I do know is that it's generally a lot cheaper there than the UK. Something to consider (if you don't already) is the effort to learn and speak Dutch. Yes, most Dutch people speak perfectly good English but I think if you want to be a part of society there, then learning the language will go a long way.
 

Healthcare in England is generally covered by your tax contribution but provided your boyfriend has his European Health Insurance Card he should be covered for free treatment.

Even so, I am sympathetic to those on the right who feel that their opinions aren't getting fair play in academia and to the claim that some academics are pushing left-wing ideology on students.

It's a difficult issue.  I think teachers and lecturers should be able to express opinions, but I would be concerned if students were being penalized for not agreeing with their teachers' ideological leanings.

And if you don't think that's a problem- consider what happens on Reddit.  Time and again I will see comments that are clearly expressed and without insult or personal attacks be downvoted because they are suspected of expressing the wrong political point of view.  (And likely this comment will also be downvoted out of a sense of indignation because it's imagined that I'm defending a right-wing hack or whatever.)

I'm left of center BUT I am greatly concerned that some on the left have become more and more intolerant of people with different politics.  To me, part of being a liberal involves exposing yourself to viewpoints with which you disagree.

Eriksen is a shoe-in for the 10 spot. But at the same time on a lesser level holtby and siggy play best at this role. Dembele is our holding midfielder and does this well. He is a shoe-in as well. As for our wingers there's Lamela, Lennon, and Townsend. I think Lamela and Townsend should play together on the right and left respectively. Furthermore there's Paulinho who is a utility and can play almost anywhere. Sandro and Capoue are interchangibly defensive midfielders.

Dude looks at me like I'm crazy, and I realize he has no idea what Everton is, that Liverpool plays today, or probably where anyone stands in the table. I say again, ""The game today? Merseyside Derby?"" Still nothing.

&gt;  Now, as a fan and long time supporter, I want to see a good match, a match that is attractive and entertaining, but if we have to go to more defensive tactics, in order to secure a point or to against a superior opponent in order to secure a title or trophy, I am fine with that. However, what I am not fine with is investing millions and millions of pounds to create a world class squad, and then a manager playing them like a defensive team, especially when we are both playing against lesser teams, AND have some of the best attacking midfield in the world. This isnt the group of Makelele, Drogba, Ballack, Lamps (prime), and Essien (prime) that we used to have. This is the time of Ramires, Hazard, Oscar, Mata. Small but effective players with the ball, if we want to play a counter attacking, defensive minded game, fine, then makes sure you atleast HAVE those types of players. Get two, pacey as fuck wingers, a big target man up front, and 3 engines of midfield players, and a no non sense back four. But thats not the current Chelsea, and most likely not the future one either. We should play to our strengths, not our weaknesses. 

If we have to go against Bayern Munich in the CL final and we cant go toe to toe normally, playing defensive counter attack football is the right thing to do. How else could we win? 

But that should NEVER be your philosophy, especially if you want to aspire to become one of the top teams in the world. Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich.

We have as much financially backing as any of those teams, can hire the same class of managers, and attract almost the same quality of players.

&gt;and generally over the last 2 seasons, the more he played the better we were.

Just as well that's the past then. Because this season he hasn't been performing to the level of the likes of Oscar, Willian and Hazard. Why should he be playing on the pitch when those 3 are outperforming him with every game? Look, I'm just as much of a fan of Mata as you are (although I'm not sure I'd try and write a thesis to justify it) but this season he's been rightly not starting. Ultimately I support the team, not an individual player.

&gt; we as a team have not been playing fluent, cohesive attacking football we don't even play proper counter attacking football

How many games have you actually watched this season? While admittedly it's not been at a consistent level, all of those factors have been there. I wouldn't expect it to be at a consistent level yet either - due to the nature of the season being transitional and the amount of young players in the squad.

&gt; So excuse me if I think that we should have certain players playing over others

I'd rather have us winning games through good defensive work from Oscar than losing the games due to Mata's defensive side/inability to track back effectively. Mata is a fantastic player but it's no secret that that aspect of his game is lacking.


As for the rest of your post, I simply can't quite be arsed. I think Mourinho has well and truly justified his decisions so far this season and I don't think an internet comment is going to change that.

Why shouldn't it be your philosophy? Your logic there is frankly stupid. You're stating that to be a top team you have to play attractive, attacking football along with a whole load of buzzwords like 'cohesive and dominating'. No, you don't. Defending is just as much a part of the game as attacking and playing attractive football isn't a law of the game.

Those reasons are why you are the type of fan that pisses me off. Like I said before, you and the people like you who hold those views are putting undue pressure on the coaching staff, the players (especially new signings), and the owners to achieve things that we are not capable of achieving right now.

This year there are seven. We're 4th right now, but we're really only one bad weekend away from being down in 6th, and two good weekends away from being 3rd.

I think Sturridge being back and a strong home advantage against our main rivals for the rest of our season definitely plays in our favour, but I don't think we can be looking at some magical ""we just need this many points to guarantee 4th"" because this is an exceptional season and things just don't work like that anyway - United won the league with 80 points in 2010-11 and yet finished second with 89 points the very next season.

BBC - [Theresa May gets cross-party backing in Article 8 row][1] (19 June 2012)
[1]: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-18511727

&gt; MPs from all parties have accepted a government motion designed to send a clear message to judges that the right to a family life is not ""absolute"".

&gt; The government is introducing new rules spelling out how judges should apply the European Convention on Human Rights.

&gt; It is concerned too many people are using Article 8 - the right to a family life - to avoid deportation.

&gt; [...] Mrs May said the government wanted ""to give a clear message to courts about how parliament believes Article 8 should be interpreted... the stronger the voice from parliament, the better the message will be.""

&gt; Following over four hours of debate, MPs unanimously accepted the government motion.

# ` `

Article 8 summary:

&gt; * Everyone has the right to respect for their private and family life, home and correspondence

&gt; * Family life means the real existence of close personal ties

&gt; * Family life must be respected as a single entity - taking into account the rights of claimants and those with whom they claim to enjoy it

&gt; * Claimants and their families are not guaranteed the right to stay in the UK if they are able to live together elsewhere

&gt; * Private life refers to an individual's personal identity, ability to form relationships with others and physical and moral integrity

&gt; * Private life includes studies, employment, friendships and sexuality

&gt; * A claimant cannot be deported if their right to respect for private life would be completely nullified or denied in their destination country

So if you don't blink fast enough, ""family time"" will not be protected or available to UK citizens in the near future...",0,1389824069,null,0,false,0,ceqht6i,t3_1vagd9,t1_ceqht6i,t1_ceqb82u,null,1431958437,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

*a) we have small, technical players and so should use those qualities.* 


We have some small, technical players this is true. It's also true that the only one of those who isn't an exceptional athlete is Mata. 

*b) that Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Bayern Munich 'play attractive, dominating, cohesive football that is both effective and entertaining' and that we should try and be more like them.*


Firstly, there are incredible stylistic differences between the Premier League and La Liga where Real Madrid and Barcelona play. People talk about it being faster paced, more physical, and these things are true but fundamental to that difference is looser refereeing. It’s faster paced because there are fewer stoppages, it’s more physical because people are permitted to be by the referees. Not so in Spain. From this necessarily a different style of play is required. 

Secondly, Mourinho has already proven in Spain with his counter-attack based Real Madrid side - the one that took a record points total and scored a shitload of goals - that control through defence first is fine. I’m not sure why you helped me make my point here, as I can only assume you meant this Real Madrid when you mentioned them because they were mostly rubbish since they sold Makalele and they are third at the moment with Carlo. 

Tiki-taka however is not control through attack, it’s control through possession. It’s defensive possession with passing triangles and we have demonstrated time and time again over the past decade that it is vulnerable to a good team that is tactically flexible. Barcelona’s problem is that they are so incredibly ingrained in their style that they have one answer to every problem and it’s pass it side-ways, back and forward until the opponents concentration dips for a moment because they are tired and without a player like Messi, Ronaldinho, or perhaps Neymaer, it’s effectiveness is extremely questionable. Doubly so in a league where there is so much licence for physical play.

Bayern Munich have arguably the style that would be most adaptable to the Premier League. They also have a team that is completely mature in that Ribery and Robben are both at their absolute peak and are likely to dip soon. They have fantastic strikers, excellent midfielders, two of the best full backs in world football, and Neuer in goal. In short, for all that we’ve spent their squad is currently better than ours but that is largely because it is at its peak age in key areas. Still didn’t stop them being incredibly lucky to take the Super Cup from us and we beat them at their home in the CL final. Tactical flexibility is key.

*c) control through defense is inferior to control through attack - see: '... should be no reason we should have to fall back towards this type of play style ...'

This is a purely subjective argument. The fundamental issue is that control is sought, we do that very effectively now and in a way that is adapted to our league. Jose puts the team out to defend first because he is the best reactive manager in the game. If the other team is defending deep and playing for the break, we seek to control the game with safe possession. If the other team is pressing high and denying us possession we hit them on the break over and over again. If it’s not working in the first half it’s fine, because we haven’t fucked up by playing a high line with risky passing in their final third like AVB etc. There’s nothing wrong with the approach, it provides for a lot of tactical flexibility and tactical flexibility makes it extremely hard for other teams to play us. We have a starting position, and that is control or punish them for not letting us have control and then we change as needed. It’s extremely effective in the week to week grind, even if it isn’t as ‘pretty’ as some other teams. Also everything has it’s place; when we open-up and start relentlessly attacking in some of the big matches at home, we play some fantastic football.

I currently have a very basic grasp on Dutch language, though I'm taking courses here (which also provide certifications) upon completion in addition to being able to speak/write/read Dutch proficiently which will surely be helpful.

If I were to emigrate it would be more of a culture shock, but I would wish to integrate as much as I possibly can into society. If my other half moved here he would have an easier time fitting in, but work would be a barrier to either of us no matter who moved.

In terms of encryption, ""something you have"" and ""something you know function *exactly* the same - the only reason for the distinction is that they are lost in different ways and thus unlikely to be lost simultaneously.

There is no logical reason information protected by such encryption should have such a privilege just because of a practical detail on how it is stored.

That's all without addressing the fact that the right not to self-incriminate is frequently considered as obstructive and a historical accident. Saying that you shouldn't have to give out encryption because of your right to silence makes no more sense than /r/worldnews threads about the right to bear arms.

If the prosecution can't convince a jury of that beyond reasonable doubt (90%+++), then there's no offence. If they had been in storage for a year, as in your example, it would be pretty trivial to convince a jury of this. The RAID explanation and expert testimony would also likely be sufficient.

They're not allowed to do this. They would interview you under caution, you could either say or not say the password, then you would be bailed.

&gt; Oliver Drage, 19, was sentenced to four months under powers originally brought in to tackle terrorists.

&gt; His 50-character encryption key has still not been cracked by police, 17 months after his computer was seized.

&gt; Privacy campaigners say the number of jail sentences under the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act could soar, as police increasingly enforce its powers.

&gt; Drage, a takeaway worker, could have been jailed for up to five years if ‘national security’ was deemed to be at stake.

&gt; The teenager, who was not convicted of any other offences, was arrested in May last year after police investigating a child exploitation network searched his home near Blackpool.

Drage was sentenced for 4 months in prison for nothing more than not revealing his password, and was charged with no other crime, and spent all of 15 minutes in court before the decision was made.

As for the ""child exploitation"" comment, further digging shows that the police had told some journalists that was the reason for arresting him when they called in asking for more information, but they've never actually written that down on paper, and he was never charged with that or anything relating to it - some believe this was just a tactic used to relieve public pressure on the police for jailing a man simply for not telling them his password.",0,1389826885,null,0,false,0,ceqj9lc,t3_1v9tkm,t1_ceqj9lc,t1_ceqiv5s,null,1431959124,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

However if there's one thing I've noticed from my time spent looking for work, it's that there's plenty of other low-skilled minimum wage jobs in my area that I can apply for if I have to. 

I gain nothing by staying there, other than the money. I have less time to look for other jobs, I am tied down and can't commit to volunteering or work experience which might actually help me, and it has zero prospects of promotion, advancement or pay rises.

The money isn't a massive issue. I'm fairly frugal anyway. Whilst it's always nice to have more, I still live at home, and my Dad is self employed and has already said he will pay me for helping him with his business. Whilst I don't want to rely on that, it's better than going into work and being faced with the EXACT same thing day in day out.

My mind drifts off easily and it's got to the point where I can't really remember what happened yesterday at work, because it was indistinguishable from every other day.

I never stated that Romania was a bastion for sexual liberty and tolerance, but to try and equate Romania's homphobia with Pakistan's homophobia is disingenuous, same-sex relations in Pakistan are illegal and can carry a sentence of life in prison for sexual intercourse of two people of the same-sex. Whereas in Romania, Homosexuality is legal and growing minority of people are becoming more tolerant of homosexuality in society. Pakistani society is incredibly conservative and backwards, and many minorities are denied basics rights which we have in the west, such as religious freedom and various other basic human rights. Religion is ingrained in the social fabric of Pakistani society as opposed to the UK where we live in a pluralistic and secular society; the culture of Pakistan is simply flawed and behind the times, and very harmful to sexual minorities, women and other religous minorites.

With our wage structure and Shaw's desire to play for us, that would probably be enough incentive for Shaw to turn down any other suitors.

The problem with that type of game is if Shaw can't force the move, he's got 4+ more years on his contract and a stain on his reputation. For Chelsea as a club, even if Shaw was able to force a move, it would probably lead to us pissing off a club with one of the best youth systems in England.

The main anchors for that street are currently the sports centre and school. and as I have previously mentioned further along that street within the area there are a number of empty new build appartmnet /office blocks which now stand testament to suplus capacity and a stagnant economy

You have not addressed where the revenue for these stores will come from. If it is else where in liverpool then the economic impact of the stores in the long run is negative. If it generates external sources of revenue then it would be a positive. But lets be honest it wont, it will be like the Morrisons / tk maxx etc satellite park in speke. 

I would like to be wrong, and I do wish the best for the development but I cant help but feel it will be empty (for the most part) within 8-12 years.

true,DoktorStrangelove,lfcwfmm,,"If Flanagan comes back soon, I think we can get by with him as the starter at LB and Cissoko as the backup. Flanno was arguably our best player against Arsenal and he got better in every match thereafter. Sure you could bring in a more ""complete"" attacking fullback, but if you get someone from outside the PL it could easily take them the rest of the season to get comfortable in the team, so you might as well use those fixtures to give Flanagan some more experience in big matches. Now, if you're talking about signing some legitimate competition for Glen, I'm all ears. 

Personally I feel that #2 is our biggest need. Ibe could possibly provide competition and occasional rest for Sterling now that he's closer to being healthy, but we need another starting-quality winger to put in shifts down the stretch, and to allow Coutinho to play centrally and so that he can get his form back and start to improve. Lately Moses has been the first guy off the bench to slot in as a wide forward, and occasionally he has been used as a starter...that's the most glaring problem we have right now. 

Edit: Didn't really address mids...I don't know that we *really* need any more midfielders right this second unless we can snag someone with truly great potential, or possibly even a finished player of top quality. Henderson and Coutinho really seem to be going places, Gerrard and Lucas will be around a while longer probably, and Allen and Alberto are still showing lots of promise, plus we need to save room to work Suso into the team next year. Unless there's a *serious* gem for sale somewhere that can be got, I don't really see a huge need right now.

I think what I had in mind was primarilly **[this](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/12/barroso-doubt-scotland-eu-membership):

&gt;José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European commission, has thrown fresh doubt on claims by Alex Salmond that an independent Scotland would automatically remain within the EU.

&gt;Barroso said new states that hoped to join the EU would have to apply for membership in their own right, appearing to quash Salmond's assertions that an independent Scotland would inherit its share of the UK's membership.

&lt;Snip&gt;

&gt;""I am not going to speculate now about possible secessions, it is not my job. But I can tell you that to join the European Union, yes, we have a procedure. It is a procedure of international law,"" he said.

&gt;""A state has to be a democracy first of all, and that state has to apply to become a member of the European Union and all the other member states have to give their consent.""

I was under the impression that Barroso's comments as President of the European Commission was in an official capacity.  However, it seems that he was just talking out of his arse.  *(He might be right.  But if so it'll be by accident, by the look of it.)*  Interestingly when he said it it was **heavilly** reported.  When it was reported that he was just making crap up; not so much.

However, while I was checking I also found **[this](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-alex-salmond-hid-legal-reality-of-an-independent-scotlands-eu-status-9026325.html)**

&gt;In the legal clarification that has been delivered after February, Scotland is described as different from the seven countries currently waiting to join the EU. The updated legal advice for the UK Government, seen by Mr Salmond’s legal team, warns no time limit can confidently be placed on any negotiation period. And that although 18 months is a “reasonable estimate”, because the EU has not faced a situation that can be compared with Scotland’s position, the time frame could be longer.

&gt;Another key issue in the legal guidance that will further weaken the nationalists’ guarantees on Scotland staying in the EU is the need for “an accession treaty to be ratified by members”. This is described as likely to “add time” to the negotiation process.

Something else I found that is interesting though is **[this](http://newsnetscotland.com/index.php/scottish-news/8565-former-french-official-backs-scots-eu-membership-post-indy-ref)** from Sunday.

&gt;Mr Gounin said: ""Neither the Vienna convention of 1978, nor customary international law, nor strict application of EU law which submits new states to the ordinary accession procedure, and therefore to the veto of the member states, provide a simple solution.  The specific nature of the EU and common sense argue for a negotiated solution, at all stages.

&gt;""The most reasonable solution would be to negotiate the independence simultaneously and the accession to the European Union...  A negotiation of good faith would be in the interests of everyone...  The legal argument from the European Commission is not disqualifying.""

That article is peddling the comments related to the second quoted paragraph.  And he's right, it would be *reasonable* to do it that way.  The problem is that politicians in general and the EU aren't exactly big on doing things in a way that's reasonable.  One of the fairly legitimate criticisms of the EU is that it's moribund with rules that are expected to be slavishly followed.

The first paragraph pretty explicitly lays out that the existing rules don't cover the situation.  In fact it looks like there's some doubt as to the residual UK's status in the EU if Scotland becomes an independent state.  *(And stupidity like George Osborne's posturing hardly enhance the liklihood they'll look in our direction favourably or with much fondness!)*

There's an additional problem in that at various stages a number of representatives of member states have pushed the same line as Barroso.  So, if we have a situation where firstly there are simply no pre-exisitng rules for what happens, secondly the EU has a history of demanding that the rules are slavishly followed andthirdly there is some political weight behind a push to push Scotland toward making a brand-new application I'd say that makes a smooth transition less likely.

As an aside, I'm a little frustrated at how hard it is to actually get any solid information on this.  You have both sides taking the same piece of vague information and claiming that it clearly shows their diametrically opposed views are right.  The lack of transparency and honesty is appalling.

It's unfortunate that the World Cup is this summer, I don't think we'd be having these issues if it was 2015. It also makes no sense that they've already signed Sherwood to a contract (I know they can terminate it but it's still a gesture of faith) when a bunch of senior players are clearly frustrated with the change.

It just seems to me like there is a huge disconnect somewhere between management (whether it's Sherwood, Levy, or who knows) and players which is never a good thing in a team sport. Everyone has been saying 'The club needs time, the players have to mesh together' which is completely valid, SO WHY IS IT ALL BEING BLOWN UP?

true,cathalhenry,,Belfast,"Thanks. I was genuinely curious, as I have my own assumptions of the Alliance Party, but never really took the time to have a proper look at their policies and ideological outlook.

I like the idea of a non-partisan party, though I've always associated the Alliance Party with the status quo, or unionism by default. I grew up as a working class republican, though I've since developed my own views. My own philosophical outlook would steer towards democratic socialism, so Sinn Fein, or the Green Party would seem to be a more natural fit. That said, Sinn Fein's history is obviously a sticking point. One not helped by the likes of Gerry Kelly's Castlederg speech. Weirdly, in the south, they seem like a much more attractive prospect than they do up here.

Alliance, by their own admission, see the LibDems as a sister party. This has perhaps been the biggest sticking point for me. The LibDems are hardly the worst, but they are a capitalist party. Socially liberal, yes, but also economically. I wondered if this was also true of Alliance.

I do like some of the noises NI21 are making. Not being a unionist, I doubt I'd ever vote for them, but they seem a much less reactive party. I should clarify that I'm not a republican simply because of family history, or ludicrous tribal affiliations. I'd just rather be part of a small, neutral nation, with a written constitution enshrining the rights of the people, than what I see to be an old imperial nation, still competing for power and resources, often violently.

Anyway, I think I've rambled my way off topic. Sorry about that. I've voted for the Greens in the past. I may take a closer look at Alliance, though I hope they'll eventually support a border poll, if only to give us all a democratic say in our constitutional future.

2013 was a big year for Who. We had a big budget 8 episodes, the 50th and the regeneration.

Now Time of the Doctor was intended to resolve all of the loose threads and plot holes from Matt tenure as The Doctor, which it did. It was a lot to fit into an episode. It also aimed to fix the regeneration limit, which again it did. Obviously Moffat and Matt wanted to end the year with the regeneration, so that when Peter's first series started he hasn't got all these unresolved plot lines. He can start fresh, it'll be a jumping off/jumping on point. 
 
Because of the amount of money pushed into the show this year they could only afford to have one episode for Matt's goodbye, instead of the two that David got. Also from a narrative standpoint I guess Moffat couldn't see a two parter working.

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"My point was this: Papers struggle to find 4 cases in which people have been prosecuted and jailed under this legislation. It is used sparingly, in the most serious of cases, as was intended under the RIPA legislation governing it's use. (note that RIPA restricts investigatory powers! Much like PACE cleaned up Police Powers and regulated what the police can and cannot do in investigations).

There are checks and balances in place that make the scenario you envisage near impossible. How can you have reasonable belief that a person has the encryption key to a USB stick if that person is vehemently denying ever having seen it?

Likewise, if I wanted rid of you, I could just plant an unencrypted USB with child porn on you. Does that mean that the laws against Child porn are wrong, because a nefarious person could misuse them?

Whilst I'm no fan of 'forcing' people to disclose information, I do see the need for this legislation. In many ways it's an endorsement of the power of strong encryption.

Like it or not, there are people out there using encryption technology to hide and protect serious criminality. Without this kind of legislation, we lose the ability to deal with a large sector of criminality.

Policing concerns itself with the balance between individual freedoms and societal responsibility on a daily basis. Any officer charged with an investigation involving encrypted data will be in a continuous decision making process: Is doing this necessary, proportional, justified? Do I believe that this is the correct way to progress. Don't forget, if they get it wrong their career or freedom in extreme cases would be on the line.

Legislation like this is very scary if you believe the police to be jackbooted stormtroopers vested in protecting the states agenda (or perhaps their own private one). Since the UK police are NOT that, and not only RIPA but many other seemingly sweeping and draconian laws are used appropriately and sparingly, I personally don't have a problem with it.

I tend to agree, however, that this particular law should probably be overseen by a magistrate, much like a warrant. Why it isn't is down to the law makers.

true,AyCarrumba,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I imagine that the situation in the UK is somewhat different because I've been a Police Officer for over a decade. The US police are allowed to lie, to misrepresent evidence, to trick confessions (I assume you've seen the same video 'Do not talk to police' that I have - the 'sorry letter' to a victim of burglary as a particularly unpleasant example) and there are also a number of very odd offences about lying to police that they can enforce even if you are simply trying to help them, but are mistaken.

Many of their methods make my teeth curl, as an investigating officer, and I would not be prepared to use them. Where police are encouraged to use unethical methods to secure convictions, and where plea bargaining in the face of incredibly draconian sentencing means that many people do not get their opportunity to have a case heard, since the stakes are just too high, I think it's sensible to be highly cautious of the Police.

Where the Police are tightly regulated, where much of the legislation they operate under is concerned with protecting the rights of a suspected person and preventing wrongdoing by police (quite rightly), and where the police operate on a model of operating with the community, not acting against them, I think it's very dangerous to advocate a stance of 'Never speak to the Police'. The police in the UK actually want to do a good job, and help people, but it no-one talks to them, ever, then it becomes impossible.

I'd always advocate getting legal advice as a suspect, but to 'never talk to police' be it as a witness, suspect, or interested party? That's not helpful to anyone.

I don't think they tied the loose ends quite well. 

They simply reintroduced the Crack on the wall arch and the whole ""Silence Will Fall"" and The Question (""Doctor Who?"") along with fighting all his enemies at the same time, without the TARDIS. 

And then at the end, the Time Lord's Deus Ex Machina is simply unimaginative. Implying a bunch of mechanics that never existed before (a curse that haunts many Doctor Who Finales).

You are correct, it was a mess and it was too much to put into one episode. Because the characters' reaction to the events were basically unexistant (which I think Moffat sometimes uses to incite mistery, although this time it simply incited confusion, considering how little consideration they took in their life-changing decisions).

They did not need to reopen so many ambiguosly closed doors. Their decision to do so lead to an episode which would have needed at least 2 hours of screen time.

And worst of all: it was all boring. A lot of neat lights near the end, but so shallow it felt like the final episode of Lost being directed by Michael Bay.

For these reasons I declare this episode to be the worst of 2013 and perhaps of all time.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17286328

&gt; Real freedom of information is about ""the money that goes in, the results that come out"", as opposed to ""FOI requests that are all about processes"".

&gt; That's the view of [the PM], which he expressed yesterday at the end of his evidence session in front of a House of Commons committee.

&gt; He distinguished between the increased transparency that derives from the publication of data (such as crime maps, local government spending and public sector contracts), which he is enthusiastic about, and what he called ""the endless discovery process"" of responding to FOI requests, which clearly doesn't appeal to him quite so much.

&gt; It's not the first indication that [the PM] is becoming ""the heir to Blair"" in his attitude to freedom of information. We've already had reports of remarks in which he's said that due to FOI, ""officials and ministers are increasingly reluctant to put on paper what they actually think"".

&gt; [The PM's] stance can be seen as an illustration of what one international academic authority on FOI, Professor Al Roberts, has called ""executive pushback"" - attempts by political leaders to counter or undermine FOI laws.

*[Aside] You are encouraged to read for better context of the situation from Q429.*

Q438 [PM]

&gt; [...] I have to say that in my experience of two years, and the Freedom of Information Act and all the rest of it, it seems to me that real freedom of information is the money that goes in and the results that come out. Making government more transparent is the best thing. We spend an age-fortunately not me, but the system seems to-on dealing with FOI requests that are all about processes, but what the public, the country and Parliament need to know is how much money are you spending, is it being spent well and what are the results. I think we have approached, as a country, the wrong end of the telescope. What we are doing now includes the publication of the contracts; the publication of the outcomes; the publication of the information. You can go on a crime map; you can see where the crimes are being committed; you know how much the police are spending; you know where they are spending it; and you can break down local government spending to the last £500. That is freedom of information, but this endless discovery process that furs up the whole of Government-don’t worry, we are not making any proposals to change it.

Q439 [PM]

&gt; [...], but I would rather we went down the track of saying, ""What are the data we need published?"" rather than changing the Freedom of Information Act. I will go away and consider that point, but I think that publication of information is better than the discovery process, which I think furs up the arteries on occasions.

Q440 [Chair of Inquiry]

&gt; If you are not going down the road of your predecessor Tony Blair, you may be making an offer to come to the Justice Committee and explain your views on freedom of information.

Q440 [PM]

&gt; Hopefully I skirted around that, so as to avoid that invitation.

---

With the inclusion of [/u/apple_kicks][1]' important link: ""[Police fix crime statistics to meet targets, MPs told - BBC][2]"", is it truly ""freedom of information"" to say that ""the publication of the contracts; the publication of the outcomes; the publication of the information"" are the only things we need to get the full story of what happens and goes on within the country?

I think TrueCrypt's technique is better, as the internal encrypted volume is indistinguishable from blank space in the external volume, even when the external volume is decrypted - there's absolutely no way to prove the internal volume exists.

If Assange's method became widespread, it would be impossible to tell whether a volume had more than one password, leaving room for them to argue you're withholding information.

I'm lucky in regards to the fact that I'm a 3rd generation Caribbean which essentially means I'm just a person of colour whose home is the U.K. Learning English was never a problem for me but for anyone who is living in the U.K. and has a majority of their native language being spoken in the home and inner community then English lessons are essential. 

I do feel that the word multiculturalism is quickly becoming a tainted word as we all seem to have separate definitions for it. Under the definition you've laid out with the Jewish example I wouldn't call those people English either but again I feel like it's poor integration rather than multiculturalism at work.

It has been fairly common practice and encouraged by advisors in the parliamentary sports commitee.

In fact they praised Abramovich for doing this at Chelsea, as it removes the danger of individuals calling in their loans to the club at short notice.

I know it's from the daily mail, but another example is Al Fayed at Fulham.

Therefore FSG can get money directly into the club without increasing debt.

Given that the BBC uses what is called 11 day Fortnights to film the program (11 days on, 3 days off between filming episodes) it will take them 6-7 months to film all of the episodes, then it will take another 3-4 months to do the post production work for each episode.

By the definition you provided: 

A plot device whereby a seemingly unsolvable problem is suddenly and abruptly resolved by the contrived and unexpected intervention of some new event, character, ability or object. Depending on how it is done, it can be intended to move the story forward when the writer has 'painted themself [sic.] into a corner' and sees no other way out, to surprise the audience, to bring the tale to a happy ending, or as a comedic device.

The problem: Regenerations running out.

The solution given: Extra regenerations come unexplained along with the power to defeat all the daleks.

Where did the solution come from? The Time Lords? They have that kind of power? It was never suggested.Who had to guess that he needed it? How could Clara have told them? They are not in great terms with the Doctor. They should have been portrayed making the decision.

In reality, moving between countries is a hugely stressful experience, involving moving your entire life across borders, leaving your home town, a familiar environment, and entering an entirely unfamiliar one. Most migrate here *because* they want to work or study, not because they think that they'll magically get given a house and money by the government.

In regards to 'takin' err jerrbs', most of these fears come from areas where there is already little work available, and unsurprisingly, those immigrants who come over seeking work don't tend to move there; if you're already upping sticks and shifting countries, why would you move to an area of the country where you're *less* likely to find a job?

I dont see why he couldn't bring us to Europe, huge squad potential and all, and keep us competitive at the very least. I'm not really worried about his management skills-CL success on a scale like that should tell us about how good he is at motivating players. I'm.a Bielsite too! There are a few problems that I'm not sure would fix itself quickly enough in such a competitive league like the EPL. Something like putting creative mids at left back being the most glaring. His Chile work is Bielsa at his very best. Problem with both? They're old, plain and simple. Bielsa would be my first choice if he wasn't close to sixty, and LvG is 62. Enter Murat Yakin. Kept a young FC Basel side competitive in CL (See Chelsea victory), looks like he plays an attacking game and loves midfielders. He's not the theoretical mind that Bielsa is, but 39 makes him very appealing for me. In a league where a manager can expect a sacking in 2 tears or less, I would love if Yakin became something of a Wenger or Ferguson. Knowing Levy though, ehhh. Van Gaal is the most practical choice for what we're looking for in the short term (I dont think he'll stick around for more than 5 years) Bielsa I love as a choice, but man management is piss poor. Yakin seems like the safest option for me l- imagine if LvG got one point off of fourth and got the axe. How would Tottenham look if they fire someone of his caliber? Imagine the rap we'd get. Levy will be known as the hardest chairman in the league to please, so there goes the young managers who are looking to make their name for a few good years with the club. Yakin, in all honesty, is the safest for me. Young, experienced with young sides, CL experience, imagine what he'd do with Tottenham when he was on a shoestring budget in comparison to a top 5 PL team. I'd love Bielsa though. His Chile stuff is massively fun. Yakin, though, would be outstanding. ",0,1389845137,null,0,false,0,ceqrqkl,t3_1vbt3f,t1_ceqrqkl,t1_ceqosu8,null,1431963180,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Just look at how we treated other cultures during the days of the British Empire. Even if we're limiting it to immigration, the UK had immigration related race riots back in 1919, and even after the Race Relations Act in 1965, which outlawed public discrimination, racism was still present, and it's generally shifted its main focus towards different groups of people over as their migration levels peaked, whether they were Irish, Indian, Pakistani, Polish, or Romanian. The Irish were often discriminated against for a good portion of the 20th century, and an influx of people coming from India and Pakistan in the 1970s kicked up the same kind of fuss you see in the papers now. Racism towards there was racism in the 70s, during the economic downturn in the 80s, there were major riots that were tied to racism, and there have been even in the last 15 years you've lived here, across the country.

But their regularity seems to have died down somewhat. Despite the most recent economic downturns, major events like those above seem to be occurring with less regularity, and the type of culturally engrained casual racism that used to occur seems to have dropped too.

Of course, if the only thing you go by is newspaper headlines, you're going to be in for a bad time.

I'm on O2/Sky broadband and received a confusing bill which listed charges for 3 weeks of the previous month (from the handover in late Nov- to mid Dec) as well as one full pre-charged month (mid Dec- mid Jan). I was initially outraged that they'd billed me twice as much for one month, but because of the crappy layout of the bill I just hadn't realised it was listing two months.

As for the 'supplementary' charges - **I'm not being charged a penny extra**, they're just a cunning way of advertising Sky's discounts to induce me to use their other services. e.g. I'm told I have one £5 'supplementary charge' for not having Sky Talk, and another £5 charge for not having Sky TV. If I get Talk (which I am; fuck BT), my monthly broadband bill will just be a fiver cheaper. Were I to get both (I'm not getting the TV) then it would be a tenner cheaper. 

It's just a sly way of advertising possible discounts if you choose to buy into more Sky services. I had a suspicion it would blow back in their faces when most people didn't take time to closely read the bill.

edit: Actually, Sky are charging me less than O2 were: it's now £15/mo down from £18. Their excellent tech support also boosted my speed up by 3 megs when I was experiencing line problems last week.

In my opinion, we have been right on the verge of finishing in the top 10 for the past several years, we have really been lacking a Central Midfielder (either deep lying or CAM) to just simply pull the strings. I agree we have big forwards and good wingers who can whip in good crosses, but i really think what we lack is someone to tie all of the play together and spray balls through to forwards or put wingers in advanced positions to get those crosses in.

A central player who can get everyone else lots of touches in both comfortable positions of possession as well as counter attacking/ build up attack would do wonders for us, and knowing when is the right time to do one or the other. I agree with advisorybored that it is very frustrating to watch the ball go to Benteke without much success, and while i have lots of faith in Delph and Westwood, i think that one dominant central player can bring out the best in both of them (as well as the rest of the squad)",0,1389849784,null,0,1389851677,0,ceqtnhm,t3_1vaiu3,t1_ceqtnhm,t3_1vaiu3,null,1431964235,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1
