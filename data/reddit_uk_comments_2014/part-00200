This is my opinion, alternatives accepted!
 
Season 1 - Chris Eccelston 
The important episodes are...

1.1 Rose - First episode of the series. Introduces the Doctor
1.9 - The Empty Child - Introduces Jack Harkness, a recurring character and lead in the spinoff series Torchwood, also a great episode.
1.10 - The Doctor Dances - 2nd part of two part Jack Harkness story
1.12 Bad Wolf (Part 1)
1.13 The Parting of Ways (PArt 2) - Davidson's last episode. 
 
2005 Special
2.x The Christmas Invasion - David Tennant's first episode. 
 
Season 2
2.1 - New Earth 
2.4 - The Girl in The Fireplace - Lot's of time travel. A fan favorite
2.12 Army of Ghosts (Part 1) - First part of the season finale.
2.13 Doomsday (Part 2)
 
Season 3
3.10 Blink - One of my all-time favorites
 
Season 4
4.3 Fires of Pompeii - Peter Capaldi, the next Doctor, plays a big role.
4.6 The Doctor's Daughter - A standard episode, but fun because David Tennant ended up marrying the actress who plays the Doctor's 'daughter' who happens to be the actual daughter of Peter Davidson, the Fifth Doctor. 
4.9 Silence in the Library (Part 1) - Sets up important characters for the rest of the series. I like this episode a lot.
4.10 Forest of the Dead (Part 2)
4.11 Midnight - One of my favorite episodes
4.16 The Waters of Mars - A great one.
 
Season 5 
5.1 The Eleventh Hour - First appearance as Matt Smith as the 11th Doctor
 
At this point, I'd just watch the rest of the episodes. You've got a while until a new season starts.

Capaldi's Doctor does seem a little bit colder -- there's still the mystery of whether he did push that cyborg out and who Missy is and why she calls the Doctor her ""boyfriend."" I read somewhere that Missy/Michelle Gomez's character is also known as the gatekeeper of the nethersphere... No doubt some will speculate that Missy is another incarnation of River Song...

... and who posted that ad? Was it 11? Clara was his Impossible Girl. Or was is the mystery baddie -- the Master?

I guess it was a bit jarring for Clara to see an ""older"" Doctor because when she went into the Doctor's timeline, she could see him basically get younger with each incarnation... and I loved that as Capaldi was talking to the cyborg, he was also sort of talking to himself... Can't wait to see the CGI'd/cleaned-up version. There was also a little easter egg there when he was talking to the tramp about how stupid a big scarf would be... 

That bit at the end where he asks Clara to ""see him"" was a message to the fans. It was touching. He's still the Doctor, after all but it's hard to let go of Matt after the 50th Anniversary and Christmas specials and the last 4 seasons.

- EU citizens don't needs visas, but you may need to state your intention to stay depending on your country of origin. The uk government website should have the details.
- There are large shopping centres (malls) throughout the UK. You shouldn't find it too much of a shock.
- I would seriously recommend contacting a bank and getting a UK account setup. Nationwide are a good bet.
- Rent first - buying property in the UK is a protracted and complex process and is harder for non-UK citizens.
- Broadcast journalism is probably one of the most competitive professions in the UK. As we have few local TV stations (and radio is very small scale) the number of opportunities is extremely limited. A degree is usually a requirement for entry these days, though there are less conventional routes in. Internships do exist but are heavily competitive, and I'd be surprised if you got one without a relevant degree.

&gt;it is not massed tanks on the European mainland we need, but the latest in cyber warfare, unmanned aircraft technology and Special Forces capability.

&gt;That is what we are investing in today. The majority of the money - £800 million – is being spent on intelligence and surveillance equipment. 

I don't see any terrorists in the sky, and they certainly can't terrorise anybody over the internet, so what the fuck is £800million in drones (bet they're US drones) going to achieve??

&gt;It includes the latest in cyber defence technology and surveillance aircraft that can fly over areas like the Horn of Africa, identifying any terror threats to the UK and our allies.

Why are you spending £800million to fly drones over *AFRICA*? Who gives a fuck about africa!

&gt;But the plain fact is that in the 21st century, you cannot defend the realm from the white cliffs of Dover.

""the realm""? Somalia is the realm is it? Can I go there?

&gt;Trying to build a 21st-century armed forces out of a stack of I.O.U notes must rank – in a competitive field - as one of the biggest scandals of their time in Government.

No, the biggest scandal of our time is fucking over everybody* in the country so that you can buy drones to patrol third world countries!

true,ellejayess,null,null,"&gt;Am I just being a cynical old dick? I didn't have a problem with a big pool of sentient plastic, or a werewolf etc, so why does seeing so much overuse of CG upset me so much?    

Nah, you're not alone in this. For one thing, CGI and its overuse is bothering people outside of the community, as evidenced by that recent thread that compared and contrasted LOTR vs. The Hobbit, and the thread that linked to the Onions review of Planet of The Apes and its bazillion CGI monkeys. Dr. Who's CGI will likely continue to be a bit jarring until the TV/cinema world gets a proper handle on how and when to use it.    
As for Matt smith, I concur that his fun was often jarring (such as being too flippant about the safety/fate of his companions): but maybe that's being addressed now with the darker tone, if the new doctor is one who asks himself whether he's a good man. That introspection might shift the tone of the show back to its roots.      
In terms of the future of the show: I've very much enjoyed what has been done in episodes such as the anniversary ep, where the show seemed more knowing, self-conscious and aware of its audience. That worked for me. My main concern about the future of Dr. Who actually pertains to the save the world/save the universe/save all time plot cancer, where there's the tendency to always escalate the scale of the threat the way Hollywood does (e.g. the tendency for movies to increasingly choose plotlines where the whole fate of a world is threatened, instead of focusing on more localised struggles). Since that escalation should be unsustainable, hopefully there will be a good number of episodes that deal with smaller events and experiences, rather than grand narratives. Such episodes would feature less action, and therefore be less CGI-centric.",0,1405322273,null,0,1405322616,0,ciwvojs,t3_2amqfu,t1_ciwvojs,t3_2amqfu,null,1434705522,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

/u/sb452 is absolutely correct in what they say about how 'classes' work in the UK system, and whilst I know of no one doing this Management Studies course (in fact I'd never heard of it), the general stereotype is that if you switch your course for the final year, you're probably doing it because you couldn't cut it or lost interest in your original course.

What I'd say above all else is this; don't make plans for your third year before you're even a fresher! I haven't the slightest clue what I want to do in third year and I'm about to start second year. I would certainly say that there's no way to make an educated decision about such a big change before coming to Cambridge. Try your course, talk to your Director of Studies, see what you like. I wouldn't be at all surprised if you changed lots of plans you'd made previously after actually being at Cambridge for a term. 

Also, I'll comment on another question you've been asking around the thread, about whether some papers (or 'classes' as you call them. They're often referred to as 'papers' because for each 'class' you do, you will sit an exam - or a paper - and so the entire class is referred to as a paper) are easier than others. In my experience in History having sat two papers now, yes you'll find some papers easier than others, and yes objective difficulty does have a part to play, but...
...The things I'd stress are these: How easy you find a particular paper will be much sooner dependant on your particular strengths and interests than the simple difficulty of the paper, and even if there is a significant difference in difficulty between papers, you might not find out until after you've started and are committed.

Unnecessary!) but I was hoping for a fresh start.

(For reference, my preference: I've always held seasons 3 through 5 as my favorites, that 11 peaked with his first season and 10 was best in his latter two.)

I did enjoy the madame de pompadour reference, and the Amy reference, and the scarf, and I enjoyed that they made Clara seem more vulnerable / flawed / more interesting a character to watch (not to mention her acting was spot on), but I guess the entire premise of the episode was the Doctor trying to regain Clara's confidence even though we've seen him do NOTHING to lose it, especially not the viewer's. So what if he's got an old mug? She's seen him with an old mug before. If he betrayed her in some way and left her brokenhearted and abandoned at the end of this episode, and then the rest of the season was about discovering whether things would be patched between them, that'd make sense. But as is, me being the fan that's watched so many seasons of the show, -of course- I'm going to trust the Doctor, -of course- he's essentially the same good guy underneath, so that eliminates all the emotional tension from the episode.

I'm not a fan of the Vastra gang, so I guess that's not helping either.

It was probably the most bizarre trophy presentation I've ever seen. I think it was decided on Thursday that the match was to be for a trophy as some local garden centre (or something similar agreed to sponsor it).

Pretty difficult to evaluate players from friendlies so it's cautious optimism I've taken. Guidetti looked dreadful though (if you want to loan him to us then I'd still take him).

It's difficult to watch a film set here without picking out things like accents and what have you. Gillian Anderson had a decent accent in The Mighty Celt but everything she said had the exact same intonation for every sentence. I haven't seen Good Vibrations yet, though I would like to very much.

Mickybo and Me was a nice tread through some familiar locations, but that in itself causes issues for people from here who watch it I think - it's hard to switch off and not say ""oh I've been there, oh look there's Donaghadee, wait a second that's Carrickfergus not Belfast"". It's also a little hard to watch because it does the whole ""across the divide"" thing that seems to sell so well.

I really enjoyed Hunger, mainly because I like some films that are a bit artsy. It wasn't obvious about pushing the locations in your face either in the way some other films are.

I liked the whole ""let's go to Antrim"" bit in Hellboy II, but that's neither here nor there, as it were.

I would recommend either Sky or Virgin Media in terms of fibre optic internet, but bear in mind not all areas in the UK have access to fibre broadband. 

If you are looking for a cheaper tv and internet package and not too bothered about what tv channels you would get, I would put my money on Virgin. 

Sky is a little more expensive but you get more channels for your money. Talktalk can provide phone and internet plans without a TV package. You will have to pay for a landline to be installed and a monthly charge is added, roughly £12 - £15 per month. 

Mobile phone provider, 3 tends to lean towards texting rather than calling and their coverage is average. But if you go over your planned data / minutes / texts etc, then their charges are atrocious!

Personally, I would opt for orange or Vodaphone. They both provide great coverage and their phone deals are quite reasonable. I would get a postcode to where you are moving to and do a coverage check (available on Vodaphone.co.uk or orange.co.uk)

A simple example would be that someone working in a cleaning office in some-place in cheap part of Cornwall, will have accommodation costs that are a fraction of the CEO who is living in London.  Actually accommodation is a great example of this.  My flat costs per square metre about £2,580k (120sqm, £310k) my parents property, including garden and land is about £120 (2900sqm, £350k).  If we looked at price per sqr meter, my parents are worse off by about 20 times!  This is the difference between land in the outer zone 4 part of London too.  Does this mean my life is 20 times better?

There are many things which are fungible, only to certain limits put on, accommodation is a great example of this, because whilst just looking at the properties my parents is certainly better (more rooms, garden space, the rooms are bigger etc) it's not really fungible because the commute would be around 5+ hours each way.

There are similar pages for 3G if necessary. If you really want a contract asap then check out the coverage on these sites.

- There are only two large fibre (or cable) internet providers - Virgin and BT. Both have limited coverage. ADSL broadband is still more common, although fibre is catching up. If you can't get fibre where you live, then you'll have to get ADSL, in which case your provider won't make any difference to the speed of your service as they all use the same infrastructure - you'll want to pick your ISP based on price, customer satisfaction and Ts and Cs.

furthermore,  by far most beggars ARE scammers whole already have somewhere to live - I used to live in York which has a particular problem with them, and the councils own figures show that 85% of beggars are claiming benefits. (the source for this is printed on donation boxes [like this poster](http://www.saferyork.org.uk/uploads/photos/83.jpg)

If you want to genuinely help the poor, give your money to a charity that helps them, not to people in the street, where 7 out of 8 of them are taking the piss. You can even buy them food, drink etc - but giving them money just makes their situation worse, not better.

to futher my point - here's the FAQ page on begging from homeless charity Thamesreach http://www.thamesreach.org.uk/news-and-views/campaigns/giving-to-beggars/faq/

&gt;Most people who beg have accommodation. Outreach workers can help those who don't to access a hostel bed. 

and [heres](http://www.bristol.gov.uk/page/our-city-news/2012-12/giving-beggars-harms-them-warn-streetwise-staff) a Bristol charity saying that 
&gt; Giving to beggars harms them, warn Streetwise staff 
&gt; giving beggars money can stop them from taking help and will probably fund drugs or drink.

&gt; “There is overwhelming evidence that shows that people who beg on the streets do so in order to buy hard drugs and super-strength alcoholic beers and ciders,” said Stuart Pattison, who oversees the project for the Safer Bristol Partnership.

The people who genuinely need help will not be sat near a station in rush hour asking for money, they'll be the one in charity housing doing what they can to get out of their situation. They wont be the ones sat on tower bridge in brand new trainers that I see daily during rush hour but are never there outside those times, they'll be the ones that charities like Shelter genuinely help feed and house.


Yes, we should be helping people in need. i'd encourage everyone to do so - there's charities like [shelter](http://england.shelter.org.uk/get_involved) and [Crisis](http://www.crisis.org.uk/pages/support-us.html) who you can help in many ways and be sure your money and effort is going to those genuinely in need.",0,1405331766,null,0,1405333754,0,ciwxiog,t3_2anjwt,t1_ciwxiog,t3_2anjwt,null,1434706366,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

true,wrothish,silence,Silence,"&gt;  I guess the entire premise of the episode was the Doctor trying to regain Clara's confidence even though we've seen him do NOTHING to lose it, especially not the viewer's. So what if he's got an old mug? She's seen him with an old mug before.

I don't think it's 12's face that bothers her. I think she's concerned about what that face means. It's just too weird otherwise because she's the companion who threw herself into every facet of his past. 

I attributed her feeling that their companionship was in upheaval to his centuries without her on Trenzalore. She is reunited with him shortly before he's recharged wearing 11's aged face, sees him briefly with his youthful one before regeneration, and then he appears with a new aged face. 12 runs off with absolutely no indication he intentionally left Clara with Vastra &amp; Co. 

It's always hard to fully sell ""companion doubting the Doctor,"" but I think Clara has enough of an understanding of his long path to know he does change, companionships end, and seeing both 11 and 12 with aged faces as they act quite independently of her carries those questions into this episode.

The landlord has all the power and agency to ignore your rights and break the law, and the tenant has very very little recourse. This is not set to change. A simple example: read a housing contract. Most of the time, much of the contract is legally unenforceable.

The solution presumably is that a class of 'better' landlords who operate more socially conscious come to the forefront as happy tenants = more rent = more profit, but this hasn't happened. It seems to be better business to cheat and lie and unfortunately the industry knows this. The market simply reverts to the most profitable mode of business, as it has always done.

We don't need to legislate the hell out of renting, what we need to do is make it more profitable to operate ethically and responsibly rather than exploit tenants and ignore the law. And we have done this for other industries and had decent results, so it's not an impossible feat.

Not all Muslims are violent people, clearly.  However there are a worry amount of young men and women that have, as you say, become involved in the Syrian and ISIS conflicts (amongst others), who have a stated goal of attacking innocents in the UK and other nations.  

Clearly there is a problem in the Muslim community.  When we see the results of market research in the UK returning results such as: 

*  46% of UK Muslims believe ""the Jewish community in Britain is in league with the Freemasons to control the media and politics

*  78% of British Muslims support punishing people who publish cartoons mocking the Prophet Muhammad.

*  A 2009 Gallup survey could not find a single UK Muslim who approved of homosexuality.

*  1 out of 3 British Muslims aged 16 to 24 believe that Muslim apostates should be executed.

In 2012 pension funds owned less than 5% of UK issued shares. And even if it was a much larger proportion the people who have the most invested in their pension funds are the wealthiest. I wonder where this 'shareholders = pensions = all of us' argument came from?

I believe Sky mostly use what was BE kit for ADSL access and BTs network where BE didn't have kit or for FTTC connections, so their speed should be identical to that of BT for 99% of people. I've not had Sky for internet access so don't know what their customer service is like for that, but I've never been impressed on the TV side of things. Price for pure internet looks similar to BT/Zen/Plusnet/etc - bundled with TV and other services it may work out cheaper.

From a practical point of view as a tenant, I've noticed than when I've checked out of properties since this scheme has been in place, the agent has been there and agreed what's right/wrong before I handed over the keys. On one occasion they weren't happy with the state I'd left the oven in, so they gave me two hours to clean the oven (which I did), and I got all my deposit back. I dare say that without the DPS in place, I'd have been charged £250 for a cleaner to clean the oven. I've had to pay extortionate cleaning fees when checking out of other places before DPS, which I left spotless.

As a landlord, I've never had a reason to withhold a deposit (although I did threaten to once) so it hasn't affected me directly - but I'm sure there are some dodgy landlords who aren't too happy about it.

Whichever Bristol charity came off with ""Giving to beggars harms them,"" is talking out of their asshole.

Generally it's easy to replace someone for a job which requires pretty little skill, like data inputting for example. And therefore they can offer low wages because the difference in skill between workers is small and they will work for it.  
  
The only way wages will rise properly is when things get too expensive for people to buy, and therefore employers have to raise wages in order to ensure that their staff can afford to purchase shit to make sure they make money - and as the record profits are telling us that's not gonna happen any time soon. The only other method is raising the minimum wage but that doesn't help the majority of workers anyway.

[We fielded a pretty complete team](http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25531987) and got rolled over like we were Brazilian. Fair enough it was only a cup tie, but that was our one brush with Premier League opposition last season and the game still had some weight.

Another factor to consider is the adjustment to the wage budget and the sum they have in reserve to actually put towards new players. While we aren't lumbered with the salaries of the likes of Luke Young, AJ and Park, we're not exactly in a position to exchange like for like. A lot of the money that has been freed up is just working us back towards a more 'sensible' (if such a thing exists in the PL) wage bill. Throw in the fact that Remy and Taarabt's ~100k/week are still our responsibility, SWP and Cesar are surely going to mug us off continuously and Barton, Hoilett and Onuoha must all be handsomely paid too...I'm not sure we're in a position to be handing out £42k a week to the likes of Caulker willy-nilly.

Here's another scenario/monday morning office fantasy - the club ends up spending very little, brings in 2/3 players and accepts that relegation is a given, but over the next 4 years ends up being a bastion of financial common sense, even breaking even at the season's end, with youngsters getting a chance and the squad competing for promotion with modest financial doping from the parachute payments.

We want long-term immigrants to integrate into UK society. Asking them to pay for services such as schools or the NHS through their taxes and then denying them the use of these services not only seems unfair, it would create a very divided society.

I also think you're wrong about the finances too. Immigrants tend to be young, and pay far more in taxes than they use in services. They are actually subsidising the NHS rather than exploiting it. Many studies ([like this](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1113/051113-migration-report)) have consistently shown this.

please twist my words more.

Hard working people and poor working conditions are not the same thing and coming to that conclusion is just fucking stupid and down right ignorant, dont twist my words just because you disagree with me.

The point im trying to make is that when someone like Nigel Farage insinuates that immigrants often contribute little or nothing to our society when they enter it and are just generally lazy/bleed the system; is wrong and has continuously been proven as such by studies and statistics.

Also, the main source of immigration is from the EU, which all citizens of the EU are entitled to do under the free movement of labour legislation. So the only thing that this country can do to ""curb immigration"" is to make it even MORE difficult for immigrants from thirdworld/developing countries which is pretty low anyway.

As well as this the UK makes quite a lot of money from foreign students coming to the UK to study, and the pressure that Nigel Farage is putting on the government is actually damaging the economy because of his fundamentally flawed concept of how this country and the rest of the world works.

And I do blame Amazon. In fact, since 2013 it is illegal in this country to create artificial business structures whose sole purpose is to contravene the intent of tax laws. Aggressive tax avoidance is not only unacceptable, but illegal.

Here's what the govt say is the [purpose of the new General Anti-Abuse Regulation] (http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/avoidance/gaar-part-abc.pdf) (GAAR):

&gt; The GAAR Study Group Report was based on the premise that the levying of tax is the principal mechanism by which the state pays for the services and facilities that it provides for its citizens, and that all taxpayers should pay their fair contribution. This same premise underlies the GAAR. **It therefore rejects the approach taken by the Courts in a number of old cases to the effect that taxpayers are free to use their ingenuity to reduce their tax bills by any lawful means**, however contrived those means might be and however far the tax consequences might diverge from the real economic position.

Unfortunately, by the time it was brought in it had been weakened considerably by industry lobbyists (and politicians caved in because they know which side their bread is buttered - see Point 1, above).

We need to campaign to get the GAAR strengthened, and to force companies like amazon to be more transparent in their accounting, so we can see what kind of dodges they are up to. ",1,1405336478,null,0,false,0,ciwyd22,t3_2anhkh,t1_ciwyd22,t1_ciwy8v8,null,1434706764,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Veridas,eng-kent,The nutter round the corner.,"&gt;There's no such thing as an ordinary person. Is a doctor ordinary? a head teacher? What you mean is pay them less than their worth because you don't like politicians. A regional manager for a retail business earns around £60-70,000, but you think someone who manages an actual region of a country isn't worth that? 

Average, then. The ONS recently stated that the average wage is about £26,500 in April 2012. We're dealing with people who already make three times that. If you kept MPs wages in line with that ratio and they complained about it then they're probably not there for the good of the country and no amount of money will change it.

&gt; What you mean is pay them less than their worth because you don't like politicians

What I mean is pay them in a manner that keeps them connected to **average** people financially, because those are the people they are being elected to lead. You wouldn't ask a lawyer to organise an invasion, you wouldn't ask an Army Colonel to sort out a legal dispute. Leaders can only lead effectively if they understand the needs and wants of those they lead. I do not believe our current leaders have that.

Oh, and to say I dislike politicians is a little biased. I like some politicians, I do not like politicians that fuck about with public services like they're toys, keep open various tax loopholes for their buddies, lie to our faces about the need for otherwise needless laws and generally spend a majority of their time in power wanking off with the Union Fucking Jack.

So in short. I do not like the politicians we have. I'm not sure how that negates my point, though.

&gt;The average wage is meaningless, there are millions of people earning minimum wage in this country. No-one wants an MP who earns minimum wage. 

Strawman. If we're going to discuss MP's pay then it might be a good idea to look at...you know...MP's pay. Answer the point or concede it but don't try any fucking salsa sidestep bullshit.

&gt;Again, how much does a CEO of a major corporation earn? A lot more than £100,000.

Corporations have a lot less power, social responsibility and mandate than politicians. Additionally, Corporations can be run into the ground and nobody bats a fucking eyelid. So Corporations can pay their bosses whatever exuberant amounts those bosses demand because they're private entities the existence of which does not impact on politics or the lives of a majority of or-sorry *average* people on a day to day basis. I repeat my earlier point that giving a lawyer a rifle would be a bad idea and giving a Major your power of attorney would be equally bad. Corporations by definition are constructs of limited expertise. Government by definition cannot be.

&gt;Again, how much does a CEO of a major corporation earn? A lot more than £100,000.

Answered this just now. Skipping.

&gt;One of the problems with your argument is that you think MPs have an easy job, and that once they become an MP they are part of the establishment, so anything goes, make them work 22 hours a day for minimum wage then fire them if they complain. Anyone can stand as an MP, anyone can start a political party, and it's important that the job be able to sustain a family, and attract the best kind of talent.

Funnily enough I don't believe any of that. I believe that MPs have a challenging job, yes. I believe that they work decent hours and should be paid a decent wage. The problem here is that you need me to believe that because you know full fucking well that you cannot otherwise justify nearly doubling the wages of a person without any increased bang for your buck UNLESS you emphasise just how hard they work.

Answer me this at least, and try not to sidestep. Would increasing an MP's wage to a hundred grand a year improve the quality of MP that we receive?

&gt;Can you tell me a single time in history when the majority of people have been happy with their government? 

Certainltly. It could be argued that at any time when a sitting administration was re-elected in a fair and democratic election that the majority of people were happy with the Government. Which means most European countres, England included, the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and a few other Asian nations have all had people at varying points in modern history alone that have been happy with their Government.

&gt;People complain about the bad but ignore the good. People will never be happy with their government, but that doesn't always mean they are always doing a bad job.

This might be a compelling point if it wasn't for the fact that the entire idea that we look at the bad is arguably why we get MPs of any quality at all. Compare to the US where Senators are given almost hero worship. Now compare the kind of assholes that apply to be Senators to the people you see trying to become MPs.

Rick Perry would get dismembered in the fucking street.

&gt;It is a good time if we want to reform the system. Pay MPs £100,000 per year, but tighten up the expenses system and we will save money, and MPs overall will be getting less. 

Oh it really really isn't. 

Give every fired nurse, trooper, cop, fireman and civil servant their job back and increase investment in our health service, construction of housing, reform the police service to re-introduce policing by consent and actually punish the occasional fucks that ruin it for everyone else rather than just give them a slap on the wrist when people in their custody end up dead. Close the tax loopholes, start actually engaging with Europe rather than acting like a spoilt child, communicate with people, earn back their trust, THEN we can start discussing pay.

&gt;Nobody, anywhere has ever said that MPs are suffering. The system of deciding how to pay MPs is broken as i mentioned above, and if we want to reform it we need to accept that MPs have been underpaid and using expenses to top up their income. 

Let me ask you this.

If you upped the pay to a hundred grand tomorrow but kept the expenses system, do you still think we'd see MPs abusing the fuck out of it?

If the answer is yes then clearly raising their pay is a non-issue because the money they earn is superseded by the money they can take for whatever non-reason they can dream up in whatever spare time they have.

If the answer is no then the wage itself is equally meaningless and ought to be removed in favour of a more global expenses system.

&gt;I agree. The reason these problems exist in the first place is that we do not pay our MPs fairly. 

There's no such thing as ""fair"" as what's fair and unfair is perspective or opinion, not subjective fact. Advantages or disadvantages in any situation cannot accomodate for the simple human quality of skill or lack thereof, and to claim that anything is fair or unfair is at an best lazy argument made for the sake of sounding like you want the right thing rather than actually trying to make it happen.

&gt;There are thousands of advisers and members of staff in government that do just that. But the MP is the democratically elected representative who makes decisions based on that advice.

true,votadini_,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt;Many thanks for your email regarding the government's emergency legislation on communication data.  This is an incredibly complicated and difficult subject.  I do agree with what you say in your email that we need to look at this issue on a long term basis with proper debate but let me explain my reasons for this being necessary in this limited instance.  You also ask me to represent my constituents.  I will do this on Tuesday but I have had emails from constituents who are urging me to support this.

&gt;It is worth looking at why this is happening next week.  As a result of a recent judgement by the European Court of Justice, the police and intelligence agencies are in danger of losing vital information which is used in 95% of serious and organised crime investigations as well as counter terror investigations and online child abuse.

&gt;In order to prevent this, UK legislation needs to change to be made compliant with EU law following the ECJ judgement. If these changes are not made, the police are likely to suddenly lose vital evidence this summer.   The Government has come forward with emergency legislation and in considering the Government's proposals, I believe it is essential to maintain the security of  citizens and also ensure people's privacy is protected.

&gt;Serious criminal investigations and counter terrorism intelligence operations must not be jeopardised. That is why I support this emergency legislation which I accept is designed solely to protect existing capabilities.

&gt;To emphasise, this legislation will only enable agencies to maintain existing capabilities. It will respond to the ECJ judgement on data retention and bring clarity to existing law in response to CSP's requests.  It is not about allowing the recording of all phone calls, texts and internet browsing history.  The ECJ judgement struck down a much wider EU Directive that the UK must now comply with.

&gt;Also, some companies are calling for a clearer legal framework to underpin their cooperation with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept what terrorists and serious criminals are saying to each other. This is the ability to access content WITH A WARRANT.

&gt;This is not a re-run of the previous ""snoopers charter"".  It was Labour that stopped the previous attempts by Government to introduce this new law as it was too widely drawn and replaced the responsibility of the law courts to Ministers.  This does not have any relation to that at all.  This is merely to keep the current regulations in place until new legislation can be brought forward.

&gt;However, given the limited Parliamentary time to discuss emergency legislation Labour has ensured that the Government's legislation is temporary and it will expire in 2016. This will require the Government and Parliament to properly consult on and consider longer term proposals next year.   It is vitally important that this happens as we have 1980s legislation in a 21st century world of technology and I think that is why we have a patchwork of legislation that doesn't work for Government or, indeed, the public who want security and privacy.

&gt;Labour has also now secured agreement to our proposal for a major independent review of the legal framework governing data access and interception (the RIPA review we called for earlier this year) in the light of the huge changes in technology. As I have previously argued, in the wake of the Snowdon leaks and the concerns raised about whether the legal framework has failed to keep up with new technology, there is a clear need for wider public debate about the right balance between security and privacy online, a review of powers and stronger oversight.  The public must be involved in this process to find the appropriate balance.

&gt;This review will enable longer term questions and concerns to be properly dealt with and debated in time for new legislation. Changes will then follow. Labour has also called for and secured further safeguards to restrict the ways in which communications data and intercept can be used to prevent misuse.

&gt;I do share your concerns about rushed nature of these proposals being presented to Parliament, and I am pleased that we have been able to secure safeguards within the limited timetable. I support the temporary legislation and I can assure you that I will scrutinise the detail of the proposals when this is debated in Parliament next week. It would be far too damaging to the fight against serious crime, online child abuse and counter terrorist intelligence to suddenly lose these capabilities now, and these safeguards have secured a better process for longer term reform to make sure we have the right capabilities and the right safeguards in place.

&gt;Thank you again for your letter on this very important issue and I will continue to carefully consider the points you raise when this is debated in Parliament next week.  If the legislation goes beyond this I will not support it.  It will require intensive scrutiny to ensure it is appropriate and sensible.

And as other have pointed out, the majority of most work forces are replaceable, so that work will go to those who will work for the least amount of money. 

Plus, it's always easier to get more money when you already have money. Those at the bottom of the debt pyramid have to sell almost all of their labour just to service debts (whether overtly or covertly). 

So those at the bottom are in many ways stuck there - it's difficult to make any progress financially. Once you're above a certain point though, it gets easier, and easier, and easier ... Money makes money. And once you have money and power you can easily get more of it, in the ways I've just described.

The global economy built on interest / debt money quite literally has this kind of escalating inequality built into it's very fabric. As long as money defies the law of decay (actually, money does the opposite, it GROWS with interest over time), this problem will repeat itself over and over.

People don't really consider this - but the ""money"" we use today isn't a set in stone - if we all agreed to give our money different properties (like making sure it obeys universal laws) things could be very different. 

People take money's ""interest"" to be a given, like the law of gravity. But it's not, it's just a crazy property the owners and creators of money have invented to ensure everyone is always in debt and fighting over never-enough money. Why? Because in doing so they remain powerful, and also rich.

Here's some of the awesome stuff they've done over the years:

* When some scammer used my card details to book a flight, they returned the money the same day I reported it, even before I'd made a police report. 
* Immediately after this, they sent out a replacement card which was stolen from my shared post box and someone took it on a spending spree around town. I was really afraid to call them because it must have sounded so suspicious - they were incredible, giving me the money back immediately. They launched a short investigation but it never felt like I was under undue suspicion.
* In a very sad and lonely period of my life, I once had a nervous breakdown. During this period I maxed out some credit cards, and then didn't open any letters for over a year. It was a good two years before I contacted them. I opened a letter one day that said 'Please Call - We can Help' - and they really fucking did help. It wasn't just financial advice, they were genuinely supportive and friendly, extending my overdraft to get me out of a bind, and they never sent the debt to a collection agency, or even threatened to. They did try to get me into a loan but that's just banks for you. Now I've paid everything back and doing well financially, they've earned a lifelong, grateful customer.

I can understand why Fry wants to stick up for his mate, but the fact that such accusations hurt careers of celebrities or entertainers more than the average member of the public shouldn’t really factor into things. The respect the public has for popular entertainers is part of the reason men like Savil and Harris got away for things so long; having legal consequences for people trying to report they were sexually assaulted is only going to bury the real cases more deeply.

Because how can someone ever prove they were sexually assaulted 30-odd years ago? There is often little more to go on than witness testimony, and even in recent cases its rarely enough to convict someone.

&gt;Olafur Mar Sigurdsson, brother of Gylfi Sigurdsson says there is no truth to the news from that an eight million pound bid by Crystal Palace has been accepted. The player is happy at Tottenham and a lot needs to happen for him to leave the club.

&gt;Five Year Plan, the Crystal Palace fan site, announced today that Tottenham had accepted a bid from Crystal Palace for Gylfi. The Iceland international would be a record signing for Crystal Palace.

&gt;News agency spoke to Gylfi's brother, Olaf Sigurdsson. He says there is no truth to these rumors - no offer has been accepted and the player is happy at Tottenham. A lot would need to change for him to leave the team.

&gt;Gylfi has recently been linked to both Crystal Palace and Swansea. Olaf Mar reiterates that the player is happy in London.

&gt;Icelandic players have indeed not had particularly good experience with Tony Pulis, manager Crystal Palace. Eidur Gudjohnsen was time playing in Stoke when Pulis was manager. Gudjohnsen didn't play many games and Pulis explained that this was because he wasn't in good enough shape physically, he then left the team.

&gt;Furthermore Pulis' treatment Bjarni Gudjonsson and Tryggvi Gudmundsson during his time at Stoke when neither received virtually any game time when they were purchased for Stoke at the time when the team was owned by Icelanders. The same was true of Thord Guðjónssyni. ""What struck me most was how badly he spoke of Icelanders. In the media he [was efficient to shoot them in the flooded?] and so it was striking how Pulis spoke about the owners in front of the players, ""said Thord to the DV at the time.",0,1405339157,null,0,false,0,ciwyx3v,t3_2and5i,t1_ciwyx3v,t3_2and5i,null,1434707026,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

No, her country does not require 40% taxes on middle class salaries to fund a state healthcare system.

true,redstarduggan,,Belfast,"&gt; Because it's a celebration of a event 300 years years ago that's been 
&gt; coopted variously by religious extremists, politcal extremists and 
&gt; gangsters.

Is the problem that it was an event 300 years ago or that it has been coopted?

Of all the social and political problems we have I don't think the 12th itself is one of them. Issues in Ardoyne aside, which aren't really specifically because it is the 12th, then you can see it's a day which is universally popular amongst the unionist community and not 'full' of hate and bigotry.

&gt; I'm neither religious nor a British Nationalist, so I all I see is pointless &gt; flag waving.

Everyone has their opinion on the matter of flags.I see flags as important symbols of nationhood and community. I hate to see them misused but have no problem with them being displayed and flown. Some of the most impressive and awe-inspiring sights I've been fortunate to witness have involved flags (million people on the mall in london, landsdowne road for the 1999 european cup final). Again, because something is misused by a minority it doesn't stop being legitimate.

&gt; More generally nationalism annoys me. Seeing people descend into 
&gt; idiotic tribalism because of something as arbitrary as where they 
&gt; happened to be born is a frustrating experience.

Birthplace is not arbitrary at all. It's a factor of the location of your parents, ie home. There's nothing wrong with nationalism, it can be very healthy. It can act as a binding agent for a community which otherwise may have little in common.

You're entitled to your opinion, but I think because you don't feel part of it, which is understandable/fine, you don't see the positives. This year's celebrations were reasonably quiet as far as trouble goes. We need to work on it and continue to weed out the troublesome elements.

Worst case scenario is your company is planning to fire you because you cannot do your job, but you can pre-empt this with a 'settlement agreement'. That is where you agree to go quietly, in exchange for a negotiated reference on your C.V. and possibly some money. Even if your company had grounds to fire you off the bat, given the option they will still probably want to go with a settlement agreement (as long as your demands are reasonable). Going to an employment tribunal costs time and money, even if they win.

That is all worst case scenario stuff, of course. You might enquire about being retrained to do your job - you wouldn't be the first person to do so. 

Anyway, get advice. Do it now.

true,cathartis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"The problem to me is that the entire philosophical basis of the way our society rewards people is deeply suspect. Many people in this thread are basing their arguments on assumptions that simply don't make any sense when closely scrutinised.

Lets look at a few of what, in my opinion, are fallacies:

**Fallacy 1: Workers are paid according to their productivity. If they become more productive, they are paid more.**

Why it is wrong: Producitivity in western countries has increased considerably over the last 20 years, and yet wages have grown much more slowly, and in some cases have declined in real terms.

**Fallacy 2: People are worth what they can earn in competitive marketplace**

Why it is wrong: If in the future, robots are invented that can outcompete humans in every job, to the extent that no humans are employed, then this leads to the conclusion that humanity has no value. Since very few people believe that, we have a reductio ad adsurbum.

**Fallacy 3: People in top jobs are the best possible people to do those jobs.**

Why it is wrong: I'm not aware of any studies showing that CEOs are better at running companies than other intelligent individuals would be. There are, however, studies showing that there are a disproportionate number of executives with Psychopathic tendencies, indicating that in at least some cases these individuals are there because they are more ruthless and better at climbing corporate hierarchies.

**Fallacy 4: It is important to encourage good performance in CEOs**

Why it is wrong: Why do you think only CEOs respond to pay differentials in performance, and not the people below them? Beyond a certain pay level, more money makes very little difference to rich people - all their basic needs are already fulfilled, and it's simply a way of keeping score. A 10% pay rise means far, far more to an ordinary worker than a CEO.

**Fallacy 5: The problem is that ordinary workers are being paid too little**

Why it is wrong: Our planet's environment is already screwed. Making ordinary people richer, so they buy more crap to throw away, will make it even worse for our children. The problem instead is that the high wages enjoyed by CEOs allows them to exert disproportionate political power, which exasperates many of the other problems we face (including environmental ones).

**Fallacy 6: There is nothing wrong with very high inequlity (or very high CEO wages)**

Why it is wrong: There's a whole wealth of evidence that countries with a very high level of inequality experience worse outcomes in areas such as health, education and social stability. This is all summarised in the book ""The Spirit Level"". If inequality grows too high, then society breaks down, and everyone loses, including the CEOs.

**Fallacy 7: Stronger unions will solve this**

Why it is wrong: The real cause of declining wages is that our current economic system pits our workers in competition with those from developing countries. So if unions demand higher pay, they simply make their companies less competitive, and jobs are lost. One could argue that this competition from developing countries is a good thing - there is no a-priori reason why westerners should continue to occupy the privileged position they have enjoyed for the last couple of centuries.

However the tricky bit here, would be that normally, ""self-employed hairdressers"" aren't actually self employed (you don't get to pick I'm afraid). Check out http://www.hji.co.uk/article/2012/05/legal-advice-for-self-employed/ If it goes to court and she is found to be an employee, not self employed this can end up expensive all round as the revenue will get involved (never a fun outcome). The contract would then have transferred from the old employer to the new employer under TUPE regulations. 

If she is truly self employed, then things could end up complicated (read expensive if it goes to court). Her contract may have changed hands from a sole trader to the new owners business, and would be enforceable, or she may be seen to be a self-employed subcontractor and would only be liable to works days already agreed. 

Usually, the best advice I can give in these situations is to leave on amicable terms and don't get the courts involved where possible. If that means working her notice, then it's normally easier to just work the notice period, but if she want's to break the contract I would recommend getting an employment solicitor to look over the whole thing.

That argument can be made about UK citizens too. The point is if you're **normally residing** in the UK, then you should be allowed the same level of access as everyone else. And even government data has shown that the vast majority of EU migrants are not costing the country more than they are putting back in from their taxes.

The issue here is your assumption that all EU citizens, unless they are dual UK citizens, will only be here for a short time and end up being a net drain. Which is bollocks. Especially when you consider the cost of the average EU migrant, who tends to be at least moderately health in their early 20's or 30's, their cost to the NHS is going to be minimal. These are not 60+ year olds with osteoporosis that need hip and knee replacements, long term therapy, etc.

The average cost of insurance in the US is $328 for those that don't qualify for subsidies:

http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/25/us-usa-healthcare-exchanges-idUSBRE98O03P20130925

That's about £2300 a year. She pays £7000 in income tax, £4000 in National Insurance, and I'd conservatively estimate about £4000 in VAT. 18% of that tax goes on the NHS, meaning she pays about £2700 to the NHS. So she's paying more, and then has to pay 150% of the cost for treatment again? We'd clearly save money on healthcare in the US.

I've got one which gives me between 1-2% return on all purchases.

I'm in a much better position for online shopping than a debit card if anything goes wrong because of the consumer credit act.

It lets me keep my emergency money in less liquid assets (i.e. ones with a higher rate of return) because if I need to buy something in an emergency, it goes on the credit card, and then I can liquidate those assets over the next month or so, or for smaller matters, pay for it out of my next pay cheque and accept I'm going to have a lean month.

Sure of course Scotland becoming Independent will have those stated affect on England, Wales, Northern Ireland. The affects for the whole UK, including Scotland ""prompt dread"" for anyone who doesn't like change.

BUT........

People in Scotland and England are far more concerned about this than the people in Northern Ireland are, even ""loyalists"". That much is pretty obvious. ""Loyalists"" in N.I have solidarity with the unionists in Scotland but if Scotland leaves the U.K..... N.I unionists will still be unionists.


The Dread belongs to the UK government. All those Oil fields lost and the embarrassment of appearing to be weak.

If loyalists were so full of ""dread"".....don't you think we would have had at least one obviously related protest here?

Because of factors outside of religion.  Because Muslims are humans capable of independent rational and moral thought. Because they can think for themselves.

Similarly, many Christians accept evolution, but that doesn't mean that the Bible teaches evolution!  It's because religious people are able to get knowledge from sources outside of their religious texts.

But one of the biggest problems with religion is that it impedes this knowledge acquisition.  It claims to be the final truth and shuts down questioning.  People abdicate thinking for themselves and instead allow religious leaders or religious texts to decide their position on issues, which can sometimes lead to disastrous consequences.

Well if its a choice between two good policies/one bad one or no good policies, which does he go for? Politics is about trades and favours, just like many areas of life. I don't think you are being realistic.

&gt; I don't see any reason why any one person should be able to donate more than a fairly small amount to a politician - say £1000/year.

I don't believe in permissive law; rather I think things should only be prohibited for good reason, thus putting the onus on you. The trouble is that bribery is available by means other than donations, such as hospitality or promises of future favours. I'm not sure a nominal limit would do as much good as you think it would.

A corollary of your point of view is that constituents should be limited in the amount of face time they have with an MP, or the amount of letters they can write to them.

Ireland did indeed support the right of Jews to a homeland but viewed the subsequent partition and creation of a **Jewish Only State** as the worst possible solution. This article is polarised and incapable of making an accurate assessment of [Irish thought](http://www.theirishstory.com/2013/01/23/a-long-and-oddly-intertwined-history-irish-nationalism-and-zionism/) of the time
 
&gt;  Judah Leb Magnes, head of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a leading figure in bi-nationalism, a utopian strand of Zionism that sought to create a harmonious Jewish-Arab state, went so far as to seek out Eamon de Valera’s thoughts on partition.  Magnes’ original letter does not appear to have survived (it is not included either in de Valera’s papers in UCD nor in Magnes’ papers in the Central Archive for the History of the Jewish People at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem), but de Valera’s extant reply gives an intimate précis of his views on partition, draws an overt comparison between Ireland and Palestine and suggests that Magnes saw things similarly:
&gt; 
&gt; *I do not know the Palestine problem as you know it, but from a knowledge of what partition means in Ireland now, and what I am convinced it will mean in the future, I have reached the same conclusion as you have, namely: only by negotiation and free agreement between Jew and Arab… can there be a satisfactory solution.* **I regard partition as perhaps the worst of the many solutions that have been proposed.**

On several occasions they've not allowed me to make purchases for purely random reasons.

Only later I saw the missed calls and it's impossible to get them to remake/resend the call.

I tried contacting their customer support to authorise the transaction but they asked me impossible-to-answer ""security"" questions and then refused to speak to me. Do you know what your last Tesco/Sainsbury/Waitrose purchase was to the exact penny?

This has happened to me on several occasions. Now I don't bother calling Lloyds, 
instead I use PayPal, Amazon payments, or I phone the company and tell them my credit card details instead. Never had a problem doing it that way. 

Their online banking security is stupid and painful. i.e. ""what is the 3rd 6th and 7th letters of your second password"". Yet, I am able to withdraw my maximum daily limit from an ATM with my 4 digit PIN. Go figure.

The other day I set up a standing order and a once-off payment for something. I had to do the usual phone-back with the authorisation code. I had to do it twice, for the same company, for both the standing order and the one-off payment.  They use different payee details for each type of payment. 

Last week, I ordered some of their £5 printed statements which I need for a visa application. One week later I'm still waiting to receive them. They must have hand written them and posted via 4th Class mail.

true,tnjhawks,null,null,"The issue with Liverpool's defense last year wasn't it's defensive players.  It was our defensive tactics.  As we saw with Skrtel in Brendan's first year, it's mentally tough on a defender to play our style of football. It takes time to learn and adapt. Defense is also a position that involves way more teamwork and communication than other positions.  Gerrard can always see Sturridge making a run into the box and float a pass in but our defenders have to trust that everyone else is keeping a high line or marking the man they need to. Bringing in new starters won't really help with that. 

Brendan needs to fix his tactics.  We had a habit of scoring 2 really quickly then just absorbing pressure throughout the game and hoping to counter attack.  Of course goals are going to start coming in when we do that.  We also play an ""attack, attack, attack"" style where we don't let up (as opposed to holding possession).  This leaves our full backs way out of position. Players like Can will help with this - who can hang out between the CBs and stop counter-attacks in the build up.  Stevie is great but he is so attack minded that he can forget to hang back and cover.  If Rogers fixes these things we'll be set. 

We have great defenders, they just need time to work with each other. Bringing in some defensive cover would be good but I think we have a very good back line so far.

You could always email congregations (congregations@kent.ac.uk, http://www.kent.ac.uk/congregations/) and also beg for a ticket.  Even better, visit them in person at the Rutherford annexe and ask.  Worth a try.

Failing that, everybody is allowed in the Cathedral grounds so your grannies and SO would be able to see you in your gown, take pictures etc. just not go in to the Cathedral for the ceremony itself.  Take it from me however, the ceremony is boring.   You have your LITERAL 15 seconds of fame as you shake the VC's hand and walk down the aisle... back to your seat.  They say the names of EVERYONE and it takes a while.  They do record the entire thing, and it is available for free to watch on the Kent Uni website soon after the ceremony.  You can also purchase the DVD.  

The actual ceremony tends to last ~1h30 so in that time your grannies and SO could take a river tour as mentioned below.  If they like relaxing I recommend the tour by Westgate, and do the mid-length one in to the countryside (50min).

Liverpool's opening six matches of the 2014-15 Barclays Premier League season, and a total of 10 before December, have today been rescheduled for television coverage.

The Reds will now officially kick off their campaign on Sunday August 17, when Southampton visit Anfield for a 1.30pm BST fixture that will be broadcast by Sky Sports.

Subsequent journeys to Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur will be shown on the same channel, on Monday August 25 at 8pm and Sunday August 31 at 1.30pm respectively.

The home clash with Aston Villa remains on Saturday September 13, though kick-off is now 5.30pm on Sky Sports, who will then televise the trip to West Ham United at 5.30pm on Saturday September 20.

Liverpool debut on BT Sport in the first Merseyside derby of the season; Brendan Rodgers' side host Everton on Saturday September 27, with kick-off scheduled for 12.45pm.

Sky Sports will screen the Reds' away fixture at Queens Park Rangers, which has been moved to a 1.30pm start on Sunday October 19.

On Saturday November 1, BT Sport broadcast the clash with Newcastle United at St James' Park. Kick-off has been rearranged for 12.45pm. A week later, Saturday November 8, the same channel will show Liverpool at home to Chelsea with the same kick-off time.

Finally, Rodgers' charges will feature on Sky Sports when they meet Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. That match now begins at 1.30pm on Sunday November 23.

**Please note that the fixtures against Queens Park Rangers and Crystal Palace are subject to change depending on Champions League commitments.**

&gt; You seem to be confusing desirability with reality. Politics is by its very nature about resolving interests that conflict to different degrees


Any political favours should be granted to voters not to the people who donate the most. Consider how pensioners get a very good deal (triple-locked pension increases while the rest of the population is undergoing benefit cuts etc) in large part because the elderly are somewhat sympathetic and they turn out to elections. This is not corrupt. On the other hand owners of healthcare companies donating to politicians involved in radical reform and privatisation of the NHS (c.f. Circle Healthcare) reeks. There is an absolute difference between rewarding voters and rewarding donors: the former is unsatisfactory while the latter is fundamentally corrupt.

As to your suggestion that I'm a naive idealist, there's no reason to accept corruption and there's no reason to think we have to tolerate it: the rule of law is fundamental to liberty, a free society and free markets.",0,1405348578,null,0,false,0,cix225s,t3_2anbsl,t1_cix225s,t1_cix1cci,null,1434708595,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

As /u/TheHoneyThief put it:

&gt; Firstly, imagine every time within a day that football is mentioned by someone else. Secondly, replace it with something that you don't want to hear about every day. Say... Archaeology. Then, think about how an average day would pan out.

&gt; So, you awaken to the clock radio. It's 7AM. Just as you awaken, it's time for the news and archaeology already. Not news and other historical investigations, like library restorations or museum openings (unless there's another event happening), but just the news and archaelogy. Malaysian plane is still missing. Pistorius is still on trial. New dig announced in Giza. Ancient Mayan temple discovered. Exciting stuff.

&gt; Time for a bite to eat over the morning TV. More news. More archaeology. Yes, you are aware of what is up with the missing plane. Fine. Now the archaeology in video format. Video of people dusting off some skulls and bits of pottery. All well and good, but archaeology isn't your thing. It would be nice to hear about something else. Even when it isn't archaeology season, the media follow noted archaeologists. They drive fast cars, have sex with beautiful women, advertise fragrances, and sometimes they go to nightclubs and act in the worst possible way. Scandals erupt as the tabloids follow these new celebrities when they're not searching the past for answers. It is entirely possible you can recite the names of certain researchers, even if you don't pay attention to archaeology. You don't know what transfer season is, but you know that someone was transferred to a dig in Peru for a sum of money that could fund the London Underground for two whole days.

&gt; Out of the car at 8:55 and into work. What are the colleagues talking about, I wonder? Oh, Jones dropped a 3,890 year old pot and smashed it? What a useless wanker! Someone should do something unpleasant to him. And don't even ask about the unfortunate incident in Athens two years ago - you'll be there all day! Breaking a pillar like that! We don't talk about that here, mate. What? You don't want to discuss the finer points of the prevalence of phallic imagery in Pompeii? Is there something wrong with you?

&gt; The drive home from work. Every thirty minutes, no matter the station, someone mentions the archaeology. Best sit in silence. Drive past a huge billboard with a black and white picture of a rakishly handsome archaeologist draped over an impossibly beautiful woman. He's winking at you. Trowel in his left hand, supermodel in the right. Jurassic, by Calvin Klein.

&gt; And now the pub. A nice pub with a beer garden. Posters in the windows. LIVE EXCAVATION AT THE VALLEY OF THE KINGS! All of it on a huge TV with the volume up too loud. Drunken people yelling at the screen. ""SEND IT FOR CARBON DATING, YOU USELESS CUNT!"" ""WHAT ARE YOU ON, MATE? DUST THE ANCIENT MEDALLION GENTLY! SMELTING METHODS OF THE TIME PRODUCED VERY SOFT AND IMPURE METALS EASILY PRONE TO DISFIGURATION!"" All this from two men out of a crowd of twenty. One lousy drunken idiot and his chum ruin the image of other archaeology fans. Carbon dating report from the lab updates on TV, read by a man employed because they've been following the beautiful science since they were a boy. The drunk chimes in again. ""WHAT PHARAOH'S REIGN DID YOU SAY? DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS SAYS ABOUT THE UNDERPINNINGS OF OUR THEORY OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF 4TH BC EGYPT? GET IN, MATE!"" A cheer cascades through the building and you can only wonder why.

&gt; Best go home and avoid anyone who might be drinking and singing. You once met a disagreeable chap who threatened to beat you up because you didn't watch the archaeology. ""Not a late paleolithic era supporter are you? Think you're better than me? I'll fucking have you, you scrawny cunt!""

&gt; To bed. To repeat the cycle tomorrow. The inescapable, inevitability that wherever you go, someone, somewhere, is just dying to talk to you about the archaeology.

---------------Guzan-----------------

-------Okore Vlaar Senderos--------

Bacuna Westwood Delph Richardson

Bench: Given Lowton Clark Gardner N'Zogbia Weimann Kozak.


With Weimann starting in place of Benteke, Robinson on the bench in place of Kozak until they return from injury. Still think we need a centre mid, winger and possibly a striker to be confident of staying up.

Our voting system, first past the post, makes it very difficult for any new parties to gain traction so 'the establishment' is virtually untouchable. They have got away with the expenses scandal, with hardly a blip on their comfy horizons. They constantly treat us with contempt by abusing their privileges and trying to justify their actions, then treat us as if we are stupid because we don't seem to understand why it should to be one rule for them but another for us.

Lots of people in the public eye, usually the field of entertainment, have been arrested on sex charges. Some have been found guilty but lots of others haven't. All have been publicly named and careers have been destroyed. We were told they had to pursue the claims at all cost.

What happened when similiar accusations where made about 'the establishment'? Surprise, surprise the file was 'lost'

Now that the details of the 'loss' are getting out we are having a public investigation. But there is no long grass they can kick this one into so what do they do? They create some by insisting that not only do they get investigated, but every other possible organisation is included, you know, just for clarity.

Yeah Frenchification was a big deal back then, a lot of people, men and women alike, were getting worked up that men were becoming foppish and effeminate, in contrast to the manly men from the golden age of Elizabeth I, when things like chivalry and honour were apparently a bigger deal. 

It was a common concern in court especially as Charles I's wife was French. You had a lot of continental influences with regards to stuff like dress, fashion and entertainment, and there was a bit of a reaction to it with a some people looking back to the grand old days of the Tudors with rose tinted glasses, when the men were men and the Spanish were scared. That's evident even in this petition, for instance: ""There was a glorious Dispensation ('twas surely in the 
Golden Age) when Lusty Ladds of seven or eight hundred

&gt; Any political favours should be granted to voters not to the people who donate the most. Consider how pensioners get a very good deal (triple-locked pension increases while the rest of the population is undergoing benefit cuts etc) in large part because the elderly are somewhat sympathetic and they turn out to elections. This is not corrupt. On the other hand owners of healthcare companies donating to politicians involved in radical reform and privatisation of the NHS (c.f. Circle Healthcare) reeks. There is an absolute difference between rewarding voters and rewarding donors: the former is unsatisfactory while the latter is fundamentally corrupt.

The ballot box does endow a politician with legitimacy in terms of exercising public will that donations cannot convey, but that does not mean he should be deaf to the contributions of corporations, any more than they should be deaf to trade unions. Ultimately corporations are a necessary part of society, and they deserve to have some say in how the country functions.

&gt; As to your suggestion that I'm a naive idealist, there's no reason to accept corruption and there's no reason to think we have to tolerate it: the rule of law is fundamental to liberty, a free society and free markets.

One has to accept corruption for the same reason one has to accept crime: there are costs in fighting it and at some point those costs outweigh the benefits that could be gained. I'm not suggesting we should let all corruption slide, but I reject the notion it all can be eliminated. At any rate the corruption indexes I have seen indicate the UK does quite well on that front.

First, the European Court of Justice has struck down regulations enabling internet providers to retain communications data for law enforcement purposes for up to 12 months.  This legislation will enable agencies to maintain existing capabilities.  It will respond to the ECJ judgement on data retention and bring clarity to existing law in response to CSP’s requests.
 
The Labour opposition have secured agreement from the government that this emergency legislation will be temporary - it will expire in 2016.   We have also secured agreement to a major independent review of the legal framework governing surveillance (as we called for four months ago) so that there can be a proper public and Parliamentary debate over what the longer term legislation and arrangements should be.  The Government has also agreed to a new Privacy and Civil Liberties Board, something for which I have argued for years.
 
The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens. The Labour opposition, and I agree, believe that data and intelligence is needed - especially for tackling serious crime, online crime and preventing terrorism.  Last year the Child Exploitation and Online Protection agency received 18,887 reports of child abuse – an increase of 14% on the year.  Without this sort of information these abusers would be impossible to find and stop.
 
However, we also believe more safeguards and stronger oversight are needed, as well as reforms because the legislation is out of date given new technology.  I will support my labour colleagues to scrutinise the detail of the Government's proposals, but we will support the temporary legislation as it would be far too damaging to the fight against serious crime, online child abuse and counter terrorist intelligence to suddenly lose these capabilities now.
 
Bluntly, all investigations into online child sex abuse and major investigations into terrorism and organised crime, including preventing young people from travelling to Syria, would fall entirely or be in severe jeopardy.  Without it:

•the police efforts to catch paedophiles sharing child abuse images through online networks would be hampered.

•The mobile phone records that helped police find out about the attempted terrorist attack at Glasgow airport in 2007 would no longer be available.

•And the security services wouldn’t have been able to check who the Woolwich attackers had contacted to make sure there were no further attacks planned.
 
Some people have argued that this is being rushed.  However, I believe it to be a necessary timetable, indeed it should have been tabled earlier. There will have to a longer term re-think when the Privacy and Civil Liberties Board has been created and as the contentious part of the legislation has a “sunset clause” (it ceases to have effect after a fixed period), this consideration has been met.

true,cathartis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; Except that many productivity gains have been due to investment in capital. Why should the increasing productivity accrue to the worker?

Why should it accrue to the CEO or the shareholder? What I'm saying at this point in my post is that whilst the assumption of ""if people want more they should work harder"" may be correct on an individual basis, in the context of a wider society, it's very dodgy, since employers use mechanisms such as the threat of unemployment and foreign competition to keep wages low regardless of how much is being produced.

&gt; There is a difference between human value and labour market productivity. 

That's exactly my point. The ""Protestant work ethic"", with it's inherent assumption that a person's worth correlates with their employment, is fundamentally wrong. Yet so many people in our society use it as a basis for their reasoning

&gt; Define what you mean by 'value?' 

No, I'm not going to define the value of a human being. If I started doing that we could get into endless philosophical debates. Can we just agree that it's non-zero?

&gt; Why should the fact that they are psychopathic preclude them from being very good at being a CEO? This seems to be a normative judgement not an economic one. 

Depends what you mean by a ""good CEO"". I certainly wouldn't want to work for someone who was a psychopath. However even if we accept that some psychopaths are good CEOs, this still doesn't explain why we find a disproportionate number of psychopaths in executive positions.

&gt; The fact that there is a decline in marginal utility to pay rises does not imply that a pay rise will have no effect on high earners. 

Straw man. I never said it would have no effect. I said it would have less effect.

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"&gt; Anyway, the main thing I would like to ask is how has this revelation really been received in the UK?

Generally quite a mixed bunch. 

Up until 2003, many tabloids (which make up the majority of newspaper sales in the UK) would do countdowns for attractive children, counting down until their 16th birthday, when they could be legally featured naked in the public newspapers. That was 11 years ago, because it wasn't until 2003 that we made it illegal for 16 - 18 year old kids to star in pornographic stuff.

I think people like to feel outraged at this stuff, and I'm not sure if they intentionally or accidentally forget the difference 30 - 40 years makes to a culture. I'm not saying that all these paedophiles are right, but people express such disgust ""how could this have happened?"" I'm only in my 20s, but my understanding is that in the 60 - 80's, this kind of thing was generally just ignored. That doesn't make it right, but by the same token, it explains why nothing was done until now - because until now, people didn't care that much about that sort of behaviour.

I think there's a lot of anger towards certain cases though, particularly Jimmy Saville. I think with Jimmy Saville, some of the outrage isn't at the idea he groomed childeren, but more at the idea he mislead everyone. I think the same goes for Rolf Harris as well, peoples upset and anger isn't so much that he hurt children, but that he duped everyone into thinking he wouldn't ever do such a thing. People feel personally lied to.

&gt; Then how dangerous do you think all this can be? For democracy?

I don't think it'll be any more dangerous than any of the other monthly scandals our politicians give us. I definitely understand what you're referring to with discontent towards politicians, but I think with all the scandal on entertainers being paedophiles, it's almost normalised the idea of famous or powerful people exploiting young people. I think there's a lot to be said about whether these people would have engaged in such horrible behaviour if they didn't have the same positions of power. 

Personally, I've lost track of all the people accused. When I see a headline ""&lt;insert famous name here&gt; accused of &lt;insert indecent sexual behaviour here&gt;"" it kind of just washes over me now, my thoughts are ""ooh, another day, another famous paedophile allegation"". I think the general public are starting to become bored or desensitized to sexual deviancy by those in power which is quite sad and bad. My concern is that someone like Rolf who provided a lot of good to the world, took the worst of the flack, whilst now some of the politicians who have been nothing but a leech to society will go unnoticed because it's become such a common thing in our media.

The same can be said about politics in general. Sure, the paedophile files conveniently disappeared. I don't think anyone thinks that happened by accident. But it's just another one of those things - we'll role our collective eyes, grumble over our cereal about politicians shafting us, and then carry on about our daily lives because of the perception that there's nothing we can do about it. It's sad how accustomed we've become to ""1 rule for them and a different rule for everyone else.""

If executives don't make sustainable decisions that created a strong company then the shareholders won't benefit and it will just be an example of why not seeking shareholder value is a bad thing. I'm sure Enron's shareholders were very pleased when they lost all their money. If they had really been concerned with shareholder value they wouldn't have caused the company to collapse. After all what is a company - it's a legal entity that is created when a group of people get together because they think they can make more money when they are incorporated than unincorporated. Shareholders created the company because it's a tool they want to use to do business through. To tell the people that created and own a company to make money that they are the least important aspect of the companies aims is not exactly fair and defeats the purpose of a company which, of course, any of us could created and own. 

Having said that there's no harm in requiring executives to take into account other factors than shareholder value. Luckily that is the system we have in England and Wales called 'Enhanced Shareholder Value'. Executives are legally bound to act in a way to ensure the company will succeed. Their primary concern must be shareholder value but they must also take into account employees, business relationships, the environment etc. Ignoring these too often will allow shareholders or more likely a liquidator looking for cash to sue the directors. When a company is going bankrupt and will probably go into liquidation directors are legally bound to think of creditors nor shareholders who immediately become the least important. Again they can be sued if they try and take care of the shareholders in this situation.

My diss was more about ideas of masculinity in 17th century England, focussing on a Civil War general as a kinda case study. It didn't really cover the sex habits and concerns of Elizabethan and Stuart people. I think I missed a trick there though, this is far more amusing. 

Hopefully not all Stuart guys were shit in bed though; I mean Samuel Pepys always had multiple mistresses on the go, so he must have been doing something right. Maybe he just avoided coffeehouses.

LB: pretty obvious, only got Enrique and he's been out near all last season. Moreno signing should cover this. 


CB: Speculation over Aggers future and we could do with someone a little more comfortable on the ball than Skrtel who's nice and vocal. 


RB: A case of quantity not quality currently, Johnson is Johnson and we don't really have a stand out player. Flann plays his heart out but he'll likely never reach the potential quality we need there. Can see us leaving this for next summer unless someone great pops up for sale cheapish. 


CM/DM: we've got some very energetic players for the central pairing but could possibly do with a real solid defensive minded player especially if Lucas is to leave. Again the same as RB, can see this waiting till next summer unless someone quality is available. 


Wingers/IF: Sterling, Ibe, Markovic, all three are young and full of potential. If we're going to go big with a signing it'll be for someone out wide. Lallana and coutinho can both fit out there but they're much more likely to be central. 


ST: Sturridge has a huge season ahead of him with no Suarez to take all the media focus. Lambert gives us a very nice option from the bench to switch up styles but could do with another signing. Someone experience but willing to be rotated and not be the main forward option. This could tie in with the wide player we need if we're able to get someone who's comfortable in both positions and is a threat.

&gt;Why should it accrue to the CEO or the shareholder? 

Because their investment provided the means to increase productivity (arguably). If increasing productivity from the worker were due to their own investment or ability (higher education or training for instance), then quite rightly it should accrue to them. 

&gt;&gt; Define what you mean by 'value?'
&gt; No, I'm not going to define the value of a human being. If I started doing that we could get into endless philosophical debates. Can we just agree that it's non-zero?

Could you clarify whether you mean labour market value or value as a person then? Because unless you define your terms you will create ambiguous arguments

&gt;&gt; Why should the fact that they are psychopathic preclude them from being very good at being a CEO? This seems to be a normative judgement not an economic one.

&gt; Depends what you mean by a ""good CEO"".

One who is able to manage the company effectively. No more, no less. Why does being a psychopath preclude this?

&gt; &gt; The fact that there is a decline in marginal utility to pay rises does not imply that a pay rise will have no effect on high earners.

&gt; Straw man. I never said it would have no effect. I said it would have less effect.

Which does not imply that it is not worth doing. Particularly since a CEO's decisions will have wider ranging implications than an entry level worker.

&gt; Your link does nothing to demonstrate that. Of course right wingers attack a publication that undermines their arguments. However the book is much better grounded in research than the post you link to.

Those are my criticisms having read the book, and working in social science. Try to address the specifics of what I said, rather than creating ad homonia from thin air (you have no idea of what my politics are!) to assure yourself that the Spirit Level is useful.

Thank you for contacting me about the emergency Data Retention and  
Investigatory Powers Bill.

I appreciate your concerns on this issue. No-one introduces fast-track  
legislation lightly, but the consequences of not acting are grave.  
Communications data and interception helps keep people safe from  
terrorists and other serious, dangerous criminals. Communications data  
is used in 95 per cent of all serious and organised crime  
prosecutions, and every major counter-terrorism investigation over the  
last decade.

If we do not act, we face losing these powers that are used to counter  
the threats we face from terrorists and organised criminals. The  
European Court of Justice has struck down regulations that let  
internet and phone companies retain communications data for law  
enforcement purposes for up to 12 months. As well as this, some  
companies are calling for a clearer legal framework to underpin their  
cooperation with law enforcement and intelligence agencies to  
intercept what terrorists and serious criminals are saying to each  
other. This is the ability to access content with a warrant signed by  
a Secretary of State.

The emergency Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Bill will enable  
agencies to maintain existing capabilities. It will respond to the ECJ  
judgment on data retention and bring clarity to existing law in  
response to the concerns of some companies. It is a narrow and limited  
response to the set of specific challenges we face. It solves the  
immediate problems at hand. Importantly, the Bill includes a  
termination clause so it will fall at the end of 2016 – forcing the  
Government to look again at these powers.

You may also be interested to know that the Government has introduced  
a number of measures as part of the Bill which will strengthen the  
oversight of intelligence powers. Between now and 2016, the Government  
will review the Regulation of Investigatory Power Act to make  
recommendations to reform and update it. The Government is also  
establishing a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to ensure  
civil liberties are properly considered when the Government sets  
counter-terrorism policy.

The Government is also restricting the number of public bodies that  
can ask for communications data and publishing annual transparency  
reports. This will make more information publicly available than ever  
before.
I believe that the action this Government is taking will ensure we  
maintain powers to help keep us safe from those who would harm UK  
citizens.

Thank you again for taking the time to contact me.

Oh well, they have a lot of fans of various levels of knowledge, like most big clubs. But on reddit, they seem to attract a lot of the new, less-educated fans. For a new fan, perhaps it's easier to identify with the sorrow of another ""rival"" club rather than understand and enjoy a victory for your club?

I've got 5 uncles and 4 aunts, all with partners and kids of their own, there's no way that there's NOT going to be drama (and in some cases, vigilantism).

You should probably read the articles you linked too.

From the Guardian article:

&gt; **Lose** to Liverpool and players would be sold, merciless cutbacks implemented across the board and ambitions radically downsized.

From the Independent article:

&gt; However, as is so often the case, the truth is a little less romantic than the myth. Chelsea only needed to avoid defeat against Liverpool to guarantee Champions League football, so in fact it was Marcel Desailly's header to equalise Sami Hyypia's opener rather than Gronkjaer's winner which should really be feted as the key moment.

&gt;**Do I have to worry about existing EU standards of consumer, environment or health protection?**

&gt;No. We will not negotiate existing levels of protection for the sake of an agreement.  Our high level of protection here in Europe is non-negotiable.  But let us not forget that the US also takes protection of its citizens very seriously.  Both the EU and the US are committed to high levels of protection for our citizens, but we go about it in different ways.  The EU sometimes relies more on regulations, the US more on litigation.  Both approaches can be effective, but neither is perfect.  There is room to learn from each other. 

&gt;This is not a race to the bottom.  Making our regulations more compatible does not mean going for the lowest common denominator, but rather seeing where we diverge unnecessarily.  There will be no compromise whatsoever on safety, consumer protection or the environment.  But there will be a willingness to look pragmatically on whether we can do things better and in a more coordinated fashion.  Obviously, each side will keep the right to regulate environmental, safety and health issues at the level each side considers appropriate. 

and

&gt;**What will happen to agriculture?**

&gt;The negotiations for the TTIP will include agriculture. Opening up agriculture markets will be a two-way street with benefits for both the EU and the US.

&gt;The US is interested in selling more of its agricultural commodities, such as wheat and soy. EU exports to the US are mostly higher value food products like spirits, wine, beer, and processed food (such as cheeses, ham and chocolate). Europe has a clear interest in being able to sell more of the top quality foods it produces to the US. At the moment, some European food products, such as apples and various cheeses, are banned from the US market; others are subject to high US tariffs – meat 30%, drinks 22-23%, and dairy products up to 139%. Removing these and other barriers will help boost EU exports to the US.

and

&gt;**Will the EU be forced to change its laws on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs)?**

&gt;No, it will not. Basic laws, like those relating to GMOs or which are there to protect human life and health, animal health and welfare, or environment and consumer interests will not be part of the negotiations.

&gt;Under EU rules, GMOs that have been approved for use as food, for animal feed or for sowing as crops can already be sold in the EU.  Applications for approval are assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and then sent to EU Member States for their opinion.  So far, 52 GMOs have been authorised.  The safety assessment which EFSA carries out before any GMO is placed on the market and the risk management procedure will not be affected by the negotiations.

&gt;The EU and US already exchange information on policy, regulations and technical issues concerning GMOs.  Cooperation of this sort helps minimise the effect on trade of our respective systems for approving GMOs.  We see the TTIP as an opportunity to support this cooperation.

and

&gt;**Will European supermarkets be filled with meat from American animals fed with hormones?**

&gt;No, they will not. The negotiations will not be about compromising the health of our consumers for commercial gain. Tough EU laws, like those relating to hormones, or those which are there to protect human life and health, animal health and welfare, or environment and consumer interests will not be part of the negotiations.

The police can only stop and search you on the reasonable suspicion that you are carrying drugs, weapons, or tools for burglary (under PACE), involved with terrorism, and a few other things (poaching, stolen goods, crossbow parts if you are under 17... ).

If they ask you questions, I suggest asking ""am I obliged to answer that?"" or saying ""no comment"", unless you feel like helping them. Remember that anything you say can and WILL be used against you, which is why ""no comment"" answers are so important. 

If they do ask to search you, ask for their names, badge numbers, force info and under what section of what law they are searching you. If they refuse to answer, then you should be wary of them, and considering calling a solicitor, and making this known to the officers.

If you want to walk away, ask them if you are being detained, and if they say no, or refuse to answer, you can walk away.

I strongly recommend recording interactions with the police, as it has been shown to reduce violent incidents and improve police compliance with the law.

2. Wide Forward: The hope is a player like Reus, right?

3. Striker: I'm not sure if a ""striker"" in the traditional sense of the word is a position that we're going to fill. I think we're more than happy with Sturridge and Lambert and we're going to count on guys like Sterling, Markovic(maybe), Lallana, Coutinho, Henderson to step and provide more goals as well.

Cut off time depends on what time your shift started. The cut off time in my area is between 1430 &amp; 1455, depending on the day. Some of the rounds don't cut off until gone 1630.

 If we feel that we will be going over our time and cutting off we tell the manager who arranges to have another postie do it. But the majority of postmen will work over their time because we can claim it back on overtime or time owed. 

There could be a number of reasons you haven't received post. The most likely being that you didn't have any. And the least likely being that there was no postie available or the workers refused to work due to union recommendation or working conditions.

true,cathartis,eng-hampshire,Hampshire,"&gt; Because their investment provided the means to increase productivity (arguably).

Investment comes from shareholders, not out of a CEOs wages. So that would be an argument for increasing dividends, not CEO wages. You also do very little to demonstrate that recent gains in productivity in any way correlated with shareholder savvy, nor that today's shareholders are any wiser than those of previous decades.

I'd suggest to you that two of the biggest factors affecting recent productivity gains are the higher education level of workers compared to their parents, and the increasing use of IT in the workplace over the last few decades. Neither of which require any special genius on the part of investors.

I guess my point is that our society automatically awards productivity gains to CEOs and shareholders. Their true origins don't actually matter, and doesn't affect the way the money flows in the slightest.

&gt; Could you clarify whether you mean labour market value or value as a person then? Because unless you define your terms you will create ambiguous arguments

That's my entire point - labour market value is different from value as a person. If you accept that much, then we are in agreement.

&gt; Which does not imply that it is not worth doing. Particularly since a CEO's decisions will have wider ranging implications than an entry level worker.

Of course it is good to have the best CEO. However I'd counter that it's extremely hard to judge ""best"" at that sort of level given how much deception, blaming, and taking credit for others achievements goes on. There is no effective way to compare CEOs, and the metrics many institutions use (short term share price changes) are very poor, and encourage destructive behaviour from CEOs.

I'd also suggest that paying a CEO too much will actively cause them to make worse decisions. It encourages them to act as egotistical alpha-males, and to believe in their own infallibility. So they then act over-aggressively and engage in the sort of international take-over sprees that ruined many of Britain's largest banks in the financial collapse, which exposed many incredibly well paid executives as having made objectively terrible decisions.

&gt; Those are my criticisms having read the book, and working in social science. Try to address the specifics of what I said

If I tried to do that in detail, I'd imagine we'd go way off-topic. However  if you work in social science then you are aware that controlled experiments are, in many cases, impossible. So the things you criticize, such as basing results on correlation, are the best that social science has to offer. The book doesn't offer certainty, but it makes some pretty persuasive arguments.",0,1405356579,null,0,1405357148,0,cix62er,t3_2anbsl,t1_cix62er,t1_cix4sdv,null,1434710464,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Rainen,null,null,"Honestly, this year should be about consolidation in the top 4 and simply performing well on all fronts, managing player rotation well, and gaining experience. Hear me out:

Our team is young - and we're picking up young potential superstars. Markovic, Sterling, Can, Coutinho, Suso, Sturridge, Henderson, Allen, Moreno (if we get him), Origi, Ilori (possibly) are all 24 or younger, and all have unique traits that provide different options for BR.

Lambert, Gerrard, Skrtel, Johnson, Agger are all 29+ and have limited tenures remaining. Gerrard is a special case, but look for BR to strengthen his back line in the 2nd half of the transfer window, predominantly with younger players of great potential who will learn from the outgoing veterans.

With a few more key signings, BR will have potential world beaters at almost every position, with people like Joe Allen in his prime as a change of pace. Lallana, with his gobs of experience, will be the old head in a couple of years as these players start to really hit their prime, and BR is planning on his leadership as he develops these players.

BR is planning for a sustained run at premier league success, not necessarily a title tilt this year, all built with budding superstars entering their prime. He well knows that Barca, Real and whomever can come and pay stupid release clauses for world class players (Suarez), but that they can be world class for us before that happens, if we can keep them into their late twenties or so. Those release clauses will enable us to buy more young superstars at more reasonable prices, providing the next wave of quality, and the more we do this, the more of a destination we will become to young superstars, creating very happy marriages. 

It's a long term approach by BR and FSG.

Just my 2c, but that's how I see things based on our transfer activity.

This year:

Champion's league: Advance from Group Stages

EPL: Maintain top 4 with other competition commitments

FA: Make a run this year, unless we're deep in the Champion's league or in a title tilt

&gt; What are the best areas to live? I'd love somewhere with great shopping, beaches and not overly expensive. Is that an oxymoron...?

Seaside towns are highly geared towards tourism, so you won't get loads of shops or malls there usually. Having said that, you can quite easily get to the seaside from anywhere in the UK (you're never more than ~70 miles away from the sea) - it's probably better for you to live in the city and go to the beach when you feel like it (especially as the weather is normally not nice enough to go to the beach).

&gt; What is the shopping like there?

Major cities (like Newcastle) will have big shopping areas in the city centre, and usually have malls on the outskirts - both of which will have the usual major chains etc., with the city centre often having other things like seasonal markets (unsure in Newcastle), independent shops, bars, pubs and clubs etc.

&gt; What areas should I avoid?

Instead I found something that I consider to be pretty well written and makes some damn fine points.

The SWP is a rotten corpse that really should be wound up. I dont think any sane left winger could draw a different conclusion. It is the very image of the shrill harpy left wing that complements the shrill harpy right wing, existing largely to be contrary and closing ranks to defend the indefensible, like that article headline and the rape fiasco a year or so ago.  (As an aside, the whole Trotskyist thing is a bit crap. Trots do little more than shove a SWP paper into your hand, rave like an evangelical preacher at you and then leave you alone. Hardly the best introduction to finding out about socialism.)

I guess the best bit of this article is the point Jones raises about background baiting. He makes a damn fine point about the shrill parts of the right wing being all too eager to point the finger at people who have left wing views but are firmly part of the establishment in terms of massive salary (Crow/Laurie Penny) or sending their kids to private school (labour cabinet); but are suspiciously quiet when such things suit their own ends.

Its like a robber being quiet until a copper is accused of theft, at which point the robber speaks up against the copper - massive hypocrisy, but couched in such a way as to make the victim of abuse the *only* guilty party.

Look at what Moffat's doing with Capaldi right now! Look at the marketing for that! No ""trust me, I'm the Doctor"", no funny lines... Capaldi was cast because he was right for the show the production team wanted to make and it also proves that Smith was cast for the exact same reason and not to appeal to some demographic.

Of course it is the drivers responsibility to be insured, but most of these lads will be getting minimum wage and wearing out their car, they're not going to pay an extra £1,000 a year on their insurance policy to add business use for delivering pizza. 

Maybe they should quit and get a job at Domino's who do insure their drivers, but I'm told they pay pretty crap fuel allowance, have to buy and wear uniform, and are held to performance targets.

Short for 'New ISA', this is the replacement. It's a single fund that you can hold whatever proportion you want in terms of how much cash and/or stock. All the restrictions are hone. 

Why should you get a NISA?

- No tax on interest earned on any cash holdings

- No capital gains tax on appreciation of stocks up to the value of 11,200 gain per year.

- No tax on dividends for stocks held in the NISA, except for when you're in the 'higher' or 'extra' rate tax bands.

- No tax whatsoever on the coupons earned from any bonds you may hold in the NISA

- You have a 15k allowance to max out this financial year. 

- You can max out another 15k next year, for a total of 30k, and so on. Or to whatever amount the treasury sets at the time. The real balance of your NISA will of course be higher due to returns (if you made any). 

In regards to your questions, I recommend doing the bouncer job maybe 1 weekend night a week, not 2. It'll get you where you want to be faster. I live in London so salaries are higher, but living costs where you live in Aberdeen are lower so I am assuming your salary is good for your area.

Waiting to try and get tickets for big games can have you waiting years, but if you're loaded get it through hospitality or thomas cook!

May I add that to ensure my chance to get to a CL game I will just go all out with my wages and buy the hospitality ticket, Not taking the risk just for the normal member sale. **THESE WILL BE EXTREMELY HIGH DEMAND**

Traore is currently at Monaco and is a massive man (6'8"", 2.03m), but at times looks like a baby giraffe learning how to walk.

Essentially we have two strikers with large shortcomings, and a decent shot at getting another on loan, who also has huge shortcomings. It will be our weakest position this season if we aren't able to upgrade.

(the usual IANAL etc. I may be mistaken - and someone should feel free to correct me if I am.

I believe you are confusing the latest ""Sexual offences act 2003"" and exploitation of minors as being the same date. There have been laws in the UK around exploitation of girls under 16 since ""Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885"". This act was only one to strengthen laws around explotation of women and children. So I have no doubt there are preceding laws or at least social stigmas.

&gt; but my understanding is that in the 60 - 80's, this kind of thing was generally just ignored. That doesn't make it right, but by the same token, it explains why nothing was done until now - because until now, people didn't care that much about that sort of behaviour.

I've had the conversation with lots of people now. I think they've all agreed that it was socially stigmatised and illegal for such things to be happening in the 60s.

I don't think the issue was ignored by the general public, as much as the general public did not get to find things out. Communication as it is nowadays is an incredibly new thing.

It would be fair to say that  myself and Ms. Lackpot would give slightly differing accounts of the experience, since I was considerably less bothered than she was, but that's hardly surprising.

The level of clinical care wasn't found especially wanting; but the personal care was. We were left for long periods without attention or pain management, despite requests and assurances, to the point that I eventually had to approach a group of nurses and say ""I need attention now, you've kept on making promises and failed to keep them, this isn't good enough, you have to act now"". Luckily I was calm and polite and they realised the game was up and we soon got some attention.

Even so, it was a long and arduous labour and although the quiet and long hours with the midwife in the small hours in the delivery suite were quite satisfactory, there were complications which resulted in a DS full of medicos bustling with activity, a failed venteuse attempt, episiotomy, forceps delivery, and following stitch up. It was scary, undignified, impersonal, and at times uncaring. I suppose one or two of those might be forgivable; the whole shooting match was not.

Our daughter was born with a head roughly the shape of a banana shallot, but it had returned to more or less normal after about three hours. The malleability of the neo-natal human skull is shockingly wonderful ... as was evinced by that incorrigible perv /u/PeterSutcliffe who found that self-same head so attractive in another thread a few weeks ago &amp;#3232;_&amp;#3232;

As a non-EU migrant to the UK who works and pays NI and income tax like everyone else, does that mean I'll be charged? The article seems to say both yes and no in two different places. Because if the answer is 'yes', then they can get fucked. I pay my NI contributions like everyone else.

It seems to be suggesting both that 

a) Nothing will change in who is able to access the NHS for free. Only people who would be charged anyway (which would basically only be visitors to the UK who happen to require non-emergency treatment for an existing condition) will be charged 150% of regular costs; 

&gt; The UK seeks to reclaim 100% of the cost of treating EU and non-EU nationals where charges are applicable. 

&gt; Non-UK citizens who are lawfully entitled to reside in the UK and usually live in the country will be entitled to free NHS care as they are now. 

**AND**

b) Everyone who's not a permanent resident will be charged.

&gt; From next year, trusts will be able to charge 150% of the normal cost of treatment for non-EU patients who are ""non-permanent residents"" in the UK.

&gt; But temporary migrants from outside Europe who are in the UK for longer than six months, either to work or study, will have to pay a new surcharge when they submit an application for leave to enter or remain in the UK.

Those can't both be true at the same time, so which is it? I suspect a BBC journalist not familiar with immigration law who is misusing terms like 'resident' without knowing what they actually legally mean.

Very happy that I finally got off my arse and applied for EU citizenship through ancestry so I don't have to deal with being non-EU any more. But the idea that non-EU migrants who work full-time and pay NI should have to pay an additional levy to secure entry clearance isn't fair. 'This is about fairness to the British taxpayer'? Fuck you and your fairness. Those taxpayers are all British **residents**, not British citizens. Me and the other hundreds of thousands of non-EU migrants making NI contributions are somehow unworthy of receiving what we've paid for seeks of pretty populist vendettas against an increasingly marginalised group.

Can's passing ability and tackling, as well as speed and ball control are impressive. Markovic dribbling is fantastic, and he makes very good runs. I think they both will thrive.

As I said I considered the Tories ""morally dubious"", that doesn't mean that I thought they were all child-molesters, its more that it doesn't surprise me.

The only realistic outcome there would be nobody daring to come forward for fear that they might lose the case and be open to charges of false accusation, which *nobody* wants.

On the other hand, sexual assault (and molestation in particular) is unusual in that anybody can be accused and, even if exonerated, have their lives thoroughly ruined by people who maintain that 'there's not smoke without fire' or similar.

The best way through I can think of would be to make it illegal for the media to report the names of people accused of crimes before a conviction has been handed out. To my mind, this should go for everything. It doesn't necessarily mean a media blackout, but instead of 'Lord Fotherington-Smythewick has been accused of molestation' it would have to be 'a senior peer has been accused of molestation'.",0,1405365462,null,0,false,0,cixawkh,t3_2anf0l,t1_cixawkh,t1_ciwxz7b,null,1434712813,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,Mynameisaw,yorkshire,West Yorkshire,"&gt;Wage is dictated by those who are in control. Over time, slowly but surely, they decide they are entitled to an ever larger slice of the pie.

This is far too short sighted.

I've yet to be in a company where the CEO decides how much they're paid. In most cases it's decided by committees or shareholder voting.

CEOs and executives see bigger pay rises because of demand. 

With the recession the bottom line saw a complete lack of demand - for every worker demanding a pay rise there were 3 unemployed ready to replace them.

Executive positions didn't see this effect so pay rises had to be substantial to stop people leaving for other companies.

This applies post and pre recession as well; it's very easy to replace a labourer or an Administrator so there's no sense of need to give them a decent pay rise - but there is a sense of need to pay executives well.

&gt;And as other have pointed out, the majority of most work forces are replaceable, so that work will go to those who will work for the least amount of money. 

This in a nutshell.

Savings can be made by hard balling your bottom line, the higher up you go the less likely this is to work.

How The UK Government ‘Secretly’ Influenced Its Citizens’ Behaviours

Can governments influence the decisions and actions of their citizens without the public’s conscious knowledge? Since 2010, the U.K. government has had a taskforce, nicknamed the “Nudge Unit”, which utilises behavioural economics to come up with policies that can ""encourage and enable people to make better choices for themselves.""

25% is where basically everyone gets involved. Rates are lower, mortgage is smaller and more profit can be made.

However, the vast majority of lenders want owner occupiers (whether with a mortgage or mortgage-free) to get BTL mortgages because of the concern a FTB will just live in the BTL themselves - a backdoor resi mortgage - avoiding the tougher criteria a residential mortgage has.

Without having any mortgage ever and wanting your first BTL before your first residential, I can think of 3 lenders (Natwest being the only big name) who would consider it.

Also, theoretically, as I would be significantly overpaying each month, what length mortgage should I go for? Obviously a longer one has lower required payments but I would likely be paying back anywhere up to £750 a month rather than the £3xx figure the payment required?

""Beaches"" stands out as an unusual requirement.  With our climate, even in towns with nice beaches there is not really a beach lifestyle.  Vast majority of the year you're not likely to go in the sea unless you're a committed surfer or similar, with a wetsuit.  If that's your thing then Cornwall.  But Cornwall is remote and rural, not a stronghold of global-city-grade shopping, nor is there a surplus of jobs there tbh, yet costs are driven high by holidaymakers and second home owners.  So it wouldn't seem to fit.

Whereas our bigger cities like London, Manchester and Liverpool will offer you plentiful shopping and possibilities for jobs in media/sports, but you'll not have a beach.  And possibly not cheap either.

Basically I think your requirements / expectations might need fine tuning....

Dear [my real name],

Thank you for writing to me regarding the Government’s emergency legislation on communication data and interception.

As a result of a recent judgement by the European Court of Justice, the police and intelligence agencies are in danger of losing vital information which is used in 95% of serious and organised crime investigations as well as counter terror investigations and online child abuse.

In order to prevent this, UK legislation needs to change to be compliant with EU law. If these changes are not made, the police are likely to suddenly lose vital evidence this summer. 

I share your concerns about the rushed nature of these proposals, but as a former criminal barrister I know how crippling the loss of this evidence would be in prosecuting dangerous or violent offenders. 

Given the limited Parliamentary time available to discuss the emergency legislation Labour has ensured that the Government’s legislation is temporary and that it will expire in 2016. This will require the Government and Parliament to properly consult on and consider longer term proposals next year. 

I think it is important to remember that this is not the Snooper’s Charter that the Government previously tried to push through Parliament and which I opposed.  No extension of powers will be introduced in this temporary legislation.  This legislation is designed solely to protect existing capabilities in compliance with the European Court of Justice’s ruling and in fact Labour has now been able to secure safeguards that have not previously existed. 

We have also now secured agreement to our proposal for a major independent review of the legal framework governing data access and interception (the RIPA review we called for earlier this year) in light of the huge changes in technology.  In the wake of the Snowdon leaks and the concerns raised about whether the legal framework has failed to keep up with new technology, there is a clear need for wider public debate about the right balance between security and privacy online, a review of powers and stronger oversight.

I think it is important that legislation is subject to full parliamentary debate and scrutiny and I am very disappointed that the Government has waited until the last possible moment to introduce these temporary measures.  However, I will support these proposals as I believe it would be far too damaging in the fight against serious crime and terrorism if the police and intelligence services were to suddenly lose existing capabilities. 

I will be sure to keep your comments and concerns in mind when I scrutinise the details of the Government’s plans in Parliament next week.

Thanks again for your e-mail.  I really appreciate the time you have taken to share your views on this important issue.

Yours sincerely,

Andy Slaughter

The only additional shoulder checks/lifesavers would be before changing your position on the road. I think the order is: shoulder check/lifesaver - indicate - lifesaver then change position in one smooth move.

Basically dude, just look before you act and make sure that 'look' is obvious. I remember during mine I would just do a shoulder check every now and again even if I was staying on a straight line (obviously not every 10 metres, but you get the idea), besides helping you by knowing what's around you it also shows the instructor you are alert to your surroundings and an attentive rider.

Immigration is a deal where there are benefits for both parties.

1. On the website it says you have to activate it, but you can just do that at the station you depart from when you are about to travel. After that then yes it will just be like a normal ticket.

2. I assume so but there is no mention on that website of the guest pass? Also, are you eligible for a railcard ( railcard.co.uk )? That gives you a bigger discount than the guest pass - 1/3.

3. If you are planning to travel off peak, then £129 seems very expensive indeed. From a quick Google I believe it's just talking about overnight journeys - if you are travelling overnight, and leave after 7pm, and don't change trains until after 4 am, you only use 1 day of your ticket (the day you arrive).

This is the attitude held by every member of the anglican clergy I know personally. This is of course only anecdotal, but it's misleading to think of the *entire church* as being against ""being in the 21st century"". It is notable that it was chiefly the house of laity (congregants as opposed to ordained ministers) who were against reform - the overwhelming majority of the episcopate supported the move and have done for some time. 

""The Church"" *is* trying to lead its members into the 21st Century. But part of the point of the Church of England is that it is a melting pot of many different theological and social viewpoints, and therefore debates around this kind of issue will inevitably arise as those who wish to take the bible more literally come into conflict with academically-trained theologians. But in my opinion it's a good thing to have that all happening within one broad religious organisation than lots of little groups fighting each other.

It's difficult to work it out without knowing the length of term (and even then still fiddly due to repayment mortgage) but if your interest rate was 4% for the entire term (assuming 10 years). And your mortgage was £100,000, you'd pay back £121,494. On 20 years: £145,435. Figuring out the monthly ratio of interest:capital is difficult because the interest recalculates daily.

You've misunderstood the monthly payment vs the rental stress test. Assuming a 4% interest rate, on £70,000 interest only, you'd pay 1/12 of 4% per month. £2800 over the year, £233.33 per month. If that was repayment, on 20 years it would be £424 per month.

The lender doesn't care about that cost, they will use rental stress tests. With Natwest, they would want to know if the rent can cover 5.25% of £70,000 (£3675 a year), so per month: £306. Times monthly by 125%. Rent needs to be £382.81 per month. You're not paying £382 a month, but your rent needs to be at least this per month for Natwest to lend 70k.

&gt;Where did I say any family doesn't deserve justice? Seriously, explain where you pulled that from.  Even if MI5 can out and admitted to killing Neave, you would still blame in on the republicans.

You'd rather raise arguments without foundation, based on the person you argue with and not the logic of the point. Clear enough.

&gt;My post history includes a massive range of topics on tons of different subs. 

Oh get you lol. What a great point. Of course your opinion matters more, why do I doubt it!

&gt;Yours consists of about 99% posts to /r/northernireland and 99% of those are supporting loyalism or attacking republicanisn/ Catholicism / Irish culture. 

*ats oor kulcha!*

Amirite?

&gt;You just hover around here all day waiting for an opportunity to throw in your next jibe. People downvote you because you post hardline loyalists comments where they are completely unrelated. 

The voice of the all knowing, speaking for one and all yet again. You even know how people browse reddit? And unrelated comments? 

Arrogant joke!

I was at the Olympic Park for one of the days of the Paralympics... it was the day that Richard Whitehead raced... but that's not my stand-out memory.

No, it was of one of the other races.  Truth be told, I can't recall the race distance, I can't recall the specific competitor, but it was one of the longer track races - longer than 800m, might have been the 1,500m.

Right from the start there was one competitor... he was obviously slower, obviously never going to be competing for a medal, but that didn't matter to him.  He was there not to win, but to simply compete, to run his own race, to prove he could do it.

By the end of the first lap, he was maybe a third of the way around the track.  He was lapped, not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times.  The other runners had finished, but he was still moving, plodding around at his speed.

The spectators suddenly realised that, even though the race was over, the 1-2-3 had been decided, *he* was still running.  And the crowd *really* got behind him.  As he passed each section of crowd, we were up on our feet, shouting, cheering, encouraging him to keep going.  His finishing time was irrelevant, except to maybe himself.  He wanted to finish.  We wanted him to finish.  We *urged* him to keep going.  And he did.  And he finished, in last place, but a Paralympian nonetheless.

And *that* is my best remembered moment of the 2012 London Games.

You can't get the bonus £100 from upgrading your account. It only works on a switching basis.

With regards to the monthly £5; it's easy enough to upgrade, just go into the branch and talk to somebody. You can do it online sometimes but it tends to bounce you if you haven't had £750 per month for the past X months (I seem to remember it being 6) whereas there's more leniency in the branch, as you might imagine.

If you don't pay in the £750 one month, you simply don't get the fiver. If you consistently don't pay in that £750 then the account eventually just gets downgraded back to the standard account. No other changes, just the lack of the £5 opportunity. If you go back to paying it, you can upgrade again. There are no fiscal punishments or anything of that nature.

It's worth bearing in mind though if you put £750+ in and immediately move it out, you don't get the bonus. For example, I have my own Reward Account and a joint one with the missus. When I get paid, around £1000 goes into my account. However, around £700 then leaves the following day, to be transferred to the joint account where all the bills come out of (joined by her half of the bills on her payday), and we only receive the £5 bonus in the joint account. However the accounts were never downgraded.

This also leads to your third question: Essentially yes you can just transfer the money into this reward account and receive the money. If you get paid into the normal Halifax Current though and it's upgraded, the bank account no.

I was moving out at the start of summer but 2 of the other people were staying there the next year and one of their friends was taking my room. The landlord was aware and it was clear that I was leaving, sometime in July iirc. The landlord eventually comes and does an inspection a few months later and at some point the bed in my room had been damaged. She decided to keep my deposit and not even tell me, when I chase it and she tells me that she was keeping the deposit I was livid. The girls in the flat were obviously telling her I did it and the landlady believed them. Worse still she was claiming that the nasty old single cheap pine bed frame was costing £800 to fix, realistically it was a 50 quid frame.

I took her to small claims, it turns out they hold the hearing near the defendant, which was in herts (I'm in devon) plus a recent bereavement meant attending wasn't an option - everything I had needed to say I had already said in written correspondence so I declined to attend. They took no account at all of everything I had put in writing and found in the landlords favour.

I was way too trusting (young and naive!) so something like this happening didn't even occur to me. It was a really unpleasant experience, so do what you can to avoid it happening to you.

IANAL, but definitely document everything in excruciating detail. If you're the sole occupant, id be inclined to write to the landlord saying you'll be surrendering your keys on a certain date and if they refuse to inspect in your presence you won't be liable for any damages found.

While diesel theft is an issue for many sites which store their own fuel I doubt there's mass theft such as this going on anywhere.

&gt;The __United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD)__ ([Thai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_language): แนวร่วมประชาธิปไตยต่อต้านเผด็จการแห่งชาติ; นปช., alternatively translated as __National Democratic Alliance against Dictatorship__), whose supporters are commonly called __Red Shirts__, is a political pressure group opposed to the [People's Alliance for Democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Alliance_for_Democracy) (PAD), the 2006 Thai military coup, and supporters of the coup. Notable UDD leaders include [Jatuporn Prompan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jatuporn_Prompan), [Nattawut Saikua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nattawut_Saikua), [Veera Musikapong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veera_Musikapong), Charan Ditthapichai and [Weng Tojirakarn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weng_Tojirakarn). The UDD allies itself with the [Pheu Thai Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheu_Thai_Party), which is currently in office in a [coalition government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_thailand). Before the July 2011 national elections, the UDD claimed that [Abhisit Vejjajiva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhisit_Vejjajiva)'s government took power illegitimately, backed by the Thai Army and the judiciary. Therefore, the UDD called for the [Thai Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Thailand) to be dissolved so that a general re-election could be held. UDD accuses the country's extra-democratic elite – the military, judiciary, certain members of the [Privy Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privy_Council_of_Thailand), and other unelected officials – of undermining democracy by interfering in politics.  The UDD is composed of mostly rural masses from Northeast ([Isan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isan)) and North Thailand, of urban lower classes from [Bangkok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok) and of some intellectuals. Although the movement seems to receive support from former Prime Minister in exile [Thaksin Shinawatra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaksin_Shinawatra), not all UDD members support the deposed Prime Minister.

The one where Liverpool tell Barca to fuck off, and unless there was a buyout clause in Suarez's contract that I'm not aware of, there would have been nothing they could've done. The fact that Liverpool didn't do that tell us that this is what was best for the club. Surely they would've liked for Suarez to be madly in love with our club and never think of moving, but he wasn't and he wanted a move. Now the club has two choices, either refuse to sell claiming that Suarez shouldn't have signed a new 5 year deal with us if he didn't want to stay, and a deal is a deal so what are you going to do?

Suarez would be unhappy, possibly creating unrest in the squad, likely there would be a PR war to fight, one that could damage the clubs reputation. If Barca enter this war then that might be their dick move, but they haven't as of yet. The real dick in this case would be Suarez for wanting to break his 5 year contract after just a few months, and possibly Liverpool for forcefully restricting a player who obviously doesn't want to be at the club.

Other option is let him go and get the best possible money from him leaving. This is what Liverpool preferred, and I believe in BR to make the right decision.

I feel bad for this too, and it felt like playing with a rigged deck, just not because of Barca being dicks. Just because I wanted to believe that Suarez would choose Liverpool for at least one more season. When he didn't we had already lost him whether or not we force him to stay.

This would explain his aging during this time with the ""Ponds"" (or when he was away from the for a while before Lake Silencio) vs how he aged when he was on Trenzalore defending Christmas. Of course he didn'e look nearly as aged during the first 300 years on Trenzalore vs. the Master's accelerating 10's age by 100 years, but you could timey-wimey that explanation by saying it was the method by which he was aged (via a laser screwdriver complete with compact Lazarus tech).

I don't think it's that she doesn't trust him. When she's negotiating, she has faith the Doctor is there.

In order to back up you worldview you now literally have to resort to ""WAKE UP SHEEPLE!"" and claim you have the inside scoop on ""The Truth"". 

I'd suggest just giving up the paranoid delusional fantasies to be honest.

Moreno, Lovren, Markovic and Bony/Remy.


I don't really see us getting a big statement signing, all the players that tick that box seem a bit unrealistic after that Q&amp;A with Pearce.


I think all our signings this year are good signings, look at them one by one and it looks pretty good.. Can, Lambert, Lallana, and the ones i already mentioned.

Lambert was cheap, a fan that will give it all, and pretty good goalscorer in PL.

Can has a similar story to Coutinho (not enough playing time in a biiig club, allthough he got loaned out), talented, could take over for Gerrard if he works out.

Lallana expensive, but, nominated for player of the year last season, suits our playing style, presses like a god which will be scary together with Henderson etc.

Markovic and Moreno; like Can; young talents, which if we had waited one more year and they had developed even more we would be at a high risk of ""bigger"" clubs grabbing them next year. Specially Can with Bayerns buy-back and Markovic with Chelsea 50%-ownership-option-to-buy-thing.

Lovren seems expensive and tbh I haven't watched him too much, but I trust rodgers.

Bony/Remy: Want Bony the most, but both proven PL goal scorers, good additions.

If a club knows the player wants to join them then they're obviously going to offer less money to the agent because they know the agent needs to settle for less to please his client. 

Not only that, Pogba only has 2 years left of his contract which means Juve will probably be getting a new deal together because one thing you don't want to do is let the contract run down to one year. With that in mind do you really think his agent would receive a decent fee if he's running around endorsing rumours? No...

It is a historical collection of accounts to be used as a guide and a collection of ideas, not a book of divinely mandated law. I find it a bit frustrating to see people throw Bible quotes around as if they were lawyers in court.

Oh good, the people who say ""Well obviously *that* bit isn't true"" have arrived.

You say *that* bit isn't true and another person says that obviously *this* bit isn't true and another says that obviously *another* part isn't true and I just simply extend that a little bit further and say in fact the entire thing is just a work of fiction.
