Lake Tahoe: Visited 3 times. I love it! Take a power boat out on the lake and its gorgeous

Moab, Utah: Fantastic! Adrenaline sports everywhere, incredible scenery, tons to do, highly recommend for adventurous types.

Yellowstone: Fantastic too! Didn't see many of the rarer wildlife but saw a wild bear. The landscape is just amazing, and if you're into hiking you'll love it.

You mentioned 20-30mins away from the City- Greenwich is a nice area to live in and is in the radius of 30mins commute to EC1V. Another alternative would be the Docklands and property is not bad either. Have friends living there who speak highly of the area. 

Shop around for bank services. You'll need a UK address to be able to open an account so have a council tax or some sort of a utility bill in your name ready when you walk in. Nationwide and Santander may be good options. 

You will need to build up a decent credit report before you will be considered for a mortgage. Credit cards are a good way of doing that. Again, shop around for credit cards to see what suits your specific needs. Imho, look to put down at least 20% (80% LTV) as down payment for property. Rates get better with more down payment you can afford. You may well be able to get 90% LTV thru a decent mortgage broker. Again, shop around for products when you do start looking to purchase. Renting isnt a bad thing as long as you can put some money away for a property. 

I lived near the CIty but moved out as soon as contract was up. Commuting is not too bad once you get used to the rush hour! Most people i know commute by train to the City so bear that in mind when looking for a place to rent.

Each time it's phrased differently, and each time I hear it, I think it's one of the most fundamentally beautiful things I've ever heard.

I've taken every form I've heard and kinda mixed and matched quotes, but whenever I'm giving a talk to a tour group (I do outreach work in my spare time), when I get to stars and why they shine, it's something along the lines of:

""The stars take primordial hydrogen, which formed as the universe cooled itself shortly after time began, and compress it, cook it, into heavier elements. But some of the matter is annihilated, and transformed into light and heat energy. Eventually, the stars explode and die, and scatter those heavy elements all across deep space. After so many billions of years, the ashes of the dead stars coalesce, and form new stars, with the dust making new comets, asteroids, and planets. And on it goes, through out the eons, those same elements form continents and oceans, clouds and rocks, and the even, us. Our atoms come from old stars.""

Yes, we should expect more of our comedians than to go for the 'low hanging fruit' - yet, with UKIP, that's not happening.  IT's also good to see a politician who accepts that it's part of his job to get ripped on by comedians, instead of using the media to discredit them purely because they don't agree with them (see Jimmy Carr vs Gary Barlow on tax avoidance, or simply the number of 'reports' on offensive jokes he's told to a private, paying audience who wanted to see him and knew what they were getting.)

Whereas the Tories get mocked for being posh, and Pickles is a fatty with a funny name, and Miliband is a weird looking socially awkward geek, when it comes to UKIP, they're generally not being mocked for their looks or mannerisms, but because of things they've said, or at worst, things the kind of people they're attracting have said.

I sense that UKIP have it fairly easy, as they haven't had to come out and actually state any policies or real ideas yet, just coming out to the media every now and then and going 'boo, Europe's banning gerbils, Brussels wants to steal your child's pets right out of their tiny hands!' or something about immigrants, doesn't matter what, people only hear 'mumble mumble immigrants bad mumble'.

I think as soon as they put together some policies and they have to actually defend them against criticism, we shall see some interesting stuff.

Of more concern is his finishing when one-on-one with the goalkeeper. He's missed relatively simple chances against Maribor and United, both similar circumstances.

I still have a video clip I took on my phone at the end of the match, while I'm clambering over seats to get onto the pitch. Still like to watch it every now and then, and just remember how it felt.

I still remember how the pitch felt like carpet, and how I vowed I would play there one day. It was a special night. We'd just been through the emotional wringer. A roller-coaster, if you like. It was insane. We went from 1-0 up to 2-1 down on aggregate within 20 minutes. Then there was Milner's penalty... oh man. A bunch of guys on the row in front of me couldn't watch; the guys next to me were all standing arms linked like the team would in the centre circle during a penalty shootout. We didn't even know each other's names, it just felt like we should. When he scored it, we were hugging each other like we'd already won the match.

The team went on to turn it around and then the rest of the match was just... I don't even know. When Ashley Young finished it (and signalled it during his celebration, to make sure everyone knew) we were crying. Legit crying. A group of about six or seven of us, guys I didn't even know, all hugging each other and crying with happiness. It was amazing.

A minute before the whistle, the guys next to me were like ""there's gonna be an invasion here"" and I had this thrill of excitement, because I'd never done it before. I was in the stands for a while, partly nervous at joining in and partly in awe watching this sea of claret and blue scarves and flags pour onto the pitch, cheering wildly. When I realised nobody was going to get into trouble for it, I clambered after them, cackling with glee the whole time, singing Que Sera Sera.

For the first time, I *really* understood why people say Villa Park has an amazing atmosphere. Before that, I'd only really experienced the roar of the crowd at derby matches, or the electric buzz it has when we play Man Utd for example. That night, everything came together. The roars, the buzz, everything. My voice was fucked, and I walked home like I was drunk, even though I hadn't touched the sauce.

false,B23vital,null,null," This will probably get buried here but heres my story:
Im not 100% on the whole immigration, i can see both sides. Like this article states, immigrates come here to make a better life for themselves and yes, they contribute massively to the UK economy, through tax. But you also have to factor in the other sides, those not mentioned in this article. This is my personal opinion of course and is based on what i have seen in my life. 
I work in a factory that employs over 5000 people. They employ over 300k people UK wide and although the majority is british born, there is also a large amount of foreign nationals. 
For example, i work with a lot of people born in Africa, what separates these from EU migrants is that they have come here to work AND live. These people have come here to build themselves a better life, they live in the UK and have family here. Although many of them visit family back at home, they choose to stay here, in the UK, as this is what they call home, they feel safe, secure, they love living here.
But how this compares to the EU migrants is massive. I wont go into every detail about each person i know, but they come from all over the EU. Mainly Poland, Latvia, Bulgaria and Romania. 
These people (now this is general to my experience, so it is not an example of everyone) come here solely to work. They come in on their normal shifts, but practically live in the factory. My shift is 9PM-6AM, Monday to Thursday (no Friday night) but these people will come in 6-6 every day. They do as much overtime as possible, this includes Friday night through to Sunday. Some are known not to go home Friday night, they will work 6-11PM, sleep in their cars, then start work at 6AM through till 2PM, trying to stay over if possible. 
You might ask why this matters and that is there choice, but this does matter and ill explain why. 
One example is a bloke im good friends with, i lift shared for a while with him and he is genuinely a nice man, how ever, he explained to me exactly why he is here, solely to make money. 
He explained how he rents a flat for £450 a month, yet he has a mortgage out on 2 homes that he rents out separately. His plan is to allow the rent to pay for those homes (worth much more than the flat) while saving his money. He explained how he spends little time at home and only shops for essentials, food, clothing ect. He told me his plan was to save up to around £200k to £250k and then move back home. He plans to build a home at a ridiculously cheap price and live with his family. He will work part time back at home and live off of his savings from the UK. His input to the economy is minimal, his home is not what you would class as a home, its more like a cheap hotel. He also explained that 5-10years here could save him more money than he would earn in a lifetime at home. 
Now this is just one story, but there are many more.
Some will argue that he is rightfully entitled to do that, others will argue the case that money is being removed from the economy. Does this make him a bad man? Of course not. He has more courage than i will ever have, leaving home, leaving his family, his children. I couldn't dream of making that sacrifice, but he has done that to better himself and his family. That is precious time he will never get back, but that is his sacrifice. This doesn't make him a bad person, would you not do the same thing if it was your only option?
But the real question is, should it be allowed? 
Should we stop these people coming here freely, working hard to earn a living and take as much money as possible out of our country and into their own. How many people are really doing this? If the figure is huge, then we could be loosing millions, even billions of pounds. 
What sort of knock on effect could this have on younger generations? This job is being filled by someone not from this country, and not spending in this country. Comparing there input into the economy on a whole compared to a British citizen could show real figures on what one person could take from the economy. They are also potentially stopping British citizens from working, as spots being filled by these people are taken away from potential British workers. 
I could go on for days, but this is the issue with immigration. Where do we stand? Immigration is a topic where for every positive point, there is also a negative to counteract it.
Should we help people, provide a platform for them to better themselves and better their families. Or should we choose to help our own, based solely on the fact they were born here?

They added around £20Bn gross between 2001 and 2011, the *net profit* was £4Bn.

The report claims the EU migrants produce a small *net profit* to the state, not a net drain as the likes of UKIP claim.

The point to take away is not that £4Bn is anything amazing, because you rightfully illustrate that it's next to nothing in the grand scheme of things, the point is that EEA migrants are not a net drain at all. Non-EEA migrants are a large net drain (£118Bn) and UK Citizens even larger (£591.5Bn). UK Citizens are the vast majority in the UK and I would reckon the bulk of that drain comes from the likes of pensions and child support, since neither of those two groups are economically active.

Per Capita, we should be closing our doors to almost everyone arriving from outside Europe: non-EU foreign-born represent around 5.2 million people (7.5m total foreign born - 2.3m EU citizens), or 8.1% of our population and yet their net drain of £118Bn is 16.7% of the total net drain (118/705.1).

That having been said though, I do agree with your comments elsewhere in this thread regarding worker's rights and the human element. The living wage *should* be law and the Government *should* be taking steps to legally protect workers from being undercut. The problem is creating those laws while continuing to agree to free movement isn't an easy thing to do, and the EU doesn't want to budge on free movement being limited. 

A living wage would, at least, mean even the lowest paid British worker can live comfortably, meaning undercutting becomes less of an issue (unless you plan on paying illegal wages of course).",0,1415265743,null,0,1415266263,0,cluk9u7,t3_2ldtgp,t1_cluk9u7,t1_clu9jnz,null,1426164920,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Worthing is larger overall but feels a bit more spread out and (in some places) dilapidated. A lot of the shops down Montague street closed down over the last few years (not been back in a good half year) so it can be a bit of a ghost town (oh, thanks NCP parking!)

false,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"I agree that the term has been misused, but in this context - that science and innovation responds to crisis in a fundamentally different way to the previous mode of operation - is exactly the definition that Khun used in his work.

&gt;  If anything, it has been widely discredited, because the vast majority of scientific advancements have been developed on top of each other, on foundations laid over centuries, throughout periods Khun describes as 'normal' or non-revolutionary

Yes, *most science* is non-revolutionary - Khun acknowledges this in the second chapter within the book. The term paradigm shift refers to the concept of a crisis which cannot be explained by the previous theory. To say ""theories develop on top of one another"" is horribly reductionist; there really are moments that occur that completely change the way an established theory is looked at.

Just about all scientific, philosophical and artistic discourse has criticism; simply posting a link to a section of a Wikipedia page is not a reasoned way to discuss something.

&gt; History changes slowly and incrementally. Powder-keg moments, such as the French Revolution or the Bolshevik Coup, are often far less important in the grand scheme of things than changes to societies, economies, and populations over aeons.

The point about revolution is not that the preceding decades are not important they are interconnected. Its like a melting pot that eventually explodes you can't separate the system states from one another.

To take the Russian revolutions as an example - this was the consequence of about two decades of political and economic strife that boiled over in a strike over food during a war. You can say that incremental change led up to it. But to imply that the revolution was not an important moment is like saying ""the explosion wasn't important; it was the chain of events that led to munitions being loaded into the tank"".",0,1415268990,null,0,false,0,clukv40,t3_2ldvil,t1_clukv40,t1_clu6o41,null,1426164645,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;The truth is that Britain’s housing crisis is almost entirely about the use of land, which is determined largely by planning policy. A hectare of agricultural land on the edge of Oxford may cost £6,000-£10,000. Similar land with planning permission can be worth £4 million. 

&gt;That huge gap is what encourages land speculation, and so creates many of the problems Mr Spiers raises about the state of the building industry. Since only a small amount of developable land is released each year by councils, developers compete entirely at the point when they are buying land, rather than at the point when they are selling the homes they build. 

&gt;The firms that survive are the ones with the best access to finance, rather than the firms which build the nicest houses.

The anxiety got so bad that I was experiencing symptoms of a brain tumour that were simply my imagination playing tricks on me. I went to the doctors a few times and she identified right away that it was stress related anxiety, and despite being as rational as I can be in other area's of life, I threw away 2 medical professionals views on the matter and went back to believing I was seriously ill.

Also make yourself aware of IR35 and its implications - as you are both contracting, you may consider setting up a single limited company and both contract out of that. Makes you seem like a more legitimate business than a 'disguised employee'.

Max tax efficiency comes from a limited company, a good accountant and sensible choices.

**Price of product:** £5.00 (Boots)

**Product Claims:** Freederm Gel is an anti-inflammatory spot treatments. It contains an anti-inflammatory active ingredient - nicotinamide - which has been clinically proven to help get rid of inflamed red spots. These are the ones that are reddish-coloured, usually tender, and sometimes have pus in them.

**About you:** Dry, acne-prone skin. I get occasional pimples but I get hard stiff nodules that stay for a couple weeks (or months) after first appearance. I bought this because I wanted to test niacinamide and see if I could stop my face from breaking out.
 
**Your opinion:** It's a very tiny tube that has a very viscous gel. For such a tiny tube, it really takes a lot of product to apply to cover the entire face. As per suggestions on this subreddit, I've taken a half of a pea of freederm and mixed it with a pea of moisturiser. This mixture spreads on as easily as regular lotion and is only barely tacky on the skin. I can apply makeup over this mixture but I cannot apply makeup over undiluted freederm (that shit is too tacky!). My face has cleared up considerably, and even during my period I have not seen a single pimple. I have some nodules that have appeared a day or two after I first started. They're still handing about. I will see if this completely stops nodules. A prescription version can be had at £8 for 60mg. I would not buy this product again at £5.00 per 10mg; if I saw it on sale, I would buy it and just use it for travel.

**Ingredients**: Nicotinamide 4% w/w.Aluminium Magnesium Silicate, Hypromellose, Citric Acid, Macrogol Lauryl Ether, Ethanol, Purified Water.

Not all schools do that. At least they didn't when I went to school, I don't know if standards have changed. It would be good if they have.

I never really didn't want to join, my Dad joined shortly after he was married so when I was growing up being in the orange hall wasn't alien as it is to a lot of people, going to barbecues, social evenings, and youth clubs. He taught me about the history of it and I had a read through the rulebook before I joined and thought it was a good thing to be a part of.

&gt;Are there many members who feel strongly about improving community relations? 

Yes, what benefit is it to us of we aren't welcome in the community we live in? None of our halls have been really attacked in recent years, bar a few wee shits putting a window in. Bessbrook has always been a mixed village and there was never any issues until recently. Outside of my district, in Newry there's David Hanna MBE, who's done great things and the Grand Secretary Drew Nelson, Dromore, is flat out, he addressed the Dial a few years back. Then of course there's the work of the grand lodge education officer.

&gt;Is it true that a lot of members are masons and if so is there an esoteric element within orangism also? 

There is an overlap of membership in some cases, freemasonry never had the same draw on Ireland as it had elsewhere especially amongst Protestants. Any one who cares to legitimately look into Orangeism can easily understand it. 

&gt;How do you honestly view the pope and Catholicism in general, do you believe they will all burn in hell?

Catholicism as a doctrine is contrary to the scriptures and the Pope is peddling something that is essentially lies. The Bible says it is through Faith by God's grace alone that we are saved, not be deeds works or any sacraments. Is it possible for a Catholic who has faith in the sacraments and the particular position they give the Eucharist, and their pantheon of saints to get into heaven? I'd say no. A Catholic who's faith is firmly rooted in Christ's death upon the cross and the saving grace that flowed therefrom, yes, but at that stage you have to ask if they are really a catholic. Protestant churches are filled with people who aren't Christians and that's a shame but it normally isn't anything to do with the pulpit.",0,1415271959,null,0,false,0,clule4e,t3_2ldscd,t1_clule4e,t1_cltvh99,null,1426164398,8,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,8

It is very difficult to explain to someone who doesn't suffer from anxiety exactly what it is and what's going on. I've only suffered from it the last few years and the feelings are some of the most powerful I've ever gone through. Especially if you start getting anxiety attacks. I thought people who had this were just being, I dunno, daft. I just couldn't empathise with them because it wasn't happening to me. 

Thing is though, it's not a joke. It's very real. 

People say to me ""What exactly have you got to be stressed about?"" but ( with me ) it's not actually caused by stress, the feelings just come from literally nowhere. One minute I'm sitting relaxed and I'm fine, the next I'm in full on fight, flight or freeze mode ( and you can't run from yourself ) thinking something is very wrong and I'm using all of my mental energy just to calm myself down. 



The positive thing is though that it is manageable and doesn't have to be such an issue. You just have to basically reprogram yourself to stop the negative thinking process. I've go to CBT which really helps reassure me that there's actually nothing wrong. I also take beta blockers to stop my adrenaline going into overdrive on its own at the first sign of trouble. 

The good thing is I'm definitely managing it much better than I was a year ago. For sure.

Makes sense to me. The trouble is that he also seemed to want to recreate these regions in the image of the US. That would be a reasonably good outcome, but not the best possible outcome. 

&gt;As for why I think what he says is generally on the money, a world that is interconnected by trade and where nuclear war exists as a possibility is good for capital and its good for us. We live in the most peacful, stable period of human history where quality of life has never been better.

That's all true. But it's so good for capital that the control or ownership of all the profitable stuff is ending up in the hands of a small well connected elite who have far too much influence. This isn't good for everyone else. In the end it won't be good for the small well connected elite either, because there won't be enough people to buy their goods and services, and there won't be enough profitable investment opportunities for them. We can see this happening already: there's been far too much capital chasing far too small ROI for decades.

Yes he's made some mistakes but look at LVG or Rodgers in his first season, it takes time to change the mentality of a team and that's what I think Poch is trying to do, mistakes will be made, it's about addressing them and looking to improve. The one thing I like about Poch is he never seems satisfied and is constantly looking to improve. 

People will have the knives out again if he doesn't start Kane at the weekend, especially the press because he's English, but I remember the pressure AVB was under when Townsend hit form, he bowed to the pressure and ended up starting him every game, his form soon fizzled out and he still hasn't got it back. I have no problem with Poch's selections or rotation, the only criticism I have is making Kaboul captain and undroppable, think Lloris was the better candidate. 

He needs time and support, he got a 5 year deal for that exact reason. I have no expectations of top 4 this year, hope we have a decent cup run but more importantly I hope the players continue to improve as the season goes on and buy into Poch's philosophy. He also needs another transfer window or two to add the players he wants. For now, we desperately need some stability, then this time next year we can start to judge him.

I can only see it as not a discrimination issue if the shop has a history of banning marriage, celebration, cartoon characters or colour designs, which hasn't been mentioned in this case yet. It does look like they have singled out this one cake based on it's subject matter on homosexuality. So does this mean they wont make any cakes with context of homosexuality?

This business is not advertised as strongly Christian or its values for its customers to know if they'll be refused cakes on this basis. This is taking point to the extreme but we can't have businesses go back to the days of 'no dogs, no Irish, no black' style signs or limits to who they serve.

Ukip has [expanded rapidly in the last two years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Independence_Party#Membership) from 20,000 to 40,000. In this massive increase in membership some nutters have joined HOWEVER when these people get unearthed they get kicked out. Nutters are not only the preserve of UKIP as /u/7zark77 points out [here in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2lgp9p/stewart_lee_the_imaginary_liberal_comedy_cabal/clulw0a).

What I really find staggering is that people who *say* they are anti-prejudice are judging a lot of people based on the bad behavior of a few, which is from my experience the root of all prejudice. I'm not a supporter of UKIP but what really annoys me is that people who are against UKIP rarely take on their basic arguments about the European union or immigration.  Instead we get this ""if you are against immigration you are against immigrants"" ""anti uncontrolled immigration from failing european economies? you must be racist"". I know Stewart Lee is a comedian but he is symptomatic of a larger problem amongst UKIPs critics and that's a failure to take on the argument and instead just insinuate racism. Play the worst players and not the ball.  This is why the UKIP critics are losing the debate and I'm still waiting on UKIP critics to realise why.

EDIT 1: formatting

EDIT 2: add the following

To put UKIP party membership in context 

Labour: 190,00
Conservative:174,000
Liberal Democrats 43,000
Ukip: 40,00
Green party 32,000 

Note:( numbers from Wikipedia rounded to nearest 1,000. Green parties numbers are English, Welsh and Scottish parties combined)

It should be noted that Ukip tend to attract people who feel disenfranchised by mainstream politics - so yeah there's going to be nutters but my main point (summerised in the TL;DR) is still the same.

**TL;DR - UKIP is dealing with it's nutter problem but UKIP's critics are NOT dealing with UKIP's basic political arguments**

* BT always offers you the best speed possible on your line. Typically 80% of customers receive speeds within or above this range. The speed prediction we have given here is an estimate, however download speeds can vary and the actual download speed will fall within a range. The BT broadband range is an indication of the speed that other similar lines across the UK have achieved for their broadband service.

The actual speed depends on several factors such as the product option you choose, the processing power of your computer, how many people are using your broadband connection at the same time, whether you use a wireless or cable connection, the speed of the websites that you visit and the performance of our network.

false,dougie_g,eng-berkshire,Berkshire,"So many people say 'these protests have no demands, they're just rent a mobs', or things to that effect. It doesn't seem to dawn that there is obviously a massive disaffection with our political system. 

The problem is that they are told to go home and try to change things within the framework of the current system. Young people, and a lot of others, don't want to do that. They want to be heard, yes, but what they are saying is that it is the system itself that is broken. 

Parties like UKIP do well because they are made up of traditional politicians. Establishment people who have done very well under the current system. They know how to game it. Doesn't make than any more a part of the problem than the other big parties, but the fact is that people with more right wing, traditional views tend to be supportive of the establishment and willing to operate within its boundaries. 

The issue, in my opinion, is that no group has actually taken up leadership. Maybe that's because it is pointless - I bet that there were thousands of political views there that completely contradicted one another. But I'm pretty sure that there is a possibility for cohesion on certain issues like voting reform, social welfare, and tuition fees. Some people who are against the system but who also know how to operate within it need to step up and have the charisma to harness this support. Nick Clegg did it to some extent, it can't be impossible. 

The problem is that these young people are impliedly told that they are lazy, they are useless, they have to work unpaid for a year before a chance at a good job. They have a right to be angry. But the fact that they lash out in big groups in a general fashion against 'capitalism' is because they have nowhere to direct their anger and focus it. Literally the *entire system* is now rigged so that young people are screwed with piles of debt and then can't get a job unless they are lucky enough to know somebody, or get picked out of a pool of thousands for a graduate job. 

Somehow that anger needs to be focused or it will manifest unproductively. The vast majority of the people there probably weren't violent, but the riots showed that it is bubbling under the surface. If something doesn't change then in twenty years we will have half of an entire generation who have had no skills or paid work for a significant proportion of their lives. 

Basically somebody, some organisation or group, needs to emerge as productively working for these people. Sure as hell not a single political party is. Young people have always been easy targets for politicians, which just creates more anger and mistrust, meaning they don't vote, meaning that they get screwed even harder.

Dismissing them as unwashed hippies is very short sighted, and is likely to cause a lot of problems in the long run. ",0,1415280068,null,0,false,0,clunbjn,t3_2lgjab,t1_clunbjn,t3_2lgjab,null,1426163499,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

After this and other tortures he was left to pass the night with his hands and feet bound together, like a ball, so sleep would be difficult. During the following three days, he was repeatedly mocked and hung on a pole with his hands tied behind his back. Then a weight of 300 metric pounds (150 kg) was attached to each of his big toes for half an hour. After this half hour Gérard was fitted with shoes made of well-oiled, uncured dog skin; the shoes were two fingers shorter than his feet. In this state he was put before a fire. When the shoes warmed up, they contracted, crushing the feet inside them to stumps. When the shoes were removed, his half-broiled skin was torn off. After his feet were damaged, his armpits were branded. After that he was dressed in a shirt soaked in alcohol. Then burning bacon fat was poured over him and sharp nails were stuck between the flesh and the nails of his hands and feet. Gérard is said to have remained calm during his torture.

In Northern Ireland, political opinions are a protected characteristic under equality law, so I don't *think* the legal situation would be very different in that case.  I don't know what the case law is like - maybe you could get away with a ""no political party cakes"" policy as long as you treated different parties equally, or something like that.  The main point of equality laws is to try and discourage segregation and ghettoisation, so it makes perfect sense that the laws would protect nationalists and unionists in Northern Ireland.

&gt; What about a pro abortion cake? Again to take it to an extreme, some ""lower the age of consent"" cake.

These hypotheticals don't really correspond to treating people differently on the basis of protected characteristics (except political opinions) in the same way that the case in question does.  How about if a bakery agreed to produce ""let white women have abortions"" cakes but not ""let black women have abortions"" cakes?  Surely there would be a very strong argument for racial discrimination there.  Age is a protected characteristic, but only for adults IIRC.  Again, I don't really know how the political opinions characteristic would apply to these kinds of cases.

The reason it is hard to think of a plausible analogy is because we are in a really weird situation where the government still routinely discriminates against LGBT people but has passed laws banning private organizations from doing so.  People with other protected characteristics may be treated unfairly by the government, but it's hard to think of any blatant examples of them specifically being excluded from rights that everybody else has.

&gt; It's quite right that you can't discriminate against gay people, but I don't think its 100% clear that this is.

Presumably the Equality Commission think there is a strong argument that it is.  It depends what exactly the bakery's policy was, and what exactly they said to the customers.  Maybe it falls under political discrimination, maybe there is evidence that they treated the customers differently directly because of their sexual orientation, or maybe it falls under indirect discrimination (i.e., policies that don't specifically target a protected characteristic, but still cause particular harm to people who share one, for example banning turbans causes particular problems for Sikhs).",0,1415280834,null,0,false,0,clunkcy,t3_2lgehv,t1_clunkcy,t1_clumjvd,null,1426163385,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

&gt;This is the key point. It doesn't matter to your average voter whether the UK economy is £20bn better off. It sounds like a lot of money but it's miniscule dent in the budget.

So stop telling me ""facts"". I don't care that the economy has £20bn more in tax receipts. It really is a miniscule amount of money in the grand scheme of things. Using money as the only indicator for sucesss is a terrible idea. There is MUCH more going on than simply adding up tax reciepts.

&gt;Yes, Poles are in majority as Poles are the biggest European immigration group so every time there is a topic of ""let's limit EU migration"" it mostly applies to Poles!

That is a terrible use of logic and reasoning. On all the topics about immigration I have not seen anybody specifically mention Polish people. The only time I hear Polish people being mentioned is when they are talked of positively for their hard work. Why the fuck do you keep going on about Polish people? Nobody is talking about Polish people.

&gt;so what's the big fuss for?

I think that to start an internationally competitive business, it helps a great deal to have other similar businesses nearby.

The issue is, it's very difficult to imagine any one city coming to prominence in that role - it would require massive expansion into nearby countryside, and also massive national-level investment in transport and infrastructure, which would be politically impossible on both counts.

So what you are left with is looking for clusters of cities that can be connected together to form a single functional city-region, where it's realistic to live in one city, and commute to the other (and also get to social gatherings, conferences, other businesses etc). And this is where we get to the problem, when people complain about a lack of investment in other parts of the country. There are only a few places in where there is potential to achieve this*, and focusing investment there is likely to lead to much greater benefit for the country and for future citizens than elsewhere. People ultimately have to decide whether their priority is whether their kids live in the same city/town/village as where they grew up, or whether they have a better chance at a good career (and also at providing the tax revenue which can support pensions, social care, healthcare etc in the long run), but live 50-150 miles away.

false,Evis03,cnty-uk,Welshman-on-Mersey,"Something I posted elsewhere:

This year, the Royal British Legion adopted Green Fields of France as its song. The only problem? They decided that they wouldn't bother using the last verse. And given that the song in many ways revolves around that last verse, it pretty much kills the song.

So why do it?

Quite possibly because the last verse is a tacit statement that war is bad and keeps happening. Can't have that can we. Why not though?

Why should the RBL care about a piece of music that says war is a bad thing? The song doesn't blame individual soldiers. The song doesn't condemn any one person or group of persons. The essence of the song is ""this is some fucked up shit and it doesn't stop happening"".

Of course this requires us all to focus on an unpleasant possibility, dare I say truth. That remembrance day is no longer about remembrance. It's now become a carrier for pro war mentality.

In order to make any controversial political decision palatable, the easiest way is to break it down into the smallest, most human concept you can imagine, something that no one could possibly object to in good faith. For example ""We need these surveillance powers to protect children from pedophiles."" War is being handled in the exact same way. In America the attitude is ""Well you support the troops don't you?"" Troops are human. They are people shipped off to who knows where to fight and die. It's hard not to sympathize with someone 'just doing their job' (Even if it's conceptually only one step shy of 'just obeying orders'). So then when someone challenges the war, all you need to do is point out that means they don't support the troops- and suddenly that person looks (and more importantly will often FEEL) like they're slagging off a bunch of people everyone likes. Fill in the rest for yourself.

We have honored our war dead for a long time. This provides the perfect in for this concept of breaking down war to the human level. Can you imagine a group of people walking down the streets of London waving placards saying that the soldiers of the Great War were a bunch of murders, rapists and thugs? Probably not. The problem is that reverence (deserved or not) towards the war dead is easily manipulated into applying to the living as well. And then you have to 'support the troops', which is basically supporting the war as far as political approval goes.

I have no opinion on soldiers and the military as a job/role. I know soldiers and reservists. Some are cunts. Some are nice people. But as 'soldiers' I don't regard them as heroes. I don't regard them as hired killers. I regard them as another group of people doing what they can and using the skills they have to try and make their way in the world. Nothing more. And certainly nothing less.

But to present the military as anything less than heroes and to actually acknowledge that war is a really terrible thing is to reveal the man behind the curtain. With only a little thought outside of what is 'permitted' (socially if not legally) people can very easily see the Wizard of Oz for what he truly is. Encouraging such thought will more often than not encourage action AGAINST the war, the last thing the government wants.

So they took a war song- and sanitized it.

To sanitize an artists words for political profit is a very disturbing action. That political profit is also, in an of itself, immoral and insulting to all servicemen and women, living and dead, as well as the British public at large.

This is not the action of an organization caring for and supporting the sacrifice of our soldiers. It is the action of a propaganda machine and the RBL cannot hold its head high while it conducts such disgraceful activities.

A few years ago I made the conscious decision to no longer wear the Poppy. I still made contributions to the RBL as I believe that we have a responsibility to those we allow our government to send to war.

Next year I honestly don't know if I will even offer money. Not while the RBL is releasing propaganda like this. I may believe in paying to support the people that we helped mangle- but I am vehemently opposed to this sort of propaganda. I may even take up the White Poppy.

No it doesn't, because the Equality Commission, who presumably have a good understanding of equality law, clearly think the bakery's actions were illegal, and it sounds as though the courts will end up ruling one way or the other.

&gt; The question here is whether or not a person making a cake is allowed to decide what kind of cake they make. The content of the cake really has no bearing here.

That isn't how the relevant laws work.  It's about whether your policies specifically single out people who have a protected characteristic (or people who are perceived to have one, or people who associate with people who do) for inferior treatment, whether the policies cause particular problems for people who have a protected characteristic (regardless of whether they are intended to), and whether the policies are a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim.

No, there are two huge, objective differences.

&gt;Conclusion
This article has discussed how money is created in the modern
economy. Most of the money in circulation is created, not by
the printing presses of the Bank of England, but by the
commercial banks themselves: banks create money whenever
they lend to someone in the economy or buy an asset from
consumers. And in contrast to descriptions found in some
textbooks, the Bank of England does not directly control the
quantity of either base or broad money. The Bank of England
is nevertheless still able to influence the amount of money in
the economy. It does so in normal times by setting monetary
policy — through the interest rate that it pays on reserves held
by commercial banks with the Bank of England. More
recently, though, with Bank Rate constrained by the effective
lower bound, the Bank of England’s asset purchase programme
has sought to raise the quantity of broad money in circulation.
This in turn affects the prices and quantities of a range of
assets in the economy, including money.",0,1415283819,null,0,false,0,cluontl,t3_2lfv8k,t1_cluontl,t1_cluni33,null,1426162794,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

2) The roles could have been reversed and *he* could have been the one driven mad instead of the Master.  A mad Doctor ""fixing"" people...that's kinda scary.

5) He could be a family man first and foremost, with a wife and children on the TARDIS.  Heck, it's big enough for an entire colony in there.

* Does the router get turned off at any point for more than few minutes?

No they are not. The principle IS simple. You can only take action if you’re treated differently because of a protected characteristic. Only People can have protected characteristics, not cakes.

Would the customer have been served if they had asked for a different cake? If yes, then there is no discrimination.

Would a straight customer have been served the cake with the gay message? If no then there is no discrimination. 

Again, you cannot discriminate against a cake, only against a person, and thee is absolutely no evidence that this happened.

The equalities commission might be investigating, but that does not mean they are guilty of discrimination any more than someone undergoing trial is a guilty criminal.

When he gets let in, later on, he realises that the wardrobe is too big to try everything on himself, so gets Kryton to do a time jump to pick up another copy of him. Kryton somehow gets the Chameleon Arch involved and ends up picking up another *female* version of Cat – they spend so long in the wardrobe that they evolve another entire civilization etc in there and only the last survivor gets out at the end – a new but identical Cat.

Lister initially gets the hots for the girl companion, but also wants to go back to find Kochanski – maybe by way of planet New New Liverpool, where they have curry swamps and lager lakes… 

Rimmer gets sexytime feelings when he’s scanned by the Sonic, and so spend the whole episode dreaming up more bizarre reasons that he needs to be scanned.

Holly is jealous of the TARDIS, but gloats that she doesn’t have a voice or face interface, so spends time putting makeup on, dressing up, and making snarky remarks. An Idris like hologram shows up at the end and puts Holly in his place.

When the Doctor agrees to take them back Rimmer screws it up, causes them to overshoot to a Black and White historical. He ends up killing Marco Polo before he got famous which leads – via a convolutes chain of events - to the earth becoming a Dalek colony when they do get back to their “original” time on Earth. He then gets processed somehow to become the crippled Rimros, stuck in a hardlight half-Dalek – and still a second class technician cleaning out nutrient dispensers. Kryton, meanwhile gets his spare head confused with a cyberwoman as a result of an interrupted bout of implied cyber-rumpy-pumpy in a cyber ghetto.

The Doctor then disconnects them from the Better Than Life interface and tells them that is part of the reason that he can’t take them back at all. He then says that the other part is because they are going to be part of a fixed point in time, which (and he checks his watch) is coming up soon and would be too painful for him to watch, so bye!

false,TranshumansFTW,eng-dorset,Dorset Expat in Aus,"I think the point is that when people are apparently positioning themselves against a perceived inequality, whether their comments are racist or not they're still going to be considered progressive. Similarly, when a person is apparently positioning themselves so they are assisting a perceived inequality, they're generally called racist regardless of what was actually said.

This is because the term ""racism"" has evolved so that it's subtly different from ""racially-motivated discrimination"". However, first we need to define what discrimination actually means.

* **Discrimination:** *The recognition and understanding of differences between one thing and at least one other thing.*

For example, by noting that circles possess one edge and squares possess four, I am discriminating between shapes based on the number of edges. Discrimination is not inherently a bad thing, since everyone does it every day - I discriminated between flours to use when cooking pancake batter for example. However, when it is applied to humans and used to justify an inequality or perceived inequality based on inherent characteristics of age, race, sex, sexuality etc, it is typically seen as negative.

So, we could well define my own new term of ""racially-motivated discrimination"" as:

* *A discrimination between the characteristics or cultures of two or more people based on the races of those people*

And this would eliminate the perceived negative context around the word discrimination. This context should instead be applied to the word racism, which is universally negative in meaning an implies an inherent inequality or injustice based on race between the people.

For example, can you spot the racist statement versus the neutrally discriminatory statement?

IIRC they didn't refuse to house them on the grounds that they were gay. They told the couple that because they were unmarried, they would be put into two single rooms. This is a practice that they did with any unmarried couple, gay or straight, for 25 years, and were always upfront about the policy. The gay couple refused to accept the policy, and left of their own volition.

&gt; “Our double-bed policy was based on our sincere beliefs about marriage, not hostility to anybody. It was applied equally and consistently to unmarried heterosexual couples and homosexual couples, as the judge accepted,” she told media.

That said, just some general physics-y tips: the most efficient thing you can possibly do is heat exactly the right amount of water to exactly the right temperature exactly before you're about to use it.

I would turn the faucet and heater off, then drain the hot water tank to about halfway (60L should be plenty for a shower, and this will prevent you heating unnecessary water). Then start experimenting! Turn the heater on, and 15 minutes later turn it off, turn the pump on and take a shower. Too cold? Then next time do it for 30 minutes. Nice temperature? See if you can get away with 8 minutes. See if you can find the exact amount of time you need to run the heater before you shower. Then after you shower, turn the faucet on to refill the tank to halfway again.

These are just the thoughts of a physicist, I'm sure someone with more experience will say everything is wrong about this!

EDIT: Just worked out - if your immersion heater is 3kW (as is usual) and the ambient temperature is 15 degrees, it will need to be on for a minimum of 35 minutes a day to get your showers to 40C. Anything less than that is physically impossible. Of course, in the summer this will be less, and in the winter it will be more, as the water needs heating up less/more respectively.

Teams that win have a unified philosophy (or they spend half a billion putting players on the pitch - unfortunately this will not cease to work any time soon.) 

Last year we had that singular vision and purpose. The team was of one mind and everything was clicking. Our midfielders knew what our strikers wanted, we pressed as a unit, our counter-attack was fluid and terrifying. Rodgers had every manager in the league shitting his pants. Only Mourinho had the wit and the balls to take a more expensive team and tell them to park the bus. Say what you want, that fuckface knows how to win, and that setup has been the calling card of practically every team we've played since.

Here's what people forget: that fluidity, that understanding, that beautiful link up play... took about *a year and a half* for Rodgers to teach that group of players. Remember back when we thought Henderson was a near-useless waste of money? Remember when we played *exactly as we are playing now* when Rodgers started in 2012? Remember how that shit run turned into the best team of players we've seen in a decade a year and a half later? 14 game winning streak?

No, people forget. Supporters are interested in the short term and can't understand why half a dozen new players (and 55/110 of our PL goals leaving or getting injured) aren't playing like last year's finely tuned machine. Get your heads out of your asses because this team is going to be amazing. In two years we will be the most feared team in England, just like last year, except this time with depth. The world will see the prices at which we bought these players and kick themselves for missing out. We will be bursting with **talented players in their prime, running Rodgers' winning system.**

The side Rodgers fielded against Real Madrid was the first time in a while we saw a team with a unified philosophy. Rodgers started youth that could press for 60-70 minutes, then sub in our playmakers, who allowed too many defensive holes STARTING in the first leg, but could snipe the game coming on late. 

We almost pulled it off, and it was because of a defined vision that the players are learning quickly (at a MUCH faster rate than the first batch of players, thanks in part to these players being brought in to fit our style, save for Balotelli).

Rodgers knows what he's doing. FSG knows what they're doing. To the fair weathered fans and those who don't see the big picture at the club, I say good riddance. We're about long-term success here, even if that means pissing off supporters in the short term, because honestly, supporters don't know what the fuck they're talking about. 

Put on the blinders and stick to what you know will work. Fuck ""supporters"" that have no idea what's actually being built here. They'll all come running back in 2 years when we win the league and they'll claim they weren't here spewing shit in a time of necessary transition towards sustained European and domestic success.",0,1415290018,null,0,false,0,clurob4,t3_2lgw2m,t1_clurob4,t3_2lgw2m,null,1426161318,215,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,215

A media conglomerate is what created the meme, not government.

“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses.

The practice of singing to the players and team in a unique way is generally not as wide spread. While some teams have their own songs, the majority of chants are something along the lines of ""here we go, X team, here we go!"" or ""De-fense! De-fense!"" For the most part, they are very clean. While drunk kids at a university do their fair share of cussing, you're not going to have a full stadium screaming about how the shits from Spurs bought Willian's flight. In addition, long play stoppages are very common in American sports, and practically non-existent in football. As such, the dynamic of crowd is often much different, as they are not consistently cheering for 45 straight minutes per half.

My intention here is not to rip on American sports. I moved to America a long time ago and have grown to enjoy sports like Basketball and Handegg. However, the dynamics of the game are very different. Besides, while the supporters weren't on their A-game against QPR, Stamford Bridge can get ear-bleedingly loud. Watch our ill-fated match against Atletico Madrid last campaign. While we lost, the supporters sang from first moment to last, never wavering despite the score, and nearly brought the stadium down.

It depends on context, and how you conceptualise the noun. E.g. 'The government is formed of the majority parliamentary party.' Here, we're talking about the concept of the government, not necessarily individual people in it. But, I could say 'the government are acting like a bunch of school children!'. In this case, my brain is thinking about the behaviour of the individuals that comprise the group.

With your example, we would say 'Man U are leading/flagging/going for a penalty', because we're talking about the individual players on the field at that time. But, if we were talking about the club as an entity, then it's singular. E.g. 'Man U has just signed such and such a player'. 

The rules aren't strict, but that's the general idea. It's however the speaker wants to conceptualise it. 

However, we don't do it with countries! UK is a kingdom - we always see it as singular. If we wanted talk about the collective, we'd say 'the British'.

From: http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/celtic/celtic-to-play-racing-club-on-50th-anniversary-of-shame-games-187477n.25787234

The legendary three-game encounter between the Hoops - European Cup winners in 1967 - and Copa Libertadores holders Racing was one of the most bruising series of games in football history.

 Celtic won the first leg at Hampden Park in front of 103,000 fans, thanks to a Billy McNeill strike in a game marred by Jimmy Johnstone being spat on by away players.

 In the return leg watched by 100,000 in Racing's El Cilindro ground, Celtic crashed to a 2-1 defeat despite a Tommy Gemmell opener. 

Keeper Ronnie Simpson missed the game after being hit by a missile before the kick-off and Celtic's dressing room was invaded by home fans after the final whistle.

 Celtic debated whether to forfeit the deciding third game in Montevideo three days later but eventually agreed to play it after Jock Stein insisted.

 A Paraguayan referee lost the plot and sent off a staggering four Celtic players, although Bertie Auld refused to leave the pitch and was allowed to stay on!

 Celtic eventually lost 1-0 but the Uruguayan crowd lobbed missiles at the Racing players on their lap of honour.

 Incredibly, Celtic fined their own players £250 each, while the Argentinians were rewarded with a £2500 bonus and a new car.",0,1415291250,null,0,false,0,clusd05,t3_2lh78h,t1_clusd05,t1_clus9zf,null,1426160998,2,false,ScottishFootball,t5_2sba4,2

If Aston Martin said 'we do not paint our cars pink, just because you are willing to pay does not mean we are entitled to do it', I think that's fair enough. If they said 'we would normally be happy to paint a car pink, but because the customer is someone we don't like, we are going to refuse to', that is discriminatory.

/u/simanthropy I think your suggestion is quite good given that I can find out the element bit. My husband will be her in a month so maybe then it will be sensible to heat the whole tank (it is 3w indeed). Thankfully, the tank is located in a small hall with double doors - into the bathroom and out into the living room- and it has an insulation jacket on, so even when I've only had it on for 40 mins at night, next morning the water is still lukewarm. 

I've read many confusing things about whether it's better to leave on the whole time, or only when needed. Previous tenant had the timer set to heater on four hours in the morning (5-9) and 4 hours at night (6-10) - that seems excessive to me. 

So what I'm mainly looking for is advice on how to combine the heater/pump - how much will it cost me to run the pump for 15 minutes twice a day for example, and heat the whole tank once a day as well?

false,seemylolface,lfc12,,"It didn't take a year and a half.  It took 1/2 to 2/3 of the first season he was in charge.  We went on quite a tear in the second half of the 12/13 season and played really good football there.  That football came from a change in how we played too, we abandoned the possession game we were initially trying with Rodgers and went for a more vicious attacking and counterattacking style.  The possession play wasn't quite working for us and Rodgers changed things to suit the players he had.

Yes, we brought in a lot of new players this season.  However we only lost 2 of our big players from last season though (Agger and Suarez).  The core should still be there and should still know what they're doing, but it seems they've forgotten.  We should be able to integrate 2-4 new starters into the fold, especially out of the players we bought because their skillsets match what we seem to want to do with our play very well, without nearly the kind of hiccups we've been having.  

My theory for why we've looked so bad is that we've changed our philosophy again.  Changed it from what brought us success over the past season and a half back to what we were trying to do for the first 4-5 months Rodgers was in charge.  We're not playing counterattacking football anymore, we're not looking to jump the other team and roll them over right out of the gate.  We've abandoned that for what looks like patient possession, but in doing so we seem to have neutered our ability to play fast and play forward.  We are not playing the system that Rodgers won so much with last season or the tail end of the 12/13 season right now and we're suffering because of it.  We lost Suarez and then brought in a player who couldn't be more different from him in Balotelli, and then asked that player to do a job he's never been good at in his entire career (play as a lone striker).  That's going to cause some serious problems while it gets worked out.

Whether this new (or rather, revisiting of the original BR style, that he then changed pretty drastically to suit the players) style can bring us success and results like we saw last season remains to be seen.  On how the season has gone so far I don't think it's unfair to be skeptical or want to go back to what we were doing so well before.  We want results and we want the system that works best for the players to go out and get those results.  We never had amazing results with BR's possession game and really only exploded into form when we dropped that in favor of the aggression and fast counter play we showed last season.

So yea, we're skeptical.  We are that way because of what we've seen in the past 2+ years with Rodgers.  We're confused about why we'd walk away from a winning setup for something that seems to not suit our players.  It makes them look flat, dull, and uninspired.  It's not fun to watch and it's been happening over and over again this season.  At first it was ""judge us after 10 games, the season is young"" and now that we've hit 10 league games but sit 7th with 0 GD, people are saying ""you can't judge us after only 10 game"" ... which is it?  I think we're in trouble and there aren't signs of improvement in our performances.  What little glimmers of good play (such as the goals against West Brom) seem like isolated events because they don't happen regularly like they should.

To me, Rodgers is being stubborn this season so far.  It almost feels like he's trying to jam a square block into a round hole.  But he's shown us over the past 2 seasons that he can be creative and flexible with his tactics and team setups.  I think he needs to rediscover that, and I think he will do eventually.",0,1415292253,null,0,false,0,clusxor,t3_2lgw2m,t1_clusxor,t1_clurob4,null,1426160730,36,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,36

But if I chose 8.4 and no-one else did it's a win/point?

Didn't let the 10 lowest unique numbers bit sink in. So it's more about guesstimating what the lowest number no-one will have picked is?

I think the biggest failures have been missing our *biggest* targets each transfer window. We might be singing a very different tune right now with Sanchez on the pitch, but a lot of foreigners want to live in London instead of doing what's best for their careers. Fuck 'em.

Have we been unlucky with new players not adjusting? Yes. Does that mean we should lose our patience as supporters? NO. I'm not going to sit here and tell you it's all rainbows and unicorn farts because it's not. We all know the side has problems.

What I do resent is the notion that everything Rodgers and the team did last year is irrelevant and Rodgers is now a tactical idiot who can't motivate or teach players. You're personally not saying that, but that was the point of my post: supporters miss the big picture, which is VERY POSITIVE for us right now but no one fucking cares because we're in a bad run of form, which happens to everyone but Bayern apparently.

Think about it this way: Rodgers comes in, we all set the expectation of CL in 3-4 years. This is a massive rebuilding project coming back from the brink of administration. Rodgers beats expectations by 1-2 years. Everyone praises him, then forgets because we hit the reset button with Suarez in an attempt to build a team for the LONG TERM that can DOMINATE THE LEAGUE for the next DECADE. Isn't that what we all want? I'm saying that what we've done is exactly what gives us a chance at doing that, but fans don't give a shit because we're momentarily losing and that pisses me off.

Will all the signings work out? No, of course not. But buying youth that will enter their prime WITH US is exactly what will bring us success.

To your last point, Rodgers is a risky manager tactically. I think this is great in the long run, and always gives us a chance to win, especially against big teams. And when it WORKS, we absolutely steamroll teams. Risks mean sometimes it will not work, however, and you have to take the good with the bad. I personally believe Rodgers has gotten particularly unlucky this year with his tactical risks, but that will change as the team learns and grows more flexible, like last year's team.

We're on the same page though, overall. We want the team to succeed. The answer is patience, but fans don't want to hear it.",0,1415294218,null,0,1415299228,0,cluu2wz,t3_2lgw2m,t1_cluu2wz,t1_clusxor,null,1426160196,18,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,18

1. I heard they have a strong working class following which resonated with me being the son of a machinist, even though I'm now a white collar guy.
2. The Beatles
3. They're owned by an American

So back to the point of your post, yeah, Fearless is a great tune and I've loved it for many years.

I was already leaning toward Liverpool for the other 3 reasons above and that last piece made the decision for me.  Seemed like it was meant to be.

I've been to games at my hometown's college where no students go to games (because the team sucks) and you can hear the coaches and players on the field all the way from the upper deck. Dead quiet. Look at a place like Texas A&amp;M where they subsidize *half* the stadium's tickets for students to go to the game for free or very low cost. Insane atmosphere. 


Problem is the reason colleges get to sell 25k student tickets for $10 each is because they don't quite have the wage bill that a professional organization like Chelsea has. Their only overhead comes with facility upkeep, facility staff, the coaching staff, and then housing and general expenses for the players. These are college kids that are ""amateur"" athletes who aren't getting paid anything. That's another big discussion for another time and place. 


Point is they can afford to give up revenue in exchange for atmosphere when they aren't paying top players $300k a week. NFL atmospheres are generally shit because players make millions and tickets cost $160 for nosebleeds. Chelsea probably could subsidize but not to the extent that big college football programs do in the US. Chelsea are a business and the execs sure do like their money.

Also remember we got 6/9 points with Sturridge and have beat everyone's favourite Southampton. Also the players that are new to the club who have played quite a bit are Moreno,Manquillo,Lovren,Lallana,Lambert,Markovic,Balo and Can to a lesser extant so there is 5/6 new signings playing regularly not just one or two. There is no rule that we should be able to integrate 2-4 new starters quickly. Southampton are the exception not the norm. Also the players of last season are nowhere near their form including Sterling and Henderson. So it's the mix of newer players and poor form of others producing average performances, but given time to integrate they will come good.

The teams we face this season have also been playing more defensively so we can't exactly use the same style as last season especially with two of the main proponents of that missing. So Rodgers has to try to find a new way that will also be more defensively sound and that will probably take longer than we want unfortunately. So I certainly don't think we are trouble even though this season resembles the first half season under BR, with the main exception we have a better quality squad who will hopefully come good later in the season.

I don't think we should be panicking thinking the ship is sinking, you're definitely right that we have some positives to focus on and it isn't a crisis.  Our performances lately haven't had much positive play in them though, and it's hard to watch every weekend.  We were spoiled rotten last season with the football we were playing, and I think it set the expectations rather a bit too high for this season.  This is definitely a transition season for us, you don't lose a player like Suarez (and then bring in no real replacement) and not have a period of adjustment.  We've also still been nicking points here and there without Sturridge, which is good.  It's really scary to see the team play the same flat, boring, unintuitive football every weekend because it doesn't look like there's progress yet, at least on the surface of things.

Rodgers is a very good manager, and a smart manager.  He'll get it right.  I think he's been stubborn this season both tactically and with his man management (I really didn't like how he blamed Sakho and Balotelli for things at different times and he should be deflecting blame away from them in the public spectrum) and he needs to get back to the guile he had at times last season to get us clicking as a team again, but I do think it'll come eventually.  He's shown he can really train players to perform very well with the likes of Sturridge, Henderson, and Sterling, and he's shown that he can make adjustments to get things where they need to be.  He might be a little high on himself following last season but all in all I think he'll get his feet back on the ground and go back to his personal basics, which will get us rolling again.

All that said, with the way things have been going this season and it being a real threat that we might not make it into the top 4 again this time, isn't that a huge setback?  I know it was a 4 year project, but with arriving early into the Champion's League, we need to cement our spot immediately.  If we don't then we lose quite some draw for the kind of players we could really use another 1-2 of (the Sanchez/Di Maria level of player) and it might leave us making less progress going forward than we should.  How do you feel that we'd be impacted by that?

20' - Kane wins the ball high up the field directly after losing it, passes it to Lamela who shoots right at the keeper from outside the box

22' - Harry Kane offside for the 2nd or 3rd time

23' - playing it around the back, pitch seems slow

24' - Stambouli with a great run up the middle, passes to Eriksen who finds Dier but the cross isn't great and the attack fizzles out

25' - Dembele finds Dier on the right, passes to Townsend but he miscontrols and the ball goes out of bounds

26' - Dembele runs over an Asteras player about 30 yards out, free kick...

27' - ... and Vorm gets away with one as he fails to land the punch but the play ends for offsides

28' - Lamela beats a man outside the box, then skies his shot. Bad decision, should have looked for Davies out to his left.

30' - Chance for Asteras after a ricochet but the low cross/shot dribbles past the post and out. They're looking a little more dangerous now

32' - Eriksen is spending quite a bit of time as the farthest man forward, pressuring the keeper when he's on the ball

33' - bad pass from Dembele, Davies has to stretch for it and trips an Asteras player

34' - I honestly can't tell what our attacking shape is supposed to be right now

35' - throw in in our own half after an Asteras player falls over

36' - PENALTY FOR SPURS! Eriksen with a good run, ball bounces back to Townsend who runs into the box and is fouled

36' - TOWNSEND SCORES! Smashes it to the right, keeper went the right way but had no chance

37' - Asteras want a foul for a pull back by Dier outside the Spurs 18 yard box, had his arms up but would have been harsh

39' - Townsend has been playing on the left for a little while now

40' - Replay of the penalty, was a good decision - Townsend pulled the ball back intelligently right as the tackle came in so all it got was his feet

41' - Kane, Lamela, and Eriksen try to play it among themselves, eventually Kane slips as he tries to take the ball into the box.

42' - Stambouli wins it up high, eventually gets to Townsend who crosses it in and HARRY KANE SCORES!!

43' - I love wingers :')

44' - Dier passes to Kane, then back to Dier who can't complete his pass, Asteras clear and Fazio chests it out

45' - Foul by Townsend in Asteras' half, keeper clears but Fazio heads it nicely to Eriksen and the ball is free to be cycled among Spurs defence

46' - Vertonghen makes a 2012 era charge forward with the ball, ends up out with Dier on the right who crosses low across the box where Kane is offside (and it's a good thing, because he missed an absolute sitter as the whistle went). That's all for the half!

Half time - ooh, very stylish Assassins Creed Unity add, looking forward to getting it for PC soon. That's followed immediately by a terrible SpecSavers add with ""Sexy and I Know It"" and some dancing old people. Later, McDonalds is both ""upmarket"" and ""down-to-earth"" and Formula E is still trying to figure out who is supposed to be interested. Commentators on ITV worrying that we'll start the 2nd half slowly and let Asteras back in and highlighting how much more effective Andros is on the left. More commercials, favorite is an octopus playing four games of ping pong at once (not sure what it has to do with Betfair though). Also like the owl watching Orange is the New Black alone in the dark - we've all been there.

46' - Soldado on for Lamela

46' - Wow, Asteras should have pulled on back there, nice pass turns Dier inside out and Tsokanis gets in, only to miss to Vorm's right

47' - And another big chance for Asteras, Vertonghen loses the ball at the top of the box but Rolle misses badly

49' - Team's looking ragged after the restart, but eventually take it forward for Eriksen to shoot from about 25 yards out

50' - Vorm takes a chance, holding onto the ball at his feet for too long so that his kick is blocked by an Asteras player. Goes out for a goal kick, luckily

51' - Townsend with a decent shot but nothing comes of it

53' - Nice combination play between Kane and Townsend and then Eriksen and Townsend, but Asteras take the ball and break...

53' - ...and another chance for Asteras after Vertonghen is shoved off the ball but Perra(?) misses a good chance

54' - another chance for Asteras, 3 v 3 break but the shot is poor again. 

55' - Corner for Spurs after a nice Kane pass and Soldado miss. Headed behind for another corner

55' - Short corner, ball is passed back to the defense. Dier eventually sends it into the box, but it's cleared for an Asteras half break that Vertonghen deals with

57' - Soldado offside from a Vorm goal kick (bounced off a head or two on the way)

57' - Fazio heads away a decent Asteras cross, throw in for the Greek team

58' - Kane heads away an Asteras corner

59' - Townsend miscontrols a difficult pass. Commentators are discussing their favorite dinosaurs (""Stegosaurus or Triceratops?"" was the choice line).

60' - Ziggy Badibanga is on for Asteras. Chadli should come on soon as well. 

61' - Townsend with a cross to the top of the box, Kane shoots but power is taken out by a deflection and the keeper holds it. 

61' - Asteras go down the field and force Vorm into a save immediately afterwards. Poor defending means they get another chance after winning the ball from Davies but the play ends with offsides

63' - Mason on for Eriksen. Christen didn't do much, still seems to be finding it difficult to adapt to Poch's style and Lamela's positioning.

64' - Davies with a foul, smashes his forehead into the back of an Asteras player's head while going up for the ball

64' - Played forward but the header is easy for Vorm. Another cross comes in and Asteras want a penalty for a shoulder in the back from Davies. Player went down pretty easy

65' - Beautiful shot from Mazza his the post, struck the ball on the hop. Asteras are unlucky not to have scored

66' - Spurs are consistently moving the ball up the pitch but Asteras are breaking well and the defense looks stretched 

68' - Should have had a foul for a push on Kane, but eventually get the ball back anyway and Townsend runs with it. Not much to report right now, neither side can connect more than a couple of passes.

69' - Asteras throw in high up on their left, poor cross is dealt with well though. Eventually gets to Mason who passes it ahead to Kane only for it to bounce out for a Spurs throw

71' - Asteras' energy levels are down, failing to score during that 15 minute period on the front foot seems to have sapped their confidence

72' - Kane loses the ball in Asteras' box, ball is cleared all the way to Vorm and then Spurs lose it at the back...

73' - ... and the Play ends with offsides, Asteras really should have done better with that. 

74' - Decent shoot from Soldado, unfortunately ITV's stream was frozen so I missed the buildup.

75' - Game is open but without much end product or invention. Townsend gets it and runs at Asteras, then passes it out to Kane on the left who shoots into a defender. Asteras breaks but Fazio heads well despite slipping and Spurs clear to Townsend on the left, who crosses just ahead of Soldado. Good chance out of almost nothing there. 

76' - Kane won't have to play in goal tonight, he's off for Paulinho.

77' - Foul near midway by Dembele who came in a little hard from behind, Asteras's attack ends in offsides (again). The home side's set pieces have been poor throughout the game

79' - The pitch is pretty poor, a couple passes have bounced up off the ground for no apparent reason

80' - Paulinho shoots from 25 yards out, hits the first man and Asteras have a goal kick. 

81' - Davies is beat down the left by Badibanga but recovers well to force a poor cross

83' - Asteras attack and draw a free kick from Stambouli (although Mason gets a yellow for his role) 30 yards out from goal to Vorm's right

84' - Ball bounces around in the box after the set piece, Fazio (I think) blocks one shot and Vorm makes a great reflex save on the second.

86' - Soldado hasn't been involved much, makes a halfhearted attempt to charge down the Asteras keeper but he's able to pick the ball up

87' - Badibanga gets the ball on the right, Davies blocks the first cross and Badibanga's second is right into Vorm's arms

88' - close call, Asteras puts the ball into the box and Badibanga flicks it from behind his body towards goal. Vorm gets down in time to block though

89' - RED CARD FOR FAZIO. Geronimo(?) Barrales gets behind the defense and Fazio runs into him from behind with an arm on his back. Harsh, but understandable call. Penalty to Asteras...

90' - GOAL FOR ASTERAS. Barrales smashes it down the middle, Vorm dives to his right and almost stops the ball with his legs but it goes through

92' - Series of headers in the Spurs box, nice header from Badibanga is just wide. Vorm was worried there, and Asteras are attacking well.

93' - Soldado almost gets behind, then Paulinho sends the Asteras keeper's clearance out of play. Ball is knocked up by Asteras and Vorm gets a goal kick.

94' - Soldado chases the ball down, should just go to the corner but he's clearly desperate for a goal and shoots. Luckily wins a corner kick.

94' - THATS ALL, SPURS WIN 2-1",0,1415298126,null,0,1415303494,1,cluwehh,t3_2lhti0,t1_cluwehh,t3_2lhti0,null,1426159112,79,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,79

Wrong. 


Who are you to decide who is or is not progressive?

Some of British socialism's most celebrated names were among the champions of eugenics - Sidney and Beatrice Webb (the founders of the Fabian Society), Harold Laski, John Maynard Keynes, even the New Statesman and the Manchester Guardian. 

illiam Beveridge, the architect of the post-1945 welfare state, was highly active in the eugenics movement and said that ""those men who through general defects are unable to fill such a whole place in industry are to be recognized as unemployable. They must become the acknowledged dependents of the State... but with complete and permanent loss of all citizen rights - including not only the franchise but civil freedom and fatherhood

upporters of eugenics in Parliament included the Labour MP Will Crooks who described disabled people as ""like human vermin"" who ""crawl about doing absolutely nothing, except polluting and corrupting everything they touch"". A bill for the compulsory sterilisation of certain categories of ""mental patient"" was proposed in Parliament in 1931 by Labour MP Archibald Church. He claimed it was necessary to stop the reproduction of those ""who are in every way a burden to their parents, a misery to themselves and in my opinion a menace to the social life of the community

And some of it seems a little ideological most comedians seem to have views solidly within the spectrum of sort of 'establishment left/liberal' culture that the Guardian is representative of  partly and an element of UKIP's schtick is to  sort of 'set themselves against' that (or at least the cultural elements of it), so it's hardly surprising.  I think there might  also be a bit of a class and geographical element aswell with UKIP supporters being disproportionately 'lower middle class' and reflecting the culture of 'unfashionable' areas etc. 

I think they are obviously wrong about it being anything like a conspiracy either but I don't think it has to be for people to be against in a way that looks co-ordinated, this famous interview between [Andrew Marr and Noam Chomsky](http://youtu.be/GjENnyQupow?t=4m16s) gives a good example how most media slection processes work imo, with the added bit that audiences and critics obviously have a big say in what type of comedy is permitted in which areas etc.

Yes. A doctor should be asked to carry out procedures contrary to their religious or political beliefs if it is required. They should not be required to promote positions that are against their religious or political beliefs.

Danny died. And more than that it was random, pedestrian -- a very 'real life' death. Clara described it as ""boring"", ""ordinary"" and ""like stepping off a bus"". In a world where you normally get to heroically fight back, and people seem to be protected by invulnerable [plot armor](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotArmor), it felt fresh. Will he stay dead?

Was the lava scene effective? It demonstrated Clara's love and desperation clearly and quickly, and it gave us that great line ""Do you think I care for you so little that betraying me would make a difference?"", but were you too distracted thinking of ways they could get back into the TARDIS anyway?

Was the 3W theory about the afterlife appropriate for children? It didn't occur to me at the time that this might cause controversy, but there has been a bit.

Sex change. Ever since *The Doctor's Wife* we knew it was possible for a Time Lord to become a Time Lady. Was it a good development for the Master's character? (It looks to me like it might be.) What does this mean for the Doctor maybe becoming a woman? (I think it might have been intended as a compromise, and to undercut some of the motivation for it.)

**How does this episode tie in to what happened before?**

We've seen robots and cyborgs this series searching for the promised land. How did they hear about it? What will happen to them when they get there? (Will they merely become Cybermen?) Where the events in *Mummy on the Orient Express* related to Missy's plans?

What motivates the Cybermen in *Dark Water*? Are they just trying to multiply their units or do they think this works toward a more central goal? The Mondassian Cybermen, for example, were carrying out a misguided and inflexible plan to preserve the Mondassian's lives. Could something like that explain why these Cybermen accept the dead now that 3W says there's life after death?

**What theories do we believe about this episode?**

Is the 3W ""discovery"" that the dead continue to experience what happens to their bodies the truth or a cruel lie meant to set in motion some kind of evil plot? Could it be a lie, yet also a misguided attempt to do good?

Missy was toying with the Doctor a bit. She even pretended to be a robot just for fun. Was the line ""The one you abandoned, Doctor. The one you left for dead. Didn't you ever think I'd find my way back?"" one of the lies? Do we believe she's really the Master?

You're right that it's a big blow if we miss out this year, but with the collapse of Man U (or rather, coming down to earth) and the nature of the projected top 7 teams right now, I don't see a clear 1-4 for the next 5 years. 

This is all strange because we're so used to long standing managers and teams playing systems that have been in place forever. Rodgers is currently the 5th most tenured PL manager, which is pretty insane when you think about it. 

I think we're entering a new era of chaos here in the PL where top for is truly up for grabs every year. Just look at all the predictions of last year's table and you'll see the pundits (and the fans) don't know shit about what's going to happen. Teams are spending wild amounts of money, managers are being beheaded left and right. The only constant is that Arsenal will have a lot of injuries and come 4th.

What I'm saying is that even if we miss out this year, this coming half decade is going to be a free for all in the PL and we are in prime position to come out of that chaos as a superpower thanks to the choices we made THIS year. Obviously this sounds like horseshit until we start winning, but I really think it's the long view (looking at the next 2-3 seasons, not just this one) that will propel this club and its supporters to our proper place among Europe's elite.

Rodgers did it with someone else's players when he came in, why won't it happen even faster with players he has handpicked for his system? (save for, again, Balotelli) In my opinion, these players are *already* learning faster than the 2012 bunch - many of whom remain, but Rodgers requires everyone working the system for it to work. That takes time, and until then we will be starved for chance creation and it will be hard for supporters.

I have a lot of faith. I realize it may be above average for a Liverpool supporter at the moment, but I just wish more people would take the long view here and see that we're BUILDING something that will win consistently.

Put it this way: Would you trade 6th place this year to win the league in 2017, and usher in an era of dominance? I know it's hard because we're currently experiencing this shit run, but I would take that deal.

Spurs aspire to be a champions league club and right now, Kane is not an elite striker. He may become one, but he is not one yet.

Chelsea have Costa
City have Aguero
Man Utd have Falcao, Van Persie and Rooney

Even Liverpool have Balotelli (ignore his start for them - his career stats are 1 in 2).

The only other clubs that have comparable level of strikers are Everton with Lukaku and Naismith, and Arsenal with Welbeck and Giroud (but they have Elite ballers in midfield with Sanchez and Ozil).

This is what we think we're fighting against so the idea of cheering for a prospect instead of having the real deal makes the average Spurs fan pine for something better, proven and elite.

The reasons for becoming involved in the war varied by country and a great many of them, and their elites, did not really want to become involved in a conflict. Britain, for example, found itself caught between a rock and a hard place in its obligations to its allies, the need to preserve what we would call now a balance of power, amongst other things.

How can you say that none of the dead had any quarrel and that every single country fought because of an obsession with empire? Why did people volunteer then? How come there were numerous quarrels and grievances that people wished to settle? You don't have to like the system that allowed the war to happen to think the situation is more complicated than ""evil capitalists playing us all like puppets"".

What about Belgium, for example? Belgium had been invaded by the largest land military power in Europe, and mostly occupied. German forces were hardly innocent bystanders while their political leadership were evil; they carried out a number of significant war crimes in Belgium (which ironically people forget because British propaganda exaggerated them). Was the war just fought for Belgium's empire in Africa then? No, of course it wasn't. 

&gt; And it only ended when the Germans went out on general strike. 

A strike that was forced by Allied military strategy making wartime life increasingly unbearable for the German population. On top of that, the idea that it was a military stalemate and that it took internal political pressure entirely for Germany to lose is just nonsense that is similar to the stabbed in the back myth. Germany was on the road to a massive strategic defeat by November 1918.

EDIT - A better and briefer way of putting that last point would be; the strike didn't happen in a vacuum.

This is the issue though, Labour is a well established party with a large number of members and without such a constant history of racist/homophobic material. Meanwhile UKIP is a much newer, smaller party which has *constantly* come up against these issues - whether it's their councillors making comments about gay floods, or their MEPs making racist comments. You say things like ""UKIP has disassociated itself"", but you have people like Godfrey Bloom making statements like 


&gt;""no self-respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of child-bearing age.""

He made that statement in 2004, he left the party in 2014 for unrelated reasons.

You have Janice Atkinson who described a Thai woman as a

&gt;""ting tong from somewhere""


She's an MEP for them *and after that remark* she's going to be their candidate for MP for Folkstone. 

Nigel Farage himself isn't entirely clean either, with his euphemistic remarks about Romanians, and the accusations by the founder of UKIP that he uses terms such as ""Nig-nog"" in friendly company. This is a party which only has about 3 names anyone recognises, so when you hear these things, it's not just a minority of the party, it's part of a small party. Someone from Labour could come forward and say something racist, but it'd 1 MP out of hundreds or 1 councillor out of thousands, 1 member out of tens of thousands. Not 1 MEP out of a dozen or 1 UKIP party official out of the 3 we can remember the name of. 


But let's be clear, it's not only these remarks. It's the fact that this aligns with their policies. They are by far the most anti-immigration party in terms, they are where racist people will go for the policies they want. If you think there are racists in the Labour party, I'm sure there are, but they've been in government and you can look at their policies and you'd see it'd be nuts to call them a racist party- that brings with it a level of established trust that UKIP simply can't have, because in the only parliament they have any power they've made a group with far right extremists. 


So you see, it's not the comments from people, it's not the policies, it's not the leadership, it's not the political allies, it's not the representatives they have, it's not their members. It's *all of it*. ",0,1415302963,null,0,false,0,cluzafi,t3_2lgp9p,t1_cluzafi,t1_cluy4xj,null,1426157715,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I've lived in the Middle East and restaurants have to have two separate kitchens if they serve pork products. Someone with special needs that I couldn't easily accommodate, eg if I had to adapt my home for wheelchair use and this wasn't possible.

My thought with Naismith was sticking him in behind the two strikers and putting Ross in the deeper central midfield role with freedom to roam and make an impact further up the pitch (Think Man United with Di Maria playing as a CM and Mata at CAM). Ross would be pretty much free of defensive responsibility due to an Anchor Man's presence behind him and his CM partner beside him as opposed to only having one central player supporting him. Honestly think that unless our wingers start doing amazingly well we should adopt something like this as a plan B, use it for a few matches to keep things fresh. 
Thinking not only for playing both forwards but also for an overall tactic, if we wanted to slot Mirallas in there we could play him as one of the two front men, but with Kev dropping deeper and drifting a bit wider while his strike partner can stay situated centrally at the opponent's back line as a traditional striker would. Lukaku would fit great for this with his physical presence, he could spearhead the attack down the middle. Imagine Lukaku being fed by a roaming Barkley and Mirallas as well as Naismith in his natural position and Baines/Coleman free to cross the ball into the area!

I do still think our 4-2-3-1 is the best option with our players but it can't hurt to have a plan B, especially with injuries!

It is just a shame that our view of WW1 as a nation has become a bit too attached to a very one track minded view of it.

The funny thing is that Michael Gove controversy with WW1 - where he got rebuked for saying that the left wing had allowed education to not be ""patriotic enough"" about it, I don't know if you remember it, but what amused me about that whole thing was that the actual criticisms he made, some of them, were very valid, from a historical perspective. I mean in terms of stuff like the lions led by donkeys myth and all that (the idea that all the generals were morons and all the soldiers brave victims) he made a point that most historians of the period would probably support I think.

*However*, the problem is with what he said is that it was politically motivated rather than trying to improve our understanding of the war. He just wanted the Tories to look more patriotic than Labour and to suit his archaic principles on education, when actually at least in the subject of history most teachers seem to want away from the national curriculum whoever the party in government is.

My fear is that 6th this season will see us stripped of the resources and appeal that we need to attract the final few pieces and propel us there.  I really think we have exceptionally talented young players who work incredibly hard and I can see why you have a lot of faith for the future, I share a lot of it too.  But I think we're missing 1-3 (depending on who leaves/retires in the next couple of seasons) really top quality players to drive us on to the next level.  I think we need these in addition to the development of our core of young players too.

The league looks scary for us, and I think it's because of exactly what you said: it's chaotic.  It's so hard to gauge how we stack up to the other top sides and predict any kind of order at this point.  That makes us in bad form especially nerve wracking because there's no telling if we'll rebound well enough and/or someone else will fall hard enough for us to leap over them.  It's actually really exciting overall, but when you're really emotionally invested in a team that's having some serious ups and downs as we are, it's also very stressful.

I'm not sure I'd call United a collapse yet, they were able to bring in some amazing players this summer in spite of their bad previous season and will probably be able to do so for at least another season if they fail to make the top 4 again.  They're not going to fall like we did because they still have amazing wealth to draw upon at the club (as opposed to us, we were days away from administration).  They can rebuild faster and more immediate effect because of this.

You keep mentioning that you think our players are learning really fast, but the thing that really makes me so nervous is that we aren't showing many signs of it at all.  Our performances have been really similar this season, they've all been dull, flat, and uninventive going forward coupled with crippling defensive errors.  We've made less defensive errors the past 3 games though, which is encouraging (plus Rodgers changed the shape of our back line when in possession which I think is making a huge difference in thwarting fast transitions), but we almost look worse attacking each game.  Rodgers is also really hesitant to start looking for life after Gerrard and prepare himself pre-emptively, which is a little scary.  Stevie is an essential figure at Liverpool and I'm not advocating dropping him forever or relegate him to a primarily super sub-esque role, but I don't like how he's playing 180 minutes in 4 days, or 270 minutes in 7 days, this season.

That's the problem, they're *classic* Who villains. The Daleks you can get away with because they're the Doctor's true nemesis and it's been that way since the beginning. Also, they've done very well to expand the Dalek story and change the way it's told. The Cybermen are very one dimensional, and are the same every time their story is told. There's no room for expanding their story really. Or maybe there is, but they haven't.

I posted this in r/Bitcoin yesterday, but thought it could be relevant here.

One thing I've observed coming back a lot in the subreddits are people looking for UK BTC companies as well as a number of reoccurring trust issues. Most notably, it's often difficult to know who is behind a BTC business and what makes that one similar from another one. It's also often not very clear who is actually operating currently in the market and where the best places to send your BTC are.

Here's an example I made with Mintpal. It took me about half a day to gather all the info and format it nicely. Would you find it useful to have something similar for other UK BTC businesses focused on the movements involving the legal entities behind them as well as any market information from dissatisfied users?

Your feedback is appreciated =)

false,[deleted],null,null,"Don't rely too much on the previous tenants - they might be weird. The tenants before us in our last flat were using more than twice the amount of electricity we were, somehow. Unfortunately, because you pay your landlord for bills, you're not automatically entitled to switch though you may be able to persuade a nice landlord to switch anyway (if the arrangement was in your name, you would be allowed to switch even as a renter). It's not the building owner, it's the individual bill-payer for each flat who controls the supplier - in your case, the landlord.

That said, I am really, really suspicious of this arrangement where the landlord tells you how much it costs. I find it really strange. There are usually three ways of dealing with energy costs when renting:

1. You find a supplier and pay the supplier

2. The landlord finds a supplier and you pay the landlord a set amount for bills each month. They might give you the leftovers at the end of the year, or might not.

3. Pre-payment meters (avoid where possible!)

If you think the landlord is trustworthy, then I suppose this is a variation on option 2, where instead of saying ""£40 each month will cover it"", they're basically saying ""it was £37.65 this month and £46.52 last month"".

I assume you watch the news? You've seen the deadly prejudice of catholics against protestants and vice versa in Northern Ireland. The current prejudice against middle eastern christians that sees them being killed because they CHOOSE to worship as christians and NOT as muslims.  

The persecution of  travelers around the whole of europe. Then there has been the historical persecution of people with alternative political opinions like communists in Nazi germany and non-communists in the Soviet Unions **BUT ACCORDING TO /U/Slaird ALL THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE THEY HAD THE SAME ETHNICITY AND BIRTH PLACE**. Give over. You know all this, you're taught this at school. You're just being deliberately ignorant to make a point. 

You've deliberately misrepresented my point about ""prejudice as a way of thinking"" that dismisses a whole group based on the actions of a few bad apples.  **Beliefs are different than genetic characteristics BUT the thinking that allows you dismiss a whole group based on the actions of the few IS the same.**

If you've ever heard anyone from the BNP speak about *when* they turned racist against a race the chances are they will talk about negative experiences with people of that race. They've taken one or two bad examples and aggregated it to the whole population. This ,in my, experience is how prejudice forms in the real world. One or two bad examples = whole community. It happens to ALL sorts of communities - It can be anything from skin colour, to trivial choice of music, to area of your town, to accent. NOW I am NOT saying they are all equal in consequence, effect, pervasiveness or seriousness. What I am saying is that they come from the same root idea. One or two bad examples = allows you to dismiss a whole community as basically bad. I don't think anyone who claims to be against prejudice should be spreading this as a legitimate way to think about people. Why is that so wrong?

This sounds good. If I have to cut foods out of my diet then I will and see how it works, so this I will give a go!

Yeah, my skin is very sensitive because of SD, so I do need to be careful not to use anything that will irritate it. That cream sounds really good! I'll have a look around and see if I can get some and give it a try. I never thought about asking for samples, so that's a great idea, thank you for that.

&gt;Not all early supporters of eugenics in Sweden subscribed to the radical ideas that we associate with these scientists, but the fact that some of its most influential promoters did—not least the director of the race-biological institute—would in effect make Swedish eugenics in the 1920s an important contributor to the right-wing flank of ‘mainline’ or ‘orthodox’ eugenics that would eventually become a pillar of Third Reich biopolitics.

The same association that was involved with drafting the laws that came into effect in 1934.

And now the left wing are trying to revoke aspects of the law, [guess who's standing in their way - Conservatives!](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/01/17/sweden-keeps-sterilisation-rule-for-trans-recognition/)  Quelle surprise...

&gt;The Swedish Government have announced that they will not modernise a law from the 1970s which makes sterilisation compulsory for transgender people before the state will recognise their gender identity. 

&gt;The majority of the Swedish Parliament are reportedly in favour of the change, but the process has been blocked by a small conservative party.

So yeah, some supporters of early eugenics weren't right-wing racist scumbags, but a lot of the influential ones were.  Being a champion of eugenics in this day and age definitely marks you out as a bit of a twat, and I can't imagine anyone even in the centre-left of politics in this country admitting to it.

As for progressivism:

&gt;Immanuel Kant identified progress as being a **movement away from barbarism towards civilization.** Eighteenth century philosopher and political scientist Marquis de Condorcet pre­dicted that political progress would involve the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of in­equalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty.[5] ""Modernity"" or ""modernization"" was a key form of the idea of progress as promoted by classical liberals in the 19th and 20th centuries, who called for the rapid modernization of the economy and society to remove the traditional hindrances to free markets and free movements of people

Mutilating people because you don't like the cut of their jib is in no way a step away from barbarity, or a step towards equality.  Sterilization has got fuck all to do with being progressive; as far as civilization goes it's totally regressive. 

As for a Labour MP calling disabled people vermin - do you really think he's a leftie, just because he's in the Labour party?

They were more concious about the energy they used, but not limited by it, and instead would plan a bit ahead more. So rather than getting up and turning kettle, tv, lights, toaster, shower and washing machine on, they would have the washing run overnight on a timer, put the kettle on, then the toaster, then the tv. Essentially the impact was that they were having to wait 60 seconds more for some things they would have otherwise done at once and expected the diesel generator to pick up. 

I think part of the issue is 99% of people have no real idea of how much energy they actually use/need. I certainly don't. So as soon as you mention a cap people start panicking because they don't really know what impact it'll have.

[Here is a BBC article about the labour party trying to counter UKIP, lots of big name labourites making noises about slowing East European immigration](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27630459). The higher up the polls that UKIP goes, the louder those noises will become.

Immigration is seen as a problem, from Eastern Europe especially.

It's not a new problem, either. Labour talked tough about immigration during their terms in power {back in [2004 Labour Immigration Minister Beverley Hughes had to resign after admitting she ""unwittingly"" misled people about a suspected visa scam](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3589131.stm)}. In other words, Labour talk tough but achieve very little.

Another problem is the EU. 

People see ""the EU is meddling in our affairs and costing us £££"" bollocks that appear daily in the papers and that causes them to worry. Cameron and his ""I'll try to change how the EU works"" nonsense will achieve very little, just like Labour.

So the two problems remain. The immigration problem cannot be solved due to the freedom of movement rights granted by the EU.

Cameron wants to stay in the EU, as do Labour. So if someone is worried about immigration and/or the EU, who should they vote for? Which party will do something about their problems?

I don't think Reus will come to Chelsea, I think he'll end up at Bayern because that seems like the obvious destination for him but this is a poor reason. Chelsea have a world class side right now. Some of the names are bigger elsewhere but to argue Reus would be taking a step down is stretching it. I think most people would rate Hazard over him and on recent form Fabregas and Costa are both among the best in the world in their respective positions. Further back where they usually gets less press there are also some world class players (Matic is one of the best DMs in the world, Courtois one of the best keepers, Luis, Azpilicueta and Ivanovic all fantastic). He's not much better than a lot of the team and I don't think he would be the best player either.

Besides, sometimes players want to be the standout player in a side. Since the team Reus seems to have wanted to play for are Barca and they can't sign him, maybe he wants to go somewhere where he can still be a standout talent like Di Maria did instead of being another cog in the machine at Bayern (even with his talent shining over Robben and Ribery, even as they're getting older, would be kind of hard).",0,1415308374,null,0,false,0,clv2l4k,t3_2li4u8,t1_clv2l4k,t1_clv119p,null,1426156177,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

I totally get why people like him, his ability to use his body to shield the ball and to go past people is amazing.

However for me he lacks a good pass, and his shooting ability seems to have deserted him. He neither scores goals nor does he assist many.

I like having him there ""recycling"" the ball bringing it forward, but without that eye for the pass or a killer shot I feel his place on the field is better filled by others. While Mason/Bentaleb are not ""better than"" Dembele right now, I think they offer more going forward and wouldn't like to see their playing time restricted by playing Moussa ahead of them.

Add to that his chronic injury problems and age (27 isn't that old, but with the injury history I think it's going to catch up to him), and I think now is the perfect time to move him on as his value is only going to decrease.

Transfermarkt have him currently valued at 17mill, and to be honest if someone offered us 15 for Dembele at the end of this season I would take that money and run.

Again I'm not saying he's a bad player, I just think the best thing for the club would be to cash in on him sooner rather than later.",0,1415309338,null,0,false,0,clv369p,t3_2li2eg,t1_clv369p,t3_2li2eg,null,1426155903,10,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,10

All these people whose ancestors devoted themselves, sacrificed themselves to you. Can you hear them singing? Oh you like to think you're a god. But you're not a god. You're just a parasite. Eat now with jealousy and envy and longing for the lives of others. You feed on them. On the memory of love and loss and birth and death and joy and sorrow, so... so come on then. Take mine. Take my memories. But I hope you're got a big a big appetite. Because I've lived a long life. And I've seen a few things. I walked away from the last great Time War. I marked the passing of the Time Lords. I saw the birth of the universe and watched as time ran out, moment by moment, until nothing remained. No time, no space. Just me! I walked in universes where the laws of physics were devised by the mind of a madman! And I watched universes freeze and creation burn! I have seen things you wouldn't believe! I have lost things you will never understand! And I know things, secrets that must never be told, knowledge that must never be spoken! Knowledge that will make parasite gods blaze! So come on then! Take it! Take it all, baby! Have it! You have it all!

&gt; Clara: Still hungry? Well I brought something for you. This. The most important leaf in human history. The most important leaf in human history. It's full of stories. Full of history. And full of a future that never got lived. Days that should have been and never were. Passed on to me. This leaf isn't just the past, it's a whole future that never happened. There are billions and millions of unlived days for every day we live—an infinity. All the days that never came. And these are all my mum's.

&gt;The Doctor: Well? Come on then. Eat up. Are you full? I expect so. Because there's quite a difference isn't there? Between what was and what should have been. There's an awful lot of one but there's an infinity of the other. And infinity is too much. Even for your appetite.

Look at me! No plan, no back-up, no weapons worth a damn, oh, and something else. I don't have anything to lose. So if you're sitting up there in your silly little spaceship with all your silly little guns and you've got any plans on taking the Pandorica tonight, just remember who's standing in your way!

and my original reason for posting was that you were lumping all UKIP people in with the loonies, and then blaming them all for the words and actions of a very small minority. In other words, you are calling people who chose to vote UKIP racist (whether that is your intention or not that is what it comes across as, because you are lumping the good in with the bad).

As I showed with my last post, people have seen a problem with immigration and they have seen a problem with the EU. Anti-UKIP people rarely give any solutions to those people who have those problems, they just shout at them that they are wrong/stupid/racist/fascist.

I would in any event be extremely surprised if free banking in general were ever to disappear, as at present current accounts run as a loss leader.

You're going to want to start out ahead of the pack in terms of certifications, so get yourself onto a Comptia A+ and Comptia Network+ program as soon as you can.

You can get both exams for about £70 a shot if you're willing to shop around a bit, and if you're not willing to pay for a course you can find the books/courseware on your friendly local torrent site. Neither exam is particularly hard if you know the basics, but a lot of entry-level techs simply don't have them ready for a first placement. The A+ is great as it also teaches communication and professionalism which a lot of techies don't have (Trust me, I've worked with them).

Unless of course he begins to score goals, then I think Chadli still has that spot locked in. 

Fazio is starting to worry me a little due to his highly physical game. 2 reds in his last 2 starts is something to be concerned about, although I do think he and Verts can become a solid partnership in the back. Let's just hope he works on his discipline and can learn to play smarter. 

Dier and Davies are far too slow to provide good attacks on the flanks but it was nice to see Townsend get into the space left in the wide areas. Granted Dier is a CB being played out of position but Davies is a natural left back. I just feel that Davies lacks the pace and the high football IQ required to play as a full back. 

Soldado continues to look great on the ball and during the build up but fuck me the guy can't score to save his newborn baby's life. The more I read about how we're targeting Rodriguez, the more I entertain the idea of him in a Spurs shirt.

false,SmileAndNod64,mcgann,McGann,"Nononono   the cyber men are the most fascinating villain in dw. New who?   They've been just a generic villain, but go watch the classic who episodes and listen to spare parts (audio drama) 

There's a reason the cybermen are used so much.   The cybermen are the opposite of the doctor,  while the daleks serve as a parallel.  I'll expand on this when I get home. 

Edit:  Okay, let's look at this.  I'll start by comparing the genesis of the Daleks to that of the cybermen as shown in Spare Parts.

**Daleks** - In Genesis of the Daleks we see the Thals and the Kaleds at war.  The lead scientist of the Kaleds is Davros, who, in a move of desperation artificially alters the DNA of his people to remove all emotions except hate and create an unstoppable army that will defeat all enemy races.  A key point to note is that the Daleks believe they are the perfect beings and superior to all other races.  They were born out of war.

**Cybermen** - In *Spare Parts* we see the Mondasians trying to survive their planet being torn out of orbit.  Due to the dropping temperature the entire planet is forced to move underground.  The population begins to decline.  In order to prolong the life of the species, Doctorman Allan (the lead scientist of the Mondasians) develops augmentations to allow for survival.  Initially these are small things like replacement hearts and limbs.  Meanwhile there was a plan to attach a rocket to the planet and steer it back to orbit.  The only way people could survive working on this rocket was to completely convert.  This was then forced on the rest of the planet.  They were born out of a need to survive.

This is the key distinction between the two.  The Daleks were created to win a war, the Cybermen were created to survive.

So let's compare this to the Doctor.  I'm going to make a definition here that people may disagree with.  I'm going to define both Love and Hate as a strong emotional connection.  If this holds true, then the opposite of love isn't hate, it's the absence of a strong emotional connection.

There has been several comparisons between the Doctor and the Daleks.  The two most notable are in *Dalek* where a Dalek remarks to the Doctor, ""You would be a good Dalek"" and in *Into the Dalek* where a Dalek says the same thing (although with more of an emphasis on the word, ""good"")

We can see more parallels if we compare the Doctor's [conversation with Davros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2dtZIUgtyA) in Genesis of the Daleks with the Doctor's actions during the Last Great Time War.  The Doctor asks if Davros created a virus that destroyed all other forms of life in the universe, would he use it.  Davros says he would.  In order to end the Time War, the Doctor is given a button that  will cause the elimination of 2 species.  He decides to use it.  (Handwashing plots aside)

But what about the Cybermen?  As I said earlier, the most important (and only) purpose of the cybermen is survival.  Almost every episode of the Cybermen throughout Classic Who has the line, ""The cybermen?  I thought they were dead.""  (See: The Moonbase, the Invasion, Tomb of the Cybermen)  The Doctor willingly destroyed his whole species, while the Cybermen will do whatever is necessary to insure the continuation of their species.  

Let's talk about humanity.  If we assume that both the Kaleds and the Mondasians are humans (In the *10th Planet* the Mondasians are called humans, and in *The Parting of the Ways* the Emperor of the Daleks is able to create Daleks from Humans, meaning they are similar enough.  Both races used Earthlings.  The Daleks were disgusted by the human parts and later purged them.  The cybermen accepted humanity as part of themselves.  Purity is irrelevant.  All that matters is survival.  The Doctor on the other hand has distanced himself from humanity throughout his lifetime.  Although he is a champion for humanity, he does not consider himself part of it.  (Shown as recently as Kill the Moon)

**Notable exceptions**  

It's important to note that due to the nature of the writing in DW, there is a lot of contradictory evidence.  Different writers have different views.

-In *Asylum of the Daleks* Daleks are shown to be willing to convert humans into Daleks.  This would be counter to the Dalek philosophy that everything not human is an abomination.  Secretly converting humans is something that Cybermen have been shown to be willing to do,  (as seen in the audio drama *Cyberman*, and *The Invasion*)  This is because the Cybermen do not have pride.

-In *The Doctor Who Movie* it is revealed the Doctor is half human.  Take that as you will.

-In *Human Nature* the Doctor becomes Human.  It's not shown, but I would bet the Doctor felt a bit of revulsion at the idea.   That's just pure speculation though.

-Almost all of New Who Cybermen.  

-The Daleks are shown several times to work with other races (See: *The Pandorica Opens*)  These instances don't make any sense.  The Daleks hate all other life.

**Final thoughts**

I kinda lost steam.  This would need a couple of revisions to be a good argument, but this gets my point across.  If you're wondering why I'm such a big fan of the Cybermen, about 2 years ago I was working on an in-universe history of the Cybermen.  To me the Cybermen represent depression.  The idea that something is always lurking behind the scenes and is impossible to defeat is terrifying.  Then there is the fact that the cybermen were created by willingly giving up everything that makes you human.  Any person has within him or her the capacity to reach a breaking point where the only option is to give up.  With hate there is a chance of redemption.  The Doctor is afraid to admit it, but he has a hope in the back of his head to save the Daleks.  (See: *Dark Eyes*, *Dalek*, *Into the Dalek*)  There is no such hope for the Cybermen (See *Human Resources pt 2*)

So yeah, apathy is the opposite of love.  

edit2:  Another point I'd like to make in the reasons why I like the Cybermen.  The Cybermen are humanities villain in the same way that The Doctor is humanities champion.  Everytime the Daleks do something, you can expect the Doctor to save the day, but the Cybermen are actually humanities problem.  If you don't think the Cybermen can be scary, try listening to Big Finish's audio series *Cyberman*  It removes the Doctor safety net from the equation.  Listening to it you don't know how its going to end.

I thought of it more not as a left/right thing but the fact that panel show comedians are generally not that funny or insightful.

false,pmastersavs,eng-Cambridgeshire,South Cambridgeshire,"""You choose a member, indeed; but when you have chosen him, he is not member of Bristol, but he is a member of Parliament"". (Burke, 1774)

Essentially, once an MP is voted in, under this model they are to act entirely in the national interest, even if it is at the expense of their own constituents. This is due to the supposed asymmetry in quality of political opinions between the elected representative and their constituents. Now this I can understand - obviously, being a political insider (i.e. an MP) endows one with knowledge of the political machine and arguments being floated on both sides that the average constituent may not possess. It is important to note that Caroline Lucas has said before that she believes entirely in this model. So, once receiving a mandate from those who voted for her, she is perfectly happy to act directly contrary to her own constituents' interests as a result of her believing she ought to only exercise her own conscience when it comes to decision making.

The opposite to this is (also Burke's) model of delegation, where elected representatives act entirely in accordance with the mandate they were elected with or their constituents' interests otherwise reported. Again, this model is silly too - I'm firmly of the conviction that MPs' decision making should reflect both their constituents' interests, as well as factoring in their own expertise that they have by virtue of the position they hold. 

I'll end this with a slightly amusing piece of history - Edmund Burke was elected, and almost immediately outlined his 'trustee model' ideas in Parliament, which went against the (at the time) general Westminster consensus of a delegate model of representation. Burke wasn't returned next election. ",0,1415315505,null,0,false,0,clv6ohx,t3_2lh0va,t1_clv6ohx,t1_cluzh5r,null,1426154197,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

If Labour swing further left the best result they can hope for is a shoring up of their grass roots and stopping some leakage to greens, this will not translate into enough seats for them to win the election, at the same time they will likely lose a chunk of the center to the Tories in the crucial swing seats.

To win they need to convince the people who might otherwise vote Tory that they they have a viable plan for growth and spending that will sort out the economy in a way that does not punish the poorest.  

Re policies - freezing energy prices: interventionist, anti free market, will hit their stock prices, they will likely rise prices massively before policy passes and blame Ed for it.

Mansion tax and top rate tax: make U.K less attractive for world class talent and very rich, could see top talent leaving as a result. 

NHS and bedroom tax: Both cost more money.

The reasons I think Diane Abbott would do well:

She speaks confidently and has a charisma that the public would relate to. The public are crying out for someone who is themselves and not a rich, white, male who is micro managed to fit what a spin doctor thinks we want. Boris and Farage are examples who have success with this ""not a typical politician"" image. Being, black, female and from a working class background she would be a perfect figure head for Labour ideals of equality and aspiration for all.   

She wouldn't pander to the anti-immigration brigade and would likely be bold enough to call them out on their bullshit without tiptoeing around it.  She has a narrative that is genuine in this area and could argue it better than Ed ever will. She is reasonably liberal and known as a bit of Maverick.

To give an idea of our aspirations: we hope to get a deposit on a house (1-2 years maximum), then one of us fall back to salaried work and the other become a stay at home once a good deposit has been saved and money isn't too much of an issue.

Retirement, savings, maternity/paternity, annual leave: agreed, they are all things we will need to look at carefully and plan for.  We definitely plan to only do contracting for 1-2 years as we know it will be an incredibly stressful time for us.  After that money won't matter and we would rather focus on living rather than working, meaning a focus on stability and salaried work rather than always chasing cash.

The instability of contracting has been discouraging me for years, but with such a large jump in income because of these opportunities it makes it worthwhile even if contracting lasts a few months.

Again, thank you all.

false,AnxiousMo-Fo,,"Labour (if you are too, check out /r/LabourUK!)","Key points:

&gt;Britain is uniquely successful, even more than Germany, in attracting the most highly skilled and highly educated migrants in Europe.

Britain's immigration policy is highly successful.

&gt;The educational levels of east Europeans who come to Britain are also improving with 25% of recent arrivals having completed a degree compared with 24% of the UK-born workforce.

And it's getting more successful.

&gt;Those from the 15 countries which made up the EU before 2004, including France, Germany, Italy and Spain, contributed 64% – £15bn more in taxes than they received in welfare – while east European migrants contributed 12%, equivalent to £5bn more.

Nonetheless, the poorer Eastern European countries don't contribute quite as much (this is unsurprising - also see above).

&gt;the UK would have had to spend £6.8bn on education to build up the same level of ""human capital""

&gt;not only are European migrants more highly educated than the UK-born workforce but they are less likely to be in receipt of state benefits

I think the latter point was already quite widely known but it's nice to have it reinforced.

&gt;“People who migrate tend to be young, better educated and energetic. They make good employees here but they are a loss to their own country. If other European countries fail to prosper because their brightest and best have travelled to the UK, we are all worse off,” 

This is an interesting point. I have to wonder what kind of prospects were really available for them in their home countries to make them want to come to Britain, though, and whether it's really justifiable to insist they stay in their home country so that our graduates can have all the nice jobs.

&gt;""In the past, the majority of growth in employment was taken up by foreign nationals; in the last year, three-quarters of it was accounted for by UK nationals.""

This is interesting in light of the arguments that Bulgarian and Romanian immigration would cause problems here in the UK. It casts some doubt on arguments that the previous tranche of immigration is really to blame, and it also will help those who argue that (with the right policies) we can have freedom of movement in the EU without increasing indigenous unemployment in the UK.",0,1415316592,null,0,false,0,clv795v,t3_2liwf6,t1_clv795v,t3_2liwf6,null,1426153929,1,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,1

false,guilty_of_innocence,null,null,"Yeah I would broadly agree that discrimination against peoples belief is different from discrimination against people due to race.  You can after all hide your beliefs if necessary, you cannot hide your skin colour so easily. 

&gt;I would also argue that criticism of a political party in a free and open democracy is fundamentally different from political violence.

Criticism of a political party in a free and open democracy is fundamentally GOOD within reason and I don't think we have got the stage where ""within reason"" has been passed. I have seen some [VERY nasty things said about Ukippers on Twitter](http://i.imgur.com/t7zUDex.jpg) but abuse is an internet thing - seemingly anything can provoke death threats/wishes but ""real world"" attacks are very rare and people are usually just venting anger.  

Where I do depart from agreeing with you is that the current debate on UKIP is in fact a political debate. Certainly the character and beliefs of politicians is important. Politicians will be asked to react to crises and the unforeseen and their character and beliefs will shape the policy and action that is used to deal with it.  However I think the debate on UKIP has unnecessarily focused on a minority of individuals. Yes these individuals either hold unpleasant beliefs or are racially insensitive ( and racially insensitive individuals are *sometimes* individuals with veiled racial hatred and sometimes just individuals that are going to tell you ""how it is"" in plain and simple language whilst still treating everyone equally regardless of race ). However these unpleasant individuals are not realistically going to hold important positions and when they are outed they are kicked out of the party. But more importantly  UKIP is a party espousing a political viewpoint that could have serious influence over whether we stay in or leave europe. It is possible they could have a serious influence on our immigration policy. Except Ukips critics rarely attack the policy or make a positive case for europe or ""immigration policy"" ( instead perferring  to focus on the immigrants themselves) . Ukips critics haven't won the Europe debate or the immigration debate because they have refused to take on the policy. Instead they focus on the character of a minority of individuals that are about to get kicked out or be marginalised by the party. It comes across more as a smear campaign that a true debate of ideas. 

My other point of departure is that the mindset of ""dismiss a whole group of people based on the actions of a few"" shouldn't be encouraged as an acceptable thinking strategy even when it's applied to white, middle-aged, middle-class men.  I would maintain that from my experience the greatest predictor of ""prejudice"" against a group ( in the absence of top down societal encouragement ) - whether it's against racial groups or belief groups is

A) Did the person suffer a impacting negative experience from a person/persons within that group, without having at least an equal number of impacting positive experiences of people from the same group ?

B) Did the person then start pre-judging people, applying their negative expectations to all people in the group,  completely ignoring ""good"" members.

It's this thought meme of ""one or two are bad so the whole lot is rotten"" that is very prevalent in society. Evidently it's worse to apply it to race that to political belief in modern society BUT I would argue we have to kill the idea that ""an small number of individuals can set the standard for the whole group"" if we are going to kill prejudice. It is a ""thought meme""  and if it is acceptable to apply to one group ( the white, middle-aged men of UKIP ) then it becomes acceptable to apply to other groups.  This is why I think that the ""one or two members can be used to pre-judge the whole group"" thinking-strategy needs to be replaced with a more balanced attitude that looks for both the good and the bad and decided on that. I genuinely believe that people are people all over the world and once we learn to get over our fear of difference and approach each other with an open mind and a positive attitude we find we have far more in common that we do apart.  However people from different groups be they racial, ethnic, religious or political groups will only come together if they don't allow the broad brush strokes of ""tarring a whole group because that group had a few bad members in it"" to get in the way. 

Sorry for the wall of text - hopefully it's readable.

The Nuggets weren't even a playoff team with out him (a football comparison would be like if Liverpool didn't finish top 7). We just sold one of the best players in football that was so uniquely good at what he did that it forced Rodgers to completely 180° his tactical approach to the game while he was here. Give the man time. Give Balotelli time to adapt his play style. Give Lovren/Skrtel time to grow as a pair. Give Gerrard time to adapt to captaining these new players and figuring out how to get the best of the players around him. Give Lallana time to find his place in the time. Give some time before you blow the team up and see if for some unexplainable reason the return of a 20+ goal scorer changes Rodgers approach to the game.

If you play two strikers and they aren't playing how you need them to play you're losing the numbers game in your own 1/3 of the pitch without the extra benefit of additional chances on goal.

There is no way everything will go our way this season considering all the new players brought in and what we lost in Suarez. Some undeveloped players may not pan out, others may actually begin to fade, a head case may never 'get it', and hell Rodgers may prove to us that he was simply a product of Suarez's greatness.

How often have we seen RB to CB, CB to CB, CB to Gerrard and then he plays it either long to an attacker (predictable) or back to the CB (and repeat X 5). 

Emre can collect the ball and run at the opposing midfielders, this can create openings for the forward line and is great at gaining vital territory across the pitch. His dribbling is impressive IMO. An unsuccessful dribble/broken down play leaves him out of position and Chelsea are some of the most at counter attacking. This is an issue, but his forward runs are normally well timed and not mindless. 

He also has a good passing range. His long passing needs improving from what I've seen but his short and quick passes are tidy and welcome in our dry midfield. He also provides a useful outlet for our defence and Gerrard to pick out from the back. 
I understand your point about his positioning and mediocre work rate but I would take his qualities over Allen (in his form) and Coutinho in the middle at the moment. Henderson hasn't been particularly spectacular in recent games either. Can offers us a positive and potentially explosive presence in the midfield that we are crying out for in our current state.

This new afterlife is not nearly as pleasant. Whether it's true or not, you're told that your body is still linked to your consciousness. Anything that happens to it, happens to you.

This is pretty much a representation of Hell.

There has been no heaven shown in this episode and if the children watching it haven't seen the library episode they may not understand that the afterlife shown is a simulation.

The smart ones that do may then start asking what has happened to Danny Pink. Where is he? They may not see him as being dead, after all, he's still there talking to Clara.

Some of the children watching this may be at the age where they struggle to separate fact from fiction.  
Maybe they've also lost a loved one themselves, like a grandparent.

I won't deny I suffered from ""regeneration morning"" or ""regeneration remorse"" whatever you want to call it. 

I can honestly say though now that the first series is ended that I'm not a huge fan of 12. He's just not my type of guy. I love the actor but not the doctor. I still enjoy the show, just not as much. But I am basis in a few ways. I still loved peter as the cardinal in the musketeers so I'm a little sore over losing him there. That and I really loved Matt Smith.

I'd say that I'm ok with the darker approach but I don't like how they are going about it. Many of the episodes this series felt predictable. The trailers felt incredibly misleading. And the writing in some of the episodes felt lazy.

Frankly bringing back ""you know who"" (cant remember how to spoiler comments) just felt predictable to me. There were a plethora of villains that it could have been but you chose that one. IDK. Maybe I'm being too hard on moffat. Maybe I just thought about it too much. But it seemed so obvious to me that I didn't feel an ounce of shock, just disappointment. The one twist I did like was who the dead people actually were. That one was staring me in the face and I missed it and that made me really happy.

First, he doesn't have anywhere near the pace of Valencia or Sakho.  Those bastards are quick, and Andy'd be gassed just trying to keep up with them.

Second -- and I'll grant that this may be a function of our primary approach to things last season -- he doesn't commit to the attack.  If Valencia or Sakho start on a tear down their half of the pitch, Andy needs to be moving with them, or the effort will be wasted.  Granted, either Valencia or Sakho can pretty much outrun anybody they come across, but there have been times where they've had to play off each other.  

Third (I lied, deal with it) -- he has terrible situational awareness.  I stopped keeping track of all the times I'd see him in midfield last season -- but again, that may be a function of how we were playing.  Now that we're not completely dependent on set pieces for our goals, he may surprise us.  Who knows.

Isn't having a show that gets the ball rolling in people's minds about the bigger questions *better* than the passive, watch-and-shut-down mindset? 

I mean, it's not like the show hasn't done this before. Utopia, and the end of the universe being nothing but darkness that humanity *lobotimized* itself to try to forget about, comes to mind. Heck, just *think* about the Reality Bomb/Ultimate Sanction. That would have, crazily in a meta-sense, affected *us*.

The fact is, this isn't the Tellytubbies reading I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream, or The Saturday Morning Funtime Christopher Hitchens Hour.

As for the parents explaining the afterlife to their children... If kids watch Doctor Who, then they've seen death. If they like Daleks, especially.

My number one choice at the moment would be Schneiderlin. He looks quality, and quite clearly wanted out over the summer. Yes, So'ton are playing well, and currently doing quite a lot better than we are, but they will always struggle to hold what they have due to their stature compared with the teams that will be interested in their players. The same as we lose out to your Madrid/Barca's etc.

I think Schneiderlin will still want a club that could offer him CL football, and we should make the most of that while we still have the appeal.I hope we buck up our ideas before January otherwise I do worry we'll sink back down the ladder in terms of appealing to players.

If we do qualify for the CL again next year, I genuinely believe we'll get some high profile transfers. We lost out on some big names like Sanchez because we weren't a sure bet to keep qualifying, but doing it in back to back years would really add some merit to our ambition.

Cybermen and Daleks are superficially similar in that they're both powerful, genocidal robotic conversions of species.

However, Daleks are very similar to the Doctor. They travel the universe exterminating things they consider to be ""the enemy"" with almost no hesitation, they are an exotic alien species, their society crumbled around them as they grew up, they've largely abandoned their own home planet, and they try to shape and view the universe in a way that exemplifies what they consider to be the best emotion (excitement in the case of the Doctor, and hatred in the case of the Daleks).

Cybermen, in contrast, are the opposite of everything the Doctor wants to be and everything he sees in the human race. They're emotionless, they convert the unwilling, and they wish to remove uniqueness throughout the cosmos. Where Daleks simply want to destroy all humans, Cybermen want to trap them and turn them into new recruits, which is an act that the Doctor finds horrifically repugnant and will not take any part in on his own, as opposed to murder, which he's absolutely fine with once he's convinced himself that something is a ""monster""; in classic Who he was even sentenced by Time Lord tribunal to lose regenerations after wantonly exterminating an entire species largely on a gut feeling (he got them back later, of course).

&gt;Its a combination of a lot of things, like not rushing it, steadying yourself and not thinking too hard about it, making it like a muscle reflex almost.

This is spot on. When I played, I found that if I tried too hard, or focused too much, just tried to force it, I couldn't finish, and then I'd get frustrated and it would just get worse. But when I just calmed down and relaxed, and just remembered to have fun with it, I found scoring was easy. When you try too hard, you can go to quick and get a sort of ""tunnel vision"". But when you slow down and relax, it's not that difficult to just put the ball where the keeper is not. And I found this to be the case, not just for shooting, but my overall game. 

Look, for example, at Schürlle right now. He's desperately trying to score. It's painfully obvious that he's trying too hard and he's forcing it. We've all seen what he can do when he's on his game, but he just needs to get some confidence back and relax.

Him and Coutinho are suffering from not being able to feed anybody balls. I think they'll flourish when Sturridge comes back and we have him and Balo upfront.

Lovren seems to have come down with Liverpool defender syndrome and forgotten basic rules of defending. I think at this point I'm going to really start looking at our coaching methods for our defense. We have Skrtel, Agger, Sakho and Lovren who are all good defenders. It seems no matter who we buy, we have the same issues. If that's the case, it seems more than a coincidence. I think we'll have big defensive issues until our coaching changes.

Lambert was never bought to add quality, he was definitely added for depth, but the problem is he doesn't fit in our system, but again at the moment our system is definitely flawed. We seem to isolate our lone striker and barely involve our midfield in slow back-passing build up play.

I'm fine with critiquing  players, but every game we play on rotation seems to produce the same toothless display. Rodgers' tactics so far this season have been lacking. We've reverted to his early Liverpool side in trying to keep possession in our own half. Other teams then setup to press us out of it and we get overrun by the likes of QPFUCKINGR.

But on addressing areas needing quality. We looked so much better defensively with a proper holding player in Lucas. If we added someone like Schneiderlin who is not only a very good DM, but a very good passer and presser of the game, it would solve a problem that we do have.

I realise this is an essay, but at the moment the only area I think we're properly lacking quality in is defensive mid and we could probably do with a good backup to Sturridge that Mario can play off whenever Sturridge gets injured.

Edit: When I was talking about our CB's, I included Agger because I meant to add that they've all played solidly under other managers or like in Sakho's case when playing internationally. It's only in our system do these defenders start looking the shaky players we watch week in/week out.

Henderson is capable on the right, and him on Borini on the flanks would add so much work-rate to help the fullbacks or midfield close down attacks. Can and Lucas would also shield the back and smother the play. Late on I would put on Coutinho/Stevie etc to try and open it up.

You're changing the statement. You said ""the majority of rootkits and trojans are installed without any user interaction"". However your latest statement refers to only threats blocked. The number of threats blocked is not relevant to your original statement, however the number of trojans, of which are installed without user interaction is. With that statement in itself, it is poor as we don't know how many threats weren't blocked, and how many of these non-blocked threats were or were not automatically installed.

I cannot find a source to say that the majority (lets say over 50%) of rootkits and trojans ever created, are installed without user interaction. I picked up on your wording deliberately because I knew it would be exceedingly difficult for you to prove.

&gt;Is this some semantic flim-flam you're hoping to divulge in? Because the only way to avoid ""interacting"" is to not go online in any way

Kind of flimflam, yes. My original point is that 'expert' computer users do not need AV. That is to say, the type of user which understands the threats, is aware of their own attack surface, and has mitigated said risks through means other than an AV. For example through sandboxing, virtual machines, executable restriction, airgaping, etc.

&gt;Which though effective, is less practical than simply using a good AV.

It very much depends on your use case. Sometimes, using an AV is a negative cost-benefit.
