Shale gas is right there, we know the techniques work, and we have the infrastructure to start using gas right away. We are currently spending £5bn per year buying gas from Qatar and shipping it here on big ships.  Around 50% of the UK consumption comes from them. That sounds pretty dumb when we have enormous amounts of it under our own soil. 

Sure, it's a quick buck but as renewables take over, the gas will become worth less and less - so why not sell it now and get the money while demand is high? There are a number of benefits - it will make lots of jobs here in the UK. We stop giving Qatar billions per year for their dodgy government. We can also sell to Europe, freeing them from the grasp of Russia. And finally, we should absolutely take some of the profit and invest it into renewables.

true,piouiy,null,null,"&gt;Worth noting that Osborne missed every single one of the economic targets he set himself a few years ago. The Tories have presided over three years of economic stagnation when they promised otherwise. They have failed by their very own metrics.

The deficit has still been cut dramatically - just not quite as quickly as Osborne said he would do it. So yeah, he missed targets but they aren't the only metric for success. Things like the credit rating were definitely silly things to promise though, but as we can see, the effect of being downgraded to AA was bugger all anyway.

But let's be honest - he can't win. Everyone was moaning 2 years ago that they were cutting too hard and that things were slow to recover. If the economy stagnated, it's because he cut too hard. If the economy stagnated, it's because they didn't do enough. There's no winning really - he's always going to get the blame.

Again, you need to be reasonable. Osbourne couldn't have predicted an EU-wide crisis, instability in the middle east, russia invading ukraine or any other things which can affect our economy.

&gt;What I'd like to know is whether more trains are laid on to increase services. If not - they're very much profiting.

So are you saying that extra services do not run at rush hour? That rush hour trains are not longer? That more staff aren't needed on rush hour ticket barriers and platforms? I'm sorry but its you thats going round in circles here.

&gt;I don't need figures

Thankfully I do and they show that you're point isn't quite so self evident as you think.

&gt;- On a typical autumn weekday in 2012, 536,000 passengers arrived into central London (Zone 
1 of the TfL travelcard area) during the three hour morning peak (07:00 to 09:59). This was a 
0.6 per cent increase from 2011. Across the whole day 981,000 passengers arrived into 
central London by rail, a 0.9 per cent increase from 2011. 
 
&gt;- Birmingham had the highest number of passengers travelling outside London, with 36,000 
passengers on trains arriving into the city centre in the morning peak and 106,000 across the 
whole day. Manchester had the next highest number of passengers travelling outside London 
with 27,000 arrivals in the morning peak, followed by Leeds with 23,000 and Liverpool with 
20,000. 

From the [department of transport themselves](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/252516/rail-passengers-crowding-2012-revised.pdf).

So in London in the Autumn (when presumably there are less tourists who are more likely to travel off peak) you are right that peak travellers outnumber offpeak, but not by that much. And in most other cities off peak travellers actually outnumber peak ones.

&gt;It might not straight away - at least we'd have increased control over it and it would function more as a service than a cash cow. Not sure why you're not getting that but feel free to do your research on this Sub - I'm not the first or last to suggest it.

A) Point me to a company with obscene profit margins in the rail industry? This idea that private companies in old nationalised industries are using them as a 'cash cow' is taken as true by default on this sub mostly, when in fact there is very little evidence of that.

B) I'd rather do my research based on actual evidence and studies not a random group of mostly young left wingers on the internet. At no point has anyone with any authority suggested a nationalised rail service would have flat pricing and all past evidence (again BR and East Coast, which you seem to keep ignoring) shows that they wouldn't use it.

I also think that equating the two is dangerous. The BNP are hugely demonised, and so equating people with them is effectively saying they are so wrong that their views aren't worth engaging with.

Believing UKIP supporters are effectively the same as BNP supporters is just dismissing them and making it easier for you to box them off as 'loony'.

Modern society somewhat acts as though you're a demon if you don't move along with it without effectively providing levels of demonism.  

I mean my Nan was racist...... but she wasn't an out and out, I wouldn't put her next to Hitler, she might nod in agreement with Enoch Powell but she wouldn't write that speech. If you just quizzed her long enough it would come out and even then it was oft casual as opposed to being imbued with an inner hatred....... and she was so old, how can you change that?   
That sort of distinction of demon level is never applied which is possibly why people feel so alienated and why UKIP has appeal. They don't want to be the demons anymore. Some racism in a generation is understandable to a degree as it correlates (IMO) to experience and a lot of the older generations just have no personal experience of different races or sexual preferences.

true,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"Skrtel's company in the ""most clearances"" table is informative; the other players are from shit teams who spent most of the season under the cosh and defending desperately. The fact that Skrtel was called upon to make as many clearances as those guys shows where our defensive problems lie: in the midfield.

I would not be surprised to see that Skrtel's clearances-per-90-minutes decreased as Gerrard grew into his defensive role.

For all the stick Skrtel's getting from assorted whoppers in this thread, he's a fine defender who's had a fine season in trying circumstances. The problems with our defence are structural, not a personnel issue. I believe that Sakho and Skrtel can make a decent SAS partnership at the back. Skrtel's more of a reactive player, who will back off, narrow the angle, and try to block a shot. Sakho's proactive: he'll step out of the line to make a challenge. That's a great combination.

All it will take over the close season is a fine tuning of tactical intelligence: the ability to cover for full-backs who are caught out in attacking positions; when a midfielder is supposed to drop in between the centre backs as they go wide and when the midfielder is supposed to hold in front of them; that sort of thing.

Rodgers built an attacking unit with incredible tactical intelligence last season; I think he can do the same for the defence this season in the same way: by getting the most out of his existing personnel.",0,1400600813,null,0,false,0,chmoyo9,t3_260p71,t1_chmoyo9,t3_260p71,null,1433878210,12,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,12

I'd not be surprised if its rarely the readers complaining, but people who don't (usually/ever) read that paper complaining.

Think about the Jonathan Ross - Andrew Sachs incident. Very few of the complaints were from JR listeners.  
If Wossy had half the listeners, would there have been half the complaints? (Or to use your example, if he'd had nine times the listeners, you'd expect nine times the complaints.)

I'm sure the same its a similar story with the Mails hatchet job on Milibands dad, some complaints from regular DM readers, some (I would guess majority, but I've no stats) from non readers.

If the guardian put out a similar story, I'm sure that would attract a similar number of complaints. 

EDIT - maybe the ""anti DM"" crowd are more likely to make complaints than the ""anti guardian"" crowd (though I'd imagine ""disgusted of Tunbridge Wells"" is more likely to be a DM reader than a Guardianista), so maybe ""number of complaints"" IS a shitty metric. but dividing it by readership makes no sense.",0,1400602620,null,0,1400603708,0,chmpu1t,t3_260nqw,t1_chmpu1t,t1_chmjggn,null,1433878698,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

For my side, that it is the main reason why I support Labour instead.  And also why I respect your support of the Conservatives.

Honestly, I don't know where to stand when it comes to the economy.  The growth can't be denied, but I also think it is too soon to say how long it will help in the long run.  My belief is that really you need to invest whilst performing austerity - in other words, yes if you spending beyond your means, you should stop that, but you should also keep into consideration what areas should keep investment so as to boost growth in the long run.  I think what the Tories have done, fixes the deficit, but creates a relatively stagnant economy.  The Brown-era Labour policy would have straight up failed though (Ed's is too soon to say, but I think it could work).

As for my personal stake.  I come from a poor family, like in the early 90s, my family used to receive food parcels during Christmas.  My single mum is trying to make ends meet nowadays by working behind a bar, whilst being supplemented by welfare.  When I was six, I had cancer and spent a year at a London hospital to be treated. I'm currently a PhD student (having gotten through undergraduate using student loans and now receiving money as part of a research grant) at university, trying to work hard to break the working class cycle and be in a position where I can get my family out of an uncomfortable financial situation.  

In the past five years, the Tories have cut so much.  I've seen research colleagues at my university be made redundant because the university decided to cut funding to the department to make up for lack of government subsidies.  My mum has gone from living a semi-reasonable financial life, to struggling to make ends meet.  I've seen the NHS get semi-privatised, and cuts made in various areas including cancer treatment.

The fact is, although I accept the Tory viewpoint as a valid alternative, I could never bring myself to support the Conservatives - because their policies seem to despise my very existence...",0,1400602657,null,0,1400603030,0,chmpupe,t3_260qjg,t1_chmpupe,t1_chmj2ee,null,1433878706,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

There is an obvious difference between a group of MEN and a group of CHILDREN.

There is a huge problem with organized crime coming from Romania, and no-one wants to talk about the obvious solution. A POINTS BASED IMMIGRATION SYSTEM + BACKGROUND CHECKS.

I hear people talking about how we need to ""solve the root causes of crime"", yet how are we supposed to do that when the root cause is poverty in Romania? People think that we have some sort of omnipotent ability to solve every problem on Earth.

The OBVIOUS solution to the problem is what Farage suggests, a stricter immigration system.

That way, we let in skilled Romanians with no criminal records, and we keep out people who either wouldn't contribute much to the economy or who HAVE criminal records.

This is the common sense solution but those on the left wing don't want to talk about it, because they're so fanatically devoted to the idea of ""free movement of people"" that they would rather see Romanian organized crime on our streets than any sort of immigration reform. And so all the left does is try to distract attention away from this issue with constant cries of ""racism!!"" all the while the public, and anyone who has been a victim of these gangs can see the obvious solution.

The reason everyone attacks the Greens for those two things is because the Greens are supposed to be environmentally friendly; that's the entire premise of their party. When their policies will cause the exact opposite of their goal, of course they are going to be savagely criticized for it.

There are far more things to criticize them for. Going into the EU elections they are going against ITER (the EU fusion power plant project) as part of their EU parliament coalition.

By this argument people wouldn't request shit music on the radio anymore.... but there is still the odd Gareth Gates request. These people have had over a decade now to find good quality music.... but they haven't, it drives me fucking crazy!!!  
I bet you anything that the girl I heard on the radio asking for Mr Gates a decade after he weaseled out that piece of shit will continue to blemish the airwaves forever with that song. She'll probably even play it at her fucking funeral even though she had her entire life to figure out that any respectable song writer that rhymes ""deeper"" and ""weaker"" is not respectable.  
But hey, she has her blinkers on, she likes that song, I don't hate her for it, I'm just never going to be friends with her.

Another question, why do you play on the ignorance of Reddit and many other people when it comes to technology and try to push it in your favour? You blatantly lie about technology and what it does, especially when it comes to areas like privacy, patents and copyright.

The only thing you ever bring up to back any of your policies is this 'we have medium and small business' completely ignorant of the fact that, hey maybe small and medium companies also have patents and make use of copyright to protect their products too, against larger ones as well. It seems to me that you've never actually spoke to many of these medium and small business that you claim to represent or who you claim can replace the other 50% of business that will be lost due to your short sighted policies. If UKIP were serriously advocating getting rid of 50% of business then people here sure as hell wouldn't be supporting them, why should I support you?

Your only response to this is 'but the larger ones have legal teams blah blah'. To me it just seems like you have done very little research on it at all apart from reading garbage like TechDirt or Huffington Post and then basing your whole party from it. You then use these lies to spread misinformation and mislead a ton of people into falling into your arms.

If you're employed by someone or a company then they automatically deduct your Income Tax and National Insurance (the latter is ostensibly to pay for the National Health Service and benefits but really it's a tax by a different name). For those two you're looking at around 25% deduction from your wages.

There's nothing for you to do (like an annual tax return) unless you're Self Employed.

You'll want to get a National Insurance Number and Tax Code asap as if you don't you'll go on an ""emergency"" code that deducts a higher amount.

If you're planning to be self employed then you'll have to register with HMRC as such and pay your NI through a quarterly bill manually. You'll also have to submit an annual Self Assessment.

Value Added Tax (sales tax) is automatically added to the goods it apples to (everything apart from most foods and kids clothing basically).

There are other things called ""tax"" like Council Tax, but that's what you have to pay to the local authority (council) for living in a house. Make sure you register for and pay this as they can be very litigious. If you're renting in a shared house this will probably be covered as part of the rent. 

Car ""Tax"" has to be bought if you want to run a car. You do that online nowadays.

I can't hep with the bank advice sorry, but I'd have thought all of the major high street banks are much of a muchness and use the same rules. Someone can correct me though. You can use this site to pick a bank if you're more interested in an ethical offering.

There is an obvious difference between a group of MEN and a group of CHILDREN.

Except that Farage didn't try to justify himself by saying there was a difference between men and children, he started going on about Romanians doing human trafficking.

Which is why the Conservatives, the great bastion of left wing thinking, also support our membership of the EU and open borders?

&gt; There is a huge problem with organized crime coming from Romania, and no-one wants to talk about the obvious solution. A POINTS BASED IMMIGRATION SYSTEM + BACKGROUND CHECKS.

Another solution is greater integration. You wouldn't suggest solving lower wages in the north of the UK by building a big wall through the Midlands, and only letting people through with certain skills.

And, again, this debacle didn't come from Farage suggesting he wanted a points based immigration system. It didn't come from Farage saying there is higher crime and more poverty in Romania. It came from Farage saying he would feel uncomfortable with Romanian neighbours, and that he stereotyped Romanian people as people traffickers. Farage himself has complained about politicians moving the goal posts on issues like the EU, yet his supporters can't see they're moving the goal posts on issues like this, acting like there is controversy around an issue where there simply isn't, then strawmanning their opponents because of that.

true,Dzerzhinsky,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"[Disclaimer: I hold a lot of unconventional views, so, in the spirit of being helpful, on these topics I try just to answer from the perspective of a dispassionate bourgeois politico.]

I think it's much more complicated that most discussions make it sound, and it really comes down to what you want the EU to be.

Do we want to have a total Parliamentary system in Europe where the MEPs initiate and solely legislate things?  This would ostensibly be more democratic since it would be like Westminster.

But the Parliament is a supra-national institution, and in such a case we've just removed the Council of Ministers, which is (supposed to be) the only inter-governmental institution.  So the governments of member-states no longer have a direct say in legislation.  Is this more democratic or less democratic?  It probably comes down to your view of what democracy is in the modern world.

We can stretch this the other way.  What if we abolish the EU, but we want to keep many of the market/political gains we've made.  We probably make everything inter-governmental with no elected Parliament like most other international relations.  Is this more democratic now that it's all done by government without direct citizen input?

The main problem people have with the Commission seems to be that it's the only institution that can initiate legislation and it isn't directly elected.  There are three points to be made here.

First, that as of this election the Commission President will (probably) be the candidate of the largest group (EPP, centre-right, or S&amp;D, centre-left), and then the whole Commission will have to be voted on by the Parliament.  In this way it isn't too dissimilar to a Parliamentary system -- we didn't directly elect Cameron to be PM either.  One of the main differences, of course, is that the Commission President doesn't control Parliament like the PM does, and I consider this to be a good thing.

As a side-note to this for anyone unaware, the Commission has hitherto been chosen by the member-states.  Indeed, this time around some governments (like the UK) are still trying to prevent the Parliament from getting its way by proposing ""compromise candidates"".

Second, most legislation is proposed by the Council or the Parliament, rather than just being made up by the Commission.

Third, the Commission is largely there to enforce the treaties and implement decisions, much like a civil service.  These parts of the Commission you probably don't want to be democratic.

To come back to your question, is this all a very undemocratic arrangement?  Well, it isn't a direct democracy with everyone voting on everything, so it's going to have limitations.  I think as time goes on it's increasingly taking on the form of a representative democracy and a lot of the criticisms are unfair (they tend to assume that the Parliament literally just says 'yes' or 'no' to the odd scrap of paper thrown at it).

But I also think it has significant limitations.  What these limitations are and how to fix them is a question probably nobody will be able to agree on until we can come to a common vision of what the EU should be and how much of a say governments should have in what it does.

Personally, I also think that one of the major problems is the lack of a demos for the Parliament.  We see this in the UK both historically and today.  In the past the EU elections have served as a protest against the national government.  Today we see much of the same thing, alongside it being a referendum on membership.

This is a problem because it means that we aren't holding the politicians or parties accountable for what they do in the European Parliament.  They could do literally anything they want (or nothing at all) and we'd still vote for or against them on the basis of something they have absolutely nothing to do with.  If elections aren't at least somewhat about policies or accountability is this not a cataclysmic failure of democracy?  But on this final point we only have ourselves to blame.

As both Farage and some of his supporters have hinted at, the reason some Romanians are pushed towards crime is because of the low wages and poverty in Romania.

The solution I support is more cooperation between countries to increase living standards in countries where they are low. I always try to make the comparison to similar issues in the UK. If somewhere in the UK suffers from low quality of life, people suggest trying to increase that by spending more government money there, and encouraging businesses to open there. I support stuff like that on a larger scale, and I think as one of the most privileged countries and people in the world, we all have an obligation to do that on a wider scale as well.

But that's just my politics, and, as I said in the last post, has little to do with the controversy around what Farage said.

A) You said earlier you don't believe Farage is a racist, but you just stated that you don't understand me calling him not a racist? So you do think he is? or what? I'm confused.

B) Yes I am defending him. Like i would defend Milliband over this train wreck (http://order-order.com/2014/05/20/listen-milibands-radio-wiltshire-clusterfk/) that just came out. I don't think its fair to judge politicians who are quite human over these sort of comments. I detest it when people take it out of context and exaggerate these claims as political ammunition. Its politics yes, but pretty lowest common denominator stuff.

C) No i don't believe Romanian's count as a race. One of my Grandparents wasn't English does that make me mixed-race? I believe the reason racism is such a big deal is because its a character that you cannot change, nationality and culture can't be used to identify someone like race can, nationality and culture can be changed. I believe that people who label everyone a racist are dangerous, they are trivialising a serious issue

D)I think the correct word would be prejudice, the comment if it is to be acknowledged at all is prejudice. I think that Farage is probably a bit prejudiced, but i also think everyone is and that is a trait we can overcome with some education. I also think prejudice is less of a serious issue as it can occur over all manner of things.

E) I would wait until he actually comments about something due to someones race before i use the racist label.

Correlation != causation... and this isn't really enough to count as correlation anyway.  By my reckoning, the last five recessions before the recent one (1990, 1980, 1973, 1961, 1956) all started under Conservative governments.  There are clearly lots of things that affect economic growth other than which party happens to be in power at the moment.  If you are going to vote on the basis of looking at how well the economy seems to be doing right now and assuming that the current government is responsible, you might as well just flip a coin.

&gt; One more thing, DC's support for same-sex marriage was very important to me - I was proud that it was the UK's centre-right party which introduced it.

Given that a majority of the Conservative MPs were against it, the Lib Dems were almost unanimously in favour of it, and the Lib Dems announced their support for it before the election but the Conservatives didn't, do you honestly think it would have gone ahead under a majority Conservative government?

Sites for sharing illegal content have already been blocked by the courts, not through the filter, so not sure how ""the debate"" was bypassed?

&gt; Websites to do with sexual health, sex addiction, child protection services, drug advice, and suicide prevention have all been blocked in the short time the filters have been implemented for (Smith, 2013)

There will always be a few false positives, especially to begin with. How many legitimate sites are still blocked? If you still want to have access to those categories you can [choose them](http://torrentfreak.com/images/talktalk.png)

Or, you could just turn the filter off if you don't like it. Talking about poor and old people as if they are fucking idiots doesn't help anyone. When they sign up to a new internet service, they are told they are getting this. If they don't want it they can choose not to. If they don't opt out, and they want to access a site that is blocked it tells them it's blocked and how to get it unblocked.

The same system has been in place on mobile phones for years.

A more serious example, what if someone commits a crime, pays their debt to society and tries to start anew, but a simple google search brings it up?

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyJcF1qfHfY) the interview in which they discuss it. And don't they plan on abolishing tax on minimum wage workers? Then a flat tax starting further up the income scale?

Environmental: what you've stated isn't a policy, it's an opinion. Their [policy](http://www.ukipmeps.org/uploads/file/energy-policy-2014-f-20-09-2013.pdf) involves fracking in the short term and building nuclear power stations in the long term. And also cleaning up coal power stations. Fracking may be related to a fall of CO2 emission in the US [1](http://cnsnews.com/mrctv-blog/barbara-boland/us-co2-emissions-lowest-level-20-years-thanks-fracking). [2](http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/05/americas-falling-carbon-dioxide-emissions). And could help the UK [1](http://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2013/jul/16/bowland-shale-fracking-uk-economy-co2-emissions). Nuclear power is very clean and is considered [low carbon](http://www.edfenergy.com/energyfuture/energy-gap-climate-change/nuclear-and-the-energy-gap-climate-change). However, you may say there is nuclear waste and a danger of another Chernobyl/Fukushima. Fukushima was an extreme circumstance and Chernobyl was human error. Due to what we learnt from Chernobyl, another disaster similar to that is very unlikely.

So, regardless of what UKIP believe, their energy policy should reduce UK carbon emissions anyway.

Foreign Policy:

&gt;They're the fucking UKIP

isn't a policy.

&gt;Going independent from EU is fucking dumb and they have no plans what to do afterwards.

what makes it fucking dumb? It's to my understanding that there are equally good reasons on either side.

true,MotoZ98,null,null,"&gt; The solution I support is more cooperation between countries to increase living standards in countries where they are low. I always try to make the comparison to similar issues in the UK. If somewhere in the UK suffers from low quality of life, people suggest trying to increase that by spending more government money there, and encouraging businesses to open there. I support stuff like that on a larger scale, and I think as one of the most privileged countries and people in the world, we all have an obligation to do that on a wider scale as well.

So let me get this clear, your totally realistic solution is to *magically solve all the problems on Earth and all poverty*?

&gt;The solution I support is more cooperation between countries to increase living standards in countries where they are low.

THESE ARE JUST WORDS.

What does this ""cooperation"" manifest as? What, do you we just get on the telephone to Romania and suddenly fix poverty? 

You aren't saying anything of substance. ""Co-operate more"". Co-operate HOW?

&gt;encouraging businesses to open there

""Encourage"". More empty words. Encourage them HOW? We just get on the phone to businesses and tell them to open in Romania? Or we give them financial incentives...? What are you actually saying?

You do realize that even if what you were promoting (and you aren't actually promoting anything clear and concise as far as I can tell, merely blind symbolic idealistic gestures and nice sounding slogans) was possible, which it isn't, it would likely take numerous generations to fix..

So you want to carry on flooding the country with criminal gangs on the off chance that in 100 years we can fix poverty in every single country in Earth so that there are magically no criminals at all. Right. 

&gt;As long as it is democratic and accountable, I don't see why not.

Greater concentration of power leads to greater potential for abuse of power. The EU commission which has the sole right to propose legislation for 500 million people, is composed of 28 individuals who are APPOINTED, who never have to appear on a public ballot, and who we have no way of removing at all. 

It seems to me that if anything of what you say about your own beliefs is true, you should be anti-EU

Under AVB we were generally rubbish at creating any sort of chances, so it's hard to say whether it was the style which didn't suit him or just poor performances from the rest of the team.  I guess if one considered ineffective build up play to be part of our style then yes, the style didn't suit him.  Under Sherwood we haven't really had much of a coherent or consistent style, so once again it's hard to say.

Do you believe Soldado will fit the style of play that any of the prospective managers play?

You'd have to hope so.  I think any system which utilises plenty of width should free up more space for him between the lines, and this is something that I'd be hoping for from our next manager. 

In your eyes is Soldado a flop? Why or why not?

Yes and no.  It's impossible to argue that his debut season has gone well, so in that sense he has been a flop, but I don't really think it's sensible to judge him yet.  Yes he cost a lot of money but just SAY he scored 30 goals next season and fired us into the Champions League.  That would be worth more to the club than his transfer fee.  I'd say let's wait until the end of next season (if he's still here) to label him a flop.

What would you like to see happen with Soldado over the next 12 months (retained? starting? bench?)?

Definitely retained and starting.  Can't see us signing anyone much better without CL football so I would hope to see him given a proper chance next season with a full preseason under his belt and a good rest from missing the World Cup.

If one cannot set out such a scenario then the deciding factor must have been the officer's use of the pepper spray, and we must then move to discussing how much responsibility the officer holds, i.e. whether it was incompetence that could have been avoided or whether the reaction was unpredictable and the response to his plight as strong as it should have been.

I enjoy cooking so I like to make my own food most of the time - fajitas, chili con carne, that sort of thing. If I get takeaway it's usually Dominos, Mosque Kitchen (Indian), Shanaz (Indian) or Jade Palace (Chinese).

ESA has links with the EU, and most countries that are members of one are members of the other, but it isn't an EU body.

&gt; The EU itself is highly undemocratic, its elected MEPS cannot make legislation, they can only vote for/against legislation. 

They can also amend legislation, and they have to approve the appointment of the Commission (the equivalent of the Cabinet, and the people who can introduce legislation) and can sack them at any time.  It's not really that different from Westminster, really.  The vast, vast majority of legislation passed by the UK Parliament is introduced by the government - opposition parties and backbenchers have opportunities to introduce legislation, but these opportunities are very limited and it is rarely successful.

Also, in my opinion, the European Parliament uses a far more democratic electoral system than the House of Commons.  Where I live, the local and Westminster elections are always foregone conclusions and the parties barely bother to make a show of campaigning, but that isn't really true of the European elections in any constituency.

&gt; The EU makes trade agreements on our behalf, which means some good but some bad trade agreements.

I'm not sure why this is a con rather than neutral, but a big part of the reason why the EU members club together on trade negotiations is because it gives them more clout.

&gt; Switzerland has more trade agreements than the EU itself!

It goes generally like this when you are just buying from someone who is just selling (i.e. You aren't selling and the sellers are not buying another house immediately)

* Arrange mortgage and get mortgage agreed in principle
* Search endlessly for houses, view several and disagree on the lampshades
* Find a house you want
* Put in offer
* Offer not accepted
* Put in higher offer
* Offer accepted, you've now not even technically bought the house, but it gets put down as ""SSTC"" or Sold Subject to Contract. 
* Contact mortgage company, get survey done
* Instruct your solicitors (oh wait, you didn't have any!?)
* Find solicitors, recommendations from friends and family are best
* Instruct solicitors
* Let Estate agent know all the details of the solicitors you're using
* Estate agent sends out Notice of Sale to all parties and solicitors
* You now pay the solicitors part of the search fees
* Buyers solicitors do nothing while they wait for the 'sellers pack' from the seller's solicitors. If they're good, they'll email the local council or use a website to get the local searches under way. 
* Sellers pack comes to your solicitors (and a copy sent to you) in a few weeks to a few months. This has the title deeds, plans, certificates, sellers inventory, etc for the house. The inventory states everything the sellers are leaving (including the carpets, light bulbs, door knobs, floor boards...etc).
* The buyer's solicitor finds there are things missing and sends enquiries to the seller's solicitor.
* The seller's solicitor sends the enquiries if relevant to the sellers.
* The sellers find out the information and send it back to their solicitors who then send it on to your solicitors who send it on to you.
* This raises more enquiries, and so the cycle of enquiries goes on for a few months.
* Eventually all the solicitors are happy with everything and arrange a date to exchange contracts (the stage we're at at the moment).
* The buyer's solicitor will ask the buyer to send over the deposit, the fees for doing the conveyancing and probably some other money for something that they did.
* The exchange (which is essentially a phone call to check wording on the contracts are the same) happens. You have now bought a house! You also know the completion date. Better insure it and tell the removal company you've been pestering for the past 3 weeks of your completion date.
* The completion date arrives and the solicitors whirl into action making sure the mortgage company sends the funds to the right account on the right day and everyone has the right money in the right place. This can happen quickly, or slowly, and usually happens by 2-3pm. 
* You can now collect your keys from the Estate agents and go into your newly bought house.",0,1400608012,null,0,false,0,chmsfbh,t3_261g82,t1_chmsfbh,t1_chmry3p,null,1433879918,2,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,2

So you're claiming we just close our borders and leave the EU and everything will magically get better in the UK? No? Well, neither am I. I'm not suggesting my ideology is the perfectly best solve everything instantly solution, I just think it is better than yours. I can't provide a 15 page dissertation backing up my ideology and shooting down yours, but neither can you. 

&gt; What does this ""cooperation"" manifest as? What, do you we just get on the telephone to Romania and suddenly fix poverty? 

As I said, I support a more integrated Europe. A Europe where it is easier to move funds and other support to places where they are needed. That's what cooperation is. 

&gt; ""Encourage"". More empty words. Encourage them HOW? We just get on the phone to businesses and tell them to open in Romania? Or we give them financial incentives...? What are you actually saying?

Being ideological, I support government run businesses, so you could essentially have the government (in this case a Europe wide one) setting up businesses in those countries for the good of the people. Being a bit more realistic, stuff like tax breaks. 

&gt; and you aren't actually promoting anything clear and concise as far as I can tell, merely blind symbolic idealistic gestures and nice sounding slogans

As opposed to the always concise and never misleading UKIP? Plus, at the end of the day, this is a reddit comment chain, not the potpan0 party manifesto.

&gt; Greater concentration of power leads to greater potential for abuse of power. The EU commission which has the sole right to propose legislation for 500 million people, is composed of 28 individuals who are APPOINTED, who never have to appear on a public ballot, and who we have no way of removing at all. 

Although this is the way UKIP have painted it, it isn't a case of either supporting the EU entirely as it is now, or wanting to leave. I support reform, to make the EU more federal, and if we can't achieve that, and the EU goes too far in the direction of opposing the well being of the people (such as supporting the Trans-Atlantic Trade Deal), I would support us leaving.",0,1400608107,null,0,false,0,chmsgxf,t3_260xbe,t1_chmsgxf,t1_chmrmod,null,1433879939,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

B) I agree that people shouldn't be judged on their mistakes. In this case I am very much judging Farage on the things that he meant to say i.e. the things he had committed to print, but there is definitely some value in listening to what people say when they haven't had a chance to think about it properly, although you should always give them a chance to explain themselves. To be honest, I think you may be talking about an incident that I am not aware of. 

C) I think whether or not Romanian counts as a race comes down to a semantic argument. Most dictionaries will include national/ethnic groups as a definition of race, but this isn't really the point. If the sticking point as to whether or not something is racist is over whether the target of the hatred is a race or not, it really can't be a good thing regardless of the answer. I don't believe that calling it racist trivialises it at all, quite the opposite in fact.

D) Again, whether or Farage himself is prejudiced is a difficult thing to gauge. He's a crafty politician who certainly knows his audience. He encourages and perpetuates prejudice among others. To what end is unclear.
I fail to see how prejudice of any kind is not extremely serious.

Wonderful, a dictionary definition of manslaughter.

That's a deliberately dishonest comparison. The train driver does not have the ability to stop the train in time for any suicide jumper and the comparison is flawed in a deep way because the man who jumps in front of the train does so for his own reasons, whereas the man in this scenario jumped into the lake as a result of the police officer. The death of the suicide jumper is not a result of the actions of the train driver and short of not turning up for work he could not have prevented it; and had he not done so, someone else would have done the job for him and now they'd be the one in the seat.

true,wherearemyfeet,null,null,"&gt;Quick question: Why are these companies legal?

Because they provide a service that fills a demand i.e. short term borrowing for people who cannot use a credit card. Banning the lenders doesn't make the demand magically disappear. Just like when America tried banning alcohol, the supply will filled by the only other people who can: organised crime (in this case, loan sharks).

The thing is, you're referring to the APR when talking about a payday lender's rates. You will, from your professional experience, know what the A stands for (for those who don't, it stands for *annual*) so you must surely realise the error of using a measurement designed for a loan taken for the minimum of a year, and applying it to a loan of a couple of weeks? The short timescale wildly distorts the APR, making it useless when comparing the real-time cost of a loan.

Let me give you an example:

A mate wants to borrow £20 to tide him over for a week. You lend it to him, because you're nice like that. A week later, he pays you back, and buys you a pint to say thanks. Everyone's happy.

Now, let's say that pint was £3. Does that sound fair to you? £3 ""interest"" on a £20 loan for a week? It sure sounds fair to me.

But what's the APR on that deal?

it's circa 770% APR. Ooh, suddenly you're a rip-off merchant whose ripping off your mate with an eye-watering APR..... but it's still only £3 on £20 over a week.

This is because you're using a measurement designed to cover *at least* a year against a loan of a week.

Absolutely they should be regulated to ensure that people cannot get caught in an ever-escalating pile of debt, but the anger at the APR is completely misplaced, and draws attention away from where it needs to be.",0,1400608940,null,0,false,0,chmsvbp,t3_25z4vz,t1_chmsvbp,t1_chmk83v,null,1433880128,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

A points based immigration system combined with criminal record checks would result in far fewer foreign criminals coming here, yes. That's just common sense.

&gt;As I said, I support a more integrated Europe. A Europe where it is easier to move funds and other support to places where they are needed. That's what cooperation is.

So what you're really saying is that you want a total European government that takes money from the UK and gives it to Romania.

&gt;Being ideological, I support government run businesses, so you could essentially have the government (in this case a Europe wide one) setting up businesses in those countries for the good of the people. Being a bit more realistic, stuff like tax breaks.

A European wide government, setting up businesses? Good God. How is sixth form politics A level going for you?

What makes you think that a European wide government would be sensible enough to set up innovative businesses and somehow use these to benefit the people?

Almost every government on Earth is corrupt, some more than others obviously, but you find me a government that doesn't fuck over its citizens in some way or another and I'd be astonished, because there isn't one.

God knows why you would want to give people this much power.

Do you want to live in a totalitarian dictatorship? Because that is how you get one. 

&gt;As opposed to the always concise and never misleading UKIP?

UKIP's proposal:

A points based immigration system so that we prioritize skilled workers and bring net migration down to 30/50,000 from its current rate of 220,000

Your proposal:

Set up a total European government, abolish the nation states, and then put the government in charge of setting up business, and this will magically fix all poverty and crime

&gt; I support reform, to make the EU more federal, and if we can't achieve that, and the EU goes too far in the direction of opposing the well being of the people (such as supporting the Trans-Atlantic Trade Deal), I would support us leaving.

A second ago you were saying that you want a total European wide government that sets up businesses and is in charge of taking funds away from the UK and giving them to Romania.

Good luck reforming the EU btw. All of the leaders have basically come out and said that there is 0% chance of any meaningful renegotiation. They're fanatics that endlessly talk, like you, of further integration and further concentration of power.

true,TychoBraheNose,eu,London (UCL),"&gt;Sites for sharing illegal content have already been blocked by the courts, not through the filter, so not sure how ""the debate"" was bypassed? It's quite clearly illegal to share music/films etc and I'm not sure how people can complain about an optional filter to stop kids accessing illegal content blocks them from accessing illegal content?

Not all filesharing is illegal, though, and this blocks indiscriminately. Not all music and films shared are in breach of copyright, sure, if it is owned by Universal of Sony then it probably is, but a lot of artists use filesharing to spread their stuff around to save on hosting costs. A lot of content also isn't copyrighted anymore, like most classical pieces of literature. That is of course only one example, but the point wasn't really the content anyways. Cameron and the Tories have pretty much completely neglected to mention *anything* except porn being blocked, when that is not what they are doing at all. Along with the porn is going anything the Tories consider 'tasteless', the deceit and lack of transparency with which this is being implemented is cause for concern, regardless of anything else.   

&gt;There will always be a few false positives, 

We're talking about the entire Internet. If you think it is ever possible to come close to having accurate and appropriate filtering across the entire Internet, you are insane. There are no algorithms that come close, they are the reason for the fuck ups so far, and there is no way you could justify the cost of a huge-ass team to go through website-by-website (which would near impossible anyways, you would need an insane percentage of the countries population employed to manage it) with so many cuts to public spending in more important areas. That would not represent value for money. 

&gt;especially to begin with. How many legitimate sites are still blocked? If you still want to have access to those categories you can choose them[1]  
Or, you could just turn the filter off if you don't like it. Talking about poor and old people as if they are fucking idiots doesn't help anyone. When they sign up to a new internet service, they are told they are getting this. If they don't want it they can choose not to. If they don't opt out, and they want to access a site that is blocked it tells them it's blocked and how to get it unblocked.

Yes, **you** can turn off your filter, but what about everyone living in someone else's house? I'm not talking about 30-something year old men who want to look at porn, I'm talking about a 15 or 16 year old child who is bullied who doesn't feel like they can talk to their parents about it. If charities designed to help in these situations are blocked, what are they going to do? The government doesn't say anything about what websites are blocked, or on what grounds, so the only way you could know if a website is blocked is when you try and access it. If this hypothetical child doesn't want to talk to their parents about something, they are unlikely to ask if their parents can remove the 'porn filter' so they can access a charity's website about substance abuse, self-harm, or bullying. 

**This is why we need transparency with the implementation of the filters**. If these filters are in any way about protecting young people, then **everything** needs to be done to help them with potential problems. Similarly, what about a couple with domestic abuse problems? How exactly are you supposed to tell your abusive partner to remove the filter so that they can access the relevant services? 

You are only looking at this from your own perspective, and clearly you cannot relate to the people these problems could affect. That does not mean they don't exist because they don't apply to you. 

&gt;Yes the internet blocking is futile, but it's not the end of the country as we know it - just show you don't agree with it by not using it.

Absolutely not. I'm not saying it is what to come, but this is exactly what started in Iran. In order to protect women and children, pornography was filtered online, quickly followed by 'tasteless' content - a list that carried on growing. Cameron and the Tories refuse to have any public oversight or transparency as to what they are doing, and despite promises that it was only for porn they are using it to impose their morals and values on everyone.

I am not going to just ""not use it"" because I morally oppose with what the government are doing. Neither would I turn a blind eye to issues regarding net neutrality or freedom of speech, of which both are relevant to Cameron's porn filter.

I wrote a more comprehensive comment earlier, touching on that point:

&gt;The ISPs have very little say about what kind of content gets blocked, as Cory Doctorow stated in the Guardian in January: 
&gt;
&gt;""last summer, David Cameron and the DCMS *mandated* that ISPs would *have to* switch on their customers' content filters (*to block everything from ""extremism"" to ""esoteric content""*) by default, and only deactivate them if the customer rang up and demanded it.""
&gt;
&gt;Only Cameron and the relevant Tories know what 'extremist' and 'esoteric' content is. Whilst each ISP will have its own list of blocked websites, they don't have any say in what categories of content get blocked.
&gt;
&gt;""Cameron said ISPs should choose their own preferred technical solution, but would be monitored to ensure filtering was done correctly.""
&gt;
&gt;This is also all missing the biggest points, however, the filters are nothing more than pandering to worried parents, and have no empirical reasoning behind them. There has never been a large-scale filtering of the Internet that made any significant difference to the wide-spread access to blocked content, no attempts have ever even come close. The language Cameron uses about the filters is so vacuous and overly emotional, for instance,
&gt;
&gt;""But when it comes to internet pornography, parents have been left too much on their own. And I’m determined to put that right... no more hassle of downloading filters for every device, just one click protection. One click to protect your whole home and to keep your children safe.""
&gt;
&gt;Protect your home? Keep your children safe? We're talking about porn filters (and extremism, et al.) that a child could literally circumnavigate. This is Cameron and the Tories pushing their morals and values on everyone, without any transparency with what they are doing or what they are blocking.",0,1400609424,null,0,1400609650,0,chmt3mh,t3_25zkbh,t1_chmt3mh,t1_chmrfho,null,1433880237,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,alysdexia,null,null,"&gt;For starters: you're being incredibly pedantic about something that doesn't matter in the slightest. Also, you're not even correct. ""what the hell"" is the more commonly used expression, but they're interchangeable. In any case, ""what in hell"" hardly makes any sense either. Moving on,

Meaning matters; meaning makes sense.  What is common is not correct; what is meaningful and accurate is correct.  Maybe you take bad as good, stupid as fine, and nice as well also.

&gt;That's still nothing to do with nepotism. Nepotism means someone powerful favoring their family and friends. I'm saying that I disagree with the countries that allow drawn child porn, and my decision won't be influenced by them.

No it doesn't.  You don't need power; again you rely on your own interpretation of words instead of what the coiner meant.  You care whether *only* your own country allows it.  That's what you said, and that you object to other countries' policy is secondary to that.

&gt;Dude, it's been proven that most children have a lower mental capacity than most adults. It's obvious to anyone with a thread of common sense anyway. Not all, I'll grant you, but by and large kids can't handle things in the way adults can.

I'm not a funny dresser.  Also, all adults are children so your statement can be forgotten.  But that's not what you were asked, and your admitted exclusion disqualifies age.  What is the objective standard for mental capacity?

&gt;Learning and IQ have no bearing on the maturity of a child to deal with this sort of situation. Like it or not, they're still children. Their brains are still growing. Do you think it is OK to have sex with children too, as long as they have an IQ over 130?

Maturity is not a virtue, and it has nothing to do with mental capacity or ability.  Maturity is a set of bodily (also mindly) processes determined by genes and hormones, themselves determined by evolution, that take someone throuh life that usually includes breeding and ultimately ends in skilful and healthful decay till death; the purpose of maturity is to carry on a species, and the death stage is to keep resources for further generations.  It is simply how things are but does not mean how things ouht be nor how things can best be.  This aspect of evolution is blind, has no foresiht.  When language is emergent, bearers can determine and decide their own goals, such as to bypass this maturity that ends in eldness and failure.

Learning and cleverness are the very things needed to handle anything.  Brains do not ever stop growing: http://google.com/search?q=alysdexia+Giedd.  A brain that is more grown at age is at a disadvantage than one not, and has a lower IQ.  Brain growth makes one more decisive, not more correct.  Grown brains lose plasticity, cannot learn new tasks or facts as easily, and are stubborn to unlearn societal brainwash.

I said nothing about incest.

&gt;Of course you did. Why am I not surprised... Are you /u/DarqWolff 's alt?

This is my only ekename, after lysdexia is often taken.  My profile is on Twitter and a list of where I'v been is on Quora.  I'm not a regular redditor.

&gt;Also: It's my turn to be a pedantic arsewipe. That's ""18 year olds"", not the nonsensical ""18 yeareds""

You're wrong.  The ""old"" is itself a misnomer, opposite of ""new"", where ""eld"" is to ""young""; even so, the attribute is redundant and often absent in other compounds: 5-foot; 10-second.  (These were adjectives and therefore hadn't the perfective enclitic in my substantive.)

&gt;Sick burn bro! /s

I'm not a bro either.

&gt;No, I can't treat this as intellectual property because it's CHILD PORN, which is a completely different thing, like it or not. It affects people in a completely different way. I'm not even going to respond to your accusation of ""misrepresenting and libeling"" children.

That doesn't follow; that is no argument; you don't talk for everyone (especially not the subjects).  I did not say anything about children.  Learn how to read.

&gt;Seriously? If I didn't care about children I'd let pedos wank over them all day. Of course I fucking care about children. I know how children deal with problems they don't understand because I've been a child myself.

You'd let kids wank over them? Wherefore?  Everyone's been a child--so what?  Everyone who isn't a clone or robot is a child still.  You are still one person and can't frame your mind in other than your own wonts and biases.

&gt;You're just being a dick. Language evolves.

No, still a pedant.  Language decays.  Words are coined by a few then the fele trample over their senses.  It takes literature to keep and represent their meaning.  The Dark Ages of the 800s and 900s let Englisc and English go to hell for Norman, then Einglish, then Standard.  This is why you believe in absurdities and cannot tell you believe in them.

&gt;Does it matter, they both mean the same thing in English.
&gt;You're just being a dick, child can mean ""someone who's not yet an adult"" too.

I do not condemn a whole swath of the world for a kind of lust and love.  I do not believe I can be a dick when I care about what words mean, especially when they determine social and legal outlook.  Two words cannot mean the same thing; that's why they are **two words**.  A child is someone who has left the womb; yester that is a brood (fetus).  The opposite of child is parent (or bear/er); this board software agrees with me: child comments; parent comment.

&gt;Filo can also mean ""lover""

Professionals such as scientists and jurists are not lingvists.  They steal words without respect to meaning.  They know fewer words than are in the native inventory; therefore the few words they use sadly improperly overlap in meaning.  Filo only means friend; its other inflections mean kiss.  Erastès means lover and eros means love; its verbal inflection also means love.  (Agapè means like.)

&gt;Right, let's straighten something out here. We speak modern English. We don't speak Latin, or Greek, or Middle English. ANYONE who uses the word ""pedophile"" means someone who is sexually attracted to children. Therefore, that's what the word means. Full stop. Your fucking etymology nonsense and lingual gymnastics is totally beside the point. You knew exactly what I meant, and calling me out on something that I didn't even do wrong is simply being a dick.

One can't speak on a keyboard; one talks.  English is long dead; ye use Latinate and Hellènic loanwords which are not English.  A *word* means what it says.  A *person* means what one minds.  You are a nonsensical dick when you abuse and pervert words so that they are no longer literal.  When you do this, you can take a word to mean two opposite things or two opposite words to mean one identical thing.  You cannot respect referends unless you respect and tell terms.  You like to throw out names at someone you don't even know--three in one comment--especially when you don't like to examine them and yourself; you do whatever your kith do.",0,1400610089,null,0,false,0,chmtfap,t3_25n96t,t1_chmtfap,t1_chlyco1,null,1433880390,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I look forward to his argument as to how they were justified then, until then the presumption on my part is that they were not, just as they would be for any civilian. Authority and force are not self-justifying.

And in your second paragraph you say ""however the actions were justified"" and ""there was no way of predicting that it would result in a fatality.""

A) We have no proof as yet that his actions were justified

B) Manslaughter generally doesn't involve knowledge that the action could lead to death. The rules don't suddenly change when the person puts a badge on.

&gt;Even if this could be classed as manslaughter, why would you prosecute? 

The police are as responsible for the consequences of their actions as civilians are and a badge and a wage does not diminish it. There is only one system of law and we are all equal before it.

He could very well be to a degree responsible for the death of this man, so I hope he comes forward and explains why he believes his actions were justified, because I think justice for this man's death demand it.

true,bcash,null,null,"Buy-to-let is an investment, if pays a decent return on investment.  At current house prices and rental prices, any new landlords will be seeing tiny ROI - certainly not enough to cover any borrowing they may have needed.

Buy-to-let is speculation if it is expected to provide benefit by capital gain alone, at some point down the line.  This is what most people who become landlords in 2014 are expecting.  And, let me make it clear, speculation is not wrong, we would have a much poorer economy without it.

However, there are many downward facing pressures to make note of; including, but not limited to, and in no particular order:

1. Future interest rates - the ROI of current and future landlords will be low and getting lower (potentially much, much lower) in future.

2.  The feedback loop - if buy-to-let is a significant part of the market, it therefore will be the cause of much of the capital gains the previous generation of buy-to-let landlords are relying on.  At some point it'll stop making sense (I'd argue we're already here, but it'll take the majority of others to see it for it to happen), and when it stops making sense there'll be a lot of people with a lot of expensive assets that are costing them a fortune to keep running.

3.  The number of unknown ""accidental landlords.""  These people are trying to time their exit from the market, and is one of the reason the number of sales is so low at the moment.  They're not hanging-on forever like Buy-to-Letters, they'll go to market at the first sniff of both: a) the market slowing down, and b) a healthy profit.

Two further comments:

1.  Yes, this means any future house price correction will see a drastic reduction of rental properties available. No-one is going to have any fun when it happens.  Landlords capable of hanging on might stand to make some money, but these will be those who have the best finances to withstand any interest rate rises.  If you own property with no mortgage you might be set!

2.  None of the above is likely to happen soon (i.e. this year).  Next year it might, who knows?",0,1400611234,null,0,false,0,chmtzoh,t3_260svb,t1_chmtzoh,t1_chmo3sj,null,1433880656,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3
true,emorrp1,null,null,"The important figure when looking at the ""burden"" of student debt isn't the amount you owe SFE, because as you rightly calculate most people won't pay off the capital, but the rate at which it is reclaimed from you via PAYE. This is what I liked about the £3k system as it's as close to a graduate tax as you can reasonably expect - you want to go to university, you will pay 9% of your salary (above a threshold) for a few decades. Those who benefit most financially from their degree will pay the most back, those who still earn below average will have a free education (especially when you include maintenance loans).

Now what most people don't realise about the government economics of the rise to £9k are that this difference is largely made up of a massive decrease in higher education HEFCE grants (c. £5k per student) and increased bursaries from the University to disadvantages students. So what was previously just granted from the government to the university is now loaned from the government to the student, who pays the university. This means that the government can assume a ridiculously low repayment rate, since now they're getting some money back, compared to none.

It is also more progressive, since truly high flyers will pay back a larger total sum than they did under the old system, so the remaining sticking point is that University used to be practically free, so the majority of voters are asking the younger ones to pay something that they never had to - unfortunately this is a consequence of change and the new system could be much worse than it is.",0,1400611243,null,0,false,0,chmtzuj,t3_260zyn,t1_chmtzuj,t3_260zyn,null,1433880661,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

I'd invest at least 5 million in properties in different cities worldwide. Typicall rental gets you between 5-10% of the value a year back, so that should give me at worst case 250k a year in income. 


That then gives me enough that I can basically travel when/where I want in luxury.


Family wouldnt be allowed any lump sums but an income of at least 5k a month each for them. that would set me back another 4-5 million , either in property or investments.


I'd have to have a company and someone looking after all the above for me, but even at 100k/year running costs that's fine. I'd also need a lawyer on retainer because rich people get sued a lot. 


So we have 14 million left. At least 10 of that would be used to buy me houses in various locations. Croatia, somewhere in the Canadian wilderness, maybe a place in Switzerland are the ones that immediately come to mind. I'd have them fully equipped and maintained but only use each one a few months of the year. 


The canadian one would probably be some kind of extravagent wood/stone cabin type thing, there'd be running water nearby providing water/electricity to the house, as well as solar and a reserve diesel generator. It would have stunning views, a heated pool and jacuzzi looking out across the hills, and some kind of night vision and motion sensors sytems so i could know when wildlife was nearby. There'd be a nice wood burner and a big open rooms with no walls on one side sort of half exposed, but with plenty of fires to provide warmth and light.


now, cars. I'd need at least two [audi r8s](http://15pictures.com/wp-content/gallery/15-pictures-audi-r8/audi-r8-1.jpg) - one spare. These would be for europe though, since i figure in the canadian wildness i probably couldnt drive that. For that i'd probably be sadly forced to buy some giant ghastly american 4 by 4 thing just to get around, which is annoying. 


all of my houses would have many of the latest computers - both macs (mac pros &lt;3) , the lastest 27"" imacs and at least 30TB of local storage in each location. There'd be insanely faster internets and private links between all my houses so that my files were all in sync whichever house i was in. Each house would have at least two [1dx](http://www.canon.co.uk/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_SLR/EOS_1Dx/) camera bodies, plus a good 30k+ in lenses for when i felt like photograping. I'd have some smaller [sony rx100 IIIs](http://www.ephotozine.com/article/sony-rx100-iii-20-1-megapixel-camera-announced-25487) as my travel cameras as well as a few top end macbook pros as well.

My routine depends on what job I'm working in at any given time. A surgical start can be as early as 07:45 but most medical jobs tend to start at 09:00. Parking isn't available for staff in the vast majority of Edinburgh hospitals so you I either get public transport or cycle. I'm considering getting an electric bike to help with the uphills because Edinburgh is very hilly. It's also really important to have good bike lights because it isn't unusual for the weather to be so overcast/foggy that even the cars drive with their lights on.

Work is busy. The NHS is strapped for cash and thus staff the wards at the absolute bare minimum they can get away with. It's barely adequate on a good day and a disaster if anyone is sick/the rota is unfilled for whatever reason. There's a enormous lack of availability of carers in the community which means patients can't be safely sent home from hospital so they stay and block beds. A hospital bed costing £400/night is wasted on somebody awaiting care costing &lt;£100/day. It isn't fair on the patients: both those who just want to go home and those who need their beds. But on the whole the patients are lovely and occasionally I make a diagnosis that makes a difference to their quality of life, so I've got that going for me which is nice.


I pack my own lunch that I eat whilst working. We're lucky enough to have two Waitroses here and their deli section is really good. You see haggis and black pudding as a staple in a Scottish supermarket shelf as opposed to elsewhere.


One of the best things about Edinburgh is its beautiful architecture: the Georgian and Victorian stuff especially. It's perfectly normal to have a flat in Edinburgh with beautiful, high ceilings, a bit of cornicing and really good proportions. People in Edinburgh often say that it's expensive to live here but having lived across the UK, the value for money you get here is second to none. It's a pleasure to live in a city with culture, restaurants, architecture, history and character. One of the best thing about it is the proximity of nature: There are lots of green spaces in the heart of the city centre, there's even a national park (Holyrood) within walking distance, the sea is a bus ride away and if you have a car an hours drive will take you to astonishing beaches. There's woodland in the Hermitage of Braid, an even bigger national park in the Pentlands (complete with winter sport centre) and a river (Water of Leith) running through the heart of it. 

I've always found Scottish people to be very friendly and I think it's marvellous how they have such a strong sense of national identity and culture. Up here, I think more people see themselves as Scottish rather than British and it will be interesting to see how the referendum turns out. Personally, I worry that independence would devastate the Scottish economy but we'll see. 


So basically, I think Edinburgh's the best city in Europe but then again I am rather biased.

true,tjcefc,null,null,"Im gonna mention the two lads who are currently playing for England U17s atm and who subsequently didnt play in either the semi-final or final for the U18s.



Okay so firstly I will start with the player who’s had the most coverage due to his couple of appearances on the bench for the first team – Ryan Ledson. He won the ‘Academy player of the season’ award at the recent awards ceremony and this would obviously suggest he has had a wonderful season and has progressed a lot this season. I’ve seen him play a few times and he has certainly impressed. I would describe him as a typical ‘modern’ midfielder if you will. By that I specifically mean he is very good all round. He can tackle, he can pass and he has an eye for goal. The modern game demands midfielders who have multiple attribute rather than those who specialize  solely in tackling or passing for example.  His long range passing appears to be his main strength (based on what I have seen) but his ability to cover ground also impressed me a lot. Also, apparently Ledson has an unbelievable attitude and work ethic. He seems like a VERY grounded individual (much like Barkley) which of course bodes well. 



Next is Jonjoe Kenny (CB/RB/LB). Like Ledson, Kenny is also currently representing England in the U17 European championship (England are through to the final which is tomorrow in case anybody is interested). He has mainly been playing right-back (and occasionally left-back) for England. However, whenever I have seen him play for the U18s he has been playing centre-back. This kid is seriously, seriously good. I would go as far to say he has looked better than Ledson whenever I have seen them play (not taking anything away from Ledson here at all). His technique, touch and distribution are nothing short of outstanding. The only issue with regards to him as a CB is his height. He is relatively short (probably only around 5’9). Of course, he is only 17 and so he could certainly grow a few more inches. If he reaches 6ft I would be amazed if we didn’t see him playing centre-back alongside John Stones one day – he is that good. However, even if he doesn’t grow much he could maybe still play CB and if not, certainly full-back (or even defensive-mid). I watched him play full-back for England over the weekend and he was superb. Wonderful composure on the ball and he is as solid as a rock defensively. When I first watched the U18s (back in December I think) he was the best player on the pitch by a comfortable margin in my opinion. He outshone everybody including Ledson. Barring a tragedy, this kid WILL play for the Everton first team; you can quote me on that.



There is also a lad from the U18s called Joe Williams (CM/CDM). He is a holding midfielder who was outstanding in the final against Man City. When I first saw him play earlier this season he really didn’t stand out much. He didn’t look bad by any means but he didn’t look great either. It would appear this lad has improved a hell of a lot throughout the season. He won ‘U18 player of the season’ and you could see why against both Spurs and especially City. The lad reads the game very well, is extremely strong in the tackle and also has an eye for a pass. In fact, his long range passing is what impressed me most against City. He was spraying some 40yard wonderballs and he just generally impressed me a lot. It is of course impossibly difficult to know whether he will continue to improve at the rate he has done but he certainly has something about him; only time will tell whether he is good enough for the highest level.  



A few other lads from the U18s:   Harry Charsley (CM/CAM) – he scored the winner in the final and looks a very talented lad. Apparently towards the end of this season he spent some time training with the first team which indicates he has a lot of talent. He is an attacking-mid with a wonderful touch and great awareness. He’s one of these players who has a great appreciation of space which is always an attribute I look out for with youngsters because only the best players have it. He has quick feet and very good close control. Definitely one to keep an eye on. 

Michael Donoghue (RM/LM) – scored the winner against spurs with a great run and finish. This lad is only 15 I think but has played quite a few times for the U18s. Very quick and also very skillful. This lad has bags of potential but at his age it just depends how he develops. Another one to keep a close eye on. 

Tom Davies (CM) – also only 15/16 y.o but has played a few times for the U18s. Combative CM with great energy , a good touch and a decent passing range. Looks a good all-round player and considering he was giving up three years on some of the other lads, he certainly  didn’t look out of place against City. 

Russel Griffiths (GK) – looks a real talent. Exceptional distribution and passing for a keeper. Also a good-shot stopper who commands his area well. He was my MOTM in the final against City and he could definitely make it at a high level based on what I have seen. He looks really, really promising. 

Then there’s another couple of lads from the U16s who were on the bench against City who are highly regarded within the club. 

Liam Walsh (CM) – haven’t seen him play but he is meant to be quality. Ross Barkley tweeted about him recently actually

Kieran Dowell (midfielder – not 100% sure where he plays but I think he is a CM). I think we will be hearing about these two quite a bit over the coming years so keep an eye out for them too. 

To be perfectly honest, all the lads from the U18s impressed me in the semi-finals and the final. I just picked some of the most impressive ones in the interest of time.

There isn't one. However, it's 100% true that *by and large*, **CHILDREN** (you know fine what I mean) are less capable of handling mature situations than **ADULTS** (don't you even fucking *think* about giving me your ""adults are children"" bollocks again).

&gt; I said nothing about incest.

I didn't say ""have sex with your *own* children"", idiot. Another example of you ignoring and twisting the clear meaning of my words.

&gt;You're wrong. The ""old"" is itself a misnomer

Every sane person who speaks the English language calls people ""x year olds"". If you're the only one who's saying it ""correctly"", you're wrong. LANGUAGE FUCKING EVOLVES.

&gt;You'd let kids wank over them

... pedo is the shortened form of pedophile. you know exactly what I meant, as would anyone else in the english speaking world.

&gt;Everyone who isn't a clone or robot is a child still.

... *sigh*

&gt;Language decays

That's condescending as fuck. You're denying that the world has progressed since these words were first introduced. Anyway, decay is still a form of evolution. The language is changing over time. As I've said before, if you're the only one who's still using the word 'pedo', 'child' or whatever ""correctly"", YOU'RE WRONG. Could you imagine looking at a park and saying to someone ""look at the pedos playing in the park""? They wouldn't understand what the fuck you're on about. In Ancient Greece they would, but WE DON'T LIVE IN ANCIENT FUCKING GREECE.

&gt; they determine social and legal outlook

No, they don't. A pedophile, by any other name, would still be looked on with disgust from society.

&gt; Two words cannot mean the same thing; that's why they are two words

A word can have multiple meanings. ""Tablet"" can refer to a pill, to a slab of stone for writing on, or to a type of computer. ""Light"" can refer to what comes out of a lightbulb, or it can mean the opposite of heavy, or it can mean to set something on fire. By the same token, ""child"" can mean someone who's born of a parent, or it can mean someone regarded as ""underage"". **HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES.**

&gt;The opposite of child is parent

Yes, but the opposite of child is also adult. Source: EVERY FUCKING THESAURUS EVER.

&gt;The board software agrees

No, the board software is using ""child"" in the context ""born of a parent"". It's saying nothing about whether ""child"" can also mean ""not an adult"".

&gt;One can't speak on a keyboard; one talks.

One can perfectly well speak to a keyboard, it's just that one would look like a complete fucking goon doing so. Also, again, *you knew what I meant*. Stop being a pedantic cunt.

&gt;English is long dead; ye use Latinate and Hellènic loanwords which are not English.

Yes, they are. They have become part of English. We speak English, source: EVERY SANE PERSON IN THE ENTIRE FUCKING ENGLISH SPEAKING WORLD.

&gt; You are a nonsensical dick when you abuse and pervert words so that they are no longer literal.

It's you who's nonsensical. Nobody exclusively uses the historic literal meaning of words. If I'm being nonsensical, **so is EVERYONE ELSE**. And again, if you're the only ""sensical"" person to the point where you deny understanding what everyone else is saying despite the fact you understand fine, it's *you* who's the idiot.

If you bought a car for £50,000, that's your choice, if you can afford it, it's good.  But if you bought a car for £50,000 then rented out in long-term rentals of one year each for £1,500 per year, you'd ask yourself some difficult questions.

Ah, but what if you could sell that car for £100,000 after a few years, I hear you ask?  Well, yes, that changes everything.  But what if the people paying £100,000 would only go and continue to rent it out at £1,750 (inflation in the meantime), you'd see you were on a nonsensical conveyor belt of insanity.

* Taxes here (as a renter) are nuts compared to Ontario. Be prepared for this. My council tax in Hammersmith/fulham and TV tax alone come out to over 140 per month.

You can't expect to play with no true defensive midfielder and a generally somewhat soft (but skilled) midfield and not give up goals.  

We also played the diamond a lot which meant we sacrificed a lot of width which I wouldn't be surprised to find meant more crosses for Sktrl to clear; which he does excellently and with conviction unlike Agger or Sakho.

&gt; There is ever growing demand, fueled by foreign investment, speculative investment and government subsidising of risky debt (help-to-buy)

There's nothing ""ever growing"" about any of that.  Foreign investment is fickle, it could stop or reverse as soon as something more interesting comes along.  Speculation, almost by definition, has no permanent effect on a market, rather it is people trying to move ahead of the curve - either the bet pays off or it doesn't.  And well, yes, the government subsidy; it's amazing how many people are completely unaware of the countless billions of public money currently promised to underwrite the housing market.

&gt; This is worst case scenario type stuff, but it's enough to make the BoE and the FCA come out publicly as saying they have their eye on it and are considering intervention in the housing market.

The UK economy as a whole is pretty much royally fucked over this issue.  Consumer spending is a big part of the economy, the Bank of England knows this, any fall in house prices would cause a recession.  And any recession would stop, or indeed reverse the case for raising interest rates.

But, by failing to raise interest rates bubbles like this keep forming.  And when they do form household debt goes up, which makes the economy more intolerant of rate rises.

Now, where it really gets interesting is how this will play out.  Politically the majority of the population still live in owner-occupied dwellings, so you can be sure the government will try and maintain the myth of everything being OK for ""hardworkingfamilies"".  However, because the economy has been painted into this corner, they might not be able to do anything about it.

Especially if world-wide interest rates rise, this would put significant pressure on Sterling; increase inflation, destabilise the financial sector, make pensioners angry, etc.  This plus the ever increasing numbers of people ""priced out"" means the day when the majority of voters explicitly want policies that decrease house prices isn't really that far away...

Anyone who's: a) got a good degree, b) doesn't own a house, and c) has a lot of student debt.  What's stopping you skipping the country entirely?  You'll be massively better off, in practically every way.

**My understanding, (feel free to correct it)** is that they oppose building new Nuclear Power Stations, and want to tighten standards on existing ones. I see nothing about closing down existing power stations.

* A quick google search tells me it takes between 6-8 years to build a new Nuclear PS (not counting planning, securing finance and licensing), the Greens argue that by the time any are completed, we wont need them.

No one except you is interested in tax free allowance, we are talking about real tax avoidance. 

If you receive a salary, it is pretty much unavoidable to pay your tax. If you are very rich and can afford to buy into a scheme, or employ someone to do it for you, you can utilise tax havens and other legal but morally dubious methods to avoid paying tax. Do you think the income distribution of people who use tax havens is the same as the general income distribution of the population? The mean income in the UK is £26,500, do you think the mean income of people using schemes like Jimmy Carr did is more than £26,500 or not? 

I like Jimmy Carr, but he was only paying **1%** effective rate on his income (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18537051), and he was not breaking the law. That is tax avoidance.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"Well, I think that is quite a short sighted view. I assume you're referring to the EU.

There is a significant amount of investment that comes into the UK that we compete for against other European countries, from places like India, China, Japan etc. If we leave the EU and stop the 'mass immigration', companies will reduce investment in the UK because it makes doing business with other European countries more difficult. Europe is seen as a region, and global companies like to have regional headquarters and tend to move employees around a lot when working on contracts in other parts of the region. If we leave the EU, we're excluding ourselves from these decisions.

Just one example of how leaving the EU could affect business in the UK: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/10434906/Nissan-We-may-quit-Britain-if-it-leaves-EU.html Nissan are one of the largest employers in the North East, with a significant number of jobs in it's supply chain. If we leave the EU and they move the production of a single model to somewhere like Germany, it could cost the region tens of thousands of skilled jobs, and for what? Because some people hold the incorrect assumption that immigrants are the sole cause of unemployment?

I also strongly disagree with your assumption that the reason I have been unsuccessful is because of immigration. A few of the opportunities I narrowly missed out on, I knew the guys who got it either through university or through networking, and they were all born and raised in the UK. There is also a big push to ensure any applicants are elligible to work in the UK (They often ask to see basic identity documents in face to face interviews). But that is completely immaterial. What matters is the skills of the applicants, and we have a top notch education system in the UK so the chances of a UK applicant coming out on top is quite high. If an immigrant who had the disadvantage of being a non-native speaker was hired over me, it means they were a better candidate than me, full stop. I couldn't care less if they're from Birmingham, Bulgaria, Bangladesh or Botswana. If you force British businesses to pick inferior candidates based solely on race, you're hurting British businesses and being extremely racist at the same time.

He has a great understanding of the game for a young player.  Brendan is the only manager in England with the nerve to take such a young, pacey player off the wing and putting them under strikers.  Sterling still gets to run on the counter, but when there are men behind the ball his pace is mostly sacrificed playing in the diamond.

From what I've seen of Ibe, there's almost no chance of something similar happening.  He'll likely stay on the wing and his ability to shoot will work well with the fullback width we see currently.

I don't think they'll be used interchangeably at all: Sterling has solidified his place and Ibe will be fighting to get some matches at the expense of Coutinho (likely away from home, particularly in domestic cups) or Henderson, who seems to be pushed out wider because of his workrate, plus whatever out-and-out winger is inevitably signed.",0,1400616802,null,0,false,0,chmwr3r,t3_25xw6h,t1_chmwr3r,t1_chlxcc4,null,1433881958,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

The inclusion of Capaldi in the 13 just kept the idea of him being the final Doctor in play a bit longer. A bit of misdirection for the fans. However, as someone best explained already, the Time Lords wouldn't have thought anything of it. 13 Doctors, all regenerations accounted for.

oh and then some of the chemicals used just some because the list id very long;

    Proppants, also known as “props”, are chemicals that open the fractures and then allow the fluids or gases to flow in a freer way to the wellbore. Sand, including zirconium oxide and sintered bauxite, is used to keep fractures open, so that the gas or oil can be extracted. Ceramic beads are also a part of this mixture.
    Acid is used in cleaning intervals of drilling mud and cement before the fluids are injected. Hydrochloric acid HCL, also known as muriatic acid, is used in this process. Breaker chemicals, like Peroxydisulfates, reduce fluid viscosity so that proppants can be released into fractures. They also enhance the fracturing fluid recovery.
    Bactericides and Biocides including Gluteraldehyde inhibit the growth of certain organisms that might otherwise produce gases that could contaminate the methane gas. These also prevent bacteria growth which could reduce the fluid’s ability to carry the proppant into new fractures.
    Buffers, or pH adjusting agents, like potassium carbonate or sodium carbonate and acetic acid are able to adjust and control the pH levels of the fluid so that other additives will work properly.




    Clay controls or stabilizers, including potassium chloride and tetramethyl ammonium chloride prevent the migration and swelling of formation clays, so that they do not block pore spaces. Otherwise, they might reduce the permeability of the shale.
    Corrosion inhibitors like ammonium bisulfate and methanol help to reduce the growth of rust on the steel tubing, tanks, tools and well casings.
    Friction reducers including petroleum distillates and sodium acrylate-acrylamide copolymer allow the fluids used in fracking to be injected at the best possible rates, by lowering the amount of friction between the fluids and the piping.
    Iron control chemicals like polyacrylate, ethylene glycol and Ammonium chloride prevent any precipitation of sulfates and carbonites, so that they can’t plug off the shale formation.
    Surfactants like ethoxylated alcohol, isopropanol and methanol reduce the tension in the surface of the fracturing fluids, to aid in the recovery of the fluid.

    Some of the chemicals used in fracking are toxic to the environment, as well as to humans and to wildlife. Some may cause cancer. The substances that are potentially damaging can contaminate water in the areas around the fracking wells.

""...tax avoidance which is technically legal but not for a business purpose or in violation of the spirit of the tax code.""

Nobody will be in the newspapers for using their tax free allowance (in fact I'm not sure the government would accept it, you aren't meant to pay it), or for using an ISA. ISAs are marketed to the general population in good faith.

Using the more morally questionable methods does attract attention, as they seriously affect the amount of tax you are paying and they are not available to everyone. If you are earning, for sake of argument, £30,000 a year, no ISA allows you to pay in enough so that you are essentially only paying 1% in tax.

The most recent tax avoidance scandal, Icebreaker, involving Gary Barlow, Gabby Logan, and Colin Jackson amongst many others, managed to reduce the tax bill of the few hundred people involved by £336m by claiming to be getting new music acts a break. A group of tax avoiders would set up a company, invest money, and then automatically report huge loses that are offset against your tax. There were no new music acts. This is genuine deceit, albeit not illegal, whereas an ISA is exactly what it says it it and available to everyone. Again, if everyone had an ISA, things would carry on running, if everyone was only paying 1% tax, then the country would grind to a halt. 

I'm sure if you carried on suggesting things we would inevitably find a grey area, it is a moral spectrum after all. But you cannot compare tax free allowances and ISAs to schemes like Icebreaker or tax havens, and label them all as tax avoidance. 

EDIT/Correction: Apparently there were *some* artists with Icebreaker, but it is entirely designed as a tax avoidance scheme. Look at the website design, it says 'business' not 'artists'. Google's description is 'An exciting opportunity to make money from know how and creative material. Investors may also be eligible for certain tax reliefs.' And they have a team of advisors to help you set up an LLP (Limited Liability Partership) to avoid tax.

true,Clackpot,,"The tears of a clown, no ice","Which one of our own cultures?

I'm going to try to avoid the kneejerk snide remarks which I confess I feel you deserve, so hear me out please.

Which one of our cultures? The Angles from modern day Shleswig-holstein? The Saxons of Saxony? The Picts who colonised Scotland? The Celts who migrated *East* to our shores? The French, High Germans, Low Germans, Norse, French, Romance, Indians, Aryans, and so on who contributed so much to our wonderful language? The naturalised slaves and conscripts who have been part of British culture for centuries, even millenia? The Norsemen whose invasion and subsequent miscegeny with the locals informs so much of Scottish Highland and Island culture? Perhaps the good men of Kernow who share some common ancestry with the people of the Basque country?  Or the Gauls? Maybe the Goths or the Visigoths or the Huns who came here? Or was it the Huguenots? Or perhaps it was the dear old Romans, with their baths and their body of law and their salaries?

Which one?

Of course it's an impossible question, because it's a ridiculous notion to think that there is some sort of core British culture. It's utterly daft. You are welcome to your opinions; you are less welcome to expect that such simplistic fantasies will go unchallenged, or un-ridiculed, and if you wish to defend them with credible arguments you are *really* going to have to do some homework and study the vast corpus of British history - the real stuff, not the imaginary kind that petty racists like UKIP pretend to be true.

He rang the housephone 2 days ago and Dad picked up. Dad's only just got into the world of computing and it's helped him a lot with his business but he's not the most savvy. So this scrotebag managed to convince father he was from Microsoft and that the PC was full of viruses and they'd had an alert on their end and wanted to fix it. 

I only found this out when Dad handed me over to him; his tech-babble combined with his rapid fire heavily accented English meant he was virtually incomprehensible to my old man. Anyway he started asking me to go into Dad's PC and start pissing about with various options, I was vaguely suspicious of all this as I was fairly sure that big businesses like MS rarely, if ever, make cold calls. Furthermore I know Dad's PC is safe from viruses; he only uses a tiny number of websites and as far as I know he hasn't yet stumbled upon the wonders of internet porn and the myriad of viruses that discovery can bring. So I asked Fuckface Mc Scammerbloke again who he was from and exactly what he wanted, and he repeated his bare-faced lie. 

I tried to fuck him off politely, fed him some shit about having an appointment and needing to leave very soon but the obnoxious little turd persisted, telling me it 'would only take 5 more minutes' before trying to arrange a callback.

A friend of mine was in exactly the same position (Canada -&gt; UK) a few months back and from what I understand it doesn't really make a difference which bank you choose as it'll be the same process in all of them.

No restrictions on international transfers that I know of, when you open the bank account you'll be asked how much money you expect to see in your account (money laundering laws) but that's pretty much it. I'd recommend that you just take a look at the UK bank/building society websites (google will probably help with this), find one you like the look of and get in touch with them. Ask them what accounts they have available and interest rates etc.

With regards to tax.. you'd need to apply for a [national insurance number](https://www.gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number) in order to work.

If you get a job (legitimate, on the books..) then generally speaking employers are legally obliged to deduct tax before it's paid to you (PAYE - pay as you earn) so there isn't really much you need to do yourself. If you are self employed then you just register and complete a tax self-assessment at the end of the financial year then pay any tax you owe, so you'd need to set aside some money for that yourself.

Also, the 2014 personal allowance is £10,000 so you can earn up to that amount tax-free before you start paying any tax. http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/it.htm

I'd recommend that you bookmark [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/) as it has loads of useful information.

One more thing as it caught my friend off-guard, here you need a tv licence to watch ANY broadcast tv whether it's 'freeview' - free-to-air digital channels, or a paid satellite/cable service. Expect a visit from licencing officers if you buy a tv here or rent property where the previous tenant had a tv. http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"I am applying for various industries, and mainly applying in and around the North East, although I have applied for graduate schemes as far as places like Aberdeen and Swindon, though those aren't the norm for me. I've been looking in various industries, although I’d say a large proportion of them have been in either the automotive sector, or in energy related sectors such as Oil &amp; Gas, Renewable energy, Subsea etc. I've also made many applications to companies in the Process Industry (i.e. petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals etc.), due to the large presence this industry has in the North East.

First thing is, don't worry. There are engineering jobs out there, I have just been terribly unlucky in my search. There are a few things that I would like to share that either have helped me greatly, or that I wish I knew this time last year.

First, if you have not started yet, apply for anything and everything now (Prioritise, but don't be overly selective; you likely won't have your first job forever). If you don't have a complete CV yet, go to your university careers department and get an appointment to help with it. Once you get the CV nailed down it's much easier. Also, get the contact details of the person who deals with advice for Engineering students, as they periodically get opportunities mailed to them.

Secondly, don't just apply to advertised vacancies. Most companies don't advertise on external sites, so you need to seek them out. Business directories, industry/cluster organisations are a good place to start. The [North East Process Industry Cluster](http://www.nepic.co.uk/) and [NOF Energy](http://www.nofenergy.co.uk/home.html) are just a couple that I have used, I’m sure there are equivalents in other areas of the UK. Also use Google maps. Search for a vague term (i.e. Automotive, Petrochemical, Oil &amp; Gas) and then navigate around your area on Google maps. Make a note of all the companies shown and do a little bit of background research on each. Then contact them to enquire about any opportunities. Sometimes it's good to call first, but I prefer to email their recruitment/HR (Or if they don't have that, just their general 'info@companyname.co.uk' will do) with my CV and a cover letter, and then call to follow up a few days later. 

Thirdly, get your CV out there on as many jobsites and in the hands of as many recruitment agencies as possible. Try and keep regular contact with a few recruitment agents you get on with (As that way they will alert you with new opportunities and send your CV straight off because they already know you're a decent candidate). Whilst these sites are great for finding advertised vacancies (That goes without saying, you must check these every day), you will also find a lot of people bring opportunities to you. Sites off the top of my head, ranked by most usefulness to me:

http://www.cv-library.co.uk/

http://www.reed.co.uk/

http://www.gradcracker.com/

http://www.indeed.co.uk/

http://www.justengineers.net/

https://www.gov.uk/jobsearch

http://www.fish4.co.uk/account/job_hunt

http://home.monster.co.uk/home/

http://www.topengineeringjobs.com/

There are certainly more, but be aware that there is a lot of repeat vacancies across these sites. At the very least get yourself on CV-Library and Reed, as those are the two largest players in the market at current. Recruitment agencies tend to be region specific so unless you want to work in the North East I don't think I can help you there, but [Rise Technical Recruitment](http://www.risetechnicalrecruitment.co.uk/) are a good place to start, they have got me 3 interviews up to now, with another possible interview coming up.

Also, if you have interest in a company and they are local, Go and hand the CV/cover letter to them in person. Sometimes they turn you away at reception, sometimes their hiring manager has time to see you and you can have a chat (Last time I did this, they weren't hiring but I did get a list of their partners which gave me leads for other opportunities).

Also, if you are in contact with a company and you get the feeling they aren't sure, offer to do a short work placement to get some experience, as well as a good industry contact and reference (The job centre can cover travel expenses and continue JSA payments for 2-8 week placements). I think if I was open to this back in August/September, I would have a job by now. Only do it if it's highly relevant to what you want to do though, don't bother with the ones the job centre try and push on you as you will get very little out of it. I know a guy who did two separate placements at Poundland and didn't get the job either time - its blatant slavery.

I think that's everything, hope this helps, and good luck!

EDIT: Oh yeah, build yourself a LinkedIn profile, and use it to connect to classmates, lecturers and recruitment agents. It also has a careers section which can be useful, although it tends to focus on more senior positions. If you have an interview, be sure to ask (politely :P) if you can add the interviewers on LinkedIn. Also, be sure to follow up interviews yourself after a week or so, don't just wait for the company get back to you.

They said they were finishing up a couple of contracts and then they will carry out a small restructure. Once that was finished, they would get in touch. ""A few weeks"" he said.

Two weeks passed and nothing happened, so I called to find out if there had been any progress, but there were no updates.

Three months down the line and there has still been no updates. I've been in regular contact with them (Once a week, alternating between email and phone call so to not pester them too much), but it's still uncertain.

true,honestFeedback,null,null,"&gt; raw shale gas

The key word here is **raw**.  If the gas is dirty (I have no idea if it is or it isn't), it will be cleaned, dried and so it meets the required entry point criteria.

How do you think the gas transmission network works?  In the Great Britain there is one transmission system, run by Transco which has a number of entry and exit points.  All the gas, from north sea, the interconnectors, storage, LNG terminals etc enters the system via the entry points.  It's piped around the country to various smaller local distribution zones and on to end users.  At no point is it possible to separate or divert gas from once source to one exit point.  It's all just gas in a pipe and gas being gas it all gets jumbled up.  For this reason the quality of the gas entering the network is closely controlled so that the product is consistent to end users.

Just how exactly do you think that the ""poisonous"" shale gas would be separated out in the network to make sure it only gets to industrial plants?  And EVEN is that were possible - why would industrial plants be able to deal with contaminated gas any better than a domestic user?

The rest of your post is quite hard to read because of the formatting, but none of it appears to related to the quality of the gas entering the network, it's about environmental impact of fracking.  I've not commented and will not comment on that as it's something I know nothing about.  It has no relevance on the point under discussion.

true,wherearemyfeet,null,null,"&gt;In some cases, yes - celebrities do bribe charities for positive exposure.

That is not a bribe in the least. It's a donation, albeit lacking altruism, but it's sure as hell not a bribe.

&gt;What you're apparently not getting - real-world usage of natural language is full of exaggerations, metaphors and similes, and words used in extremely general ways.

No, I get that. What you don't seem to be getting, however, is that the term ""bribe"" has a set definition that, even with some clever wordplay, doesn't in any way describe what has happened here. When we see bribes being paid, they are done in exchange for favourable conditions for the person paying the bribe. There is zero evidence to suggest this is in any way the case

From what I can see, a rich guy has made a donation to a candidate of his liking. Anything beyond that is baseless.

&gt;Of course no doubt you're very happy when the negative terms are used against people you disapprove of and the positive terms for people you approve of.

I should point out that I'm not in support of either the candidate or the donor in this instance, so the circumstances you describe are the ones at play now. Frankly it doesn't matter who we're talking about, I wouldn't use the word ""bribe"" to describe a set of circumstances that in no way matches the definition of a bribe.

&gt;The point I think you should have made from the start is one you just made here - ""it was given by a guy who owns an unquoted percentage of a smaller payday loan company"".

&gt;his is taking the piss, So I have this 700x78 telescope and a canon 550d, and am unsure what to do. 50mm lens, 1600 max iso and a trusty tripod should do this sort of photography?

Yes you can definitely get some interesting shots with that equipment. The photo I showed was just a 50mm lens at about f/2.8 and 3200 ISO if I remember correctly. Each exposure was 15 seconds and I took about 150 exposures. Then I used some free software to align the images. I think the software also applied a colour correction to remove the orange glow, but It's been a while so can't remember exactly how that worked.

&gt; That is not a bribe in the least. It's a donation, albeit lacking altruism, but it's sure as hell not a bribe.

By your own definition, sure, it's a bribe. Let's try the [Oxford dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/bribe) - ""Dishonestly persuade (someone) to act in one’s favour by a gift of money or other inducement"". Well, the bit you'd no doubt contest here is ""dishonestly"". But really, the use here is just a subjective judgement of whether it's considered moral to persuade someone using some inducement in a particular context. Different people find different things dishonest, and trying to gain a reputation for altruism in this way is IMO potentially a dishonest thing. Obviously it's also just what celebrities do - basically a part of the job - but as I said, I wouldn't always describe it as a bribe.

And that's the thing - ""bribe"" to most people implies the combination of an objectively definable act and a subjective judgement about that act. Subjective judgements are subjective.

As for the word games - well, I'm afraid to me the word games are more fun than the actual issue. My current political leanings are slightly towards labour - despite the more literal bribes I recall them taking in the not-that-distant past.

I have stopped mentioning them because clearly you are never going to change your mind on that so I thought I would pick at a different thread in your very frayed argument.

&gt;Your first quoted bullet point shows that more than half of a days arrivals do so within a 3 hour window. That's not 'not by much' in anyone's book?

That is sort of the point of rush hour.

**Regime side:**

* Regime forces (the Syrian Arab Army and National Defence Forces) - these are responsible for the overwhelming majority of atrocities in this conflict according to the UN and NGOs who are operating on the ground in Syria. In fact, it's so bad the UN Human Rights Commissioner says there's ""no comparison"".

* Hezbollah - Shi'ite militia who generally behave better than regime forces but still responsible for atrocities, tend to be more useful in defending the regime than the SAA who are often poorly trained and forced into battle.

* Shi'ite militia - these are numerous smaller groups who also fight for the regime for religious and political reasons. Sometimes they're paid mercenaries.

* Iranian forces - fight for the regime, hold huge sway due to Iran's commitment in backing the Syrian government.

* Russian mercenaries - small groups of these have been hired by the Syrian regime, it looks like they've pulled out of fighting now and/or been killed.

**Rebel side:**

* Free Syrian Army: defectors of the Syrian Arab Army who refused to shoot civilians protesting against Assad's dictatorship. Beholden to the Syrian National Coalition, a coalition of prominent Syrians who have spent their lives opposing Assad in favour of democratic rule - often in exile. Supported by various Arab and Western nations.

* Syrian Revolutionaries Front - Similar to above, pursue a free, secular and democratic Syria. Supported by various Arab and Western nations.

* Islamic Front - Range from conservative Islamists to moderate Islamists, also contain Jabhat Al Nusra which is Syria's homegrown Al Qaeda. Known for having better arms and equipment as well as fighting ability which led to them attracting a lot of rebels. Now as high tech arms begin flowing to the secular rebels they seem to have lost some of their appeal. Have recently moderated their views in an effort to draw wider appeal. Responsible for some atrocities.

* Islamic State of Iraq in the Levant (ISIL) - A group so bad they were disowned by Al Qaeda. Basically the Taliban, totalitarian Islamists who seek to control everything about a territory and its people as soon as they conquer it. Extremely hostile to those who don't follow their interpretation of Islam. Currently most of their battles are against other rebel groups like the Islamic Front, the FSA and Kurds.

* Kurdish groups - they have fought against other rebel groups and against the regime, generally seek Kurdish autonomy and hostile to the Syrian regime. Syrian forces have temporarily fought alongside them but generally they have been fighting against the regime like the other rebels have. Generally pro-democracy and secular.

Based on this, fighting for the Kurds, FSA or SRF are fine as long as they abide by Geneva Conventions whereas fighting for any other group is sanctionable due to their atrocious treatment of civilians and/or contempt of democracy.

true,Norvaldov,lfc68,,"Finnan was a quality defender, but he wasnt the biggest contributor in attack. Riise had work ethic and a good left leg, but he was never the best defender. The way I see it, Rodgers' system requires full backs that can attack **and** defend well. 

A fully fit Enrique is a valid option in my book (given that he manages to recover fully from his injury). On the right, I'd not be hesitant to give Flanagan opportunities to keep developing, but I dont think he should be our first choice. Like you say though, he'll still get plenty of chances.

The question then is what to do with depth: at the moment, we dont really have more than one LB, and while we have cover on the right, I dont think we have the quality there. Johnson is not what he used to be, so he is a dubious choice, and his wages are simply too high for him to be used as back up. If we're willing to play Flanagan as our main RB, then our cover there would probably be either Wisdom or Kelly, which I personally think would leave our right back too weak on a whole.

 To me, then, it makes sense to sign someone at RB, and as Flanagan is still developing I think it'd be a mistake not to look for a starter rather than an even younger player to blood alongside him. We need another player on the left as well, but if Enrique gets back to where he was and stays fit I'd say he's our best FB at this point. While there are certainly better LBs out there, getting some young talent in is a decent option on the left if we fail to land one.

So, for first team quality: RB &gt; LB

Ah - so you're claiming that donations (and the possibility of their drying up) don't act as an incentive to politicians?

Well whether you believe that incentives exist, whether they're intended or not, and whether you believe that actual doners and actual politicians are very much aware of that and perfectly capable of taking a hint, I can assure you that incentives are a big part of the Tory faith. When Tories use the logic of incentives even in a few cases where incentives have been proven to be counterproductive, they can hardly complain if people interpret their behavior relative to doners as being open to and influenced by financial incentives.

And BTW - subjective doesn't mean imaginary or neutral - it means [""Based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions""](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/subjective) (at least according to the Oxford dictionary).

I have stayed at Unite McDonald road accommodation (self catered and en-suite) and to be honest I wish I didn't. The place is quite nice but it's also quite far from the central campus.. I had to go to king's buildings everyday (science campus - past central campus) and that takes 40 mins by bus and. Similarly the other Unite accommodation (beaverbank) nearby is quite far from campus.. 

I would definitely recommend Pollock's or other central accommodation.. I've heard really good things about Blackfriars and most of the ones in Cowgate (very central area ideal for the central campus and pubs and clubs)..

Again it really depends what kind of life you wanna have.. I've noticed that in Unite there's many more international and elder students who (no offense) ruin the fresher's vibe.. but then again it is ideal when it comes to exam time and it's mostly dead quiet whereas in Pollock's or Cowgate/Pleasance (where the gym is - there's an accommodation there as well which is pretty nice not sure what its called though sorry) you need to expect noise and parties both in the building and on the road.

I was quite unlucky with the flatmates I ended up with (both international and I haven't seen both in quite a while now - I sometimes wonder if they actually live here) but then just a few flats down the corridor there's my friends who I go out with and we still manage to have more fun.. In Unite accommodation you manage to get much more privacy as well (which is not always a good thing) whereas in other places everything is much more ""open""..

Price wise I think it doesn't make a massive difference: you will learn to adapt very soon to pretty much everything.. I like how Unite is set out and everything is quite modern and the maintenance team are always ready to help.. I've heard of mice in the walls in other accommodations but I think (hope) that was simply due to some works done nearby. If I were you I would invest in location though: you will adapt to the room and kitchen, but it's hard if you live 30 mins away from campus

Please please please ask any other questions that you have (not only accommodation wise if you want)! I would love to help! Couldn't find much info last year so might as well make them available now!

Ok, so here are the reasons I feel we should leave the EU. There are others, in fact if I were to list them all it would take me half an hour to type this, but here are a few of them in a nutshell:

-Laws that force us in the UK to change the way we do things are passed by people we did not vote for.

-The EU costs us a fucking fortune. Did you know VAT is an EU tax? We also pay huge membership fees.

-The European Court of Human Rights is not all flowers and puppies. It actually prevents us from deporting a lot of dangerous criminals because the conditions they would face in their home countries as punishment for crimes they committed there are deemed inhumane. This includes people like hate-preacher Abul Hamza.

-Unchecked immigration means that we are not properly vetting people who come into the UK. We practically have an open door. Additionally, our immigration system is being abused by people who arrive, work for long enough to get a national insurance number, then are able to claim healthcare and other benefits. A lot of people feel that the system is far too open to abuse, even if only a small minority are abusing it.

 -If we left the EU we would have more freedom to make stronger trade deals for ourselves a a country rather than being dependent on the EU.

-Our farming and fishing industries have become far less profitable under EU laws.

-When we voted to enter the EEC, long before I was even born (I'm 33), we voted to enter a trading community. Since then we have given up more and more of our sovereignty to the EU. It costs us more and dictates more to us every year. During the 15 years I have been legally old enough to vote I have never had a chance to vote against it.

I'm not saying this is the way it should be: we let in 30+ goals more than should be considered acceptable so we'll see what Brendan does about that, if anything.

I may be totally off-base but I think fullback is well down the transfer priority list.  I honestly think we can challenge for the league with Flanagan, Johnson, Enrique and some combination of Kelly, Wisdom or even McLaughlin perhaps playing in the league cup (he got a look last summer so he will again).

""Greens want to see an end to all animal experimentation

Greens believe that immediate action must be taken to:

•	Stop non-medical experiments [cosmetic testing has already been banned, only 'non-medical' thing I can think of is safety testing on things like agrichemicals and household chemicals (which when we are talking everyday exposure is arguably medically relevant testing...)].

•	Stop the use of primates, cats and dogs in research [primates are the best animal models, testing on apes is already banned]. 

•	**Stop using genetically altered animals** [this would totally fuck a lot of research into things like development and molecular biology - transgenic lines are key to fundamental research, belies a total lack of understanding of biological research.  Hell, if this went as far as transgenic Drosophila it would be a MAJOR research hindrance]""

...

•	A ban on Genetically Modified food [seems largely policies conflating the problems with large agrichemical companies and GM crops themselves]

•     GM crops to be kept out of Europe.

...

""

A moratorium on transgenic animals is a massive block for me, it is painful that a theoretically progressive and scientific party has such an utter lack of understanding of how modern molecular biology functions.  

I think that is what annoys me with the Greens, its a party I feel I (and my colleagues) as lefty life scientists should be able to support but these kinds of ideological policies that seem to brook no discussion just put me totally off.  There is thoroughly inconsistent application of rational and scientific discussion to their policies.   

On the other hand with labour or lib dems manifestos (actions are a different matter), there are plenty of policies I don't fully support but they tend to be a lot more gray.  I can more often see a justification even if I don't totally agree with it.   

In terms of greyscale (where pure white would be complete alignment with my views): 

-  greens are largely 'white' with several totally 'black' policies: averaging to lightish grey     

- labour and lib dem policies are a mix of white and grey: averaging to a fairly similar shade of grey...

[It is worth noting this meandering ramble is entirely based around stated policies rather than previous actions (coalition, new labour or Brighton local government).]

Despite that, I am thinking of joining the Greens (if not voting for them) because at least there is a chance to try and change the above kind of issues as a party member.

They have a longer standing tradition of being an Alternative for Unionists in their early history and later opting to be neutral. They are capable of weathering the brunt of criticism and have shown they don't bend easily. They have strong Candidates in Naomi Long and Anna Lo, and proved enough of a threat to established Unionist parties that they [actively manufactured](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-20317461) the the Flags Protests and subsequent crisis. 
These actions will see the decimation of Alliances vote in East Belfast and elsewhere.

Ironically these events spurned a copycat party from the bowels of the UUP. Faced with an image problem some self aware Unionists decided it was high time for a makeover, time for a non-sectarian Unionist Party; ignoring the fact that this had happened before 44 Years ago with the formation of the Alliance Party.

That means that while you might agree with their policies now, they're subject to change if they think they can get a bigger vote with a different policy. They're targeting groups who might be less likely to vote with campaigns that will make NI21 look exciting and different, as soon as those groups start being more involved, suddenly they'll target the next groups that aren't voting or aren't involved.

Alliance, on the other hand, do actually have policies they've stood by and while they change them to stay fairly up to date, they don't pander to whoever they're talking to - they don't try to be unionist *and* other. They're fairly firm in most of their stances, and I would say you can probably trust them to stick to their policies whereas I wouldn't trust NI21 at all in that sense, I feel like if they decided that right-wing nationalists were where the votes lay, they'd switch to that.

Gay is more mainstream now, the growing acceptance, socially, culturally and politically, of LGBT people and families seems to have sort of created/encouraged more right wing LGBT people. 

Just a decade or so ago, it would have been unthinkable to support right wing, traditionalist parties like the Conservatives given legislation like Section 28 and the outspoken homophobes of the party - support for parties like Labour was a given.

Now you can settle down with your two kids, work in a fancy finance job with a nice wife/hubbie and rant about ""those immigrants coming over here"" whether you're gay, bi or straight. LGBTers aren't having to vote Labour for fear of persecution from traditional right wing parties. They vote based on different criteria, not for survival, now - they don't feel persecuted, so a comment or two from a silly old twat won't put them off because they don't think it will come to anything.

Jonjoe Kenny sounds great - if he doesn't reach that 6ft mark maybe Coleman could take him under his wing at RB? I love seeing that we have a lot of CM's coming through the ranks, and am equally stoked on reading about Russel Griffiths - by 2018, who knows? He could be Joel's understudy :p

true,pluralalpha,null,null,"You'll want to be renting through the university's Accommodation Services in your first year. All bills are included in the price, as is cleaning (communal areas in flats, communal areas and bedrooms in Pollock Halls) and it's a nine month contract. All sites have a laundry room and (all?) have bike storage. There is also a Security department that looks after all the sites. Prices start about £60/week for a shared room in Pollock, £55 a week for a shared room in a flat, £100 a week for a single room in a flat and £160 a week for a single room in Pollock Halls. [The website is really informative.](http://www.accom.ed.ac.uk/accommodation/accommodation-search/) It has actual pictures of the rooms and gives approximate distances to George Square (where you'll be studying) and shops etc. 

**Pollock Halls:**

*Pros:* catered, great facilities (computer lab, squash courts, on site shop, on site bar, common rooms in every building, security is based on site, easy to meet people, room cleaned once a week, communal areas and bathrooms cleaned (near) daily, 20 mins walk/less than 10 mins cycle from central area (where you will be studying). It can be a great social experience if your personality suits.

*Cons:* a lot more (~£60/week) more expensive than flats, only two meals a day, no lunch- you can take from breakfast if you don't get caught but cheese sandwiches and a banana gets old fast, I'd imagine it can feel a little overwhelming especially if you're quite introverted. 

**Flats:**

*Pros:* Far more independence than Pollock halls, a good set of flatmates (you usually get around 4) makes it an amazing experience, tend to be closer to central campus though make sure you check, more affordable price, less of a 'jump' to a privately rented flat in second year. Easier to get to know 4 others in a flat than 20 others on your corridor.  

*Cons:* You have to cook for yourself, generally take more responsibility for yourself. Conflicts in the flat are more consuming than conflicts in halls. Kincaids, College Wynd, Roberson's Close and Blackfriars are on the Cowgate where there are lots of clubs. It gets 'lively' at night (lived there for a year). I never had any trouble and there are usually police around, but if you're a light sleeper beware!

And his diving problem, for a striker as big as you say he is he is on the ground a lot. Atletico fans will tell you this is one of the most annoying thigns about him. And of course the fact that he is a cunt.

Did you know Terry has a history of spitting on people's faces too? Did you know Drogba, for a striker as big as everyone knows, had a diving problem too?

&gt; Hamstrings are the type of injuries that can come back to haunt you, especially if you don't take the time to heal it properly the way he did.

No they can't. Robben had several hamstring injuries while he was with us because he kept getting rushed back. Moved to Real, same thing. Moved to Bayern, where he got the treatment and time he needed, and he's lethal again.

&gt; Depends what you call great. If you are talking about the type of season we would want a world - class striker to have than absolutely not. His past seasons hardly compare to other top players or even himself this season.

You have no idea what you're talking about do you? When Costa was loaned out to Rayo two seasons ago, who were in the Liga as well, he scored 4 goals in his first three games, then went on to score 10 in 16. At the age of 22. The next season he only had 10 goals in the league because he was playing as a support striker to Falcao. And Falcao being Falcao was always going to score more and take more responsibility.

&gt; That is true, but the fact that the physicality and the pace of the PL would hardly be an issue for a striker like Martinez and the fact that he has been consistently scoring goals for his club for multiple seasons leads you to believe there is less of a chance that he could not acclimate to the league.

That argument is baseless.

&gt; Costa has been a great goal scorer this season but hasn't been a consistent goal scorer for multiple seasons. And CL is much more reliant on the team in general, which Atletico is a better one of course compared to Porto.

And look where Atletico are in the season that they relied on him.

&gt; You need to wait until the WC to see if his injury doesn't keep coming back and not giving him play time. Its would be also nice to see how he could do with Spain, the only match I watched of him in a Spanish shirt (and the only game I think he has played so far?) he was dreadful and looked completely out of place. Hopefully he does better in the summer, but we can't know that unless we actually wait to see him...

I respect your opinion - I also have Jewish friends that have commented on anti-Semitism from what they see as the rising Muslim population in Britain, so I understand concerns about community cohesion.

I'm not naive, I know the situation in the UK is good and that it is in fact the exception rather than the rule regarding gay rights. However I would challenge your view that immigrants threaten equal rights for LGBT people. Where is your evidence? Groups may have expressed homophobic views but so did ""home grown"" organisations like the Church of England. It's not just immigrants who threaten LGBT people - in fact, given the hate often directed at them, people are less likely to back their views, surely.

meant;

If you don't say what you mean, you're a liar and also can be forgotten.

&gt;There isn't one. However, it's 100% true that by and large, CHILDREN (you know fine what I mean) are less capable of handling mature situations than ADULTS (don't you even fucking think about giving me your ""adults are children"" bollocks again).

Most of your comment seems to be repeat; if it was irrelevant the first time, it's still irrelevant.

&gt;I didn't say ""have sex with your own children"", idiot. Another example of you ignoring and twisting the clear meaning of my words. 

Idiots (loners) are better than mòrons (dolts).  Actually it's you who twists words' meanings.  I gave you the proper words and you refused to use them.

&gt;I was being facetious. /u/DarqWolff is a redditor infamous for his rant about being better than everyone else.
&gt;&gt;An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.

&gt;&gt;My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it.

DarqWolff's IQ is about 147.  Mine should be in the millionth percentile.

him, -&gt; him;

http://www.quora.com/Physics/Have-the-known-true-laws-of-physics-ever-been-broken-ever/answer/Autymn-Castleton

I don't agree with DarqWolff's diction and composition, nor pacifism, nor sexualities.

&gt;Every sane person who speaks the English language calls people ""x year olds"". If you're the only one who's saying it ""correctly"", you're wrong. LANGUAGE FUCKING EVOLVES.

Every sound person examines oneself.  You're wrong.

&gt;pedo is the shortened form of pedophile. you know exactly what I meant, as would anyone else in the english speaking world.

Perv is the shortened form of pervert.  It does not conflict with any other senses or constructions.  You are a word perv.

&gt;That's condescending as fuck. You're denying that the world has progressed since these words were first introduced. Anyway, decay is still a form of evolution. The language is changing over time. As I've said before, if you're the only one who's still using the word 'pedo', 'child' or whatever ""correctly"", YOU'RE WRONG. Could you imagine looking at a park and saying to someone ""look at the pedos playing in the park""? They wouldn't understand what the fuck you're on about. In Ancient Greece they would, but WE DON'T LIVE IN ANCIENT FUCKING GREECE.

A language loses words by forget and decay until it must steal words of other languages.  The argumentum ad populum fallacy means you're wrong.  Someone is not a they: 1 != 2.  If I were wrong, I could bring no argument or what argument I could can be refuted.  What supports mine is propriety.  What supports yours is popularity.  You should know that popular opinion flips on a whim.

&gt;No, they don't. A pedophile, by any other name, would still be looked on with disgust from society.

Nobody *would* be looked with disgust, you lackwit.

&gt;A word can have multiple meanings. ""Tablet"" can refer to a pill, to a slab of stone for writing on, or to a type of computer. ""Light"" can refer to what comes out of a lightbulb, or it can mean the opposite of heavy, or it can mean to set something on fire. By the same token, ""child"" can mean someone who's born of a parent, or it can mean someone regarded as ""underage"". HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES.

This was not what I said.  A word's senses can be inclusive, but not exclusive.  A tablet refers to a shape.  ""Light"" is the sad fusion of two roots with two spellings; I discard the Norman yogh and write ""liht"" and ""leiht"".  Information loss is bad.  When you bid the reader look at context to determine meaning, that means a word cannot be trusted and statements with that word cannot be a standard for ethics or politics.

&gt;Yes, but the opposite of child is also adult. Source: EVERY FUCKING THESAURUS EVER.

The [partial] opposite of adult is already youth.  Your lackwittedness of far-reacht contradictory terms is a flaw and shame.

&gt;No, the board software is using ""child"" in the context ""born of a parent"". It's saying nothing about whether ""child"" can also mean ""not an adult"".

It still agrees with me.

&gt;One can perfectly well speak to a keyboard, it's just that one would look like a complete fucking goon doing so. Also, again, you knew what I meant. Stop being a pedantic cunt.

keyboard;

I said on, not to.  I'll stop when you no longer need it.

&gt;Yes, they are. They have become part of English. We speak English, source: EVERY SANE PERSON IN THE ENTIRE FUCKING ENGLISH SPEAKING WORLD.

What world speaks English?  Your world speaks Einglish.  Look carefully.  If any such words were English you could look them up in a dictionary and see nothing but English and Englisc in their history.

&gt;It's you who's nonsensical. Nobody exclusively uses the historic literal meaning of words. If I'm being nonsensical, so is EVERYONE ELSE. And again, if you're the only ""sensical"" person to the point where you deny understanding what everyone else is saying despite the fact you understand fine, it's you who's the idiot.

I'm nobody then, a moral absolutist.

http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/citizenship

&gt; Citizenship prepares students to become active citizens of democracy. Our Citizenship specifications allow students to apply their learning to real-life scenarios on both a local and global scale.

&gt; Citizenship Studies provides the opportunity for students to work individually to develop their own knowledge and also encourages students to work with others and take part in group activities to bring about a change.

&gt; From GCSE to A-level our Citizenship specifications offer a clear route of progression, building on the relationship between the individual, the law and the state, and the nature of identities.





#GCSE

&gt; Citizenship Studies (4105) 

&gt; GCSE Citizenship Studies helps students develop skills such as critical thinking, decision making and collaborative working.

&gt; Our specification – a two unit short course and a four unit full course – helps students to develop as active citizens of our democracy. The active citizenship element is strongly developed through controlled assessment which accounts for 60 per cent of the qualification. 

&gt; This course meets the compulsory requirement for Citizenship to be studied in the National Curriculum and is suitable for all students. It gives students transferable skills and an insight into other subjects such as Law and Sociology.

#A Level

&gt; Citizenship Studies (2100) 




&gt; A-level Citizenship Studies helps students communicate and articulate different views, ideas and perspectives. It develops their ability to work with others and use problem-solving and critical approaches to issues.

&gt; This four-unit specification requires students to develop their ability to advocate, negotiate, plan, make decisions and take action on Citizenship issues. It enables students to select, interpret, analyse and evaluate information to construct reasoned and coherent arguments.

&gt; This course is particularly suitable for students who have studied the Citizenship Key Stage 4 programme of study as part of the National Curriculum.

Think of Matt Smith's goodbye, he saw her as a child, he always did. She was what The Doctor, desperately trying to forget the events between the original seasons and this regeneration. She is his friend, as shown is season 7. Think of River's words at Lake Silencio, 

""We're his friends. We do what the Doctor's friends always do. As we're told.""

Amy had a role to play, and she played it no matter the cost to herself. You can see where her loyalties lie in certain episodes. Amy's Choice, subtly in The Pandorica Opens and Big Bang, Day of the Moon, The Doctor's Wife, and The Girl Who Waited specifically. After The God Complex Amy is essentially free to act on her real devotions without fear of hurting The Doctor, and all through season 7 she's on Rory's side, especially at their finale. 

Basically what I'm trying to say is The Dreamlord wasn't just messing with Amy and Rory, he was reminding the doctor that he was selfishly toying with her, using everything he inherently is to dominate her. In his own words in The God Complex:

DOCTOR: I brought them here. They'd say it was their choice, but offer a child a suitcase full of sweets and they'll take it. Offer someone all of time and space and they'll take that, too. Which is why you shouldn't. Which is why grown-ups were invented. 
RITA: All of time and space, eh?

true,arselona,null,null,"UKIP really fecked this all up. 

I believe it all dates back to the meeting Farage had with Murdoch in 2013. My view is that this was a classic trap.

Lure him in with promise of support - tell him the secret to getting the public on side is to talk about immigration - and then set him up to get hammered by the press when the elections creep closer, thus protecting the rent-seeking bottom feeding relationship with the EU for big business and special interest groups. 

Right now, with UKIP written off by the public as quasi nazis we basically have zero parties who want to seriously challenge the relationship with Europe. 

For example, I am not inherently anti EU, but boy does it need restructuring, and without people like Farage there to pull peoples cards in public - the charade will just escalate.

I have totally mixed feelings about UKIP. I think that if UKIP hadn't tried to expand too quickly, and tried to get more councillors to the detriment of their core principles as a free market libertarian party, and had concentrated on the EU bureaucracy, they would be in a much better position now. 

As it stands, they have moved away from being a free market libertarian group into some refuge shelter for wacko provincial tory outcasts, and disaffected racist Labourites. 

Regarding their views on immigration, I'd say two things. 

1) UKIP betrayed their own faith in the free market. Yes, there are issues with illegal immigrants coming over and undermining the work force. However, like narcotics, these industries thrive on being untaxable. 

Since it became legal for Romanians and Bulgarians to come over, the numbers have dropped - why?- because now it isn't as profitable for them to do so now.

There is a difference between getting in illegally, living 10 to one flat, and not paying tax and coming over legally, and getting taxed and stealth taxed to fuck like the rest of us.  

UKIP should have remembered the principles of free market economics that they claim to champion and trusted that the free flow of capital is a far better legislator than any knee jerk reactionary law could be. 

2) I think these racist claims are nonsense. Farage has been quite unequivocal in that he favours a relationship with the commonwealth. Last time I checked, there were a lot of non anglo-saxons in that group. Anyway, point 2 is just a technical observation, and much less important than point 1. 

Anyway, in my view, UKIP have blown it and even if they do survive, they will always be a circus tent bastardisation of what they had the potential to be.

You mentioned not knowing the rules or positions, that would be very unusual in Britain. I don't really pay attention to football but I (and probably everyone in the country) could watch a game and follow it, understanding what was a foul and why that's a goal and so on. It's a relatively simple game which helps.

In general I guess the stereotype is more or less true, certainly there will be a lot of flags flying and people gathering during the world cup, at least for every match England plays. Lots of people will watch other countries play too, and that's more or less the case with regular games, people normally watch 'their' team but might or might not bother with the other ones. I assume that's more or less the case with American Football in the US. It's hard to really compare without spending enough time in another country to have a second viewpoint.

Rodgers seems to not like the idea of having Agger and Sakho as a centre pairing, leaving one of them on the bench for most of the season is a waste for them playing wise and for the club wage wise. Skrtel loves to back away rather than commit when defending causing us to drop very deep when we are under the pump. Kolo is Kolo.

Simple really, and presumably there is a black market in compromised devices, and quite possibly the individual scammer gets paid per successful hit.

OP on money laundering,

&gt;Well one way might be to play the roulette machine and put money on black and red. You might lose if it hits zero but nobody would be any the wiser if done correctly and it looks like ""won"" money. You could also bet on dogs, basically a one in six chance each time so the odds aren't that great but it's still won money. Could also put money on one dog in one bookmakers and then go to another 5 and bet on each dog, let's say the dog wins at 3 to 1, then you lose some money but it's clean and considered a gambling win. Just some ideas and I'm sure there are plenty more but that's how I would go about it 

OP on scamming pescription drugs,
&gt;Pure codeine is only prescribed for heroin withdrawal. You can get 30mg codeine/500mg paracetamol tablets from a doctor easily, I have been getting them for 20 years from many different doctors quite easily. Just go to your doc and tell him you need to take 16 over the counter co-codamol a day, and he will instantly give you ones with more codeine. It's really easy cos no doctor wants to see you taking 16 paracetamol a day! Failing that you can buy OTC co-codamol and just use cold water extraction to remove the codeine from the paracetamol. Nothing illegal about it either!
Edit: lately many doctors have been favoring tramadol instead of high strength codeine (because it's cheaper to produce), but just tell him you've tried tramadol before and it made you vomit all the time!",0,1400661489,null,0,1400661696,0,chnd9ow,t3_263qxg,t1_chnd9ow,t1_chnczvn,null,1433889928,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,GaProgMan,null,null,"As a stereotype: I would say that men in England (I don't know about Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland) are either a fan of:

* Football
* Football and [Rugby Union](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union)
* Football and [Rugby League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_league)
* Football and *BOTH* types of Rugby
* Rugby Union
* Rugby League
* Both types of rugby
* None of the above

Depending on where you are in the UK, one or the other will be more prevalent or preferred. Usually the southern areas of England are Rugby Union (considered a middle class game) and the northern areas are Rugby League (considered a working class game).

Football tends to attract more hooligans (people who only attend the game to start a riot or fight afterwards), and both sports attract fiercely loyal fans. Since teams don't tend to move around (as they do in the NFL), a person may be a fan of a single team for life. As an example, the FA (Football Association) Cup final was held this past weekend where Arsenal took on Hull City, one Hull City fan (who was in his eighties) had said that he'd waited his whole life to see his home town team get to the final.

Pubs in England are sometimes (unofficially) reserved for fans of either sport, and it's not uncommon to see ""home fans only"" (fans of the home team only) signs outside pubs near stadiums. It's not that often that a stadium will host game played by teams from outside of the city.

A fair chunk of the population are football and rugby agnostic, and tend to pass it off as a waste of time so don't be worried if you speak to folk in England who are not fans of either. I, myself prefer NFL, but I recognise the skill involved in playing Rugby and  Football at a high enough level to be in an organised team.

That being said, there are a lot of ""casual"" football fans who will get behind the national team (sometimes when a local team gets to the championship game, too). However, especially with the casual England fans, there's an expectation of failure - simply because the England team haven't been seen to be of world standard since the early 80's by most.

Rugby Union fans will refer to the Rugby World Cup as ""the only world cup that matters"", the same can (and will be) said about football fans and the World Cup for that.

From my experience, there tend to be more football fans than Rugby fans in England (again, I can't talk about the other countries in the UK), and they tend to be more boisterous and vocal.

One interesting side effect of World and European (football) Cups is that, over the last two decades there have been ""official"" football songs released, and charted. I'm not sure where the money goes, but sometimes the footballers themselves are drafted into singing the song and, on occasion, stand up comedians too.

Football is quite engrained in English society (probably because it doesn't have the public school background of Rugby). I can walk down my street, or go to my local park, and see groups of teenagers playing football or performing tricks like [keepie uppies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keepie_uppie). There are songs, stories, poems, TV shows, movies and even dramatic stage shows about ""the beautiful game""

true,Norvaldov,lfc68,,"This was just looking at our FBs, mind you, not a statement on our transfers in general. I'm not saying we should look at signing two FBs first and foremost, but I definately believe it is a position worth strengthening. In all honesty, we can probably say that about most positions, but in terms of strengthening the starting eleven directly, I'd say both FB positions are on my list, with the RB near the top.

If we continue to play Flanagan on the left, that side is okay (again assuming Enrique gets back to his former level). Johnson and Wisdom on the right is fair too, but Glen is a bit of an open question to me at this point. He certainly needs to find himself again this summer.

We're better off if we keep developing Flanagan at LB, as this allows us to use the likes of Wisdom as a back up at the right, but I obviously dont know what the manager is thinking. I've said before and still think Flanagan should be allowed to play consistently on one side to keep developing, though.

In this view, we dont really need to sign anyone, but Johnson has injury problems and both him and Enrique need to get back to their former levles (one due to a poor season and injuries and the other after a long injury break). In the end, I guess I'm afraid of us challenging on more (and more competetive) fronts with as many questions as we currently have at FB.

While I agree to an extent that our FBs arent important to BRs system in the traditional run up and create width and cross kind of way, our game often finds them in space on the opposition's half and allows them to come forward and contribute in attack. To me, part of why the impact has been minimal so far is the quality of our FBs on the ball. Johnson should be good at this, but has had a bad season. Enrique was also decent in this department. Back to those question marks.

I don't give a shite about ""social norms"" (IT guy + geek + all my social circle smokes, in any case), and I don't see addictions as necessarily bad (we are all addicted to something in our lives) as long as we understand and accept the consequences. 

Used e-cigs before, and liked them a hell of a lot, back before they were widely spread, but ended up not being able to find cartridges for them. 

Years later, I started vaping in the workplace after a colleague suggested them to me (eGOs from liberty-flights). I absolutely loved them!!! 

A 100ml bottle of my favourite all-day vaping juice will last me 2-3 months and its £35 (as opposed to £250 pcm). I haven't yet made the transition to the Provari (saving up for it though), so eGO batteries are £15 every 5-6 months (large capacity ones) and the atomiser coils for my Evod cost around £10 for a pack of 5 (I use 1 per month or so).

The device itself is easy to deal with and maintain, with hardly any leakage, and it looks utterly cyber-geeky (which in my circles is both cool and a conversational item). The juices are SO much better, taste-wise, than cigarettes in the UK, and there are infinite pre-made and DIY combos to suite every taste (I have an all-day vape and a chilling-out vape).

Equally importantly, I went from 20+ cigarettes a day to 3-4 a day (most of them with my colleagues during a ciggy break) without a single complaint!! Exactly the same goes for my partner, who was equally a 20+ cigarette a day person. And I've even managed to get my mom in Greece onto them (20+ per day person too).

Most amazingly (and amusingly), on my last trip to Greece this Easter I actually vaped 2/3 of the time, which is a first EVER for me!! And I've lost track of the number of people who asked me where I got it from and how they can get one too!!

&gt;__Bodiam Castle__ is a 14th-century [moated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moat) [castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle) near [Robertsbridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertsbridge) in [East Sussex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Sussex), England. It was built in 1385 by Sir [Edward Dalyngrigge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Dalyngrigge), a former knight of [Edward III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_III_of_England), with the permission of [Richard II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_II_of_England), ostensibly to defend the area against French invasion during the [Hundred Years' War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War). Of [quadrangular plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrangular_castle), Bodiam Castle has no [keep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keep), having its various chambers built around the outer defensive walls and inner courts. Its corners and entrance are marked by towers, and topped by [crenellations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlement). Its structure, details and situation in an artificial watery landscape indicate that display was an important aspect of the castle's design as well as defence. It was the home of the Dalyngrigge family and the centre of the [manor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorialism) of [Bodiam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodiam).

true,myimportantthoughts,cnty-uk,It's grim up North London,"&gt; People seem to care more about our relationship with the EU than say, global warming or nuclear power.

I think this is the problem, the green party don't have any well known policies other than not liking nuclear power, which is IMO a fantastic error. Nuclear vs renewables is not a major issue for most people, and a lot of the people who are interested support nuclear. So they are making a stand on the wrong side of a non-issue.

They would do much better to focus on big issues where the main 3 parties are making unpopular choices. They do have some policy ideas I think would be very popular:


1. abolishing tuition fees
2. Decriminalize weed
2. scrap HS2, 
3. nationalizing the railways 
4. properly sorting out corporate taxation
5. charging people in expensive houses more council tax and people in cheap houses less.

If the average person saw a list of their policies, I think that they would be fairly enthusiastic, but are perhaps automatically written off as hippies because of the name and the focus on the environment. They really should steal the student / young vote just on the basis of weed and no tuition fees alone.

Let's assume the amount of high-level radioactive waste produced by the UK in a year does not exceed the amount reported in 2013 ([2,900 tonnes](http://www.nda.gov.uk/ukinventory/documents/upload/2013-UK-Radioactive-Waste-Inventory-Waste-Quantities-from-all-Sources.pdf)) and that that's all we're interested in blasting off.

An [Ariane 5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5) rocket can carry a 21-tonne payload to low Earth orbit so if that's as far as they need to go then in order to dispose of all the high-level waste, we'd need 138 fully-laden launches a year (about one every two-and-a-half days). [This site](http://www.spaceflight101.com/ariane-5-eca.html) estimates the launch cost of an Ariane 5 at $120M, so per year, this program would cost a minimum of **£9.82bn**. For comparison, the NHS in England has a budget of [£95.6bn to deliver its mandate](http://www.england.nhs.uk/allocations-2013-14/).

So much for cost. What about safety? Over the last 15 years, there have only been [two failures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5#Notable_launches) of an Ariane 5 during a commercial flight, only one of which resulted in loss of the payload. To date there have been 69 commercial Ariane 5 flights, so let's assume (pessimistically) that the failure rate is 1/69.
Conveniently, that's exactly half the number of launches per year, so worst case scenario we can expect **two** of our waste packages (42 tonnes of waste) to fail to reach LEO every year.

So much for safety. What about emissions? In 1995, [this article](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/95JD01539/pdf) was published in Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres. For those who can't get through the paywall, the gist of the conclusion is this:

&gt;No significant global impact was calculated following an annual launch of 10 Ariane 5 rockets for 20 years. The maximum ozone loss [was] only 0.09%...

&gt;An even smaller impact was calculated from the long-term emission of water vapour from the rocket, the maximum ozone loss reaching only 0.0001%...

&gt;The model calculations indicate that Al2O3 particles released by Ariane rockets on a basis of 10 launches per year would produce 
global but very modest increases (~1%) in the stratospheric aerosol mass...

If we assume 138 launches per year, instead of 10, and the effects are linear, then the maximum possible ozone loss becomes **0.12%** and the increase in Al2O3 aerosols becomes **1.38%**. For reference, since the 1980s, the ozone loss has been about [20%](http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/ozone-depletion-overview/).",0,1400668190,null,0,false,0,chneacb,t3_260txb,t1_chneacb,t1_chnd3u2,null,1433890409,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I agree all things should matter. And that's pretty much my concern. I think we're in danger of ignoring a lot of other issues completely. I'm concerned people are forming their political alliances based on single issues. UKIP seem to be a single issue party more or less. Amidst all this EU and immigration talk, where is the talk about the economy, the education system, the housing market, energy policy, etc. UKIP seem to be gaining all their support based on a single issue and to hell with everything else. That worries me. I can't even find their manifesto. 

But those are all good points about the potential solutions. Nearly all of which we are already doing. And all of which I agree should be pursued even further if public opinion should require.

However, given various organisations really do love to use immigration as a political football, can immigration ever be brought to a palatable level? Will the anti-immigration press ever let the issue lie when it is such an easy way to stir controversy? And if it ever was reduced to a palatable level, would it be so draconian as to do irreparable damage to the economy?

And with regard to low skilled immigration, is it really worth risking hugely restricting our trading partners for the sake of a few bad eggs? The low skilled immigration is part of the EU. UKIP talks about leaving the EU, to secure our borders, and renegotiating free trade deals on an individual basis. What kind of free trade deals will hugely restrict the free movement of labour? Not a very effective one imo. Low skilled immigration does bring its issues, and there are a few bad eggs I agree. But  this immigration has been underway for a while now and it's hardly caused the apocalypse. The country is in reasonable shape. There are a few teething problems here and there that I completely agree should be addressed. I just can't help but feel that a draconian approach to immigration and multiculturalism, due to people not having the time or inclination (through no fault of their own) to wade through the misinformation and moral panics about the issue, could do irreparable damage to our economy and also further drive wedges between communities. I think it's fair to say that a large proportion of the public are misinformed about the issue. Time and time again surveys show that the general public vastly overestimate the number of immigrants in the country, what benefits they claim and so on. I don't think there could be any clearer indication of how the public thinks it's a much bigger issue than it really is.

The UK has always been an immigrant country - yes - but you only need to look at history to see what the immigrants did to the host country. The romans wiping out the bretons, the danes murdering half the country. 

The extermination of the bretons and celts, the complete eradication of Scottish gaelic, the suppression of Welsh and Cornish and the absolute removal of pagan culture - to be put in place by middle eastern culture, Christianity - a self hating religion which would teach gender sterotypes and the act of sex a sin that we still struggle to come to terms with to this day as a result.  

If you look at the Church gained footholds into the UK they did so because monks at the time, were the usually the ones keeping the records for who owned what houses etc. The Church had the power convert whole villages to the ownership of a particular lord merely by falsely providing papers ""proving"" that X lord owned this. 

Stewarts arguements support the average UKip voters fears. 

Let's be honest the UK is not a ""nation of immigrants"". It's a country that has seen ""immigrants"" murder the host country several times over in the space of the last millenia. His arguements don't work and from a historical perspective support UKips real or imagined fears.

Because we have no control over the price, nor supply. We will always come second in priority to the natives of whatever country we're importing from. 

We should be going all out on Nuclear like France did in the 70's, and stockpiling uranium ore as well. We should be doing everything in our power to be as self sufficient as we can be.

I was at both the Hull (Mourinho's first back) and PSG games this season and the whole stadium was loud, whereas during most games it's only the Matthew Harding and Shed.

The most common chants have usually been around since the 70s/ 80s, and most are based on popular/ famous songs. There are also chants that come and go with players. On how long it takes for a chant to become popular usually depends on how good it is, and if it's related to a player, how good that player is. You would usually only hear Kalou's chant if he scored, whereas Joe Cole's, Lampard's, Terry's were/ are common. 

Usually you just hear it around the ground a few times to learn it. There are also chants that you'll only ever hear at one game.

My point is that the school should provide whatever level they can to the less intelligent kids. However, there isn't an endless pool of cash to throw at private services with unproven track records. Regardless of how much money the government spend on education, there will always be a market for more lessons.

The government's concern is getting those children an acceptable level of education in the school. If that standard is being met, then people paying extra to get their kids more education is not a problem.

IMO, it's mad that more people don't care about our dependency on other nations for something as critical as energy. I think people take it for granted.

Maybe we should be doing that, but I don't think the issue is nearly as *urgent* as you made it seem. You said that it would be the *single* biggest issue in this century; that's surely hyperbolic.

&gt;Because fossil fuels are finite.

Completely agree, which is why we need renewables - uranium is likewise finite.

&gt; Possibly. But there's still the baseload problem to overcome.. You need a reliable source of electricity at the heart of your grid. You can't be wishing for the wind to blow. Tidal has promise in that respect. Still nowhere near enough to be the only solution, though.

Wind not blowing is only a problem if you haven't built enough wind farms with a high enough efficiency. If the wind dies down on the east coast for a day that's not necessarily a problem if it's working fine on the west and up north. Renewables have the potential to one day be the only source of energy - whether we'll see that in our life time, I doubt, but nuclear power is *at most* a stop-gap for us moving towards renewables.

Fuck this guy. He wanted to overtake the cyclist *in the fucking cycle lane* and barged past. Then starts haranguing the guy for having a phone in his hand, as if that was the cause of the collision. Even brings up the old anti-cyclist tropes about them not respecting the road, not stopping at lights etc - totally irrelevant to the situation and frankly hypocritical.

When I'm riding I make sure to respect the hell out of cyclists' space because as a fellow vulnerable road user I'm acutely aware of how much danger I could put them in by not doing so. I feel terrible for the cyclist in the video, first he gets knocked of his bike, then he has to deal with the policewoman telling him how wrong he is despite her clearly not having witnessed the event. If she had I would expect her to arrest the motorcyclist for dangerous driving.

I'm fuming and I could keep going but I'll put a lid on it because nobody is interested in pages and pages of my ranting.

*edit* fuck it, here are the relevant sections of the highway code:

----

**163**

**Overtake** only when it is safe and legal to do so. You should

* not get too close to the vehicle you intend to overtake
* only overtake on the left if the vehicle in front is signalling to turn right, and there is room to do so
* give motorcyclists, cyclists and horse riders at least as much room as you would when overtaking a car (see Rules 211 to 213 and 214 to 215).

**167**

**DO NOT** overtake where you might come into conflict with other road users. For example

* approaching or at a road junction on either side of the road
* when you would force another road user to swerve or slow down
* when a road user is indicating right, even if you believe the signal should have been cancelled. Do not take a risk; wait for the signal to be cancelled
* stay behind if you are following a cyclist approaching a roundabout or junction, and you intend to turn left

**170**

Take extra care at junctions. You should

* watch out for cyclists, motorcyclists, powered wheelchairs/mobility scooters and pedestrians as they are not always easy to see. Be aware that they may not have seen or heard you if you are approaching from behind


**204**

The most vulnerable road users are pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and horse riders. It is particularly important to be aware of children, older and disabled people, and learner and inexperienced drivers and riders.

**212**

When passing motorcyclists and cyclists, give them plenty of room (see Rules 162 to 167). If they look over their shoulder it could mean that they intend to pull out, turn right or change direction. Give them time and space to do so.

**213**

Motorcyclists and cyclists may suddenly need to avoid uneven road surfaces and obstacles such as drain covers or oily, wet or icy patches on the road. Give them plenty of room and pay particular attention to any sudden change of direction they may have to make.",0,1400670433,null,0,1400671893,0,chneoor,t3_263ps5,t1_chneoor,t3_263ps5,null,1433890597,15,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,15

its not an arbitrary number - its relative to recent history where people (and the main political parties) have recognised it was far too high (if for no other reason that it is unpopular). 

&gt; You don't think there's any danger whatsoever that immigration is being billed as a much bigger issue than it really is?

You are saying its not a big issue - but its the number one issue on the minds of the electorate. If politics is not supposed to focus on the concerns of the electorate then what the hell is it for? Just because you think there are other important things to worry about - that in your opinion (and quite frankly probably mine) are more important - doesn't change that fact.

&gt; And with regard to low skilled immigration, is it really worth risking hugely restricting our trading partners for the sake of a few bad eggs?

thats a false choice not being made here

&gt;  What kind of free trade deals will hugely restrict the free movement of labour? 

not sure, but i can't think of why freedom of movement is critical in trade deals - not my specialism. Doesn't seem to be a problem for Aus &amp; Canada though. FYI I think UKIP are the last people to trust this stuff to.

I don't see why a tougher stance on immigration is anti multicultural

&gt; I think it's fair to say that a large proportion of the public are misinformed about the issue. 

I totally disagree - i think its simply an issue of the country feeling uncomfortable with the rate of change in population. its gonna happen, just needs to be paced properly. this idea that people are ignorant is what pushes them to UKIP.

true,hungoverseal,null,null,"He was a really poor tactician and set the team up with absolutely no system whatsoever. It caused so many problems for us directly with other teams walking through our midfield and indirectly with it being partially responsible for our defenders making so many awful mistakes. Despite this he never took any responsibility for poor performances and instead came out and publicly slated the players week in week out.

His player management also seemed very strange. He talked in depth about needing players who would fight and perform for the club, yet froze out two of the most passionate and talented in Holtby and Sandro. The two players who's performance was by a million miles the abject worst in Rose and Lennon played nearly every game. He brought Bentaleb though the ranks early on which was applauded, but then played him over better midfielders which drove everyone crazy. Then when we really did need him towards the end of the season he dropped him to the bench again and played fucking wide men and attacking midfielders in the middle

And then there were some of the moronic things he said. We probably hired the guy because he knew the club and players inside out and we didn't really need much change from AVB, just someone who could get more creative players on the pitch and get the best out of them. Soon as he takes the job he then comes out and says 'I don't know these new players and I need people I can trust'. He hadn't even been paying fucking attention to who was in the first team and what the international superstars we signed were about. We brushed that quote off when he first took over but fuck me if that's not an indicament of someone not fit for the job I dont know what is. And then there was the whole 'defensive midfielders are the worst thing to happen to the premiership' thing which again is beyond belief and shows a lack of understanding of modern football.

Now to give the guy credit, he took over at a horrendous point in the season and did really well through a period with difficult games and terrible injuries. But when he did have the opportunity to take us on after that he showed he really didn't have a clue.

One of the schemes I applied to was hailed as the saviour of the industry. They were recruiting for 80 Physics jobs plus many other engineering, IT and support roles. At every stage of the application process it became clear just how much they'd overstated the support of the NDA (Nuclear Decommissioning Authority), energy firms, consultancies, defence contractors and other stakeholders. At first the 80 jobs dropped to 60, then 40. By the end of the recruitment process/assessment centre etc. they let on that there were actually only two physics placements. TWO! They were for the entire country for the year and they weren't even permanent posts - this from the scheme which was touted as revitalising the British nuclear economy.

Including UKIP and Nigel Farage themselves.

Personally, I don't like what I see of UKIP, and feel they are being used, and perhaps allowing themselves t be used, as a distraction from some of the more salient issues at hand. For example, why do they not bang on about [TTIP](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ttip-eu-us-prepare-enhance-global-corporatocracy-1449153)? That's surely a major threat to UK self-determination.

Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Intersex is what LGBTQI refer to. 

As someone who identifies with one of the LGBT+ terms, I do not appreciate when other (usually straight) people tell others what words they should/have to use to identify with. ""Man""/""Woman""/""Gay""/""Straight"" are not valid terms for some people and the best thing you can do is not question when someone prefers to identify with a term you perhaps haven't come across before. 

It is up to me as to which term I prefer, and it is not up to someone else to say ""can we not just be human"". It is very easy for a straight cisexual person to say ""ugh just be human what is with all these terms"" because you cannot comprehend what it is like to not be able to identify with binary terms of man or woman or of straight or gay. If someone else decides to use a term such as gender fluid for example, please respect that. It is sometimes hard enough to come to accept who you are without people jumping down your throat saying ""just be human"". 

That is why they use LGBTQI in their manifesto. I think the Greens have a good understanding of that and perhaps with a bit more insight others could do too.

We see this again with the Norman Invasion. The Norman lords were granted lands in England and a few English nobles took the rabbit punch, but the natives mostly kept themselves to themselves. The notable exceptions to this were the campaign of terror along the south coast by William's army, and the scouring of the North. Even so, the French didn't genetically supplant the Anglo-Saxons. Just culturally.

This was likewise probably the case with the Celtic Invasions (but it's difficult to tell, because no one wrote about them), the Roman Conquest and others.

But I do pay for it. I buy DVD's and BluRay, and if ever I get through that backlog, I will subscribe to Netflix or some other service. I actually haven't watched any BBC iPlayer or any other catchup service since I stopped paying the licence, so I don't partake in anything anybody produces without paying for it.

By paying for DVDs, I am actually contributing to the development of shows I enjoy more than you are through the licence. If anything, because you pay the licence, the BBC has carte blanche to make terrible content because it's what the masses want. Fair enough, I want no part of that.

Radio, not that I listen to that either, is also not covered by the licence.

I support the idea of a public service broadcaster, but I think that idea should stop beyond providing education and news.

true,Aygers,lfc99,,"Interesting article, some good points made. I agree Ashley Cole may offer a lot in terms of experience and he does seem to be exactly the type of player we were missing last season. It could be a delicate deal though, I'm sure he'll be asking for a lot of money and at least a two year deal. Not sure top brass at the club would offer that. He might get a similar deal as Kolo did though ... two years but AC would be on higher wages ... the point here is that there is precedent for 30+ players getting more than one year deals at Liverpool.

Williams is an interesting case. I don't think his age matters as much, as you have pointed out as well, however his on the ball quality doesn't really impress me. Agger is a lot better on the ball than 95% of defenders out there, has Champions League experience and is his national squad captain. I would much rather stick with him than look for an outside solution.

I agree with the point you made though ... one of the defenders will likely be sacrificed and given Sakho is also left footed and Skrtel had a very good season, Agger is the obvious chop. It's a shame we find ourselves in this situation and fact is we have more quality at the club than we are likely to obtain from the market. Maybe Agger or Sakho can develop their right feet over the summer to the extent this no longer an issue? Now there's some wishful thinking for you.

Will be on the look out for part two. One critique over part one is that you offer very little back up to your claims. Given the time you've taken, it'd be interesting to do some stats research and perhaps inspect a few more CBs and LBs for part one.

2. You must have insurance before you drive the car - if you want to test drive it at a dealership it will be covered by the dealer's insurance but it won't be covered if you want to test drive a private sale. 

You also need to pay road tax - you can pay for this at a post office or online (but not at the post office for much longer) and the price is based on the engine size of the vehicle and hence it's emissions. Some really really small-engined cars are exempt, but you must still get the disc (for now) to prove that you are exempt. At the moment you will be given a small disc that must be displayed in the lower passenger corner of the windscreen which proves you have paid, but the law is changing and soon it'll all be done online and you won't have to display anything. I'm not sure when that comes into effect though. 

Also, look out for clauses in the warranties offered by car dealerships - they might not cover what you expect them to if you decide to pay for an extended warranty.

A difference from the US is that the number plate (licence plate) stays with the vehicle not the owner (unless you have custom plates but that's different and generally expensive), so don't keep any old ones and expect one to come with the car. Tax discs are slightly confusing - they are still registered to the car, not the owner, but depending on how much is left of the period of validity, when you sell the car you can opt to reclaim some of the value, or you can leave it with the car, so some cars might come with tax discs and some might not. When you come to get one when you get the car, if you need one, you have to drive straight from the dealer's to a post office as you require the registration document (government form V5) *and a valid insurance certificate* to get the tax disc issued, and you are only exempt under the law as long as you are driving to get one. Once this all goes online, then I assume you would have to pay online as soon as you got the car home, but I'm not sure about that bit.

3. The MOT (Ministry of Transport) test, identified by [this symbol](http://www.motmot.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MOT_LOGO-300x300.jpg) outside accredited test stations, is a test to make sure the vehicle is still roadworthy and safe to use. It must be completed yearly once the vehicle is three years old, and the majority of the tests relate to basic things that you should be looking at as a responsible car owner anyway - things like do the tyres still have the legal tread minimum left (1.6mm across the centre 3/4 of the tyre), are the tyre walls bulging, are your fluids all correct, are your windscreen wipers in decent condition, that sort of thing.

The test does go more in-depth though - the status of the brakes will be tested (I.E. do you need new pads or discs, are all the brakes compressing equally etc), and the vehicle will be inspected for rust, damage to seatbelts and other safety equipment, and if the car has a computer port they will likely connect and get a fault report from the car to see if there is anything else wrong. 

They will also perform an emissions test on the car to see if the engine is producing more emissions than it should be. The good news is that there is a margin based on what the manufacturer said a new engine should be producing, and as long as the emissions level doesn't go outside of that band you're OK.

A decent test place should charge £45-80 for this test. If something fails, ~~then the garage legally can't let the car leave under it's own steam and you must either decide to pay to have the faults rectified (either at that garage or at another one if the car is removed on a transporter)~~ EDIT: then you can only legally drive it to a place where it's booked in to be repaired, or to another MOT appointment if you've fixed it yourself, or you can opt to scrap the car then and there.

A lot of the time you can ask your car dealer to do the MOT at the same time as a car service, if one becomes necessary at around the same time, as this saves the garage time and money, and you get both events combined into a single day where you are without your car, rather than two days.

Also, when purchasing a car, a good question to ask is how long the MOT is valid for on it, and you can ask to see the previous MOT reports, if the car has them - some people don't hand them over when selling the car and some dealers bin them if they're not good, and there's no legal requirement to pass them on. But if the dealer has them they are a good record to see what's happened to the car in the past, if it's failed before, why it's failed etc. So you can see that if the car has had rust repairs two or three years in a row it's likely to fail again this time, and that could be major corrective work.

4. Decent car - one of my friends had one and he said it was reliable and fairly cheap to run. I don't think you'll go much wrong with one of these, as long as you buy a decent one in the first place.

5. try [autotrader.co.uk](http://www.autotrader.co.uk) or if you're going to a dealer most of them have their own websites now with stock etc on.

Again this suggest something very sudden, perhaps two crew in the cockpit (beacons) and two down below. Not all PLBs/EPIRBs are GPS-assisted, all emit a powerful signal on 406Mhz which itself has a rough accuracy of 2km in ideal conditions and it can take a while to triangulate, more modern ones encode a GPS fix into the signal for a more accurate location. I don't know which they had. PLB battery life is a minimum of 24 hours, the search was 50+ so unlikely they are still transmitting.
3. Unknow to me at least, although I have read that despite the youth of the captain he was an excellent sailor with enough experience for the job.
4. I have lived on yachts and sometimes water will just appear from nowhere. There is almost always some water in the bilges from one or another leaky seal, through-hull fitting etc - in this case I suspect the keel might have been coming away from the hull. I am not sure if this is possible to visually confirm from inside the hull. Certainly the guys will have been trying to identify the problem but if the pumps are keeping up and there is not an imminent danger of sinking, it's not an emergency just yet.
5. They apparently had a 12-man liferaft on board which is stored in the cockpit under the helmsman's seat. This is a big raft, and deploying it in heavy weather would have been a real trial. The simultaneous activation of two PLBs (not the EPIRB) suggests two crew suddenly in the sea, beacons automatically activated by contact with water. They simply may not have had time, and if the yacht had turned turtle getting to the liferaft to deploy it (underwater) would have been super difficult if not just impossible.

I sadly suspect that two crew were in the cockpit, were thrown into the sea and have perished from exposure, and two crew were trapped or killed inside the hull. Having said that nobody knows, if they deployed the liferaft then they could still be hanging on.",0,1400675612,null,0,1400681340,0,chnfvam,t3_25uzh7,t1_chnfvam,t1_chlqo6f,null,1433891155,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But it does look like the naming is getting our of hand.

When I was going through university in the early 1990s they used the word ""queer"" or ""gay"" for the most part. Then that changed and it became lesbian and gay. Then bisexual. Then transgender got thrown into the mix. Then queer made a recurrence. And now ""intersex"". 

You are more than welcome to call yourself whatever you want, but it's damn confusing for everyone else if the name keeps changing every few years in order to accommodate every single sexual identity. Can it ever end?

The term is what is presented to the non-LGBT community in order to represent yourselves so look at it in terms of public relations. If you're in a sexual identity/confusion minority, you're already at a disadvantage. Changing the name doesn't help the public/majority relations side of things if all they (we) see is confusion.

I say this to help, not to hassle.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;I actually haven't watched any BBC iPlayer or any other catchup service since I stopped paying the licence, so I don't partake in anything anybody produces without paying for it

Hence my comment about it *not* being a pay-as-you-use service. 

&gt;If anything, because you pay the licence, the BBC has carte blanche to make terrible content because it's what the masses want. Fair enough, I want no part of that.

That's because they're making content for everyone, not just you. And again, it's not pay-as-you-go.

&gt;I support the idea of a public service broadcaster, but I think that idea should stop beyond providing education and news.

The scope is a lot, lot broader than that. For example, Cbeebies - no adverts, no product tie-ins, and a website that's design to teach kids how to point 'n' click with a bonus of making it hard for them to accidentally end up on another website. Do I use this service? No - but I'm happy it exists when the alternative is Disney channel that ensures kids hassle their parents for £400 consoles whether they have the money or not.

&gt;unlike the BBC, which is part funded by the government because of those free elderly licences.

The Beeb have a much, much more independent agenda than, say, Sky. And they have no adverts, which makes the service unique.

&gt;You have a problem with people doing things that are completely legal. 

No, as I said before - I have a problem with people exploiting loopholes to pretend they're doing nothing wrong. We've ended up with this tax-avoiding fiasco because of people doing stuff that's 'completely legal'.

&gt;then perhaps you should write to your MP and complain that people aren't living their lives the way you think they should live them?

Sure, it's not 'paying a small fee so that everyone benefits' in the manner that the vast majority do already, it's forcing people to 'live their lives the way one person thinks they should'.

&gt;In my mind, the largest threat to the BBC, is its ""supporters"" who think nothing should ever change.

However, the problem I see here is that you are failing to understand that we are not arguing that the Anglo-Saxons were peaceful, rather that they were in many times violent, but ultimately they were an elite ruling class imposing their culture and language on the natives.

Just like how the Normans linguistically influenced English massively (without affecting the native *population*), the Anglo-Saxon migrants culturally and linguistically influenced English without changing the genetic stock of the population.

Evidence for this? Study of Y-DNA haplogroups in Europe have shown that the[population of the UK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R1b) is overwhelimngly of the R1b haplogroup, just like most of Western Europe - but unlike Germany.

[Dad](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dad&amp;allowed_in_frame=0) is interesting. I didn't know this but maybe it is from Brythonic.

[Crock](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=crock&amp;allowed_in_frame=0) is close to the Irish so definitely a contender, but it is prevalent in every Germanic language so maybe not via Brythonic integration.

[Hubbub](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hubbub&amp;allowed_in_frame=0) comes from 1500s Irish. Presumably during the times they were being conquered by the English, so it doesnt really count as being inherited from Brythonic speakers.

Honestly though I don't think these historical examples are justification for UKIP's views either.

- Lallana's played well under two managers with different systems at Southampton over 2 PL seasons, and impressed on his England debut. Adam had 1 season in the PL under one manager in one style of play. Which is more likely to be the one season wonder?

- Adam had the Blackpool team built around him entirely - two other midfielders did all the defending and the running so Charlie could just stand and reel off passes. Southampton aren't built around Lallana, and nobody's carrying his slack - he presses as much as anyone despite being an attacking midfielder.

- Adam's a limited player - CM only, with one great strength in long-range passing, good set pieces and a good shot. But he can't cover ground, can't tackle, can have a poor touch, can't play a patient probing possession game. Lallana's a much more complete player, plays multiple positions, and is technically gifted too.

- Adam's not an intelligent player either - he attempts even more Hollywood balls than rival fans and detractors accuse Gerrard of attempting. See above about him not being able to play a possession game. Lallana's versatility shows his game intelligence, as do his performances under Adkins and Pochettino's different styles, plus his seamless step up to international football - a reason, along with his captaincy of Southampton, why I think he won't be overawed by being at Liverpool.",0,1400677315,null,0,false,0,chngd7f,t3_263prh,t1_chngd7f,t1_chnftqc,null,1433891390,11,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,11

true,awkg,null,null,"When someone mentions an obscure job title or medical condition or hobby they have, people tend to just accept it rather than getting annoyed that they haven't heard the word before and insisting that the person uses a more generic term instead.  I really think the suspicion lots of people have when they encounter words to do with LGBT people is largely down to prejudice.

&gt; When I was going through university in the early 1990s they used the word ""queer"" or ""gay"" for the most part. Then that changed and it became lesbian and gay

Obviously ""queer"" used to mean something like ""strange"", then it became popular as a homophobic slur, and now it's caught on in many places as a generic term for LGBT people.  Given that all those meanings are still used to some extent, it's a bit problematic.  Nowadays ""gay"" means ""attracted only or mostly to people of the same gender"", and ""lesbian"" is a term meaning ""gay woman"" that has been in use since the late 19th century, and is a reference to the ancient Greek poet Sappho of Lesbos, who is widely thought to have been a lesbian.

&gt; Then bisexual.

Obviously this means ""attracted to both men and women"", and again it seems to have appeared in the late 19th century.

&gt; Then transgender got thrown into the mix.

This word is actually pretty modern, but it goes back to the 80s at least.  It describes someone whose gender identity does not match the sex they were raised as.

&gt; And now ""intersex"". 

This has apparently been in use since 1917, and describes people with medical conditions that cause them to have some physiological characteristics typical of men, and some typical of women.

Every single one of these words has a distinct meaning and all have been in use for longer than you seem to think.  Most of them describe concepts that are undeniably useful.

&gt; Changing the name doesn't help the public/majority relations side of things if all they (we) see is confusion.

Language changes naturally - there's very little we can do to stop it even if we want to (look at the Académie française).  It maybe changes a little faster in this area because we are in the process of getting rid of taboos that prevent us from talking about non-normative genders and sexualities, and because the whole field of studying human sexuality is pretty new.  You also sometimes get ""euphemism treadmill"" effects, where a word acquires such negative connotations that people purposefully avoid using it with its prior meaning (think ""cretin"", ""retarded"", ""lame"", etc.).",0,1400677744,null,0,false,0,chnghzq,t3_263nba,t1_chnghzq,t1_chnfzg5,null,1433891462,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

We know that by 876, they had started to settle down and even began farming to support themselves. Although the initial plan was to conquer all four of the English kingdoms (Wessex, Mercia, Northumberland and East Anglia) the invasion faltered and they had to make do with considerably less.

In 884, Alfred the Great signed a treaty with the Viking King Guthrum, where Alfred and his dependants would rule the South and West of England whilst Guthrum and his dependants would rule the North and East.

After the peace, there is evidence that there was a fair amount of Viking migration, but that this was largely contained to only a few regions.

This is suggested by the presence of particular Y-chromosome haplotypes found in regions known to have been heavily-colonised by the Vikings, such as Orkney, Cumbria, Anglesey and northern Russia. Said haplotypes are *not* commonly found in other parts of the UK. **So the implication is that the majority of territory even under the Danelaw was in fact populated by subjugated Britons rather than Viking immigrants.**

I don't think you understand how big football is here, and in most of Europe and South America for that matter. In America you have four major sports which are probably on a similar level of popularity. We have lots of sports that are popular here too, but football is far and away the most popular. Just to give you an idea, the total attendance for this season of the Premier League (football) was nearly 14 million. For the rugby union Premiership the total attendance was 1.6 million - rugby union is very popular in the south and parts of the midlands, and is a contender for our second most popular sport, but as you can see from the figures it just can't compete with football.",0,1400678439,null,0,false,0,chngqd8,t3_263mrv,t1_chngqd8,t3_263mrv,null,1433891571,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7

How can any institution even partially government funded be independent? We know Sky, Channel 5, 4, 3, all have their agendas, they wear it on their sleeves. It's a little more subversive with the BBC because it isn't independent any longer, and yet everybody believes everything it says, because of its protected status. The same way the elderly get duped by mail fraud because it's delivered by ""Royal Mail"", and surely they wouldn't let anything bad happen to them.

&gt;I have a problem with people exploiting loopholes to pretend they're doing nothing wrong.

It's not a loop hole: It's law. I and most others abide by it. What it comes down to is you disagreeing with a lifestyle choice, and that's fine, you can disagree, but don't pretend the law is on your side, because it isn't. If you think the law should be changed, petition government.

All this is academic, really. You think the BBC should be protected, and it should be a public service. I disagree, it should be reduced to the bare objective necessities, leaving everything else to be purchased by the individual.
