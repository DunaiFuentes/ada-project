true,ctp95,lfc55,,"I support Celtic as well as Liverpool and one of my most enduring and worst memories in sport is Mourinho running around like a prat on the touchline after Porto beat us in the 2003 UEFA Cup final. He's forever linked with one of the most bitter disappointments in Celtic's history. He is tactically near-unparalleled but he's not as good or as clever as he thinks. The pathetic deference that the British media display towards him has been unbearable this season and he leaves nothing but bitterness and disorder in his wake, just look at Real last season.

I know we're supposed to hate them but United is much more like Liverpool than we care to admit. Yeah, they buy superstars and have a lot of ""plastic"" supporters, but there is a true community in Manchester pulling for them and the success they had under SAF was undeniably something special. Chelsea, in my opinion, stand for nothing but greed, arrogance, stupid amounts of money and a really unpalatable right-wing slant amongst their support base. I just spent a year living in Wandsworth, about a mile from their ground and weaving through their ""support"" on home days was incredibly unpleasant. Their time-wasting and cheating begins and ends with Mourinho. The other night against West Brom Gary Cahill took a knock to the leg and took five minutes off the pitch, but then a Baggies player goes down and Azipilicueta is trying to drag him off the turf? Fuck off with Mourinho, Abramovich and that horrific sense of entitlement.

&gt;A Recoverable Hardship Payment is an additional payment of Universal Credit, not a part of the claimant’s entitlement. This means that once a person’s Universal Credit award is no longer subject to penalty or sanction 
any sum paid as hardship is subject to repayment. 
 
&gt;A hardship payment in Jobseeker's Allowance or Employment and Support Allowance is not subject to repayment. 
 
&gt;Crisis Loans and Community Care Grants, which formed the discretionary Social Fund, were abolished in April 2013.

So, 1) Crisis Loans are a separate system from Hardship Payments; 2) Hardship Payments *are not repayable* (incidentally they never have been) and 3) the new Recoverable Hardship Payment is, well, recoverable.

When Ramos came in, we were in 18th place with 7 points from 10 games. Not quite the 2 points 8 games story you hear from Redknapp all the time, but definitely a poor start to the season. Ramos brought us back into mid-table and focused more on the cups, since obviously we weren't about to win the league or qualify for Europe with that kind of a start. In that League Cup we beat Arsenal 5-1 and Chelsea 2-1. I started following Spurs a year or two before that and it was the first silverware I watched us win (on a terrible quality stream, as I don't live in England and coverage of football at the time was pretty rare in the US).

After we won the cup, it was clear the squad checked out early, once we were safe and stranded in mid-table. The performances for the rest of the season were underwhelming, but we had a trophy for the first time since 1999.

The start to the next season was terrible, both on the pitch and off. Off the pitch, we sold my then-favorite player, Berbatov, as well as Keane and Kaboul (who we obviously bought back eventually). There was a lot of hope, with the signings of Modric, dos Santos, Bentley, and Pavlyuchenko, but ultimately the team failed to perform and Ramos was sacked after some dreadful performances.

As he points out in that article, there was heavy investment in January to fix some of the issues with the squad. Arguably, there are parallels between the sackings of AVB and Ramos, both of whom were tasked with rebuilding a team shorn of its best and player (Berbatov/Bale).",0,1392337037,null,0,1392347290,0,cfert80,t3_1xuc09,t1_cfert80,t1_cfepnu5,null,1432387867,12,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,12

The other thing is that Rodgers really likes to tinker with his squad and players tactically. Not only have we seen all kinds of starting formations, players are shifted around or given different tasks in every game. Perhaps what has had an affect on Aly's performances as well was the realization of Rodgers, that there is just no way he can use him in a similar fashion as Enrique. Instead he's given him a different role and instructions.

Either way this raises another point. While on paper the team really is short of depth, Rodgers' tactical acumen is really making up for some of the flaws of our squad.

Criticised by who? It sounds like an excuse to recycle content - each paper is quite capable of researching the same story to back up *their own* take on things, and in any case aren't tabloids fully acknowledging what they missed by citing the source newspaper anyway?

&gt;The MP's expenses story was broken by the Telegraph, can you imagine what would happen if nobody else had reported on it?

Well, there's the difference between 'we spoke to' and 'according to the Daiily Telegraph'. Nothing wrong with doing your own research, but you don't seem to be appreciating the difference between reporting on the same story and just repeating what another paper has already printed.

&gt;Or the NotW phone tapping, what if the Guardian had been the only paper to cover that? There would have been no pressure to change anything.

As above, with the added bonus of 'Why weren't they investigating *each other*? Piers Morgan, amongst others, has made it obvious that other papers were doing the same thing. Why hasn't there been more pressure on that front?

Delivering Quality First is a BBC Trust approved euphemism for 'brutal, ham-fisted budget cuts necessitated by the Coalition Government cutting the funding in real terms'. DQF initiatives prevent the BBC from spending the kind of money a more sensible '12 full episodes' run would cost. Because of the format and production schedule, (more than) doubling the order to 12 episodes would increase the number of people necessary to produce a season.

(WeeklyWipe is produced by a comically small production team by US standards)

British Brevity - as well as inconsistent season lengths and bizarre, unpredictable premiere dates are largely related to the smaller pool of resources available to British broadcasters, considering the breadth of networks (United Kingdom has four Networks spread across five main channels, with an additional nine entertainment channels also operated by those four main networks, all of whom are also jockeying for attention and staff against Sky - who fill the role of HBO, in addition to operating a smorgasbord of channels roughly analogous to those found on Basic Cable in the US)

Essentially, we're a much smaller industry producing content for a disproportionately large number of channels and networks, with correspondingly disproportionately small sacks of money to throw at things (except Sky, who are minted, but shell out quite a lot on acquired content). As such, a lot gets done on a smaller scale. Our equivalents to The Tonight Show, for example, are all weekly and are commissioned in batches of usually around 13 episodes (Though ITV has been known to prolong the run of The Jonathan Ross Show north of 20, seemingly on a whim), and go off the air for up to 2-3 months between batches (irritatingly referred to as 'Seasons' despite there frequently being two premiered in one calendar year).",0,1392340672,null,0,false,0,cfetfu0,t3_1xt28w,t1_cfetfu0,t3_1xt28w,null,1432388636,3,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,3

The only way for us to deal with drugs as a sensible, adult society is to legalise, tax and educate. 

Legalise drugs so that we stop imprisoning, criminalising and dehumanising our children - destroying lives for an ideological cause that makes no sense (drugs destroy your life. If we find you doing them, WE will destroy your life). 
Tax, using the income generated, as well as a small part of the billions currently being spent imprisoning people to treat drug related illness, rehabilitation, and meaningful non-condescending education about drugs. 
This education should be about what the drugs are, how they are made, how to take them safely, what potential dangers they have, how to deal with freak-outs, what to say to healthcare workers if you fall ill, where you can get help for addiction, and what positive sides there are to safe, responsible drug taking. 

Legalisation also means better quality, purer drugs which are safer than the rat-poison you could buy from some bloke in a club, and also cheaper, meaning that people will have to rely less on crime to feed their addiction. Couple with this with easier to access, and cheaper rehabilitation clinics which are no longer as demonised by society, and you've got a recipe for heathier, happier, better educated people.

People are going to do drugs whether or not they are illegal. Criminalising them doesn't help.

Only three kinds of people really want drugs to remain illegal: politicians, who can always use it as a fall-back dog-whistle topic to stir up some moral outrage and gain support, law enforcement whose job relies on drugs being illegal, and drug dealers for the same reason.

It's not quite that simple. Firstly, Scotland isn't a region it's a country. Secondly, the act of union was between Scotland and England to form the United Kingdom. By dissolving that union, the rest of the UK exists in a new form, and would require a new act of union to cement it.

&gt;The rest of the UK would be the successor state and continue as before, with all institutions remaining.

It's fairly clear that rUK would be the successor state in international terms, however that doesn't mean Scotland leaves with nothing. Scotland has a right to the pound just as much as any other UK country does.

Why not just build a fuckton of ~~social~~ housing? If you build enough then it will become generally affordable. Conversely, if you need to build social housing, then that's proof that demand exceeds supply and someone is still getting screwed. Social housing just masks the problem.

I can't speak for other places, like Brighton (where by the sounds of it there is a genuine geographical problem). But in London, where the problem is by far the worst, there's no shortage of private companies willing to build houses. There's just a shortage of land to build them on. If this were released and properties simply built and sold at market rates, the problem would be solved.

(I exaggerate slightly. I'm not saying that social housing is *never* needed. The original post seems like a great idea and something like this will always be needed. But it's not the core problem.)",0,1392343392,null,0,false,0,cfeulvq,t3_1xtome,t1_cfeulvq,t1_cfesdcp,null,1432389186,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

So winning EL as well as getting 4th would show that this club is prepared for UEFA competition as well as competing to stay in a CL spot.

Plus having another piece of silverware is more valuable to having the chance to get a piece of silverware.

&gt; What's the difference between racial abuse and general abuse? Why is abusing somebody for the colour of their skin or their ethnicity considered worse than abusing somebody for any other factor? I have my opinion as to why it is, but how do you legislate that fairly into our legal system? You simply cannot.

I could cite several reasons, but I think the primary one is to deter prejudice. That's kind-of an important thing in a progressive society.

&gt; Sending people to prison for saying things *you* do not like is not progressive.

Your emphasis on 'you' is odd. You do realise that it isn't my idea, don't you? But, anyway, it's not about me, it's about the victims, and you'll find it pretty much the norm for British law to punish people who do stuff against others. 

&gt; Is that the case in the US? No. We don't require these kind of laws to be civil to one another.

I don't know what you mean here. Are you trying to say that the US doesn't have anti-racism laws, and it gets on fine without them? If you are then I find that odd, since the US *does* have them, and things like the Civil Rights Act were what banned the widespread practise of sending blacks to the back of the bus.

Of you want a less academic reference by Adam Curtis that is available [online](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/posts/BUGGER), I attach an extract because it is both funny and somewhat sad: 

&gt;Le Queux had started off as a journalist on the Daily Mail - but then had travelled around Europe getting to know lots of famous and infamous people. But as he did so he became convinced that many of the European countries, but most of all Germany, envied Britain and wanted to get their hands on the wealth of the Empire.

&gt;The trouble was that the British people didn't realise this. So Le Queux set out to warn them - above all by telling them that the Germans were sending spies to Britain to prepare for an invasion.
Le Quex Spies 1

&gt;But the ruling classes in Britain laughed at Le Queux. They said it was just fiction - which it was. Plus he wasn't really British and he hadn't been to a proper school, he was far too vulgar and insistent in his patriotism. In short he was a bore.

&gt;So Le Queux did what anyone in their right mind would do in such a situation. He turned to the Daily Mail.

&gt;He wrote a gripping account of a future German invasion of Britain and took it to Lord Northcliffe who ran the Mail. It was called ""The Invasion of 1910"" and it described how the Germans landed in East Anglia and marched on London.

&gt;Northcliffe loved it - but the Mail's circulation department said that many of the towns on Le Queux's invasion route didn't have many actual or potential Daily Mail readers in them.

&gt;So Lord Northcliffe changed the route of the invasion to make sure that all the towns that were sacked and pillaged had lots of Daily Mail readers.

Anyway, a fuss was raised, DM readers wrote letters about the spes they saw everywhere and questions were asked in parliament:

&gt;Then things started getting out of control. Thousands of Daily Mail readers sent Le Queux letters telling him that they had spotted people acting suspiciously - which meant they must be German spies.

&gt;The letters were mirror images of what Le Queux had written in his books. But rather than making him suspicious, Le Queux decided that this proved that what he had written as fiction must actually be true. There was a gigantic German spy ring in Britain.

&gt;Thousands of Daily Mail readers couldn't be wrong.

&gt;The man whose job it was to uncover spies in Britain was very excited by all this. He was called Colonel Edmonds. He had a tiny budget and two assistants - and noone on the General Staff bothered with him.

&gt;But now Col. Edmonds saw his chance. He teamed up with Le Queux and together they bombarded the Committee for Imperial Defence with the evidence from the Daily Mail readers. Edmonds said that the government should set up a ""secret service bureau"" to combat the threat.

&gt;The head of the Committee - Lord Haldane - said this was ridiculous. But even he couldn't stand against the wave of spy fever that was sweeping the country. He gave in - and MI5 was set up - created in large part by the dreams of a socially excluded novelist, and the paranoid imaginings of the readers of the Daily Mail.

true,insoundfromwayout,null,null,"Well, it's not a workable approach. I'm going to try to explain in the style of 'Explain Like I'm 5'.

Imagine you are in Singapore, and you work very high up in a bank, and you are in charge of looking after a *trillion* dollars. And your only job is to keep an eye on the money, and make sure that when the people come back to get it, that it is still worth a trillion dollars. You can't just leave it in big pallet-loads of cash in the basement, because cash slowly goes down in value (remember when you could buy a Fredo for 5p?). So you are going to have to buy things, invest in things, a lot of things - things that are stable, things that are secure, things that won't go down in value.

Now, you don't give a *fuck* what the things are. You are not trying to make friends, you are not a romantic, you are not trying to invest in 'good' or 'promising' things. You just need your money safe. You don't care if it is tied up in the motorway systems of France, in a South African slave driven diamond mine, in a Korean property conglomerate or the infrastructure of a corrupt third world dictatorship. ALL you care about is stability - your money remaining the same value - you ask yourself only one question ""If I put my money into this, will I be able to get it back out again?""

And every day, people hand you sheets of paper. The sheets say ""Do you want to invest in _______"" and then follows a list of ALL the things that that company, or country, or industry, or whatever, has ever done. This is it's economic history. Like a job reference, it tells you how the company has performed in the past, what it has done, how it has done it, and you use that information to judge, with all your skill and experience, if this place would be a good place to put your trillion dollars. This is your job.

So someone might hand you a piece of paper that say ""Do you want to invest in CINCO HEAVY INDUSTRIES"" and then will follow a big list of all the things the company has done. It says that they make money each year, have always paid their debts, have grown slightly year on year, operate in stable countries, and so on and so on. And you judge based on this financial report.

So one day, you take a piece of paper from your pile of paper, and you look at it and it's about a new faraway foreign country called Scotland. And because Scotland is a brand new country that doesn't have any independent track record, there is nothing much on that sheet of paper. In fact, there is only *one* thing - the only thing that Scotland has so far done in their entire economic history since declaring independence. So the paper has at the top ""Do you want to invest in SCOTLAND?"" and then is entirely blank aside from the one line that reads ""THEY WERE LENT 2.6 TRILLION DOLLARS, AND THEY DID NOT PAY IT BACK""

Now, remember, you don't give a *fuck* about freedom, or democracy, or how nice an idea an Independent Scotland might be, or how friendly the people are, or the rolling green hills of the highlands - you are in an office building in Singapore with an electric fan blowing on your face, and this single sheet of paper with which to decide if you want to put your money there. And also on your desk is a HUGE pile of other pieces of paper, other places you could put your money.

You are not going to put your money there. No one is going to put their money there. Scotland would find it very hard to find anyone to lend them money. The only way they could persuade people to invest would be to offer a really high return on the money. I mean, *really* high. How high would it have to be, for you to actually say 'yes' to that piece of paper, rather than just reach for the next one?

And remember, in your scenario, this young Scotland has no diplomatic network, no military, no currency reserves, no pension reserves, no national art collections, and so on. So it's going to need to buy all of these. This is exactly the kind of thing they want the investment for. 

So they either have to chose between going without a diplomatic network (!), or borrowing money at an *insanely* high price to build one immediately. And this will be true for everything the country does. They either go without a military for a year, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, until they can afford one, or they build one right now at an astronomical price, much much more than what it is really worth, because of the interest.

&gt;**Pareidolia** (/pærɨˈdoʊliə/ parr-i-**DOH**-lee-ə) is a psychological phenomenon involving a vague and random [stimulus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulation) (often an image or sound) being perceived as [significant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_(semiotics\)), a form of [apophenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia). Common examples include seeing images of animals or faces in clouds, the [man in the moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_in_the_moon) or the [Moon rabbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rabbit), and hearing [hidden messages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_message) on [records](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record) when played in reverse.

&gt;The word comes from the [Greek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language) words para (παρά, ""beside, alongside, instead"") in this context meaning something faulty, wrong, instead of; and the noun [eidōlon](http://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B5%E1%BC%B4%CE%B4%CF%89%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%BD) (εἴδωλον ""image, form, shape"") the diminutive of eidos. Pareidolia is a type of [apophenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia), seeing patterns in random data.

true,port53,cnty-expat,Expat in US,"The problem with this is that we'll always have young people/first time buyers so you'd have to keep this program up forever, which isn't particularly sustainable.  The money has to come from somewhere.  Someone already owns the land those houses are going to be built on.  I wouldn't advocate the government taking people's land by force so it can be turned over to a developer to make more housing.

I grew up in council housing, my parents rented (for fairly cheap) for ~25 years.  At that point the council decided to sell off a large number of their houses and offered it to my mum for pretty cheap (they took in to account the long years of renting.)  At that point, whilst still being a true first time buyer, she was plenty established in life and was able to flip it for a nice sum and move somewhere nicer.  That house is no longer available to people who will need somewhere affordable to rent in the future because the council decided to turn it in to a cheap affordable home for a first time buyer.  There's no way they can build a house today and have it cost them less than money they made selling the one that had been paid for a long time ago.

Renting keeps the properties in the pool for the future, selling of subsidizing cheap sales just seems, to me, to be a short term gain that will cause long term problems.  If the rent is low enough people can still save to buy, but you can't force everyone to stop renting, not everyone even wants to stop renting.

I don't think renting from the government where the ""profits"" of the program go back in to the program to keep rents low and to create future properties is such a bad thing.  I don't think putting people in to houses they can't afford to maintain, or giving people houses for cheap that they can then flip and make a profit on (at the tax payer's expense) is a good thing either\*.

But it is definitely a time investment--you really need to know your ""memory palace"" like the back of your hand, so once you run out of routes you know by rote you'll have to concentrate to create new ones.  There are pros and cons to that--if you enjoy museums and architecture, it might be a thrill to physically memorize a new place through and through. (Of course, you don't HAVE to use physical places.)  Plus, they won't stick in your memory forever without revisiting them occasionally so you can't keep your internal library of infamous Shakespearean monologues on hand very easily.
  
And, the second part to it is that to find what imagery works best will be a bit of personal trial-and-error. When I first read about what some other people used, I was a bit turned off by the technique because of how poorly their ""vivid imagery"" would be to me, personally:

&gt; Inside the front door, the Incredible Hulk rode a stationary bike while a pair of oversize, loopy earrings weighed down his earlobes (three of clubs, seven of diamonds, jack of spades). Next to the mirror at the bottom of the stairs, Terry Bradshaw balanced on a wheelchair (seven of hearts, nine of diamonds, eight of hearts), and just behind him, a midget jockey in a sombrero parachuted from an airplane with an umbrella (seven of spades, eight of diamonds, four of clubs). I saw Jerry Seinfeld sprawled out bleeding on the hood of a Lamborghini in the hallway (five of hearts, ace of diamonds, jack of hearts), and at the foot of my parents’ bedroom door, I saw myself moonwalking with Einstein (four of spades, king of hearts, three of diamonds).

Notice how my example was quite a bit different and simpler, even? Admittedly when you do figure out what type of fun, quirky stuff you can create on your own (and on-the-fly) to represent things you want to memorize, it's terribly effective.

Yes they don't have full parity but mostly it is live and let live. Homosexuality in Russia is  viewed as uncommon, but when it is still a very very small section of the population why shouldn't it be? As a minority in Russia the LGBT community is extremely vocal though, enough to whip up a worldwide frenzy over some of the very pragmatic attempts to limit western influences in a global context. It is clear when you see laws banning foreign adoption of Russian children into non typical families they are very concerned about the reach of western influence into their country. 

I can well see where they are coming from. I personally think for all our attempts at trying to appease everybody's feelings  we have ended up with a society that is so totally fragmented that no one feels any empathy with anyone else. We have become a society of tribes. If you don't belong or affiliate yourself with this group or that you are now the enemy.

I can be more concise if it was the length of my post that you didn't like:

Declaring independence, defaulting on £1.6 trillion of debt, and then immediately needing to seek investment in order to build an entire infrastructure to replace the one you just declared independence from is an *unworkable* idea, because the country would be forced to decide between going without vital infrastructure (impossible) or borrowing massive amounts at astronomical interest rates to pay for it all (unworkable).

Hello? Ignoring the fact that your comment smacks of that 'What if we're wrong and we create a better world for nothing?' cartoon, If we do nothing, there's going to a much larger (and more importantly *permanent*) detriment to the economy and population in the future.

Also, what, so you're saying we should give in to apathy and Tragedy of the Commons? That's self-destructive.

Perhaps emerging economies would be more likely to pursue greener measures if we weren't such hypocrites in our judgement? Saying ""Oh you've got to stop polluting, but not *us*, we have a *right* to keep polluting in the pursuit of short-term profits"" is ridiculous on so many levels.

It doesn't mean that every white person will secure their heart's desire, join the boardroom and become rich (even if that were every white person's desire), nor does it mean that every black person has no chance of success, wealth, and membership of the other most exclusive clubs in the country, it merely means that at every step of the way, the white person will have an inbuilt advantage because of their skin colour.  And, frankly, the evidence for this is overwhelming in pretty much any category you care to examine objectively - criminal justice, the job market, share ownership, promotions, company hierarchies, networking opportunities, school exclusion rates, university admissions/grades, etc.  And, despite some people's beliefs to the contrary, this is not addressed, still less reversed, by equality legislation.  Should we feel guilty about our white privilege? No, of course not, that makes no sense, but we should at least acknowledge it and take some responsibility for it.

Edit:  Just to address your specific point.  Does your experience of white privilege mean that you should always sit down and shut up when a black person is speaking about their experience of prejudice?  No, I don't think it does.  But it does mean that you should default to listening very carefully to what they say, you should ""check your privilege"", because they're talking about something you have never experienced, whereas they experience it every single day of their lives.",0,1392378643,null,0,1392379348,0,cff4fly,t3_1xtyz0,t1_cff4fly,t1_cff325d,null,1432393934,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It shows how the workers are exploited by the idle rich using The Money Trick, and how the only remedy to this is tearing down the Capitalist system and enacting a Socialist utopia.

Anyway, the main character of the novel makes the point that, as there is a huge surplus of workers and so any man who protests against his situation can be replaced instantly, they are in a sense worse off than slaves because their survival is not important.  If they were slaves their slavemaster would be forced to take care of them to an extent, keep them alive and fed and able to work, as they are his property and of value to him, but instead they are extendable and forced to either work their bodies into the ground in order to scrape by or die.

* Wenger is a specialist in failure. Mourinho is not afraid of failure, he is not used to it. If he went 9 years without winning a trophy he would go far away from Chelsea.

* If Abramovich had given him 8 years to build team, he just wants 4 and to be able to deserve more.

* John isn't back this weekend, Cahill is out too. Hasn't fully trained since knock at WBA.

* We don't want a replay. We are going to play and try to win against City.

* Cech was important in the last game. We are confident but they will be too. Both teams will also be worried.

* Roy did well to finish the speculation on JT's return.

* It is not good to play consecutive matches against the same team because you try to read the last game.

* Won't be the same team because of injuries but philosophies won't change.

* We don't score enough goals for the quality of football we play.  

* FA cup allows for teams to win trophies that would not normally do so.

* Doesn't like records between managers, because it is about teams. If Pellegrini says he doesn't like to talk about him, he hopes he doesn't.

One thing the article proves is you are now no better off living in London than up here in the north.

&gt; In Kensington and Chelsea, average weekly rents were a staggering 73 per cent of local wages, £605 out of £826, 71 per cent in Westminster, £524 out of £737, and 51 per cent across the capital — £338 out of £658 — which is believed to be the first time it has gone over the half-way mark.

So if the average weekly wage is £658 a week / £34,216 a year which is only £26,085 take home and you're paying out £338 a week / £17,576 a year then after rent you've only £8,509 left to live on.

If you actually read it, it has been configured to only allow tracing from a local address (remote is denied). The screenshot in the blog shows the same thing.    

Is it ugly? Sure. But frankly the only way to get to the trace viewer is to manually type in the URL.     

The blog conflates legitimate security concerns (unsalted, unhashed password storage) with a little bit of whining. There are only roughly two actual security issues in that blog post (password storage, and cookie crossover) and then just nonsense to pad it out (and make it sound worse).     

Quick summary:     

 - ""Password storage"" (a legitimate concern. They should be hashing and salting passwords. This is not mathematically reversible).   
 - ""Encryption is not selective – data is either important or it’s not"" (this is actually a continuation of ""Password storage"" essentially whining that the site is MITM resistant and encrypted, but passwords aren't stored securely).    
 - ""Mixed content and browser warnings"" (when Tesco likely implemented this, pop-ups were treated by browsers like external pages, so essentially you could mix a secure page with an insecure pop-up, because the pop-up was thought to have limited ability to interact with its parent page. Since then browsers updated to be more restrictive, and give content-mixing warnings when pop-ups are generated from a secure parent which generates an insecure child (since someone could MITM-alter the child and inject ""bad shit"" into the parent)). Tesco has also fixed this (made the pop-up secure).    
 - ""Browser version craziness"" (pure whiny bullshit. Has no place in this article).    
 - ""Persistent insecurity through HTTP cookies"" (legitimate issue. Cookies should be flagged so they only load on HTTPS requests).    
 - ""Password rules"" (this is the same as ""Password storage"" just phased in a different way).    
 - ""Security misconfiguration"" (totally bullshit. Either they don't know what they're talking about or trying to extend the length of the article, I suspect the latter).     
 - ""Very old web server and framework"" (still both supported by the vendor, so just more whining).

Fact is, Martinez is repaying his loyalty to the club by letting him retire on his own terms rather than be forced to leave when his contract is not renewed.

I'm not saying we should scratch the Scottish government off the Christmas card list, but tying ourselves up with currency is madness.  

The UK has spent most of my life resisting entering into a federated currency union, the skepticism of that position has been borne out by recent events.  Now we're just supposed to say yes to this because Scotland fancies being quasi-independent?  

Should Scotland become independent then I don't know why they'd expect Westminster to start doing them huge favours.

Well, I do understand why they don't want to shoulder debt in a currency they don't have a stake in. Economists have [a fairly disparaging term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin_%28economics%29) about taking on debt in someone else's currency.

I don't think a currency union is in the interests of the UK, or probably the interests of Scotland, but I think Salmond is right to say that the UK leaders are strong-arming him. The point of this announcement was entirely to make independence less likely. Salmond, however, is wrong to pretend Scotland could just take up sterling, no questions asked.

Salmond's biggest, most deceitful play is pretending that Scotland leaving would be fine. It wouldn't be. At least in the short term, it would be an enormous, expensive, bureaucratic clusterfuck, with hundreds of pitfalls, some of which they'll fall into just by sheer statistics.

No. The chart I showed was spend **per person**.   Because London gets **5 grand per head** rather than the rest of the UK's **100 quid a head**, London is essentially artificially subsidised. What's great is it snowballs - the more people in the area, the more 5 grands per head you enjoy for building infrastructure.  

 In other cities, only receiving 100 quid per head, means as a city expands, transport grinds to a halt, resulting in grid lock in a morning and an artificially locked population.  This means other cities can't expand to compete with London. 

London has an artificially sustained population, which lead to business incubation success.  You have 5 grand a head and struggle to get to work, imagine only having 100 quid per person for transport policy.  That's the economic environment Leeds and Manchester have to compete with - a government that provides essentially no infrastructure support to cities trying to build businesses competing with London.

London could collapse, only it wouldn't break the UK. If instead of spending 5 grand per head in London, we spent 4 grand, and we spent 1 grand rather than 100 quid elsewhere, we would have better transport infrastructure 

If cross rail's money was spent on a HS2 link between York, Leeds and Manchester, calling at commuter towns along the way, can you imagine the synergy that would occur?  Manchester's media presence, Leeds' finance, York research, that's a silicon valley style hot bed.

You have a mentality that says - ""London generates wealth, therefore London gets the bulk of transport spend.""

These are the children of the first wave of migrants who were granted citizenship in the 60s of the last century after the collapse of the British colonies. They are full British, work here, pay taxes and learn.

That seems to be defending the black people in the photos. Obviously the translation could be off, but it seems to me to be saying that in Russia it's sometimes called 'black spoiled London' but actually most of the black people are 2nd and later generation British people from the former colonies, who pay taxes. (and learn - study, improve themselves?)

Then it mentions a white guy who is wearing his trousers low in the black style (that's more US thing that UK, as it happens).

A couple of the comments seem more racist to me.

49 : That's the Gherkin in Aldgate. Google Maps link [here](http://goo.gl/maps/RHFZ3).

Using google earth and aligning the buildings up, my best bet would be that both photos are being taken from the same building - most probably Heron tower. http://goo.gl/maps/X4VRv. There's a restaurant there : http://www.herontower.com/the-building/the-restaurant, and there's a user photo gallery here that places it in the right spot : http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d3381993-r148271286-Sushisamba-London_England.html

Though I'm not sure that's where these photos were taken from, it's the most likely location. The other alternative is 99 Bishopsgate, which I don't believe is open to the public asides from access to a highwalk - though it doesn't seem tall enough. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99_Bishopsgate and there's also another skyscraper under construction opposite : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Bishopsgate

If you're visiting London and want to specifically go to areas where there will be views of London, here are my recommendations:

1. St Pauls Cathedral. A ticket to the top also allows you entry into the tombs and there's a wealth of history in that structure. The whispering gallery is also great.

2. The Shard. New, corporate london. It'll cost an arm and a leg for a ticket, but it's the tallest building in europe and you asked for a view.

3. The Millenium Eye. Another tourist favourite.

All those locations are easy to get to and staple tourist destinations - they're not well kept secrets :) I was previously unaware of Heron towers restaurant - but I bet it's pricey.

Increase the search to 30 miles, a typical commute here which takes about 45 minutes, and that increases to over 300.

As an aside this is why employment is high in Hull as most jobs available require skills whereas much of the unemployed in Hull are looking for unskilled work. Unemployment in most of East Yorkshire is a lot lower although we do have to commute 20 miles or so average but thankfully due to a low population density that doesn't take long.

true,tomatopathe,null,null,"Yes, and I made up my mind a long time ago. 

The main issue is, Scotland's central belt is one of two highest GDP poles in the UK (along with the English south-east). 

And yet, Scotland has the lowest per family income in the UK, with the exception of some parts of Cornwall, Wales and Northern Ireland. You can take a guess at where the highest is. As a consequence, like you will see anywhere else in the World, Scottish people have a lower life expectancy, and worse prospects in general. 

Scotland constantly gets accused of scrounging off of England, when Scotland generates more income per capita than England. Turns out the ratio of per capita government revenue to government expenditure is about the same - that is pre-oil revenue figures. 

So yes, we'll be better off. It is obvious that Scotland (via the oil) has been, along with London City, subsidizing the UK. (Edit: I should add, by subsidizing the rest of the UK, I in fact mean the more densely populated part of the UK, which happens to be the City of London and environs). 

So even with a share of the debt, even without the common currency (it would have been nice), Scotland will be better off.

They got me into my first job. I went to the assessment and signed my work contract precisely a week later. If you consider sales as an option, I can 100% recommend them. They provide training, they will do a survey into your interests and skills and only put forward jobs that they think you can be successful in. Once they got me into my first job, I never had trouble getting new offers. I only changed company once, but even in my new company they have been using them to do graduate recruitment and everyone I know has been using them has done well since then.

1.
***not guilty*** of a crime or offence.
""the prisoners were later found innocent""

not guilty
phrase of guilty
1.
***innocent***, especially of a formal charge.

But dont try and screw us over just because we dont like the road the uk is on with all the gutting of institutions that were British powerhouses like the royal mail, NHS and free education for uni students. 

We have a shared history and culture but the future looks grim in union with Westminister and it not as if indy is a cure all for that shit but its a chance to have more choice on what direction our country is going in and better representation as currently.
 I consider myself British and Scottish and proud of being both. If the UK stopped going down the path of gutting the NHS, Royal Mail and screwing over uni students I would vote no in a heartbeat and would vehemently defend the union to anyone I met in Scotland.

He was dealt an awful hand with the transfers of Keane and Berbatov. Bent was never going to be good enough and Pavlyuchenko, even after he settled, was never a consistent performer. Top 4 was not a realistic goal with the players he had. But you can't go 8 games without winning at this club.

Ramos should have done better with what he had. Playing Ledley King in the league instead of the UEFA-cup would have been a start. Doing your own press conferences, even with a translator, instead of sending poor Poyet out might have helped.

true,Flobblem,derbyshire,"From Derbyshire, alreet youth?","If that person felt violated by the fact that their partner had pestered/guilted them into sex then it certainly could count as rape, even if it is as simple as you describe. 

The majority of rapes are committed by close friends of the victim, and are not thought of as rape by the perpetrator because of 'mixed signals' i.e. that they pressured the victim into it and was surprised when the victim felt abused by this.

A partner's body is not your property, it is their right to not have sex. If you truly change their mind then there's no problem, but if it is a regular thing, and the partner feels that their body is being used for sexual gratification without their enthusiastic consent this can lead to serious mental suffering and feelings of violation. Only because we still objectify the female body is this not viewed as 'legitimate rape' (if you excuse me using a rightism) because the perpetrator gained consent though it was not enthusiastic or really meaningful. However the point is that if she didn't want to and you change her mind then you better be damn sure that she really means it because otherwise you could be doing her (and yourself) real harm. 
This is what is meant by the (in my opinion not very effective) campaigns saying 'teach men not to rape' the problem is that our society teaches us that rape is normal by associating violence with sex as a matter of course. This means that what is deemed 'rape' is in actuality only a thin slice of what actually happens to men and women every day, while the act of having sex with someone against their will occurs surprisingly often, and usually within tight social groups.

Just don't fuck anyone unless they give enthusuastic consent, that's an easy concept to grasp and I've never had any trouble with it.

A lot of players never recover and the atmosphere is so bad that it affects their play and the opinions that the parent club managers and coaches have of them.

It's also not clear to me whether Whisky revenue is counted in those numbers either - sounds stupid, but for the population of Scotland, the numbers for whisky are quite big. 

What less certain is how much oil there is left. The 30 years number is extremely conservative. 

Some sources (in the industry mind you, not just pulled out of the innards of an SNP stooge) say [possibly 100 years](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2131258/North-Sea-oil-will-last-for-100-years.html), the average I always hear is in the 50-70 range. Even then, that's not good enough for a long term plan. 

Regardless, Scotland does not necessarily need to depend solely on oil for revenues and wealth - I would rather see oil used as ""just in case"" savings rather than a quick spend.

I don't think Scotland, in the long run, needs oil anyway. It's a small country, like many others around it who do fine.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"Walker probably beats out Johnson on how they've been playing this season.

I also think a middle 3 of Hendo/Gerrard/Rooney won't provide enough defensive work rate for Gerrard to shine.  Coutinho's been running his fuckin' socks off in the last few games to recover, press, and defend.  If he was being more lazy then the midfield would have struggled far more.  If Rooney is willing and able to put in that kind of defensive work rate then this works, but if he can't or won't then England will get torn up through the middle just like Liverpool has when playing a 2 man midfield involving Stevie.

This is going to sound insane but I'd swap Lallana (and he's one of my favorite non-Liverpool players, so I hate suggesting dropping him) for Wilshere (I hate the whiny little twat so it's even harder to admit to adding him at all), move Wilshere into the center of the park to make it a solid 3 man midfield, and let Rooney/Sturridge move around freely similar to how we let Sturridge/Suarez drift about and interchange who is wider and who is central.  Wilshere is just hard working and defensively solid enough to do a job.  Him and Henderson in the middle of the park offers maximum protection for Gerrard in the deeper role and then both of them can get forward a bit on their day too.  Think of it like Wilshere playing the role Coutinho plays for us except a little better defensively and a little worse going forward.  Looks like this:

Walker - Cahill - Jagielka - Baines

-----------------Gerrard--------------------

--------Wilshere - Henderson--------

Sterling------Rooney---------Sturridge

true,[deleted],null,null,"First years are called ""freshers"" in the UK. As a fresher you will stay in a halls of residence (shortened to ""halls""). You would normally only stay in them for the first year of University then you will need to find your own place with any friends you have made. In halls it is unusual to share a room with someone else. The normal set up is 5-10 people sharing a flat with a kitchen/living area, and a toilet/shower per 4 people. Depending on how much you want pay you can get nicer (or worse accommodation), there will be number of different places to choose from, en suites are becoming more common. Whichever halls you are in will become part of your university identity; along with your course, it will probably be the first thing someone asks you when you meet. If you can speak to someone from the university beforehand, they will give you the best advice on which one to pick.

Party culture is bit different. While in the US you would most often have house or dorm party's (and stay at the same place for the whole night). In the UK you would normally start drinking at someone's house or halls of residence (called pre drinking), then you would go out to the bars and clubs. This is due to a lower drinking age, but also the fact that houses (especially student housing or halls) are smaller than in America, so house party's aren't particularly practical. Being able to go to bars and clubs isn't necessarily a good thing, as it's obviously more expensive.

While on the subject of alcohol, don't be expected to try and keep up with everyone else. Many people will already have 2/3 years of experience at getting drunk, so will be able to handle their alcohol a lot better than you. (This is a generalisation, so I apologise if you are in fact a functioning alcoholic).

The first week of the year is called ""freshers week"", basically a week of partying, enjoy it as much as possible. In fact, enjoy your first as much as possible. The majority of courses only require a 40% pass in first year, and this doesn't effect your degree at all. Join some clubs and societies, and you will get to know lots more people. I think this is just as important as getting a good degree.

true,Clarkinho,lfc68,,"I used to think the same but I was wrong. I recently had it really well explained to me by by an A level coach on a course. Hopefully this makes sense when I try explain it. 

Left sided center halfs rarely (very very very very very rarely) perform well on the right side because its so unnatural to them and here's why:

Left footers are a lot rarer than right footed players (obviously) so they always play on the left side. Even in a top youth team you'd have maybe 3-4 left footers so its even rarer to have 2 left footed centre halfs. This basically means that a left footed centre half will play on the left side close to 100% of the time during his development (and career) whereas its common to have 2 right footed centre halfs in a starting 11 so they get a lot more experience there. I know players who are right footed but they play only on the left side of center back, that would almost never happen the other way round.

Basically, as a left footed centre half, you will have almost no experience playing on the right side because the pool of players with a right foot is so much larger. It's one of the reasons left footed players are usually very good crossers of a ball too, and thats especially relevant at intermediate level where there might be 2 left footed players in a squad and they would usually play left full and left wing so there crossing naturally develops. 

Left footed players only really get experience on the right in more advanced roles up the pitch, whereas its common for a right footed player to have played on the left his whole career...did I do the explanation any justice? 

TL;DR: left footers play on the left through close to 100% of there development, whereas right footers play both sides because of the commonness of them - So lefties rarely develop to be able to play both sides.

The length, quality, and content of British shows aren't *universally* suited to American television.  It's a slow process and, frankly, not everything translates.  They're two distinct countries with some distinct cultural differences and a ""just deal with it"" attitude is precisely how a show that you enjoy will never find a broader audience... especially given that the MacGuffin of the show, a graphic novel, is itself an iconic American art form.

When I first became a fan and had some questions about the club he was more than willing to answer all my questions and did not seem bothered by them.  His posts here were always very informative and a treat for someone who is a distance from the club.  

It is always tough when subreddits get bigger.  I know personally I don't contribute that much in here anymore because it seems like there can be tension between members.  Also it can be annoying when posts repeat themselves and the content is not as focused on analysis of the matches, which are the type of posts I enjoy more than stuff from instagram, how does one get tickets to matches or asking whether X player is going to be sold in the summer, or are we going to get Costa/Cavani/Hulk in the summer.

It seemed like this place was more of a community when I joined and people were happy to chat with each other and the exchange of ideas and tactics was more civil.  I am sure people who were around before me thought the same when I joined.

We can't expect him to become a superstar but he is talented and versatile enough to be a very good player for us.  Guy can play in a CAM/Support striker role and either wing and actually plays the wing in the manner of a natural winger (stays wide, takes him man on, hits crosses when he can) but also has the ability to drive inside as an inverted winger.  He is decent on the ball and a solid passer though clearly not the best on the team at either. He is solid in the air and big enough to give teams issues on set pieces. 

Chaldi's biggest strength may be his versatility and ability to play multiple roles.  It also may be his biggest weakness because he is good but not great at any number of things which is good but because he isn't ""great"" at anything it means it can constantly be improved.

I can't see him ever being a star (whereas Lamlea and Townsend seem to have the potential to do so) but he could be one of those guys that contributes at a fairly high level for years.

&gt; **Why is it private?**
&gt;
&gt; A good analogy would be a conversation among friends. That’s what this subreddit is to many of the members. The privacy helps prevent external voting, anonymous abuse, the comfort to speak absolutely freely, and also, most importantly, personal discussion. A lot of the users interact with each other off-site quite often, be it through Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and even in person.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The privacy is of no slight to the rest of the main sub, and there are quite a few members that comment in both. It’s very similar to having a group talk and talking amongst friends or family. There’s advantages to both and you wouldn’t necessarily restrict yourself to one or the other.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The privacy is also used to uphold the vision that the moderators/creators have for the place, which was described above. Finally, there’s a decent amount of sarcasm and irony, that when taken out of context, can appear to be a lot more offensive than it really is.

Our economy is heavily influenced by Consumer spending as one of our main ways of generating money is through tax. 

Consumer spending is somewhat dictated by the value of the GBP, because internationally importation is (usually) dealt with in USD. So the better value the pound is - the less we spend on imports meaning lower costs when it reaches the consumer. 

To use an example.

Item A is developed in the US and has a wholesale cost of $3. 10 years ago, when 1GBP = 2USD this would have cost a UK retailer £1.50 to purchase. Now, when the price of the GBP dropped to $1.5 suddenly this item has cost 33% more. That cost is then passed on to the consumer - resulting in us spending less due to price increases which in turn leads to less economic activity and the situation we've seen over the past few years.

My point is that regardless of whether it was meant to just ""embarrass"" /u/EnglishMD (which I don't understand how that would achieve the purpose), the fact is a public arena was used for a private joke, meaning that it was very condescending to everyone not involved with /r/CFCUK. 

The only people embarrassed during the whole thing were the people who said they agreed with someone they respected only to have the person tell them they were being fucked with. Whatever the motives were, it was simply condescending. Saying ""we didn't mean anything by it"" doesn't change that fact.

The team in the blue and white strip (Everton maybe?) must have had some really sore bumholes after Teixeira tore them apart over and over again.  Seriously, it was like clip after clip of him raping their midfield with awesome dribbling or cutting passes.

He really reminds me a lot of Joao Moutinho, which I think is fucking awesome.  I love Moutinho and I'm really bummed that he's at Monaco right now because I wanted to see him make a move to a much more established european club and show his talents on the big stage.  He's just awesome.  If Teixeira can reach that kind of level eventually then we've got a real gem here.

The clips where he sets up Yesil are so :) :( ... I wish Yesil didn't get hurt again, he's (was) another potential big one for the future.

Nobody minded. From the way they were talking, it was fairly obvious they were not slagging people off behind their backs or anything.

But in some cases it can be a problem. Overheard conversations can be an important channel of communication. You discover that someone is struggling with a problem that you know the answer to, or that someone is about to make a serious mistake because they have misunderstood instructions. You lose that channel if not everyone is speaking English.

If it gets to the stage were a majority of the members of a particular team are not using English, including at break time, then the minority can end up feeling paranoid and excluded. It might even amount to workplace bullying. It certainly isn't good for efficient working.

That's what causes upsets, and that's what creates that uncontrollable variable in all competitions in the sports world.  However, it is not fair to say that stats and projections mean nothing.

I work for a government department where the senior management have a fondness for phrases which are structured along the lines of, *""Discrimination is where someone is disadvantaged or treated differently on the basis of a protected characteristic . . . ""*

This reveals something about that mindset.  *(And if you feel like pushing at the line of reasoning in a vaguely ad hominem way I'd be inclined to propose, ""So, until they were made illegal signs that said, 'No Irish, No blacks!' weren't discriminatory then, right?"")*

Anyhow, to be illegal it'd have to impinge on a protected right.  That's not to say it's not misguided, spiteful, or generally offensive to decent people, just not illegal.  The obvious place to look for a breach of the law would be the Equalities Act.  There's nothing in that that I'm aware of that entitles you to freedom of language.

You'd have to make an argument that it's a racist policy, I would guess.  The problem there would be that they'd point out that since you had to be fluent in English to get the job, you haven't been disadvantaged.  Added to which the employer would simply argue that the policy isn't one of race, it's that they want to ensure that other employees and far more importantly customers know they can communicate with you.

There's another really important issue to be considered here.  For something like a retain there are usually in the most literal sense dozens of people who'd snap the employer's hand off for your job.  Now, it may be that if I sack you for speaking a language other than English I'm breaking the law.  And maybe if you drag me through an Employment Tribunal I'll lose and get a slap on the wrists.  Of course that relies on your being able to fund £1,200 in fees just to get the Tribunal to consider your case.  What's that?  Around two hundred hour's wages at minimum wage?  

So, if you can find five week's wages spare **and** you drag me through a Tribunal **and** the Tribunal finds against me I might get told off and I might even have to pay you some compensation.  The thing is you're either still sacked or you still know I'll treat you badly if I'm forced to take you back and everyone else knows it too.  And nearly all employees in those sort of situations will toe the line and do as they're told.

Then, how can you tell a developing country to reduce their emissions when our own country produces twice or in the case of the US, four times as much CO2 per capita as them?

If the EU and the US were to reduce CO2 emissions to the same per capita rate as China, that would already cut *worldwide* CO2 emissions by 11%! That alone would already make a huge difference in the rate of climate change.

And only then, when everyone is on the same level, would the developing countries like India and China no longer have an excuse to postpone their own CO2 emissions reductions.

By the way, based on the rate of investment in renewable energy, China is well on course to being far more energy efficient and vastly reduce their CO2 emissions long before we ever get round to doing it. Actions speak louder than words, and while China is pushing billions into their renewable energy R&amp;D, the UK, along with other western countries are cutting, cutting and cutting funding for renewable energy R&amp;D.

With regards to pollution, we in the UK had our industrial period, staining the trees black with soot. Then we cleaned it up. You must have heard the case study of the moths that were almost wiped out due to the pollution messing up their camouflage colours and then almost getting wiped out again when we cleaned up and messed up their colours again.

The Peak District is lovely, the Hope Valley is my favourite and it's only 15 minutes on the train from Sheffield. Sheffield is an hour from York and the train to Manchester/Liverpool goes though the Hope Valley.

Sheffield is ok but not what I'd call touristy. The Steel City is know for its famous Cutlery, the home of Steel and the home of modern Football (soccer) so I wouldn't think there's much there other than stuff like [Kelham Island] (http://www.simt.co.uk/kelham-island-museum/plan-your-visit) or the Real Ale scene. It's more of a vibrant city you move to than visit for a day.

Have you thought of going to the seaside for some fish and chips, rock and lovely freezing weather? Whitby is great.
