true,sperf,null,null,"Without commenting on whether it's right or wrong, I'm not sure this loan system is quite as sustainable as most people are making it out to be. If we start to realize some success from this system (i.e., turn substantial profit on some players and introduce some others into our first team), other clubs will want to replicate it.

The only real barriers to entry are 1) sufficient capital to purchase players up front and 2) a fair amount of club prestige (why would a promising young player want to sign for a club only to get farmed out when the parent club is Stoke City? may as well remain at your current club or transfer to another club where you'll instantly be in the first team). There are plenty of clubs (e.g., Real, Man City, Man United, PSG, Monaco) that could implement this sort of system right away. Admittedly, though, it takes several years to start to realize benefits from this system.

Once there are even more clubs going after the same promising young players, prices and wages for them will rise. Other clubs will be willing to pay premiums on these young stars because they know they'll probably at least be making a tidy profit in a couple years. This means slimmer margins for everyone, including Chelsea. At some point, the market may stabilize and profits may remain fairly reasonable. However, profits could shrink to a point where it no longer makes sense to invest in so many young players.

Then there is the possibility of regulation by the FA, UEFA, or FIFA. Since we are the only ones who have implemented this sort of system so far and it has happened so recently, there's no telling how the governing authorities will respond if 10 or 15 major clubs start accumulating dozens of young stars and loaning them out. 

**In conclusion,** I think it is too early to tell whether this loan system is sustainable. It seems to be working very well so far. However, increased competition from other large clubs and/or regulation from the governing bodies may reduce its effectiveness.",0,1392931767,null,0,false,0,cfkgcbk,t3_1ygbhb,t1_cfkgcbk,t3_1ygbhb,null,1432486187,2,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,2

It's not cool at all to dismiss a side as ""sub-par"" right after they beat us. Where's the glory in that? The game is about glory, and there's no glory to be had when you dismiss competitions and opponents. In particular reference to today, I thought Dnipro outplayed us and deserved to win.

And they might like the input/output slur with it too. .io helps startups get a short and sweet domain that's impossible with a .com, just like people using .ly and so on. Also Google treats .io as a global domain name, so in terms of brandability it is a good shout too.

As for signing up, we used to avoid it. But as we have grown, we are aware we need to be diligent about the transactions we perform and who to. Hence limits within 24 hours and such (as per the FAQ).

Also, we are going to be adding some interesting features in the future that will require an account, such as rewards and gamification.

Is this an example of the US adding to the stability of Europe by defending against potential Russian aggression, or is it the US participating in a damaging and destabilising arms race with Russia?

* Prohibition doesn't reduce use or addiction, rather the opposite since people can't admit that they have a problem openly like alcoholics are more likely to do.

* The societal costs are huge, everything from police work to court proceedings. It costs billions while that money should instead go to preventing drug problems not punishing the ones that have it.

* Far from all drug users are addict, in fact the UN estimates that only 10% of drug users have a problem that affects themselves and/or the people around them.

* The stigmatization of a large part of society, because of what you choose to put in your body that doesn't effect anyone else than you you are often stigmatized by society as a whole, if you are arrested you will also have all the issues that follows from having a criminal record.

* People should simply have the right to do as they wish with their bodies, I'm not saying that it's good to use drugs but just like with alcohol or tobacco we should have the choice. If you do a criminal act while on drugs you should be charged for that act and nothing else. Just like the case with alcohol today.

* It's not more harmful than alcohol, or in my opinion much less harmful. Most people that drink can relate to that they wouldn't want alcohol to be illegal because it harms them or that some people get into fights while drunk, stoners almost never get aggressive.

* It doesn't make you more stupid than watching TV or drinking.

* The global war on drugs is wrecking havoc for hundreds of thousands of people across the world.

* Criminal gangs get half of their funding from illegal drugs, if we make it legal we cut their income in half and also get money from taxes that goes back into good things in society instead of criminal gangs.

See question 7 in the [Patient FAQ](http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/records/healthrecords/Documents/Care.data%20patient%20FAQs%20V3%2019022014.pdf). Question 22 elaborates on when your personal data will be shared.

Stuff like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1yfpnj/after_combing_through_the_health_records_of_13/).

The impact of bad drugs like Thalidomide would also have been greatly reduced with this data. I cannot emphasise just how epic this dataset is and the potential it has. Within a couple of years they'll have identified a bunch of trends leading to screening programs which will save thousands of lives. I was being honest earlier when I said I was a privacy advocate but the benefits of this are worth it, provided that it's done in the right way. 

Data can be great. They've recently figured out that, contrary to popular belief, some screening programs are fairly worthless. For example, [breast cancer screening in older women with no family history of the cancer is apparently pointless](http://www.aafp.org/news/health-of-the-public/20130116bcscreeningstudy.html). Prostate cancer is similar. This will let us focus the NHS on stuff that brings in the best ""bang for the buck"".

In this CCTV footage, the victim can be seen knocking on a house door in Gresham, Middlesbrough.

He argued with a woman at the house before Harvey emerged and pushed him into the road.

The two men square up to each other before Harvey launches a powerful punch at the victim's face.

He then pushed the man to the ground before he starts kneeing and kicking. One witness said the victim was kicked ""like a football"".

The man was left unconscious but despite this Harvey continued to kick him.

Eventually, another man drags the victim to the side of the road before the police show up.

UK based international exchange.

Yes, low volume (we're only a few months old, and only implemented banking transfers a few weeks ago).

Because of our [Alternative Funding](https://ibwt.co.uk/en/company/funding) you can fund via bank, or via Royal Mail, with 0 risk to your own account. And we don't require so much verification as other exchanges (unless you plan to trade large amounts, and by that I mean £2,500-£10,000+).

Keeping in mind that every other exchange has a foot in the banking world, we don't (our banking is done via a partnership with OKPAY). 

Via our banking service you can deposit/withdraw up to the equivalent of $100,000 per month, which can be increased upon request.

If you're just after doing some day trading, or deposit/withdrawing coins, then you need 0 verification. We use enforced 2fa for login (email), with optional 3fa (google auth) and 2fa for coin withdrawal (email again).

Feel free to drop us a line at support@ibwt.co.uk if you have any questions.

true,Atomicide,num22,,"Soldado was the worst buy of the summer, and it's absolutely nothing to do with the guy himself. I feel he has been utterly let down by the management of this team.

Last season we often looked like clowns when trying to break down defences with AVB's tactics and style. The apparently solution to this was to buy a guy who was ruthless in the box. Let that sink in for a minute. **A team struggling to get the ball through defences, bought a guy whose game relied on receiving a ball through the defence.**

*That's like dropping an assault force behind reinforced enemy lines and asking the guys who can't get past it to send them supplies. It's a monumental amount of stupidity.*

What's now worse is that Solado has adapted his game. That heroic little bastard can pass like a fucking wizard, his link up play is phenomenal. The astounding fact is, Soldado has somehow managed to gel into this team, even though he is no longer getting playing time with it. The guy has clearly recognised there are going to be problems scoring, and has almost effortlessly changed his play-style to try and bring as much benefit as he can to the team.

Now for the soul-destroying part. This guy was always going to be ineffective under AVB unless he adapted his game. It was adapt or be left behind and he adapted. However now Sherwood is at the helm and we have a team that needs the previous version of Soldado. This team is now playing a style of football that provides Soldado service to the box, but he isn't really that guy now. His shooting confidence is shot, his technique is rusty, and he is now still drifting to the channels where he used to be effective.

Basically, we bought an in-the-box striker and forced him to adapt to our slow, methodical system. Then changed everything and brought in a new system that suits his old playing style. 

Add in a pinch of fickle fans on his back, and a capable-yet-dangerous love interest (Adebayor) and you have all the makings of some kind of shitty football based teen love film.

Soldado has been completely messed around by this team and it is unfair to him. At this point I expect his season will not get much better, and he is not to blame. I don't rate Sherwood, but won't blame the guy for sticking with Adebayor as the guy is putting away the goals. Hopefully we get a new manager in the summer who can give everyone a clean slate and start moulding a system that suits the players we have.

Just remember, last season Adebayor was in the same position. He was a ""waste of money"", ""a useless cunt"", ""greedy"", ""lazy"", ""bad attitude"", and a whole host of other things. That same guy many people wrote off is now putting away almost a goal a game. ",0,1392942430,null,0,false,1,cfkle9t,t3_1yh6yv,t1_cfkle9t,t3_1yh6yv,null,1432488569,64,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,64

I think it speaks volumes about this sub that you felt you would get reproached for giving your honest (and correct) opinion. We don't know the first thing about Assaidi apart from he is technically a Liverpool player. I rarely post here anymore because there's this blind loyalty wherein even the slightest hint of criticism is met with a barrage of down votes and accusations of not being a true fan. There are White Knights everywhere. You can almost guarantee that if someone posted a well thought out, well written, inoffensive comment that was critiquing a particular player and suggesting he wasn't good enough for Liverpool, it would have less upvotes than the reply of ""Support your team, mate. He's one of us. YNWA."" It seems like childish nonsense to have to say,

&gt;I'm sorry he's injured but...

before being allowed to criticise him.

Assaidi has literally never played more than 90 minutes for Liverpool, but because we pay his wages it means I'm supposed to have an emotional attachment towards him and be upset when he gets injured? He hasn't had any endearing performances for the club. Nothing to grab a hold of and go ""that's why I love him."" He won't be here next season. He was barely a starter for Stoke. He simply isn't good enough and it's not fair on him to just allow him to rot away on the bench. Do you think Assaidi would get into the Spurs, Chelsea, United, City, Arsenal squads? Of course he wouldn't. So why should he get into ours?

This is going to sound incredibly arrogant but I sometimes wonder how many people here actually fully understand football and what constitutes a decent player. I don't know if it's a recent occurrence but it sure feels like at the moment the sub is filled with a lot of ignorant, naval staring, half-fans that refuse to remove the rose tinted spectacles. I'm honestly sick of the happy-clappy nature of some of these discussions. I love LFC as much as anyone. I live and breath it. I'm allowed to say I dislike a player and that he doesn't belong at the club. Sorry for rambling. I just agree with the point you were making.

As much as he's been screwed on and off the pitch, he's there to score goals, plain and simple.  No matter what's going on in your head, no matter how you've been treated, no matter how many excuses you could come up with, when the ball is coming to you five yards from an open goal, natural playing instinct needs to kick in and that ball needs to ripple the net.

There are plenty of other players who have to deal with a change in league, personal dramas and high pressure situations, and manage to cope fine.  Heck, nearly every major purchase from La Liga in recent seasons has done it - Torres, Negredo, Aguero, Silva, Mata.  None of those guys had a walk in the park... arguably all were playing for ""bigger"" teams with even greater expectations.

We on this sub have had a lot of patience and made a lot of excuses for him, both personal and professional.  But he's just not up to the task at the moment.  I'm not sure what the solution is, and I damn well hope he comes good, but I somehow don't really see that happening this season anymore.

) 

The RS-26 is fundamentally different from the Iskander missiles. The latter are theatre ballistic missiles and have small range. The RS-26 is a intercontinental missile and is made with Nuclear weapon warheads as the overt intention. That competition would remain regardless as its a vital security interest. 

There is already a treaty that is meant to stop this type of arms race, the [INF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inf_Treaty). Of course both are now violating the treaty to shit because China is not a signatory and is slowly upgrading its ICBM capabilities as well.  It's a fear of China rather thats the prime motivator for Russia. The race I think would have gone on regardless of Europe. 

The real scary thing is that both Russia and China are slowly trying to test hypersonic missiles. The US which is far ahead in technology expects to get them into [service within 10 years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_X-51). The others are not near that deadline but are continuing to try, China to reach parity with the US and Russia to simply stay in the race. These missiles systems they are all developing travel at hypersonic speed and can hit a target anywhere in the world within an hour. That's one of the reasons the supersonic system, RS-26, is met with barely a shrug from the US (besides hypocritically complaining about the INF violations).

A son of an American oil millionaire was murdered after going to see a man he met on the internet while playing computer games, it has been revealed.

Breck Bednar reportedly told his father he was going for a sleepover at a friend's house in Caterham, Surrey.

But instead he travelled 30 miles to Grays, Essex, where he died on Monday from a neck wound.

Paying tribute to his son, Mr Bednar, 49, told the London Evening Standard he was a 'happy, gentle and smart boy' and was excited after returning from a school trip to Spain.

""I last saw him on Sunday. He was a happy, gentle and smart boy. He had been in Spain for 10 days and he was excited to see us and be home again,"" Mr Bednar said.

Mr Bednar originally from Houston, was managing director of brokers BGC Partners and currently works as a partner for Tandem Partners SARL.

Breck's mother Lorin LaFave who went to Michigan State University, regularly attends St John the Evangelist church in Caterham and is a teaching assistant at St John's Church of England Primary School.

It is believed Breck stopped going to church and turned to computer games for his entertainment.

Rev Jeremy Garton of St John's Church, said: ""These are tragic circumstances and we are doing everything we can do to support the family at this difficult time.""

People have flocked to Twitter and Facebook to pay their respects.

""Two nights ago, Breck told his father that he was going to his friend's house for a sleep-over a couple of streets away. This wasn't a huge concern for his parents. He ended up taking a train down to Essex, about two hours away to meet the man he had been talking to over the internet.

""Early the next morning, the police found his body.

""I didn't write this post to get sympathy points, but to make people aware that there are very real threats to children on the internet. It can make a predator's job very easy. I implore you to talk to your children or any child close to you about internet safety, and to under no circumstance allow them to meet someone face-to-face that they've met on the internet.""

Lewis Daynes, 18, of Grays, has been charged with murder and has appeared before Basildon magistrates.

He was fantastic, got tidy feet when in possession mixed with great vision and passing, he's well able to spot runs being made and hits them with precision. 

When he runs with the ball, it's like he's slow motion, the way he controls the ball makes him look slow but when he takes on his man he often left them for dead. He's incredibly unpredicatable, he's well able to cut in and take on the shot on his right or he can play down the wings and swing in crosses on his left. A nice mix of a traditional and inverted winger. 

He leads attacks for Dnipro, alot of the play goes through him, he drops deep and takes on possession and can quickly move it from defense into an attack. It's hard to know if he'd have this kind of effect at Liverpool, because there are many players at our club that can launch quick counter attacks.

As for his defensive work, I honestly couldn't give a fair assessment, I wasn't watching him much when Spurs were attacking as I was genuinely more interested in the fixture more than Konoplyanka but he did make it a joy to watch.

Dzeko had a shot blocked by a reflex foot action, Negredo was unlucky not to snatch one. I think City will go to Spain fully confident that they can overpower them.

true,Atomicide,num22,,"Just to be clear, its not that Sherwood is an poor fit for Soldado. In actual fact the Soldado that arrived at Spurs is exactly the kind of player Sherwood wants/needs. However Soldado has been slightly remodelled and doesn't fit as well now. I expect it can be undone though.

In regards to buying him, on paper it was a great idea. Last season we were continually shut out around the outside of the box. I expect they decided the fault was with the strike-force. Defoe didn't fit last years system under AVB (Poacher, no hold up play) and Adebayor wasn't performing (and clearly didn't get on with AVB).

Soldado was the ideal buy for that team. Someone who would create space in the box and get on the end of the defence splitting passes provided by Gareth Bale, as well as the byline crosses from Lennon (made possible by Bale stretching teams who had to double up on him).

Last seasons issues were partly due to misfiring strikers, and partly due to ""the system."" However most of us missed the issues with ""the system"" because we were getting the results. So the blame sat with the strikeforce. This season it's obvious our strikers (and everyone else) was being stifled by AVB's set-up. We didn't have a problem with our strikers, the problem is almost entirely down to the system.

The three people involved in the purchase of Soldado probably saw it like this from their own perspectives.

**AVB** - There is a fault up front, it cannot be ""the system"", it must be the staff (plus we need a third option). Soldado will provide another option, and since the system is so good, he will adapt and be fantastic.

**Baldini** - I have been asked to buy Soldado, he is a proven goalscorer and talent. I see no issues with this purchase and I am happy to proceed.

**Levy** - The manager and Director of Football want this player. There should be a return on investment as he will help attain Champions League football, which will give us improved incomes.

Essentially, from each persons point of view, Soldado was a sound buy. The thing is, and I have used this phrase before, **Soldado is this years solution, to last years problems.** Last year we needed a striker like Soldado, this year (and with this team) he is probably less important. However that does not mean he cannot be awesome, or that he should be sold. It's just that last year he would have been THE solution to our striker woes. This year he is ""just"" a top quality striker available to a team (but misfiring).

If we had the guy last year I expect he would have been dynamite with Bale, better still 2 seasons ago he could have linked with Bale, Modric &amp; Lennon and decimated teams.

The fact of the matter is, on paper he seemed perfect, but what's on the paper, and what happens in reality are two different things. Plans change, players are sold, systems are faulty and manager change. It can happen to anyone.

**On that note, everything I've written here makes sense to me, and might make sense to you on paper. In practice I could be completely wrong, so take time to look up the facts yourselves and make your own decisions and opinions. Everything here is my opinion, and aside from some obvious factual details it can only ever be regarded as speculation at best!**

As it's such a big city, don't expect many people to know or care about you - I sound really mean but it's a sad fact, I hear a lot of American towns have the whole knowing everyone in the community thing going on. 

Politically, expect a lot more left wing supporters. The British Labour Party is almost the one it is more socially accepted to support in a lot of places, and in terms of where it is compared to the American political spectrum, potentially comes much further left than the Democrats. 

I really would recommend coming over here, it's a once in a lifetime opportunity really, and from what I know, support for foreign students is brilliant here. It's part of the cultural difference between the two countries that adds to this, America is all about investing elsewhere, whereas the current government wants foreign investors to buy into our businesses - so you will be thoroughly greeted.

 The 37-year-old admitted that he was disappointed about not being able to extend his current deal and will be returning to parent club Aston Villa following the Championship match against Leeds on Saturday.

“I would have liked to have stayed until the end of the season and try to help Boro climb the table but it was very much out of my hands and I have to go back to Villa,” said Given.

“But I will look back fondly on my time at Boro. I was delighted that Mr Karanaka brought me in. I've had great times here and enjoyed every minute of it.”

The veteran joined the Teesiders in November and has since kept nine clean sheets in 15 games for the club.

He will now be looking to extend that record with another clean sheet in his last match for the club against Leeds.

“I really want to go out on a high at Middlesbrough and keep another clean sheet,"" he added.

“But if I can't do that and it finishes 10-9 then I'd take that now because we just want to win the game. It's all about the team not about me personally, we just want the three points.”",0,1392956274,null,0,false,0,cfkrcrp,t3_1yiath,t1_cfkrcrp,t3_1yiath,null,1432491441,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

Cole won't want to stay as 3rd choice even if we offer new contract

Eto'o

Torres/Ba (Ba would be happier to be 3rd choice behind Lukaku and Cavani but ideal world we sell Torres to save huge wages)

Marin

Moses

Romeu


Selling Luiz would be a mistake, yes he can be dangerous but he can play CB or DM effectively, is very well loved and a great rotation option. Although we would have a (home-grown?) Chalobah to fill in there for him and he would bring in a large fee


Also we will need to find a replacement for an aging Lampard so hopefully Van Ginkel can step up and be that player",1,1392963811,null,0,false,0,cfku3mc,t3_1yi9o1,t1_cfku3mc,t3_1yi9o1,null,1432492735,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

There are a lot of extremely good free Excel courses online. They won't get you a certificate or anything but teaching yourself Excel would be immensely valuable in and of itself, and as a skill to tell employers you have. 


Manual/farm work would also be a good idea. If there are any construction sites, removals companies or farms in your area it would be an excellent move to go along IN PERSON and explain that you're looking for something casual.

Finally, have you considered bar or pub work? Again, go along I'm person and chat to the bar manager and see what he/she's thinks of some casual bar work if they haven't got anything you thank them and ask them to call you if anything comes up. 

Be friendly. Don't be negative. Don't verbally mention your lack of experience - if they want a CV they can have one. You want an employer to look at your barren CV and to want to give you a chance - make sure the person they remember talking to was friendly, open, dressed appropriately and ready to work at a moment's notice.

The key is ""casual"" - none of the employers above would want to take a chance on you fulltime, but their industries all need a lot of time-flexible shift workers.

I would also strongly recommend working in the charity shop. If they'll pay your bus far there's no excuse not to - it's great experience.

The model we are trying to replicate (getting player as young as possible and making them 1st team player) is a proven model and there are plenty of success stories (Barcelona's *La Mesa* being the very top of the iceberg). Everyone (from the UEFA to r/soccer) think it is a viable model.

&gt; Is this the best system for our long term future?

Chelsea has heaps and heaps of talented players, not quite ready for the joy of the Premier League and have no real alternatives than sending them on loan (in UK or abroad) so they can progress. One sensible alternative will be to have ""B team"" is decent leagues (a la Barcelona B or Real Madrid B that are in Segunda Division) so young players can enjoy competitive football and still stay with the parent club (potentially trains with the 1st team).

&gt; Can we expect many of our current loanee list to start for us in the future?

I am not sure ""how many"" is how one should access the success of this model.

I have a great, wonderful, near perfect cycle path on my way home. It does not unfortunately lead to my village it stops in the village before mine (about 2 miles from home).

Here's the thing. It stops on a blind bend, with a speed limit of 40mph. If I use the cyclepath, stop at its end, and try to rejoin traffic from a standstill...Im going to die or get hit eventually.

The issue is not that I simply dont want to use it (I have used it, its nice) the issue is the overal design has (for me) one very very big flaw.

As a result, I dont use it anymore, I maintain 20-25mph avoiding the cyclepath knowing that the cars behind me can see me and overtake when safe todo so and im no longer a sudden surprise for a driver.

Ofcourse - ive had people yell at me, one moped rider recently tailgate me trying to intimidate. All no doubt assume Im doing it for shits and giggles.

You also have the problem of infinite regression.

It sucks, but until we have robots / automation capable of doing the vast majority of the work, guaranteed basic income is not going to be practical.

of course, there is no chance that he can act as our captain. he wasn't captain material even last year, when all of this sub was touting him as one. he is not cold blooded, and lacks concentration. this is not something new though, and has always been his problem. that's why most of us suggested he is not fit for mourinho's preferred style.

in any case, what I am saying is that he should still be a part of our team. he is not going to be our captain, he never was. but he is still our first choice sub, and will be one for some time. there was a reason we bought him from benfica, for so much money. anyone suggesting he is worthless and should be sold, is not a good judge of any football player (same as those who wanted luiz to be captain).

&gt;Vincent's book Self-Made Man retells an eighteen-month experiment in which she disguised herself as a man.[7] This follows in the tradition of undercover journalism such as Black Like Me. Vincent talked about the experience in HARDtalk extra on BBC on April 21, 2006 and described her experiences in male-male and male-female relationships. She joined an all-male bowling club, joined a men's therapy group, went to a strip club, dated women, and used her knowledge as a lapsed Catholic[8][9] to visit monks in a cloister.[10] Vincent writes about how the only time she has ever been considered excessively feminine was during her stint as a man: her alter ego, Ned, was assumed to be gay on several occasions, and features which in her as a woman had been seen as “butch” became oddly effeminate when seen in a man. (She is a lesbian.) Vincent asserts that, since the experiment, she has never been more glad to be female.[8]



&gt;**Voluntary Madness**

&gt;Her most recent book is Voluntary Madness, about her experiences as an inpatient in three different mental hospitals. Suffering from depression after her eighteen months living disguised as a man, Vincent felt she was a danger to herself. On the advice of her psychologist she committed herself to a mental institution. She spent time in three different institutions – one urban, public and ill-funded; one small-town; and one private and expensive. She found some parts of the mental health care system beset by arrogant doctors and  over-reliance on drugs as therapy, while others addressed merely the symptoms instead of their underlying causes.

&gt;Although Vincent did not gain access to the hospital by means of deception, her exposé can be compared to Ten Days in a Mad-House by undercover reporter Nellie Bly, written more than a century previously (1887). The Rosenhan experiment in the 1970s also provides a comparison of life inside several mental hospitals.

true,andthisiswhathe,null,null,"&gt;1) Lukaku is 20. Most strikers peak at 25. That means he has 5 more years to become consistent.

Yes, but if a player doesn't have the talent, he doesn't have the talent. There are some things that do not drastically improve after the age of 18-21. It's not a criticism of Lukaku, it's just the nature of human beings. Some people can do things that others cannot and in my opinion, Lukaku will never have the technical ability to play in the enclosed spaces that defences we play against create. I'd say most strikers peak at later than 25 anyway.

&gt;2) He is big enough striker when we need more aerial presence in the box. Not everyone needs to dribble through 3 defenders. We need different playstyle for different days.

Maybe. A good striker is a good striker. But I actually don't think that Lukaku makes the most of his size. In the air that is.

&gt;3) We sold Sturridge before he came good, same with Matic. We can't afford to make similar mistake, if we want to attract youth talent.

But we also sold a boat load of talent for a fair amount when it became clear that they would never be good enough. For every Sturridge or Matic, there's a Jacopo Sala, Gokhan Tore, Miroslav Stoch, Kevin De Bruyne, Michael Mancienne and so on.

&gt;4) Lukaku has never given a chance in Chelsea team. We should at the very least give him 10 starts before questioning him.

Why? If we don't think that he's good enough, why play him at all? What about his performances in training? Why is 10 games the magical point at which we have an almighty realisation about a player's talent? Why not 15? Or 25? Or 3?

&gt;5) He is able to outmuscle even the strongest defences, as apparent in last season against United.

Not much good if he's technically deficient, which I believe he is. It's all very well being able to outmuscle players but if you're not good enough at football, what's the point? You're essentially left with Ade Akinbiyi.

&gt;6) He has scored more goals than any of Chelsea's striker this season and that's his off season.

And? Players that have scored a similar number as him in the league this season: Jay Rodriguez, Olivier Giroud, Emmanuel Adebayor, Christian Benteke, Wilfried Bony, Rickie Lambert. That's his level at the moment.

&gt;So, for the love of god, stop suggesting that we should sell him. We are not going to sell him at all, not for next 2 years, unless the management is stupid. Sure, he hasn't light the world on fire like Costa or Lewandowski, but he is talented as hell. Stop being so fickle please, and understand he is important for us in long term.

I really dislike hand-wringing, preaching end statements like these. We've seen him in England for what, three years now? It seems to me to be the complete opposite of fickleness. People are allowed different opinions on the merits and failings of players. 

Unless he suddenly develops a level of technical skill that he currently does not possess then I don't think that he'll ever be good enough for Chelsea. ",0,1392979621,null,0,false,0,cfkxc38,t3_1yixgv,t1_cfkxc38,t3_1yixgv,null,1432494330,33,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,33

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; Basically, we bought an in-the-box striker and forced him to adapt to our slow, methodical system. Then changed everything and brought in a new system that suits his old playing style.

The one thing I absolutely don't buy is that Soldado has ""forgotten"" to play the way he did his whole career in Valencia after half a year in Tottenham..  This is the man who was rated one of the 8(?) most effective strikers in Europe for the past five years when he turned up at the lane. Running at defenses is what he has always done, since his Castilla days. 

Let me put it this way, say you first learn to drive with an automatic transmission - everything goes smoothly and all you need to do is just gas and brake. But then you get a car with stick gear, you're still doing the same thing, but everything is new, harder and bumpy. Nevertheless, you adapt and learn how to handle it.. Then suddenly, you're back in an automatic, and you've forgotten how to drive it?! That's just not how it works!
 
In this shitty metaphor Valencia and Spurs with Tim is the automatic and AVB's Spurs  is the stick.

Make sure you're registered on [Spotlight](http://www.spotlight.com) or you won't be taken seriously and sign up to [Casting Call Pro](http://www.castingcallpro.com/uk/) for a few months to get some work you can showcase yourself in. As to the who, that depends what you're after. The big boys list varies but tends to include Hamilton Hoddell, United, Troika, Conway Van Gelder, Felix de Wolfe and Independent. There are many many others and it may suit you better to pursue a boutique agency or someone who specialises in whatever it is you specialise in. Then there are co-operative agencies (google Actorum, Actors Alliance for instance) where the actors represent themselves and act as agent once a week or once a month. Nobody's going to give you a definitive list of who's in or out, largely because there's so many people pursuing the same thing you are and it can change so quickly.

You're better off focusing on casting directors and getting them to see you, they're the ones who will get you the work.

true,alexgmcm,eng-sussex,Sussex,"Because there are different jobs in CS.

For example I did Physics and am now on a Masters program at a CS department and focusing on machine learning.

We don't do that much programming really, but we do loads of linear algebra and probability theory and statistics. And data scientists and analysts are in quite high demand plus it is also useful for AI and robotics.

Working in CS doesn't necessarily mean being a C# or Java engineer.

EDIT: I realise initially this may have sounded dismissive - that wasn't meant to be the case. I believe that software engineering and computer science are different sets of skills (and that I lack software engineering skills due to my primarily mathematical and academic background in Physics).

Learning how to efficiently work in a large department on an huge enterprise project is entirely different than working with only a few other people (sometimes alone) to implement algorithms.

Such a distinction was made by the polytechnics and now sadly both the more vocational engineering style courses and the more academic style ones have both been labelled computer science which is confusing to everyone involved and can only lead both employers and students to be left unsatisfied. (As some employers will expect a lot of mathematical rigour, some want people ready to work from day one, and some students prefer the more vocational topics to the mathematical ones and vice versa.)

true,socialcrap,null,null,"Good response. I was expecting someone to provide good retort. Anyway, let's dive in, shall we.

1) Talent? Afaik, Lukaku is far more talented than most of other striker prospect that we have. Again, talent is not just dribbling. When it comes to finish, lukaku is pretty good. Of course, he will never improve his technical ability to be considered a fluid player. But, we need a bully as well, and he has the ability to be one. 

2) Again, compared to our options, who would you think is our best bet in the air? Lukaku is far from finished product, for sure, but still our best prospect. 

3) First off, don't include kdb in list of failures. He might end up as one, but as of today, he is still pretty good. Second, it is not just about selling. It is about selling without giving them a fair chance. Not getting a chance at all, before being sold, is not a good sign for attracting youth talent. We can't lure everyone by using Roman's money. 

4) There is no magic number of appearances. But, we need to play him for few games, right? Without that, how can we judge if he will fit perfectly. He was scouted as a possible candidate, right. When is the time to give them a trial run then? You can't hire any player and expect results from day 1. And remember, drogba wasn't doing any special when he joined us, but he was a perfect fit here. Think of Lukaku not as a youth talent, but a new transfer. What would you expect to be a fair amount of appearances then?

5) I have mentioned it multiple times today. We don't always play the same fluid front 4. We need different style for different times. Also, Lukaku is not technically deficient compared to his peers. He is still very good at reading the game. Only thing he suck at, is ball control, which isn't much use if we play from wings. Depending on play style, he can be the best or just average. 

6) Remember when people wanted to buy Benteke? Or that Benteke single handedly made Villa competitive, last year. Or the fact that Giroud leads the line for arsenal? if that's the level of Lukaku at age of 20, I am sure, he can lead Chelsea in cup games. We are not talking about form, but the talent. Lukaku's off season is as good as Benteke or Giroud, right? What about the time when he is in-form? Being as good as rival's first striker, during off-season is not good enough for us? 

It is not preachy. It is a simple statement of the fact, that during summer, everyone was looking for him to lead the line or be our second striker at the very least. Your argument is about not improving technical skills, right? Wasn't that the case in summer as well? Then why the hell were we not talking about it then? Why are we talking about it when he failed to perform for 2 months? Is it because everyone suddenly start to understand football? or is it simply because fans are over the honeymoon period? 

if you have made similar argument about his skills, last year, it would have made more sense. as of now, this sub feels like a bored housewife looking for a new affair. that's why those end statement feel preachy.

Even if your party doesn't win, votes mean people and the media will listen, and they may still be able to change the course of government policy through opposition.

true,the_ultravixens,null,null,"Crunching the numbers, we had 63 million population in 2011 census, in 1981 the population was around 56 million.  Let's coarsely assume 50% are male.  The rates per 100,000 in 1981 was about 14.6, and using 2012 figures we get exactly the same rate of 14.6.  So the worst we can say is that things are about the same as they were in 1981.  But that's just using two random data points, 30 years apart, which tells us nothing.

The author's entire article is basically based on 2 data points, and that appears to be all the research that he's done, which is fucking shocking.  If he'd cared to dig a bit he would have found this article on the bmj, with much more data on suicide rates over the last 50 years:

http://www.bmj.com/content/336/7643/539

This shows that male suicide rates peaked in the mid/late 90's, and have been raipdly falling over the last decade or so.  Up to date figures from the samaritans available here (http://www.samaritans.org/sites/default/files/kcfinder/files/research/Samaritans%20Suicide%20Statistics%20Report%202013.pdf) show that rates were falling to about 2007, and have risen slightly since the recession, which I don't think is surprising.

It's also interesting to note from the bmj data that women's rates have remained largely constant, wobbling around about 6/100,000.  There's maybe a slow decline in there, but it's not very steep.

I draw the following conclusions:

1) things have improved greatly for male suicide prevention in the last 10 years and that presumably the relevant bodies/services should be praised.  

2) Women's suicide rates have remained largely constant.

We had to sacrifice city living, though. We'd always rented round Mill/Cromwell Road, but when it came time to buy we ended up out in Soham. 


We sold that house in Sept 2012, pretty much for what we paid for it, with the market being what it was then. We certainly didn't have any of this crap the CEN are on about, where we were overwhelmed with viewings - we had a really steady flow, and our house sold in a week (in terms of us accepting an offer). We now live 4 miles from the centre of town, but again, we'd never have been able to do so without a really big deposit which came from selling a property I had up north, and using the entire proceeds as the deposit. Added to this, we're in a lovely village, in an old former council estate, so house prices are slightly more affordable as it's still (erooneously) seen as the less-desirable side. It's been perfectly fine in the 18 months we've been there - we have fields at the back, all of our neighbours are retired and lovely, chatty folks, we're at the back of the cul-de-sac so it's very quiet, and we're close enough to town to either catch a train (5 min journey), drive in (15 mins) or cycle (20 mins). 


Shame is, the village areas on the outskirts of the city get overlooked, but we're only in our 30s with no kids, and haven't found it to be a 'dead zone'.

Watch the Everton game today, or go back and watch the Everton games through the rest of the season. His first touch isn't amazing. He acts like a 20 year old on the field. That's not ment as a compliment. His work rate is OK at best.

Eto'o has put in a similiar, if not better, performance to Lukaku this year and yet people don't care if he's leaving or not.

I think this is a line that's just wheeled out to try to cover up the issues. The fact that a large portion of graduates can't find any gainful employment let alone employment in an ideal career path is a problem. The problem isn't caused by people studying media studies.

There's four large factors:

* increase in supply of new graduates (internationally) 
* decrease in people leaving roles (both to create their own companies or retire)
* long term increases in productivity (one man + a pc can do the work of a team of people 10 years ago)
* temporary depressed demand because of economic policy/international economic situation

Doesn't matter if you have a STEM degree or media studies degree really, these factors will affect you.

I think the issue is that the current generation of graduates probably have a belief (wrongly) that hard work = result. The fact is, hard work + circumstances = result. The circumstances of your life includes the above factors, which you have no control over and you just have to go with it. 

There probably is an element of unfairness in that the government DOES have an influence on some of those factors, and may enact policies which help or hinder.

Then again, I guess the mantra 'life isn't fair' is important to remember. It's not just media studies graduates - in the US for example there is a growing problem for computer software engineers for example. Nobody cares about a mediocre or okay software engineer when you can recruit exceptional software engineers endlessly from all over the world.

In the UK even we have a shortage of medics but because it's easier to import experienced staff we have UK medical graduates (all education paid for at expense) going abroad to try to find work.

Taxation income and/or other welfare cuts.

&gt;personally, I have an OK job that I quite like doing, but as soon as I can survive on guaranteed basic income, I'm not going to be working very much (if at all). I'll be gardening, exercising, learning, sleeping etc.

That's your prerogative. Some people would prefer the extra cash for doing the unpleasant jobs, some people would prefer the extra time for gardening or exercising.

If nobody could be found to do the unpleasant job at £x/hour, then the job isn't worth doing at £x/h. So either the rate must increase (if the job is worth doing at £x+[increase]/h or the job doesn't create enough value.

So for example, a worthless job like a street-sign holder for McD's would probably be dropped.

&gt;

&gt;In anatomy, **heterochromia** (Greek: heteros 'different' + chroma 'color' ) is a difference in [coloration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color), usually of the [iris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy\)) but also of [hair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair) or [skin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin). Heterochromia is a result of the relative excess or lack of [melanin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin) (a [pigment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment)). It may be [inherited](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_inheritance), or caused by genetic [mosaicism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaicism), [chimerism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimerism), [disease](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease), or [injury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury). 

&gt;Heterochromia of the [eye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye) (**heterochromia iridis** or **heterochromia iridum**; the common incorrect form ""heterochromia irid**i**um"" is not correct [Latin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin)) is of two kinds. In complete heterochromia, one iris is a different color from the other. In partial heterochromia or sectoral heterochromia, part of one iris is a different color from its remainder.

&gt;[Eye color](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_color), specifically the color of the irises, is determined primarily by the concentration and distribution of melanin.    The affected eye may be hyperpigmented (hyperchromic) or hypopigmented (hypochromic).  In humans, usually, an excess of melanin indicates [hyperplasia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplasia) of the [iris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(anatomy\)) tissues, whereas a lack of [melanin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin) indicates hypoplasia.

I saw my first episodes of Doctor Who while I was homeless. I would crash with friends or lovers sometimes, and on one occasion, she talked me into watching The Stolen Earth and Journey's End. I had no idea who all these people were, but I liked them. I liked the Doctor especially.

I forgot about it for a while after she was killed.

I finally found housing... but it was a halfway house that accepted the homeless on occasion. I spent most of my days hiding in an apartment the size of a bedroom, surrounded by prostitutes, violent offenders, habitual drug users and thieves. But I had a computer thanks to my family, and internet... and I found Doctor Who again. Even in the middle of all that darkness, the Doctor gave me a bright point to cling to. I could relate to him... he had lost everything, and those dear to him, and still found a way to smile and enjoy life. During that time I found a local theater that would play the episodes on the big screen for free. The more I watched, the more I loved it. I loved the Doctor. I went back and watched the Ninth Doctor, but Tennant was amazing to me.

Then came The End of Time, and some kid took over. I hated him. How dare he think that he could come in and be all goofy and odd and... kind of funny and... rather delightful... within a season, I loved Doctor Who all over again. The show was different, yes, but it was like ice cream! A different flavor didn't make the last flavor bad!

Then it happened. Vincent and the Doctor. As a creative person who suffers from mental illness, the episode managed to touch so much inside of me. Everyone was masterful in the episode, and the Doctor once again managed to show me the brightness in what had felt like an endless dark tunnel that my life was trapped in.

I finally moved out, into a real apartment. The hellish days were past, and I could start the healing process. Still there was the Doctor, and fezzes, and trowels, and strange cubes, and a toothbrush mistaken for a sonic screwdriver, and... and... everything. I still lived near that theater, and I was there every episode. I was surrounded by not only Who, but Whovians... not just fans, but a community the likes of which I had never seen.

The Name of the Doctor. The Day of the Doctor. Finally... the Time of the Doctor. I sat in the packed theater... ""I will always remember when the Doctor was me."" I cried. I cried so hard. And he changed again. Once again I will see the show I love change flavors,

Why do I like Doctor Who? It's the brightest star in my sky. It's reminder of who and what came before, a community to be a part of now, and more days to come that I will do my best to meet with the wonder and curiosity that he has shown.

Not in the limited studies carried out so far.

&gt;Of course, maybe some people would choose to carry on working to get extra perks but **I bet** vast swathes of the population wouldn't.

Your betting is interesting, but the studies we've done so far indicate it's between 0-5% drop in hours worked, rather than vast swathes of the population sitting out. 

Look at it this way: if basic income was £7500 (about what a pensioner gets) you can live off £145 a week, but it's not super comfortable. If you take an 10 hours/week at McDs and boost your income by 33% everyone wins.

Similarly, you don't *need* to save for retirement, but you're going to be living off £145 / week. I want more than that for my retirement, so I choose to save. Just because there's a safety net there, it doesn't remove my *aspirations*. Why would it?

&gt;You can't just pay people more because then you would end up with inflation which would quickly eat into the guaranteed basic income and make it insufficient to live on.

You're not paying people more though, basic income isn't printing money and giving it out, it's redistribution.

So in the spirit of a 4-3-3:

Goalkeeper
Either Courtois or Cech is out, which is ridiculous to say, but I get the feeling its true. Can’t have two type A guys around fighting for time. My heart goes with Cech but my brain says Courtois. Happy with either.

Left Back
Out: Ashley Cole – presumably MLS for free, Red Bulls are the rumor
In: Luke Shaw – over paying for an English player, but he at least has potential unlike other overpriced English players (see Andy Carroll)

Center Back
No Changes 

Right Back
No Changes

Center Mid
Out: Mikel – Great Defensively, Useless going elsewhere (unless he’s playing for Nigeria conspicuously). With MVG coming back from injury, the ability to use the Geezer in Mid, and plenty of use prospects, seems like a sell 
In: None – use the kids for depth

Attacking Mid
Out: Marin – Panic Buy, not good enough for the squad
Moses – Potential, but surplus to requirements – would fancy him at Everton
In: Someone – yea its non-descript, but watching Mou for years, I say it’s a lefty for squad depth. Maybe he calls Robben back, who knows. Just a gut feeling

Striker
In: Cavani – Seems obvious at this point, complete package for Mou squad. Costa is trouble waiting to happen and Falcao is a FM or FIFA dream.
Out: Ba – Like Moses, not bad, but surplus
Eto’o – Think he already agreed to sign for the Spanish club his son fancies. Good coverage for the year while the Torres saga continues.

The reality remains, that a number of departments within certain country council had their budgets cut, I know for a fact that Derby City Council was one.

The problem is the ambiguity about flexible timing. For example, when exactly does off-peak time start? They need a much better way of looking that kind of thing up.

true,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"&gt; Standard pensions work well when you can pump enough money into them, and are over a certain age and your employer matches what you put in.

That's not true at all. The younger you are the more you gain through compounding and because it's all tax free you don't pay a penny on your gains -- until drawing on your pension. If you put £100 per month into a pension from the age of 20 your pension will be worth more than if you put £200 per month in from age 35. Younger = better.

&gt; For the vast majority of my peers - we have none of this. We earn modest salaries, see huge amounts of it vanish in tax, and have to contend with building families on incomes that don't stretch far.

Pension contributions have huge tax advantages because they allow you to reduce your taxable income and then on top of that the government will give you 20% tax relief (assuming basic rate tax payer). If tax is a concern for you then pensions are great!

&gt; With management fees eating up small rates of return anyway, the cost of living (and tax) being where it is, saving for a conventional pension just doesn't work for me.

That doesn't make any sense: management fees are a fact of life if you invest *anywhere* (which you need to do to increase your wealth or it'll be eroded by inflation) and the management fees for any good pension product are very low, mine is around 0.25%. Tax is a good reason *for* using pensions, instead of paying tax on £25,000 income, you can put £5000 into your pension, pay tax on only £20,000 of income.

&gt; As far as I'm PERSONALLY concerned, putting that same cash in a pension fund would be equal to flushing it down the drain.

That doesn't make any logical sense. I fear that perhaps you've heard from family members who had pensions back in the 70s and 80s when misselling was rampant and they've suffered because of bad advice. Nowadays pensions are highly regulated, misselling is a thing of the past and thanks to tax relief pensions provide huge gains even without good investments.

If you believe that pensions are not right for you that is absolutely okay, however the things you've said indicate you're driven by fear and you don't fully understand how pensions work *now*. I highly recommend you spend some time researching them and learning, perhaps at the end you'll remain convinced that they're not right for you but I highly suspect you'll change your mind.",0,1392996536,null,0,1393014121,0,cfl1jdx,t3_1yj244,t1_cfl1jdx,t1_cfl13hd,null,1432496310,7,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,7

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"&gt;So the cost of this is £450 billion. 

Well, maybe. Maybe not. At this stage it's an idea that's being discussed, who knows what the right level is. Some say it should be a bare minimum, equivalent to say the £50 JSA people get just so they can afford bread and water. Others say it should be enough to take part in society with a few luxuries. What do you think? I think £145 or the level of the basic pension is about right for a starting point. I don't think children should receive it either. But, that's my view. 

In a similar vein we could argue about how much a prescription should cost no? Should the patient pay for all, some, or none of their treatment, as the NHS will have to pay the rest and that costs money which means more tax. I'm not trying to cop out by the way - I'm trying to be honest with you.

No pensions will have been stolen, the state pension is paid for out of general taxation the same as the NHS is or the MoD is. Private pensions would remain people's private pensions.

&gt;That leaves £300 billion in new tax revenue to find (plus to be sustainable, we'd need to think about the existing £115 billion budget deficit).

Well that depends on the figures decided upon. It has to be costed up, and as I'm in the fortunate position of not being the chancellor of the exchequer, I am not going to the costings myself.

The budget deficit is a different factor altogether. 

&gt; moderate to high earners so much that they decide to stop working too

This doesn't really make sense. It's likely that there wouldn't be tiers of tax bands but rather a flat income tax rate for everyone. If income tax was a flat 55%, why would anyone decide to earn 45% of £0 instead of 45% of £75,000? If they didn't want to work for that, then there are plenty of people who would, or else the job like the previous example did not pay enough to compensate for the work and there are more important things for people to do with their time.",0,1392997233,null,0,false,0,cfl1tm5,t3_1ygfgz,t1_cfl1tm5,t1_cfl0tq6,null,1432496444,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Europhiles should wreck it, I have no idea why we live under the presumption that ""most people"" are euroskeptic.... I don't even really understand what they're actually skeptical about. Is it the CAP? I can agree with that.... what else?  

&gt; ""Oh but its not very democratic yet""

Well neither is fucking FPTP but _only_ the Lib Dems have ever said anything about that. If we genuinely care about democracy then why don't we deal with the issue at home first? If we had proportional rep and joining the EU was going to take that away then that would make sense but that's not the case.

All I typically hear is ""immigrants, benefits.... yada, yada"". Its not interesting, its not especially relevant, its not an interesting future to discuss nor is it usually factually accurate. Beyond that what do we have?

First of all, only *some* of the protestors are nationalist, most of them are not. Buying into Russian propaganda about the threat of Nazis and homogenizing the protestors is a surefire way to justify state-based violence against citizens. 

Second, nationalism is not the same thing as fascism. The existence of fascism requires an authoritarian, dictatorial regime tied to nationalism. Yanukovych exemplifies this by eliminating executive checks on authority and banning freedom of speech and assembly. Obviously, the protestors are not authoritarian (they don't control the military) and aren't a dictatorship (a group of people without state power is the antithesis of being a dictator). 

Third, claiming that there are a few bad apples in the protest doesn't justify the continued existence of a clearly fascist administration. You have no defense of Yanukovych's policies or the fact that his police/military brigades are killing citizens. 

Just so we're clear, I'm not saying that every protester is a pure-hearted vigilante of peace.

true,FoKFill,null,null,"&gt; But nobody can really ever seem to provide a rational argument as to why it should be legalised (beyond the ""if tabacco is legal, so should this"" line.)

The question is incorrectly asked. The standard of things isn't to ban them, else we would ban everything in the world, and then after we can prove that they are benficial, we can un-ban them. it's the prohibitionists who need to justify their position. And they usually do that in the following ways:

We don't want kids to use it: Neither do legalizers, just the opposite. With a huge black market, dealers don't care about age limits. If we legalize and regulate it, we will shrink the black market and their oppertunities to sell to kids.

It's bad for you: It *can* be bad for you, but should be ban everything that can harm you? Sports, alcohol, tobacco, even free speech can be bad. And we are finding more and more ways it can be *good* for you.

We want less abusers: So do we! But if we criminalize use, people will be afraid to go to the doctor if they encounter problems. Should we make cancer illegal? Would that help cancer patients? Should we make it illegal to do self-harm (like cutting yourself)? Do you think less people would do it, and more people would seek help for it (though this part is more about decriminalizing use).

And in short: prohibition just hasn't worked; it's more available than ever, and the price is lower than ever.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"&gt; Couldn't you say the same for most senior politicians? 

I would argue no, not really.

George Osborne was voted in with a 54% majority in 2010 for his constituency. Ultimately he gets a lot of hate for the job he has, but he is an elected MP for Tatton and his role as Chancellor is part of his job in the cabinet. As much as people like to latch onto him as a hate figure, it if weren't him it would only be someone else. His role as chancellor is to enforce the governments spending plans on the various departments... but that isn't to say he is necessarily the architect of those plans, any more than the rest of the cabinet. Basically, its a case of don't hate the player - hate the game (austerity). 

Gordon Browns slip into power was pretty cheeky as far as democracy goes and I'll grant that one... but it is still slightly different in a very important way.... 

The thing that makes the situation with Clegg different is that people actually had a choice to vote for him (whereas with Brown they just got him regardless of what they wanted for the remainder of someone else's term), and the vast majority of people choose not to vote for Clegg when given that choice. So to end up with him in the theoretically second highest office in government is pretty ironic, especially if it were to happen for 10 years. It means the man with the least democratic mandate can act as kingmaker again - and if you recall his price last time was pretty high, as he held Cameron to ransom over the AV vote. Of course now AV is lauded as a great LD failure and a huge Tory coup, but actually at the time it was an extraordinarily risky strategy on the part of Cameron, because the result of the AV referendum was not a foregone conclusion... and indeed part of the reason AV failed to gain traction was due to the *Cleggmania* backlash amongst voters who were angry at his imperious attitude following the election.",0,1392999087,null,0,1392999410,0,cfl2m10,t3_1yizi5,t1_cfl2m10,t1_cfl1lic,null,1432496816,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

Some of the line ups I use MAY NOT sound conventional, but they work, I will post them from least to most effective to ME. I recently started focusing on Seasons and have won 6 of the 6 season titles available, I am level 69 on FIFA and I rarely lose...though my last 4-5 games I have had horrible luck scoring...ANYWAYS here they are:


 ------------------------HART-----------------------

Zabaleta-------Kompany-------Demichellis---------Clichy

-------------------------Toure----------------------

Navas-------------------Silva-------------------Nasri

-----------Aguero-------------------Jovetic----------

This is my ultra offensive line up, I sub Nasri for Milner and Jovetic for  Negredo if need be. Silva for Dinho.

However I found that in more competitive matches and with City's Amazing Midfield at my disposal I instead started using a 4-2-2-2. Also Demichellis kind of sucks, and Lescott is no better, they are both slow as hell... both to react in the air and to run back and defend against the likes of Ronaldo and Messi (Since most people out there only use Madrid -mostly- and Barca) SO I started using Kolarov as a CB. Because most people I play against overplay the cross I need a fast LB or RB, so I definately need Clichy, he has never left me astray so I always use him. Also I play Nasri from the beginning instead of Navas, though Navas is fast as hell he is not so effective and as offensive as Nasri (at least the way I play) but I do sub him in during the 55th-70th min. ANWAYS my most effective Line up so Far:

----------------------Hart-----------------------

Zaba-------Kompany------Kolarov-----------Clichy

----------Toure----------Dinho-------------------

Silva---------------------------------------Nasri

----------Aguero--------------Jovetic------------

I'd like to see a guaranteed basic income as much (ok, almost as much) as anyone. 

But rather than vague ""more taxes"" arguments lets get down to specifics over how it would be paid for.

At the £7.5K per person suggested with 50 million over the age of 16 that's £394 billion. 

Refining my budget figures used in other comments using [this chart](http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2013/jan/08/uk-benefit-welfare-spending) let's say that £70 ~~m~~billion can be applied from the DWP budget instead to a basic income.

That leaves £330 billion to find from extra taxation. Total UK taxation was apparently £469 billion, so we ""just"" need to approximately double tax revenues.

We're not talking about tweaks and adjustments here, it's double VAT, double income tax for moderate to higher earners, double corporation and capital gains tax etc etc. 

And that's just for £7.5K

I'm coming at this from the perspective of ""I'd like a guarantee basic income, it will be *essential* in some form in the next 10 - 20 years, but lets have a proper discussion, not vague generalisations and arm waving"".

I'm going to do it for other EPL/CL teams if there's interest. I know there are probably some other places where you can see this stuff but I didn't find anywhere on twitter itself where you can just follow one account and get everyone's updates so I figured why not. 

For the record, I'm an Arsenal fan, but if Arsenal wasn't around, I'd be cheering with you guys.  Suarez - fucking beast, Gerrard - legend, Rogers - badass.  Def rooting for you guys to finish 2nd, behind Arsenal ;)

---

&gt;

&gt;**Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death** (commonly shortened to **The Curse of Fatal Death**) is a four-episode special of Doctor Who made for the [Red Nose Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Relief_(charity\)) charity [telethon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telethon) in the United Kingdom, and broadcast on [BBC One](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_One) on 12 March 1999. It follows in a long tradition of popular British television programmes producing short, light-hearted specials for such telethon events.

&gt;It has a special status amongst Doctor Who-themed charity productions. It has twice been featured on the cover of Doctor Who Magazine  - an unusual feat even for a regular episode of the programme. It is the only [parodic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody) story to be covered by ""DWM Archives"", a section of DWM normally reserved for discussion of past episodes of the regular series. Similarly, it is the only parody to be given an extensive behind-the-scenes article on the BBC official website,  and its own video release through BBC Video. It is also the only BBC-commissioned [live-action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live-action) Doctor Who production between [the Doctor Who television movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(1996_film\)) and [""Rose""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(Doctor_Who_episode\)).

&gt;Finally, it serves as a production bridge - if not a narrative bridge - between the 1963 and 2005 versions of the programme. Most notable amongst the many connections between ""old"" and ""new"" versions is the fact that it showcases the first televised Doctor Who script by [Steven Moffat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Moffat), the first post-production work of [The Mill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mill_(post-production\)) on the programme, the only time a woman produced an episode of the programme between [Verity Lambert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verity_Lambert) and [Susie Liggat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susie_Liggat), and the final performance by the longest-serving Dalek vocal artist, [Roy Skelton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Skelton). Executive Producer [Richard Curtis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Curtis) would later write the 2010 episode ""[Vincent and the Doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_and_the_Doctor)"". [Richard E.

&gt;

&gt;A **crannog**      (/ˈkrænəɡ/; [Irish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): crannóg [ˈkɾˠan̪ˠoːɡ]; [Scottish Gaelic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Gaelic_language): crannag) is typically a partially or entirely [artificial island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_island), usually built in [lakes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake), [rivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River) and [estuarine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estuarine) waters of [Scotland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland) and [Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland). Unlike the [prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_pile_dwellings_around_the_Alps) which were built on the shores and were inundated only later on, crannogs were built in the water, thus forming artificial islands.

&gt;Crannogs were used as dwellings over five millennia, from the European Neolithic Period  to as late as the 17th/early 18th century,  although in Scotland there is currently no convincing evidence in the archaeological record of Early and Middle [Bronze Age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age) or Norse Period use. The earliest radiocarbon determinations obtained from key sites such as Oakbank in Loch Tay and Redcastle, Beauly Firth approach the Late Bronze Age - Early Iron Age transition at their widest interpretation [clarification needed] at 2 standard deviations or a 95.4% confidence level: they fall after around 800 BC and so could be considered Late Bronze Age by only the narrowest of margins.   Crannogs have been variously interpreted as free-standing wooden structures, as at Loch Tay,  although more commonly they exist as brush, stone or timber mounds which can be [revetted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revetment) with timber piles. However, in areas such as the Western Isles of Scotland, timber was unavailable from the Neolithic era onwards.  As a result, completely stone crannogs supporting drystone architecture are common here.  Today, crannogs typically appear as small, circular islets, often 10 to 30 metres (30 to 100 ft) in diameter, covered in dense vegetation due to their inaccessibility to grazing livestock.

Expecting people with these needs to downsize is ludicrous, as is expecting them to cover a shortfall in their rent when a) They can't work and b) There are already huge financial burdens on these people that able bodied people simply don't have.

That said, I think it is essential that this issue is dealt with on a case by case basis. I realise that some people have been successful in their appeals and have been granted an exemption. For instance, the rest of the property should be taken into account when deciding if they need the second bedroom, like if they have a large utility room connected to their kitchen (As my auntie has), they probably don't need a second bedroom to store a single wheelchair. I think we should give the judge the benefit of the doubt here as I think he knew more about the individual circumstances than we do.

true,beIIe-and-sebastian,null,null,"&gt;DJ Chris Moyles claimed to be a second-hand car dealer in a bid to save up to £1 million in tax, a tribunal has found.

&gt;A tax court named Moyles and two other men as having taking part in a scheme called “working wheels” which counted “450 fund managers, celebrities and other high earners between 2006 and 2008” as members.

&gt;The scheme worked by allowing its members to say they had incurred large fees while working in the second-hand car trade which they could claim back against their tax bill.

&gt;A published judgment from the Tax Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal said Moyles’s self-assessment tax return for the financial year ending on April 5, 2008, when he was presenting Radio One’s Breakfast Show, said he “had engaged in self-employment as a used car trader”.

&gt;Moyles did not give evidence directly to the tribunal but did submit “a brief witness statement”.

&gt;The tribunal, under Judge Colin Bishopp, described that evidence as “very brief and rather uninformative”.

&gt;The judgment said: “It is however quite clear from the statement that he too entered the scheme for no purpose other than to achieve a tax saving, and that he took no interest in the trade.”

&gt;It went on to say that Moyles was “anxious to be reassured that the scheme was lawful, and that he would not have to undertake any trading himself”.

&gt;It said his accountant, a Mr Smith, had “agreed that the scale of Moyles’s borrowing was driven solely by the amount of the tax loss he wanted to achieve, in his case £1 million, and that the trading was not carried on for its own sake but was merely a means to an end”.

&gt;Exchequer Secretary David Gauke said: “This case is another example of why taxpayers should not fall for the promises of promoters selling schemes that are all too often too good to be true. Not only will the taxpayer waste money on the fees for these failed schemes, they will still have to pay all the tax, interest and penalties that are due.

&gt;“This Government has provided HMRC with the resources to tackle these avoidance schemes and HMRC will now pursue the other users of the scheme to make sure all the taxes that are due are paid.”",0,1393007314,null,0,false,0,cfl6dq9,t3_1yjxy3,t1_cfl6dq9,t1_cfl6ag6,null,1432498659,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23

A public entertainment license is a *legal requirement* from the City of Edinburgh Council; you cannot put on the event - free or otherwise - without it.

&gt; I bet €4.99, people will still turn up and have a better time for not paying and not being told where to stand.

Right, and when Calton Hill is over capacity, and when the Police have to clear the hill on the grounds of public safety, and when people actually die due to no stewarding or ambulance provision (there have been medical emergencies there before) and the organisers are prosecuted, and when there is no event in the future... yeah, no.

I don't think you understand the amount of organisation that goes into running an event of this scale, or the amount of legal red tape and hoops that people have to jump through with the authorities.

People think long and hard about running events like this and there is simply no option but to charge, or else the event cannot go ahead.

I bet you are one of the people that look at the face value of the ticket, multiply it by the 10,000 capacity of Calton Hill and think that everybody involved must be fucking rolling in cash.

Lots of people are living less comfortable lives, with less spare income, but does that mean they need food banks? If you offer a service where you give people free food, obviously there is going to be demand for that, but it doesn't mean more people absolutely need that charity.  

10 years ago, there weren't many big chain coffee shops on the high street, now there everywhere, and its not because everyone suddenly became addicted to coffee and so there was a demand for them. Its because they opened one after another, as people realised they liked their service.

All YOU gotta do is figure out WHICH EPISODE. Not an easy feat I know...but easier than you think. All you've gotta do is ask yourself a few questions...

What shows does she currently watch? What are the elements of the show that make her want to watch? Comedy, romance, drama....

What else is she into? Books? What does she read? 

After you compile your data, look at each season, read the episodes synopsis &amp; find episodes that have elements of the things you KNOW she likes...Then casually have THAT episode playing one evening, don't TELL HER what it is. Usually, not always, this works. Before you know it, someone who feigns no interest in the Doctor or ""hates"" (shudder...how could they???) the Doctor begins watching ""unawares"" and BOOM, you let the Doctor do the real work &amp; they get hooked. 

I used this on a friend of mine, female, hated the show but could never give me a concrete reason WHY. So, I tried a different tactic. Worked. 

**No representation is made about the quality of this advice when performed on your subject or the expertise of the person supplying said advice/services therein**

But hey, it can't hurt anything to try:) 

As a card carrying female, I find my favorite episodes are:
Rose
The Empty Child/The Doctor Dances

School Reunion
The Girl in the Fireplace
Human Nature/Family of Blood

The Eleventh Hour
The Beast Below
Vincent and the Doctor

Just a few from each of the doctors from the reboot...there are some good episodes in Classic Who, but if she's so determined to not like it I hardly think Classic Who is the place to start....

~~~notice Blink isn't listed in my top favorites? It's a GREAT episode, but sometimes it won't do the job, not everyone likes it. Start with Human Nature/Family of Blood, if that fails, go to Vincent and the Doctor. One of those should resonate with most women~~~

This is fucking stupid. The government has mismanaged Customs and Immigration for quite a few years, and now we're at the point where both morale and training is at quite a shockingly low level for your average immigration officer.    

This has resulted in quite a few incidents including long queues, bad decisions being made (both in the positive and negative sense of entry), and high staff turnover. I mean in order to make the summer Olympics work they were just opening the floodgates and using unqualified staff at the gates.    

This scheme is a PR exercise. They should be rolling out training to detect slavery across the entire immigration officer workforce, not four officers per airport. What happens if someone trying to import a vulnerable person happens to pick one of the other immigration lines? Is stopping this just depending on luck that they'll pick the line with the one person on shift who has this new training?    

Slavery is a very political issue. This is the third or fourth new law they will be passing to combat it. And they have had some success there (but mostly with protecting people being **exported** into a bad situation, like forced marriage), slavery is actually quite low in the UK and new laws are unlikely to reduce it (although new *money* might).    

This whole announcement today is 100% political. If they wanted to do something practical (but expensive) they should look into immigration officer training, improve it substantially (even bring in trainers from abroad), improve pay/retention (so experience can play a larger part), and bake in anti-slavery/vulnerable person training as a standard piece of the pie.    

PS - Please don't think I am pro-slavery, or against programs to combat it or support victims. I do support anything constructive that can be done. I just find this announcement to be a rather cynical political move that likely won't have a positive impact on slavery in the UK.

The BBC is cutting-edge more often than not. As the world's largest broadcaster  it often has to find unique solutions. And the BBC's royal charter stipulates the obligation to innovate in broadcast technology.

A very small sample of the BBC's world-firsts:

The origins of the BBC lie in Marconi's 2MT, the world's first entertainment broadcasting service.    
First scheduled regular TV in the world    
Outside broadcasting (live and recorded, radio &amp; TV)    
Teletext    
noise-cancelling microphone    
Live-streaming of radio over the internet (R1 in the mid-1990s)     
First international broadcast of live Super-Hi Vision TV    
Live Transatlantic link-up.
