A lot of these guys have already made great points, so I'll touch on something that that gets me.  Over the last 4 years Villa has had exciting seasons - in many of the wrong ways.  But maybe that's just what got me hooked.

You'll never be lower than when your manager who clearly overspent walks off and leaves you on the doorstep of a new campaign.  Or when you've got to expel several of your highest paid players for being uncommitted to the team.  Or when with a budget in the top 10, you're fighting relegation - AGAIN.  Or when you can't win 2 matches at home.  Or continued rumors of having a bit too many drinks before training.  Or just knowing that THIS is the season where someone finally knocks us out of the premiership.

But you'll never get the same high as knocking Chelsea off the high horse with a dominant performance.  Or bringing in a Ligue 2 player to surpisingly keep you out of relegation.  Or making that unexpected cup run.  Or winning with 20% possession on the road (surprisingly often!).  Or welcoming back those who have done you wrong in the past.  Or keeping your star player around 2 more years when everyone was sure it wouldn't happen.

I'm not annoyed that she's pregnant. I'm annoyed that it's publicised as a top news story and slammed down our collective throats by an uncritical media. Nobody's pregnancy should be a top national news headline, and *only* royal pregnancies are. Focusing on the gestation of one child over all others promotes the concept of their *natural* superiority, which by deduction implies the inferiority of everybody else. Regardless of any media agenda - the consequence is free, positive PR for an unaccountable, hereditary elite.

It's not just about code. It's about understanding what's going on in those whirring boxes we use and carry around. It's about understanding not only how the things we use work, but how to make them work for us and work together.

As time goes on, more and more of the things people do on a daily basis manually are becoming automated. It will get to a point (it's not an if, it's a when) that a huge proportion of our lives will be managed by things that have been coded and designed. Our appliances will talk to each other, our jobs will be heavily influenced by and more involved with technology, our cars will drive themselves... there's no end to the examples I can reel off.

The important thing is, the generation currently going through school and the next generation will live into the 2100s and beyond. At the rate we've grown in the last half-a-century and the rate we're growing in terms of technology, the future job market will almost certainly require a much deeper understanding of IT.

Every day, new products become available that automate some element of our lives, be it personal/professional accounting, travel, entertainment, security... jobs are relying more and more on technology and people maintaining and managing that technology rather than manual labour.

So what?

That's not a problem that's solved by the two-party system.

Under the two-party system manifestos are broken *all the time*, and it doesn't matter because you only have to be *not worse* than one other party.

The labour party promised PR in each of their manifestos between 1997 and 2005 -  they served 3 terms in government, and broke that promise every time.

If there are any concrete promises in the Conservative 2010 manifesto ([here's a PDF](http://www.conservatives.com/~/media/files/activist%20centre/press%20and%20policy/manifestos/manifesto2010)) then I invite you to see for yourself how they've been broken. 

At least if the Socialist-Liberal party break their promises, in a PR system you can usefully vote for the Liberal-Socialists instead.

Nick Clegg dropped the ball big time - he really fucked up, and I don't blame people for being mad at him. Not only should you not be presenting that as the norm of european consensus politics, but you also shouldn't be presenting the two-party system as anything but utterly broken. Most of us in this country are being fucked over horribly.

I realise that. I subscribe to the theory of spending your way out of recession by investing in infrastructure. Seems to have worked in the past plenty of times. I also think that if you cut the working week and raised minimum wage, that would greatly increase tax revenue and lower unemployment.

I also think cost savings could be made by cutting military budget and simplifying the welfare system. A large amount extra could be recouped by closing tax loopholes - a lot of which I genuinely *do* believe would be quite straightforward to pursue, but the government don't actively pursue it because they don't want to scare away big business.

&gt;Raising minimum wage to £10-12/hr will cause problems. You'd have to do it very gradually. A more sensible approach would be to raise minimum wage in line with inflation.

I disagree, I think it needs a big hike to bring it in line with all the inflationary and cost of living increases that it's missed out on. After that it should be kept in line with inflation, sure.

That eventually improved with the likes of Crouch, Fowler again and later, Torres, but we never really scored in buckets like we do now.

Fast forward 8-10 years and we've done the exact opposite under Rodgers. He built what looks like could be a world class team from front to back, in that order.

I'm open to the idea that there's a relationship between pakistani-muslim sex offenders and their culture, but the recent reaction on Reddit (and elsewhere on the net) is not very measured.

We've got 10 or 100 men in a population of 10,000 or 100,000 and suddenly it's  ""muslim culture"" to blame. You're right to point out the uninvolvement of african and middle-eastern muslim men (so far), but the reaction on Reddit is like it's every muslim in Rotherham is at it (every pakistani muslim, if you prefer).

I honestly think it's far more likely that rapists are rapists, and their culture affects they way they commit their crimes. Obviously there's going to be some cultural variation, but I doubt there are orders of magnitude more rapists in any kind of UK community.

I've known several girls who've been raped, and I'm sure that in more than one case it was a boyfriend or someone they were dating - you'll get shot right down here on Reddit if you try to attribute date-rape to culture and the white community.

true,pepe_le_shoe,null,null,"&gt; How exactly is it a different country?

Warning, these are my opinions, read them and interpret them as such.

It is sort of culturally different to the rest of the UK, moreso in comparison with non-urban areas. Other large cities have more in common, however London is still significantly different that living there feels very distinctly different to living in other UK cities. 

London has a lot more positive cultural diversity. I have encountered little to no racism since moving to London, whereas I have encountered plenty of it everywhere else I have lived in the UK. The pace of life is also that much faster, for better or worse. To outsiders, for example, the tube is a rickety old menace, to those of us who live here, the idea of living elsewhere in the UK evokes visions of crawling to work through a river of treacle. Cars feel outdated to me now.

I also think that economically, London has sort of fallen into a feedback loop, where property prices and the general cost of living have risen faster than the rest of the country, so less well off people are forced out, which drives up the average wealth of Londoners, which in turn pushes up property prices and the cost of living, as sellers adjust based on the demand and the financial capacity of the average consumer/buyer. It's reaching the point now where there's such a large economic divide that those outside London feel very removed from those in London, and some harbor animosity. The whole rich/poor divide is an issue I don't have a good answer for, but I certainly see it's effects. My salary just a few years out of university is embarrassingly high compared to what people earn where I'm from (suburban north west), yet my wife and I can barely afford a 1-bed flat in London, while I have relatives who pay less in rent than we do, for a very nice 3-bed flat back home.

I wouldn't say it feels like a 'foreign' country. It just feels like London and the rest of the UK have developed at different rates, it's more like the same country, but at a different point in time. While people were talking about the economic downturn and spiraling unemployment, the job market in London was booming, especially in my field, and my employer recently increase the salaries of everyone on my team, just because the job market is so competitive down here.

I think this disparity in prosperity is also what causes politicians to seem somewhat blinkered. They see london and feel like britain is doing great, so their policies don't reflect the needs and wishes of those elsewhere.

true,Kesuke,null,null,"Most of the answers here seem to be focusing on regional politics. I don't think its really a thing. Ultimately England voted on a form of regional government and voted strongly against it. Scotland leaving isn't going to fragments rUK politics - if anything the loss of 40 odd labour seats is going to heavily unify it and the voice of Conservative England is going to get proportionately louder. I don't necessarily think a yes vote is going to be followed by the period of introspection a lot of people seem to think will happen. 

My prediction is that the the 2-5 year period during which settlement negotiations take place will probably bring about a fair deal of pain for both nations. Scots will have to reconcile the fact that the end result isn't going to be quite the fantasy the SNP portrayed, and many of those who are most vociferous in their support of independence stand to be the most disappointing. The rUK will simultaneously have to deal with the economic impact of speculation against Sterling and its businesses - all at a time when the huge economic powerhouse of England's services sector was just starting to get unleashed by improved lending conditions and the economy was improving as a result. 

In the longer term - in many respects it could be hugely beneficial for the rUK. The exodus of jobs leaving Scotland from the UK public sector or jobs that are farmed out to Scotland (i.e. most English councils seem to have call center/fulfillment operations in Scotland because its cheaper to run) being one example. It will also improve export conditions by stabilizing sterling in the long term without the effect of oil. The UK petroleum industry is likely to advance considerably with fracking which could bring about a whole new wave of economic benefits. During this stage I imagine Scotlands going through a period of political establishment where new players emerge, new parties form and different visions for an independent Scotland start to be pursued. 

The end result? I suspect a Scotland similar in prosperity and outlook to R.o.Ireland (rather than the Scandinavian fantasy world some people seem to live in), and a smaller less ambitious UK which ironically might actually look more towards the EU.",0,1410185813,null,0,false,0,ckcgfnr,t3_2fskxz,t1_ckcgfnr,t3_2fskxz,null,1427126679,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt; If Scots vote yes …

&gt; • Alex Salmond will confirm his ""Team Scotland"" of negotiators – expected to include his deputy, Nicola Sturgeon, along with senior cross-party figures – within a week or so. David Cameron, if he has ridden out calls for his resignation, will set up a similar negotiating team for the remainder of the UK.

&gt; • To minimise market instability and avoid a run on the pound, Cameron must confirm quickly the UK's stance on the status of sterling and the splitting of debt with Scotland. Other subjects for immediate discussion would include dividing up oil and gas reserves.

&gt; • All 28 EU states are expected to meet by the end of 2014 to give the European commission a mandate to investigate Scotland's EU membership. Salmond must also begin talks with Nato. Both situations are without precedent and the negotiations are likely to be complex and protracted.

&gt; • **Before the general election campaign begins in earnest, the UK parties will have to decide what role Scotland's 59 MPs at Westminster will have after May 2015. They will technically remain in the House of Commons, but only until independence day.**

&gt; • **Salmond has set midnight on 23 March [2016] as the target date to declare Scotland an independent country.** Holyrood will then be dissolved for the first elections to an independent parliament.",0,1410186736,null,0,1410187416,0,ckcgtm9,t3_2fsln4,t1_ckcgtm9,t1_ckcei9l,null,1427126498,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;__Fforest Fawr__ is the name given to an extensive upland area in the county of [Powys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powys), [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales). Formerly known as the Great Forest of Brecknock in English, it was a royal hunting area for several centuries but is now used primarily for sheep grazing, forestry, water catchment and recreation. It lies within the [Brecon Beacons National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brecon_Beacons_National_Park).

&gt;But let’s say, for the sake of argument, that the YouGov poll is not an outlier. That the “threat” of a Yes vote is real. How are our brave defenders of the Union responding to this impending catastrophe?

&gt;Like utter lunatics, is how they’re responding. Here’s a few examples. Two days ago the Telegraph reported: “Scotland will be at greater risk of terrorist attacks if it becomes an independent country, David Cameron has suggested”. This morning the Mail on Sunday has splashed on briefings from Labour that the party is considering deploying immigration officers to “secure our northern border” if the Scots vote Yes. Most of today’s papers carry anonymous quotes from Tory MPs claiming David Cameron will be forced to resign if the Yes campaign wins. Earlier in the week, Ed Miliband travelled to Scotland to explain how the Scots didn’t need to bother with independence because he’ll be prime minister in nine months time.

&gt;“Vote Yes and Jihadi John will get you”. “Vote No or the Border Force will be getting the rubber gloves out”. “Vote Yes or your beloved PM David Cameron will be forced to resign”. “Vote No because then you can be governed by Prime Minister Miliband”.

Vote Yes and you can remove David Cameron.  That's a sure fire vote winner in Scotland.",0,1410187083,null,0,false,0,ckcgyzn,t3_2ft43f,t1_ckcgyzn,t3_2ft43f,null,1427126429,97,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,97

This was all discussed YEARS ago.

They had very little other choice.

They could have not formed any coalition. Clegg would be blamed for significantly weakening the UK because we wouldn't have a proper government. A Conservative minority government would have collapsed and Clegg would get the blame. You'd also have defectors from his own party going Tory too, which would hurt the Lib Dems. It would be a disaster and the Lid Dems would be even more hated than they are now for basically fucking up the UK.

He could have formed a coalition with Labour, being more similar on ideology. But this puts Clegg into a ""kingmaker"" position and he did not have public mandate to do this. More people voted Conservative, so allying with Labour would be disgraceful. 

Or they could form coalition with the Tories. In return for allowing a coalition they could negotiate to have some of their policies included into the platform (which they did). They could even negotiate to have a referendum on some issues (like the alternate vote system which they got). They could do their best to influence the government by being part of it.

I agree that they've fucked it up, and they overstepped with promises they couldn't keep. But it's not entirely their fault. And if history could be turned back to election night and the aftermath, I don't think there is anything Clegg could have done differently.

The election manifestos are the plans and priorities a party announces *if they are elected*.  If the Lib Dems had been elected to government then those are the priorities they would have pursued.

Alas, they weren't elected - no party won the required number of votes, so leadership of the country fell to horse-trading between the various parties involved, and - *because none of the parties were cleanly elected to form a new government* - all bets were off.

Blaming a party for not upholding its election manifesto pledges (implicitly made on the condition the party was elected to government) when they're forced to form a coalition government with another party is ridiculous.  Doing so when they're a junior partner in a coalition with a much more powerful party with bugger-all interest in compromise, doubly so.

When the Lib Dems formed a government with the Tories and the Tories started riding rough-shod over the Lib Dems' ideals, the Lib Dems essentially had two options: capitulate and try to stave off the worst Tory excesses, or immediately withdraw from the coalition and risk the fall of the government on *every single issue put before them*.

Given the world was in the middle of an unprecedented financial crisis that required decisive and concerted action from the government at the time, option 2 would have been deeply irresponsible and they would have been crucified for it... not to mention the sheer presumptuousness of the minor partner in a coalition extorting and presuming to dictate terms to the major partner.

In a coalition they can't be held to promises made on the condition they were a single-party government, and as a junior partner they had one card to play - threaten to withdraw from the coalition and sink the government, requiring another general election and another government to form in the middle of the most profound financial crisis for a generation, at *exactly* the time the country neded strong, clear leadership and couldn't afford to delay or mess about with internal politicking.

Sure, the Tories managed to push through a lot of policies Lib Dem supporters (myself among them) violently disagree with, but claiming they ""should have done more"" when they had no ability short of the nuclear option - and it would have been supremely irresponsible to employ that at the time - is just unfair.

Ah.  So they shouldn't have published an election manifesto at all then?

They should instead have:

* Stared into their tea-leaves
* Magically predicted the first UK coalition government in 65 years
* *Also* predicted who that coalition would have been with (so they could have some idea whether they were then compromising with the Tories or Labour, and hence what the resulting compromise might have looked like)
* Predicted the *ultimate results* of the back-room bargaining and horse-trading between the two parties that self-evidently couldn't have been known until the actual negotiations happened...

... and then written that all down as their Election pseudo-manifesto?

You aren't sketching out a reasonable requirement here - you're demanding they exercised psychic power to predict a situation *nobody* saw realistically occurring, and then go on to foretell the precise details of the arrangement to about six decimal places.

This is not a legitimate criticism or demand.  This is nothing but emotional butthurt from someone throwing a tantrum because they got over-excited when the Lib Dems made it into government, let their expectations run wild and ignored the fact that even then as junior partner the Lib Dems were little more than a figurehead and outrage-sponge for the Tories, with no reasonable, practical way to reign them in beyond irresponsibly bringing the entire government down.

Does it suck that the Lib Dems couldn't do more to reign in the Tories?  Yes.

Basic example is always Classical vs Keynsian.


There are so many other branches of ideologies (called school of thought) that each assumes different things.


The reason why Krugman and Stiglitz's disagreement with the Scottish independence is so surprising is because they're both pioneers of the Chicago school (basically an upgraded version of New Keysians which is basically a more rigorous Keysian model), which Stiglitz more or less started and Krugman was one of his best pupils.


Maybe it's because Stiglitz is paid by the Scottish Party to work for them, or maybe they really do disagree on this issue. 


Anyway, due to the nature of economics you are always going to get conflicting ideas by different economists on the same issue. The trick is to gather as much data as you can, analyse it thoroughly and pick the route that is akin to your political ideals. It's not going to be the 100% best option for everyone, for every winner there just has to be some amount of losers in the economy and vice versa.

People bang on about the referees being great but in my opinion there are far too many matches which are ruined by a bad decision or two. Remember our game at the Etihad last season? Bit of a silly what-if, but if that game had been fairly officiated we would have won and if we had and the rest of the games were the same (they wouldn't have been), Liverpool would have won the league.

There needs to be video refereeing but not in the daft form that Blatter is proposing. Why does he want the television companies controlling it? My proposal would involve one or two trained referees operating a computer screen or two so they can quickly rewatch any incident at an appropriate angle and speed, immediately after it happens. The referee continues to do his normal job but is able to give more benefit of the doubt than we currently see, as they are supposed to. Sterling plays on, the highly-trained video ref has a quick check to see if he was offside and if he was he alerts the ref through his earpiece. If the ref misses an offside or a foul or anything like that, then it should be possible that he's alerted within seconds and can stop the play. There should be less of giving wrong stoppages by the refs because now they would genuinely only do so when they were certain, which doesn't happen currently but is absolutely supposed to happen. 

None of this shit with coaches and refs staring at a little screen and wasting time, and hopefully no delayed stoppages like in rugby and NFL.  The challenge system is a pathetic idea in my opinion, it would mean that there are guaranteed two long delays every half in almost every game and there's the simple fact that you can be wrong once and lose your challenge and then it's back to being cheated when the decision is wrong.

My dad (RIP) used to clean with high pressure steam the algae off their house every 2 years. In the UK the moss and algae seems to be never wiped.

Colors do not matter much when the sky is bright, but in a gloomy weather country they should be using more bright, light colors of houses to make things look more cheery. Dark red and brown under gloomy clouds = depression.

When I was in Oxford and on a sightseeing bus it was always like ""and in that super famous college studied such and such Nobel prize winner"" and I was like ""Withing those dirty walls covered with moss, behind that old decrepit door that is held together by paint?""

I was seriously disturbed by the lack of pride of people in the environment, in the sense of making at least those super famous Oxford colleges look classy, like everything new or at least clean.

My British coworkers explained that it is seen a virtue to not try to be too pretentious, to be modest and it is this.

Still in the longer run the lack of what Germans call anspruchsvoll mentality (it is very important in Hungary: e.g. if you run a famous, succeful college, it is sure as hell you make it look classy, new and clean and its look live up to its merits, if you are rich, you make your floors marble etc. etc.), perhaps the best English term is ""discerning"" or something like that, I ended up moving to Austria.

Edit. Your light switch analogy is a poor example to your argument. We mostly know how electrons work, we can measure current with scientific instruments. So we have a good understanding of how a circuit is supposed to work, based on scientific discovery and theories, such as Ohm's Law, Electromotive Force, Newton's Third Law (For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction) ad nauseum. So we can in fact hypothesize through scientific theory, how and why a light-switch circuit works before we even switch it on.

true,CircuitsGleam,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"The AV referendum was an absolute farce. The Lib Dems promised a referendum on a proportional voting system in their 2010 manifesto but, when they went into coalition, David Cameron would only allow a referendum on AV. Note that AV is not a proportional system; while it's arguably slightly fairer than first-past-the-post, it's much more complicated, which is a bad thing in a country where most people don't care about politics.

Anyway, Nick Clegg said yes, presumably because he was desperate to deliver *something,* and for reasons I can't recall decided to hold the vote as soon as was possible. This meant that he had no time to build up a consensus that the current system doesn't work, so there was no large movement for change as there is in Scotland now. Add to this an inept ""Yes to Fairer Votes"" campaign, Nick Clegg's unpopularity, and the fear-mongering and outright lies of the No campaign and there was absolutely no chance of change.

This was the worst possible outcome for those of us who wanted proportional voting, because it didn't give us a proper choice while also kicking the issue into the long grass for a generation. My hope now is that if Scotland votes to leave the Union it will be the shock England needs (because, let's be honest, it's the English public and politicians who are really complacent) to give us some real democratic reform, whether that be in the form of proportional voting, regional devolution, an elected House of Lords or even federalisation of the rUK.

An IFA will be able to break down what the charges of their investment proposition and their charge for running it and offer you a level of service ongoing to suit you. 

SJP funds tend to do well  in a rising market and perhaps better than their peers as they tend to have higher equity components than other funds in the same sector, but do tend to fall harder in a falling market. 

When SJP swap a manager to run the underlying mandate they just pass on the basket of shares to the new manager to trade out of it so portfolio turnover is high (and associated costs) as the new manager gets the portfolio looking how they want it.

If Scotland goes independent it looses it's banking sector and the UK looses the oil.

Thing is, the UK never really had the oil to begin with. Scottish spending per capita is equivalent to tax receipts from Scotland only with the returns from oil taken into account, so they take all the oil money as it is. The UK won't feel any poorer for them leaving due to loosing the oil tax receipts. 

The Scottish banking sector moving south of the border on the other hand will mean the rUK GDP per capita will rise, and Scotlands to fall. 

What you *could* argue, is that by voting ""yes"" Scotland will see better growth from it's remaining economies post-independence due to better government. However Scotland has/will have nearly complete control of it's economy ether way. Thus, the governance Scotland will get will be largely the same either way.

It's for this reason I hope they leave the UK.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"I work in the kitchenware industry, so have a bit of a unique perspective. Can agree that commercial quality grade tends to be low-spec but high durability. Most commercial kitchens aren't high-end restaurants. Think cheap blades and plastic handles.

Also having compared a lot of knives as part of my job, the difference TENDS to be subjective past a certain point. Very cheap stamp cut 'tesco knives' as we call them where I work (because Tesco go and tell the manufacturer, we will pay you £0.90 a knife, spec us the best knife for that price, ends up cutting back on material and so on) are noticeably bad.

Then you pay a bit more and you get your entry level knives which are actually pretty decent. So think the likes of Ikea, the stuff in TK Maxx, Debenhams, JL etc. now these are built first as knives by a number of manufacturers, who then sell rebranded versions to these retailers. They go all the way from straightforward but okay to very very decent hot-forged knives. You can get a top-spec knife for £50-£60 which would last a lifetime easily, with 25 year to lifetime guarantee included.

Then you get into speciality knife manufacturers like Henckel etc. who actually control their own supply line. They would argue that this means their knives are substantially better. They are nice knives. HOWEVER, they are not 3x - 4x better, yet they are 3x - 4x more expensive. It's basically your Apple brands of the knife &amp; cutlery industry and you tend to find the same kind of people raving about them.

My advice for buying knives: if you came into my shop I'd suggest you get a set because it's a bigger sale, and it's true that having a knife 'for the job' makes your life easier. However if you were a friend and strapped for cash I would say, budget a max of £50 a knife and find one that a) **you like** and b) is highly specified and then simply buy an 8"" chef and a 3.5"" paring, and build your knife set up over time. These two knives will do 90% of the jobs you need to do (tip: you cut on the board with the chef, and you cut in the hand with the paring) and you can always get a cheap bread knife / carving set from Ikea (still decent quality) to tide you over. I would also suggest getting a honing steel to keep the edge true.

Also personally Japanese knives are a bit of a gimmick in my view, the French or Chef Knife is superior. Buyers love them though.",0,1410193753,null,0,1410207062,0,ckck4ru,t3_2fsk43,t1_ckck4ru,t1_ckcc8d4,null,1427124953,9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,9

Maybe you haven't heard as much referendum coverage or watched the debates, but the entire argument is that a No vote is a vote to remain in the UK with more significant devolved powers. That's not only from the mouths of Scottish politicians, but plenty of Westminster ministers including David Cameron have promised the same thing (it's their campaign policy).


If it was the choice between Yes or the status quo, given the closeness of the polls it's pretty safe to say there would probably be a Yes majority.


As a Yes voter I am pretty worried about this sort of attitude though, I feel like a lot of people in the rest of the UK will feel this way after a No vote, as if the whole issue is now sorted forever and they may get very annoyed when the whole debate about what new powers there should be crops up in the news again. People attack the Yes campaign for uncertainty, but the No campaign purposely hasn't outlined what new powers Scotland should get, that's apparently to be decided after the referendum.

I beg to differ. While you lot didn't lose a match all year (which is impressive), you weren't nearly as dominate as the 04-05 Chelsea side. Set numerous records and ran away with the league. Fewest goals conceded in a season (15), most clean sheets (25), most wins in a season (29), most consecutive away wins (9), and most points in a season (95).

Hmm, interesting. Though I personally disagree with you. The basic premise of Doctor Who is that he travels *ALL* of time *and* space, right? So just because a certain location or time or character is too ridiculous doesn't mean it's not out there. It's just a matter of how the DW behind-the-scenes crew* (writers, directors) make that believable.

If you're referring to the companions, I agree. The Doctor's run with Amy and Rory was a bit overwhelming for me, but you gotta appreciate their love story. I give them that. And with Clara, you got to give her a chance this season. She bores the hell out of me on 7B, but ever since the restaurant scene in ""Deep Breath"", she keeps winning me over. She is now a character who is standing on her own and less like a plot. A schoolteacher who keeps on returning home because time-traveling is just ""one of her hobbies"", I think that's the thing you're looking for. 

&gt;Though I'm loving Capaldi.

Couldn't agree with you more on that one.

true,MrPotatoButt,pertwee,Pertwee,"No argument there.  Even though I'm really peeved at both Eccleston &amp; the Dr Who producer(s) at the time, I was really, really impressed at how Eccleston built his doctor character.  Having been a long Dr Who fan, since Pertwee, I've seen them come &amp; go, but what makes Eccleston's character construction so intriguing is that it is so starkly different from the other doctors.  

He is dressed ""conventionally"", while all the other doctors seem to have a foppish fashion sense.  He's neither professorial or histrionic (but keeps the egotism).  He behaves like an extremely direct, no nonsense, middle aged man, while the other doctors less so.

But Eccleston still seems inescapably The Doctor, because he merges those differences with a sardonic wit, a bit of impishness and silliness which doesn't look too incongruous to how he looks.  While still going into full blown Time Lord mode when something requires fixing.  He is The Doctor, while least resembling any previous or subsequent doctors.   Its really a brilliant acting job to develop a unique character in a set of expectations.  Its like doing a nonconventional version of a Shakespeare play.

But I'm really not digging this latest doctor.  I know people who didn't like Matt Smith after he succeeded David Tennant, but I had no beef with Smith.  I may end up dropping Dr Who because of this season.

Addendum:  my favorite Dr Who companion was Romana (Lalla Ward).  It would be really nice to recycle her character, and give her the lighthearted personality Capaldi appears to lack.  It would make a nice contrast, provided that the actress, writers, &amp; directors could do an above average TV production.  (The drawback is that it could seem too much like the Clara character, which many modern Whovians seem to dislike.  Add the stupid romantic fan shipping...)",0,1410196972,null,0,1410197600,0,ckclses,t3_2fsf82,t1_ckclses,t1_ckcjyn9,null,1427124180,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,seeQer11,lfc68,,"Couldn't disagree more. Tension should be built around the fluidity and action on the pitch not some stoppage video review nonsense. Football isn't tennis, nor American Football, nor rugby. What makes football the beautiful game is the constant flow of play... if we start introducing stoppages and breaks (which can be strategically abused) then you are starting the death of what makes the game great. 

As /u/MICOTINATE stated on r/soccer;

""The problem I've got with video reviews in football is two-fold

1) In every other sport they are used when there is usually a natural break in the game anyway. Tennis the challenge decides if the ball was in or out, but either way the point had ended. In football if a player goes down in the box and it isn't given what happens then? Can you stop the game for a referral? If you can that's open to abuse, if you can't the system is biased toward defenders.
Most importantly, the rules of football aren't set in stone like other sports, especially the most disputed ones. All of the rules are down to the referee's interpretation of events. It's not like a forward pass in Rugby or the ball being in or out, which are clear black and white decisions to make.

2) How many threads are there in this subreddit every weekend with hundreds of comments of people arguing about a slow-mo gif of some foul that has been given/not given? Player on player contact doesn't mean a foul, likewise contact on the ball doesn't mean no foul and fans, pundits, everyone argues about decisions because they interpret them differently.
So a manager calls for a review and the referee watches it and maybe he'll change his mind, maybe he won't, but either way the referee has to be the one to make the final decision and he'll do it with his interpretation just like he had before. Not to mention the fact that things like slow motion can be quite misleading when watching replays.


TL;DR referee interprets games and makes decisions. Letting managers make the referee second guess himself will pointlessly waste time""

##10 minute makeup.

I'm very much a, *""oh my god what time is it?""* girl, so I fully understand the make up in ten minutes or less struggle.

*Lip Colour*

If I don't have time to do anything else, I will wear a lip colour. No matter how horrible I feel, or how grotty I feel a nice lip colour always perks me up.

My favourite lip-stain is **NYC Smooch Proof**, I have two colours and it really is smooch proof. It lasts for blooming agesss on and is cheap enough that I can have multiple tubes. 

**Revlon Just Bitten Balm Stain** is really nice for when I have a bit more time. 

**Revlon Moisture Stain** I have five of these, in all sorts of colours. I'm obsessed. Superdrug &amp; Boots keep doing sales on Revlon that are too good. So I have many.

*Eye Liner*

You don't have to spend a lot of money to get a good eye liner. I really love my Lancome eye liner, but my Maybeline felt pen one does the job as well. 


##Always ask for student discount. 

Guess what? You're a student! Ask for discounts wherever you can. /u/Blue1878 is totally right, get an NUS card! There are also a lot of other companies you can sign up for, for free. UniDAYS is one. 

##SAMPLES! 

Want to try a foundation but you aren't sure you want to part with all that money? Ask for a sample pot. Like a new eye shadow, ask for a sample. The absolute worst thing they can say is no, more than likely you'll get some sample, or another product to try.

They also do make overs! So if you have something you'd like to try but aren't sure ask them to try it on for you. I wasn't sure how to do a puppy dog eye, went to the MAC counter with a picture and the lady happily talked me through how she would recreate it.

Lets take the 10 reasons provided [here](http://www.independentscotland.org/content/voting-yes-for-scottish-independence.htm) (which admittedly the first google result with a list).


1. Taking Responsibility by moving all Governing Powers to Scotland

2. Get the Government we choose

3. No more building Nuclear Weapons

4. Securing Oil Funds in North Sea

5. Scotland has the resources and finances

6. Believing in the creation of more jobs

7. Believing in the benefits for Scotland and yourself as individual

8. Believing in a more equal wages

9. Believing that Scotland and England have opposite Political and Social views

10. Understanding that NO may lead to changes for worse

I'll ignore point 10 and 8, as lets be honest its not a real point. 

1, 2, 3 and 9 are actually the same point really which is that there is an ideology gap between the English government  lead by the Tories and the more left leaning Scottish heartlands. Fair enough, and probably true but being part of a democracy means that you have to take the rough with the smooth.  I don't see this as a valid reason to leave, just like (for the large part) Wales is more left leaning than England.  Would you leave Europe because they don't have the same ideology too? At the end of the day every single democracy is a mash of differing view points. Scotland has devolved power and gets to chose its own government.

Again 4, 5, 6. Well this is the big bone of contention I suppose. I feel that the Yes campaign is putting all its eggs in one basket with the oil. Yes it brings in lots of money but relying on it is short termism, I've not see any plans to make oil for for you like Norway. What else have Scotland got? Tourism and export of whiskey I can't see many other big employers. 

8: Wages are not alone an indication of wealth, yes the average Scottish wage is a lot less than London but then where else is not really. Wages in Aberdeen are pretty high, but then so are all the costs of there. I don't have any figures but my guess is there is not a huge difference in wages.

7: I don't see a vast number of benefits and see quite a few dangers. The argument has been ill defined on both sides ",0,1410199156,null,0,false,0,ckcmwt5,t3_2fr8im,t1_ckcmwt5,t1_ckcdmpi,null,1427123658,0,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,0

Or, as in Irelands case in the play off for world cup a few years back, Henry clearly controlled the ball with his hand that led immediately to France scoring. There's so much at stake here. I think there is a way to eliminate these types of massive mistakes without ruining the flow of the game...but it's up to fifa to find out how!

true,ScribblesMcDraw,null,null,"Read what I put after ""It was necessary"" and you won't have to ask that question. Whether we agree with it or not the BBC simply would not have recommissioned a show like Doctor Who without a serious reboot, if it hadn't been the time war it would've been something else. Rebooting the series and destroying Gallifrey added a TON of mystery to the show, to the character of the Doctor and a thousand questions - many of which remain unanswered which have gained the show a lot of new viewers which is what the BBC were after. What would've been more alienating- Not recommissioning the show or recommissioning it with a bit in it that you personally don't like?

I'm sorry but there are more benefits to storytelling of the series by removing Gallifrey than just picking up the show where it left off. It would've been boring and people would've only tuned in for the nostalgia, it would've been cancelled again because new viewers wouldn't have cared and then you'd have been even more alienated.

If, instead, they pick their battles carefully, they can keep in power that much longer and hopefully tone down some of the crazier Tory ideas. But it means they have to compromise some of the things that got them votes in the first place.

Idealogically, Libdems are far closer to Labour than they are to Conservative politics. The reason they didn't form a coalition with Labour is twofold:

 - Gordon Brown has all the charisma of a wet fart.
 - A coalition of the parties that came second and third in the election - leaving the party that came first out in the cold - would have lasted about a fortnight and probably knackered both Labour and LibDems.

I'm not Scottish so I obviously don't get a vote, but generally speaking I've supported the Yes vote because I think that we've reached a point where, politically, there isn't enough common ground for this to work, and even if it was shared, the current way our system works means that Scotland has a negligible impact on Westminster overall. I think that's a mostly unavoidable democratic deficit. The only way I can see that changing is the abolition of the principle of Parliamentary Sovereignty, the establishment of a codified constitution, and full federalisation of all regions of the UK. But given that even AV or minor Lords reform was apparently too much reform, I think you'd have to be in cloud cuckoo land to think that's realistic.

And I've actually really quite enjoyed the debate over the last 12 months because I think it's got people really passionate about democracy again. I think even if there's a No vote (which I think is still more likely) we can expect increased turnout in the next election and greater participation in the future. The two sides strongly disagreed but I always felt, generally speaking, that both sides understood where the other one stood and for what reasons. While neither agreed with the other I felt that generally speaking there was a basic level of *civility* in the disagreement. ""I understand what you're saying, I don't agree with it because x, and I hope we can resolve this issue in a democratic way."" Personally I enjoyed the debates between Darling and Salmond as well.

When that poll came out, things got *really* nasty *really* quickly. Precisely as Hodge said, some of the most blatantly scare-mongering, vile suggestions were made. The implication was that we'd have a fucking Berlin Wall across the country, barbed wire fences, anal cavity searches on the border, men with guns outside shops, terrorist attacks every other weekend, etc.

So on the one hand I'm thinking ""this doesn't bode at all well for any pre-independence negotiations. How much worse are they going to be at that point?"" And on the other I'm thinking ""Jesus Christ, these are the people my country is being run by? Run, Scotland! Get out while you can!""

London is a financial and cultural capital of the world, which brings a lot of money into the country that eventually filters up north. I have clients who own business in London and outsource to companies like mine in the north because our rates are cheaper, yet we're still within commuting distance if we need to see each other for a meeting. If it weren't for London that wealth wouldn't magically appear in the country. I have no clients from Scotland.

I'd also agree that we get tourists that otherwise wouldn't have come to the country and the north if it weren't for London.

Generally London is doing very well, and I feel should think positively about that, rather than create a 'them or us' attitude. Most countries would kill for a city with as much global recognition and influence as London. I would like the capital moved to Manchester to try and balance things out and help establish a new core, but I'm not anti-London.

Attitude wise I'd consider the North more similar to London than Scotland—I just don't think we have that much in common with the Scottish, who generally seem pretty down-beat and bitter!

Almost any natural surface is better than an artificial defence in that regard, since it allows for the infiltration of more water into the soil, unlike tarmac and concrete.

Dredging rivers, building barrages, diverting channels and attempting to artificially control river basins is a futile endeavour, because there will always be a flood that you can’t plan for, and the solution that most people will demand after one of those events is to control the river even more tightly.

true,cock_blockula,null,null,"&gt; I have serious doubts about currency union without political union as the Euro has shown

Whilst all currency unions will have their downsides that doesn't make them untenable or a bad idea, besides he eurozone is in many regards a terrible comparison to a proposed sterling zone. The UK and Scotland share a lot of economic and social links, can you really say the same for the likes of Portugal, Slovenia, Cyprus and Latvia? Scotland and rUK have had a fully integrated market for 307 years, comparing that to an 18 country currency union where several members weren't even capitalist countries 25 years ago is ridiculous. There are also significant border effects between the founding eurozone states despite 15 years of the euro and Schengen being in place. Scotland would be a net exporter which would be beneficial to a sterling zone since rUK would have a trade deficit of 7%, the pound would also still be backed up by North Sea oil. 

&gt; if there is a fiscal crisis requiring the Bank of England or Treasury to pump money in then is England going to carry the burden unilaterally?

If there is a financial crisis it will be just as much in Scotland's interests to sort it out as England's hence you will see bilateral cooperation to solve problems. Many banks received help from multiple nations in the banking crisis, including RBS Group.

&gt;If no is Scotland going to say yes to any terms the Band of England deems required, I can see that going down well with Scots. 

Your right it won't, but I don't remember the bank bailouts going down well with the British public or for that matter most nations electorate. That doesn't change the fact that it was overwhelmingly in our interests to do it, and most people accept that and suck it up even if it does piss them off.

And the Scottish participating in the wars in the middle east is not remotely the same thing as the colonies fighting in the French-Indian War (which you probably know better as the 7 Years' War). As I said, Scotland is a full part of the UK. They enjoy all of the rights and privileges of being a member of the country; the colonies did not. They were a world away from the king *and* from France, and yet they had to fight a war against the French (and Indians) just because the king was doing the same. Then, when the war ended, the colonies got exorbitant taxes levied against them to help pay for the war they had no reason to participate in. We can agree that the Iraq War should never have happened, but if that's justification for Scotland leaving its union, than any blue state should leave the US, since they largely opposed the Iraq War as well.

And yeah, distance isn't a consideration - in 2014. In 1776, as I said, it took months for every single correspondence to travel from king to colony. People were being taxed in the colonies for their property by people who would never even see it, unless they spent half a year going round trip. The colonists were in a cold war with their neighbors (in Canada and Florida, for reference), all because England couldn't get along with Spain and France. The colonies had no reason to fight them - but Britain did, so the colonies had to go along with it. And again, as I said, the colonies didn't even enjoy equal status as, say, Scotland did.

Fine, the Scottish are a nation all their own. I have Scottish ancestry myself - though my ancestors lost their land by supporting Queen Mary, and left the country soon after. But it seems to me like the union between Scotland and England was mostly mutual. Unless I misread the history, it seems like Scottish lords rose to be kings of the entire British Empire from time to time.

WHAT? Are you all middle class idealists who have no fucking concept about what drugs do to people? Have YOU ever been twizzled off your barnet from a few lines, smoking a spliff thinking 'this is so nice', like you're killing the joint and it isn't even getting you stoned, it just tastes nice as the smoke passes in an out. 

And you're really energised like fuck, talking complete madness to whoever will listen to you. And you keep this up all night.. dropping pills inbetween and just fucking having a great time. 

Now, as great as you feel and as much superman as you are at that point... imagine SMACK. Heroine addicts mate just inject a drug straight into their vains and it's supposed to be THE BEST FEELING IN THE WORLD. You also chase that first hit. 

If drugs were more readily available we'd have more smack heads, who don't care about working/paying a mortgage/being productive... they just want MORE SMACK. Peoples lives fucking revolve around it... and it is not comparable to alcohol, much in the same way snorting lines and popping pills isn't, while smoking a joint like in that example I previously gave you. 

All drugs are not the same, stupid policies like this are why I'll never vote Lib Dem. They're idealists, have no concept of how this would effect people from poorer areas who already spend £200/month or more on cocaine. 

Idiots mate, I say this drinking red wine and smoking an E cigarette. But these again, are completely different drugs. You cannot logically argue that legalising smack is good for society. Then again, same for alcohol I guess. If nobody drank, imagine Friday nights eating take aways and watching TV? Or make take aways illegal because eating shit food isn't good for you either.

I picked Aston Villa mostly because I didn't want to feel like I jumped on a bandwagon. They were promising and had a good history, and I like their patch and jersey so I picked Villa and stuck with them. It has not gone well. The best players left for bigger teams and no really good players came in (the players that left sucked too). It is fun when we upset the biggest teams (last year had a lot of really fun games) but the Champions League is the most exciting to me and we have no chance of making it any time soon. I personally would choose Arsenal, Everton or Tottenham in that order but I am stuck with Aston Villa as i'm no quitter.

Now if you still want to be sold on Villa the two most exciting parts about the team right now are Christian Benteke and Brad Guzan. Benteke is amazing to watch, he is so powerful, wins most balls in the air, but near the goal he is skilled and deadly. I was ecstatic when they got him to stay last year and can't wait until he comes back. If we can somehow get him to stay for good I would be much more excited about our future. As an American it's fun to root for Guzan. He really bailed us out last year many times. I know I am biased but I thought he should have been ahead of Tim Howard in the World Cup, but I guess Timmy played pretty well there.

true,Dardanator,null,null,"I think in the immediate aftermath of independence it would be difficult for any of the other parties to become a compelling political force. That is, I couldn't see any of the parties that have campaigned endlessly for the union suddenly turning around and embracing independence. They would have two years to warm up to the idea before independence day, but I think that while negotiations are going on they would be torn between Scotland and the UK and wouldn't play a particularly big part in the negotiations.

For that reason, I think that the SNP will remain the only viable party in an independent Scotland, willing to make the best of the situation, at least for the first few years; therefore I don't think the SNP will break up following independence, though it might re-brand itself. Instead I think labour party members who support independence or at least accept that it has happened will gradually drift over to the SNP, causing labour to shrink. The two parties might even join together, as I can't see any reason for two centre-left social democratic parties existing if the issue of independence no longer separates them. Lib Dems probably will accept the result and make a go of it within a few years, tories might take up to ten years to fully embrace it (I think that's about how long it took for the welsh conservatives to outwardly support more devolution for wales, having opposed the assembly's creation initially).

The only exception to the above would be if there remains a strong pro-union sentiment in Scotland after independence, and the idea of re-joining is supported and seems possible, then there will be a case for labour remaining a strong separate party to the snp. Though the idea of rejoining sometime in the future isn't widely discussed as it would mean all the time, money and effort put into making scotland independent would have gone to waste.

How long will you be here for? Those are nice cities, but at different ends of the country. If you're only in the UK for a few days it's stupid to spend a day of it getting from one place to another
&gt;What are some of the best things to do in these cities + in other places.

Visit museums, art galleries, wander around and enjoy the architecture, go to a play or musical , or a gig or concert, or go to a restaurant - you know the stuff you do in cities.
&gt;Would it be a good idea to rent a car? 
What is the best way to get around?

A car is not a good idea unless you know you're going somewhere inaccessible by train. 

&gt;How expensive are hotels/restaurants etc? 

You can get a room in a budget hotel from around £40 if you're flexible, or something like £650 for a night at the Ritz

Restaurants  - from 99p in MacDonalds, or the tasting menu at the Fat Duck, from £220. £10 to £20 a course would be a reasonable average

Obviously not all wealthy people 'earned it' themselves, but some people work hard for what they have, while others are happy to sit back and do the minimum they can. And I don't mean jobless people, I mean people who work less hours and spend more time with the family etc. 

And of course thats their prerogative and probably a good decision in terms of health and life fulfilment.  I just don't see why someone who has worked incredibly hard for what they have should have to pay a greater % than someone who doesn't. They're paying more anyway due to earning more, having a pay another fraction on top is wrong IMO.

An example using me is I work at sea, usually 3 weeks on 3 weeks off, which is a pretty nice shift pattern to work, OK I'm away a lot, but I can enjoy my time off properly. If I work this I fall under the basic 20% tax rate, however the previous company I worked for I worked 4 weeks on 2 weeks off, so for 2/3 of the year I was away from home working. The work day we do is 12 hours, usually 6am to 6pm, often as long as 14-15 depending how the day pans out. In anyones book thats earning it, 28 days of 12 hour shifts with no days off. By doing this I go into the 40% bracket, so part of my income I have to give half to the government. 

Theres no differentiation between this and someone who earns the same money by working far less hours in a better paid job, but there are plenty of people who like to think I'm part of the privileged few for working my life away to earn a decent wage.

The Deep Breath music seems related, but I think it's more an action motif than his actual theme -- in the same way ""All the Strange, Strange Creatures"" was used during Tennant's run.

Talking about Yorkshire has a greater GDP than Wales, who the fuck cares? Even the Scots who vote yes are arguing over oil, and what benefits them as people. We need to think beyond that, and come together as the whole of the UK. Scottish people should want to put money into defending our shores, and updating trident. We face external threats as an island, and should unite against these threats, such as if the Russians decide they want a piece. 

We really should go in and invade North Korea. Let's do something which puts us right back slap bang in the middle of 'who the fuck are you', and sit around the coast of North Korea, launching constant missiles and slowly advancing, with pure dominance in the skies and eventually liberate them like the fucking nazi scum they are. 

The North Korean people will thank us for this, in the children that are there now. They could grow up knowing the UK liberated them.. and I'm not fucking joking. We shouldn't even invite America to this, as a nation, we should push fully to liberate North Korea at full war capacity. 

North Korea is such an unbelievably fucked up place. Ask the yanks to stand guard behind us in the Oceans, stationed strategically as we go in and help these peoples. 

Just like we did with the Nazi's, in time as the older generations pass and the younger more technologically savvy realise what we've given them.. they will have the freedom to websites such as this, facebook, all the good stuff we've got. They won't be eating rice with wok sauce thinking 'mmm delicious so grateful for the glorious leader who keeps us repressed and alienated from the world whilst my neighbours are shipped off to labour camps', they will think 'FUCKING KFC MATE AND A DONNA KEBAB AS I DRIVE TO WORK IN A CAR I OWN TO MY OFFICE JOB'. 

I'm not even joking about this. Crippling North Korea, wasting their glorious leader via drone strike and sending in specialist forces backed up by heavy bombardments of their shores is what we need to do. Thousands will die, and they'll die for a good cause. There is no room for rogue nations in the world of globalism that we live.

As a species, we need to move forward. We need to colonise mars and come closer together as people. Technology will enable this as it advances, but certain ideologies are extremely fucking dangerous and freedom of speech, freedom of travel (although to work can and should for us right now be limited due to inequality in living standards), and let's not ignore the fact we're human. 

As for Second leaving the UK? Where the fuck is SOME REAL LEADERSHIP IN ENGLAND? Why would Scotland even want to leave us? We need a scouse PM. 

Vote for me, united we shall stand as we invade and topple the most evil and technologically advanced civilization to date. A scouse PM would have Scotland next to us, fuck all the Southerners they need jump on board and send their kids to fight in NK with their own kids. 

LOL, a strong PM who said to NK get your fucking embassy out of our country we're going to fucking obliterate you and then acted on this would not be hard to gain public moment of at all. Just because Nazi Germany is now half way across the world and posing no threat of invasion to even SK, doesn't mean they should exist and an enslaved nation is something we should put up with.

Look, as much as we all understand that going back on a pledge they made before the 2010 election has shaken confidence in what the Lib Dems say we have to recognise it happened only once. I'm not defending them (especially as I vote for them so I was probably more disappointed than most) but it really annoys me that somehow, especially on this subreddit it's become a kind of catchphrase to moan about how the Lib Dems are unreliable, not on the issue of tuition fees, not when in coalition but on every policy and apparently on some sort of cosmic level like it's a law of the universe that the Lib Dems don't keep their promises. It just doesn't add anything to the conversation and further entrenches the main two parties who already have a stranglehold on power. People like the things the Lib Dems say - people like their stance on drugs, on surveillance and on voting reform but under every article the top comment is always some reformulation of ""I would love this but it's not like that'll ever happen lololol amirite?"". It's almost as if the Conservatives pledges about the NHS have been forgotten or Gordon Brown's moronic promise to end boom and bust economics. The main two parties have consistently broken promises every year for decades and somehow people still talk about their policies as if they still have integrity - but when the Lib Dem's say something sensible people actually like it's cut down by some silly comment about unreliability as if this is something that sets them apart.  How do people ever expect to change the parts of the established political scene they don't like if they forgive the sins of the people they hate and tear down the alternatives because they don't fit with their high standards?  

On top of that what /u/jimicus says is also correct - the Lib Dems were never in power. The Conservatives are in power and in exchange for getting through some of their policies, particularly those economic policies which required immediate action in 2010 and would otherwise have stalled in the commons as Labour held it up, they have enacted some Lib Dem policies.

I think the battle between the right and left, classically at least, surrounds the role Gov should play in the economy. On paper, Labour are for activist government, and Tories for letting the free market take the lead.

I understand corruption, sleaze, etc get in the way on both sides, but lets stick to theory for now.

Labour were in favour of setting up regional assemblies, assuming that installing yet another layer of bureaucracy in a region is the key to economic rejuvenation and prosperity. The coalition is in favour of investing heavily into Northern cities, and from what I personally understand, if the Conservatives win the next election outright, the steps will go further and more towards the type of deregulation which made Hong Kong and more locally, Canary Wharf, finance hubs. 

Obviously, I don't mean for finance, but I have heard that technology is in focus. For example, Manchester has had 25 Nobel Prize winners, but no real technology sector. Its crazy. 

I hold the view that if Tories win the next election, free market solutions will be used to liberate key regions in the UK from economic dependance on the South East/London/Westminster. I have a strong hunch that they are being held back from doing so at present, and restricted to investment projects. (State v Market). I think it will work too.

Maybe both parties have good intentions, but where one offers red tape, the other offers market solutions. 

I think there is a lot of clamour for change in England which may seem surprising, and I don't think there is any resentment to Scotland either. The situation is stagnant and needs a shake up.

I just think that after 10+ years of Labour, and a golden hand cuff coalition with Lib Dems, Scotland could be leaving at a key point where the UK gets regional economic liberation which will ultimately trump anything that can largely be achieved by more government.",0,1410211250,null,0,false,0,ckctmf9,t3_2ft43f,t1_ckctmf9,t1_ckcqo69,null,1427120410,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Why is this important? Well, most financial products are similar and fund performance tends to average out over time. Picking the right investment however means that the adviser will have taken account of:

- The tax position of the client
- The tax treatment of the investment wrapper (e.g. investment bond, unit trust, EIS, etc.)
- The tax treatment of the underlying investments within the wrapper (e.g. equities, corporate bonds, cash, etc.)
- The purpose of the investment, in terms of income, growth, timescales, etc.
- The holistic impact of the recommendation in terms of other issues, such as Inheritance Tax, impact on social benefits, ethical issues, anything else specified by the client as important, etc.

To take a simple example, the BBC cover Scotland as part of the UK. You might not be entirely happy with the coverage, neither are most of us who live outside London.

Solve a considerable amount of the deficit problem, and gain respect from other Western nations while you're at it.
* Transparency. There needs to be a far more open culture in government if there's ever going to be a restoration of trust.
* Stricter regulations/contracts for outsourcing. There seems to be an increasing amount of failure in privatised agencies, and punishments are fairly light. Any infringement of the contract should result in serious fines and a ban from providing public services, depending on the extent of the failure.
* Not-for-profit state competitors in utilities. People would have to pay less, yet there would still be pressure on the government to maintain high standards lest people return to private alternatives. This will also save on all of the money lost during a nationalisation programme.
* State investment in green power energy, particularly innovation and design: give tax cuts (or tax-exempt status) to those companies dedicated to producing more efficient renewable power sources that can be used in the UK.
* Build more government owned housing, of all shapes, sizes and qualities. Make them rent-only, and undercut the current rental market, as well as increasing supply generally to reduce rents.
* Reduce numbers of exams for students, potentially removing formal GCSEs altogether. End the free school system, and potentially academies too to increase the amount of oversight. Redistribute school funds gained according to needs.
* Abolish the House of Lords, and replace it with a PR, party list system, either to be held simultaneously or in between general elections. Give the new body much more power to restrict the Commons, thus hopefully getting much more representative governance.
* Somehow, break up the Murdoch empire, and legislate a limit to the number of media outlets/viewing and reading figures a single organisation can own.

I don't have worries about the F35B.  It might be a little wonky to begin with, but almost every carrier aircraft has been in the past.  Then they're sorted out completely and are pretty dangerous.  The F4 is a good example.  

The big issue of not having a catapult is that it means we definitely can't use the E2 Hawkeye.  There's no point buying stealth aircraft without backing radar - if a stealth plane switches its own (much less effective) radar, it's no longer stealthy at all.  Radars on fighter planes are more like waving a torch around in the dark than the big 360 degree scanning things on ships (or E2s and E3 AWACS planes).  

It's a very, very big hole in the carriers' capabilities which *must* be sorted out, else all the F35s will be good for is fighting aircraft within the radar range of the Type 45s.... much too late to stop an attacking aircraft from launching a cruise missile.

If anything, he left too early. Neither Arsenal were prepared to lose him, nor Barca to take him. It really was a pointless, and in hindsight quite damaging transfer for them. Wenger actually advised Cesc to leave at 25-26 when he's fully ready, but obviously he didn't listen. Look how that turned out for everyone.

&gt; That is why when players say they want to go at Chelsea we let them and usually get plenty of money from our investment. The price of the player is the club's choice.

The easiest solution for France is simply to ignore them and hope they don't stay in France too long. It costs France the least, it doesn't bring up human rights issues, or anything like that.

a.  Your parents transfer their equity to you.  £180k.

There're almost certainly going to be practical difficulties for your parents in gifting the equity value.  In the simplest possible terms the bank isn't going to like it.  Since they hold a lien over the property they're not likely to cooperate.

Over and above this the last round of making mortgages less risky added a requirement for the mortgage lender to consider affordability.  I would guess there is no way they're going to offer a mortgage of some 6 1/2 times your pre-tax annual income.  Even if they didn't object to that, at the current dirt low 1.75% interest rate your repayments would be about £750 a month.  They're almost certainly going to consider that more than you can afford.  *(I appreciate that you probably have in mind that your parents continue to pay the mortgage, but that's not how affordability would be tested.)*

This was initially due to growing up under Thatcher, but then after a false dawn (one Labour vote in 97) from seeing how both main parties behave in Westminster.

We saw what happened in 79 (when I was seven), and we fixed in 97. Since then, many folk up here have worked within the democratic framework to campaign for a vote on independence. We got this in 2011 when, again within the democratic framework of the Scottish Parliament, the SNP achieved a majority many thought impossible.

We might get a yes, we might not. On the back of a no we will probably get a lot more devolved power (although 79 is a bad precedent, I think the electorate is so much more empowered now that it will not happen again).

However, all of the above change has come about because people from Scotland pushed for it, campaigned for it, convinced their fellow Scots to vote for it. It took a long time, but here we are, eight days from a referendum, and sitting at what looks like 50/50.

Anyone from England reading this - you can do the same. It will be harder no doubt, as you are bigger and the vested interests are so much richer and more powerful than up here. But it can be done.

Embrace the change happening in Scotland. It is not against you, and it is not threatening to you. You're a fucking great country, and the shysters in Westminster are screwing us all.

Then he left and we were flirting with relegation again. 


There have been so many ups and downs just in the last 8-9 years and it's fun to watch the club evolve. While we may not be as entertaining as Arsenal or Everton or even Swansea, there is alot of passion for the club and they will put in supurb performances from time to time. Last season we took alot of points from the bigger clubs and let me tell you, watching Villa beat Arsenal, Chelsea and Man City last year was fucking awesome and totally satisfying. I think this year we will be even better than last year and surprise alot of people. Plus Benteke is coming back soon and he is a beast.

true,janekpol,null,null,"Hi My story
27 years in Poland, then 4 years in UK, back to Poland for 6 years, now back to UK for good (can't stand the Poland any more).
UK vs Poland:

//////////////////TRAFFIC:
UK: Politnes, courtesy and hight culture on roads, very easy round abouts, very few road signs, no patrols, no portable speed camera in very tricky places LOVE IT
POLAND: Mad drivers, crazy cross roads never sure who go first, multitude of rads signs often one against other, still lot of holes on roads so stay focus not only on road signs as well on the wholes to not lose the wheel. HATE IT 

////////////////BANKS:
UK: needed 3 months statment at Barclays, no way to do online, had to go to branch and only manager was able to do it.
Poland: mbank can do online statement even 10 years back

//////////////////FOOD:
UK:didn't like at begining it just becouse of bad chef all was mushy and no fresh salads only boiled veges, at the place used to work now after years it is quite good (eg Toby Carvery), in uk people don't like raw veges salads
Poland: Still in love with kotlet shabowy, ziemnieki z koperkiem and fresh salads

///////////////WORK RELATIONS:
UK: Bosess very good apreciate each small things, very thankfull, you can feel you are needed in your work. LOVE IT
Poland: Bosses very rude, often threaten to emploees, cheating on everything holiday, salaries, wants you to stay and do overtimes for free, act like little hitlers.  HATE IT

//////////////PEOPLE RELATIONS:
UK: People and life tend to be normal here, they work, getting paid on time, love spend money on plesure and shopping. If hou have amitious or work hard you can be second bill gates, or you can do care job all life and without worring being sacked. Friday no one does overtime people enjoing life in pubs 
Poland: constant rat race starting from preschool, school, work and life, people keep denunciating to each other at work place, liking bosess ass, doing overtimes, Warsaw Friday evening 20:00 oficess packed with robots doing overtimes for penuts. Lots of frustrated psychpatics

//////////////PEOPLE Attitudes
UK: Happy, laid back, not worried, warm to strangers however even if don't like you will never tell you - only behind your back :(
POLAND: very sad, very unpolite and stressed people, very uncertain upon life, job and lack of money and prospect for future.Once accepted someone they are become real friend. If somone don't like you you will know that very soon.

/////////////////////HYGENE
UK:Generally people don't care much about hygene at own homes, council houses, restaurant even hospitals (Carpet floors)
Poland:People especialy women are obsessed with hygene and tidyness, house must be cleaned on regular basis, no carpet floors only laminates or tiles

/////////////////////BUILDERS TRADESMANS
UK:When doing DIY polish people don't trust local. Often each kind of job plumbing, plastering, piping require different tradesman which is hard to trust.
Room was flooded regullary from neighbour lot of mold build up on furniture and wall, guy came to fix it with can of paint and paint brush

Poland:usually one guy does all job, so if you find right one no worries.

//////////////////////DOCTORS
UK: sometimes maybe not so highly educated but very friendly and open to you, try to help and treat you nice like a pal

Poland: often good specialist, but treat you like a rag, very presumptous and unfriendly

///////////////////////CLERKS 
UK: very friendly, patients and helpful even for those nuisances with bad english
Poland: very rude, presumptous, unhelpful, treat you like potential theft or con man

///////////////////////BUSINES AND LAW
UK: very easy to open and run company, very easy accountancy system, very low NI contribution rates.
Poland: you have to be Einstain or rocket scientist to understand polish law, tax VAT,  and NI law, very high NI contribution rates which kill every business you try to open.

//////////////////////POLITICIAN
UK: some of them very good, some of them less
Poland: all of them are bloody thefts should be locked long time ago


////////////////////CARPETS
Uk: why people in UK love so much carpets? it is hard to clean, and there are milions mites inside cause health and alergy problems

For me advantages are still higher in UK than Poland hope national party won't be sending back when come to power

**Tre'r Ceiri** (*Town of the Giants*) on the Llŷn Peninsula, in Gwynedd, NW Wales, is an spectacular and fantastically well-preserved Iron Age hillfort with commanding views over the peninsula that really should get more attention than it does. It's located on a subsidiary summit of Yr Eifl (*The Trident*), a mountain on the north coast, so it requires a bit of a hike to reach. Unusually for hillforts, there is more than just earthworks left to see - hut circles can still be picked out between the vegetation, and an imposing encircling wall - which still reaches 4 m in places - surrounds the site. The whole place was built in the same way as the dry stone walls which criss-cross most of rural Wales. On a clear day you'll be rewarded for your efforts with fantastic views over the peninsula, Snowdonia, Anglesey and Cardigan Bay. 

**Bryn Celli Ddu** (*Mound in the Black Grove*) and **Barclodiad y Gawres** (*Apronful of the Giantess*) are neolithic passage tombs on the Isle of Anglesey in NW Wales. They are fantastically well preserved and really worth a look. Barclodiad y Gawres is right on the coast, so I assume the coast path runs right past it. 

**Aber Falls** near Bangor, again in NW Wales (and I'm not even from that part of the country!) is an impressive waterfall in a secluded valley in the Carneddau mountain range, not far from the eponymous village of Abergwyngregyn on the coast. It's a short, relaxing walk up to the falls themselves.

The commanding moral authority of the Founding Fathers of European integration – Schumann, Adenauer, de Gaspari and Jean Monnet himself – was a result of their rootedness  in the Christian ethic of forgiveness coupled with an enlightened political wisdom which understood that it is better to look forward to a future of reconciliation and integration rather than wallow in past historical rights and identity

&gt;If anything, he left too early. Neither Arsenal were prepared to lose him, nor Barca to take him. It really was a pointless, and in hindsight quite damaging transfer for them.

&gt;&gt;Hanging on to long was in reference to how long they dragged on the transfer. If a player wants to go you shop them around immediately. Driving up the price. Instead they waited.

At Arsenal: 303 appearances, 57 goals, 98 assists. Won: FA Cup, FA community shield. I think he was more successful at Barcelona. He wasnt too young when he left. He just didn't enjoy La Liga as much as he thought he would. He was a huge asset.

I'd say its easy (and best) to start with my favorite (old) doctor, #3, Jon Pertwee.  Many episodes of Doctors #1 and #2 were lost.  The first one was doddering, and the second was cranky and annoyingly clownlike.  I don't see myself missing either.  I don't think Pertwee's run has any lost episodes.  I'm not quite as sure about Tom Baker's (the iconic #4, he had so many seasons).  The fifth was okay (Peter Davidson).  I loathed Colin Baker's (#6), even though I don't hold him completely at fault for it.  He was just annoying as hell in his rendition of The Doctor, and his companions were about as annoying.  #7 was Sylvester McCoy (My big void, though I don't think modern episodes ever recycle trivia or plotlines from it).  #8 was only a TV movie, and I never understood why they even count him (rather than determine he wasn't ""canon"").  The 9th regeneration, which no one counts him as such, is the John Hurt (modern) episode.  The #9 doctor is considered Chris Eccleston, and he's an odd taste for some.  etc. etc.


I really don't have the time to watch them again, but I'd like to see the Romana I episodes (I think it was only a few episodes, don't really recall her), or the Romana II regeneration.

true,Frankeh,eng-eastsusex,South East,"You cant compare submarines to aircraft carriers. They have vastly different roles.. 

First off, submarines operate alone and underwater for long amounts of time. On top of that, they also have to be as silent as possible due to the nature of their missions. Stealth. 

Give those two factors, nuclear makes perfect sense. 

Carriers on the other hand always set sail in convoy. They can't go anywhere on their own as they'd be huge sitting ducks.. At the very least they want an attack sub and a Type 45 with them at all times. One acting as ship/submarine defence and the other as air defence. 

So the carrier group is as mobile as its weakest link, which would be the type 45. The type 45 has a range of 7,000 nautical miles. The carriers outperform them by 3,000 miles. 

So unless we have an entire nuclear fleet, nuclear is mostly pointless. You're going to need to refuel your non nuclear ships anyway, so you might as well just go for diesel everything.  

It makes sense for the yanks because they have the economy of scale thing going for them. They have 11 aircraft carriers.

While I do have my reservations about some aspects of Moffat's work, I enjoy much of the things he does and have a lot of respect for him.  When I said I didn't think that he could tackle this story, it was not an anti-Moffat statement, as I would have made the same comment during the Russell T. Davies era as well. Moffat is the current show runner is all, and I meant no more than that.

As far as WHY I don't think he could tackle it: It's just a tough aesthetic combination.  I made the illustration after a midnight showing of Herzog's Nosferatu, which has a very specific aesthetic that would be tough to reconcile with the aesthetics of Doctor Who.  Could ANY show-runner combine Herzog with the Doctor?  The nice thing about art is I don't have to answer that question over the course of 45 minutes and make it work for an audience that has expectations.  I liked the image in my mind, I made the art, and I leave it up to everyone to picture in their heads how it would play out based on what aesthetics appeal to them.  Some people would enjoy a silly romp with the Doctor antagonizing a vampire, and some (like me) would enjoy a very dark episode that explores two of the most desolate beings in te universe.  Two lives with tragedy, both with their respective painful pasts, both misunderstood.  Who knows?  It would be tough to make that episode that pleases everyone.

The fucking truth is, the funding is going nowhere, if anything, maybe now we wont have blue skies research funding siphoned off in to buzzword ridden ""immediate economic return areas"" like ""big data.""  In fact, as someone who is in academia in Scotland, I am quite frankly fucking appalled and offended that little Englanders such as yourself actually believe that our institutions are only funded because of their geographical location, and not the quality of the research being done.  Scotland has the highest number of top universities per head in the world.

My group alone works as part of a collaboration with universities in over a few dozen countries.

It would most likely be peaceful.

&gt;What happens to the Royal estates in Scotland? (if any)

Private property would still belong to the owners.

As for the Crown Estate, see http://scotreferendum.com/questions/what-will-happen-to-the-crown-estate-in-an-independent-scotland/

&gt;Will they keep their current laws or draft an entirely new constitution?

Probably keep what they have. Scotland has had devolved legislature for quite some time already.

&gt;If I'm not mistaken, Scotland is in a union with England and Wales, forming Great Britain, if Scotland does indeed gain independence they leave the union, right?

Great Britain is the name of the island. Scotland would be leaving the United Kingdom unless someone decides to dig a giant ditch across the border. ;)

&gt;will they become a member of the Commonwealth like Canada and Australia?

Maybe. http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-23762792

You think you are right 100% and no one can dissuade you even a bit.  It's not worth the mental effort to try to point out that players can be at the same skill level while having different results due to the players around them being at different skill levels.  You only care about hard numbers and do not seem to be able to capture nuance.  

Numbers are reference points to a player's skill, not the be all end all.  Trophies are great, but tell you little about a particular player's skill.

Cardboard cut-out characters set on modern day earth, really make for a boring performance. To me a character is really reflected in their environment, e.g. Rose lived in a cheep apartment in a community building with her mother, had a dead end job at a modern London department store, and had an equally dead end boyfriend who was a mechanic. These environmental factors justified her character and gave it a sort of depth.

Jump ahead to Moffat's run and that justification is gone. e.g. The Ponds , they were just there. And I know this can all be explained away by the cracks swallowing everything up in Amy's life but even after the Doctor rebooted the Universe, we didn't see any of the Ponds normal lives apart from that one-off ""The Power of Three"" which in itself only really revealed that Rory works at a hospital and Amy writes travel articles.

Scotland.
Pros.

* A complete new start for a country, being able to try new ideas with almost complete freedom.
* More agile, being able to to adapt quicker to social and economic issues due to less red tape from London.
* A chance for the people of Scotland to have their say on things that may only effect them and control them aswell.
   


Cons.

* Uncertainty, no guarantees, no going back
* going from competing with France and Germany to Ireland and Sweden for economic growth.  Both of whom already have long standing trading partnerships.
    


England
Pros.

* Can focus on infrastructure for the remaining part of the UK, greatly reducing cost.

Cons.

As I can see it for England life will continue as normal, we have nothing to lose except population.  There's no vast mining/farming/finance sector in Scotland that we will suffer for if we lose it.  Yes there is north sea oil but that in itself in not large.
    
        

It really is all on Scotland and if they choose to go alone it is more likely than not they will do well, especially if they get quick acceptance into the EU as an independent nation and short term the north sea will keep them going at their current level.

You'd need to ask a mortgage advisor.  From the mortgage lender's point of view it would be extremely low risk just by virtue of the amount of equity.  

That said, under the money laundering rules you have to be able to account for the source of a deposit.  If that's coming from your parents you might be better having them pay off a chunk of the mortgage.

The biggest issue is likely to be the issue of affordability.  You'd have to convince the bank that you can afford to make the repayments on your own.  Given that interest rates can't stay as low as they are forever, they're likely to want you to make a case for being able to pay if they rise by a few percent.

&gt;Would there be any issues outside of inheritance tax in the selling the house to me for only the value of the mortgage.

Other than a transfer of ownership between spouses the disposal of the property would probably be liable to capital gains tax.  Assuming this is your parents' home they'd probably qualify for relief from CGT.  *(Private residence relief.)*  If it isn't, they might be liable to CGT at 18%.

CGT calculation would be more or less:    
Split 50:50 between your parents:-
Disposal proceeds.    
Less Original cost.    
Less cost of any improvements.    
Less incidental disposal costs.    
Less tax free amount (About £10,000 each.)    
=Taxable gain.    
CGT = Taxable gain x 18%

There will also be Stamp Duty Land Tax due on the transaction which would be about £10,500 on a £350,000 property.

4 &amp; 5. Yup, Scotland leaves the United Kingdom (and the Queen regains her separate status as Queen of Scotland, according to the proposals, IIRC?).

As for whether it becomes a member of the Commonwealth, the EEA, EU, this is where ""nobody knows!"" is the most honest answer.

The EU has never established how to deal with such a secession - imagine the difficulties with Basques, Catalans, Lega Nord, etc. all getting involved - and so neither side can claim with any certainty what will happen.

Indeed, to talk of 'sides' is wrong, because even within the British Isles there's agreements about freedom of movement between the UK and Ireland which predate EU membership (the Common Travel Area, also covering the non-EU Channel Islands and Isle of Man). This, I'm guessing, never dealt with secession, either.

In the unlikely event of a Yes vote, I can envisage Scotland negotiating a unique position as a new member of the Common Travel Area, thus exempting it from the 'new EU member' requirements of the Schengen treaty, due to the incompatibility of the two.

In which case I'd say compare him to keepers in teams which play a similar way to the way we do.

That would include, with certainty, Szczesny at Arsenal and Neuer at Bayern.

Both goalkeepers had higher saves per goal ratios than Joe, Neuer significantly so, almost double in fact, and Bayern play a notoriously high line.

Debatable comparisons re a similar approach with a high line, could include Lloris at Spurs, Mignolet at Liverpool, and Howard at Everton.

More often than not, the teams these goalkeepers play for use a high line with pressing high up the pitch, just like we do, but they sometimes switch it up depending on who they play.

All had higher saves to goals ratios than Joe.

In fact, all 11 goalkeepers listed had a higher saves to goals ratio.

Southampton were renowned for playing with a high line, and pressing high up the pitch last season. They were widely praised for it. They had a fairly average goalkeeper at the time, Artur Boruc, here's how he measures against Joe:

http://imgur.com/TD4QKtw

He too has a higher saves per goal ratio than Joe, among others.

Joe's saves per goal ratio was even lower in the 2012/13 season, at just 1.41 - and that was during Mancini's tenure, when we played much deeper without the stark high line.

A center-right Liberal party, a center left Social Democratic party, a right UKIP/Conservative party and a left Green/Labour party.

Another reason for not forming a coalition with Labour was that Labour weren't actually open to it while the Tories were serious about it. And given that the LD's had been talking about coalition government being viable and desirable since the SDP–Liberal Alliance was a thing, they would instantly open themselves up to ridicule if they didn't form a coalition with the party that a) had the most votes and b) were open to forming a coalition.",0,1410227920,null,0,1410228212,0,ckd211n,t3_2fsmry,t1_ckd211n,t1_ckco0mn,null,1427116391,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Bertie and Haughy are a pity, yes. Both left the country in a better state than they found it, although Ahern very nearly didn't. Some of Ireland's recent politicians have left it down, you're correct. Mostly that's a product of our two largest political parties being based on, rather than real policies, the independence treaty resulting from the state you left us in.

At the same time, that some individual cronyism and some pockets being lined are notable for a less than a century old country whose economy was almost entirely agrarian two generations ago is probably a good thing overall.

I think you're being pretty unfair, to be honest.

Bertie... Yep, a pity about him. The opposite of Enda, all the charm he could have, and managed to very nearly sink the place financially. However he did preside over there actually being anything to actually sink, brought the odd confidence that we'd never had before, and had a substantial bearing on the peace process up North. Which is why I've said earlier that he left the place in better shape than he found it. Again, the recklessness with financial regulation did mean that he very ensure didn't so he's forever tainted by that. In the long run that's what people will criticise, not his participation in petty corruption. He's no Berlusconi, that's for sure.

You might think the minimum wage is a way of paying some sort of dignity premium -- hence language like ""living wage."" People with such good intentions look at the direct beneficiaries of these policies, say, burger flippers now making $7.50 an hour. They pat themselves on the back. But they rarely count the invisible costs: willing human beings who never get hired in the first place.

&gt; But $5.00 an hour is not enough to live on!, they'll say. For whom? A teenager living at home with his parents? An elderly person who wants simply to stay active? A single mom with three kids? A single woman sharing an apartment with 2 roommates? Of course, not all of these people could live off of $5 an hour. But some of them could given the opportunity. Concerns about those who couldn't don't justify minimum wages even if we ignored the invisible costs of the policy, which include reduced margins to businesses that might otherwise grow (and hire more people).

Dier- Fazio- Vertonghen- Rose
----Capoue----Dembele
Lamela--Paulinho---Eriksen

I honestly think Paulinho's future, or at least his place this year, is at the advanced playmaker role. Lamela and Eriksen can move all around freely still and paulinho is athletic enough to do the same. I just think that when attacking through the middle, lamela and eriksen both come from their respective sides most of the time anyways so it wouldn't hurt to 'start' them out there. 

I put dembele next to capoue because I still believe he is the most talented midfielder we have, plus his strength on the ball next to the sturdy capoue has the potential to have similar effects to the best partnership a couple years back of him and sandro. 

I put Fazio in there simply because Dier is pushed out right, Kaboul is not good enough and a Vert/Vlad partnership I do not think is ideal right now. That is also why I chose Rose, because with Dier at RB, we would need his speed on the opposite flank.

I think Lloris is obvious and Soldadp deserves a shot, especially with an attacking three behind him who are prone to playing the ball to his feet. Plus in this set up Paulinho can help him hold the ball up.",0,1410231774,null,0,false,0,ckd3yfh,t3_2fv7gx,t1_ckd3yfh,t3_2fv7gx,null,1427115492,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

I don't think Holtby ever really was a first choice XI player for us (even though he never got a fair chance at playing there), but he's definitely a handy option to have coming off the bench.  His energy is unquestionable, and to be able to bring him on in the 70th min to run other teams ragged or at least create movement high up the pitch would've been helpful.

The problem that I see it is that Poch hasn't had to manage Europe along with league commitments, and obviously Holtby wanted to be playing.  So he pushed for a loan/move, and Poch may have underestimated how many players he needs for a long season.  If Eriksen and/or Lamela get injured for a long-ish time at any point (god forbid, but let's not forget Lamela's horrorshow of injury just last season), then we're somewhat screwed.  We're now putting all of the creative attacking onus on two players who are young and still only in their second year in the EPL (practically Lamela's first really).  I don't think that's wise.

The shame is I reckon had Holtby stayed around, he would have seen plenty of game time across Europa and the league across the length of the season.  Worst case scenario for us, there's no harm in at least keeping him around.

Whereas with last week it was trying to be all brooding and serious and **A Dark Doctor episode** in spite of all the dumb shit swirling around in the narrative.

That's why I enjoyed this week. I really didn't think they tried to pile in too much, there was a lot in here but I would definitely say that they did a fantastic job of fleshing it all out adequately, setting up stuff early on and having it pay off as the episode went on, without detracting from any of the fun or cool character stuff. 

It actually really felt like an old who episode to me, partly because of the setting (The Time Warrior anyone?), partly the tone and story (City of Death anyone?), but also because there was so much stuff crammed into it that was threaded through the episode and bouncing around different characters plots. This could have definitely made a great two parter but as it is I still think it was fantastically well paced without sacrificing anything in the way of substance.

Or better, what about the costs inherent in putting somebody caught with an illegal substance through the criminal process, and then for imprisoning them? Remember, criminal processing, courts, and prison all cost money. Why not instead simply confiscate the substance without criminal charges, or treat it as a much lesser charge, and instead plough the money that would have been spent on all of that into improving treatment for addicts? It also means police can officially start focusing on dealers instead of worrying about users: Something that most police officers generally do already, because even they realise that turning an addict into a criminal isn't going to stop the problem, and is a waste of time when they could be focusing on more serious criminals.

And remember, not every drug user is an addict; not every person who takes drugs for recreation needs to go through a recovery program, but effective options should definitely be funded and made available to anybody who wants it without fear of legal repercussions or public shaming, and possibly before they ever require emergency care.

What do you think is cheaper for the taxpayer? Paying to run an addiction centre offering treatment, or using police resources to catch and apprehend them, throw them into the courts system, where they pay multiple people to handle, process, and judge them, then transport them to a secure facility patrolled 24 hours a day by guards, paying for all their meals, lodging, and medical costs, where they get introduced to the more serious elements of the criminal world?",0,1410234507,null,0,false,0,ckd581n,t3_2fsmry,t1_ckd581n,t1_ckcdx0q,null,1427114901,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'd rather not get into that but yeah I really don't think that that's a good example to put with Midnight, Blink, and the Silence. 

And I thought the stuff with Robin and the Doctor was incredibly insightful in regards to both their characters, I mean, you try being the stuff of legends and not ending up as odd and ridiculous as they both are. You're offended by having themes and points shoved in your face but you missed the whole point of their squabbling. Reminded me of the first, second, and third doctors relationship with one another on the few occasions they got together, which makes total sense because as is a main theme in the episode Robin and the Doctor are sort of equivalents, hence why they butt heads so much. 

And on your point regarding how they're writing Capaldi's Doctor, I'd like to quote the fourth Doctor himself:

[""There's no point in being grown up if you can't be childish sometimes""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRDPb3P0Qw0). 

Big part of the character is that he never lets go of childish wonder and silliness, and that's something I enjoy about the show too.

Conversely, Christians actually commit a disproportionately low amount of crime. So while there will of course be outline cases such as this one, when people say they are concerned about Muslims committing crime, they have good evidence based reasons to be. 

Some facts for you to think about:

Muslims represent only 4.7 per cent of the population in England and Wales, according to the most recent Census, yet one in seven prisoners (14 per cent) in England and Wales is a Muslim. Across England and Wales the proportion has risen from eight per cent a decade ago to 14 per cent now.

The rate of increase of Muslim inmates in British prisons is [eight times faster](http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/3913/uk-muslim-prison-population)	 than that of the overall prison population, and the numbers show a clear over representation of Muslim convicts.

Hope what I've said hasn't soured this good news for you though.

The Russian still operate a fleet of nuclear powered ice breaker / resupply vessels. 

It quickly turned out that actually operating reactors on ships is far more expensive than conventional propulsion. One reason is that refuelling reactors on ships requires the entire ship to be cut open, but the biggest cost factor in a nuclear reactor for marine applications is always the crew to operate and maintain it at sea. Im guessing here, but if a Nimitz class carrier requires at least 40 - 50 nuclear engineers (20-25 per reactor) on board to operate the reactors 24/7, it may need another 100-200 engineers on land to ensure the ship can be crewed 365 days/year. And a training program to ensure at least 40 or so engineers come on line each year to make up for those that leave. Thats roughly 300 engineers costing about 100k - 200k$ (at the very low end) in salaries, supplies and upkeep per person, per year, just to ensure one carrier can operate. In total $30mn-$50mn just for crew, per year, regardless of how far it will travel. 

A conventional diesel turbine requires just a hand full of much less trained mechanics, and can be refulled without cutting it open. That is why they are not used in commercial container ships.

They are still viable in the military application because of the non-monetary benefits, reducing the supply ""tail"" that follows a carrier group, freeing up space normally used for marine diesel, and increasing the time on station still outweigh the cost, at least for the US Navy.",0,1410238640,null,0,1410238975,0,ckd6w9o,t3_2ftdyb,t1_ckd6w9o,t1_ckczih6,null,1427114091,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,RedditMcRedditor,nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"£9 an hour would be slightly better. 

This would put people just over the edge of claiming working tax credit when doing just over 30 hours per week. 

Around 60% of the country are claiming some sort of benefit, with a large amount of those being people in work but on a low wage. Working tax credit, housing benefit, and council tax benefit are topping up their income because they don't earn enough money via work. 

£9 an hour would give a lot of people a liveable wage and reduce the benefits bill far more than the current method of badgering the unemployed.

He told them who was going to be a part of his plans and asked others if they were willing to play for the team and not just themselves. Because of this I trust Bony is okay being here to help be a part of moving Swansea forward. Going off of what others have said, he has played very well so far and had a fantastic season with us last year. So I don't see why there would be any indication of a problem or ""rift"" between Bony and the rest of the squad. If there was Monk wouldnt be having it.
