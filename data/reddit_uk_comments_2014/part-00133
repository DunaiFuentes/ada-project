&gt; In the twentieth century both fairs suffered a slow decline, but one-off events were often held on Midsummer Common throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In 1974 a band of Cambridge University students, calling themselves the Mayday Group, decided to hold such an event after gaining publicity in the General Election of February that year, in which they fielded a candidate. 

&gt;So on Mayday bank holiday a stage was erected at the east end of the common, Arjuna Wholefoods set up a stall, and a one day alternative fair was held. It was such a success that the organisers decided to do it again a few weeks later in June, as an alternative to the Cambridge University May Balls (which, confusingly, are held in mid to late June). 

&gt;They branded this second event 'Strawberry Fair' and, apart from the single stage, it featured clowns, comedy and surrealism, in keeping with the Monty Python age.

true,JackXDark,null,null,"&gt; you think we should boycott anyone who casually uses the word nigger 

Right. 

&gt; your defence of Elvis Costello using it is fucking hypocritical.

Except that Costello's use of the word is exactly the opposite of causal. It's extremely pointed and accusatory.

&gt; So you clearly think the word nigger is so inherently bad that if anyone uses it outside of a serious, ethical, political or news-worthy discussion we should boycott them.

Yup.

And that's what he's doing. He's attacking the people who would use that term casually, and his song *is* political discussion.

&gt; Firstly.. when is 'nigger' not about black people? Kind of core to the concept.

Okay, that is a good point, but there is also a history of the use of the word with other modifiers to dehumanise racial groups that aren't black. 'Sand nigger' for Middle Eastern people and muslims in general that seems to have been used a lot in recent years for obvious reasons. 'Timber nigger' or 'Prairie nigger' for Native Americans. 'Ice nigger' for Canadians and Alaskans. There are probably more, but none of them are especially new. They're all using 'nigger' as causal, dehumanising shorthand for someone considered contemptuous. 

&gt;Your position seems to be; 'Use of the word nigger is a reference to terrible things and isn't okay. However using the word nigger to quickly reference terrible things that are happening to the white people in this song.. that's okay.

Nope. If I've not made myself clear by now, the lyric is far from being 'okay'. It's describing a horrible situation and referencing what the target of the song's venom would say. It's not using it casually and it is utterly condemning it.

That's why it's not 'okay' but is also highlighting a pretty awful attitude that needs condemning.

&gt; it's about you not actually having a stable position on ethics or censorship but just spouting 'I think this is wrong and shouldn't be allowed' then other times 'No this time it's ok because BLAH' banality anyway.

Nope. Not at all. Any my position is entirely stable.

I'm saying it's wrong to call people by racist terms, but if you're saying 'this guy shot someone and the authorities didn't care and just said 'one less *racial epithet*' and that's really fucking not okay', then *that's okay and the right thing to do*!

&gt;we're all just a bunch of racists or something who don't 'get it'.

What you don't seem to be getting is that there's a monstrously huge difference between calling someone a racist word and repeating a racist word that a racist would use. Which is what is happening in that song.

true,boq,eu,Bavaria,"&gt; Hopefully the Eurozone crisis has put Germany off any ideas of having a United States of Europe. If the idea ever gains traction again all we have to do is inform them who will be paying for it all.

Not really. Bavaria used to be a recipient of federal money for 40 years. The investment paid off, now it's one of Germany's most prosperous regions and has paid back way more than it ever took.

Anyway. You see, for many Germans this is not such a disruptive idea. So I have a local government (building playgrounds and other local issues), I have a district government (health facilities, â¦), a state government (education, police, â¦) and the federal German government (economic policy, foreign policy, â¦). Creating an additional layer on top for the things that the German federal government can't do that well any more isâ¦ well, not that big of a deal really. Every layer has its own set of jobs, a kind of European federation is just a new tool for a new set of problems.

I do believe this would be less controversial in Britain if it was a proper federation itself and not stuck somewhere between unitary statehood and devolution. Come to think of it, Britain left a lot of federations aroundâ¦ Canada, Australia, America, India. 

&gt; A United Europe would be a complete clusterfuck just as it is in America. Let's not drag ourselves backwards just for the sake of looking progressive. 

Why? Will we Europeans decide that universal health insurance suck just because we put together part of our governments? Will we decide that the death penalty is a good idea after all? Will we decide that poor people living on the streets is tolerable and social systems are unnecessary? Of course not. *No one* wants that.

On the other hand, the USA is the most prosperous and powerful country on the Earth *because* it is one and not 50 bickering states that work against each other all too often.

Like it or not, consent is a legal construct only, it has no bearing on the individuals capacity to make a decision ... and as such, should be judged also on an individual basis. Using emotive language like ""fucking kids"" just betrays your lack of a real argument.

Cool, but only if you go first.

Each time you've gone over the speed limit, 20 lashes.  Each time you've been drunk in public, 20 lashes.  Ordered a drink while drunk, 20 lashes.  Said something offensive in public, 20 lashes.  Driving around with an unsecured animal in the car:

Speeding and **dangerous driving**:  (Notice how on the first few seconds on a blind corner you're all over the road and into the other lane - stop driving like a dickhead please).

Citation needed. If you had your way, I would never have been born, as my mother was 31 and my father 17. So two vulnerable people taking advantage of each other is *more* acceptable than one vulnerable and one non-vulnerable? How does this work?

Seems like you're trying to reduce this whole thing to a fucking algorithm? A mathematical construct such as 9/5 + 32 determines if it's acceptable for two people to have sex? Or maybe, just maybe, you could consider the two people in question, their motives etc before casting your ""dice of doom"".

&gt; I don't care if the numbers were pulled out of someone's arse, their our numbers

Our way or the highway, making it meaningless. You didn't address my question earlier - do you consider HALF the worlds children as ""vulnerable"" or being abused simply because they have a different age of consent than where you live?

&gt; Legalising sex at 14 wouldn't suit our culture

So let's just pretend it never happens, despite all the evidence to the contrary, and in the mean time our kids take unneccessary risks and lack the education they need because ""it is written, thou shalt not fornicate before 16 years old"". Naive and stupid, you're on a roll.

&gt; our kids can barely read or write despite having easier GCSE's for the past few decades, imagine what it would be like of they weren't just fucking each other but everyone else.

They're doing it anyway! Why keep something ""illegal"" when it serves no purpose except to put 16+1 day age kids on a sex offenders list for life for the sole act of having sex with someone who two days earlier, would have been treated in a different manner?

&gt; at a time when they should be concentrating on starting their GCSE's

It is possible to do both things at the same time. Not in the examination room obviously, but you get my meaning.

&gt; It's not ""chav hate"", its a case of GCSE's have become increasingly easier for the past two decades yet kids are leaving school with such poor reading, maths and communication skills employers are jumping at the chance to hire Europeans immigrants over school leavers.

Yeah, this is all probably very true, but are you suggesting the whole reason for this is because kids are having sex under 16? It seems you've gone off on a tangent to the original issue.

&gt; I don't consider half the worlds children vulnerable because they aren't my fucking problem

And there we have it. So it's not about vulnerable kids at all, it's about you feeling ""morally superior"" to those dirty foreigners and their filthy underage sex habits. If you truly cared about the kids, then it wouldn't MATTER which country they were from.

One of the people I met there got stuck in their room, For some inexplicable reason the door to the room wouldn't open. It was unlocked the handle was turned but it wasn't budging... bloody old door, it was the first time I kicked a door in, It luckily didn't make any damage other than a chip around the frame, so nobody was any wiser and I made a new friend because of it.

On about day 3 it must have been about 10 at night, The houses were locked during the day because of everyone's valuables. So we were waiting for them to be unlocked, they had the lights on so you could see inside though. I spotted a man walking past the windows on the inside, I pointed him out to everyone too, they saw him as well. He was completely dressed in black (almost like a cloak he was wearing, a poncho even), I distinctly remember him almost awkwardly avoiding looking at us it seemed, then he headed towards the back of the house, out of sight. We just all thought he was a cleaner or something.

Well, the teachers and staff unlocked the houses for use to go inside and so we all went to sleep, The next morning I was making a brew and thought about what happened the night before, with the man in black. I realise that there was nowhere for that person to go without bumping into us the night beforehand and there was no reason for him to be inside a locked building...

true,teachbirds2fly,null,null,"&gt;I am considering giving my vote to UKIP on may 22nd. They are the only party I see that has the bollocks to actually do what they claim they will. I can respect that a lot.

And what's that then?

Their [31% flat tax rate, so working class pay more, while the richest in society get large tax cuts?](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/07/ukip-policies-manifesto-commitments) 

Their policy on [increasing military spending by 40%  when schools, hospitals, communities, infrastructure could do with that extra money but no a bigger army is what we need!](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/07/ukip-policies-manifesto-commitments)

Or what about their total ignorance to global warming arguably one of the biggest problems facing humanity today... an established science fact? [A great video on UKIP statements arguing ""a little bit of global warming will be good for us""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukzMSJV-bEw)

[What about their homophobic candidates?](http://www.newstatesman.com/staggers/2014/05/meet-ukips-seal-hating-gay-baiting-victim-blaming-newark-candidate-roger-helmer)

Or what about [dismantling the NHS as we know it and charging patients to use A&amp;E and GPs](http://www.leftfootforward.org/2013/07/ukip-wants-to-charge-nhs-patients-to-skip-waiting-times/) and creating a two tier system were people are allowed to pay to skip A&amp;E waiting times

What about the fact that they actually try and hamper/stop any good work the EU actually does? [""Six Ukip MEPS, including leader Nigel Farage, have come under heavy criticism after it emerged they had voted âNoâ to a resolution that would help prevent the illegal trade of ivory in Europe.""](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ukip-criticised-after-its-meps-vote-no-on-a-resolution-to-tackle-world-ivory-trade-9278390.html) 

As Owen Jones said [""They want to introduce a flat tax, which would not only cut the taxes of the investment bankers that ex-commodities trader Nigel Farage used to hang out with. It would mean that call centre workers would be in the same tax bracket as millionaires. They want to slash employers' National Insurance contributions, handing bosses a Â£50 billion cheque while workers struggle. They want to cut two million public sector jobs, not only decimating public services like education and health, but devastating entire communities. They want to go even further than the Tories in privatising and dismantling our NHS. They want a bonfire of our remaining workers' rights, trashing legislation on redundancy pay, holidays and overtime.""](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/an-open-letter-from-owen-jones-to-ukip-voters-9061968.html)

In fact, a federal model that counts us technically as ""one country"" would be vastly more efficient, more democratic, and would respect the freedoms of individual states far more. At the moment, the EU could do with democratic reforms, such as an elected second chamber, and the presidency replacing the commission. We could streamline the bureaucracy, such as firmly voting on one meeting place (Brussels, Strausbourg, or Luxembourg). 

At the moment, there are many laws which enact blancket rules over the EU. In a federal system, states could have power of veto for rules which are particularly detrimental. Imagine the united states, except the states have a higher degree of freedom, and the federal government exists only to express external soft and hard power, ensure the states maintain a form of fair, liberal, democratic governments, and represent citizens on the world stage.

And you're continually missing the point that the word is used precisely because it ***is*** bad. And I'm not for censoring any word. I'm for not dehumanising or degrading people, whether that's with language or actions.

Suggesting that quoting others that have used dehumanising language, ***to highlight and condemn those that would do this***, is one of the times it's okay to repeat those words, is in no way hypocrisy. 

I can't see how in any world this is random or arbitrary or hypocritical, which is what you're suggesting.

Okay, try this - Django Unchained and Blazing Saddles both use the word 'nigger' a hell of a lot. Are they racist and supportive of slavery and apartheid or dehumanising people? Hell no. Quite the opposite. They're using those words whilst attacking slavery and racism.

But there's nuance and room for change even when the same writer is concerned. Compare the books Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. The former was written at a time when Mark Twain didn't think much about slavery and racism and accepted it and it's just part of the backdrop. Huckleberry Finn was written later in his life when Twain had done a lot of thinking about this and completely condemns slavery and the way things were in America at the time. It's perhaps fair to say that Tom Sawyer is accepting of slavery and racism. Huckleberry Finn is attacking it. 

Is it hypocritical of me to say that Tom Sawyer is quite problematic, especially in its casual uses of the word 'nigger', but Huckleberry Finn goes some way towards redressing that and challenging it? Am I policing language by drawing distinctions there and suggesting nuance should be considered?

I don't think so, and I'll stand by this. If you disagree, fair enough, but I don't think you've got any case to call me a hypocrite or that my position is in any way contradictory.

No-one wins in such a situation.

And while it might be politically incorrect to say so; a tiny minority of people are just simply practically or actually unemployable, and are better off for everyone being paid a bare minimum standard of living to sit around and do nothing, or at least nothing negative - current policy is putting people with already difficult lives into actual life destroying debt and reliance on food banks, it's the societal equivalent of kicking someone when they're down.

true,nine8nine,cnty-england,England,"First of all although this socialism-lite fuck the rich philosophy seems to be popular on this sub it's not what drives 99% of ordinary people.

This is New Labour's fault, really. First they pretended the white working class didn't exist and then they famously decided to ""rub the right's nose in diversity"".

Well they didn't, rich Tories may affect a love of Britain but what they really care about is keeping businesses open and even richer investors coming in, immigration keeps wages down and makes us ""more competitive"". Every Tory I hear on the radio always wants to talk about the global race they see Britain competing in, we can't do that as a high wage economy with a massive trade deficit and no manufacturing.

If New Labour did one thing effectively however was rub the white working class's nose in diversity however, and if the white working class in this country has ever been anything it is traditionally minded, conservative with a small c and great believers in a proud British history (mythical or otherwise).

SO while Labour ignored these views for 13 years and neglected to keep immigration to sensible limits they opened the door wide for some among what remained of the working class, along with mainly lower-middle class voters, to form and support groups like UKIP, Britain First, the EDL, the English Democrats. 

UKIP has taken off because they make a political rights-based appeal to mainly older middle class voters who see the EU as part of the conflated immigration argument that in their minds means immigration is a mistake that has happened because British hands were tied by meddling foreigners.

At the lower end of the scale the white working class, despite it's former values, has put up with years of being thrown out on the dole and being treated like children, has given up many of its former strongholds, especially in London, where Whitechapel and the East End more generally used to be white and working class and is now Bangladeshi and mainly Muslim. Everywhere there is more pressure on housing, on emergency services, on schools, on benefits - we acknowledge this but if you stop someone in the street what's the most likely answer you'll get? Because of the rich tories? Or because they can see with their own two eyes that areas have changed so they are unrecognisable?

A change has undoubtedly taken place - a pretty vast cultural one in some areas, and the thing is, riots have been rare, law and order has been maintained, some people are allowed to go about wondering if they want an iphone 5S or a Galaxy S4, and under the surface of the society they think they live in this incredible resentment has been allowed to go unacknowledged, of a whole tranche of society abandoned and left to rot.

So while I don't condone any of these sub-fascist organisations, I can sort of see why they are here and whose fault it really is. Every day that passes the  the Guardian Newspaper attempts to peer further up its own arsehole on this issue, so no good guidance is coming from the Left at all besides the usual ""my best friend is a muslim and I think everyone should hold hands and be nice to one another"" bollocks.

So we get cheery working class fascists handing out leaflets with Churchill and Powell on our streets calling themselves the ""Christian Patrol"" and I genuinely think some people on /r/unitedkingdom are still puzzled as to where they came from.",1,1399760224,null,0,false,0,cheqbek,t3_257lgs,t1_cheqbek,t1_cheipks,null,1433740373,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Your choice, but as a higher rate tax payer, the tax efficiency of a pension will make it a lot easier to save for when you are not working.

They will either have to appeal or pay.  If they appeal the likelihood of it going away is vanishingly small.

As a higher rate tax payer if you pay Â£5,000 into your pension you'll get a 40% ""match"" (tax relief) from the government of Â£2,000 on top of any potential match from your employer (hopefully they provide a match!). Do you not trust the government enough to (quite literally) opt out of instant 40% gains? That doesn't include the tax free gains on your pension and the employer match, it's more likely to be well over 50%. 65 (well 68) is the **state** pension age, the private pension age (the age at which you can access (scheme dependant)) is currently 55 and assuming nothing changes in the next 13 years that's when you'll be able to access it. The chances of it going from 55 to 75 are almost nil, I'd bet my pension on it never happening before you reach 55.

A pension is very likely to be the right choice for you, and you need to be contributing about 30% of your income to catch up to where you need to be if you want to retire comfortably. Speak to your employer ASAP about any pension option they have available to you. Now is the time to seriously double down on your retirement planning, the longer your investments are growing the more gains you'll get, at 42 you're way behind so you're going to have to focus on this seriously to catch up, contributing 5% is not going to do you any good, it needs to be *at least* 20% IMO and 30% if you want a chance of catching up to where you should be.

There are always people that abuse things, it doesn't matter whether it's health care, financial support from parents/friends, kindness from strangers or kindness from charities.

However, what you said is wildly misleading.  

Having a company car isn't tax avoidance.  In fact if there's any non-business use it's a taxable benefit.

A self-employed person can claim a deduction for many expenses an employee taxed under PAYE can, but this isn't tax avoidance.  It might be unfair, but that doesn't make it avoidance.

Many of these schemes engineer a loss practically out of thin air.  This decision hasn't been published yet, so I can't tell you what the mechanism was.  But in the recent Chris Moyles case he claimed to be trading in used cars without actually buying or selling so much as a single car.  The losses were engineered entirely on paper.  In the Jimmy Carr case instead of taking pay he contracted his services through a Jersey company and took the money back out as a loan.

Commercial tax avoidance is fundamentally different to the fact that a self-employed plumber can treat the cost of driving from one job to another as a business expense and my commute to work isn't tax deductible.

If we are looking for a creative CM to sit in deep with Matic I personally think that Miralem Pjanic (who is 23) would be more well suited for the role than the other two. Pjanic has the experience of playing at top clubs (Lyon and Roma) and has Champions League experience to go with that. His performances throughout the past year or so at Roma are comparable to that or Rakitic at Sevilla. Rakitic was the captain for Sevilla which could prove tricky to pry him away from them especially because they're in Europa League now.

I don't fully understand the maths behind how this is proven but it comes from the fact that the amount of grandparents doubles for each generation back - 2 grandparents, 4 greatgrandparents etc, which because more and more are shared the further back you go means that 1 person from back then is the ancestor of everyone.

I think it's important, from both perspectives, to see the police as human. These officers improved their community relations in a context-appropriate way. 

Would it have been appropriate to do it in a quiet residential area at 5am? No. But this was an extremely localised method of improving relations with the police and the people they're looking after, which benefits both. When the police are seen as the opposition, things escalate.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I actually have no clue. We really haven't been linked to him by any credible sources. Believe it or not, I honestly think I was the one who started this Rakitic thing on this sub. I watch Sevilla whenever they are on my TV because I just love the squad and besides RM they are my favorite team in La Liga to watch, and getting to see Marin was also a bonus. But Rakitic is a player that I have adored for a while and this season he has became one of the best players in the world and the best midfielder in La Liga outside of Madrid and Barca.

He is exactly what we have needed in midfield and he still hasn't signed a contract renewal. Thats why I have said over the course of the last few months he should be a transfer target for us.

When I was commenting about this I don't think anyone else on this sub even mentioned his name, let alone know about him (maybe except the Croatians).

I remember searching for any articles linking him to us when I first realized how great he would be for Chelsea and I think I found 2 in total and both were from random ""transfer news"" sites that were far from credible, and to make matters worse they didn't mention anything besides Chelsea and a few other teams ""tracking"" him. After telling others about him and him getting much more recognition as the season go on do I think people on this sub started talking about him more, so really its more of a hope than something with concrete backing or really strong rumors.

**TLDR:** I watch Sevilla and witnessed first hand at how Rakitic ripped up the league and was one of the first, if not the first, to even mention his name on the sub. He has only gotten better since and others have started to slowly chime in. There have never been any strong rumors about Chelsea trying to get him away from Sevilla and when I first started talking about it only 2 articles concerning Rakitic and Chelsea even came up from a Google search, and neither were even credible or talking about us individually (they were talking about a collection of top teams). So yeah, it is far from a shoe in.

This applies in varying proportions to 88% of Irish, 81% of Welsh, 79% of Cornish, 70% of the people of Scotland and its associated islands and 68% (over two thirds) of the English and their politically associated islands. These figures dwarf any perception of Celtic or Anglo-Saxon ethnicity based on concepts of more recent, massive invasions ... There is certainly a deep genetic division between peoples of the west and east coasts of the British Isles, particularly between the English and the Welsh, but this does not merely reflect the Anglo-Saxon, Viking and Norman invasions. These were only the most recent of a succession of waves of cultural and genetic influx from north-west Europe, going back to the first farmers and before.

Rakitic is much better defensively as well, and much more experienced.

true,summatclever,eng-Worcestershire,"Worcs ","&gt; In summary, Oppenheimer states: The most important message of my genetic story is that three quarters of British ancestors arrived long before the first farmers. This applies in varying proportions to 88% of Irish, 81% of Welsh, 79% of Cornish, 70% of the people of Scotland and its associated islands and 68% (over two thirds) of the English and their politically associated islands. These figures dwarf any perception of Celtic or Anglo-Saxon ethnicity based on concepts of more recent, massive invasions ... There is certainly a deep genetic division between peoples of the west and east coasts of the British Isles, particularly between the English and the Welsh, but this does not merely reflect the Anglo-Saxon, Viking and Norman invasions. These were only the most recent of a succession of waves of cultural and genetic influx from north-west Europe, going back to the first farmers and before.

His findings are not without controversy (and I'm not an expert in the field by any means, so couldn't offer my view), but there's real evidence to back up what the OP is saying. 

Personally I'm not sure what genetics has to do with it. There are African ethnic groups which have only arrived in their current homelands in the past millennium, the same for the Maoris of New Zealand, who arrived circa 11th century. Do these people have no claim to the land because they're 'immigrants'? Personally, I think it's absurd to say we're a nation of immigrants based on migrations 1500 years ago.

Rafa is a hell of manager who wins everywhere he goes (Inter was the only place where he didn't post a minimum 50% win percentage and he still posted a 48% with them).

However Rafa has a few issues, he is an arrogant ass and he likes to spend money.

He shouldn't be hyped up the way he is, especially on this sub-reddit. He is extremely raw. I see people on here trying to compare him to Varane. But Raphael was much more composed and a much more refined defender when RM got him in comparison to Zouma. At Madrid his ability to be a rock solid but still be able to remain calm has still remained one of his best attributes. Zouma is rash, aggressive and uses his physicality to the limit. All I can say about it is when it works, it works. But when it doesn't, its pretty bad. 

Zouma is a physical beast, but he is still lacking in all the other departments that are vital for a defender to become one of the best.

Though he was not the first to rule over all of Great Britain, King James VI/I was probably the first to wear the triple crown (that is the Kingdoms of England, Ireland, and Scotland). While yes he never got his wish merging the Kingdoms of England and Scotland into one, and the Kingdoms were somewhat separate^ to one another. The fact remained that these Kingdoms had to work together instead of fighting one another. When it comes to the act of union in 1707 people forget that dynastic ties played a role. England and Scotland had differing views on who should be King/Queen after Queen Anne died. The English government (and hence Irish government too) wanted some one who wasn't a Catholic or married to one so they wanted Electress Sophia (Act of Settlement). The Scottish government wanted someone from the Scottish line (Act of Security). This, along with the failed colony, lead to the Act of Union in 1707.

Indeed during the same time there was the war of Spanish Succession which GB fought in to prevent a personal union between Spain and France from occurring. I don't know any more than that, which is shame as it seems an interesting event in history.

TLDR: The point being is that European countries in the past could be united through more peaceful ways.

I totally understand what you mean, though. We've got Champions League and can attract Champions League quality players. But 99.9% of Liverpool fans would be gutted if he left. This is because the team has been built around Suarez. When our focus was on Carroll and Suarez, we hardly scored goals and that costed Kenny his job. If he leaves that leaves a gaping hole in our attack. Sure we did fine without him at the start of the season, but we only scored one goal per game.

&gt;

&gt;The __TARDIS__   (/ËtÉËdÉªs/; __T__ime __a__nd __R__elative __D__imension __i__n __S__pace)  is a fictional [time machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel) and [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft) in the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) programme *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)* and its associated spin-offs.

&gt;A TARDIS is a product of the advanced technology of the [Time Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord), an extraterrestrial civilisation to which the programme's central character, the [Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)), belongs. A properly maintained and piloted TARDIS can transport its occupants to any point in time and any place in the universe. The interior of a TARDIS is much larger than its exterior, which can blend in with its surroundings using the ship's ""chameleon circuit"". TARDISes also possess a degree of [sentience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience) (which has been expressed in a variety of ways ranging from implied machine personality and [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will) through to the use of a conversant [avatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar)) and provide their users with additional tools and abilities including a [telepathically based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepathy) universal translation system.

&gt;In the series, the Doctor pilots an apparently unreliable, obsolete Type 40, Mark 1   TARDIS. Its chameleon circuit is broken, leaving it stuck in the shape of a 1960s-style London [police box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_box) after a visit to London in 1963.  The Doctor's TARDIS was for most of the series' history said to have been stolen from the Time Lords' home planet, [Gallifrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallifrey), where it was old, decommissioned and derelict (and, in fact, in a museum).  However, during the events of ""[The Doctor's Wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doctor%27s_Wife_(Doctor_Who\))"" (2011), the ship's consciousness briefly inhabits a human body named Idris, and she reveals that far from being stolen, she left of her own free will. During this episode, she flirtatiously implies that she ""stole"" the Doctor rather than the other way around, although she does also refer to him as her ""thief"" in the same episode.

Cissokho came on loan and we can't sell him. 

Flanno is a good player, but we can't have him in the side starting unless we have an attack minded fullback opposite him, which Cole no longer is. Fullback is one position where we have space to bring in a world class player.

Lallana is a good player, but he'll cost too much. It's not terrible, though, but he doesn't add goals to the #10 position, which is what I think we need,

I think Borini can be a good player for us--perhaps Kuyt level. But remember he's scored 10 goals for Sunderland, he hasn't lit the world on fire despite scoring in some big games (he takes PKs for Sunderland, by the way).

It's hard for people on reddit (usually 20-something, uni students or recent graduates, mostly aspiring middle class) to see why so many people have been pissed off by the last 15 years. Poor people in their 30's and upwards have seen their jobs go to immigrants, their local high streets changed to shops with foreign writing on them, their neighbours changed and have 3-5 kids, and their local GP surgery waiting room is now full of women in saris. They see this as too much change, as well as a strain on local resources. We can laugh and scorn at them, but those people have the exact same right to an opinion (and to vote) as any of the rest of us ""enlightened"" Guardian readers.

I think reddit seriously underestimates the number of people who are very unhappy with those changes. Labour caused most of the problem.

Read some facts here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom

10% of newborns can certainly become a majority when you consider the context. Firstly, Islam has the highest adherence rate of any religion. i.e. the 10% of children born as Muslims will likely stay Muslim, marry another Muslim, then raise their kids as Muslim. So you don't have the typical ""loss"" when Christian parents have a child who ends up not following any religion.

The birth rate is also higher. And it doesn't have to take 100's of years to make significant demographic shifts. If you look at small areas of the country where immigration and births have been concentrated, Islam is getting close to a majority. That wiki article shows over 20 places in the UK where the Muslim population is greater than 15%. Bradford is 25% Muslim. Is it inconceivable that they will become a majority in a few cities within a few decades? Also, factor in that at a certain tipping point, many non-Muslims will end up moving out. 

You know, this is the problem with this whole debate. Nobody wants to actually talk facts. The right peddle bullshit about the sky falling and beheadings in the street. But the left just ignore problems and accuse everyone who disagrees of being racist. We do need to have a serious discussion about the role of Islam in this country.

&gt;Do these arguments hold water? It is perfectly possible that adherents to non-Muslim religions would prefer to eat non-halal meat. I can understand why there is a case to be made for clearer labelling so that consumers can make an informed choice.

According to the Food Standards Agency, 88% of halal meat in the UK comes from animals that have been stunned before slaughter. In fact, there is no technical difference between the methods used to produce most halal meat and mainstream methods of slaughter.

They supported the team since the lower divisions and acknowledge they're lucky to get the break they got and now can be considered a force in football. The fake ones who jump in see your team as one that is good now, and feel like they deserve things handed to them. Then again, so do such fickle minded fans of any top clubs.

true,patmools,null,null,"1. Almost all undergraduate degrees in the UK are three years, so this is not usually a disadvantage.
2. It is actually possible to switch courses. The Cambridge ""Tripos"" degree system is divided into two ""Parts"". Once you've done Part I it is possible to switch to a different course for Part II. See [here](http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/structure.html). As for employment opportunities, you will find in the UK that in non-scientific fields graduate employers tend to be more interested in the fact that you have a degree than what subject you happened to do it in.
3. It depends who you ask! :) There are loads of drinking societies in Cambridge, but they're a bit different to frats. Have a read of [this thread](http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=1219950).
4. You might get called a Yank occasionally, because we are ignorant and think the term applies to all Americans. However there are lots of nationalities represented in the student body and most people aren't bothered.

If you want to avoid some lighthearted abuse for ""misuse of the language that *we* invented"" here are some top tips:

* *School* is almost never used in Britain to refer to a *university*. If you talk about *going to school* most Brits will think you are talking about your childhood education. If you want to look really British, call it *uni* instead.
* *College* is a really problematic word because it is used for many different things (see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College)). As you know Cambridge is unique as the *university* is made up of *constituent colleges*. If you use *college* to mean anything other than one of the *constituent colleges* you will end up very confused.
* There is a lot of Cambridge jargon which you will pick up quickly. Be warned that much of it is unknown to anyone outside the town!",0,1399795778,null,0,1399817175,0,chf1x0f,t3_258sbo,t1_chf1x0f,t3_258sbo,null,1433745972,12,false,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,12

If you are looking to get financial advice, pay for it. If you don't want to pay for it just understand you are getting a sales pitch, not advice. 

Shop around. Have an idea what you want to invest in. Do you want exposure to the UK markets, or a more balanced portfolio of global investment grade stuff. Do you want to invest in emerging markets? What's your risk appetite - what would you be willing to lose for the opportunity for higher gains, or would you prefer something more balanced that will have a lot of fixed income and be stable but unspectacular. 

For example, a very cheap investment is the Scottish Widows FTSE100 ""tracker"" (it's not a perfect track, but close). Since it's easy to administer, and cheap to administer, they don't charge much for it. But you don't get great diversification from it. But if you believe in the UK economy and thing it's going to do better over the next few years it might be a great choice.

true,blackrat47,Downing,Downing,"1) UK graduates are actually quite sought after for stuff like grad school in the US. It's because the course is only 3 years, but the whole course is focused on our 'major', rather than spending the first couple of years filling out credits for the sake of it and the last couple of years spending 1/3 of your time on a minor. Where in the US you really have to do a masters to be considered to have specialised in your subject (or most PhDs come with a couple of years of teaching equivalent to a Masters), it's not rare for Cambridge students to go straight from their 3-year undergrad to a fully-research PhD. This is just an example- the same goes for industries dependent on specific courses.

2) Switching course is possible, although not recommended. Certain courses have quite a lot of fluidity built into them: for example, you can go between more or less any of the sciences (and probably psych) up to your final year, go from maths to physics, medicine to science etc. I know people who did a year of medicine and then switched to law. It's not unusual to go into careers outside of your subject (I'm a biologist turned software engineer), either- although HSPS -&gt; finance could be a bit tricky, depending on what sort of finance you're going into (consulting/ management might be fine, but you don't want to be going for the same jobs as mathematicians/ physicists). A Cambridge degree stands up better than most at going into different fields, though, as our first years are relatively general, and it's a big name.

3) University sport in the UK is nowhere near as big a deal as college sport in the US, even in stuff not in BUCS/ NCAA respectively. That said, Cambridge is a bit of an exception with rowing. But I don't recommend rowing. Anyway, it can be as much or as little of your social scene as you want it to be- if you rowed, you wouldn't have much option of who to spend free time with because you don't have any. Non-sport societies are generally weekly or less frequently than that, so I, for one, never built up much of a social circle around them.

As an American, there's a fair chance you may have played some ultimate? If so (or if not, really...), I highly recommend checking out the uni ultimate team, Strange Blue (and their devilishly attractive and modest captains)- just come off a double BUCS championship season. And we're a nice bunch.

true,sionnach,null,null,"If you only want to out it away for a year, just put it in a cash ISA. Any investment vehicle will have initial charges etc, that make it in reality a 3 year (minimum!) investment. More like 5-7. A one year time horizon will almost be guaranteed to lose you money, unless you put it in something like a Latin American growth fund - but then again, you could lose a fortune too. Or, you could open an ISA share dealing account and choose your own companies to buy shares of - but again, highly risky. 

So in reality with a 12 month outlook and a cast iron guarantee your money will still be there in full in 12 months time, look up the cash ISA ""best buy"" tables and go with the one at the top. Most ISAs allow you to transfer in a previous ISA from another account (no affect on your despot limit for the year) if you want to keep it all in the one place, but some of the top performers don't because it costs them money to do so in order to offer the top rate they don't allow it. Doesn't make a huge difference in your case, but if you had Â£100k in ISA savings elsewhere it would. 

Many ISAs pay interest annually. And may have significant penalties if you withdraws money before then. So unless you are SURE you won't want to withdraw before 12 months, look for an account that has monthly interest payments and minimal penalties for early withdrawal. The Newcastle BS 3.02% one might suit you as it pays monthly and only has a small withdrawal penalty. 

Have a look at my pal Martin's web site for details of cash ISAs and the best buy tables.

If this were a matter of a fast food chain writing Bible verses on napkins then The Guardian would happily allow columnists to express their indignation.  And UK redditors would happily join in about how they dislike seeing religion in a restaurant.  That they don't see why they should have to look at Bible verses just because some Christians like it.

But, because it's Islam, it seems that we're not allowed to object in the slightest that all meat in some chain restaurants is now slaughtered by having its throat slit in accord with 7th century Saudi Arabian superstitious beliefs.  


Edit:  [From The Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/what-is-halal-meat-the-big-questions-about-religious-slaughter-answered-9331519.html):

&gt;Halal slaughter of animals was conceived on the historical principle that it was one of the more humane methods available.  Yet now the RSPCA says that, when compared to methods that involve stunning the animal beforehand, it can cause unnecessary suffering, pain and distress.

&gt;Between 84 and 90 per cent of animals killed for halal meat in the UK are processed by one of the large number of halal slaughterhouses which do use electric stunning beforehand.

&gt;This does, however, leave a significant minority of animals which are killed without being stunned first, at one of a reported 12 slaughterhouses in the UK which still perform the more traditional practice, endorsed by Islamic scholars, of keeping the animal conscious when its throat is cut.

Concerned about any of that?  You must be a bigot.  

Edit II:  As I mention in another comment below - in discussions like this, those defending the religious will generally point to only the most moderate end of the spectrum.  Who could really argue against halal if it simply involves someone muttering a quick prayer?  (Well, I could, but I don't really think it's that big of a deal.)  But then, when I try to find out  what actual Muslims think halal slaughter should involve I find texts like this:

&gt;The animal to be slaughtered must be from the categories that are permitted for Muslims to eat. The animal must be alive at the time of slaughter. No electric shock, bullet or any other means should be used before slaughtering. Using any such method may lead to the death of the animal before it is cut. Islam prohibits Muslims from eating any meat coming from an animal that is dead before slaughter. Muslims are also advised to avoid eating anything doubtful. The animal must be slaughtered by the use of a sharp knife. The knife must not kill due to its weight. If it kills due to the impact the meat may not be permissible. The windpipe (throat), food-tract (oesophagus) and the two jugular veins must be cut. The slaughtering must be done in one stroke without lifting the knife. The knife should not be placed and lifted when slaughtering the animal. Slaughtering must be done by a sane adult Muslim. Animals slaughtered by a Non Muslim will not be Halal.

That's the first return on a Google search for 'halal slaughter' and it's from [a page put up by 'The Dept of Halal certification'.](http://halalcertification.ie/halal/islamic-method-of-slaughtering/)  (Edit: Appears to be an Irish site, but it's fairly representative it seems from looking at other links.)

When the original set was built, the intention was to make it bigger with other areas (balconies and walkways for instance) that could be used for filming, but were never really utilized. The new set is self-contained, so they can do more interesting traveling shots, without having to deal with missing walls and such.

You can google for better calculators. This one is way to simple to be used for planning, but I hope it makes the point. Not working for any significant period is a very expensive lifestyle.

More pressingly, you are about to take on a mortgage in addition to the two dependants you already have and you have no savings. What is the plan if the roof needs fixing, credit card? What if another disaster happens while you are still paying that off? This is how people loose houses...

In my opinion your first priority is an emergency fund (google knows). It will require you to cut the fat out of your budget which will make pension saving easier.

I live in the Hague, the Netherlands.  One day I went shopping for groceries, I wore a City hoodie. when I was waiting in the line, a man came up to me because he saw my hoodie. He asked if I was a City fan, of course I said yes. He told me he was a City fan too, and that he moved from Manchester to the Hague just some years ago. After a small chat he asked my adress, I didn't know why at the moment but I just gave him my adress. I went home and nothing special happened untill evening came. Someone knocked on the door, it turned out to be the guy I met earlier that day. He brought a bag and asked me to open it. Inside the bag was a city training shirt! As a person who has never been in touch with other City fans besides Twitter and Reddit it was one of the greatest moments in my life. It also made me realize how much I love the City community, and that I should never leave it. City till I die!

You could easily drop Â£20 on the internet, Â£50 on the phone and Â£100 on the gym. Â£600 on food is, well, ridiculous. Â£400 would be high but lets say saving Â£200 on food. I imagine you can save loads on the bills, what are you spending Â£400 a month on?

Without knocking anything off the bills that's Â£370is a month or Â£3500 a year, Â£10k in savings in three years.

true,mysterydetectivemyst,null,null,"I was better off for knowing, mostly because it made me a lot more careful. I work in a physical industry - lifting wheelbarrows, manhandling alpacas, moving adult carpet pythons big enough to need three people, and bathing dogs that don't want baths - and when I thought it was just a pulled muscle, I wasn't planning on reducing my activity very much.

Learning that I had two fractured ribs was good for me. You're right, the general medical consensus is ""leave it alone"", but I wouldn't have done that if I hadn't gone to the GP and found out what was really wrong. If I had to pay for that appointment, I wouldn't have gone, and likely would have avoided things that caused a lot of pain, but I wouldn't have been very careful. A cracked rib can turn into a completely broken rib if it's put under too much stress, and then I would have been in real trouble.

Basically, knowing stopped me from ignoring what was wrong and potentially making it worse.

I'm not objecting to the idea of a charge for *missed* appointments, but outright charging for appointments sounds like a very bad idea.

I move around a lot, and rarely bother to register with a surgery. I just walk into the nearest one when I have a problem and ask for an appointment. Once or twice I've been required to fill in a form to register at that surgery, but I've still been given an appointment. Otherwise, I've gotten one anyway - usually after having given them my phone number and somewhere to send post. A simple ""I don't live around here"" has resulted in an appointment the same day on a few occasions, and I only had to wait a couple of hours. What I'm saying is that if you really need to see a GP, you don't have to be registered with a surgery.

I'm generally weak of constitution, and have a few minor long-term conditions, so I'm nervous of anything different my body does, and have a habit of visiting a GP for any prolonged pain or wounds that take an unusual length of time to heal or an inflamed mucous membrane. I work with animals, and even observing every hygeine and barrier rule there is, it's still possible that I could catch a zoonosis, or transfer an anthroponosis to one of the animals, so I really can't afford to *not* visit a doctor when something seems odd.",0,1399805593,null,0,false,0,chf3d3k,t3_2579x9,t1_chf3d3k,t1_chf34u1,null,1433746654,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Clearly this is a reference to your specific upbringing and is in no way meant to make a statement about mine despite your statement that you think we come from, quote, ""different flocks in different fields""

So I guess I can just call you a wanker and make absolutely no implications about your prolific masturbation, right?


&gt;Small, local communities

Like London, which receives much of the intake in regards to immigration? If all it takes to break down a small community is the arrival of a few immigrants then it probably wasn't much of a community to begin with.

&gt;So, he is not lying there, to me.

Ah yes, the old ""truth is subject to perspective"" rule, favoured of Obi-Wan Kenobi and most politicians. Fun fact, we just just as many and sometimes more immigrants from outside the EU as we do from EU citizens (http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/dcp171778_335330.pdf ) so given that in such instances we have total soverign control of our borders...how does Farage's non-idea help reduce immigration for what was in 2013 more than a hundred thousand more immigrants than those that came from the EU? 

&gt;Most politicians have never known poverty, and it's not a criteria into understanding issues at hand.

Sorry, when you build a reputation as being anti-establishment, call Scottish Nations an ""ugly union"" for wanting independence from England (no parallels there at all. Nope.) and generally assert that the political classes are the out-of-touch posh boys that, to be honest, they overwhelmingly are then you yourself cannot afford to be the establishment-fed, establishment-backed, taxpayer-funded, posh boy that you yourself so claim to bloody well hate.

&gt;You obviously have no connection to politicians, and despise them (or the system) either way that's the opposite of me,

Once again an assertion about me personally. Given that that didn't work out so well for you last time I'd suggest against trying it again.

For what it's worth, I don't think the system is working in the favour of the majority (much like Farge) and I don't think the current political class have it in them to help the majority of people (much like Farage) and I'll even admit as to some doubts as to the current immigration policy and our policies on things like extradition (much like Farage) the only difference between me and Farage is that I include Farage in that thinking because, surprise surprise, Farage is part of the system, head of a political party and has been now for...what? Four years? So really if you find me and my views so distasteful then why on earth are you voting for buddy boy with the beer?

&gt;Good luck with your life, I'll stick with voting UKIP.

You know. One of the hardest issues for Republicans in the US over the course of George Bush's Presidency was how to evade and undermine the scandals that befell him (and towards the end of his Presidency there were many) but they found to their delight that the Democratic Party weren't making full use of these scandals as political leverage. Nigel Farage has been under so much scandal that he's been reduced to having to literally show off minorities (that he would presumably want to bar from entering the country if he were in charge) to fight accusations of racism. Pray tell, how do you suppose UKIP will survive in Government and facing the scrutiny that the party in power faces when even when not in power and facing the bare minimum of scrutiny they are being forced to evict members and MEPs alike in a manner not unlike a scorned child hurling toys out of a pram?",0,1399805841,null,0,false,0,chf3ebb,t3_253eka,t1_chf3ebb,t1_chetfa3,null,1433746671,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,olibentley,null,null,"I am at Jesus. Answering the other comment, we do get free access to the sports centre on Iffley Road, so you can go into the gym or pool whenever you like. 

I highly recommend joining our boat club or one of our other sports teams. The boat club has undergrads and postgrads training together, which everyone enjoys as they get to meet people from other parts of the university. We now employ professional coaches, even at novice level, to help you get to a high standard of rowing quickly.

For other sports, Jesus has teams for Rugby, Football, Hockey, Cricket and a few others. If you're interested in a more obscure sport you may have to go to a university-level club.

On the accommodation front, I highly recommend living in college owned-property, at least in your first year. All college accommodation have on-site maintenance people to fix any problems you may have, often the same day you report it. They are much easier to deal with than private landlords. You will also have access to the college hall for meals.

You will probably get four options for college accommodation.

1: Living in the college itself. These rooms are nice, often very pretty, but usually saved for first year undergrads. You would probably end up in a double-set (sharing a bathroom and living space with another person, with separate bedrooms). You will be in the centre of town and will not need a bike, but you will not have your own kitchen, you have to eat in hall or go out to eat.

2: Living on ship street. I've not seen these rooms, but I know several people that live here. These rooms have a small kitchen between several people (maybe four?) Again you are very central.

3: Living at 121 Woodstock Road. These rooms are newer and more spacious, again with a kitchen between about four people, and two bathrooms between four. This building is about a ten minute walk north of central Oxford.

4: Living on Herberts Close. There are several blocks of accommodation here, but they are all very similar. They are the most modern of the colleges postgrad accommodation. They all have a kitchen and two bathrooms between three or four people. They are on the same site as the college sports grounds, which are very pretty. The site is about a half hour walk East from central Oxford, so it is worth investing in a bike or bus pass. (Buses stop about 100m away, every 2 or 3 minutes). I would recommend staying in Herberts Close (a.k.a Bart's).

The older the accommodation is, the more likely you will find it cold in the winter, and it may still have the old fashioned, electric radiators.

Jesus is a really friendly college. We are on the smaller side in terms of student numbers, but we are very tight knit. In particular, you will get to know the MCR (Middle Common Room, like a student union for postgrads at Jesus), very well. They have lots of social nights on, at least one a week. Our favourites are ""Cheese and Wine"" (which is free!) and ""Champagne and Chocolates"". They also have officers in charge of your welfare and pretty much anything else you might need.

In terms of general advice, I'm not sure if you need to know anything else! You may find working in Oxford different to anywhere else, but we certainly have a social atmosphere unlike anywhere else too, and there is an army of people here whose job it is to look after your welfare.

Your (new) job will likely deduct your student loan for you via the PAYE system, so I would let that pay itself off slowly via your monthly salary. It's something like Â£50/month, so not much of a dent.

**Monthly take home**

At Â£22k you should be earning about Â£1300-Â£1400 a month after NI, tax and your student loan deductions. Have a look at http://listentotaxman.com and enter your details there to find out the exact number.

**Additional living costs**

I would factor in another Â£200/month for bills including council tax, and another Â£150/month for food depending on your lifestyle. So we're looking at around Â£650/month living expenses.

**Disposable income**

After this let's say you have Â£800/month disposable income. As your debt isn't too high, even with a shitty APR, you're not getting too screwed by the servicing costs. However I'd still want to clear it soon to help your credit rating, and to get in to a good habit of not being in debt.

**Spending allocation**

With that Â£800, I'd apportion it down to the following:

* Â£200/month Barclaycard repayment, with a view to paying this off after 5 months and closing down the account.
* Â£200/month student overdraft repayment, leaving you with Â£1000 interest free headroom after 5 months - handy for buying a car
* Â£400 spending money - to use as you like. Personally I would save another Â£200/month as you'll need money for a rental deposit as well as any insurance costs, but it's down to you.

**edit:** As for your current situation, just make sure that you're on the cheapest phone tariff available for your requirements, you have a student/16-25 railcard for any travel needed, and that you don't put any more money on your CC. Prioritise servicing the debts with the highest interest repayments first, which again, is your CC.

**tl;dr: Without knowing when your interest free overdraft expires, the general strategy I'd take is clear off your Barclaycard asap, then move on to your overdraft. If you can manage the money well enough you will have enough credit or cash to buy a car and insure it, as well as pay your rent deposit + first month. The timeframe for this is 5 months. After you've done that, time to start saving for emergency fund, pensions, ISAs, blah blah blah...**",0,1399808325,null,0,1399809577,0,chf3ro9,t3_259u9k,t1_chf3ro9,t3_259u9k,null,1433746851,5,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,5

Good work getting out of that, and congrats on the job :) Next goal would be pay off the barclaycard and getting out of your overdraft. The student loan can be left as-is (generally, it's hardly a priority at the moment, and if you're on the old scheme it's growing slower than inflation).

&gt; So really what I'd like to know is how best to start saving/investing my money

Make a budget and stick to it. You'll have about Â£1450 to use per month.

&gt; how to prioritise clearing my debts

Highest interest rate first, and try and get them paid off as quickly as possible. Your student overdraft will stop being free at some point but I'd get your card paid off first. Given you're staying at home for a few months, keep your lifestyle as simple as possible (don't start getting coffees every morning for example) and pay those off *heavily*. It's Â£3k which you can hammer pretty quickly given your current budget then you can be debt free! Then you should be able to comfortably save and enjoy stuff at the same time rather than handing money over to debts.

&gt; is how best to start saving/investing my money

Join the company pension scheme as soon as possible! It's free money and best to start paying in early and before you start getting used to the money.

Other than that, get an emergency fund that covers ~3 - 6 months of your expenses. It'll smooth out a huge amount of bumps and mean you don't have to worry about things. This should be in something like an ISA, easily accessible.

Beyond that, look at starting a pension or investing in low cost index fund trackers. This should be for long term (20+ year) savings. The earlier you start the less you have to put in, thanks to compound interest.

&gt; while hopefully trying to build my credit rating.

Have direct debits and always have enough money to cover them, pay off your credit card in full each month, and make sure you're on the electoral roll. Basically, show you're responsible with money and people can trust you if they lend you money.

Finally, this is all just stranger-on-the-internet advice. You need to research things like investing and pensions to ensure you understand the risks.",0,1399808868,null,0,false,0,chf3uta,t3_259u9k,t1_chf3uta,t3_259u9k,null,1433746886,5,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,5

No electric shock, bullet or any other means should be used before slaughtering. Using any such method may lead to the death of the animal before it is cut. Islam prohibits Muslims from eating any meat coming from an animal that is dead before slaughter. Muslims are also advised to avoid eating anything doubtful.
The animal must be slaughtered by the use of a sharp knife. The knife must not kill due to its weight. If it kills due to the impact the meat may not be permissible.
The windpipe (throat), food-tract (oesophagus) and the two jugular veins must be cut.
The slaughtering must be done in one stroke without lifting the knife. The knife should not be placed and lifted when slaughtering the animal.
Slaughtering must be done by a sane adult Muslim. Animals slaughtered by a Non Muslim will not be Halal.

That's quite a big difference from just saying a prayer don't you think?

Bear in mind also that many of us, myself included, would rather not be self employed and have the instability that goes with it. I'm not some entrepreneur but rather forced into it due to the nature of post recession employment markets.

Being self employed doesn't mean having a Cayman Islands bank account and a yacht. For many of us it's a month by month challenge to keep the bills paid while constantly fighting to get back from HMRC what is rightfully ours.

AVB was getting results, and I'm fairly certain Levy is a smart enough man to know replacing a manager who is doing ""ok"" with a settling team is a bad idea.

Therefore I would be fairly confident there is another element to the sacking. AVB did clash with the Medical team, there was a fair bit of drama aired in public, I'm fairly confident Sherwood would have slithered in with opinions every now and again as well.

It probably meant that behind the scenes it was very fractured and full of in-fighting and the removal of Villas-Boas helped to settle that down. Quite possibly AVB was in a position where even if he stayed, things would have got worse despite results on the pitch.

We only know what the press says and occasionally what players say and we all interpret them differently, often suiting our arguement. Until something i official or until we hear from people who are experiencing this on a first hand basis i don't think its right to assume he will be leaving.

I personally don't think tim is right for the club. I also don't want to lose him, and i do not want yet more instabvility. Therefore i believe personally he will either stay for the sake of stability until the next season or will run down his contract so that we do not have to fire him (because being given the ultimatum of being asked to take a demotion or be fired, tim will likely want to be fired so that he can keep open for managerial positions.

As i say, you, i or anyone in this thread for this matter cannot comment on what to happen. We are only viewing the opinions and filtered information through various media platforms and we never get first hand experience of the situation.

So i don't hink its right that we believe he is going as a certainty (i for one wouldn't be surprised if he went) but we cannot assume he is going from the information we have.

There are reasons for him staying (stability and not losing his talent with the youth) and i don't feel as if these are ever considered in this forum or ele where for that matter.

I'm just playing devils advocate because i'm fed up of people getting their pitchforks out without considering the whole situation, which WE DO NOT KNOW!

true,ninereeds314,null,null,"&gt; ""Cowardice""... Would you mind expanding on that? I mean, ""cowardly"" implies that folks can't really be wanting to avoid upsetting or insulting historically (and currently) marginalised minority groups (I avoid the word ""offend"" for obvious reasons), but rather they're being forced to by someone.

We have no evidence that the complainer was a member of any minority group. All we know about the complainer was offended by a word. We also have no evidence of any racist intent. Seriously, the song involved is ""The Sun Has Got His Hat On"" - did you ever notice that the N-word is in that song?

&gt;  It implies that the bosses, if left to their own devices, wouldn't give a toss, but instead they're being forced into complying either the BBC's standards and/or equality legislation...

No, I'm implying that left to their own devices, the BBC bosses would recognize that pushing for a resignation over an innocent mistake is an absurd over-reaction. I'm assuming that they have some intelligence - you know, an average-ish IQ somewhere around 100 - and at least some common sense. They did, after all, manage to become bosses.

Personally, I think obsessing about that word is absurd political correctness in the first place. No word is offensive in itself - but *all* words can be used in offensive ways. Prohibit one set of words and people just find other ways to be offensive. If you make the actual attitudes socially unacceptable, you've started to make a real difference, but banning words is just pointless wasted effort.

In this case, though, OK - the bosses are following a policy. The cowardice is that the bosses are unwilling to allow the DJ apologize for a genuine mistake then get on with being a DJ. There was no intent to use that word - it was an innocent mistake, the ""first of its kind I made in my 32 years of broadcasting"", it was admitted as soon as it was pointed out, and the DJ was willing to make a public apology. Yet the bosses are unwilling to accept that - they're over-reacting, pushing him into resigning instead.

You see the BBC has certainly allowed people to apologize for innocent (and not-so-innocent) mistakes. I already mentioned Clarkson before, and he's an obvious example.

Admittedly the DJ offered the either-or choice of apologizing or resigning, and it's not clear whether he was already being pushed at that point, but even so - an apology should be enough. And even the need for that is IMO debatable.

Of course you may note that I've avoided using the N-word myself here, even in order to discuss the issue. You can call that cowardice if you wish, given the point I've been making - it's true, after all.

Even using the word to make argue a point like this, with no racist intent whatsoever, can get you accused of being a racist. I've been attacked as a racist in the past because I dared speak against a racist attitude, and it was just so easy to shout ""HE JUST SAID..."" and get a crowd reaction.

&gt;**Ahmet Arslan and Others v. Turkey 
23 February 2010**

&gt;The applicants, 127 members of a religious group known as Aczimendi tarikatÃ¿, **complained of their conviction in 1997** for a breach of the law on the wearing of headgear and of the rules on wearing religious garments in public, after having toured the streets and appeared at a court hearing wearing the distinctive dress of their group (made up of a turban, baggy trousers a tunic and a stick). Relying on Article 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion)1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, they complained before the European Court of Human Rights that they had been convicted under criminal law for manifesting their religion through their clothing. The European Court of Human Rights found a violation of Article 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion) of the European Convention on Human Rights, holding in particular that **there was no evidence that the applicants had represented a threat to the public order** or that they had been involved in proselytism by exerting inappropriate pressure on passers-by during their gathering. The Court emphasised that in contrast to other cases, **the case concerned punishment for the wearing of particular dress in public areas that were open to all, and not regulation of the wearing of religious symbols in public establishments**, where religious neutrality might take precedence over the right to manifest oneâs religion (see infra). 

In this case, a group of religious people were convicted for wearing a turban on the streets of Turkey. This was overturned by the ECHR on freedom of religion grounds but this has no relevance to the example (which we're discussing) about the wearing of a niqab in a bank or other establishment.

If you actually bothered to read the ruling properly, the ECHR state the government is well within its rights to restrict religious garments in institutions (including public ones) but this particular example refers to the Turkish government prosecuting people for wearing religious headgear *on the street* which violates article 9.",0,1399814596,null,0,false,0,chf50jt,t3_2578p8,t1_chf50jt,t1_chf4u83,null,1433747432,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

He needed to go out and explain that the Lib Dems wanted *x*, the Tories wanted *z*, and we ended up with *y*, which is closer to *z* than we'd like, but with more Lib Dem MPs, they'd bring it closer to *x*.

He didn't do that. He never did any of that. Clegg immediately leapt to the defense of the coalition and painted its every action as ideal, rather than a series of unhappy compromises. And as a result, the Lib Dems are seen as traitors, liars, cheats and all the rest of it.

Birmingham airport might be better in some ways for the whole of the UK (though Manchester is already bigger isn't it?), so fair enough to expand and improve it  but I don't see how it's anything like a replacement for an airport to serve London. A city the size of London should have an airport with sufficient routes to act as a major hub and there is massive business demand in London. Would there be sufficient demand in Birmingham? Can't be many airlines that would want to move without artificial capacity pressures in London, and Birmingham has plenty of spare capacity as it is doesn't it?

&gt;considering it would take roughly the same amount of time to get to London?

HS2 is supposed to be 50mins to Birmingham.

They're both amazing actors and I'd be hard pressed to say which is better at his craft.    I'd say Sir Anthony owns his roles, while Cox inhabits them.  Case in point- look at Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs and you see Hopkins give an extraordinarily creepy performance as Hannibal, then look at Brian Cox in X2 as Col. William Stryker and it's [imo] as if he vanishes, leaving only the character. The scene in X2 when Stryker tells Professor Xavier how his son Jason drove his wife mad to the point that she committed suicide via power drill to the temple is *chilling* and easily every bit as good a scene as Hannibal's conversations with Agent Starling in SotL.

I wanted time to weigh up their deal so found out what they had to offer and asked them to call me back in a couple of days, they were happy to do this and I found that there wasn't much in it when I compared their offering with other provider's tariffs so was ok to stay with them. in short, find out what they can offer you then go and do the sums and see what suits you the best..",0,1399816426,null,0,1399817035,0,chf5hrn,t3_259zek,t1_chf5hrn,t3_259zek,null,1433747658,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,religionisanger,null,null,"I've always been told having a minimum of 3 months worth of salary in a current account is a wise idea (I put this fairly low on my priority list when compared to general savings). Although I'm sure this 3 months thing comes from somewhere (perhaps the average time it takes to get a new job or something). It may be a government recommendation, I have a vague memory of reading it on the BBC or something.

75% of the cash I have each month goes 50/50 into a cash ISA ([nationwide save to buy](http://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/savings/save-to-buy/features-and-benefits) paid 2% for 2 years) and stocks and shares ISA ([hargreaves lansdown](http://www.hl.co.uk/investment-services/isa)). I have no dept, however if I did; like the chart you've got suggests, I'd pay off high interest ones first (avoiding short term letting agencies at all costs). The remainder of the cash I use for living, fun - etc. This stays in my current account and will always do so, my current account is never for saving beyond the three months thing as the interest rate is crap (santander offer good interest rates for new current accounts). At this rate, with Â£0 in my account it would take a year to build up a 3 months salary protection thing (25%x4x3).

As the UK has [forced pension/retirement schemes](https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions-employers) now, I suspect I, along with most people pay small amounts into a pension each month. As I've worked for multiple companies, I have a couple of pensions now - this is a BAD idea as they charge an annual admin fee, the best thing to do is have one (sadly the best may not always be the one your current employer is using, requesting payments to an external pension fund will cut employee pension contributions). I'll increase my pension contributions as I get closer to retirement age/have paid off my mortgage. At present I'm paying in the minimum and consider this part of my wage, I have zero access to this unless I claim it's for a SIPP (self invested personal pension). I'd avoid a SIPP as it prevents/limits employee contributions. I have no idea how much, but sticking with what my employer recommends has always seemed like the best option. 

I'm saving towards a house at the moment, once I own one I'll pay off the mortgage ASAP (and discontinue my saving till that point). I pay the maximum I possibly can each year into ISA's and avoid any other savings accounts (this last year was fairly well calculated). My shares ISAs have been significantly more profitable for the past 2 years. I have a very risky plan to invest lots into shares and live off the dividend, although this may take some time and may not be practical (or something I follow through with). My shares currently pay DRIP (dividend reinvestment plan).

true,pcjonathan,smith,Smith,"I like it and I use it although I'm not particularly obsessed with it. This is mostly because I like the idea of every fandom having a nickname and it saves me from saying/typing the full thing each time (but mostly because it sounds cooler). I don't associate it with any particular area of the fandom, but rather the fandom as a whole (which is, after all, what it is). Of course, as a Brit, this may be far easier to do when there are other places too.

Personally, I don't see what the major issue with the word is that people keep moaning about. Associate it with tumblr? Well, that's your own doing and problem. It shouldn't be everyone else's. Don't like using it? No one is forcing you to use it or not use it. Use ""Doctor Who Fans"". Do so as you will.

I don't see a better word coming along any time soon though. Certainly not that ""dweeb"" crap a while ago, which I do associate with tumblr because that's the only place I've seen it (except for when someone made an attempt to bring it to reddit and was quickly squashed). Now THAT simply sounds ridiculous.

It's popular, widely used and widely known (hell, it's even in the dictionary) and keeping in mind that this is just the latest in the fairly long line of 'Whovian' threads, its kinda like most things IMHO: You don't have to use it. You don't have to like it. But we don't want to constantly hear hatred of it.

They deserve it, Gerrard deserves it, they worked so hard all season, blah blah blah.

Nobody deserves a fucking title, you dig deep and work for it all season. I'd rather have City win purely to shut up all the fucking neutrals and loser fans who threw their weight behind the Scouse. I'd rather have City win without breaking one of the club's league records, but my desire to see Liverpool end the season empty handed because Gerrard fell over in front of the Kop is much higher.

Foods generally last longer than stated once opened. Beans, for example, would last *at least* a week after opening due to the preservatives. 

The only things I wouldn't advise  using after the '3 day rule' is seafood as that is dodgy enough for people with experience to judge whether it's safe.

Some folk waste a hell of a lot of perfectly good food just because the label it's too be used within a certain time. 

You can tell if something is safe to eat just by look/smell/touch.

I know there's a few new Liverpool fans on here and many overseas fans to, but let's do this right.

In the circumstances ""I am [an] English [citizen]"" seems impossible to argue with, ""I am English"" seems difficult to agree with.

&gt; Am I a ""poser"" for supporting Chester F.C. or Liverpool F.C.?

No, loads of people support foreign sports teams.  Like simoncowbell said just spare the cringey overcompensatory stuff about how if you cut you you'll bleed Chester FC, as often seen on /r/soccer :P

&gt; What do you recommend I do to get in touch with this part of my heritage?  Other than watching Top Gear, Kitchen Nightmares and Monty Python...

Well if you want more TV shows... maybe try Shameless or Phoenix Nights?  Entertaining/funny and rooted in NW England culture.  They're much more Manc/Lancashire than Cheshire/Merseyside but I can't think of anything based in Chester except Hollyoaks, which is shit.

&gt;  Is there anything I really need to see in Western England?

Well, here's a quick lesson in English culture: there isn't really any such place as Western England.  

People in the West from Liverpool-ish upwards would identify as North West.  People from Bristol-ish downwards would identify as South West.  People in between would think of their area as West Midlands or (Welsh) Borders.

The interview itself is designed to assess your problem solving. There's the cursory 5min look through your personal statement to make you feel comfortable, then they'll ask you maths questions for the rest of the time. They'll start with something easy then it gets harder until they find something you don't know.

Currently I work for Halifax and the Junior ISA that we offer is probably the best on the market. If you hold an ISA yourself with us, which only has to be Â£1 in value. You can get a 6 % Junior ISA for your kid. Not accessible till age of 18 though which you're already aware of. It's a variable rate however, so can go up / down. It's been pretty consistent over the past few years however, and generally kids savings are better than adult savings. IIRC current allowance is 3840 for them (Can't remember off the top of my head too many figures haha) there is also Junior stocks and shares if you feel like being a bit riskier? We also have a young saver account paying 3 percent, variable, up to 20K.

To stick with the same time period, before the Nazis shot them all, the KPD attempted armed insurrection in Germany several times. Another example: Anti-racism laws in the UK are arguably examples of a liberal state silencing certain types of politics.

&gt;Whilst not wanting to Godwin the thread, using physical violence to silence the politics of those that you don't agree with is literally Nazi Germany, except the real irony is that the allegation is that it's the anti-fascists that are accused of using physical violence.

The use of violence by anti-fascists against fascist parties dates back in the UK to cable street, and in the post-war era the [43 group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/43_Group) and [anti-nazi league](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti_Nazi_League). The later did involve labour figures such as Peter Hain, but that was a different time, in which one anti-fascist was killed on the street by fascist-sympathising riot police.

The problem for UAF is using those tactics against, say, the NF has a rationale, albeit a far-left one. Using violence or no platform against UKIP is stupid: it isn't a fascist party but a populist right one.

* Torres and Mikel hopefully will leave the club, neither lived up to expectation when they first joined us and there are many upgrades available.
* Schurrle was great
* Oscar needs to improve if he wants to play in the CAM spot
* Salah was dreadful, hard to see him having an amazing year next season. He would need to improve *a lot* over the summer, which can't happen
* Kalas looked great, if anyone could get a gif of that brilliant flick he did over the offensive player in the second half that would be great.

The justification for anti-fascist violence has always been based on precisely that though: when faced with a political force that organises along those militarised anti-democratic lines *and* is tolerated by the state (and even supported by the police), the only response possible is to fight back. That was certainly the case for the 43 group and the ANL, or more recently Greek anti-fascists.

UAF has a strange relationship to violence: they do not call for or endorse it officially, but block an EDL demonstration and it's only really going to go one way. Many would disagree but I consider that justified in many cases.

Against UKIP it is nonsensical.

I just hope we see him lift that trophy. I really really do, Its like an inadverted life goal for me to see it. 

To the replies Below-

I personally take everything Gerrard has done, you cant understand the good in Gerrard until you see the bad. 

Steven Gerrard is a shining example of a man who has made mistakes, but so have I, and I imagine a lot of people who grew up like me in the UK with gang culture, and drugs round every corner, but he gets over the mistakes he did make and he leads not by anger, force or aggression, but by being an example, He knows he is a gifted footballer and yet he is never a show off, never flashy or arrogant, he cares about his roots but performs to the best to make sure his talent is not wasted, and if anyone thinks his heart is not in it, they need only look at his emotions this season, he Leads by example, he is a warrior.

He is no saint, and you would be a fool to ignore the fact he was going to leave the club, but he is an Idol, and he is my Idol, because he optimises that of an Everyman, a man who grows up making mistakes, and perhaps will never be perfect, but I do not think he is proud of them, I think he is a genuinely decent person, and I love him. And above all else, his is a sublime footballer who has done a lot for this club, No he has not won a Premier League title yet, but what he has brought and still brings to this club is worth more than any silverware for me, because he is the reason football is so special, characters like him make football for me, people you can believe in, trust and vye for, to get behind in the never ending soap opera that is witnessed at anfield 

So it is for that reason that Steven Gerrard is, and always Will be a Legend to me and Tens of Thousands of Fans of this club. 

But I have never been to Liverpool, So I probably dont know what I am talking about, as I am just a half fan. :).

Several questions ""are you living paycheck to paycheck"" can be quickly skipped over for one answer, but would need to split off and loop back for the opposite. Similarly, ""how far off is the thing you're saving for"" can split off into ""&lt;3 years -&gt; save"" and ""&gt;10 years -&gt; invest"" with 3-10 years having more questions to guide towards the best answer for the situation.

I would recommend ~~an off-site temporary wiki non-mods could~~ a new wiki page laid out as a flowchart, which we add to as and when questions come up in this sub or have spare time. ~~Once it got to answer, say 30% of new posts, a copy could be posted on the main sub wiki, while the off-site continued to be improved.~~ This would be really useful for me as I don't much opportunity in RL to hash things out with people who know as much about finance as I do, so there might be something I currently consider ""obvious"" that really isn't.

If your girlfriend is willing to let you live with her/get a place together (and I feel like she should at the very least let you crash for a while if you're moving all the way from Cambridge to be with her) then there's even less to worry about. Especially if you're willing to take any job at first just to get settled. Just come down and get job hunting! 

As far as starting the ""process"" there are so many generic sites for property and jobs. Just hit google.

true,Ms_moonlight,null,null,"Although you have plenty of excellent answers, I thought I'd add in a few based on personal experience as an immigrant (with a new UK passport). 

&gt;Do you normally just do the conversion in the UK and take money with you, or can you not just take your debit or credit card and use that abroad when you need to access money?

As someone else said, you can do either. What you do will depend on where you go. Some countries rely a lot on cash (Japan for certain) and there are some countries where people use credit/debit cards for everything (the US). 

&gt;Also how do visas work? Do you need one even if you are only visiting a country for a few days?

This depends on the country, wiki travel has some good advice about this.

&gt;Also, do you need to go for an interview to get a passport? 

Yes! I went for the interview in December 2012. There were about ten of us that day and only one natural born Brit getting her first passport. You take some ID. There's also a check service at the post office so they can check it for you and send it off. Warning in advance: you'll need to find some references for your passport, and they usually have to be in specific careers (work at a bank/post office/GP/etc.) 

&gt;Also, how do you usually buy the tickets for your plane? Do you buy return tickets at the same time? 

I usually do flight + hotel + return flight at the same time. It's better to buy a return -- occasionally you get harassed if you don't. Countries have to defend their borders and really want specifics about how long you're going to stay there if you don't have a return ticket.  

&gt;citizenship test being implemented where you get asked a bunch of silly questions about the UK when you are getting a passport. Did anyone here have to do that?

I took this in 2009 although I can't remember the month specifically. There are a dozen or so book on the market for this and I spent some time studying (my co-workers were very amused and helped me) and passed on the first try.

Okay, first, Edinburgh is a great city even if you don't drive.  
Secondly, if you decide to move up here (you should, it's great) make sure you are moving up here for you and not because you hope to fix anything in a relationship.  If your girlfriend is swithering about this, it might be for a serious and boring reason, and big stresses don't fix relationships. 

/r/relationships/ might be somewhere you could look for advice.  

As for moving up here, at the most basic level you would need to put together a deposit for a flat, a couple months rent in advance that sort of thing.  
ESPC.co.uk is a local site that has some flats for rent, gumtree sometimes has some. Have a look, make some plans, think about it  It has been a while, so hopefully others can provide better resources.  The jobs market isn't terrible up here, not great, not terrible, but there are jobs. 

I will just comment on your user name, 20 years old and working full time are not the actions of a loser, being proactive and learning to drive are not the actions of a loser, making plans for your future are not the actions of a loser (I know it was a throwaway, and might have been a joke, but you never know).

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; So would all Scots still be considered British citizens or would they become Scottish citizens?

The table at the bottom of [this page](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2013/11/9348/11) (from the White Paper) outlines what would happen:

* British citizen habitually resident in Scotland on day one of independence: automatically a Scottish citizen.
* British citizens born in Scotland but living outside of Scotland on day one of independence: automatically a Scottish citizen.
* Child born in Scotland to at least one parent who has Scottish citizenship or indefinite leave to remain at the time of their birth: automatically a Scottish citizen.
* Child born outside Scotland to at least one parent who has Scottish citizenship: automatically a Scottish citizen (if birth registered in Scotland).
* British national living outside Scotland with at least one parent who qualifies for Scottish citizenship: can register for Scottish citizenship.
Citizens of any country, who have a parent or grandparent who qualifies for Scottish citizenship: can register for Scottish citizenship.
* Migrants in Scotland legally: can apply for Scottish citizenship.
* Citizens of any country who have spent at least ten years living in Scotland at any time and have an ongoing connection with Scotland: can apply for Scottish citizenship.

&gt; Would everyone get automatic duel citizenship?

Essentially, yes: both Scottish and UK governments allow dual citizenship. You can gain a new citizenship without losing your existing citizenship.

It is [theoretically possible](http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/scottish-independence-uk-passport-loss-indication-1-2961819) that the UK may prohibit individuals from holding both Scottish and UK citizenship. However this would make Scotland the only country in the world that the UK did not allow dual citizenship with, so to my mind it seems a little far-fetched.

&gt; What would happen with visas etc assuming Scotland is outside of the EU when it first gains independence?

Scotland would not leave the EU until the process of becoming a full member was settled.

Temporarily removing Scotland from the EU would be of no benefit and some cost to Scotland, rUK, or the EU. So, IMO, it's overwhelmingly likely that Scotland would leave the UK and join the EU on the same date (and if joining the EU takes a little longer than seems likely, independence also takes a little longer).

&gt; Is there a plan for how all this would be implemented or is it still been decided?

The exact ""this is what will happen"" depends on several things - what happens during negotiations with the UK government, and who is in power in Scotland after the 2016 Holyrood elections.

If you assume that the SNP will win that election then the [White Paper](http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2013/11/9348/0) is a good starting point for what's probably going to happen. What actually happens will be slightly different, I'm sure, but that is essentially the SNP's plan.",0,1399831783,null,0,false,0,chfawxm,t3_25ah65,t1_chfawxm,t1_chf9yms,null,1433750278,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Regardless, this sort of logic is moot. Does it matter how many sponge puddings the soldiers in Afghanistan have eaten? Perhaps it matters how many tins of diet coke there were on the Boeing 767 that cruised into the world trade center?

The volume and cost of munitions dropped on afghanistan and iraq are pretty moot. The bottom line is they *were* dropped, and you either agree with that or you don't. The cost and volume is by the by.

If you wanted to make a genuine analysis you'd also have to ask the MoD what volume of munitions they would expect that number of soldiers to expend in training over that 13 year period. Furthermore, how many of those munitions would have just expired if they hadn't been used (some types of munition have a *""use by date""*), and how many of those munitions were purchased specifically for Iraq and Afghanistan. You'd also have to find out - when Coalition forces use munitions in support of other nations, who pays for them? i.e. does a US J-DAM airstrike called in by British groundforces get paid for by the MoD or do US forces bear the cost - I suspect the US covers it, as we would cover it in the reverse situation. 

Anyway, my point is - what the OP is after is an unscientific ""Shock-horror"" number. Well I'll give you a number. 5,983,500. It's quite a big number?

Change to 4-3-3 with a powerhouse midfield and wingers WITHOUT massive defensive responsibility in normal games against the likes of Stoke. Seeing Hazard track back to our own byline is brilliant at keeping clean sheets in huge games but he's really more effective elsewhere.

Sign Diego Costa, tell him not to be a massive cunt and watch him tear up the league with Hazard and another of our wingers in attacking roles.

Sign Edin Dzeko or Mario Mandzukic to rotate with and push Costa to the max, and train the players in how to play 4-4-2 properly when necessary. There's probably a reason that the top two this season play with 2 strikers.

Sign that Wolfsburg LB (Rodriguez?) so Azpi can play on the right.

Break the bank for one of Juventus' midfielders (ideally Pogba) and someone else like Rakitic so that we can just steamroll teams in the middle of the park and spray balls up to Costa and into space for Hazard and co.

The English language is full of problems like the one presented by **there**, **their** and **they're**. Most native English speakers pronounce these the same way; therefore, it is difficult for some to judge from your face which spelling you meant. Each spelling means a very different thing; if you'd like to learn the difference, read on! 

 * Use **there** when referring to a place, whether concrete (""over there by the building"") or more abstract (""it must be difficult to live there""). 

 * Also use **there** with the verb ""be"" (is, am, are, was, were) to indicate the existence of something, or to mention something for the first time. 

 * Use **their** to indicate possession. It is a possessive adjective and indicates that a particular noun belongs to them.(""Their children went to school together"") 

 * Remember that **they're** is a contraction of the words **they** and **are**. It can never be used as a modifier, only as a subject (who or what does the action) and verb (the action itself). (""Hurry up! **They're** closing the mall at six tonight!"").

I don't think there is a cut-off date?

Adding citizenship doesn't take away your existing citizenship, so as I understand it Scotland will simply offer Scottish citizenship to those people who qualify automatically/apply.

If their other country prohibits dual citizenship then they would need to choose if they want to decline the Scottish citizenship or cancel their existing citizenship.

true,olibentley,null,null,"Ok, lots of questions...

Firstly, I am a fourth year physics undergrad. Physics undergrads typically do a four-year MPhys course, not a BA. As the fourth year would otherwise be a postgraduate masters course, we get treated like postgrads. This puts me in the confusing position of being a member of the MCR and JCR (Junior Common Room, undergrads).

I am the President of the Jesus College Boat Club, which is why I was so keen on it in my earlier response. ([Check us out!](http://jcbc.jesus.ox.ac.uk/)) I'm also a member of the whiskey tasting society, which isn't a big time commitment. 

All postgrads are automatically enrolled in the MCR, so you will be a member. Membership is very cheap (possibly free, I can't remember). It is up to you to decide how much time you spend there. I would recommend you do go to MCR events as this will be the primary way you meet other members of college. See the [MCR website.](http://mcr.jesus.ox.ac.uk/)

Similarly, you are also automatically enrolled in OUSU (for free). OUSU doesn't have a big presence in Oxford, as every college has JCRs and MCRs which fulfil the union roll, on a college basis. I wouldn't be worried about OUSU. 

For grants, as I am still technically an undergrad I can't be certain for your case, but I have heard about book grants and conference grants in the past. I don't think you need to worry about these now. The forms I have used to apply for grants in the past have all been from internal-college sources (intranet and emailing the academic office).

Accommodation during the holidays: As a postgrad, you will not be expected to move out during holidays. Your lease will be decided on a yearly basis and you will be able to stay the whole year (if you want) before renewing it. First year **under**grads do have to move out every holiday, and their rooms are used for conferences (and interviews for next year), but you won't have to worry about this. One postgrad I know stayed in the same flat for three years straight.

I think that is everything. I don't think you need to worry about anything until the college gets in touch with you.

Do you still think his posts here are downvoted because of his republicanism?

The guy is widely disliked here because he lives in London yet makes comments like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/23y28i/an_orangemans_comments_on_his_losing_faith_in_the/ch1ura8?context=3) about NI. 

And look at [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/23o9zj/michael_smiley_cycles_around_norn_iron_in_this/ch1latx?context=3) the downvotes he gets here aren't because he's voicing Irish Republican views, but because he's shoehorning them into a thread about a documentary on cycling.

I've seen him make comments in /r/unitedkingdom about wishing to see the UK become a republic, I agree with him on that yet I still think [he's a knob](http://www.reddit.com/r/britpics/comments/250z1r/was_holidaying_at_center_parcs_in_the_lake/chcvb0p?context=3).",0,1399834865,null,0,false,0,chfc43o,t3_259kp0,t1_chfc43o,t1_chfbsfc,null,1433750844,4,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,4

Priority one has to be keeping the current squad together so we can build on it, which I really don't think we'll have any trouble with. The players getting linked with moves away seem like the sorts who know they're part of something good right now and have very little reason to leave. If we can find a replacement for Lukaku (preferably a permanent signing), we'll be on to something good next year. Generally I think we need two more players in each of the defence, midfield, up front so we can cope with the inevitably injury crises that will come up, particularly with European competition to contend with.

I, for one, could not have asked for a better performance. Finishing second and establishing ourselves as a genuinely scary team to play has been a true joy for me. As an oldie, I can remember when we were last so consistently dominant, it was the last time we won the league. We were a bit spoiled by getting so close to winning and we're allowed to feel a bit disappointed that we couldn't close it out. Once that settles, we have to see that we've gone from a being ""above average"" to title contenders on merit. You can believe this, we are not in a false position, there was no fluke, no flash in the pan. 

Next season depends on signings for us. But that's true for everyone except City. If we make the smartest acquisitions during the summer, we'll have a superb chance of going one better next season.

I also want to add, part of why this season has been so enjoyable has been this community. Thanks to the mods and the regular contributors. Things like the matchday probabilities and post match ratings have kept me as hooked on this sub as I have been on the pitch.

&gt;As I made clear to the honourable gentlemen who asked the question [Mr McCann], decisions on UK citizenship remain with the UK government, but if the vote in the referendum is for a separatist vote then Scotland will become a separate state â it will not be part of the UK.

The implication seems to be that while dual citizenship is not prohibited it wouldn't be automatic and there is the possibility that during the separation people may be required to decide which nationality they wish to retain. 

I mean in the long term it doesn't really make sense for every person in Scotland to automatically have British citizenship if its a separate country, granted there needs to be a transition period where people can decide which country they want to be a part of but this would only be temporary wouldn't it?

But them I'm old &amp; bitter. I am happy that Liverpool are champions of the clubs who get by on their income, rather than the exorbitant spending of a sugar daddy. Sure, Liverpool have negative net spending recently, but have no debts that their income can't service. Chelsea &amp; City would be been wound up &amp; sold off piecemeal if their deficit spending had to be covered by their income.

true,notsoyoungpadawan,null,null,"Lol.. Because RES determines facts and not opinions or shoddy reddiqutte, right?

&gt;Matic is a good passer but he shouldn't expected to be the one making the incisive through balls. 

And why the hell not? Xavi does it for Barca. Schweinstiger does it for Bayern. Modric does it for Madrid. 

&gt;Hazard and Matic play different positions so comparing them is pretty meaningless, but when looking at a just passing ability Hazard is the better one, short, long, through, crossing all of them. I would love to know why you disagree.

You are bloody insane and I shall now prove it. 

Firstly, it was you who claimed Hazard is the best passer in the ENTIRE team, so don't even start with the ""different positions"" bullcrap.

Secondly, I have no idea where you have conjured up this idea from that Hazard is a better short and long passer than Matic. I seriously DO NOT know. Sounds like one of your usual delusions.

As for something to back my opinion up, here are some stats from squawka:

Hazard passing accuracy - 83%.

Hazard average passing length - 14m.

Matic passing accuracy - 84%.

Matic average passing length - 19m.

Matic's forward passes are also 4m longer on average than Hazard's. Also remember that Matic has played less than half the number of games Hazard has played, and only has 3 less assists than Hazard. You take his 16 games to 34 and he would've easily had 8 (double his current 4) or more assists.",0,1399837017,null,0,false,0,chfcyol,t3_258dkt,t1_chfcyol,t1_chewrh2,null,1433751244,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

1. Does anyone have experience with employers in the US? I'm fairly sure I want to go back to the United States at some point after college.

2. On drinking societiesâthe TSR thread said they're basically groups of students who like going out and are ""associated with posh people."" Is this similar to the way frats/various clubs in US ~~colleges~~ unis are connected to alumni who help them get jobs?

3. In the United States, it's terribly difficult to get a corporate internship before your third (out of four) years of university. How does this work in the UK? Do the internships start opening up after your second year, or third year, or first year...?

Thanks again! I'm really excited to start this fall :)

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; The implication seems to be that while dual citizenship is not prohibited it wouldn't be automatic and there is the possibility that during the separation people may be required to decide which nationality they wish to retain.

That's probably what she was hoping to imply, but she's not actually saying anything beyond the obvious - the UK makes decisions for the UK and if Scotland leaves the UK then Scotland makes decisions for Scotland.

Dual citizenship is ""automatic"" in the sense that you don't need to do anything to make it happen. It would continue to be automatic unless the UK introduced some new law which singled out Scotland and said it wasn't allowed with this country.

It's true, that could happen. It's also true that it would be entirely up to the UK if they wanted to do that.

It seems a bit far-fetched to me, but stranger ideas [have been floated](http://www.heraldscotland.com/politics/political-news/english-would-bomb-our-airports.17005697).

&gt; I mean in the long term it doesn't really make sense for every person in Scotland to automatically have British citizenship if its a separate country, granted there needs to be a transition period where people can decide which country they want to be a part of but this would only be temporary wouldn't it?

Once Scotland was a separate country then new people born in Scotland wouldn't automatically have British citizenship.

There would probably be some kind of parent/child system in both Scotland and rUK where you get citizenship based on place of birth/parents/etc, but ultimately two separate countries would emerge.

Dual citizenship would be a temporary phenomenon, affecting the people alive right now and maybe their immediate descendants.

If you fast-forwarded 5-6 generations then most of the people living in Scotland would (only) have Scottish citizenship and most of the people living in the UK would (only) have UK citizenship.

If Scotland and rUK both continued to have a ""we've no problem with dual citizenship"" policy then those people could easily apply for one from the other, just like they could apply to any other country who allowed dual citizenship.",0,1399837184,null,0,false,0,chfd150,t3_25ah65,t1_chfd150,t1_chfcjnu,null,1433751278,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Played some great football and of course being saints fans we have had some blunders and heart in mouth moments (cough Boruc cough- still think he's a quality keeper though) but i think we thoroughly deserve the title ""best of the rest"". Whether we can keep the core of this squad and become regular top half finishers with the hope of Europe, I don't know. Can't see the investment being put in tbh.
I am so glad that we got rid of osvaldo after his clash with fonte, our squad is built on togetherness and without the respect, osvaldo is never going to fit. 
Can't wait to see more young players through next season and begin to cement their starting 11 places.
Whatever happens over the summer I will still be a proud saints fan and not hold any grudges towards players or the manager if they choose to leave, they have all served us well and done a job. Let's hope tomorrow hodgson will pick all 3 of our guys and that they represent southampton well (I'm thinking a lambert penalty in a shoot out to win it may be sufficient?)

Having a porous border makes it very very hard to encourage assimilation of minority groups. There's little requirement or impetus for a new arrival to feel a sense of loyalty to the country. Now this isn't just an EU thing, it's the way a lot of countries are heading due to Globalisation.

It's ok if they're doing it as part of a comedy routine, because they're encouraging you to laugh at them. That's why Mrs Brown's Boys is rated so highly; drag is a long-established element of British comedy.

But when anyone not conforming to normal gender roles appears in a non-comedic context, there's a backlash. The audience is being told, implicitly, ""you can't laugh at them"" - they're actually presenting themselves (or their characters) as not conforming to society's ""rules"" as regards to gender. Without the comedic context, the audience has no idea how to react - the basic ""we don't like what we don't understand"" principle comes into play.

And so, because Conchita appeared as a serious musical artist last night at Eurovision rather than as a comedy drag act, she's been met with antipathy, derision and even hatred.

Just thinking out loud, but in part, that could be an attempt to try and reduce the likelihood of copycat activities. The fact that BF are said to have emerged from NI sectarian organisations also adds an element of shadyness that would possibly attract the attention of those who do things like slap D notices on things.

I wouldn't assume, as you seem to be hinting, that it's an attempt to try and pretend that white christians wouldn't do this kind of thing. Apologies if I'm making incorrect assumptions about your thinking on these lines.

No matter what, it was obviously an attempt at provocative confrontation designed to generate media attention on the part of BF, and it's worked to some extent. I was only dimly aware of them as an organisation before this. I do not like the sound of them one bit. Hopefully those responsible for this are a small bunch of numpties trying to show off, and it's not going to become any more widespread.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt;Well yeah, becoming a EU member state takes bloody ages.

The vast majority of time is spent harmonising national legislation with EU law. That's difficult to do overnight, since legal systems often have lots of history behind them, however that process has already been done for Scotland (as part of the UK).

&gt;I think im right in saying that Scotland wil not be given any favours in becoming a member and Spain will even veto the action.

[That's incorrect](https://sites.google.com/site/gironaindependencia/2014-0203-1):

&gt;JosÃ©-Manuel GarcÃ­a-Margallo, foreign minister, told the Financial Times: âIf Scotland becomes independent in accordance with the legal and institutional procedures, it will ask for admission [to the EU]. If that process has indeed been legal, that request can be considered. If not, then not,â he said.
&gt;
&gt;While he refused to comment directly on whether Spain might veto Scottish accession to the EU after an independence vote, he insisted the cases of Scotland and Catalonia were âfundamentally differentâ. Madrid would continue to resist a Catalan plan to hold its own referendum on independence less than two months after the Scottish vote in September, he said.
&gt;
&gt;Asked about the independence campaign, Spainâs foreign minister said: âWe donât interfere in other countriesâ internal affairs. If Britainâs constitutional order allows â and it seems that it does allow â Scotland to choose independence, we have nothing to say about this.â

Spain is frequently mentioned due to their issues with Catalonia. However their problem there is that the Spanish constitution prohibits unilateral secession from Spain, not that they have some fundamental objection to any two countries going their separate ways.
