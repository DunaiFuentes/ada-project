From talking to job seekers, there're also a shitload of other hoops they're made to jump through such as 40 required job searches on Universal Job Match per week.

Whether or not that last one is new I don't know, but either way it just seems to create a culture of numbing box ticking to get the weekly allowance, rather than support smart, efficient job search techniques.

That's just three examples of a discussion Marx and what Marx is - and how the ideas of Marx himself are constructed.

Here's a really good book on the way Marx the man is interpreted:

http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZdGy25z1sUAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Marx++the+man&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yZdzU9j2BKet7QartIG4Ag&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Marx%20%20the%20man&amp;f=false

&gt; Defining Islam as the religion practised by actual muslims is entirely legitimate. It is accepted by most people and particularly those Hitchens communicates with, which is the entire fucking purpose of language!

Well now, language is a tool of the social construction of reality , here's Berger and Luckman's seminal work on that. 

http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kNjH2u4r9VYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT5&amp;dq=social+construction&amp;ots=pCXzaIitK9&amp;sig=TcFM0BsO7TSC_lOPLm486feX954#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20construction&amp;f=false

It boils down to the fact that to understand  social phenomena one must being to understand what the structural nature of it is and be able to understand where it all came from. I'm not going to quote it in full but the relevant page you're looking for is around page 10 to 15.

&gt;&gt;You can ask a Egyptian about ""Secularism"" and it means something wildly different to someone from the US. Context, my child, context.

&gt;&gt;Nothing in this debate is even remotely as complicated as a concept like secularism. Nothing. You kept misunderstanding simple English sentences and then you got upset and started derailing the discussion to somewhere else in a pathetic attempt to massage your bruised ego.

And that's where you make a critical mistake. When you give people a concept they describe it to you - let's take the surveys - if you say to an Egyptian ""Should Egypt be secular"" - the response is going to be influenced by what that person has experienced and what that person knows. To that Egyptian secularism may mean the Arab Nationalism of Jemal Abdel Nasser.. or it could mean that everything the Muslim Brotherhood are not.  The same goes for Islam - it's contingent on the social context of the person who you ask. Thus I gave you all those examples - where symbols and ideas are mitigated through a context.

Please, the TTB argument *only* works because it is so unrealistic. It's deliberately designed to manipulate moral judgements and make those listening to it capitulate not only without revulsion at the prospect, but with urgency and relish.

I order to support the 'Dirty Harry' scenario a number of concessions have to be made which are contradictory to its overall purpose or have diminishing returns:

- The torturer would be an illegal agent and not institutionalised, yet would have to be institutionalised in order to carry out torture. Unless you believe that a random person off the street would be expected to pick up thumbscrews, electrodes and a DIY-waterboarding kit.

- The information people will give to stop torture is notoriously unreliable; torture could marginally expedite the process over a number of years (see the KSM 'enhanced interrogation' reports where interrogators had to sift through numerous false testimonies), but in no way does this make a compelling argument for extracting an urgent testimony. Once again, this falls into the slippery slope argument you noted; once you feel like you're not getting results fast enough and you still classify your actions as 'exceptionalist' then *what will you not do in order to get results*(?)

Soon, you would have the new airport at 80% capacity (more than the 50% that Heathrow provided in equivalence to the new place) and the skies would be even more full.

These days a lot of aircraft are slowed down en route so that they arrive roughly on time - the target for Heathrow at the moment is to land 95% of planes without waiting, and most days ATC is over that target. But that still doesn't matter really because there is only so much space up there to put a plane into whilst it is lining up to land - planes must be separated by 1000 feet vertically from each other, and by 10 nautical miles horizontally - this is reduced to 5nm around Heathrow because it's so busy.

And the planning arguments that I have voiced here were the ones raised by NATS, the company I worked for and the company that provides the Air Traffic Management for the UK - they are the people who know and this is what they have said.

For example, your link is to ""Marx **the man**""  Another is ""**conceptions** of Marx"".  Do you notice those two other words stringed in there?  Did they teach you to count at university?

&gt;Well now, language is a tool of the social construction of reality , here's Berger and Luckman's seminal work on that.

Are you really this desperate to get away from the actual debate.  What's next?  A discussion on who's going to win the world cup?

&gt;And that's where you make a critical mistake. When you give people a concept they describe it to you - let's take the surveys - if you say to an Egyptian ""Should Egypt be secular"" - the response is going to be influenced by what that person has experienced and what that person knows. To that Egyptian secularism may mean the Arab Nationalism of Jemal Abdel Nasser.. or it could mean that everything the Muslim Brotherhood are not. The same goes for Islam - it's contingent on the social context of the person who you ask. Thus I gave you all those examples - where symbols and ideas are mitigated through a context.

This is wrong.  You're conflating different things here.  Agreeing on a definition is not the same as discussing a topic like ""Should Egypt be secular"".  Neither is ""do muslims think football is a good sport"".

Last year it was 26 from 16, 72 total so 46. Year before after 16 it was 35 from 16, ending on 69 so 34 from 22. 10/11 it was 26 from 16, ending on 62, so 36 points in 22 games. 09/10 it was 27 from 16, ending on 70, so 43. 08/09, after Ramos was sacked it was 18 points from 16, ending on 51, so 33 points from 22.

So:

Sherwood - 42

AVB - 46

Harry - 33, 43, 36, 34 - 36.5 average.

So if we exclude the first 16 games (which Sherwood had no part in), Harry's form after game 16 is far worse than Sherwood's.

* Levy is still pissed at LvG for whoring himself to United and decides to hire Mick McCarthy out of spite
* A large section the supporters go crazy and a riot resulting in WHL and the area around it burning to the ground including the ironworks
* With all the land needed for the stadium now available and the demolition having been completed for free by the supporters Daniel Levy in ""an effort to heal the community"" sacks McCarthy on July 15th, 2014 and appoints LvG and agree to play matches in Wembley while the new stadium is completed.
* Spurs supporters continually sing *""Que Será, Será, whatever will be, will be, we're going to Wembley, Que Será, Será""*, the novelty quickly wears off but it annoys Arsenal supporters to no end so Spurs supporters continue to sing it at every chance.
* Spurs rise in the table and Levy is lauded as the man who healed London
* With the new Stadium now complete ENIC sell to Larry Ellison who promises a £2 billion transfer budget and is promptly told he can't by the FA and UEFA. In response Ellison tries to buy UEFA unsuccessfully.
* Ellison is regarded as the worst thing to happen in the history of English football.
* Spurs supporters do not like the new owner and plan protests with banners in the stands of the new stadium.
* Ellison appoints Ledley King as the new manager. All is forgiven by Spurs supporters who now laud Ellison as the greatest thing to ever come into contact with Spurs.
* Martin Samuel and Neil Ashton call Ellison naming Ledley King the new manager the smartest decision in the history of English football and now refer to Ellison as the best owner in the PL.

So even If I was born here, paid taxes all my life, I have a lower priority to someone because I was unlucky not to have ancestors born here?

true,mr-strange,null,null,"&gt; They are nothing more than the dying gasp of a generation who have nothing more to contribute to modern society.

I certainly hope you are right, but I don't think the polling supports that. True, much of UKIP's support comes from the ""Alf Garnet"" generation that you mention, but much of their recent growth has come from ill-educated, youngish whites - who formerly might have had sympathy for the BNP.

I fear that UKIP *are* fascist, or at least proto-fascist. Today's world is very different from the 30s, so fascism will look very different today. No 1930s-style fascist party would be able to thrive in modern Britain - I submit that UKIP looks very much like what fascism would look like, if it were forced to reinvent itself today:

30s fascism was always accompanied by **violence,** but the state is much more powerful today, and non-state violence has much less legitimacy. There *are* violent groups who have tried to associate themselves with UKIP, but a modern-day *Sturmabteilung* would be electorally toxic, so UKIP are careful to distance themselves.

**Racism** is absolutely core to fascism, but no overtly racist group could hope to reach power in the UK. That's partly thanks to the negative image of 1930s fascism - itself seen as perverse (yet ill-understood) foreign ideology. UKIPs racism is therefore couched in euphemisms and dog-whistles - the purpose of which is *not* to avoid censure from anti-racists, but to *allow their supporters to believe that they are not themselves racist.*

**Authoritarianism and anti-intellectualism** are also key pillars of fascism. They go together to form a synergistic whole: ""do what I say, but don't think about it."" This was exemplified by Hitler's *führerprinzip* - a refusal to have policies or to be constrained by rational argument, or even by what he previously said or did. UKIP are clearly uncomfortable with rational policy discussions. It's clear that Farage takes no part in writing their manifestos, and feels that their contents are unimportant. You can see that clearly in his recent interview with Andrew Neil.

Finally, **corporatism**. Business is much more powerful than it was in the 30s. It's simply not realistic to hope to wield untrammelled state power over corporations. Our membership of the Common Market makes it very difficult for the State to interfere in the business world. 

So the modern world gives them much less freedom of action, but you can see a consistent thread in UKIP's aspirations: They are very keen to free the state from rules or associations that are constraining it. Withdrawing from the EU, and from the ECHR are two of their most prominent policies. UKIP are completely explicit that they believe the State is too constrained by them, but they say very little about what they would *do* with the extra freedom they would procure for the State.

I fear that the removal of these ""shackles"" would allow them to move on to much more overtly fascist policies. With unconstrained control over immigration policy, they would be free to make it much more racist, perhaps eventually to ""send the lot back home"", as Victoria Ayling clearly wishes. With control of the police and without the ECHR, they would be able to begin asserting their authoritarianism more violently. Without the EU's rules, they would start to exert more control over the business world - in the Andrew Neil interview Farage is already expressing his frustration that the UK government cannot intervene in takeover contests such as Astra-Zeneca/Pfizer.

The important battle that we are facing today is to make the case for the value of these constraints on the State. Supranational entities such as the EU and the ECHR are a crucial bulwark against totalitarianism. UKIP want to sweep that away.

&gt;**So even If I was born here, paid taxes all my life, I have a lower priority to someone because I was unlucky not to have ancestors born here?**

You seem to be interpreting this around preconceptions.  Consider it from this perspective: if you find yourself having to use the social safety net for housing then one of the most important things is to retain your own personal support network, especially if you're financially limited.  What we currently have is a system that takes the poorest and moves them out of the area where they have family, friends, and connections, based essentially on their level of poverty.  It breaks up the family network, not just for the younger generations, but also for grandparents with their children having to move away.

They argue that close local family ties is grounds for priority.  Somebody without close links doesn't mean they won't get social housing (something their housing spokesperson argues should be extended), only that if you don't have close links to an area over somebody in a similar position who does - that it's a lesser upheaval for that person to be afforded social housing elsewhere.

Importantly the families this stand to benefit most from this are the disenfranchised minorities in metropolitan estates, which to a large extent have been failed by the system.

&gt;**Also .. doesn't' the UKIP share an alliance with the Danish People's party... haven't they adopted most of these policies?**

Any UKIP affiliate to their EU voting bloc in the parliament,  the EFD, comes under no whip system on the condition they can sign up to  4 principles.   When an EU MEP has broken with these principles UKIP has threatened in the past that if the offender didn't walk, either voluntarily or as part of a bloc vote, then they as a party would.

These 4 principles are:

     1. Freedom and co-operation among people of different States

        Committed to the principles of democracy, freedom and 
        co-operation among Nation States, the Group favours an 
        open, transparent, democratic and accountable co-operation
        among sovereign European States and rejects the
        bureaucratisation of Europe and the creation of a single
        centralised European superstate.

     2. More democracy and respect of People's will

        Convinced that the legitimate level for democracy lies 
        with the Nation States, their regions and parliaments 
        since there is no such thing as a single European people; 
        the Group opposes further European integration (treaties 
        and policies) that would exacerbate the present democratic
        deficit and the centralist political structure of the EU. The
        Group favours that any new treaties or any modification of 
        the existing treaties are to be submitted to the peoples’ 
        vote through free and fair national referenda in the Member
        States. The Group does believe that the legitimacy of any
        power comes from the will of its Peoples and their right to 
        be free and democratically ruled.

     3. Respect for Europe's history, traditions and cultural values

        Peoples and Nations of Europe have the right to protect 
        their borders and strengthen their own historical, 
        traditional, religious and cultural values. The Group 
        rejects xenophobia, anti-Semitism and any other form 
        of discrimination

     4. Respect for national differences and interests: 
        Freedom of votes

     Agreeing on embodying these principles in its proceedings, 
     the Group respects the freedom of its delegations and 
     Members to vote as they see fit.

From France, it appears that you'd be fine on SNCF, Thalys or DB trains, possibly with a small charge on some trains. However, Eurostar doesn't allow animals so you can't actually get to France that way.

Eurotunnel allows pets, but that involves having a car. This is obviously a common issue because one Folkestone taxi company advertises that they will take you on the train with your pet. That won't be cheap though. Ferries have a similar problem, most will allow pets but not with foot passengers. Stena Line does allow pets, and you can get a [rail and sail ticket](http://www.stenaline.co.uk/ferry-to-holland/rail-and-sail) straight from London to Amsterdam.

It looks like the cheapest option that doesn't involve any smuggling may be to find a car share for the channel crossing by ferry or Eurotunnel, then use trains on either side.

Once you are in a financial position to be able to contribute to it ""properly"", you should do so. As the commenter above said, you may *need* the money, but you also may only want it. The general rule of thumb (as provided by MoneySavingExpert anyway) is to halve your age when you start saving and put that much as a % of your salary (including from your employer) into your pension pot until you retire. This will stop you being old and in poverty. It's a long way off now, but boy will future-you be glad you did it.

Edit: I notice you say you'll be going back to university after this, so I assume this is a year in industry? One thing you may want to bear in mind is what your pension scheme will make you do with the money if /when you stop contributing to it. It is not uncommon for pension schemes to make you move the money to another pension provider if you pay in for less than two years. If you have nowhere to pay it in to, and you can't get a refund, you might lose the whole thing.

&gt; The sources of data used are: 
&gt; 
&gt; • The International Passenger Survey (IPS), a voluntary sample based survey. It is the prime 
&gt; source of long-term migration data providing estimates of both inflows and outflows, but does 
&gt; not cover all migration types 
&gt; 
&gt; • Labour Force Survey (LFS) – provides a geographical distribution of long-term immigrants for 
&gt; the calibration of IPS inflow data 
&gt; 
&gt; • Home Office immigration administrative systems, which provide data on asylum seekers and 
&gt; their dependants for 1991 onwards 
&gt; 
&gt; • Long-term international migration data based on GP registrations from the Northern Ireland 
&gt; Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) for estimating long-term international migration to and 
&gt; from Northern Ireland and the rest of the world, from 2008 onwards.


As you can see, the UKBA (which handles passport checks) is not present in the list of data sources for the report. So, no... The ONS methodology is not flawed. Just your understanding of it.

If the talks between Labour and the Lib Dems were unsuccessful then the Conservatives could try ruling as a minority Government; or if all else fails another General Election could be held a few months later.",0,1400095862,null,0,false,0,chhzfc1,t3_25jxtx,t1_chhzfc1,t1_chhw68g,null,1433796514,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

You're entitled to JSA until the day you actually start work, so don't feel like you have to sign off early.  I would ask your future employer to send you a letter with the job offer, so you have some evidence to show at the sign on/job seeker interview.  Be sure to get them to put your start date on the letter.  This then becomes legally binding and almost as good as a signed contract.

There's also phone number you can ring when you are ready to sign off, do this at 4pm the day before you start work,  you don't need to go into the jobcentre to do this.  Infact there's probably a bank of phones the kind security guards will point you to to sign off if you go down.  Get the number when you go to sign on, or at your job search interview.

You can also ask the job centre for assistance with travel and clothing if you need.  Just be sure to ask them straight out in the job search interview/signing on appointment.  (Not sure how this works if you are moving away, but you can ask).

"" I have been offered a job, however I haven't been given a firm start date.  Can you advise me if I can get financial assistance with travel to and from work?  A bus pass costs £whatever for a week, and I will need one for x amount of weeks before I am paid""  (They won't pay for taxi's or for travel over an hour and a half away from where you live).

""Can I also get assistance with clothing for work.  My employer requires me to wear a suit/uniform, however I am unable to afford this myself.  What assistance can you offer me""

Shy bairns get no sweets mate.  The worst they can say is no.  I can't remember if you need to have signed on for a certain amount of time, but you can always ask. 

Good luck in your new job.  Final point,  make sure you hand in your P45 from the Jobcentre to your employer.  I had a nightmare with HMRC trying to claw back taxes from 2011 this year when I signed on for a week and the job centre hadn't told them when I actually signed off.  The P45 is very important,  even if your employer asks you to fill out a P46.  MAKE SURE YOU GIVE THEM THE P45 when it comes in the post.  If it doesn't come, make sure you chase it with the job centre.  This will keep your Tax and NI up to date.

Depends where you go. If you go to a Suzuki dealership, it will probably be quite expensive, compared to a local garage. Can't give a price since see above.

Well, central London will always be more expensive than if you go somewhere in Greater London, or even into the counties. Call up a few garages and get a quote.. Can't hurt.

My opinion with at least car services is that a manufacturer will probably do a better job, since (at least you'd like to think) they'd know everything about the bike and have had the right training, and you will be offered a better service than say a local garage.

The city bus system is run by a few different companies, but tickets are valid on most buses within the city area so you don't need to worry too much.  The two main companies are Stagecoach (who also run the Oxford Tube which goes to London - they are a national company) and the Oxford Bus Company.  From the Oxford Bus Company you can get a rechargeable bus ticket thing called the Key, which you buy specific types of credit for (it's a bit confusing I find, but it is cheaper if you use the bus a fair bit).  I think Stagecoach do a similar thing, but when I lived in the city I had a Key and you don't need both.

The buses from Heathrow are expensive and they will only take cash, I think, although you can buy tickets in advance and bring a print out.

So you are just relocation the same problems to a city a few hundred miles away just to rebalance the economy. I'll admit that's a laudable goal, but it doesn't make much of a difference from that perspective.

It also limits people's travel options - right now people arriving at Heathrow can get on a tube, or on the Heathrow Express, or on a bus or in a taxi or on a coach, and they can end up anywhere in London rather swiftly.

There is capacity there if airlines want to use it. But since it is deliberately (and limited to) catering to a niche market, price is higher for the exclusivity. Low supply of flights (or seats, rather) from LCY results in high prices. If the demand really was there for more flights it would be operating nearer capacity. 

London City makes connections virtually impossible without then having to travel to Heathrow, and the runway is too small for long flights without stops and the airport can't handle many aircraft types because the approach is too steep and most planes aren't allowed to do it.

I'm sure a 737 can land at that airport. But a fully loaded 737 needs a runway of at least 7,500 feet for taking off (this is for the smaller ones, for the size Ryanair use, the 737-800 needs an extra few hundred feet).

London City's runway is only 4984 feet. A 737 therefore can't take off from there. Even if it removed a load of seats it'd be a struggle and probably a waste of fuel.

Your second point, that the cold war and NATO have been a big factor in European peace is certainly true. But that peace has survived the cold war by 25 years, and there has been no fighting within the EU. 

NATO should not be necessary for this. The EU is a framework that Europeans can use to become adults again. The choice to continue to lean on NATO is a mistake.

There's no other real alternative. Lib Dems make sense personally, but they've been royally fucked over in ConDem government. 

I want to vote Nick Clegg. He's not a liar. He's not a hypocrite. People love the rhetoric that Nick fucked over Lib Dem voters in the last election by going back on his promises. But I think it's important to acknowledge that he said over and over that he wanted to get everyone round the table and was willing to give into his election promises for the good of the country. He did exactly that. He had too. The country was in economic crisis, he had a chance at getting the AV vote in (which would have boosted Lib Dem chances in this election) and he didn't trust Gordon Brown. 

Now I can't vote Conservatives. I've seen too much suffering. Too many people scrounging to get by. They have too many idiots (insert GOVE or May) in power. I also personally know someone who's a conservative party member and frankly his attitude to the poor is very poor. They also forced my ISP to block porn. Which is the main reason if I'm honest.

There was a trans person in sixth form who was just seen as a joke. This was a fairly sheltered school so they weren't attacked, but they weren't respected at all. Loads of people just directly referring to gay people as ""faggots"" as well; not even the ""it doesn't even have anything to with sexuality!"" defence some people use, it was just ""that faggot from [name of school]"" and people talking about ""faggot parades"". At rougher schools I imagine it was a lot worse. There were schools near me where they were pretty strong racial tensions, and I met a fair few flat out racists who went there, so I imagine the homophobia was on a higher level as well, as one type of prejudice often accompanies another. 

Holding hands with the same sex often elicits dirty looks and comments as well in a lot of places, and the possibility of attack in rougher areas. There are areas where you'll be ok with gay PDA but there's a huge number of places where you won't.

However, in my experience unless you are at the complex end of things you can manage on your own.

true,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"&gt;I think it's very dangerous to believe that laws can ever be equivalent to a moral framework. Each person's morals are different, yet we must all live together. The law must apply equally to everyone.

While everyone's opinion on what is moral or ethical may be different, laws *should* represent a moral framework for society. Good laws are made because ""society"" has a belief about something. For example, while there may be some people that believe rape is fine, ""society"" believes it to be immoral, and thus it is illegal.

Conversely, if our government passed a law restricting our free speech (which constitutionally they can do btw) would you still say we should abide by the law ad be treated equally by it?

If the government passed a law banning people from referring to the Iraq war as illegal, would you think it's right that you have to choose between doing something society believes is justified (speaking freely) or your freedom?

The fact you think Putin gives two shits about international law is bad enough (hint: he doesn't) but you thinking that our laws shouldn't reflect society's moral framework isn't dangerous is just odd.

If our laws do not reflect our values and beliefs as a society, what are they there for? To simply stop us from killing each other? If that's the case you better back laws banning alcohol, freedom of speech, pre-martial sex, pretty much everything that can cause a fight.

There are plenty of words that can be used in code, including ""thug,"" as recently discussed by star (American) football player Richard Sherman.

Switching up pronouns, paragraph by paragraph, for example, is a different sort of animal. The trick is that the more it catches on, the less contrived it will appear to the casual observer. In the U.S., there have been a great many words used to demean women and people of color over the centuries. And as those who sought progress pushed for a change in nomenclature - say, from n***** to colored to African-American, I daresay that each of these novel naming conventions felt awfully contrived for a decade or two. (I understand that the U.K. itself may not have a sparkling record on racism/sexim, but I've never lived there ;) ) But without risking contrivance, wouldn't we just be stuck with the all the old linguistic baggage that's been used to keep people of color and women down?

Remember that it was only in 1990 that a flagrantly racist brand of toothpaste was modified into [""Darlie""] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlie) (a somewhat less flagrantly racist brand name). I bet plenty of Asian consumers thought this change pendantic and contrived as well.

UKIP does as a means to an exit.   

You're cherry picking a poll for continued membership (and there's more than a few polls showing it the other way as a more longterm trend).  There was a Bruges poll that asked for the first time people that were already aware of the EEA-EFTA dynamic whether they supported that as opposed to the current EU model and over 70% said they did.  The lesson being that the more informed they are to the alternatives the more trade over federalism makes sense.

http://www.brugesgroup.com/eu/71-said-they-would-prefer-britain-to-leave-the-eu-and-join-efta.htm?xp=comment

In January a standard poll put a majority wanting to leave the EU:

http://www.euractiv.com/uk-europe/52-brits-vote-leave-eu-tomorrow-news-532867

It's only recently that there's been some wavering around the centre ground with polls going head to head.  The longstanding trend is in UKIPs favour.  The indicators of once people know more about the alternatives seems to support their stance.

If you think the majority will vote No then fine, let's have a referendum.  

But don't say things like, 

         ""an opinion UKIP is trying to force onto the European people.""

When it is you that is arguing that the UK should vote down constitution reform TWICE on the whole of the EU, and only then go for a UK referendum on an exit, or things like, 

          ""UKIP don't want a referendum""

Because on both you're palpably wrong.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Well at least you're a little smarter than the usual Kipper astroturf. Let's tackle this from two angles - straight and then let's look at the roots of the symbols and metaphor you use.

My original question was why a person who is LGBT would support a policy that discriminates people for an accident of birth. The whole rationale for granting a person equal rights is that all human beings deserve equal rights = thus a person who is born LGBT is so because the essential nature of their being thus has the same ""natural"" rights as everyone else. Those are rights accrued by the individual. A person who is LGBT should not be discriminated against because of how they were born. 

Your rationale for UKIP's policy is: 

&gt;Somebody without close links doesn't mean they won't get social housing (something their housing spokesperson argues should be extended), only that if you don't have close links to an area over somebody in a similar position who does - that it's a lesser upheaval for that person to be afforded social housing elsewhere.

But that's discrimination based on the circumstances of someone's birth. It doesn't matter that the priority is less, the existence of a priority in the first place is discrimination. 

If someone decided, that you have less priority to social housing because you happen to be gay, it would amount to the same thing. Imagine if the rationale was that that the majority of couples in the areas happen to be heterosexual and have heterosexual family ties. 

Essentially what you're doing is denying a person a service because of who they are and what they are. 

Again I fail to understand why a LGBT person who has seen discrimination within his/her lifetime would support that.

Up to *20% of the UK population of British Citizens* are foreign born or have foreign born parents (source: http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/migobs/Briefing%20-%20Immigration%20Population%20and%20Ethnicity_0.pdf).

Does this mean that your party is no going to rob them of the same rights as other British citizens? 

I'll be back in the next post with a response to the rest of this

true,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"I remember Lucas at 21. My god, he was dreadful. My heart rate doubled whenever the ball was near him. Inconsistent, naïve and seemed a poorly defined imprint when compared to the great Javier Mascherano. But then, somehow and at some point, things changed. Lucas Leiva became mature, consistent. He became strangely... irreplaceable. When he got injured, we were lost - an important cog gone on shore leave. Weird, that. Sure, his injuries became more frequent and with each injury, the need to find an apprentice/replacement became more and more of a pressing issue. But for a while, Lucas Leiva was indispensable. 

I also remember Jordan Henderson at 21. My god, he was frustrating. My heart rate tripled whenever the ball was near him. Inconsistent, naïve and seemed a vaguely resonant echo of Steven Gerrard. But then, somehow and at some point, things changed again. Jordan Henderson became vital and consistent. He was our engine. He was almost like two midfielders in one. Attacking? Sure, there's Jordan making a run and doing his little back-heel thing. Defending? Well, Jordan's on the line, making the clearance. Interlinking in midfield? Christ, I could swear I saw Jordan somewhere on the goal line a second ago but nope, there he is asking for the ball. And when he made that idiotic challenge against City and we lost him for three games? I told my mates: ""Chaps, you don't know this and I hope I'm wrong, but that is our title there getting red-carded"". And, in a way, it was. Still, how the hell did that headless chicken become so important to us? 

Sure, for every Lucas Leiva and Jordan Henderson there is a Ryan Babel or Jay Spearing. And for every Jordan Henderson and Jay Spearing there is a Rory Delap, who was, is and forever will be a Rory Delap - an entity time references itself against, for it intrinsically stays the same and is ignorant of physics. 

But the point is, little Jon Flanagan is only 21. Sure, he is inconsistent. Sure, he is a bit maldefined going forward. Lacks a killer pass or a shot. And can be a bit rash at times. But hey, the boy's only 21. He's playing as a full back and not even on his natural side! Defending... that is the toughest role in football. It requires vision and maturity. You're asking a player to display the anticipation and calm of a centre back and the vision and technical ability of an attacking midfielder. At 21! Sure, there are freaks who can do that at a young age. We read about them in the papers each day and they command prices so big my brain just switches off and goes on a coffee break. But that's a few precocious geniuses. Most players have to mature, have to play. But they can still become class. Look at Lucas. Look at Jordan. 

Give the boy time. Whether he stays or goes, judge him at 25, when he's had a chance to play football and gain experience. Not now, after a season. Although, blimey, for a 21 year-old full back on the wrong side, he's done fairly well! I know you want to know now and see the potential in a nice graph - ""oh, he's an 78, but will be 87 by mid-April next season"". Life doesn't work that way. Brendan sees something in him.

1) Keep high fuel prices exactly as they are

2) Keep building houses as we have been since God knows when

3) Do something about private rent contracts (although these are governed by the economy so not sure how)

4) Make 10p tax difference look amazing by confusing people with a couple of quid extra in their pockets while still paying the extra vat on everything.

5) Ban exploitative zero-rate contracts... ok this I can get behind.

6) Strengthen minimum wage? Does that mean increase? decrease? or just do some shit to strengthen a crappy wage? Reward firms who boost by offering basic pay?.... meh

7) Back small businesses by reducing business rates... not something that affected my small business but maybe.... reforming the banks however... what? How? What will that do?

8) Helping working parents. Sadly not something which affects me however this does sound like it'll make a positive impact.

9) Tackle the abuse of migrant labour to undercut wages... this is a big bugbear of mine. If someone is able to quit their home country, live in Britain in crappy conditions and work for less than Brits do, then there is something wrong. Two things to be precise... 1) That the country they leave to seek their fortune doing so is really crappy. And there is nothing Britain can realistically do about that bar pressuring other countries to be as good as Britain. 2) That British people aren't willing to live in crappy conditions to prove a point and get to work.

10) Back the next generation with a job guarantee... now how the feck is that going to happen unless you create a quango with over a million staff formed to do nothing but regulate each other?

true,WobbleWagon,null,null,"&gt;Well at least you're a little smarter than the usual Kipper astroturf

Errr....thanks, I guess.

&gt;My original question was why a person who is LGBT would support a policy that discriminates people for an accident of birth. 

Well no, you didn't say that.

First of all you said main policy which I considered to be about controlled immigration.  You then clarified around social housing priority - and it's that that I addressed....but I'll go with your now 3rd point if you wish.

&gt;The whole rationale for granting a person equal rights is that all human beings deserve equal rights = thus a person who is born LGBT is so because the essential nature of their being thus has the same ""natural"" rights as everyone else.

I agree.  No problems there.  Equality before the law.  Which is why they argued for extended civil rights under civil partnership to a level of parity with religious institution.

&gt;But that's discrimination based on the circumstances of someone's birth. It doesn't matter that the priority is less, the existence of a priority in the first place is discrimination.

No it's not. It's means tested around somebody's circumstances.  It might be a crude means of assessment, but it's still assessment.  I don't receive welfare benefits.  I'm not being discriminated against as such but it makes no sense for the government to give me welfare I don't need.  If you're assessing someone around how best to help them, and how to best attribute resources I'm going to keep the people with a local family support network but with not much disposable income for travel closer to their family as that way they're going to have more support and find it easier to build themselves up.  The person that doesn't have local family links in situ is still going to get help, they're just not going to be prioritised for the limited local housing when it's not as much as a hardship for them to be in a different neighbourhood.

You don't have to agree with it, but malicious discrimination it is not.

&gt;If someone decided, that you have less priority to social housing because you happen to be gay, it would amount to the same thing. 

Wait.  WHAT?!

a) it's not the same thing.

b) it's a silly thing to say.

c) nobody is even suggesting such a thing.

Their sexuality is a completely irrelevant issue to the matter.  Gay people still have grandparents, right?

&gt;Imagine if the rationale was that that the majority of couples in the areas happen to be heterosexual and have heterosexual family ties.

You're off on one bizarre route.  Why imagine that rationale?  It's not a rationale that applies.

Maybe you've got an argument that you're expressing really badly, but I don't know what it is.

&gt;Essentially what you're doing is denying a person a service because of who they are and what they are.

I'm denied false prosthetic legs that other people get on the NHS.  I'm not discriminated against.  I just have two legs.

If there are two people applying for social housing one with close family links and the other who doesn't it's not persecution when you choose that it makes more sense to give the local housing to the person with local links.  More likely than not you're going to end up paying more to provide childcare to the person that has to move further afield so they can go to work.

&gt;Again I fail to understand why a LGBT person who has seen discrimination within his/her lifetime would support that.

If you want to talk about a LGBT issue, then choose an LGBT issue.  Don't try and shoehorn it around a separate housing issue.

&gt;Up to 20% of the UK population of British Citizens are foreign born or have foreign born parents

And?

The main benefactors of this policy are third gen migrants whose grandparents have settled in inner city areas which they can't possibly afford to stay in, essentially breaking up families and communities.  This simply serves as one means to help keep family units closer together, to build communities and integration.

&gt;Does this mean that your party is no going to rob them of the same rights as other British citizens?

They get exactly the same rights.  The same test applies to all equally.  Just as the prosthetic NHS leg test is applied equally.

&gt;I'll be back in the next post with a response to the rest of this

Then please, think things through a little more thoroughly, or make more relevant comparisons, because for a moment back there you went completely off the logic fairway and somewhere off into the trees.

Now, i think we would get a bump in morale in the locker room regardless of who we appoint. Seemed that some of our better players were (as you pointed out) very unhappy with Sherwood for a myriad of reasons. A new manager coming in will help with that but getting an ""advocate"" for his ability and ideas inside the locker room just would make his transition that much easier. 

Poch doesn't necessarily need it to be made easier but i would love to see us take every step to try and ensure that all aspects of his transition go as smooth as possible.

A plot twist in a romantic comedy can be contrived. The excuses made for benching your star striker may be contrived. The rationale for a more inclusive vocabulary is a good bit more important than those things.

Is it really so hard to understand how the persistent use of monolithic pronouns - intentional or otherwise - reinforces stereotypes about abilities, intelligence, and fitness for particular fields?

When the entire Board of Directors is white, or male, or both, does this not send a message to those who are different? When the college applications handbooks have only white faces, does it really not matter to you? Is it really necessary to use a racial epithet to make the point?

Words matter. Symbols matter.

The problem is I don't really think it's that much of a large portion.

If anything it's a vocal minority of gay men who can't stop telling people how gay they are, and how much injustice there is against gay people.

And then add to that a bunch of people who aren't even gay themselves but want to reap the political points for being ""Pro-Gay"".

It's depressing.  Most of us just want to get on with our lives, not falsely represented by some political agenda.  But the moment any of us speak up we're branded (by the people who claim to be ""Pro-Gay"", no less) as mistaken beings who have ""internalised homophobia"".

true,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"Makes sense really. Aspas was a gamble that didn't quite work out. Sure, he never had much of a chance, but one shouldn't be waiting for a chance at 26. Kelly... I do love Martin but, as with Lucas, his injury proneness means we can't really rely on him. In fact, the same goes for Agger. Furthermore, Agger would probably command quite a decent transfer fee that could be re-invested into a young promising centre back. Don't get me wrong - Agger is a near-legend in my eyes, but at 29 he is at his peak (therefore being able to attract a good bid) whilst also being at an age where his injury worries are unlikely to get better (to say the least). 

Seeing as Ilori is likely to go out on loan, it seems what Rodgers is going for is Skrtel+Sakho as first choice for next season, new CB (Caulker?) as direct competition/cover for the two and Wisdom playing the Kolo Toure role - a cup and back-up CB (with the added benefit of being able to play RB). I'm a bit nervous about this combination, to tell the truth, but I suppose it also depends on who he intends to bring in as the third competitive CB. 

With regards to Suso, Borini and Alberto, my take on it would be that Rodgers is happy to keep them on (perhaps even using the transfer speculation as a motivational tool - see Henderson last summer), but if a decent offer arrives, he's also happy to take that and re-invest accordingly. 

This as opposed to Reina, Toure and Assaidi, where we seem to be happy to accept any takers. 

Coates probably sits somewhere in between the above two categories. 

I know this 'exodus' seems worrying, but I doubt they'd be letting all these players go without either promoting an equivalent from the reserves (e.g. Ibe, Teixeira, Wisdom) or signing new players (Lallana, Caulker, Christian Poulsen).

&gt;b) it's a silly thing to say.

&gt;c) nobody is even suggesting such a thing.

&gt;Their sexuality is a completely irrelevant issue to the matter.

You don’t understand the difference between natural rights and accrued rights. Accrued rights are transactional, natural rights are inviolable. We can go through the whole construction of these ideal all the way back to Lock and Rousseau if you wish but I can’t be bothered. You can do your research on that. 

We live in a liberal democracy and a liberal democracy accepts the notion of natural rights and accrued rights. When it comes to natural rights these are things that we are born with, and the thus the state that we arrive in considered protected. This also extends to the notion that a person who cannot change the circumstances of their birth should not be penalised for it. 

We cannot arrest people and imprison them for their skin colour, if we do that we stop being a liberal democracy. Why? Because we have violated the natural right to be free on the basis on something a person cannot control ie. their skin colour. 

 A human being has the right to be treated equally and fairly. This is above and beyond citizenship. Our accrued rights of citizenship reinforce that – anyone who is a British citizen should have the right to be treated equally as a citizen. So on two counts a person who hold a British passport has the right to be treated the same as everyone else. I assume this is the case with UKIP who claim to have a civic model of citizenship.

By that token, I cannot control where I was born, or who my grandparents were. I have no power over that decision, and it is part of who I am. What you’re proposing is an immediate penalty for something I can’t control and have no possibility of changing it unless I got back in time and re-invent my entire timeline. Which is as implausible as asking an LGBT person not to be gay. 

The only way you could argue that preventing all British citizens from having those equal rights is then to argue that citizenship isn’t equal. Then the questions become, if one citizen is not equal to another, then on what grounds we separate out citizenship? But because our citizenship reinforces the extant nation of natural human rights – does changing the nature of citizenship then begin to ask undermine whether we consider a fellow citizen fellow human? 

Now you argue that it’s all about circumstance, it would be if the test for “local” was something I could change. So, for example, if I chose to live within an area for five years – then I could be considered local.  That would mean, I would have the possibility of changing my circumstances by sticking around for five years and my priority would increase the more I did. That would become a right I accrued through my transactions with the local community. 

But once you start including criteria that say my parents or grandparents have to be local to the area, then it becomes about a reality I cannot change. It becomes discrimination against my essential nature. 

All that stuff about families breaking up etc that you have posted is diversion from the essential philosophical and ethical issues that this policy poses. 

Or the short version: 

&gt;please, think things through a little more thoroughly,

Oh and with regards to this 

&gt;This emulsion thing 

You mean conflation and I'm not conflating anything. I asked you:

Criminals are jailed 1. to discourage others from doing it 2. to physically stop them from committing crime.

Rape is more harmful than a false accusation of rape, so in this case there is less need to discourage, and if they make another accusation they are less likely to be believed (and they can still make false accusations even if jailed). So physically being in prison doesn't help.

For a harsher sentence, you need to show that it would actually deter false accusations, and then balance this against the damage done to the perpetrator's life. E.g. we could execute false accusers and this might greatly deter it but then we'd have quite a few deaths on our hands.

Metaphysical notions or the feeling of 'justice being done' should play absolutely no part in sentencing.

Details on how they'll reform the energy market? That doesn't seem very conclusive, and I might think their reform is a rubbish idea. 

&gt;Get 200,000 homes built a year by 2020

So 40,000 a year? Isn't the shortage to the tune of 100K+ a year? At least I don't need to worry about my house price if labour get in then! 

&gt;Stop families that rent being ripped off and help them plan for the future with new long term predictable tenancies

Quite right. Decent proposal. Ripped off presumably meaning letting agent fees as mentioned a few days ago.

&gt;Cut income tax for hardworking people through a lower 10p starting tax rate, and introduce a 50p top rate of tax as we pay off the deficit in a fair way

The 10p tax rate again? This was already tried, wasn't it? Just up the tax free allowance if you want to make ~~poorer people~~ harder working people pay less tax.

&gt;Ban exploitative zero-hour contracts

Are these really that much of a problem? The ONS figures seem to show it's not. 

&gt;Make work pay by strengthening the Minimum Wage and providing tax breaks to firms that boost pay through the Living Wage

The Devil is in the details. 

&gt;Back small businesses by cutting business rates and reforming the banks

Cutting rates, okay I get that. But how does reforming the banks play into helping small businesses? Just wanted to get a dig at the banks in there, didn't you?

&gt;Help working parents with 25 hours of free childcare for three- and four-year-olds

Jeez, how much is that going to cost? My sister pays £75 a day.

&gt;Tackle the abuse of migrant labour to undercut wages by banning recruitment agencies that only hire foreign workers and pressing for stronger controls in Europe

Suso last time he played for us, before the loan, had to be moved out to the wing most of the time due his inability to get to where he needed to be. (IIRC, and my exam results that it may not always be accurate). I love the lad, and he's got a great attitude, the problem is though, he might not be cut out for Rodgers' style.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The question is how much patience we can afford, can we expect the club to develop lucas or hendo (when they first came) in the future? Or will we get players who are at that level in their teens and become regulars at 21.

Nearly every player will develop with gametime and coaching, but the club had to pick it's battles and ask if someone from the academy is on similar level/potential. For all Alberto did at barca b, is he developed enough to play regularly and contribute, if not you might as well play youth player from academy.

Borini might come in and contribute, but again the club has to ask what they expect of their third choice. Borini is decent starter, but not impact sub nor likely to bench either of our strikers. What happens if they are on bad run? Start Borini and he might at his current level play decently, but can he lead the line? City can afford to play Negredo when Dzeko is out of form and vice versa (ignoring jovetic), both can lead the line and change games scoring multiple goals. Is Borini a Hernandez, Dzeko, Negredo or is he Ba, Torres, Welbeck type who shows results over 30 games but not short stints or from bench. 

Then there is Suso, he really is capable of playing everywhere except defense and striker, ignoring set piece, can he contribute while developing, can he get decent form and bench one of the bad form players, can he fit our different formations etc. Notice all of our attackers press, no g/a is acceptable as long as they are part of build up and winning possesion, how good is Suso in that. Obviously his flashes of brilliancr is great, but pressing and passing will get him more minutes than odd goal or assist from many long balls or shots. 

How many can we afford to develop (youth + expetience) and dhould he be one of them or should we get players that fit the style better. A Lallana comes in and Suddenly Suso has to compete with him and Sterling, Cou, all who press and tackle. 

My point being the squad and style comes before sentiment anf future potential of which many of our players have. Think of Suso, Borini, Alberto as players we are looking to sign to see it from a new perspective, would you be content or euphoric. I would have liked Borinis movement, but wouldn't be crushed if we missed out. For Suso I would have loved his movement with the ball, but not his many longshots and lack of eye for decive passes like another player we have, he is also very one footed but makes most of it. Would feel a bit sad, but not too crushed even if another rival got him. For Alberto not much except what he could become if he could translate his g/a to higher level, specially tjose long shots and placed shots much like I wad when we missed out on Gylfi.

I remember many people in the beginning of this season felt that it'd be Skrtel's last season for us when he had reported links to clubs in Italy,and that we'd showcase him as much as possible(over Agger) to make him look attractive and cash in when club's took notice. Obviously with his pretty solid performances this season, Skrtel is a pretty decent asset and will likely be kept.

I think Agger's worth keeping around but I also feel like if he can't starting games, he's gonna want to bounce.

I'm not too sure what the point of selling Lucas would be.

I wouldn't be surprised if Kolo left since I feel like at this stage he's gonna transition into on the road to retirement journeyman. I like Martin Kelly a lot since he's excellent with taking the ball up the sides and setting things up, but he can also be a bit of a flight risk and inconsistent at times.

This is gonna be a bit of a tricky situation, the club has a lot of talent but a good lot of these people would expect first team stuff and don't wanna be backup.

EDIT: With Borini and Suso having pretty eventful seasons, I can't imagine them wanting to be relied on as backups. I would maybe loan or sell Aspas, and try to incorporate Borini. With Champions League in the mix, tired legs and injuries are quite the reality and we'll need a capable forward when Suarez or Sturridge need a break.

With Negredo getting injured then playing poorly for half a season, aguero missing half and jovetic out for 3/4 of season. I think it would be foolish to rely on two people with a season of experience and one who has been missing large spells recently.

So you would have to replace him, could use guidetti but he is unproven. Or buy elsewhere though like we saw with jovetic, negredo. No answer how they will perform and adapt to the prem.

Many years ago *(nearly twenty years ago)* I worked briefly for one of the power companies in one of the billing departments over the summer.  I have a vague recollection of there being some rule allowing them to attribute part of the bill to someone on the basis of beneficial use.

This was a really long time ago and it was one of those, *""If you see this there are extra rules.""* areas.

That said, **[this](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/consumer_e/consumer_energy_supply_e/consumer_energy_bills_e/consumer_understanding_your_energy_bill_e/who_is_responsible_for_paying_the_energy_bills_.htm)** might be relevant to you.

&gt;If you live with other people

&gt;If you live with other people, there may be a disagreement about who is liable for the bills. Generally, only the person who is named on the bill can be made responsible for paying it. But a supplier might argue that everyone who lives in a property shares liability for the bills. This is a complex legal area. If your supplier is chasing you for payment and you are not named on the bill, ask them for an explanation of the basis for their claim. They will need to prove that the person who made the contract did so on behalf of other residents.

I'd say that Caldariblue's advice is pretty sound but bear in mind what that article says.  If they claim you have any pre-existing liability make them put the basis for it in writing and agree to nothing until you've seen it and had a chance to think about what they said.

Personally I would suggest you refuse to give them any personal information if that comes up, since the law more or less allows them to screw your credit rating with a spurious CCJ *(which as a bonus will make getting a new flat far more difficult)* which will be a giant pain in the ass to get off your record.",0,1400119942,null,0,false,0,chiaut6,t3_25kizy,t1_chiaut6,t1_chi2id1,null,1433802029,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It also removes the need to use harmful, environmentally-damaging chemicals, and so eliminates the side-effects this has on humans and wildlife.

true,jjones217,num23,,"No offense, but that's a really shitty argument. Managers get hired all the time in moves that make their club's fans or even just fans of other teams in the league go WTF?

Reasons may vary, but teams don't always hire managers based on how good of a manager they are. Often times, as was the case with AVB at Porto, they get hired because of how good of a manager the cub thinks they *could* be. Which is the same reason he was hired at both Chelsea and Tottenham.

When I say mediocre, I don't mean he was a shit manager. I literally mean mediocre - middle of the road. And his 11 wins, 9 draws, and 10 losses in his 30 games as manager at Academica clearly back that statement up.

Porto saw his and though ""hey, this guy was mentored by Mourinho and has experience in management in our club. He saved a relegation threatened side with somewhat shit players and brought them to mid-table by season's end. Maybe if he gets a squad full of great players, he'll be an amazing coach.""

So they hired him, he got lightning in a bottle, all was well.

Chelsea saw him, thought the same exact thing and thought - ""If he could do all that with Porto, imagine what he could do with the unlimited funds of CFC""

But his management acumen wasn't what his Porto experience reflected - Porto is small beans compared to the PL. Chelsea players were reluctant to accept a non-football foreigner with 2 seasons of club football managing experience as their manager. The locker room fractured, AVB was sacked. He would have done fine if they gave him time. He was learning on the job as well as bringing new things, but Chelsea are impatient.

Then  he went to Spurs, who thought the same thing as chelsea and porto -  ""this guy has serious potential"". Our squad is younger, fresher, and don't have a ton of allegiance to Redknapp or whoever, let's see if Spurs are more receptive to his management style and see if we can't strike lightning in a bottle like Porto did 2 years ago.""

And it almost worked. Club record points haul, 4th place finish. Things were looking up. But the play on the pitch rarely had fans convinced of AVBs ability. But as long as we're winning, who cares.

Well, the next season, with no Bale, the play on the pitch was about the same level of quality, but even worse because we didn't have a late game saviour and no one to open up the pitch for his teammates when the defense was parking the bus.

This led to a shittier result on points and the management realized that maybe AVB wasn't that great of a manager after all:

Shitty football + good (record, even) results = keep the manager

Shitty football + underwhelming results = sack the manager

=AVB out. Sherwood in. Sherwood sucks, thank God he's gone, and hopefully we'll get someone like de Boer to come in and give him 2-3 years to implement his system.

AVB is now at Zenit where he, again, seems to be striking lightning in a bottle. But thing is, Zenit were already the best team in the Russian League. Maybe not on points, (or maybe actually they were), but they are tops in the league and AVB has brought in fresh eyes and a new enthusiasm, which can carry a club a long way.

He'll probably use this as a springboard to another good job, but unless he gets a squad where the team are receptive to his styles and have players willing to change the system (maybe a team like Atletico if Simeone gets poached) I'm not sure he'll be able to do much once again.

If he get's hired by Barca or Real Madrid - I'm unconvinced as to the heights he'll actually be able to take those clubs.

I disagree.

In one situation, someone gets raped is traumatised. Certainly a horrible thing to happen.

In the other, someone goes to jail for 10 years, has their name destroyed, friends/family leave them, lose their job and career, lose any income for 10 years. Basically that will completely destroy your entire life. If someone gets send to jail for rape in their 20's or 30's, their life is basically over. Good luck finding a partner and getting married or building a career when you come out of jail.

I think those two things are pretty equal actually. Both totally fuck up your life, and both are done out of hate.

The most valid point you made IMO was about deterring offenders, which jail may not do. But you missed point number 3 - jail is also to punish people.",0,1400122790,null,0,false,0,chic2wu,t3_25k92r,t1_chic2wu,t1_chi88w6,null,1433802603,19,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,19

Now, this might make sense when assuming cisgenderedness- trans folks are a much smaller percentage of the population- but women?  There is a clear and unfortunate set of priorities at work that have an ugly precedent. 

So it's misleading to ask, How does using ""he"" hurt women.  The point is it doesn't particularly ""stick out"" from normalcy, to jab at women- a lot of discourse has a similar male-focused bent.  The question is, How can we start dismantling this common bias?  What are your priorities?

Apologies for the late reply -- I peek back at this sub very infrequently now. :)

The rushed ending seems like a corner we watched the writers paint themselves into with circular conflicts. They didn't advance Arthur's understanding of the role magic played in his world, which is something I believe a lot of us expected to see in later seasons. That meant Merlin's identity had to be presented to Arthur only as he was dying.

It's a frustrating show because it's wonderfully cast and enjoyable in many ways... but as you mentioned, the road they didn't take with Merlin and Arthur around S4 would have been so interesting. Less rehash with evil magical foes and repeatedly condemning trusted friends to death, more backstory on the knights. 

I have a lot of affection for the show as it is and I know I'll queue it up in the background at times in the future, but I like it enough that I'll always regret it didn't (IMO) fulfill the promise it showed at its best moments.

There's that fantastic moment in *The Eleventh Hour* when the Doctor recalls the Atraxi to tell them Earth is off-limits. It was exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately, the rest of the time I felt like Eleventh was more of an idiot savant; he could solve problems, but he needed someone to tug him along or help him with the details.

As the Smith series rolled on, I started getting a sense that this ""bumbling imaginary friend"" persona was more of a facade or a retreat for the Doctor. This is especially true by the time *The Angels Take Manhattan* comes around, and Eleventh ""grows"" up. Ultimately I was happy with Matt Smith, but no lie, it took me an entire season to accept him.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Glenn Patterson has a number of Belfast based novels and he's probably the best known local writer, bar Bateman, who I've never had much time for (anyone else seen Scup? It's rubbish.) 

My favourite contemporary Northern Irish author is Robert McLiam Wilson. He seems to have retired now, but he wrote a book called Eureka Street, which I reckon is easily the best book to come out of here in the last 30 or 40 years. And he was only about 29 when he penned it. It's an amazing read - a must read for anyone brought up in this city. His spiel on Laverys is literary gold - but the whole book's brilliant. 

If you want to go a little further back you can look at the likes of Bernard Maclaverty, but I think he's overrated and his writing's a little too bleak for the sake of being bleak, but then again I suppose he was reflecting the mood in the country at the time. Still, it's hard for me to relate. 

There's an even older novel called 'The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne,' written by Brian Moore, which is absolutely amazing and charts the lonely life of an old, alcoholic spinster in Belfast - it was written in the 50s or 60s, but it has a great amount of detail of the city and the city's culture at that time. It's one of the most heartbreaking books I've ever read and as well as being a great story it's technically superb.

Still, Eureka Street, or really anything by McLiam Wilson is top notch. He's not a perfect writer, but he represents Belfast life better than anyone else I've seen. That's why I prefer his work to Patterson's. I think Patterson is a really neat, clear writer but I always feel a little distant from his stories.

You could also check out a lot of local theatre if you're into contemporary Northern Irish characters - there are a number of great playwrights working in the city at the moment, (Owen McCafferty, Jimmy McAleavey, Rosemary Jenkins, David Ireland, the list goes on and on and there are a number of talented younger ones too)   there's simply not enough funding about to get as much on stage as exists in the various pockets of creativity (Queens/Pick'n'mix/local theatre companies.)

The train fare should be a train fare; not an extortion using invalid pricing logic.

It is for the same reason the government enjoys adding hundreds of pounds of ""environmental"" taxes on top of plane fares.

true,Yellowbenzene,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"It's about how the NHS views its workers.  A senior doctor, with decades of training and a service built around his or her special interests and expertise is not easy to replace.  The same is true concerning the sort of people that wind up being directors - you need a fearsome CV to reach that level in the NHS.  These people, rightly, should be retained.  Good conditions are part of that.  Comparing them to cleaners and street sweepers is disingenuous.  Yes, these people play an important role, but it's completely different.  Yes, they pay tax, but so does everybody else, including those who work for the NHS.  

In the private sector, employees are viewed as disposable by many companies.  Particularly, I'd imagine, in a sales role, where you are literally costing the company money if you aren't at work generating them profit by making sales.  There's currently no profit motive in the NHS - outcomes and patient throughput are the main metric of success.  I'd hazard a guess that sales staff are also easier to replace than an NHS consultant or director, meaning that T&amp;Cs don't have to be as favourable.  

The ""race to the bottom"" idea is well established and I think entirely appropriate to your statement that everybody should receive the bare minimum sick pay *mandated by law*.  Instead of everybody's conditions falling to meet those at the bottom, we should all be fighting for people to have good employment conditions.  As an NHS employee I would be very happy to support anybody in getting conditions as favourable as mine.

true,Rosti_LFC,lfc93,,"&gt; Defending... that is the toughest role in football. It requires vision and maturity.

I think this is one of the biggest points. Defending is hard, and most importantly it's something that requires a huge amount of experience, concentration, maturity and a load of other things that you can't just teach on the training ground. When going forward things like pace and energy, maybe the youthful naivety to try some outrageous flicks, all those aspects work as a benefit. As a defender pace is nowhere near as important as the ability to read the game and anticipate what's going to happen, and you only get that from experience, and importantly experience against top-calibre attacking players. It's not something you can do much about in training, because it'll never be the same as a proper competitive match against players you only face two or three times a year. 

You see plenty of attacking players break through at a young age - 17 to 19, but how many defensive players do? Carragher was basically in his mid-twenties by the time he started being one of our first choice centre-backs rather than a left or right back. John Terry was 21/22 before being a first-team regular at Chelsea. Rio Ferdinand was 22 when he moved to Leeds and 24 before he went to United. Gary Neville got into the United first team at 19, but wasn't rated all that well until quite a few years later. People are so used to seeing attacking teenagers that they assume any world-class player will already be a star before they hit 20, when actually for most defensive players 21-23 is the age where they start to shine and show their potential. 

It's Flanno's first proper season where he's had a decent run in the team, he's being picked ahead of a guy who is a natural left back and is five years older, and as a defender he's still got a year or two left before you'd really expect to start seeing him hit good form.",0,1400140863,null,0,1400143069,0,chihdzb,t3_25kqm5,t1_chihdzb,t1_chi5fea,null,1433805172,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

true,Ryean1,null,null,"Sharia law is God's law in written form. It does not see law as a human right but a Religious one for followers [and non-followers]. This requires the fact that most of your populace are Religious, firstly, and Muslims secondly. If you have a collectivism towards a God-created law in your civilization then that's what is followed. Some may see God's creation as nature, as the natural world and therefore see it as a natural law, and thus nature rights and responsibilities (predominately of those who believe). It is less likely however to transfer to those of other Religions or the non-religious. Sharia law classifies many subsets as natural rights, including in some Sects to marriage to multiple or even, what we would classify as, underage women. Rights though, is more so a Political than Religious theory. For example some countries which are Muslim are 'more moderate' in their 'versions' of the Sharia to accommodate for others. An organized society will widen the scope of understanding around these concepts. In other words they manipulate their version of Religious law.

This however, is not natural law. A man would not conduct such acts in a state of nature. Marriage is an artificial construct monopolized by civilizations. It is a legal and social binding of people. Now, this is the same for all human beings. In a natural state, without influence, we need no legal binding for social binding. Therefore, again, marriage is a legal right - not a natural one. Marriage, for me, does not exist under 'natural law'. The ""Churches teachings"" on marriage for example, do not count, no matter the Religion.

true,8u11etpr00f,null,null,"I definitely think we need to clear out the deadwood this year. Aspas, Brad Jones, Toure, Assaidi should all leave in my opinion. Also I believe when players get to certain ages/qualities they should not stay at a club where they are not going to get playtime and for that reason I believe Agger and Lucas should leave, don't get me wrong they are both great players but at the moment Sakho seems to be preferred over Agger and Agger is a bit too old to hang around and wait for first team football and with teams like Barcelona knocking I think Liverpool should cash in. With Allen being preferred over Lucas it seems his time has come to an end at LFC, I am of the opinion that a champions league team like Liverpool can do better in midfield than Allen, assuming that Brendan Rodgers also sees it that way Lucas is going to find himself way down the pecking order at Liverpool and for that reason I believe we should cash in (or sell Allen but I think Rodgers prefers him over Lucas). 
    
To be honest I am not sure if Enrique will come back in, he has been injured for a year and as Lucas showed it is not easy to come back from injury at such a crucial time in your career and with Liverpool looking into a couple of left backs from europe it looks as if he will depart soon (because I can't see Flanagan leaving next year, he will most likely be on the bench). I am of the opinion that Borini and Suso will stay for at least one more year with Rodgers wanting more depth and Borini and Suso are clearly good players to have around, although I think if large enough offers come in for either player Rodgers will just sell them and buy a replacement.
 
One player who I think HAS to leave this summer is Martin Kelly, the kid was good when he was 20/21 and looked a real talent but because of injuries and other factors he has lost his potential and with him now being 24/25 and Liverpool  still having Ilori and Wisdom to fill in he should definitely leave this summer. I had almost completely forgotten that Reina is still a Liverpool player and I am not sure how he has done at Napoli but when a good player is loaned out at that age it is only a question of when they leave and not if, providing that they didn't have a world class loan. Neither Cissokho or Moses should remain at Liverpool for obvious reasons. 

A few months back I was criticising Glen Johnson and everything he does, noticing all his mistakes and saying he should leave but following his appearances over the last couple of months I now believe just the opposite of that, he has looked solid at defending and going forward he has started to look like his old self. Luis Alberto is the final player with a question mark over his head but I think Rodgers should give him another year either on loan or on the bench, the kid is young and definitely should be given a chance (kind of falling under the same category as Suso). Also where the hell is Coates?!, he is apparently in the Uruguay squad but I think he only made 1 or 2 appearances all year, I definitely think he should have been given more of a chance at LFC.

As far as signings go I am rather afraid of Liverpool doing a Tottenham next year and signing a few players for 30 million which do not repay that price (players such as Parejo, Moreno, William Carvalho). I have always trusted Rodgers in the transfer market but with rumour of the transfer record of 35 mil being broken for a defensive midfielder in a poor league I can not help but worry.

At Espanyol, he had to deal with the club selling 10 of it's 1st team players so had to field youth players. From what I've read/seen (From people on Twitter posting videos/talking to Spanish fans) he was well regarded with the fans and the reason why he left was due to not receiving any money to replace those 10 players.


He's been a success for Soton, first half of the season, they were incredible. Think their loss of form was due to a lack of quality with their squad, not having quality back up players for players like lalalalalalna and Shaw. Something that *shouldn't* be a problem if he came to us.

The fact he speaks Spanish is a massive plus for me, Bobby and Lamela would surely benefit from that, as did Sandro with Boas. He has the ability to work with a small budget and a troublesome board room, both of which will occur at Spurs.

It's a bizarre situation where the victim gets anonymity. It essentially reinforces the stigma of rape. It says you should be embarrassed and want to hide this away. On the other hand people regularly say that the accused needs to have their name thrown around so other victims can come forward. Surely the same rule applies to accusers? What if they're known liars, or known accusers in the local community? 

Anonimity existing for either side at all in this crime has just come about because of the over zealous nature of the feminist crusade.

Councillors can be petty, back-stabbing, petulant children sometimes, and there's often a lack of respect and decency in the chamber.  If you're happy for the public to come in and watch there's no real difference... either the public see you in person, or they watch on film, you're just broadening the audience but not introducing any additional pressure they are not already under from the audience in the public gallery.

Editing of video after the fact could be an issue, but that's no different to someone writing up a selective report and publishing it on a blog or newspaper.  In some ways having a formal video record would help counter some of the misinformed opinions from the public.

My preference would be to have a semi-professional setup - proper lighting, decent audio, broadcast camera - which is streamed in real-time and subsequently uploaded to a council website for viewing.

As others have suggested, to say Lucas had the physical tools to be a holding midfielder at 21 is viewing the past through rose-tinted glasses at best and simply untrue at worst. He was weak, he was easily dominated by other players and very often out-muscled. That is why it took him two years to reach a good enough level - he needed to grow and bulk up, as well as gain experience. 

Pace is a reasonable concern but, whilst an advantage, I don't think it is necessary for a full back. Sure, it's more important for more of a wing back-type player like Johnson, who often contributes in the opponent's half and requires pace to compensate for his defensive lapses. But Flanagan is a different kind of footballer. He is more of a classic full back and there are more important things than pace for that role - /u/kopking08 and /u/Rosti_LFC point those out better than I can.

Aspas isn't that old, and if he's happy fighting for his chance as third choice striker then why the hell not? Wisdom is young, Suso is young, Borini is young, Assaidi's probably not the quality we want, and i would't want to see Agger leave and i don't think he will if i'm honest.

I don't think Lucas will go either since he gives our midfield a bit of flexibility, he's been played in a role not suited to his strengths, right after an injury. We were only relying on him to play there due to Henderson's absence but if Gerrard is out or if we need two dedicated holding players, for example if the opposition stick a man or two on Gerrard and we need some support in the role. He's going to be staying i think.

 I can't really put my finger on many players who are really deadwood apart from Assaidi and Reina ( sadly :( ) Kelly might be one to think about letting go and i think we need to give Coates a season on loan somewhere to get some game time back and see where he is after the injury. 

We need to bring in an attacking player or two, definitely at least one left back and possibly a quality central midfielder.

&gt; FSG are all about money for value, and Brendan constantly emphasizes player earning their wage. As much as he may, in theory, be a good fit for his system I don't think he justifies his reported [£110k+ a week](http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/sport-opinion/james-pearce-liverpool-fc-owners-6287987) a week salary. Plus, at 29, it's really the last chance for him to fetch a decent fee.
That, coupled with his form this season, which admittedly, could be due to his injuries (his injury proneness is also a big negative), is why I expected him to be in the category with Lucas and Agger.
I agree with regards the current circle jerk, lot of his criticism is unwarranted and unfair, especially the myth he can't defend. He's always a good outlet on the right hand side, he links up well with Suarez and we have missed him when he's been gone, however, I don't think he is good enough anymore to warrant a place in the starting XI of a team aiming for the title. He has been a liability recently, often putting us under pressure by losing the ball in dangerous areas.

We might ask why the media would do such a thing, and what we can do about it. Why would the media want to stop you from voting?

I suggest that the media are discouraging you from having any confidence in politics precisely so that you don't participate; so that you don't vote and so that your voice doesn't count; and this is how they maintain power while you have none.

The way to react against this, the way to beat them, is not to let them grind you down, not to believe anything the media tells you about politics, and not to be prevented from taking part in the process.

Another scandal in the news? Tories criticised in the Guardian and the Mirror? Labour and Lib Dems criticised in the Daily Mail and the Sun? Don't believe a word of it.

Wondering two things: What is ""Claimant error""? If the claimant has genuinely done something wrong which can't be counted as fraud, wouldn't that, in some way, be the DWP staff's fault in not checking the claim forms before accepting them?

As for Agger, I have said time and time again, Agger is a good defender, but something he has that I think is undervalued, is loyalty. The guy loves the club. You can't buy that, I think he should stay, its not like he's a bad defender.

Aspas, Toure, Brad Jones and Assaidi, yes I think maybe they should be out. Aspas hasn't really been able to show us what he can do, but what I have seen I haven't liked and Brendan will have seen more from him.

Toure I wouldn't mind staying, but he was always just a stop gap, he has done a job this year.

Brad Jones just isn't good enough to be at Liverpool and Assaidi just isn't a fit for the system we play, he was bought for Kenny and it shows. I hope he goes on to do well elsewhere though.

I'd like Enrique to stay, I think he deserves a chance to show if he can come back from his injury.

I agree with you on Martin Kelly, his injuries have really taken his toll on him.

Reina, I don't think anybody has expected him to come back at all.

I have been a strong defender of Glen Johnson, I think he should stay Ol' Glen, perhaps let his contract run out whenever it does? He has made a lot of mistakes and has played poorly this season. I wouldn't mind him staying, but he will have to improve between now and next Jan.

Luis Alberto, always one for the future, no doubt in my mind when I say he should stay.

Coates needs to come back, I think he will be given a chance.

true,CheekyLittleCunt,english,London,"No one is claiming that there aren't those that game the system. 

What a lot of people assume is that *most* people on benefits game the system, which is wrong. There are bad eggs, but that doesn't mean that the innocent should be punished by having the whole system upturned and depriving them of the help they need in order to stay above the poverty line. 

It's worth baring the cost of the dickheads abusing the help they get if it means the people who *actually* need the help get it too. I would rather that then give little help to anyone and watch the families that *need* benefits sink and drown along with the scroungers. 

Imagine being a single widowed mum of 3 looking for a job and living off of handouts, but then getting your benefit cut because of a new system that says you aren't eligible for it,  due to an upturn in the way benefits are calculated, because people kept complaining about benefit fraud. You didn't do anything wrong, you weren't the one who was trying to game the system; yet you get punished for the actions of the few. 

It's easy to be bitter about benefit fraud when you see people who don't even bother *trying* to get a job living on the dole, but for every one of those gaming the system, there's maybe 10 or 20 others who actually need it. I wouldn't want to throw away the whole batch because of 1 bad egg! Well that's the way I see it anyway. 

Next time you hear about benefit fraudsters sitting on their arses all day not looking for jobs, try not to think your money is going to them, think instead of the single mother you're helping out, or the elderly couple abandoned by their kids, or the small family that has lost their main bread-winner. When you have a more positive outlook on it and think of it as charitable and just genuinely being a good person, it becomes easier to accept that dickheads will be dickheads and abuse your charity; but it doesn't mean you should stop giving to the worthy.

Now, of course the sun and music is not the only entertainment they have. They also have all the sky channels, drink almost every night, smoke, and go fishing regularly. It's not the life of riley, granted. But it is free, and it is comfortable. 

Then we have the countless people at school I knew, whose parents would swear blind to everyone they 'really wanted a job', yet miraculously never got one!

You'd think if they were such naturally hard workers, just down on their luck of course, that they would clean up their garden? Maybe read to their children at night? Perhaps even wash their children's clothes frequently? Cook their children actual food instead of microwave or oven meals?

true,Evsie,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"I agree, Reddit can lack nuance - but remember the demographic (for the most part). The problem is those on the right paint all benefit claimants with the same brush. Everyone who can't find a job at the moment (and you know the figures about jobs/jobseekers, right?) is treated as though they are scum. It's worse in many ways for the recently employed. The long term unemployed learn how to get by on very little (and that's as it should be, it should be enough to survive, not enough to live amazingly well)... the recently employed have bills they set up when they had an income of x. Maybe a car on HP, a newer phone, credit card debt that goes from manageable to omfg in the space of not very long.

The vast majority of the ""benefits bill"" has nothing to do with the unemployed, it goes to pensioners and the working poor. Let me re-state that... the people who are employed by companies and corporations on so little money that they couldn't survive without government assistance... when do we get to have the conversation about that? 

Anyway, even focussing specifically on the out of work, it's a small percentage of those who are abusing the system as you describe it. I, and most reasonable people on the left, see this as a dishonest way to frame the discussion. We would rather see a few people abuse the system and the safety net protected, than thousands hurt in the name of stamping out a not-very-big-problem. 

Dealing with the issue of why people are happy not in work is a challenge - it needs to encompass education, and training, and showing people that there is a future for them, and looking at WHY they are happy not working... it's not just about making the benefits system so unappealing as to create disincentives. Nobody getting by on £70 a week is thinking they've made good choices.

That's the second time you've started a post with something condescending like that, as if I'm looking up to you in awe.  That's not the dynamic we're having...

I think I do know the difference between natural and accrued rights, thanks for your concern.  

It's this schizophrenic thought process that's leaped AGAIN into something else.  We started this about immigration, then you said no the point was really about social housing, then it was that social housing was to be used as an analogy in conjunction with LGBT...now you're leaping again into the nature of rights.  You're really not showing much consistency.

The first four paragraphs whilst simplistically right, are not relevant at all.  It's 'by that token' before you make a point:

&gt;**By that token, I cannot control where I was born, or who my grandparents were. I have no power over that decision, and it is part of who I am. What you’re proposing is an immediate penalty for something I can’t control and have no possibility of changing it unless I got back in time and re-invent my entire timeline.**

If someone loses a leg and is given a falsey, am I being penalised for something I haven't done when I too don't receive a false leg courtesy of the state?

Priotitising somebody does not mean punishing somebody else.  That's persecution complex right there.  We prioritise children too when it comes to social housing, or their guardians.  Are you going to claim persecution around ageism and progeny too?  It's not your fault what year you were born in, afterall.

How about the triage system in hospitals?  Are you going to claim persecution as you stand in A&amp;E with a broken toe as a doctor tries to massage a man's heart back into life on the grounds that you arrived first?  Or are you going to accept this isn't a matter of rights, and that you can prioritise without persecuting someone else.

You're next sentence is ludicrous when used in conjunction with this:

     ""Which is as implausible as asking an LGBT person not to be gay.""

There is absolutely no link here between protecting an existing family unit and connection, and not being able to do the same to someone else because they don't have that link, and any parallel with LGBT.

The exact same assessment can be applied to everybody, regardless of race, origin, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, county, north, south, west, east, and regardless how long they've been here as long as they qualify for social housing.

Regardless of who you are, if you are entitled to housing benefit and are looking for social housing then if you have any close-generation  family and ties in the country then we'll do what we can to put you near to your family.  This applies now, or if in 30-50 years time it is your own grandchildren and great grandchildren that want to be near you.

This isn't some grand persecution.  Nobody has a right to declare where there social housing will be.  What we will try to do is make it a best fit for all with the resources we have.

This is no rights issue.  It's certainly no LGBT parallel.

&gt;**The only way you could argue that preventing all British citizens from having those equal rights is then to argue that citizenship isn’t equal.**

It isn't a rights issue.  It's a privilege issue that you seem to be wrapped up in.   

You have no right to declare where your state afforded social housing will be.  I would have no right.  I can stand in the street stomping my feet like a child having a tantrum for all I want, but I have no right to social housing on the street of my choice.  No one does.  Citizenship is equal.

What they can then say is that regardless of the nature of your one size fits all citizenship, under which you receive housing benefit, is that they will distribute housing appropriately.  The three bedroom house to the couple with a child and a baby - without persecuting the single woman who only needs a bedsit.  The flat to the guy because it's closer to his work.  This apartment to that person because they have family links in the area.  You're not treated like a second rate citizen because you have less dependents, but you are assessed on the premise.  That too might be something out of your control.

It's not persecution, and it's not graded citizenship.

People all over the country receive massive variations in housing benefit because it's set by councils.  One person might be living in £50/week accommodation, another at £200/week, but we don't say that it's split level citizenship!

&gt;**But once you start including criteria that say my parents or grandparents have to be local to the area, then it becomes about a reality I cannot change. It becomes discrimination against my essential nature.**

You're very ego centric because for all you want to see this as a matter of rights, you've not once considered what's best for the grandparents.

&gt;**Oh and with regards to this** 

&gt;&gt;This emulsion thing 

&gt;**You mean conflation and I'm not conflating anything.**

No.  I meant 'emulsion'.  As in two things placed together which aren't soluble - like you bringing up LGBT right parallels in the middle of Social Housing discussion.

Your condescension is particular ill placed, and this is the third time you've tried it; from my perspecitve you're a bit of a conversational pygmy at the moment, with a somewhat schizophrenic thought process leaping from unconnected point to unconnected point.  Which is why I asked you to be a little more considered.

&gt;**My question on social housing is exactly that. No conflation involved.**

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"Sanctioning is not a solution to the problem though. It will not get people back into work, or 'incentivise' them to try harder. One thing it will most certainly do is give them a reason to stop trying.

A lot of these people wearing tracksuits as you described them, are the ones in need of help. They struggle to find work. They have no confidence in themselves, no prospects due to a lack of experience, qualifications or both and they probably don't see the point in looking for work anymore because their efforts thus far have been completely fruitless. 

I was severely depressed a few years ago when I was unemployed for a little under a year. During that time I made 250+ appications and didn't get a single interview, being rejected from places like Mcdonalds multiple times really sucks. When I walked into a job centre I was always on the defensive because people were judging me, assuming that I wasn't trying, and that made things a hundred times worse. Don't judge these people as that is part of the problem.

Work is a wonderful thing, it gives you a sense of pride and purpose, it gives you confidence and drive which gives you a stronger work ethic which stays with you. People who have never worked or have been out of work for a long period of time do not have this.

What they need is a kick start to get going. In times gone by, the Job Centre would submit CVs and arrange interviews for jobs or apprenticeships on behalf of businesses for suitable candidates (Which would be enough to boost confidence at least). They don't do this anymore, job seekers are on their own. When somebody described above walks into a job centre, they do not receive help that they need, so to them the only reason they are there is so the staff can try and catch them out, to sanction them, to judge them, to make them feel even more worthless than they already do.

The job centre is even making it harder these days, for instance they recently removed the customer phones from every job centre in the country. A lot of people relied on those to contact employers and now they have to rely on expensive pay as you go mobiles (Which usually people must have in order to recieve calls - but now they have to spend what little money they have topping it up too).

Now obviously there are a minority who are cheating the system (0.7% I think) who probably fit this same mold, but I think pigeonholing people is demeaning and dehumanising. Sanctioning them ontop of this is ludicrous, it's punishing the helpless. If somebody seems to be not looking for work or struggling to find work the Job Centre should try to engage them to find out why, then identify what further help they need.

Sorry for the long post, it just hit a nerve as you pretty much described me 4 years ago (Unpresentable appearance, not making eye contact due to being defensive etc.).",0,1400155401,null,0,1400155990,0,chijtpm,t3_25kpxs,t1_chijtpm,t1_chiinnx,null,1433806320,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

The front page of your website is looking much  neater now that you have removed all the multicoloured font, the black and blue is very  smart.

I have a suggestion regarding the picture categories on the front page: The idea of being able to click on pictures to take you to the categories is excellent, but I don't think categorising by manufacturer is useful for most customers, because people are very unlikely to be thinking ''I would like a Hotpoint, I don't care if it's a fridge or a washing machine, but I want a Hotpoint!'' ... they are most likely looking for a specific type of appliance, so it would be best to use the picture categories for each type of appliance.

Also, I noticed someone else suggested that you remove the model numbers from the bolded descriptions of each item, and I would like put forward a couple of good reasons for keeping those model numbers with top priority display: firstly, it makes your company look more professional, like you know what you are talking about ... if you went to a website looking for a car, you might not have much confidence in a company which described a car as ''Ford'' ... and secondly, if someone is comparing prices of washing machines with a list of normal showroom prices, they need to know the model number for quick reference if they are comparing a whole page of washing machines, without having to click on each one individually to find the model number.",0,1400155738,null,0,false,0,chijwgp,t3_25gy95,t1_chijwgp,t3_25gy95,null,1433806357,1,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,1

Unless you spent some time with them. Then you'd eventually find out that my sister is mentally handicapped and one of her children is profoundly deaf and requires a lot of help.

You automatically assume the worst of people, it seems. I don't think any of this would bother you if you weren't so uncharitable and judgemental. Everyone I have heard speak in this way seems to have a deficit of compassion or, perhaps, has just not been introduced to the difficulties of life on welfare.

Even if there are scroungers, it doesn't actually matter. An element of wastage is inherent in any enterprise, and 0.7% is pretty good. It's certainly better than the more significant issue of pensioners who are taking the maximum state pension on top of generous private pensions.

For me, of course, I wholeheartedly approve of people being on benefits as - by around 2030 to 2040, around half of the country's population will probably be dependent on benefits to survive.

I work on automation systems and, despite the blathering of economists, we are not seeing an increase in jobs for people as a result of automation, just an increased opportunity for more automation as a result of previous automation. The majority of jobs still treat employees as replaceable components and are, therefore, ripe for automation. Even high-level jobs are not immune from the current new crop of decision-making systems that are beginning to replace mid and high-level management. I would estimate that, by 2040, the majority of corporations will be run by learning systems, with human directors acting as nothing more than figureheads. 

The danger is more acute in the UK as we are dependent on the financial sector, an industry at the forefront of automation. A number of firms are already replacing high-level decision makers with learning systems, and - of course - utilising every technical advantage for HFT, while slashing expensive analysts and managerial jobs.

Most scientific R&amp;D firms now also rely on 'brute force' systems (an over-simplification) to plan or even perform experiments and develop new products because the sheer depth and breadth of data we are accumulating is simply too much for humans to process efficiently. Models &amp; simulations to constrain and inform these systems are improving markedly.

So, you might want to reconsider the primacy of work in the 21st century, because there's a whole industry that is growing extremely fast that aims to eradicate it.

Depending on how the law is drafted and the licensing scheme is designed (for example simply ruling all aiguns as ""section1"" firearms) a possible consequence is that folk will buy significantly more powerful airguns seeing as how they are going to have to go through the whole licensing rigmarole anyway.

Here's the problem I am having:

I say ""This shouldn't even be a discussion because black is not white""

Folks keep coming back with ""You don't know black isn't white. Sometimes black is white. That's why we have to make it illegal for black to be white.""

But here's the part where I think someone has seriously lost the plot: Torture *was* illegal while the Bush Administration was torturing prisoners. As was often pointed out, Japanese guards were sentenced to death for waterboarding prisoners post-WWII. There was zero doubt in anyone's mind that torture was illegal. 

Yet they did it anyway. 

So - we've *tried* ""let's make torture illegal"" and it didn't work. I fail to see why everyone suggests it will work next time. 

For those of us who believe in the rule of law - we're not going to torture. That's pretty much a done deal. What's necessary now is to attack mentalities like those in the original article - people who say that maybe torture *should* be legal in a ""ticking bomb scenario."" Socialise the message that after (or before) everything else, all torture does is give sadists an excuse to do what they want to do. 

Because if basic humanity or the rule of law isn't going to work, then for God's sake maybe these neandertals will listen to reason. 

And if, after I have presented a litany of reasons why a) torture doesn't work, and b) non-destructive interrogation does, people still want to suggest that I don't understand that sometimes black is white, I fail to see how these people think *anything* will dissuade sadists who need to believe that there's a good reason to hurt people.

true,TheMemo,cnty-uk,Bristol,"&gt; But given that over 1/3 of people on the sick when the Conservatives were in power, are now off the sick and in work, suggests that it was at least 33%.

We don't know that they are in work, just that they are off benefits. I know several people who were sanctioned for being too ill to attend their meetings. One of whom was in hospital at the time and then discovered that they had no money, no housing benefit, and became homeless. Thankfully they had friends to support them, but if they hadn't, it could have been disastrous.

Do not assume that these people were unfairly claiming, as the system currently attacks the most vulnerable first, even when they have an army of doctors and social support people willing to speak on their behalf.

Some of these people simply do not have the strength to deal with the welfare system as it now stands, and are reliant on friends and family to help them. They are most certainly not in work, nor could ever be. 

If you could see the despair and struggles of a couple I know as they try to get the benefits they are entitled to, having an autistic son who needs constant care, you might not consider meeting these targets to be a prime concern. It has taken them almost a year of constant hassles, mistakes and lack of communication from the various offices to be able to claim, having to live on their meagre savings and the husband's job in the meantime. If they weren't able to borrow from family, they would not be able to afford their rent, even though they should be paid housing benefit, are entitled to it, but are still waiting for it. In fact, the very fact that they have not been made homeless has been used as a reason why their housing benefit claim has been delayed for so long. Apparently, if you can borrow from your (still quite poor) family, this is a good enough reason to claim that you don't really need benefits at all.

Every day I see people struggling to deal with a system that is already combative and hostile, that pushes people into further poverty and debt, and you just want to make it worse.

&gt; This is a question for another day, however. Because I don't think even 0.7% of our current unemployed are so because of automation.

Possibly not. However, new job growth is stymied because of it. If a small or medium business wishes to grow, they come to a software development house first to find out if there is a way of changing their systems to obviate the need for more staff. A small security company I designed a system for, for example, would have had to employ 10 full-time workers a few years ago, now automation systems simply marginally increase (or, sometimes, decrease) the amount of work done by existing employees without having to employ more.

and sure.call my a conversational pygmie.. it's much better than being an intellectual one. 

Your examples demonstrate you don't understand the idea of human rights, which is a shame because if you don't understand human rights you really shouldn't be in the business of defending the LGBT policies of an organisation. 

Here's your first mistake:

&gt;now you're leaping again into the nature of rights. 

**All citizenship is about rights. All citizenship is a social contract between the society you live and the individual.**   This is the accepted definition of the relationship between state and person in the British and European philosophical tradition going all the way back to Hobbes. 

If you're going to support a part that's big on Britishness - I suggest you start with Hobbes and Locke.

You also don't understand the difference between enabling the individual to achieve equality and the prevention of it. If all citzens are equal than one of the key roles of society is to make sure that all citizens can reach that level of equality. 

Let's take you example of a person losing their legs. 

1) They *lost* their legs  and 2) the state gives them prosthetics.

The person wasn't born with loss of legs. Thus they have a deficit in their natural state imposed on them by circumstance. They could walk, now they can't. In this case when 1) happens the 2) is the state providing that person with the best approximation of delivering equality.  So deficit between a person who has the ability to walk and the person who doesn't is reduced by the state - this is what it means to be an equal citizen

However, if the state says that a person can't have prosthetics and should deal with it. It's CREATING a deficit between that person and their ability to achieve equality.  This means the state is instituting inequality of citizenship and discrimination. 

That's the difference. 

If a state decides to filter people on the right to a service because their grand parents weren't born there - it's creating a deficit in equality. That means citizenship is not equal. Therefore it's discrimination. 

If a B&amp;B owner decides to offer a service to the public and then stops gay people from taking part in that service. This is a deficit in equality becuase the service is not available to a person by dint of who they are. Again.. this is discrimination. 

You get the gist.. 

It's the same mechanism, same rights, same understanding of the model of universal human rights.  All the things you write about grand parents and everything else are externalities.

No, your point was an presumption that EEA and EFTA would be favoured more favourable than the EU.  You've flipped, AGAIN.

Essentially what we're still talking about is people more informed in general.

&gt;Furthermore, the respondents had to read one paragraph long summary of the EEA/EFTA/EU before taking the poll. A GCSE student could tell you why that's a bad idea.

Most referendums, polls and questions come with precisely this.

It's a majority and much closer to the trend, which is not what you were trying to project.  When you factor these majorities into don't knows and not likely to vote then the trend approaches something more akin to 2:1.  

And remember, this is for the state now which isn't really on the cards.  Ever closer union, more talk of federalism, a reform treaty, and another stage of the crisis just around the corner - all add up to exit ammunition.

Remember that an interest rate change isn't just a one-time event, it can often create signals of what will happen in the future. So a 0.25% rise is not significant in itself but, if this creates expectations that further rises will come, then the effect can be much bigger. 

However: other factors come into play. For example, a lot of demand in London apparently comes from foreign nationals buying properties. Since they normally don't rely on mortgages (cash buyers) they are unaffected by rate changes. 

Also just bear in mind that a rate change could affect your borrowing capacity. Lenders now have to factor in future rate rises to assess whether or not you can afford the mortgage. So if it is tight now and they factor in a future 1% rise on top of the actual 0.25% rise in 12 months time then they may lend you less.",0,1400158141,null,0,false,0,chikilr,t3_25mbxe,t1_chikilr,t3_25mbxe,null,1433806647,4,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,4

&gt;Again I can only believe this is because you're too lazy to actually apply for a license, I see no other reason to oppose this.

No its because I don't see that a government should introduce undue regulation and interference into peoples lives unless there is a clear and demonstrable need to do so. Absolutely nothing you've said so far has come anywhere close to showing that. I have in the past had a shotgun licence so no, I'm not ""too lazy"" to apply for one.

Let me put it another way then, martial arts are designed to hurt people. Lots of people do them for other reasons, but their primary core function is to inflict harm and incapacitate other people. Lots of people with martial arts training have in the past used that training to inflict damage on other people. So would you support licencing before learning any sort of martial art?

Background
 
FA710 Genetic engineering will not solve the problems created by industrialised agriculture and it may add to them. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) tend to secure large profits for a few multinational companies, rather than making farming easier or more efficient. 
 
FA711 Many environmental problems have been associated with genetically modified (GM) crops:
 
(a) GM crops may cross-breed with wild varieties or wild species and transfer genes to other plants, posing a long-term threat to wildlife and biodiversity.
 
(b) Herbicide-resistant genes have been transferred to other plants, creating ‘super weeds’.
 
(c) Herbicides used with GM crops have been shown to harm both wildlife and human health.
 
(d) GM crops producing bio-pesticide toxins may be toxic to wildlife and encourage resistance in the target species.
 
(e) GM crops undermine organic and conventional farming through cross-contamination and by creation of resistant pests. 
 
FA712 The use of GM crops in poor countries has proved disastrous to farming communities. Not only have the crops failed in many cases, but they undermine the diversity of local seed varieties with monoculture GM crops designed to secure profits for multinational biotechnology companies. There is no evidence that GM crops will ‘solve’ the problem of world food shortages through increased productivity: there are many social and economic issues that need to be addressed to prevent food shortages in poorer countries. (See also ST362, ST370)
 
FA713 Despite widespread introduction of GM foods in the United States and elsewhere, the potential dangers of GM foods to human health have not been properly investigated and risks remain considerable.
 
Policies
 
FA720 The Green Party supports a moratorium on the use of GMOs in all agricultural systems including production of human food and animal feed and on importation of GM food or feed. (See AR413, CC254, EU489 and ST364) 
 
FA721 We define GM food as any:
 
(a) that is genetically modified or includes ingredients from genetically modified crops; or
 
(b) that is from genetically modified animals; or
 
(c) that is from animals that have been fed genetically modified feed.
 
So long as any such food is available in this country, it must be labelled as containing genetically modified ingredients or coming from genetically modified sources. 
 
FA722 The Green Party will establish and uphold the rights of consumers, farmers and local authorities to choose GM-free food and to establish GM-free zones. We will legislate for a strict liability regime which makes biotech (GM seed) companies and GM food producers fully liable for any losses through contamination or harm caused to the environment or human health. (See ST364) 
 
FA723 We will apply the precautionary principle and place strict conditions on research using genetic engineering to ensure that GMOs do not escape, pollinate other plants or cause other damage. (See ST363)

MEP elections in England use the [D'Hondt method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method), which is a kind of PR whereby voters vote for a Party, and then seats are allocated in proportion to the votes.

For example, at the last election the Conservatives got 35%, UKIP 19%, Lib Dems 14%, Greens 12%, Labour 8% of the vote. That turns into 4/40 seats for the Conservatives, 2/20 for UKIP [1 of whom defected to the Conservatives], 2/10 for the Lib Dems, 1/10 for Greens and 1/10 for Labour.

Unlike other elections people vote for the Party not the candidate, and so Parties put forward as many candidates as they can under their Party name (up to the maximum available), the candidates are listed in order of preference, and so if the Party wins *x* seats, the first *x* listed candidates are elected.

From what I can tell, the following Parties are standing in the South East;

| Party | No of candidates |
|:---|:---|
| [An Independence from Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Independence_from_Europe) | 10

Given the political situation, I think at best we might see a swing of one seat from the Lib Dems to UKIP, perhaps one from the Conservatives as well (recovering their defector).

As an individual voter it is hard to stop UKIP getting in (that's one of the advantages of PR; it is harder to vote tactically - you have to vote for a party, not against another one). Based on the last results, voting Green might be best, as they had the highest votes per seat count (so more votes might tip them over into having another one). Alternatively, voting Lib Dem might help them keep at least one of their seats, not losing both of them to UKIP or the Conservatives.",0,1400161293,null,0,false,0,chili7q,t3_25m71t,t1_chili7q,t1_chil0xg,null,1433807116,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

Hang on, you're the one that brought condescension into this from the offset, wasted half a post explaining something that wasn't relevant, and then tried to conflate it with different subjects.

&gt;Your examples demonstrate you don't understand the idea of human rights,

Get this into your head.  Nobody has the right to social housing where and when and to the manner they demand.  You do not have a right to social housing wherever you deem best for you.  Local authorities have a duty to allocate accordingly as per their means as they are assessed.

Mixing this up with LGBT rights is nonsensical.

&gt;**All citizenship is about rights. All citizenship is a social contract between the society you live and the individual.** 

Agreed.

But you've shoehorned that into this policy on allocation of social housing where it does not belong.

&gt;If you're going to support a part that's big on Britishness - I suggest you start with Hobbes and Locke.

You're off on another fourth tangent.  Which is fine, I'll address that now too if you want.   I prefer Rousseau, thanks all the same.

&gt;You also don't understand the difference between enabling the individual to achieve equality and the prevention of it. If all citzens are equal than one of the key roles of society is to make sure that all citizens can reach that level of equality.

And indeed this policy on social housing does just that.  Nobody makes a person move away from their family.  If one person chooses it then fair enough, but to then pressure another who has not chosen it to make parity with those that have is not promoting equality rather self-entitlement of one's choice over another.

&gt;The person wasn't born with loss of legs

How do you know?

For the sake of this premise let's say they were.  See, now the analogy works again.

&gt;However, if the state says that a person can't have prosthetics and should deal with it. It's CREATING a deficit between that person and their ability to achieve equality. This means the state is instituting inequality of citizenship and discrimination.

Which is not what we do.  We recognise a right to healthcare but we don't mandate that everybody gets the same treatment regardless of their condition, rather it is tailored to them.

Much as social housing is already tailored, and all this policy proposal does is to suggest an aspect of tailoring without crossing anyone's rights.

&gt;If a state decides to filter people on the right to a service because their grand parents weren't born there - it's creating a deficit in equality. That means citizenship is not equal. Therefore it's discrimination.

But that's not what this policy does.

This policy prioritises local housing for people with local links.  That doesn't mean somebody else goes without a claim on housing, only that they won't be prioritised for a certain locality.

I told you at the very beginning that you had approached this with an inaccurate presumption, and there it is.

&gt;It's the same mechanism, same rights, same understanding of the model of universal human rights. All the things you write about grand parents and everything else are externalities.

Newsflash:

You, nor anybody else, has a right to live in social housing in a specific location of your choice.  Local authorities might try their best to make the best fit for you using the limited resources they have, but a citizen's right to housing or housing benefit is not the same thing as a right to dictate exactly where, nor does it mean you are being discriminated against if the nature of the housing allocated is assessed.

You conflated rights with allocation of social housing into a hotchpotch *emulsion*, and tried to draw false parallels to LGBT rights where it did not belong.

We prioritise social housing allocation based on many fields already, and it does not create second tier citizenship as you tried to argue. This simply introduces another field to the assessment, one which can be applied equally to all citizens.

You don't have to like the policy.  You can argue it is a crude means of implementation, but it certainly isn't an encroachment on rights.  Not by any stretch.",0,1400161758,null,0,false,0,chilo4y,t3_25j2wq,t1_chilo4y,t1_chik938,null,1433807189,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

in games lucas has played 45 or more minutes, we've won 12 games, lost 6, drew 3, scored 43 goals and conceded 31 goals.

in the 17 games he played less than 45 minutes, we won 13, lost 0, drew 3, scored 57 and conceded 19. (i am not sure about this one, looks like he said 17 games but i see only see 16 results)

2.6 points per game when he plays less than 45 

1.8 points per game when he plays 45 or more

1.4 more goals a game without him in the team

we give up more goals with him in it.

ground duels won in the low 30's.

he isnt mobile like he was before and he cant cover the fullbacks anymore. then you add in he's on really high wages. and that rodgers loves versatile players, and lucas can really only perform in one role. but keep living in 2011 if it makes you happy.

""bedroom tax"" is a nickname given to a benefit cut. Basically, if you had 3 children and rented a 4 bedroom house which you paid for with housing benefit, and then 2 of those grown up children left home to start their own families, the gov/ council would not keep paying you the same rate to house your family. They would take some off your housing benefit to encourage you to find a 2 bed house and free up the 4 bed house for a large family who are overcrowded. 

This does not affect homeowners or people who pay their own rent, and it only affects people on housing benefits if they cannot afford to pay for their spare room out their own pockets.

Where the policy falls down as that it does not take into account people who need a spare room for genuine reasons, say they are ill and need a carer (i dont think kids grown up and at uni only coming back 1 weekend every 3 months is a valid reason to have a spare bedroom). 

To add: the bedroom tax (or housing benefit cut) wasnt very popular when it first came in but i feel that was more down to implementation than the principle of the idea. They brought it in over night and did not give people who were happy to down size the chance to do so. Also most council housing and associations have rules where they will not move tenants who are in any debt, so it became a bit of a vicious circle. Alot of people agree with the principle though, why should a couple live in a nice 4 bed house and have it paid for by the state when most people cant afford to buy a house to adequately suit their needs, or struggle to find a house big enough for a large family to rent when there were many sitting under-occupied.

I think it would have a temporary effect. It will force some people to sell and make buy to let less profitable. This would reduce prices as more people try to sell at the same time.

The reason I think this is temporary is because we have had 30 years of undersupply, ever since Maggie forced councils not to use ""right to buy"" profits to build new homes. Combined with a population increase in London, this means that you are almost guaranteed tenents, and foreign landlords will jump on it.

As for how much rates go up - if it is down to the government, that will be very small, perhaps 1 - 2%. If it is down to something out of the government's control (such as sterling value crisis, bank collapses or a political crisis) the rises could be suddenly high like the 17% rate seen in the early 90s.
