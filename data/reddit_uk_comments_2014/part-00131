true,dirtyewok,num26,,"&gt; It's in the phrasing a little, instead of seeing it as making it easier for English players to play, some will see it as English players being given more of a chance than they currently are.
&gt; In the current system a cheap, experienced foreigner is more likely to get a game than an English player who is still developing. This developing talent may have to drop down a division in order to get a game, which means a lower standard of coaching and ultimately a player not reaching his early potential.

But by giving a English player a better chance than someone from a different country, ultimately it is the same result. You are not making a decision on quality.

If a player, regardless of nation, can't cut it in the PL then that is the best thing. Only the very best should be playing in the league.  

Now as for a young player dropping down a level for game time that is the perfect example of why the FA should encourage players/teams to look abroad for options.  If dropping down to the Championship or League 1 is detrimental to development because of lower standard of coaching then why are teams not trying to get these players out to other leagues?

Surely an talented English player with upside would be able to cut it at a higher level in another country be it loan or permanent. If you feel your young talented player is being wasted because he isn't playing with the first team and you don't think he is getting the competition at the lower levels then why aren't teams looking to send players out to Spain, France, Germany, Italy?

If a player is too good for the championship but can't break first team it makes more sense to get him out to a Sampdoria, Elche or Werder Bremen (chosen at random). He gets the advantages of playing in a competitive league with higher level training.

It shouldn't be a case of creating more chances or making it easier for English players....it should be a case of making sure the absolute best talent is in the PL and then using all possible avenues (even if that means having players leave England) to improve the talent base. Only by keeping the highest level of competition and making all teams strive for the best talent can you really foster a situation where the English talent pool improves.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"I think implying that Islam is being forced upon everyone because companies make the choice to use Halal meat is a bit of a stretch. It's a very weak argument unless you practice a religion that explicitly states that Halal meat is not allowed (I'll give you a hint, there are exactly no religions that do this).

The issue is an economic one more than a religious one. With non-Halal meat, businesses found they were blocking out a large portion of the market and losing potential sales. Halal meat caters to Muslims, whilst also catering to Christians and those with no religion who form the majority of the population, which means the businesses can reach the largest proportion of the population. You see, Christians and atheists aren't bound to eat non-Halal meat, it doesn't affect them at all, which means they this doesn't affect their religious freedom.

It kind of sucks if you are Jewish as Halal meat is unlikely to be Kosher, but then again there are more Muslims than Jews in the UK so again it's a simple case of the number of potential customers.

It doesn't change the nature or taste of the meat either, and as pointed out in other comments, there are far less humane practices involved in the meat industry (In the case of Chickens, boiling them in water to remove their feathers is far less humane), so that argument would be kind of moot as well. To somebody with no connection to Islam, it shouldn't be considered a ritual of any sort, it's just another way of slaughtering the animal in the preparation for human consumption.

Religion doesn't even come into it for these businesses, it is almost purely an economic decision to be able to cater for the most customers. It shouldn't affect you as a customer as the product you are getting is exactly the same whether it's Halal or not.

2) Always really liked Juan Mata and have never liked Rooney's attitude. Actual dislike though? I don't think I dislike any of the players more than the club itself.
3) I have enjoyed the club's investment in itself and the youth policy. Also much of the success needs to be shared between Pochettino and Adkins before him, the long time players like Lambert, Lallana, Schneiderlin, etc, and the former front office regime (despite what everyone says about him now). 
4) I think Shaw might leave but I think Lallana will stay. I think the media is generally full of it, though.
5) I think Pochettino could take us to Champions League if he was given better players...particularly another finisher or two, as well as the obvious needs for CB and depth at a number of positions. Pochettino is the not the issue with the club.

5. Queen Elizabeth explicitly appointed the Doctor ""Curator of the Undergallery"" in her letter.  

6. Osgood doesn't seem very impressed with 11, yet she's completely obsessed with the Doctor.  Why? Because she already sees the older/wiser curator Doctor on a daily basis...and he's probably the one who gave her the scarf.

7. Kate Stewart had the TARDIS picked up because ""she didn't know the Doctor was still in it"".  Why would she think that?  Maybe because she had recently seen the curator and had no reason to believe that there were 2 Doctors around at the same time.  The curator went off somewhere in his own TARDIS while the undergallery events happened and she settled for getting help from 11.


Do you have any reason to think that there is a human who looks like 4 and knows enough about aliens and alien technology to be curator of the Undergallery, and happens to know about the Doctor's future?

Managers are under such pressure for results that they are unlikely to pick an unproven 20 year old over that 25 year old scouted and brought in from a Ligue 1 side in the last window.

As a result not enough academy players are even being given a chance to prove that they can potentially cut it in the Premier League. How will we know if a player is/can be the very best if he doesn't get a look in?

An example I can use is Nabil Bentaleb. If AVB had remained in charge there's a chance he wouldn't have seen a minute in the first team this season, but because he's been given a go a lot of us recognise he might actually have what it takes. He could have been loaned out or moved on in the summer but because he's had a chance, he's now considered by many to be a great prospect. How many other players at other Premier League clubs will never get that chance and be offloaded before they're even heard of?

The Daily Mail is the preferred paper here. Most common people make sure to read the ten-page spread on what Prince George has done today, of course not before saying their morning prayers for each member of the Glorious Family. 

Originally I had a rather prestigious job. However, since Her Majesty's most loyal Prime Minister David Cameron has introduced austerity, I now have a job managing the community mud pile. Each month I am obliged to give 75% of this and any profits to Her Majesty, so I barely have enough to live on at the moment. I am not unhappy with this however, for I am sure the profits will go to combating the monstrous French Republic, which threatens the shores of brave Britannia daily.

Of course, Britain has a massive overseas empire which also lives under the monarchy. Since I am not permitted to travel without her Britannic Majesty's permission, I have never been. The stories that filter back from the mighty trade centre of the Falkland Islands never cease to amaze me, nonetheless.

Everyone is happy here. There is no reason for your small nation to be scared, as long as they continue to send tribute.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"&gt; Why should a Christian eat meat that has been blessed by an Islamic prayer?

I guess we just have a difference in opinion here then, which is absolutely fine. I personally feel that as Halal meat doesn't impede other peoples religious beliefs, then there isn't a problem. If non-Halal meat is the standard, then that is impeding a large proportion of our population from practicing their beliefs whilst not facilitating anybody elses. Halal meat facilitiates the practice of religious views for a large proportion of the population, and doesn't impede others from practicing their own, which I think is the key factor here; Halal gives greater religious freedom than non-Halal.

I identify myself as having no religion. If I go into Subway for lunch, I couldn't care less that the meat is Halal. You can perform any prayer you like, if I don't believe in those religions, then that prayer is not going to do anything and is certainly not affecting me. I really don't see how it is a problem, but that's just me.

It's different if Halal becomes required by law, because then there is a problem (Not because I feel this would impede religious freedom, but because of the wider implications of merging church and state - I mean look at the abortion laws in some other Christian countries for example). That is the line that I feel it should not cross.

A start would be to engineer away the conflict that's normally built in. Generally speaking this would mean segregating different modes of transport. The UK already does this, it's the reason motorways are incredibly safe (motorway safety is what the linked article is based on). The road has one function, all users are similar and predictable, and the design is forgiving.

This separation of modes isn't done where it's needed most, particularly for cycling, on any other road. For people walking the separation tends not to be for them, but to keep them out of the way of cars, meaning routes are inconvenient and can feel really unsafe.

The way we build our roads is purely an engineering problem, something that we can design away with investment of time and will.

As to your initial op, can you counter the argument that public funded projects are more efficient with stats?

As an anecdote so not hard evidence, however I have seen this from both sides of the spectrum.

Story time.

There has been a lot of failed public funded IT projects in recent years, these projects where sourced and project managed by the public but they decided to put the project out to tender even though hiring internal would save money in the long run, internal beauracey meant that it missed the deadline and was paying cutting edge prices to be a year behind the curve and now lumbered with a system that needs external support.

The private sector meanwhile are looking for work, they see a tender from the public sector so go flying in with playing buzz word bingo because they see a cash cow, and if things go right they get a nice bonus. The devs meanwhile need defined parameters to work in, not to be told 2 months before launch after many UAT that a ""small"" fundamental change needs to be made which means putting in overtime..

Devil's advocate, but nobody forces you to watch a particular TV program, or read a particular newspaper, either

I think there should be a distinction between how the law handles something some nobody says on Twitter, versus something a newspaper publishes. But I don't think the distinction is that you don't have to listen, that is true for anything.

I think it is more down to the likely amount of influence they are going to have. The nobody on Twitter - almost none. The newspaper - potentially quite a lot. It is ridiculous to compare them in any way.

Of course then you have someone like Stephen Fry, who probably has more followers than all the newspapers put together.

I can understand the business side of the decision... but I simply don't agree with it. The reason Sir Alex was able to become the legend he was was because he was given the time to shape the entire club so it was 100% behind him (11th, 2nd, 11th, 13th, 6th were his first five seasons). I particularly found the attitude of some ManU fans to be quite disgusting - in a spoilt kind of way... and they were summed up by that fat ""Moyseh"" bloke who was interviewed on youtube. Despicable. I don't know enough about Van Gaal to form an opinion but without *significant* wholesale changes over the summer I feel it's inevitable that he won't do much better... and because of the spoilt, can't-see-further-than-this-year's-empty-trophy-cabinet, fans I will enjoy it if it does happen again.

Q2 - Never liked Rooney. He's a great player, but not world class... at his peak he *maybe* would've got on the subs bench of the World XI B team.

Q3 - Possession and pressing. We have one of the highest, if not THE highest, average possession rate in the league... and when we're not in possession we press and close down their midfield. At our match at Old Trafford we had 54% possession as well as more shots on and off target (not that you would've known that from the coverage on MOTD... grrr!).

These are the most important things to be on top of, since no savings interest you earn can beat debt interest you pay and if you're still spending more than you earn, you can only go further into debt. Even if these figures are negative, knowing them already makes you a financial literate compared to most people I've met.

If you have no debt and you earn more than you spend, then how long do you expect it to take to afford a house (e.g. reach £20k+). Depending on whether this is more or less than five years, investing might be better than saving. If you'll reach the deposit amount within three years, then there's nothing that beats 5%+ current accounts for your £6k lump-sum, even ISAs, though for your monthly savings you can get a 6% regular saver.

true,Badgerfest,,IPA,"I used to teach this stuff to military types, so here goes:

* Pick a subject you are enthusiastic and knowledgeable about.

* Split your time: 10% (1 min) for the introduction, 80% (8 min) for the middle bit, 10% (1 min) for the conclusion.  Aim to be within 10% of your target time (9 to 11 min).

* Don't introduce anything new in the introduction or conclusion: tell them what you are going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you've just told them.  It's a bit like an essay.

* Ask a question and come to some sort of conclusion.  They are unlikely to be interested in a list of facts, and will want to see some analysis of your subject.

* Introduction (2 slides): tell them who you are (put your name on the title slide), announce the title, tell them how long the presentation is, go through the scope of the presentation, ask them to keep questions until the end.

* Main body (3 to 6 slides): use a logical flow - start big then get small, start in the past and work to the future, tell the story from start to finish.

* Conclusion (2 slides): recite the scope of the presentation and announce your conclusion - what does your analysis tell you?

* Don't issue hand outs until after the presentation otherwise the audience will be distracted by shiny things.

* Look at the audience.  You don't need to make eye contact, but do look around the room.  Avoid walking in front of the projector.

* Aim your voice at the wall behind the audience so everyone can hear you, but you aren't too loud.

* Any more than 10 slides is an extravagance, aim for 7.

* Use bullet points as prompts, do not use walls of text.  Avoid animations.

* Choose your colours carefully, blue background and yellow/white text is what we typically use to prevent inducing seizures.  Check your slides on a projector if possible for the full effect, a computer screen will not give a realistic impression.

* If you use any diagrams or pictures make sure they are clear and keep them on the screen for long enough for the audience to read them.

* Use notes in the form of one line prompts on index cards.   Do not read from a script, you will sound boring and get lost in your notes at some point.

* Use simple language, it is easier for you and them.

* Have more information in your notes than you are going to present in case of questions.

* Try to avoid an IT faff.  Are you using their computer or yours?  Do they use the same version of powerpoint as you?  Will you be setting it up or will they do it for you?  Do they use a PC or a Mac?  Will you have a remote to click through slides or will you be using the keyboard?

* Stay calm - if you have an IT failure then try to fix it, but be prepared to do the presentation without the slides; your notes should be good enough for you to do this.  Have hard copies of important graphics just in case.

* If you slip up, correct yourself and move on.  It takes two seconds, but will seem like a lot longer than that.  Remember this and try not to get flustered if it happens.

* Be very careful with humour; if you're unsure, play it straight.

* Invite questions at the end.  Be honest, don't bullshit - if you don't know the answer admit it and promise to find out.

* Practice, practice, practice.  Practice in your head.  Practice in front of a mirror.  Practice in front of your friends/parents/girlfriend/wife/dog/hamster.  Put a video on YouTube so we can all provide feedback. Accept criticism, experiment with different approaches, but be natural.

* Check grammar, spelling and punctuation.  Get others to check your grammar, spelling and punctuation.

That's all there is to it!  Seriously if you need advice then let me know,

If you meet someone who looks like someone you know, do you ever say ""I never forget a face""? No.  You say that to someone you've met before.  And no, people can't look exactly the same except in the world of BBC where they recycle actors all the time.  This was NOT a case of the BBC recycling an actor.

You're saying that UNIT found some guy who looked like the Doctor, trained him in all things alien and made him Curator...because he looks like the Doctor.

&gt;The Doctor's diary, or some record of the Doctor's exploits. Again, this is UNIT we're talking about.

Since when does the Doctor have a diary? River Song had a diary, but it's stuck in the Library surrounded by Vashta Nerada in the 51st century. Even so, it likely only went part way through 11's lifetime.  UNIT does NOT have the ability to time travel, and the Doctor certainly wouldn't give them Jack's vortex manipulator that Clara took from the Black Archive.

&gt;He's REALLY old and has been taking care of a Doctor-themed museum for God knows how long. It doesn't have to mean anything. Another thing, scarf girl is his granddaughter; which means that she's a Time Lord too IF he's the Doctor. Nothing gave any indication that she (or he) was such.

REALLY old in Doctor Who is far greater than any human lifetime.  Even if this guy became Curator in his 20s, that's still only 50 or 60 years.  And who said that ""scarf girl""(Osgood) is his granddaughter?  She's probably the granddaughter of Tom Osgood, who served under the Brigadier.

Also how does he know that the painting's true name is ""Gallifrey Falls No More""?

Why did he specifically seek out the Doctor to tell him that?

How does he know that Gallifrey didn't fall?

Why doesn't the rest of UNIT know the painting's true name?

How did he acquire the painting?  Did he leave earth to do so?

Why is he being so evasive about telling the Doctor what he should do, if he's not a future Doctor who doesn't want to interfere too much with his own time line?

UNIT knows a lot relative to other humans but they know nothing about traveling through space and time.  How would they know anything about Gallifrey?

UNIT only knows what has happened until today.  They know nothing about the future.  ",0,1399584560,null,0,false,0,chd2i3i,t3_251gc2,t1_chd2i3i,t1_chd0u1v,null,1433711657,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

However, you're right, the stats don't actually show the full picture. So to answer your question as detailed as possible:

Yes, yes he is.

There we go.  
  

Anyway, to actually answer your question: He really is brilliant. Lallana outshines most of the Southampton squad with his movement, control, passing and generally being awesome, while also giving other teams trouble with his ability both on and off the ball. He can make killer runs, can play killer passes, he shows ridiculous composure on the ball. May get tackled when trying a dribble or two but who doesn't? His successful dribbles can take players out of the game entirely, which coupled with his passing can lead to a big threat to defences. Can hit a ball with both feet when he gets the chance, though he's not done it as much in the last couple of seasons as he did in the seasons when we were down (probably due to less time on the ball from defences etc) but just look at his goals vs Hull and vs Newcastle this year to see what he can do.

In a team that finished 8th he has been the stand out player, including against teams above us, up to and including all of you fuckers that beat us, he'd still be pretty outstanding most of the time. He can occasionally get marked out of a game when focused, but so can anyone as you should be all to aware from park-the-bus teams, or the fact that Suarez has to pull off some brilliance to find space. I have no doubt he'd handle the Champions League, he's handled every step up he's ever given, and I don't think he looked out of place in his England performances, even when everyone else played like shit. As for the price tag, that's for 3 reasons: He's English, he's in the form of his life, and we don't need to sell, so it'd have to be a good offer to get him to leave. Also don't forget he's our captain, and has been playing with us since 2006 and has over 250 appearances for us, so at present he's as close a club legend as you can get. If he leaves it'll be like Stevie G leaving you guys. He's that important.

Also the constant barrage of images of sexualised woman has made girls even more conscious about their appearance than before (A friend of mine is a phycologist who works with teenage girls and she says that self harm and anorexia in girls is shooting up). Basically we've become a more sexualised culture and it's hit women hardest.

I'm less sure about some of the inferences made, that men hate women because they have jobs and want to be in traditional men's spaces (in the main). However, I think there is some resentment when there is too much positive discrimination to get women into 'male areas'.

1. Mourinho is the only man for the job. Disagreeing with this isn't just a difference in opinion, its a sign that you're a clueless, post-2012 plastic who doesn't deserve the right to offer written thought on the subject.

2. Torres is shit. Not ""good movement"", not ""hard working"", not ""tries hard for the team"", not ""creates space for other players"", he's just shit. Fucking shit.

3. 90% of your opinions on youth players are complete bullshit. You cry about Bamford, Chalobah and McEachran not getting a chance to play and develop, yet when Salah has a bad game (someone around the same age) you scream that he isn't good enough and should never have been signed. You also talk about Lukaku like he's the biggest pile of shit in the world. Sure, he's not good enough yet. He's also only just gotten out of his fucking teens and is nowhere near his prime. It seems we're all patient and caring of those miles away from reaching the first team and impatient and overly harsh of those close to breaking through.

4. You don't know the subtleties of managing a premiership club, so don't act like you do. I've played, watched and followed football religiously from the day I was born, and I don't know 1% of what Mourinho knows. You newcomers who have watched from abroad since we won the CL know even less. Bare that in mind before you post your novel on Mourinho's tactical failings and your easy-fix solution.

5. Mata is not a club legend.

6. Poyet is not a club legend.

7. If you sympathise or get on with Liverpool fans for whatever reason you aren't a proper fan or even a proper human being. If I see one more ""Gerrard deserved the title I feel bad for him"" from someone with a Chelsea crest I'm going to start throwing punches.

8. If you're American don't use an England flair on here. Its just pathetic.

9. Defensive football is dope as fuck. I don't think that we play overly conservative as a whole anyway, but even if we did I wouldn't care.

10. We're a hated club (on this site especially). When we lose we're going to get a ton of stick so when we succeed we have every right to be as insufferable as possible. Don't tell me to be respectful of Wenger's 1000 game legacy after we spank them 6-0. Respect is for children.

How many times did we all cringe watching our players cluster around the box, refusing to make runs and simply crowding each other out, then dish a pass out to Ivanovic to play in a cross to no one? I honestly can't count. We cannot put this down to not having creative players because in the first half of the season and even today we are blessed with a great crew of skilled AMs that any of our league rivals would love to have at their disposal. This problem has to do with what they are being instructed to do and clearly it doesn't work.

Counter-attacking is great and so is pragmatic tactics. Despite Liverpool scoring so many goals, our goal difference is within striking distance. At some point, though, we can't rely on every team taking the fight to us; we will have to beat teams by being attacking at some point.

Mourinho will ruin all the work Chelsea has done with their squad and academy by the time his second tenure is over. The squad will be filled with overachieving players that ""work hard"" and fit his style. While only rumors, Hazard being unhappy with the style and eventually leaving would be devastating. Hazard might be most skillful player Chelsea has signed in the past 10 years. I do not believe he is leaving next season, but if the the style of play continues, I can see him wanting to leave.

I do not like Chelsea reverting back to a hyper defensive style of football. There is a difference between counter-attacking and parking the bus. City away, that was counter-attacking and it was beautiful. Atheltico away, that was parking the bus and it was boring. That being said, why should Chelsea automatically revert go a defensive style on big matches? Why should we not go for the goals?

Mourinho stated that he had no choice but to go back to a more defensive side because they were giving up goals. But, it was not like Chelsea looked great attacking anyway. In fact, the results were the same. Chelsea gained a total of 2 points compared to the first half.

Mourinho is a brilliant defensive tactician. But, he offers very little as far as attacking goes. They played the exact same way against the clubs that parked the bus, obviously it did not work. People might point out what he did in RM. I take any scoring records in Spain and throw them out. Very different league who focuses on style which suites a counter attacking squad.

Mourinho, amongst other things, was fired because of the style of football Chelsea played. Now, Chelsea played the exact same way. At this rate, I do not see Mourinho lasting more than 2 seasons.

Edit:

In addition, this threat by the Taxi trade is completely unacceptable. London Taxis have traditionally been at war with Private Hire Vehicles, but holding the city hostage isn't right. PHV operations are fair and square, and part of normal business practice.

Personally, I don't see why London Taxis have such a gripe with PHV's. I've been a Licensed Driver for 5 years now, a portion of which was Private Hire. Almost everywhere outside of London, Taxis and PHV's work in the same system, functioning as the system intended. Infact, a lot of firms (like the one I work for), has both taxis and PHV's working for them.

1) This same argument could be made for any number of goods and services. For example, producers of food enable the persistence of human life in general, and thus by extension 'economic participation and job creation' too. It seems to me that the policy conclusion ""subsidise it!"" cannot possibly follow from this observation (alone, at least). 

2) This is a fair argument for subsidisation, and it has some sway over me. However, the problem always remains that subsidisation beyond a certain point could move us from one inefficiency (too few buses) to the opposite (too many). It requires calculations of these hidden costs to internalise the costs, which can only be done to a spurious precision as far as I am aware. 

3) I sympathise with what you are saying. I would probably only favour a very gradual removal of subsidisation (so perhaps the buses came less frequently and became more expensive slowly over time). That way people would have time at least to factor in these changes to their situation. 

4) Fair point, though I think the subsidies *mostly* are to the benefit of those people living very far out from the city, i.e., people in the countryside. ",0,1399587790,null,0,1399592376,0,chd3zwl,t3_25178x,t1_chd3zwl,t1_chcuvkt,null,1433712361,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If people think it's inhumane to slaughter animals without stunning (as 15% of halal meat is.) then why is it so crazy for them to want to avoid that?
Just as a vegetarian would avoid meet completely due to an opinion on the humanity of meat.

Or if a person wishes to avoid religious teachings, religious practice and religion as a whole due to holding atheistic/anti-religion values, then how is that any less a valid opinion than a bloke who says he wants his meet to be cut alongside a prayer?

Don't get me wrong, I understand why it makes business sense for places to go with halal over other meet, I'm not against it. I'm not even sure I'd expect places to clearly tell customers that their meet is or is not halal/kosher - if you hold an opinion that it matters then it's down to you to find out. I'm allergic to milk which is literally a matter of life and death at it's worst, and yet I still have to go out of my way to find out what's in food sold down the local pub - never complained about it either.

true,widgetas,null,null,"I imagine that the groups that are protected enjoy that protection due to numerous historical (or otherwise) actions against them for the very reason that they have that quality.

It's possible to add to the categories, of course. A perhaps tenuous example might be with regard to what some might call ""life-style"" choices: ['murdered for being a goth'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Sophie_Lancaster). But other than examples like that, there's every chance that if the case is made following a series of attacks on ginger people, that ginger folk will get similar protections.

Small note though, as you mentioned ""insulting people"": I'm not sure that people can be prosecuted for ""insulting"" any longer. [Not since the reform of Section 5](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-21020737). You might be conflating hate speech/insulting language/""people being 'offended'""? Or not - it might be a mis-speak! 

With regard to the latter point there, very often it seems that when something like this comes to court and someone is imprisoned, many people think that it was because ""someone was offended and complained"". Consider the Tom Daley case a few years back: the media didn't help in that they emphasised that a ""man was arrested after tweeting to Tom Daley that he had let his dad down"". While technically that was true - he *was* arrested in the period after he'd tweeted those things - [the guy was actually arrested for making a death threat, telling Daley he was going to drown him in a pool](http://i.imgur.com/XWRXf.png). Much of the conversations following this ran along the lines of how wrong it was that he was arrested just for being nasty about Daley's dad. That was never the case, and the issue of ""offense"" was never the important aspect. Very often it isn't, so far as I can tell.

Put a limit in how many none English players you have. In the premier league, U-21 doesn't count in this quota. In the B team, make it U-17, this way they will count towards being HG at the end. Maybe we can get a boost with the national team as an effect.

You doubt women are subjected to more online abuse than men, even though you just watched an entire BBC documentary showing that this is NOT true. You ask for evidence but please re-watch the documentary, there are several discussions with professors on it. 

and 

2) the abuse they receive is more damaging as it is sexual in nature. Yes, you're right that women are abused differently. 

Do you think racist comments are equally as sexual (they're not). The show talks about the fact that sexist comments are, more often than not, sexually abusive in nature, and this means that sexist comments are usually more damaging than other abusive comments towards other communities or minorities because it enables sexist behaviour and therefore abuse such as sexual assault. 

The reason the whole show was important is because women are 50% of the population, but they suffer more from sexual abuse, domestic violence ect. The reason the show focused on the internet and technology was to see if it has normalised this sexist abuse so that it doesn't even appear as a problem anymore, which clearly it is.

Leicester supporters storming onto the pitch at  Filbert Way after they secure 7th in dramatic fashion. The absolute suspense of the Championship Playoff Final, pitting QPR in 10th position against 12th position Brighton. Can Brighton secure promotion amidst a meager 66 point campaign? 

Not to mention all the clubs that get bumped to a lower league to make way for these 6 clubs, and the sudden vacuum of talent and TV revenue that they would cause. How about the fact that a mid table Championship club can be promoted to Premiership? I'm sure Palace fans would relish Brighton's trouncing each week if they were to secure promotion, but would it be good for the league? No, it wouldn't.  

It will be better for the tops clubs, including Spurs, but bad for English football as a whole.

&gt;

&gt;___Scream of the Shalka___ is a [flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromedia_Flash)-animated series based on the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. It was produced to coincide with the 40th Anniversary of the series and was originally posted in six weekly parts from 13 November to 18 December 2003 on [bbc.co.uk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bbc.co.uk)'s *Doctor Who* [website](http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/doctorwho/webcasts/shalka/).

&gt;Although *Scream of the Shalka* was intended to be an official continuation [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] of the television series that had ended in 1989, as well as the 1996 television movie, the revival of the program in 2005 relegated it, and [its Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalka_Doctor), to non-canon status. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] The series was scripted by veteran *Doctor Who* writer [Paul Cornell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Cornell), with [Richard E. Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Grant) providing the voice for the Ninth Doctor. This performance followed years of rumours that Grant would play [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)) in a film or new series, and indeed he had appeared as the ""Conceited Doctor"" in the Comic Relief special *[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_and_the_Curse_of_Fatal_Death)* in 1999. Grant subsequently went on to appear in the revived television series of *Doctor Who* as a guest villain in 2012's ""[The Snowmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snowmen)"" and 2013's ""[The Bells of Saint John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bells_of_Saint_John)"" and ""[The Name of the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Doctor)"". The Doctor's companion for this adventure, [Alison Cheney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_spin-off_companions#Alison_Cheney), was voiced by [Sophie Okonedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Okonedo) who a year later would be nominated for an [Academy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards) for her performance in *[Hotel Rwanda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Rwanda)*. She also appeared in the [2010 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(2010_series\)) of *Doctor Who*, as Liz 10, in the episodes ""[The Beast Below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_Below)"" and ""[The Pandorica Opens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pandorica_Opens)"". [Derek Jacobi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Jacobi) reprised his role as the Master in 2007's ""[Utopia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(Doctor_Who\))"", this time canonically. [David Tennant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tennant) appeared in a cameo role as the Caretaker, later being cast as the [Tenth Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Doctor) in 2005.

&gt;Previous *Doctor Who* webcasts had limited animation and were little more than a series of illustrations. Earlier in 2003, BBCi had had some success with the original animated webcast *[Ghosts of Albion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_of_Albion)*. The animation for that story was provided by Manchester-based animation studio [Cosgrove Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosgrove_Hall_Films), who were also hired to animate *Scream of the Shalka*.

&gt;This story was the first officially licensed, fully animated *Doctor Who* story.

Religion has been used as fuel in the political fire, and as such the importance of religion has been bolstered and reinforced by political leaders, presented as the cause of the conflict and motivation to keep it going when it was really as much about power as anything else. In short, I doubt Ireland would be as religious as it is without the history of conflict with Britain and internally. It is Ireland's history that makes religion such a big thing over there.

Did I miss another professor who showed their research on the issue? 
Now I know I'm getting on a bit but I remember no mention of race or racist abuse at all, or how sexual abuse is somehow more damaging than other form of abuse. What does that even mean? Who quantifies the damage exactly? 
I'm perfectly fine with what the professor demonstrated with his 'sexist jokes normalise sexist behaviour' argument. My argument is that that is probably true of all abuse online or in the comedy club. Racist jokes will, I'm sure, paint the same picture on his chalk table of yellow &amp; blue racists, for example. It will normalise racist abuse in all stratas of society.

Well, one of the BE guys had seen my message on the support forum, logged into my router remotely, changed a bunch of settings and restarted it, and bumped my 2mbit/s up to about 5.5mbit/s, which was the maximum achievable on that line.

And Mourinho's tactics shackle Hazard? Hazard is perfect for the counter attack and I would wager that his speed and long shot ability is much more important than his dribbling or passing skill. If he was more of the dribbling type then the speed type I would agree with you but at the moment Mourinho is perfect using him as a counter attacking player. I strongly believe Hazard would look lost if he was in a team like City or Liverpool who thrive off possession.

This is just false. Its so absurd that I feel like writing a proper response to this would take up too much time that this statement definitely doesn't deserve. You either clearly underestimate our team, want to give an excuse to Mourinho or you over estimate the other teams.

&gt; This has to have been the weakest squad we have had in years.

Now you are just spouting utter nonsense. Did you see the team last season?? It was literally a much worse version of this squad, the only player who we had last season and not this season (of significant quality) is  Mata, who Mourinho wanted to sell.

&gt; And Mourinho's tactics shackle Hazard? Hazard is perfect for the counter attack and I would wager that his speed and long shot ability is much more important than his dribbling or passing skill.
 My mind is getting lost reading some of this stuff, fuck. Hazard's passing and dribbling is what makes him who he is, how on earth do you think that his dribbling isn't anywhere as important as his running??

 &gt; I strongly believe Hazard would look lost if he was in a team like City or Liverpool who thrive off possession.

Again, no. His skills are much more effective the more he has of the ball. When is the last time you have seen Hazard score off a counter attack? His dribbling and passing ability is nearly wasted in comparison with how much more useful and effective it would be in a team who play passing football.

&gt; You must be a piece of **** plastic if you can't appreciate Mourinho's efforts this season. I don't think a single manager on earth could have guided us to this finish, he made do with an extremely weak squad who had no right to be in the top 4.

Oh fuck off mate, I have been a supporter since Mourinho's first time round. He did brilliantly with his team because he used it to his strengths, Mourinho's 04/05 squad was like a Range Rover, and he knew exactly how to drive it. The current squad is like an Alfa Romeo, but he is trying to drive it just like the range rover. Different squads need different styles.

But one thing is for certain, this squad IS MORE than capable of having finishing in the top 4. Our goal for this season was undoubtedly the title and we fell short of it.

I mean, you could compare any half-decent striker or winger to what we paid for Carroll and Downing respectively and they'd always look like an absolute bargain.

In 2009, Lieutenant James Adamson, aged 24, of the Royal Regiment of Scotland was awarded the Military Cross for a bayonet charge whilst on a tour of duty in Afghanistan: after shooting one Taliban fighter dead Adamson had run out of ammunition when another enemy appeared. He immediately charged the second Taliban fighter and bayoneted him. In September 2012, Lance Corporal Sean Jones of The Princess of Wales's Regiment was awarded the Military Cross for his role in a bayonet charge which took place in October 2011.

The second goal was from a corner. We had 7 players in the opposition box. Honestly, the fact that we conceded from our own corner is embarrassing, and the entire team is at fault. In particular, Coutinho should have brought the breaking player down immediately, and Johnson should not have jumped in, allowing the counter to continue. That goal was due to bad positioning by everyone on the corner, and a tired challenge.

The third goal was the defence's fault entirely. An **over the top ball** straight through the middle... The defensive line was too deep, Skrtel was marking **two** men, Johnson didn't come across, Sakho was ball watching. It was disgraceful. 

So there was only one goal on the break - the second goal. Which not only the midfield is responsible for.

true,[deleted],null,null,"It's all well and good to make everything that can be equal, equal, but you need to consider that we might end up in a real war again (and not just a jaunt in Afghanistan). We would be at a disadvantage if a significant percentage of our front line armed forces were women. It's just another variable in warfare, and if the enemy don't have to contend with that then we are at a disadvantage. 

Why can't we just be honest and say that men do this better? Are we really in such an age where it's non-PC to point out this basic biological fact? If you can challenge the fundamental strength and endurance aspect, please do. But it seems every thing we learn about human biology simply proves men and women are really quite different creatures. 

With a group of say 1000 men I would say you can probably get a lot more done in the field than a group of 1000 women. They can travel further, faster, and with more gear. They can fight harder, longer, and get less injured. I mean most women in the field don't even have the strength to drag a fully grown male in gear off the field for medical attention. 

If a woman can indeed do an equal and identical job to a man then there's no issues. Then i'm all for it. But we as a society have already shown we will compromise on this basic meritocratic pillar of these strength based roles. I think what will happen is we will drastically reduce the bar. Which is fine for fire fighters, where women can have their weaknesses in the field balanced out. But in actual fighting? Not so much.

&gt;The army's new policy of making all recruits undergo the same physical training has resulted in many more injuries among female soldiers, research suggests.

&gt;A study claims that female recruits are more than twice as likely to suffer injury than when they were not expected to complete such a vigorous training programme as men.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11967351

&gt;We found that for all disease and injury categories of medical discharge there is a statistically significant excess in females; this disparity is particularly marked for discharges on account of injury [relative risk (RR) = 1.65, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 1.30-2.10] and musculoskeletal disease (RR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.75-4.06). Royal Navy females are eight times more likely (RR = 7.92, 95% CI = 3.03-20.66) and Army females seven times more likely (RR = 6.53, 95% CI = 2.60-16.42) than Royal Air Force females to be medically discharged on account of injury. Over the period 1993-1996, there was a statistically significant increase in the rate of medical discharge for both musculoskeletal disease and injury in female personnel in the British armed forces. During the period 1996-2000, a marked gender differential was maintained, but the rate of increase in females reached a plateau.

The saying is a lyric from Neil Young's ""[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cawk2cMTnGo)"". Kurt Cobain quoted it in his suicide note. John Lennon criticised the lyric though, saying those that faded away were survivors of the lifestyle, and they should be respected more than those that lived recklessly.

&gt; I hate it. It's better to fade away like an old soldier than to burn out. If he was talking about burning out like Sid Vicious, forget it. I don't appreciate the worship of dead Sid Vicious or of dead James Dean or dead John Wayne. It's the same thing. Making Sid Vicious a hero, Jim Morrison – it's garbage to me. I worship the people who survive – Gloria Swanson, Greta Garbo. They're saying John Wayne conquered cancer – he whipped it like a man. You know, I'm sorry that he died and all that – I'm sorry for his family – but he didn't whip cancer. It whipped him. I don't want Sean worshiping John Wayne or Johnny Rotten or Sid Vicious. What do they teach you? Nothing. Death. Sid Vicious died for what? So that we might rock? I mean, it's garbage you know. If Neil Young admires that sentiment so much, why doesn't he do it? Because he sure as hell faded away and came back many times, like all of us. No, thank you. I'll take the living and the healthy.

true,winchyy,lfc68,,"This is meant to allow teams to bring youngsters through in a system that is internal for the club, instead of relying on loans to develop young players.


Players that are loaned out aren't necessarily starters for their loan sides, which is the entire point of loaning out a youngster. They are also subject to playing a style of football which is conducive to the style which is played by their parent club.  This means that their only week in week out competitive football could be of a completely different style of football than their parent club, which makes returning to their parent club and succeeding all the more harder.


The idea of a B competition should in fact allow for more young players to be brought through clubs with large academy's. It also means that these players can experience week in week out competitive football without having to go on loan. This enables clubs to have a larger impact on the players development and training, while also enabling them to deal with any potential injuries. This will also increase the competition for places in the ""B"" team, while providing a solid game for any 1st Team Reserves to participate in to either attain match fitness, or find some form.


It's also important to remember that this is being made to help clubs in England support and nurture future English talent. This will enable more  talented and able youngsters to progress in their  development, with the aim being to create a stronger English football structure and pool of talent, ultimately leading to more National success.

TL;DR B team means less loans, more in house games for young players. Allows improved T&amp;D as well as sticking with a particular style of football.

They are more likely to appologize then get mad. Sakho is new, but Skrtel should make his expectations known. Carra doesn't let in a goal muchless 3 without getting his defenders concentrated and in correct position.

All our defenders are too new or too friendly, we brought in Kolo due to his reputation, but he also lacks confince so you only ever see him encouraging the others. Next defender must have quality and reputation to not accept letting in multiple goals due to shity defending from his defense. I noticed last season or before that Carra made a mistake yet shouted at his fullback, much like Suarez does when someone misses after failing to pass, the point is that he doesn't sulk after his fuckup, he gives some of the blame to the othef defender who let a player get past him.

As a nurse I work as an advocate for my patients, I've spoken up before about people not having access to internet, for example, a patient of mine wanted to send an email to her daughter, to wish her happy birthday (The daughter lives in another country). An easy enough thing to accomplish you'd think. We got the computer on wheels down, I signed in to my NHS account and  supervised, and we found out that all external email suppliers are banned on the NHS internet. I had to let her send the email from my NHS Mail. Luckily she knew the email of the top of her head. I've since sent an email to the tech people asking if there can be a guest account with limited access to external email suppliers, (Perhaps with downloads blocked to ensure that the computer stays virus free). 
Speaking up, even as a student member of the NHS can make a difference. The hospital I was working in, had wireless access for the computer on wheels, so it's only a matter of time until the Patients can access this, hopefully!

Very true -  the entire idea of taking someone into care is to remove them from potentially harmful environments and being careful about what people can access online is important - as vulnerable people you need to make sure they don't spend time in harmful places. However I think a lot of the senior people consider ""the internet"" to be one solid thing, and not an extension of peoples lives like it actually is, to be handled carefully like you would with each facet of their actual lives. It's different to just keeping an alcoholic away from the pub, or a gambler away from the casino.

Working in the NHS you clearly know better yourself though and as you say, as younger, more switched on people work their way up and speak out things will change, it's just unfortunate that the system is such a huge lumbering beast that it's a step behind most of the time :)

The idea is that by charging Mourinho, the FA are saying they understand that Mike Dean did a shit job and because of that they understand that Mourinho is being sarcastic. Also, because they are charging Mourinho, it shows that what Mourinho said is true, because if he made a false claim they couldn't charge him. Neither of those are true though.

First, I can know someone is saying something sarcastically without actually agreeing with it. Imagine a chess game where I made an odd move, and my opponent took my piece and said, ""Nice move, Einstein"", but that was all part of a larger plan that I had expected. I know he's being sarcastic, and I understand that he thinks my move was dumb, but that doesn't mean I agree with his conclusion.

Second, Ashley Cole was charged for the calling the FA ""A bunch of twats"". By the logic of some people, that would mean that the FA are admitting that they are a literal group of vaginas. They aren't admitting that. We all know they are a figurative bunch of vaginas, but charging someone over the comment isn't admitting that they are correct.

Most of these leftist types are from affluent, middle class families, and who are caught up in the craze of trying to be as progressive as possible, even to the point of absurdity.

Anyone with even half a brain could tell you that if you accept hundreds of thousands of people from countries that are 200 years behind Britain in terms of women's rights, gay rights, laws against pedophilia and child marriage, etc.. then you are going to see those things occurring more and more within our culture.

Yet because they live in their affluent middle class neighborhoods, their fantasy can continue because they don't have to actually deal with the damage of the policies they support.

&gt;Mass immigration from extremely primitive areas of tribal Pakistan and Bangladesh, where child marriage, oppression of women, and murder of homosexuals is commonplace? Who cares! I don't live in the areas of high immigration anyway. And if I do hear anyone coming out against this, I'll accuse them of being a racist! 

Or their other favourite accusation, paranoia. ""You're paranoid!"" or ""You're xenophobic!""

Never mind the fact that we have seen Lutfur Rahman, an extremist Islamist with links to Islamist organisations voted into an office of British governance in Tower Hamlets, by the huge muslim voting block there. Anyone who has lived in Tower Hamlets knows that it is an extremely hostile place towards women and homosexuals. If you're a woman, try walking through Tower Hamlets in a skirt. Listen to how many times you'll be called a pig, a slut, or a whore. You try walking through Tower Hamlets, if you're a gay man, holding your boyfriend's hand. In fact I don't encourage that, I genuinely would worry for the safety of anyone with the courage to try it. 

It won't be long before we see muslim parties running in the elections. And you know what? We won't be able to do anything about it. In 30/40 years time when this problem is 20x worse than it is now, there will be one group to blame. The left wing middle class dreamers who had their heads in the clouds.

I'd have to take an opposing view on that. Just as with cinema, music videos or games can definitely carry an ideological underpinning. Just off the top of my head the anti-war quotes included in some (all?) *Call of Duty* games are obviously meant to have a political punch and convey a specific ideology.

[This](http://nideffer.net/classes/270-10/week_04_critique/gamesandideologicalframespdf.pdf) analysis is pretty interesting. 

Also, with that said, it can be argued that games as a distraction (See: Adorno &amp; Horkheimer and Stuart Hall's work on popular culture) are ideological in the sense that they support the status quo. Though I'm  not exactly 100% behind this being applied to games.

&gt;You could've replacement the word 'woman' with 'black' or 'poor' or 'old' &amp; it still would've rung true. 

I think this highlights another problem, racist jokes seem more likely to be called out (See: Jim Davidson, Bernard Manning and even some Frankie Boyle stuff and the  shifts seen in comedy).

true,teamyoshi,null,null,"&gt; I really want to see the countryside and the sea and small towns and above all, meet people. Where should I go?

If I were you I would look into Cornwall (and the South-West), the Cotswolds, The Peak District, The Lake District and East Anglia in England, The Western Isles and Highlands in Scotland, and Snowdonia and the Coast in Wales. I can't help you much with Ireland, as I have only been to Dublin, I am sure it is lovely but I have no particularly useful tips for you I'm afraid.

&gt;Also, is there a big camping culture in the UK?

Camping is definitely a thing over here, but I wouldn't say it is a big thing. It is certainly not a staple of our lifestyle, more of a subculture. If you are in your 20's you might not meet too many people your age, as it tends towards the older crowd.

&gt;I would love to do some back country camping if that is a thing.

If you want to camp outside of organised sites (legally) you are probably going to have to hit up Scotland, as I am pretty sure it is illegal in the rest of the UK (hit up google for precise details), but there should be enough organised campsites for you to get by in most of the places I mentioned above. If you are really hot on the idea of back-country camping then you might want to think about sticking to Scotland and maybe hitting up Norway and/or Sweden as well, as free camping is more of a thing over there.

If you can spare the time/cash, I would also think about hitting up Northern France, Belgium and Holland, all of which are easily accessible form Southern England. If I were you I would try to at least check out Amsterdam and/or Paris. I would check prices for flights to and from Paris as well as London, as you could potentially fly into one and out from the other without spending any extra cash.

As far as transport goes, trains are a decent option city-to city, but if you are going to be hitting up the more remote parts of the country you might end up relying on buses too, which I wouldn't recommend, so car hire might well be your best option. Presumably you will be flying into and out of London. Trust me when I tell you that you will not want a car while you are in London, so you can rely on public transport while you are there and hire a car when you want to get out. If you are planning to take a hire car out of the UK, you will have to make sure that the hire-car company are OK with foreign travel. Also bear in mind that we tax the hell out of Petrol over here, so your petrol cost is likely to average at north of $8 per (US) gallon, so hire the most economical car that you can.

true,Blaidd_Dwrg,eng-lancashire,Preston,"Sorry for lateness, I fell asleep. Here's some stuff I found useful:

---

* Youtube videos!

Just like when you're trying to fix your car, it's always helpful to watch someone else doing it. If you search you'll find loads of videos and it can be helpful to see how different people do things differently. I watched loads of videos before I finally worked up the gumption to brew my first batch. [This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRltUZZPh-U&amp;list=PLKXO1KMtqnh7udS6iF_SADQIOWRmLOBjN) has a fun channel. Check out his video on ""applejack"", you might want to try making that at some point.

---

* http://www.howtobrew.com/

John Palmer's book is effectively the bible when it comes to homebrew. It's all about beer so there's a lot of stuff in there that's not relevant to making cider, but there is some useful info in there, plus you might later on find yourself getting interested in making beer. That's where I am now; this slope is very slippery.

---

* /r/homebrewing and /r/cider.

As /u/rustman said there are some excellent resources in the sidebar and the locals are generally helpful.

---

* ebay!

The place is a goldmine for homebrew equipment. [Here is the first fermenter I bought](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/181247522972?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2649). Note the tap at the bottom: I definitely recommend spending the extra couple of quid for this, it's a lot easier than messing about with a siphon.

---

* Alcotec turbo yeast

If you ever have the opportunity to buy a packet of this stuff, DON'T. It's designed to produce a very high ABV in a short space of time, which sounds like a good idea but the end result tastes bloody awful. Wine, cider and ale yeasts will all produce good results.

---

* Buy two buckets

One for fermentation, one for bottling. You can bottle straight from primary but if you're making last minute additions like I do in the recipe in my other post it makes sense to do this in a secondary. Plus you'll reduce the amount of yeast that ends up in your bottles this way.

---

* Start simple

My first batch was just apple juice and sugar. The recipe has grown from there as with each new batch I've thought ""hm, this is nice, but it would be better if..."" Starting simple also allows you to get a handle on the basic techniques.

---

Absolutely means ""not at all"". Yet we _can_ openly criticise our politicians, their policies on economics or anything else.

You can criticise me. I can criticise you. And neither of us will be arrested. Newspapers and broadcasters can criticise and condemn if they feel the need without journalists getting locked up in prison.

So we do have some free speech. Just not unlimited free speech.

You seem only to see things at one extreme or the other, that either we have absolute free speech or none at all. It's actually a little bit more complicated than that.

If you're still not convinced that we have free speech, I recommend that you carefully examine how things are in Belarus or China or North Korea, and compare with the UK.

On the subject of noticing the problem:  They say they sent a letter, and may very well have.   If I get something through the box that says SKY on it it'll go in the bin under the assumption it's an advert.

This was really the only time DD has come back to bite me, until now I was very happy letting my bills automatically take care of themselves. 

When I found the problem I was quickly reminded why I don't have regular contact with Sky:  It is soooo time consuming to try and deal with them over the phone.   If I had caught this on time my path of least resistance would still have been to close the account......nevermind the problem that there are not that many companies in that market space.

Stocks and shares isas often pay 5% on the dividend and can do compounded dividend. For example, if you invested 5k into unilever (for example) you'd make £200 a year which can be automatically reinvested in unilever providing you with more dividend the following year (for investment or to keep); obviously this comes with some risk though and having ""all your eggs in one basked"" is a bad idea, however on the flip side the shares may also be worth more and could make A LOT of money...

UKIP appeals to several groups which owes to their popularity. It seems to attract people from all over on a common idea of exiting the EU. Most people don't understand what UKIP are actually about, as UKIP haven't really stated what they are about besides a single issue. As soon as they establish policies, a larger portion of their support will crumble and any idea they will be significant in government will be gone.

With /r/UKpolitics, I have seen it take a massive massive swing to the right. There is a stupid amount of downvotes and its no longer a good place to have a discussion most of the time.

FIFY, the points I'm making are highly relevant. You claim we don't need nuclear but instead can rely on a distributed power generation network of wind and solar. I'm telling you thats not feasible and that we still need a central grid and it needs a reliable and efficient power source connected to it.

&gt; Future technology will mean it becomes more feasible.

Irrelevant, we need solutions now! We can't waste time hoping for something to be invented. In that case we might as well wait till Fusion comes online. Nuclear is a viable option now, we should use it.

&gt;  Nuclear is more expensive than wind and solar (we mostly agree)

That its more expensive, not that that means we shouldn't use it.

&gt;GM is controversial (as our talk has shown it is controversial for many different reasons)

So was climate change for a long time, just because something is controversial with idiots doesn't mean that there is any basis for their controversy or that we should listen to them.

&gt;I never argued to ban GM for example as you suggested

No but the Greens did, and you want me to support the greens, therefore relevant.

&gt;I never argued that the grid could be run on batteries, never argued that heavy industry could be run off grid

You haven't said it but you've wilfully ignored how they would be run without Nuclear, you just keep talking about distributed energy networks with lots of small firms, great for domestic power needs, shitty for the rest.

&gt;It takes 20 years for a new Nuclear plant to start running, I think in 20 years we will have great advancements in the renewable energy and energy storage

But after those 20 years we will have a power station which is running and keeping the lights on with Nuclear, absolutely guaranteed. With wind and solar we may have something thats better ready for commercial use but it will still need building, large windfarms can take 10-15 years to plan and build as well or we might not even have anything, and then we're screwed.

Interestingly you haven't brought up Germany at any stage, a country thats pledged to completely shut down Nuclear and offered big subsidies to renewables, maybe because as a result they are now completely dependent on Russian gas for their power and as the Economist recently described,

&gt;In energy, Germany is trying to switch from nuclear and fossil-fuel sources to sun, wind and biomass. But it is not going well. Electricity prices are going up; German companies are losing ground to foreign rivals; and carbon emissions are rising, not falling.

I'm going to give up to be honest, its pretty clear that you aren't going to change your might on this. Your 1 sided 'summary' of this debate is hilariously skewed and you've ignored several absolutely fundamental points by claiming they are irreverent or obscuring the issue.

true,samw11,null,null,"Sounds like a great holiday! How long will you be here? Also, how do you feel about walking?

There are lots of great walks in the UK. Hadrians Wall is a great place to do a walking/camping holiday. It's really pretty, it's in the country (for the most part), &amp; you can easily find lots of great campsites across the whole of the UK at ukcampsite.co.uk, you can even specify what facilities you are looking for. 

I'd also recommend The North Wales coast &amp; the Nefyn peninsula, and the Southern Upland way in Southern Scotland. The Highlands are beautiful, if you don't mind not camping for a few nights, check out Heather Cottage or the Factor's Cottage at Inverlochy Castle near Fort William. There is some gorgeous countryside, is not far from Ben Nevis &amp; Aenoch Mor (spelling on that may be a bit wobbly) but although it's a bit touristy, is pretty quiet if you decide to walk up! 

People have already recommended the Lake District &amp; Cornwall,both of which are really popular holiday destinations, but also have tonnes of tourists. Check out the New Forest though &amp; also both the Isle of Mann and the North East. Alnwick, Lindisfarne &amp; Berwick have some tourist facilities but aren't too spoiled.

Last tip (promise), if you can be flexible on dates, basically avoid August. August is main school holiday season &amp; everyone puts prices up due to increased demand, if you still want to experience tyre awesomeness of British Summer Time (bring an umbrella, a raincoat &amp; wellies anyway) then check out early-mid July or mid-late September. Before &amp; after the school holidays is. Somewhat cheaper &amp; knocks a lot of the local tourists out of the running as people with school age children face expensive fines for taking their children out of school in term time. 

Wherever you end up, take lots of pictures &amp; enjoy yourself! ",0,1399620520,null,0,false,0,chdh640,t3_253g6p,t1_chdh640,t3_253g6p,null,1433718703,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Most of the cameras used ISDN2 lines (128kbs) to transfer footage back to the control room, unless they happened to be close enough to use line-of-sight radio or fibre.  They could manage something like 1 or 2 frames a second of sub-vga quality footage.  Also unless it's a new camera, chances are they're 1990's-vintage, using some propitiatory-just-good-enough codec that's now well out of date but it would cost a small fortune to upgrade the control room equipment to something with better quality and frame rates.

This does NOT usually translate to better care or service for complex things that are difficult to quantify, such as education or healthcare. Or even things where it does, but there is substantial monopoly that whoever owns things doesn't have to care due to lack of consumer freedom.

And this is ignoring the fact that most people who've dealt with enterprise realise that large companies are often HORRENDOUSLY inefficient, due to managing lots of things being actually quite difficult, dilution of responsibility, communication issues, etc.

Sure, there are many things I would trust private companies with over the government with - simple tasks such as building a website.

Another thing that compounds the issue is cronyism aka corruption. When they privatise, that doesn't mean you or I have any realistic chance of starting a company that can take over that bit of state function and do it efficiently and well with low overheads. No, it means that the people who the politicians are in bed with get to grab industries at little cost and often just burn them for profit, because they are insiders, and we are not.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"Camping? We invented it. ;-)

Seriously, though, if you want to camp you will have a large choice of camping and caravanning sites, most of which accept tent campers as well as caravans and motor-homes (and even the odd imported RV from the USA!)

The main club in the UK (Like the Kampgrounds of America over there) is [The Camping and Caravanning Club (or CCC)](http://www.campingandcaravanningclub.co.uk/) - have a look here for sites and you might want to consider membership.

Back country camping may be a little more difficult - we do have nationally protected spaces here (the Forest of Dean springs to my mind), and these sites may allow camping within some guidelines, but outside of these areas camping might not be wise - a lot of the land is in use for farming, and farmers don't take too kindly to campers most of the time if they are there without permission.

As for places to go, I'm going to suggest a slightly different area from most of the people below and suggest a trip out to the Herefordshire area (I'm a native of the area) - walking in the Malvern Hills gives spectacular views on a decent day, the walk can be as easy or as challenging as you like (up to a point of course!) and you can make the walk as long or as short as you like as well.

Other options in the area include the Brecon Beacons, just over the border in Wales, which are similar to the Malverns but are more well known. There are also a large number of castles in the area from the times when the English used to have to pacify the Welsh a lot.

There are also a number of other attractions in the area - depending on how interested in history you are. There is Eastnor castle in Malvern, which is a 19th century mock castle that is the local stately home, plus there is the old market house in Ledbury nearby you could visit, as well as a number of other timber framed buildings in the town, plus some 16th century frescoes in one of the buildings. There is also an old hospital site, St Katherine's Hospital, which was founded  c.1231.  

You could also consider visiting Hereford Cathedral, which apart from being a magnificent building houses a Mappa Mundi, this one being c.1300. You might also consider a trip to the Bulmers factory in Hereford - they are a cider producing company, and whilst it's a touristy thing to do, it's not normally that busy and it is out in the countryside!

In more general terms, a trip to Brighton might be good - there is a lively community there where you should easily be able to talk to people and it's by the sea as well - it is rather touristy though, so depending on how much you are trying to avoid tourists you might want other options.

If you want really rural England, have a look at going to Devon or Cornwall (although Cornwall has recently been recognised as a minority so I don't know if I can describe it as part of England any more ;-)) - there may not be much to do or see here but you could get some nice trips to the seaside in and the locals are normally very friendly.

They lie when they say they don't hate poor people anymore. It is what you suspect they'll do, which parts they are lying on, that matters.

In particular the LD u-turn on student fees was most damaging because they lied about a position that the LDs had built their legitimacy on.

Wild camping is permitted in all wild/countryside areas of Scotland (obvious exceptions apply, e.g. missile ranges, gardens, fields under active cultivation), and the more general right to responsibly access land is enshrined in law and tradition. You do not need a landowner's permission to be on his/her land, but it's sometimes a good idea to inform the local estate (large area of privately held land) that you are there, as shooting and deer stalking may be going on - the stag season is June to October.

In terms of wildness, some nice places to camp would be Assynt, Fisherfield Forest (not a forest), Harris, or the central Cairngorms.

UKIPs old policies, and as they have not published others we can not base our opinions on anything else, are flawed and uncosted. 
I am pro Europe, from both a trade and a political stability stand point. 
I agree that the unchecked immigration into this country has bought about issues but every party agrees this. But ukip want to freeze immigration for 5 years.
It appals me that 20% of the voters support such an ill thought out political movement.  But I always said that if the BNP had a publicly acceptable leader they could win seats. Ukip have this leader.  
But the good thing is that 80% of people don't want them. 
And rather than becoming a force in British politics they will be a mid term protest vote and go back to single figures.  It's a good job we don't have PR but because we don't we will never have a UKIP MP and I'm bloody happy about that.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; Crazy idea alert: Rather than spending millions of pounds trying to scaremonger the public in to not downloading copyrighted material illegally, how about instead ensuring that copyrighted material is available to purchase quickly, easily, and at a cost that makes it a no brainer. For example, guess how many music albums I've downloaded illegally since signing up for a Spotify subscription?

Not that I'm particularly disagreeing that it should be easy, but on my phone I can go from listening to a song on the radio, shazaming it and downloading it in seconds.  Or I can find virtually every song and music video on youtube within seconds of Googling.  In fact, in many cases it is easier to do this than try and find it through a torrent.  But that won't stop the people who are torrenting because they don't want to pay the 99p or whatever it is (or watch an ad for 30 seconds) to have access to the music.

The problem arises more for videos, tv shows (which have a higher cost) and sport.  If I want to watch St Johnstone v Dundee Utd on Sunday week it is such a pain in the backside to find it anywhere on tv (even though it is on BBC Scotland) that it is easier to find an illegal stream.  I wanted to watch a one off game of premier league football on BT sport earlier in the season and I literally tried to do it through all possible means until eventually I gave up and just watched on an illegal stream.  Make it easy and we'll do it.

buying five or ten games per week (or per paycheck) etc, thats money/resources you could be investing or doing other things with.

you could start your own business with disposable income.

Whilst you are quite correct in the etymology of the word, I'm afraid that like all things the language has changed with the times.  Or should we remove the Latin, German, and indeed French (as well as all the others) from our own language just to make sure we are communicating in the correct and true manner?

No, because that would be stupid.  As equally silly in fact as the segment of the French population that seek to stop the bastardisation of their language (which hit the headlines with ""Le BigMac"" in I believe the 80's or 90's).

Some (but not all: audible left turns are no use if you are already half-way up the inside of a bus) of your suggestions achieve the same end but for much higher cost.  Anything requiring modifications to vehicles will take a very long time to implement (I'm not sure to what extent you can change the regulations for vehicles retrospectively: I have a car which has no turn signals and is legal, for instance...).  My guess is that it will save lives and that it does so for a very low cost.

Against that, as you say, it's kind of patronising, and it makes it seems like cyclists are to blame in cases when they are not.

I think it's worth it, in this case: saving lives seems like a good idea, and there clearly are many cyclists who do unfortunately behave very stupidly. There are, of course, at *least* as high a proportion of car/bus/lorry drivers who behave stupidly as well, but their idiocy tends not to kill them so often.

It works because it gives something back, offline mode, social connectivity, match making, voice comms, etc.  

DRM can be fine and well accepted if it is correctly implemented, gives incentives to have it around (Steam sales, etc.) and will more often than not fail in a way that makes the customer happy (offline mode).

&gt;[Sharia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia) (other variations Shariah, Shari’ah, Shar’ah)  is the Muslim or Islamic law which regulates many aspects of a Muslim’s life including the type of investments allowed. For instance, interests are considered usury according to the [Riba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riba) rule therefore bonds are prohibited to investors following the Sharia law. A Shariah compliant fund is an investment vehicle fund structured in accordance to Shariah rules. Shariah funds can be managed as [mutual funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_funds), [ETFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund)  or [hedge funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_funds). They are in essence common funds with an extra layer of ethical rules integrated in the investment polices of the fund  not dissimilar to [SRIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socially_Responsible_Investment). While the funds are required to be fully compliant with Shariah rule, the companies structuring, managing and promoting the funds do not have to be necessarily Shariah compliant.

This is exactly it. If you want people to buy your stuff, make it attractive to them. So far every anti piracy measure has punished paying customers while having little/no impact on pirates. 

If I buy a DVD I have to sit through a shit load of unskipable antipiracy warnings (""we know you pirated this, don't deny it, we're coming to get you!) or trailers when I just want to watch the damn movie. Pirates skip past all of that. DRM on games forces players to be always online and verify their legal purchases (I even get locked out of some of my mobile games every week because I don't have a connection and it can't check my license). 

Plus, in the UK at least, there doesn't seem to be any place to legally buy (not stream) digital movies/tv shows apart from iTunes which then limits the devices you can use to watch it.

If you want to start a debate, you need to give people points to agree/disagree with. And not resort to personal attacks.

They're a young party, and while they are certainly making many mistakes - from the way they are putting the policies across to some of the individuals they've had involved - getting a political party off the ground and moving forward on a coherent platform is *tough*. I don't think they're ready for this election myself, but longer term I do think they've got something to offer to those moderate unionists put off by DUP style fundamentalist politics, and pro union catholics who really wouldn't feel welcome in, or comfortable supporting, the DUP/UUP.

But in a tiny, highly professional infantry the only outcomes of mixing women in to the infantry will be that the effectiveness is either maintained or it decreases. It's certainly not going to increase. So why risk lives over a social-experiment in feminism?

There is a strong argument against mixing infantry units! But if women can meet the physical requirements then let them form female units. What's wrong with that?

Even if it is ""encouragement"" of the moral type it is still a bad idea.

The reality is that the army is not just a tool for conducting warfare, it has effects that go beyond that and into our society.

A lot of experience has been gained in this area by Israel, which has been experimenting with using women on the front line since about 1948.

One major factor which I really don't see a solution to is the behavior of the *other* side. The IDF has tended to engage radical Islamists a fair bit, and these people tend not to have the highest opinion of women and equality. Apparently the IDF found that when these people discovered they were fighting women, they tended to be more fanatical and *less likely to surrender*. This presumably leads to greater casualties on both sides, which by all accounts isn't a great outcome.

There are also possibly psychological/morale issues relating to how male troops react if their female comrades get injured/killed, but I don't really know enough about this to form a strong opinion. In general, I think women ought to be encouraged to take up these roles, but only if they can do so without reducing operational effectiveness of the units they are in.

Main reason it seems odd is that Small Paul had an up and down season and we are going to ask for a substantial sum of money for him, probably more than his performance would warrant.  

Would have figured Chelsea would have looked at alternatives at either a higher or lower sum of money just so they wouldn't have to haggle with Levy who is a complete pain in the ass on the very best of terms, let alone a situation where there seems to be animosity.

Makes me wonder if there are legs to the Lukaku rumors, we actually sell to Chelsea (albeit at a high price) and in return Chelsea do the same with Lukaku to us.

true,AJH1779,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"Social norms are social constructs. They are all in the mind and reinforced by what you learn from the people you associate with. In this country and many others, there is the reinforcement, passive and active, that gender roles exist.

This leads to the perception that women are more intrinsically valuable than men (""protect your women and children""), that it is more important for men to be successful (you should earn more than you wife/care for your wife), and that women are meant to be the carers of children (""mothers place is in the home"").

These are not things like the difference in physical strength between average man and average woman. These can be altered by education and changing of the social realm, which has to be done slowly and incrementally, and has been ongoing for years. That is why the objections that mostly get raised, relating to how men and women perceive each other and behave around each other, can be removed by education and training. The time it will take is not yet known, we haven't tried it before and have few countries to base information on, but it can happen and will eventually happen.

The reason I say these views are not rational, is precisely because they are based on social constructs which are not in themselves rational. There are many things people do and believe which have no foundation in reality, but rather come from evolved beliefs and rituals from thousands of years of society. If there are rational basis for objections, they can be made independent of the social context.

That does not make the social context any less valid when figuring out how to go about implementing things, but the social context does not make anything impossible, merely difficult, and take time to get going.",0,1399634856,null,0,false,0,chdjm49,t3_252rg6,t1_chdjm49,t1_chdjgxr,null,1433719855,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,hungoverseal,null,null,"I think that whilst the Army does have secondary roles yes it's primary role is being a perfect tool of war. Those secondary roles are a big reason for the need of women in the military, peacekeeping and training of native forces in places like Afghan and Iraq have shown that clearly. The second however we start interfering with the primary role of the army we are starting to risk everything and society in it's entirety. That includes the advancements in womens rights.

Yes you are right, reduced effectiveness mainly comes from how the unit works together. No homosexuals are not an issue as the statistical likelihood of having two in the same unit is very low and there's not going to be any rumours of a gay guy gaining favour by fucking his way to the top. Now the whole alpha male protectionism thing is something I think you're correct on, that can actually be challenged by improvement in our understanding of or changes to gender roles. What won't change though no matter how much you shout about gender roles is Biology. Men will always want to fuck women and women will always want to fuck men. Because of that there are a lot of issues.

Men won't trust the guy next to him if he thinks that person is in some form of relationship with another person in the unit. I certainly wouldn't. Men won't trust the women next to them if they think she's in a relationship with another guy in the unit. Men won't trust a woman in authority in the military because she may have been given a pussy pass (regardless of it's bullshit or not the rumour or thought is as dangerous). On top of this you then have problems with sexual harassment. Men can't tell the same jokes any more, can't tell the same stories anymore without fear of being pulled up for harassment. There's not going to be the same bonding. I don't see the field fuck scene from Jarhead happening with girls in the unit, not without the risk of the guys getting court martial-ed. The girls won't be sleeping in the same bunks as the guys, won't be marching with the guys and won't be washing with the guys. Like a marine said in another sub-reddit: ""Why the fuck should I risk my life for someone who don't even live, sleep and wash with me"". 

I think the whole it's good for society thing is rubbish as well. It's not saying women are inferior to men. It's saying men are more suited in general to a task and because of issues with male bonding the introduction of women reduces their effectiveness. In the situation of a small, professional army the benefits do not outweigh the risks.

It's also unlikely that ISA tax-exemption would be covered by an Anglo-American tax agreement, and similarly unlikely that the American IRS will give it the same treatment as their (loose) equivalent schemes, such as the Roth-IRA.

**Seek expert advice, but here's my 2 pence/cents:** If the Americans tax your ISA, then whether you should remove money from the ISA depends on whether your move is truly permanent, and whether there is a commensurate scheme available in the US. If it is not permanent, then you are better off keeping it in the ISA, as when you return to the UK, you can continue to receive the tax-free proceeds from your investment. The opportunity cost of withdrawing from the ISA is that it will take you two tax years just to put the £25,000 back into your account (due to the £15,000 allowance), meaning you are taxed on any interest you earn in the meantime.

Additionally, with few exceptions, your capital must be moved into an ISA in cash. That means that if you had withdrawn and reinvested, you would need to sell off any shares you'd bought before moving back into the ISA -- this introduces additional costs and delays which act against any return you'd be getting.

Male suffering is hilarious; loose women will joke and laugh at a man who was tortured and mutilated by his spouse  but national campaigns are launched when a song has sexual innuendo.

But you would find different approaches to problems in other sciences, and they generally manage to integrate the approaches to draw stronger conclusions. For instance, in geology, there are several distinct ways to 'date' a stratum (layer of rock). You can look at the evolutionary patterns and distribution of the fossils (biostratigraphy), you can examine magnetic minerals (magnetostratigraphy), or you can date the crystallisation ages of mineral systems (chronostratigraphy). These are approaches which come from different areas (biology, physics and chemistry), and can often provide results which are initially contradictory, but this then allows the geologist to analyse his assumptions and see which ones are incorrect. The distinction between theoretical and experimental physics is the same: the results of the latter help to identify the correct theories identified by the former.

If economics wants to stand among the other sciences which investigate the natural world, then surely it can start to develop a synthesis of the conflicting models of economic behaviour (neoclassical vs. Austrian schoo vs. whatever)?",0,1399635981,null,0,false,0,chdjuty,t3_25433h,t1_chdjuty,t1_chdila2,null,1433719969,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Recent polls show that, yes, there is a split on the view on nuclear; but that overall public support for nuclear is at a high in recent years, with more in support than opposed ([YouGov](http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/article3253-British-public-split-on-nuclear-power), [UK Energy Research Centre](http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/article3253-British-public-split-on-nuclear-power)). What's interesting is public opinion on nuclear is more or less the same, if not slightly higher, than it was before Fukushima.

Also, most of the cost of a nuclear power station is the upfront capital cost (including a substantial amount of capital going to cover the cost of the money needed). Once a reactor is up and running, the costs to keep it running safe (fuel, maintenance, etc) are relatively low. This includes costs for the eventual decommissioning of the power station - a company running a nuclear power station in the UK is required by law to set this money aside while the power station is running.",0,1399636010,null,0,false,0,chdjv20,t3_2546c2,t1_chdjv20,t1_chdj4ub,null,1433719973,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

A friend had several unpaid debts and was being chased by Bailiffs. He replied to them saying he didn't believe he owed the debt and asking them to prove that he did - after all, it's up to them to do so. They couldn't, because that involved the Bailiffs and the original creditor proving that he owed them money, and they couldn't find those records.

The fact you've got a letter from a court makes things tricky - it's not a private matter any more, they have taken you to court and the judge has ruled you do owe the amount asked for. But what's confusing me is that you should have been informed of the court date - after all, you have a right to go and defend yourself. I'd get in touch with them and see why you weren't informed.

At this point though if a small claims court has ruled that you have to pay the debt and you've let it go to the point a bailiff has been appointed, I'd tell them you want to pay the original court ordered amount - the £75 fee and £300 seems to be an arbitrary figure with no basis in reality. So go and talk to them, say you are prepared to pay the original court ordered amount (remember they will have bought the debt for less than this amount, so they're still making money) and that you don't believe this new £375 amount is fair so you don't recognise it.

Trouble is, actual economics is based on graphs (ie consumer spending, economic growth, GDP) and other data (number of companies started each year, employment figures, household wealth), with a *bit* of ideology implied (ie that free trade/free market is better).  

Marxism is based on feelings and morals.   The only data we have is rough data from the USSR and select other socialist countries from over 20 years ago (Cuba and NK don't make much information public believe it or not), and Marxists don't even accept those as 'actually socialist' (in classic No True Scotsman style).  In addition, trying to apply theories of 'bourgeoisie' and 'proletariat' to anything doesn't even make sense and is major shoehorning because there aren't two classes right now, rather a spectrum which Marx could never have predicted having written his book 166 FUCKING YEARS AGO.  

So I cannot support the vague addition of touchy feely ideology about 'wage slavery' and 'teh class struggle' into what should be a subject at least roughly based on both science and the actual economy as it is, not as it is in some fantasy land.

Good. There are exceptions allowed in treatment for some religions, perhaps there shouldn't be?

&gt; So you don't mind eating it when you have to, I smell hypocrisy.

No I don't mind eating it when I have to. Thats not hypocritical thats practical.Even if i was able to tell how an animal was slaughtered (I can't) it would only be hypocritical if i was a die hard campaigner, but I'm not - i've just expressed a preference. Likewise I prefer it if everyone had nice fuel efficient cars - that doesn't mean i won't set foot in a 4x4, but I am in favour of the strict rules being applied to the industry to improve it.  

&gt; So since they invented and brought coffee to this country, should we ban coffee in case we all secretly turn into muslims,is that how it works?

This comment is so dumb I can't engage with it. We are talking about where possible treating animals more humanely.

&gt; Would you suggest that Jews be forced to lose the skullcap, Sikhs the turban, christians the cross, rastafarians the colourful hats. Would this make you personally happier if everyone just acted like white British atheists and lost their identity altogether.?

Again you are jumping off the deep end into a pool of dumbness. I am talking about how animals (and other humans) are treated. Nobody can argue that a jewish skullcap infringes on the well being of others to a great extent. If you are going to debate this stuff with people it might be best if you actually stick to the issues they raise rather than inventing your own persecutions. 

&gt; As British born tax-paying citizens that contribute to this country do they get a voice too or are we expected to impose on them.

Nobody is disagreeing with that. Not sure why you think anyone's voices are not being heard. 

tl;dr - you are talking a lot of shit that is nothing to do with this subject. it is painfully dumb and you seem to have a giant complex that turns every comment about this into a direct attack on muslims. If it makes you feel better I can list out stupid shit that christians do that they shouldn't?

If you can build a massive number of wind turbines for a small portion of a nuclear plant in much less time, then it is politically more viable, and allows for cost to be spread out over a larger period of time.

The decommission costs are also a problem despite companies being required to set money aside. If the money is not there, it will cost the government money (such as if the company collapses or whatever). Unless they make the law bulletproof, it should be factored into the costs to the government.

Increasing the quality of the competition,  will raise the standard of football through the leagues

The FA Cup would get more exciting (from our perspective)

Cons: It will make it difficult for the other teams to compete on a financial basis.

Promotion will get a little bit harder.

I've posted a lot about this recently, so just visit the link for more information, or reply if you need help setting it up.

Unfortunately, in the long term savings are actually risky because although your interest rate is indeed compounding, so does inflation :(. Therefore you're betting that the interest rate will outstrip inflation over the 17years. For example CPI is a low estimate of inflation, but averaged over the past 17 years it has been [2.1%](http://www.rateinflation.com/consumer-price-index/uk-historical-cpi?start-year=1997&amp;end-year=2014) meaning your sons total is [£11300](http://news.fool.co.uk//school/calculators/calc1.asp?mode=one&amp;monthly=50&amp;year=17&amp;lump=1100&amp;rate=0.01&amp;submit=calculate) in todays money, all of which came from your £50pm. Now to be fair, savings rates have generally been higher than this for the past 17years, but the point is savings are not currently inflation-beating (all-time low), and even if they rise soon, I'm betting they won't be beating it by much for a while. Then again, see /u/sevenofk9 answer for some high rates on small values you can get at the moment.

As for the riskier S&amp;S, this is essentially how pensions work as they've also got the guarantee you won't withdraw for decades. The quote I've seen is that S&amp;S have historically outperformed savings if not withdrawn for five years in 80% of cases, this only increases the longer you leave it and 17yrs is definitely a long time, so your S&amp;S becomes almost as low-risk as pensions. The extreme early retirement guys (who tend to play it safe-ish) aim for a minimum after-inflation rate of 4%, making your child savings £16700 rather than £11300 in todays money, still assuming you increase your monthly contributions with inflation.

NB: Even having said all that, I'm new to this S&amp;S side of things having been brought up ultra risk-averse, though I'm saving for a house deposit so I can get away without thinking long-term for the next two years.

true,barejokez,null,null,"you've pretty much described the classic problem with investing. if you want returns, you have to be prepared to take risk (ie: the risk of not achieving those returns, and losing the original investment).

The answer which you probably don't want to hear is that you should probably (re)consider the idea of investing in equity, for example a FTSE100 tracker in an S&amp;S ISA. 17 years is a long time, and the potential exists for such an investment to be worth much, much more than what you're projecting.  but of course, there is the risk of a stock market crash, and it's actually quite a high likelihood over a 17 year time period that you will see at least one of these. then again, it's also likely that performance for the rest of the period will offset that.  But NO GUARANTEES, and that is the issue you are grappling with. 

the actual answer to your question is that i doubt you'll be able to do much better than a 3% return without accepting some sort of risk (i'm not counting bank/government guaranteed income as a risk btw). NS and I have a 5 year children's bond paying 2.5% tax free, which looks marginally better than what you're currently getting, and there might be some other bank accounts out there that beat that, though i would be surprised if they promise to do so for a period of 5 years.

As a final point, i note you have a mortgage. something for you to think about is that you could argue that your family's primary investment criteria is to achieve a return at least as high as your mortgage interest rate.  Ie: if your mortgage bank is charging you 3%, then putting your money into a bank account (in anyone's name) that pays 2% is inefficient.  what you could do, if you genuinely don't want to look at stocks but can't beat your mortgage rate, is use your son's money to prepay the mortgage. you could set up a fairly simple spreadsheet that tracks the amount your son 'pays' in, and the interest he's earning by you not having to pay the bank. that comes with its own issues, but the option exists for you to consider. Even if you don't, it's a useful way to look at your own money habits, and i'd suggest you also think about your own 2% ISA vs your mortgage in the same way.",0,1399637987,null,0,false,0,chdkcfk,t3_25461e,t1_chdkcfk,t3_25461e,null,1433720267,4,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,4

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;I would disagree with this. Smith believed that human beings were fundamentally self-interested, Marx believed the opposite. They are competing theories rather than one being a refinement of the other. I'd argue that Smith led to Hayekian economics rather than anything left-wing.

Well, for a start, Smith's was (I think) the first, and one of the most important labour theories of value.  Before starting his magnum opus, Capital, Marx spent a great deal of time and effort providing an detailed analysis of previous theories of political economy, and he gave a lot of space and plaudits to Smith in particular, he used Smith's work as a launchpad for his later writings because he felt and his analysis demonstrated that Smith simply hadn't recognised the full consequences of his theories.

Hayek is an Austrian economist.  Austrian economics these days is a fairly minor school outside of the neoclassical mainstream, but, if anything, its history is most closely associated with the fundamental and outright rejection of labour theories of value like those of Smith, Ricardo and Marx, and their replacement with subjectivism and marginalism.

&gt;I presume you are talking about the function of the state? Otherwise I'm not really sure what you'd mean by this.

Well, for one, that, because of the way economics is taught, at least at a beginners' level, that everyone remembers the wonders of efficiency at the pin factory with its division of labour, but never the potential horrors of it which Smith also recognised and took pains to warn us of:

""In the progress of the division of labour, the employment of the far greater part of those who live by labour, that is, of the great body of the people, comes to be confined to a few very simple operations, frequently to one or two. But the understandings of the greater part of men are necessarily formed by their ordinary employments. The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations, of which the effects are perhaps always the same, or very nearly the same, has no occasion to exert his understanding or to exercise his invention in finding out expedients for removing difficulties which never occur. He naturally loses, therefore, the habit of such exertion, and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become. The torpor of his mind renders him not only incapable of relishing or bearing a part in any rational conversation, but of conceiving any generous, noble, or tender sentiment, and consequently of forming any just judgment concerning many even of the ordinary duties of private life. Of the great and extensive interests of his country he is altogether incapable of judging, and unless very particular pains have been taken to render him otherwise, he is equally incapable of defending his country in war. The uniformity of his stationary life naturally corrupts the courage of his mind, and makes him regard with abhorrence the irregular, uncertain, and adventurous life of a soldier. It corrupts even the activity of his body, and renders him incapable of exerting his strength with vigour and perseverance in any other employment than that to which he has been bred. His dexterity at his own particular trade seems, in this manner, to be acquired at the expense of his intellectual, social, and martial virtues. But in every improved and civilised society this is the state into which the labouring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall, unless government takes some pains to prevent it.""

&gt;1- If there is no demand for Michael Gove's free schools, as Labour pretends, why are there three applications for every single place?

You're framing unfairly by dealing in absolutes - ""no demand"" rather than ""little demand"". While there will obviously be *some* demand for free schools, I would argue however the demand is for 'high quality' schools, whether they be free, private, or even Mormon. It is the concept that people take issue with, but not enough of an issue to override a desire for a high quality school (see atheists in catholic schools).

&gt;2- if Iain Duncan Smith's welfare reform are cruel and ineffectual, why are there more people working now than at any point in British history?

Are you defining ""more"" in percentage terms, or in absolute terms? If it is the latter, then it's simply a matter of a larger population size. If it is the former, you are just wrong. Unemployment is at ~7%. The lowest it has ever been since 1971 is 3.4%. (http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/unemployment-rate)

Furthermore, it is unfair to link welfare reform to unemployment so directly.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; 1- If there is no demand for Michael Gove's free schools, as Labour pretends, why are there three applications for every single place?

This is a misleading statement.  Free schools tend to be set up when parents are unhappy with the existing schools because of their reputation, so alternatives are heavily subscribed.  Faith Free schools are set up so that they can choose 50% of their pupils, so they are of course going to take the cream of the crop and that will encourage parents to want to go there.  They are for profit businesses and wouldn't be set up in places where there was no demand because they wouldn't make a profit.  I went to a grant maintained selective school and they were heavily oversubscribed too, whilst it was good for me individually, I can see that to a society as a whole it isn't.

&gt; 2- if Iain Duncan Smith's welfare reform are cruel and ineffectual, why are there more people working now than at any point in British history?

I can understand the concerns, and all of these problems do currently apply to the army as it stands. It is also a good reason to tread carefully but not to never try. Working your way to the top by sex is not substantially different from the guy who knows the right people to make it there, or gets a shine from a particular person. Sex jokes are something that will work out with integration, and almost definitely will work out in little time.

This also already occurs with secondary roles and is definitely not a reason to stop women entering, rather have sufficient checks to prevent it from happening (which should already be the case).

Relationships and sex are the big obvious issues. If this is to be truly effective, there shouldn't be gender segregation in living, sleeping, washing, eating, whatever. Particularly in units that will be working together. Relationships are definitely a problem, and relate very closely to the possessiveness and exclusivity of sexual relationships. But education, training, and counseling (which should be happening anyway) will all help to deal with that.

It will certainly form an interesting set of problems for people who know more than myself about the workings of the armed forces to deal with and encourage further social change. I can't see these social reasons as making it something we shouldn't broach, nor do I think implementation of these rules will cause the military to fail.

Wages are higher in London, but those wages will get eaten up by either

a) increased cost of accommodation in London  
b) travelling in and out of London every day

Both seem to cost not too far off the same. Sure you might save £100 a month going one way or the other, but after a few months of settling into the change you're not going to notice/miss it.

Living outside of London, you've got an hour (or more) commute each way (even a 20min train to the nearest station is a 10+ minute walk to the office and a 10-20 walk to the station at home).  
Living inside London, you've got lots of people and are close to work. Heading out for a pint or two of an evening is a certainty.

IMO if you're going as far as working in the seething mass that is London, you're best off enjoying the active/social lifestyle in there and becoming part of the seething mass.

You realize that's ridiculous right. You've NEVER run into someone on the street that looks like someone you know?

&gt;You're saying that UNIT found some guy who looked like the Doctor, trained him in all things alien and made him Curator...because he looks like the Doctor.

No, they would have chosen him however they choose employees. 

&gt;Since when does the Doctor have a diary? River Song had a diary, but it's stuck in the Library surrounded by Vashta Nerada in the 51st century.

Have you even been watching? 11 (and maybe 10, but it's been a while) has been on-screen writing in the diary (that he eventually gives to River). Him and River even both have it on screen during the Utah episode. 

&gt;Even so, it likely only went part way through 11's lifetime. UNIT does NOT have the ability to time travel, and the Doctor certainly wouldn't give them **Jack's vortex manipulator** that Clara took from the Black Archive.

Oh look, they do have the ability to time travel. 

&gt;REALLY old in Doctor Who is far greater than any human lifetime. Even if this guy became Curator in his 20s, that's still only 50 or 60 years. And who said that ""scarf girl""(Osgood) is his granddaughter? She's probably the granddaughter of Tom Osgood, who served under the Brigadier.

I meant really old for a human, which he is. Now that I think about it, I don't think she's his granddaughter, that was something on here. 

&gt;Also how does he know that the painting's true name is ""Gallifrey Falls No More""?
Why did he specifically seek out the Doctor to tell him that?
How does he know that Gallifrey didn't fall?
Why doesn't the rest of UNIT know the painting's true name?
How did he acquire the painting? Did he leave earth to do so?
Why is he being so evasive about telling the Doctor what he should do, if he's not a future Doctor who doesn't want to interfere too much with his own time line?

Maybe he decided it made sense to combine the two known names, or whoever he acquired it from (in whatever manner) told him. How does UNIT acquire ANY of their stuff? They have one of River's shoes from the future, yet they can't time travel (according to you)?

&gt;UNIT knows a lot relative to other humans but they know nothing about traveling through space and time. How would they know anything about Gallifrey?
UNIT only knows what has happened until today. They know nothing about the future.

So the net change in the budget, when compared with inflation, is negative resulting in the NHS having to cut services.

I understand yes they gave them a bit more money but if they NHS had to cut services because they don't have the money to maintain them then we aren't experiencing the same level of function and so they have been cut.

Many of their points against GMO are just intentionally misleading:

You get herbicide resistant ""super weeds"" with or without GMO.

&gt; (c) Herbicides used with GM crops have been shown to harm both wildlife and human health.

Herbicides used with non-GM crops are harmful too!

If you go and drink weed killer, that's obviously not going to do you any good.  Whether it's weed killer for GM crops or not.

And they want to effectively destroy GM:

Why not the same ""strict liability"" for non-GM companies and farmers?  Why single out GM here?

true,Drackion,eng-manchester,Not Salford,"I haven't seen said Spectator article, but here's a couple of points on the issues:

1) I'm not sure if it's a case of no demand, or whether Labour as a whole thinks it's not a good idea (I know some have claimed there's no demand, but I'm not sure if that's representative of Labour/'The left' as a whole). From my understanding, alot of the things trumpeted in the idea of free schools is that they will 'drive up standards' and 'give parents a better choice in the type of education a child receives'. 

The idea of education standards being driven up is open to some debate I think. There seems to be mixed evidence suggesting that schools being free from local authority control will have any real effect on the standards of teaching. What's concerning to a lot of people is how that free schools can alter their curriculum to reflect a specific view point (eg. Religious schools); employ staff who may not necessarily be qualified teachers; as well as being overall less accountable.

There also seems to be fewer free schools being setup in deprived areas. How does this policy then benefit those people living in these areas? I grant that some see the flexibility in the curriculum as being a good thing also; but, surely that undermines the idea of a 'national curriculum' of things that pupils in schools need/ought to be taught? There's also the issue of private companies running schools - are these being run in the best interests of the pupils there or are they run to maximise profit? Recently, the public accounts committee have also said that the not enough is being done to ensure that the public funding these schools receive is being used properly, and that less than half of free schools have submitted their financial records for scrutiny on time. Is this really how we want public money to be spent?

I suspect that places will be high for a number of reasons. Children still need to go to school, and more school places are going to be needed as our population rises. I suspect a lot more free schools have opened in areas where demand for places is already high, and that, the opposition won't discourage parents from sending children to these new schools if they believe them to be better than others on offer (though we won't be able to tell this until a few years down the line of course).

2) I suspect this one is more the way that we treat/see the treatment of benefits claimants in the media. There was a piece posted on here a while ago I think which suggested that ""poverty has been re-branded a personal failure"" (or similar). It kind of seems that recently, we treat or should treat anyone of benefits with contempt because they are effectively scrounging off the current system, rather than choosing to work. Programs like Benefits Street have only reinforced this view in my opinion.

I don't see that as being the case. The idea of welfare is to be a safety net for people in times of hardship surely. The vast majority of people don't want to be on benefits. Yes, there are a minority of people who try and gain the system, but I don't think it's representative of the system as a whole. Why do they occupy the focus of the benefits debate so much? I'm not advocating money be wasted, sure, but it seems there are many other areas where money could be much more effectively recouped than chasing after this shrinking minority of people claiming benefits fraudulently. What about all the people who could claim benefits but don't? What about tax avoidance, pensions, etc? 

To add to all this, a lot of the focus seems to be getting people off benefits rather than into work itself, as well a whole lot of new laws and regulations which only aim to make life worse for people receiving payments. There are countless posts/stories I've read here and elsewhere which seem to talk about how payments have been stopped because of missed appointments, then not restarted for weeks later; people being declared fit for work by ATOS who quite clearly aren't; money for people who are disabled no longer being available due to changes in the rules (bedroom tax, council tax support reduction, reforms to general disability benefit etc); etc, etc. Are we trying to make the welfare state effective and make it a robust platform to support those who really need it; or are we just seeking to bring down spending by any means necessary, even if we effectively 'abandon' a few people in the process?

Anyway, more specifically answering your question. I suspect it's linked to the economic upturn as of late, so yes more people will be going back in employment hopefully. I'm also not sure of the statistics of zero hour contracts, so that might be contributing to it somewhat. There's also the other statistics question that need to be asked. Is this the proportion of people working, or just the actual number of those employed? If so, surely with a growing population you'd expect more to be working now than ever before.

I feel like I've kind of splurged somewhat, so I'll leave it there. I'll be happy to provide some sources of some kind later if you wish.

It should also be obvious that if you are making hyperbolic claims, then either something has not been clarified, or something has been misunderstood.

Fighting against gender roles directly requires two directional work, and having adverts with men being called creamy (ha sexual innuendo) is hardly on the same level as barring a gender from a particular role.

The rest of the post devolves rapidly into ad homenim attacks which doesn't add anything to the debate, but I will pick out the points you make.

I don't really entertain anecdotal evidence, nor do I deny that pregnancy is a problem if contraception is not provided. Complaining about anti-depressants is quite frankly ridiculous considering depression in war is extremely common amongst men as well. Counseling, education, and training all help reduce these issues, and it is quite possible that a lack of these things mean easily solvable problems don't get solved. None of this actually addresses why women shouldn't be allowed in these roles though.

The compounding effect will be greater if you can get a better interest rate or if you include inflation or if you need a larger deposit (though consider moving in 3+ years if that's an option). You're also missing about £27 from your budget, unless you're paying pension contributions of £33.

Speaking of pension, you should at least contribute as much as your employer will match, as this is a free pay-rise with the only tradeoff of it contributing to your retirement rather than house! General rule of thumb says aim to contribute half your age at start of pension for a comfortable-ish retirement, so 15%, or £369.

As for what to do with the cash, you can currently get a better rate by withdrawing your cash from the ISA into [current accounts to earn 6.7%+ pre-tax](http://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/252iyd/i_am_financially_illiterate_and_have_exactly_6000/chd5p4g).

My point is that a prepared press release, which may have been read out, was reported as speech/question at press conference, instead of being reported as a press release.

PR people and journalists should be on opposing sides.  When you report a press release verbatim without mentioning your cut and paste job you destroy integrity.

The Huffington Post make it clear that this is a prepared statement.  Now the BBC are worse jornalists that the HuffPo.   

&gt;The authority said in a statement: ""We have seen no evidence to suggest that Uber London Ltd are not fit and proper to hold a London private hire vehicle operator's licence, but no final decisions have been made whilst Uber's operating model is still under investigation.""

&gt;Uber operates in more than 100 cities across 30 countries, and has rapidly grown in popularity for allowing customers to pay by card in advance of their journey. It also promotes its safety features, allowing customers to see the name and photo of a driver, and allows friends to follow the cab's journey on a map.

&gt;""Uber, funded by Google, Goldman Sachs and others, has a stated aim of challenging legislation that is not compatible with its business model,"" continued McNamara.

&gt;""This is not some philanthropic friendly society, it's an American monster that has no qualms about breaching any and all laws in the pursuit of profit, most of which will never see a penny of tax paid in the UK.""",0,1399639912,null,0,false,0,chdkw46,t3_251dbj,t1_chdkw46,t1_chdkek0,null,1433720524,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

**Video - Quality ENG camera** with excellent low light performance and preferably around a 20x telephoto lens and a top-mounted microphone. We've found that some professional camcorders such as the Sony EX series lack suitable low-light performance, especially when zoomed.

We also equip our operators with a zoom demand and SD monitor, as often the camera has to be racked right up on the tripod to get over the audience so the built in viewfinder is not visible. A quality tripod is also vital as smooth pans are very common.

You'd need to be able to post the media back to us after each performance via signed for Royal Mail, which you would be able to claim for when you invoice for the job.

Large-chip cameras (such as DSLRs) have too shallow a depth of field for the job.


**Sound - A SM58 microphone , Stand, and wireless plug.**
#This is normally placed at the front of the stage to pick up tap dance, vocals, etc, though sometimes the wireless plug is used to get feed audio from a sound desk that is too far for the camera for a cable. You'll also need a good stock of cables and adapters


Work is very seasonal, and weekends tend to be the busiest, though there are also daytime and early morning shows for infant/junior schools. There's no guarantee there will be any jobs offered on a per-month basis, though we try to be as fair with the distribution as possible while still being practical. If you're a midlands based operator though, you'll be first pick for jobs in that area.

Around our busiest periods (Easter, Summer, and Christmas), our operators normally get 5-7 jobs each per month, though there can also be months without jobs in the less busy times.

Whist working for us, your equipment will be covered by our hired-in equipment insurance, and you would be covered by our public liability insurance, but I'd still suggest you had personal insurance in place as that's good practice for any camera operator.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May#Controversies

&gt;**In June 2012,** May was found to be in contempt of court by Judge, Barry Cotter, QC, and stood accused of 'totally unacceptable and regrettable behaviour' having said to have shown complete disregard to a legal agreement to free an Algerian from a UK immigration detention centre. As she eventually allowed the prisoner to be freed, May avoided further sanctions including fines or imprisonment.

&gt;**In November 2013,** May removed the passport of Hilal Al Jedda, although he had won an appeal in the Supreme Court in November 2013. The Supreme Court had ruled that removing Al Jedda's passport was illegal. He had come to the UK as an asylum seeker in 1992; he originally lost his British passport in 2007 after three years in military detention in Iraq. Al Jedda is the first person to have his citizenship removed twice.

&gt;**May has come under criticism** by Labour and Human rights organizations over her comments about a deportation case involving a man who fought deportation by providing details of his relationship with a woman from the UK, including the fact they had a pet cat.

&gt;May used the case as an example in an attack on the Human Rights Act and Article 8 that an illegal immigrant avoided deportation because of his pet cat, saying ""We all know the stories about the Human Rights Act... about the illegal immigrant who cannot be deported because, and I am not making this up, he had a pet cat."" However, a spokesman for the Judicial Office at the Royal Courts of Justice, which issues statements on behalf of senior judges, said the pet had ""had nothing to do with"" the judgement allowing the man to stay.

&gt;Human rights campaigners criticised the comment and said May ""urgently needs to get her facts straight"", while Amnesty International said May's comments only fuelled ""myths and misconceptions"" about the Human Rights Act and ""That someone in Theresa May's position can be so misinformed as to parade out a story about someone being allowed to stay in Britain because of a cat is nothing short of alarming.""

She also wanted to deport Trenton Oldfield because he jumped into the water at the University boat race and caused the two teams to have to wait half an hour before the race could begin. As a result of this lone incident, from a man who has worked and raised a family here, Theresa May wanted to deport him because she considered him ""not conducive to the public good"": http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/10/trenton-oldfield-boat-race-protester-theresa-may-deportation",0,1399640445,null,0,1399641039,0,chdl23p,t3_254h4l,t1_chdl23p,t3_254h4l,null,1433720601,77,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,77

The only thing that's really stopping Hinkley Point C from going ahead at this point is if the deal agreed between EDF and the government is in violation of EU law (competition regulations). We should expect a ruling on it later this year. It's worth bearing in mind France is heavily invested in Nuclear, and Germany's situation with regard to energy prices hasn't faired too well since they went down the non-nuclear route; so it's potentially not all doom and gloom on that front. 

Beyond that, there are yet more plans to build more reactors, with newer designs going through the process of approval for build in the UK by companies other than EDF (Hitachi-GE who own Horizon Nuclear Power, and Nu Gen which I think is owned 50% by Toshiba). And yes, cost is a problem I won't deny, especially because Nuclear is not a short term option.

I think the problem of decommissioning is more that it was, or at least seems to have been, really badly managed in the past. The trouble was that the concern was more to ""get things done, sort out the waste/problems later"". Hence why Sellafield, for example, will end up costing so much money to clean up. The culture behind this is a lot different now, decommissioning needs to be taken into account when designing and building new reactors/nuclear facilities.

In regards to the fund itself, I'm less knowledgeable about the specifics; but there is the *Nuclear Liabilties Fund*, which is responsible for providing the funding for decommissioning of the 8 most recent power stations in the UK. It's a separate trust, which I think is owned by the government (I'm not familiar with the legal terms).

(Explanation for those not familiar with the term: marginal cost is the price of producing one additional unit. Imagine a production run of a thousand discs. That's the plant's minimum order size in this hypothetical.

If they all sell, great, time to order some more! Looks like we could sell another 500!

Except the cost of each additional one isn't just 1/1000th of the price. The order can't be less than a thousand. Argh.

Furthermore any left over units have to be moved through the supply chain and be got rid of. All the ones that sold also had to go through that. It might not be the same people footing the bill but ultimately that cost of doing business factors into the costings and what a distributor is willing to pay.

In the digital age one can distribute as many units as are demanded. The cost of offering 500 additional units is barely any different from offering 5000. Bandwidth is cheap and there's no manufacturing, distribution, or anything else like that to worry about (e.g. sales staff). That is to say, comparatively the marginal cost of the digital goods is near zero. It's obviously not zero, but it's not far off. )",0,1399641078,null,0,false,0,chdl98g,t3_253vur,t1_chdl98g,t1_chdi2o2,null,1433720696,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

true,ParrotofDoom,english,Greater Manchester,"&gt; Because the 1.5 tonnes of metal+plastic gets you there in a fit state to start work, whatever the weather... (and because most commuters are going a hell of a lot further than 2-3 miles!)

So does a bicycle, and as for commuting distance, you are absolutely incorrect:

http://data.gov.uk/dataset/distance_travelled_to_work

 49% of the population in England and Wales travel less than 5 km to work
 68% of the population in England and Wales travel less than 10 km to work
 83% of the population in England and Wales travel less than 20 km to work

&gt; Good luck carrying a big TV, a fridge, or even your weekly grocery shopping on a bike. Or even a suit and briefcase... as you're gonna have to get changed when you arrive at work (and most offices lack suitable changing/shower facilities for those cycling in bad weather - and both hot and wet weather are 'bad' )

A big television can be delivered for £25 or so.  Grocery shopping is easy with a bicycle trailer.  And no, you don't have to get changed at work, especially if you're only doing 5 miles or so.  Only people who have no experience of cycling propagate these myths.

&gt; But for most, it's not a very practical option

You're clearly speaking for yourself and not the majority of the population.  Millions of people want to cycle to work but are too afraid of the roads.

&gt; Now if electric cars really don't work out, and more and more people are priced off the roads, then maybe a lot more people will turn to bikes. Alternatively, they'll choose to live closer to work/work closer to home (or end up going to London, where public transport exists)

Electric cars won't work out because they'll still be very expensive to run (the government will simply tax people per mile travelled by car), and there's a finite amount of space on the roads.  And people aren't going to move closer to work, because there aren't the houses to move into.",0,1399641369,null,0,false,0,chdlcvf,t3_251abt,t1_chdlcvf,t1_chd5n4w,null,1433720743,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

But they're right, you can't give these rumours too much credence yet, but stranger things have happened.

Put it this way;

He's a close friend of Zabaleta. When Zabaleta played for Espanyol (another Catalan club) they became good friends. Messi has asked him about life in Manchester in passing before (as per Zabaleta, the quotes are out there).

He's a close friend of Aguero.

There's a strong Spanish speaking contingent at City; Yaya, Garcia, Silva, Zabaleta, Aguero, Demichelis, Navas, Negredo, even Milner speaks Spanish(!).

Settling shouldn't be a problem.

He's expressed an interest in the Premier League before, and I wouldn't be surprised if he had ambitions of playing here one day.

I'm honestly not sure about free schools either, I was just trying to voice some of the concerns as I see them. I'm sure there's something to be said for it, but a lot of the things that have happened, particularly the business with religious schools are quite worrying (but then I think education should be secular). If they are to work, there most likely needs to be higher level of scrutiny available; but then that probably defeats the point of them in the first place.

As for your second suggestion; yeah, perhaps to an extent, but then consider the circumstances by which people might be on benefits. Some people will have no other skills, or not that many options open to them, so yes such a scheme might be beneficial in this case. If you've just left school and signed on then I don't see why not in this case, it'd be a good thing to do to keep you occupied if there are no other apprenticeships, training courses, etc, available.

But consider what if someone has signed on after being in work for several years? They probably already have a certain set of skills developed. They might need to retrain, sure, but I doubt very much working in a park is going to be all that useful. Also, how do we set-up a scheme to be fair to those people who've had to leave work because of an accident/illness, or otherwise aren't as physically able? Also, consider that it might impact the ability of some to look for work in a specific area too, if they need to book time off go to to job interviews/do other voluntary work that would support an application into a specific area.

&gt;The people actively trying to prevent UKIP's ability to speak are worried that too many members of the public will agree with them. So rather than try to debate the issues they just try to stop the message. That is wrong.

I actually don't think that in this instance the campaign is about trying to stop the message, I think it's about responding to it, but that aside for a minute..

If someone is putting out a hateful, or racist message (ukip, bnp, edl, kkk, whoever you like) I can see how it would be entirely legitimate to want to stop that. Not all speech is equal, and not all ideas are worthy of public debate. I'm sure you've heard the metaphor of [""Shouting 'fire' in a crowded theatre""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shouting_fire_in_a_crowded_theater), and plenty of speech can have the same effect. Especially messages that can create division and distrust within communities. 

It's for that reason that I don't agree that trying to stop the message is always necessarily wrong, but I also don't think that's what is happening in this case.

It's useful to know for comparison that although premium bonds are not ISAs, the payouts are tax-free and currently are equivalent to 1.3% on average.

If this sounds too complicated for you, then feel free to ask questions, the easiest part is to just shift £1250 per month from NS&amp;I to Nationwide ISA regular saver.

Absolutely. The British were one of the first nations to start helping their own citizens in times of turmoil on other countries soil. Canada for instance only recently started evacuating their citizens from foreign soil. Prior to that if you were Canadian during Rwanda/Iraq etc. you had to hope British/American/European armed forces would risk extending their genorosity because the Canadian government wasn't coming for you. It is absolutely a privilege and one that a lot of countries to this day don't afford their citizens.

&gt;But both groups are British people. You'd be horrified if the CIA kidnapped a member of your family tomorrow and held them in Guantanamo bay for years without charging them with a single offense. 

I'm actually vehemently against Guantanamo. I believe they should be released or they should be trialled. And I think it's absolutely disgusting that 86 inmates in Guantanamo have been cleared for release running over 7 years now.

In the **exact** same way I believe a brit, if captured, should receive a trial and be imprisoned or released based on that trial and that those trials should happen in a timely manner.

&gt;Him and River even both have it on screen during the Utah episode.
My mistake.  Didn't remember that one.  So in your head canon, UNIT has the Doctor's diary and knows all about his future?

&gt;Oh look, they do have the ability to time travel.
Prior to the Day of the Doctor, they were missing the base code to use the vortex manipulator, and even when they got it, there was only enough power for one trip.  The Black Archive is full of things that the Doctor DOESN'T want humans to have.  That's why it's TARDIS-proof.  I'm guessing that not only did he not return the vortex manipulator to them after that episode, but took away everything dangerous that they had in the archive.  Alien technology and human stupidity - you can't beat it.

&gt;Maybe he decided it made sense to combine the two known names, or whoever he acquired it from (in whatever manner) told him. How does UNIT acquire ANY of their stuff? They have one of River's shoes from the future, yet they can't time travel (according to you)?

The whole point of the Curator talking to 11 was to tell him that Gallifrey didn't fall.  How would some simple old human know for certain that Gallifrey didn't fall?

As for UNIT's Black Archive, much of what I noticed were objects acquired from alien invasions.  River has visited the 21st century enough times to leave her shoes behind. That's more believable than UNIT traveling to the 51st century to steal them from her.

I would strongly urge you not to vote UKIP. I should say I'm not allied to any party. They have, thus far, one policy. Do you know their stance on the NHS? Personal finance? Welfare? The environment? 

Let's all acknowledge that they have been successful because they've engaged the public on something that bothers them, that the others haven't addressed adequately. Namely the influence of the EU. But please don't feel that just because you agree on that that they represent you. 

Farage seems to be an eloquent and intelligent man. But look beyond him. Have you seen a SINGLE UKIP member acquit themselves well in a public forum? The string of racist and small minded shit coming from their twitters and interviews is appalling. 

I don't think I've heard him say anything racist. But his agenda is fundamentally discriminatory. He's also a hypocrite, he employs a non British national, despite saying that he's against giving jobs to foreigners. This person happens to be his wife.

Farage has done a good job as setting himself up as the chain smoking, ale supping, champion of middle England, he's rather charismatic, and if it was just based on him, they would have a rather good chance at the next general election.

UKIP as a party have two major problems...

1) whilst farage may not seem to be racist, a proportion of his candidates  standing for election at the local and European level are either racist or holding increasingly stupid beliefs,  a couple of notable examples are [the man who claimed date rate victims should take responsibitly for there actions] (http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/06/ukip-selects-former-tory-roger-helmer-parliamentary-candidate), or [the ukip candidate asying lenny henry should go emigrate to a ""black"" Country] (http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27176803)

2) UKIP manifesto is based on two things, immigration and leaving the EU, but avoids some more complex issues for example the EU open border policy works both ways and many people have taken advantage of it to work in Europe and even move to other parts of Europe, and immigration, like the so called scourge of benefits scroungers avoids bigger issues which are political hot potatoes like large copraorations avoiding huge sums of tax, and often paying less than 1% on Profits (thats profits)

&gt; Sure, and (following that logic) we're all organisms so killing a person is no different from killing a plant. Delude yourself if you like, but it won't work on others.

I'm deluded for recognising humans are not some special organism that is above everything else like you seem to think?

&gt; It's not really about you since you're not the one getting killed, that's kind of the point. This does not change because you're the one lucky enough to be eating it.

It is about me since the animal is in the situation it is in for the sole purpose of me eating it, there is no other reason whatsoever for the animal to be there but for my enjoyment. If you don't want to be cruel, don't put it in that position to begin with.

The reason is because practically anything is allowed on the ballot as long as you show a clear preference for a candidate. The only thing that will get your ballot counted as ""spoiled"" is if you do not show a clear preference or you write your personal details on the ballot paper.

They show you them all so you agree none of them show a clear preference, which occasionally can be a matter of debate.

It was glaringly obvious that he wasn't interested in performing a cyber-attack on America, but she would've been happy to see a heavily autistic man thrown into a US prison, where even his most basic rights woud've been ignored.

She's always been perfectly okay with the idea of abandoning British citizens to foreign powers, so it doesn't surprise me that she'll want to have the power to make British citizens stateless. The only one guilty of treason is her. If *anybody* deserves to have their passport revoked, it's her.

true,TychoBraheNose,eu,London (UCL),"They aren't officially racist, anymore. Unfortunately they've undergone some rapid changes and are still shaking the racists out of the woodwork. Farage *completely* disowned the 2010 election party manifesto, of which highlights can be read here:

http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/jan/23/the-ukip-politices-disowned-by-nigel-farage

&gt; Restricting foreigners on football teams (maximum 3 per team)
&gt;
&gt; Investigating discrimination against white people at the BBC
&gt;
&gt; Cancelling visas for failure to uphold British values

etc.

Unfortunately all of the 2010 supporters are still affiliated with the party, and whilst many new voters have been drawn in by the lack of the ridiculous policies, as they have no manifesto we have no idea whether it is all a ploy to lure in voters before reverting back to the lunacy. The idea that a party *without any real manifesto* could win the largest share of the vote in the European elections is a pretty sad reflection on the state of our countries politics, rather than a result of the merits of UKIP.

If you go to the UKIP website, and under 'getINFORMED' select the 'European manifesto' you are greeted with a whole 8 pages, almost all of which are pictures and titles, and only two of which contain any information. This 'information' states that UKIP will regain control of our borders through immigration control, save our public services from EU overcrowding, and get rid of the 2008 climate change act to prevent potential blackouts (as in power cuts, not minorities breaking curfew - sorry, cheap shot). I am not shitting you, that is almost all the manifesto says. 

The idea that UKIP ""are the only party I see that has the bollocks to actually do what they claim they will"" is wholly misguided, even if your heart is in the right place. Firstly, they don't actually have a record of what they say they'll do, having completely ditched their last manifesto, and have as bad a reputation for distorting numbers and facts as any of the three main parties. 

Currently UKIP are not openly racist, but they do attract racists and have a build up of racists from the last election they are still shaking out. Whilst they have appeared to come down hard and disown racist members when the media are watching, they tend to be quite sympathetic and turn a blind eye before the media picks up on it. I'm sure there are loads of non-racist UKIP members, however.

I would recommend looking into the Green party, however. I myself am rather critical of them because of their stance on some science policy, which along with education is my main factor in deciding who to vote for. However, they are a much better alternative to UKIP because they are pro-active. They *have* a manifesto, and a great track record of standing up for their policies. UKIP aren't interested in getting anything out of the EU, and have among the worst no-show voting records in the whole of the EU. Many of the things Farage complained about the EU doing in the TV debates with Clegg included things that he didn't even show up to vote against - not that UKIP would have changed the outcome, but it doesn't set a good example and prevents us from getting anything out of Europe. The Green party have promised an in-out referendum on the EU, but they don't have hidden racists and climate change denial policies. 

Ultimately voting UKIP doesn't make you racist, but for the vast majority of people supporting a more pro-active party with a manifesto would almost certainly be a better alternative.

It depends on your definition of ""London""; the built-up area of London stretches out as far as the M25 and beyond, but most newcomers to the city wouldn't consider somewhere 15 miles out from the West End as London. It is though, really.

So assuming you're using the definition of London as ""within just a few miles of the city centre"" then the answer to your question is, unfortunately, a resounding ""no"". Remember over eight million people live in this city and a large percentage of them want to be near the centre, that kind of huge demand sends prices spiralling sky-high.

You might want to consider looking at places south of the river, traditionally the lack of tube access has kept prices lower there but even so in the last 5 years there's been huge housing cost inflation in places like Brixton, Peckham, Elephant, Vauxhall.  There are very few cheaper areas left until you get to at least ten miles out from the city, to be honest.

Vegetarianism isn't the answer, dairy has just as much suffering as anything else.

Veganism isn't the answer because it opposes the use of insects/bugs. It would be great for the environment if people ate these, anyone who complains about the bugs ""suffering"" is an idiot.

My point was not at all--at all--that they are going to spend £80 or £100 million. My point was that they don't operate based solely on budgets. They have said time and again that their budget is based on the market, not even necessarily Liverpool's needs. If there is value, they have money. If there isn't, they don't. 

Budgeting in business is important, but the market doesn't fluctuate as much as it does in football transfers. If you need something for your business, it is usually always available and available to multiple buyers. Henry knows that if he were to give a newspaper a budget of $500k for new printing equipment or computers, they will spend it. Perhaps they will go out and find a really great product for cheap and maximize the amount. Or maybe they'll just go buy everyone an iPad Air and throw away the budget unwisely. But in either case, they will spend the money they are given. 

This is the opposite of what FSG has been trying to cultivate at Liverpool. They want you to go and find the value and the talent and make a case for the purchase. If you make a good case and the value is there, you will have your money. Telling BR, before really delving into targets and talking to clubs seriously, that he has £X million to spend is manufacturing value. BR will want to add to the squad regardless of the talent available, and he'll feel pressure to get targets in early. By taking the focus away from money and placing it on talent, you ease the pressure of the manager to go after certain types of players and to instead focus on the best players for his system, regardless of price. It also makes it so the transfer committee's work is never ""done,"" as they have never completely spent their budget.

Lets examine the achievements of the said council since its inception back in the 40s ... oh wait ... there are none. Its essentially US, China and Russia vetoing any substantial decision. And then you get things like the Iraq war where the NATO led by US essentially gave a big finger to the Security Council. The Security Council has been the biggest failure of UN. 

&gt; The vast majority of terrorism in the UK has nothing to do with Iraq or Afghanistan.

I am not British by birth. I was born in Pakistan so I can give you a bit of perspective from my side. We're much closer to the war and if anything Pakistan has been the most affected NATO ally in this entire war against terrorism. Over the 30 - 40 years, starting with the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, the Islamic radicalism has seen more and more funding and its getting stronger and stronger. For the most part, up until the late 90s it was directly funded and later on indirectly supported by the US up until 9/11. They directly funded these nut jobs. They fed the monster and the monster bit back. While I do not quite agree with the Green Party's stance, it is better than the stance of everyone else i.e. we don't have anything to do with this and we don't know why these crazies are after us. These crazies are after us because you created them, you fed them, used them and then ditched them. Its a subject very close to my heart because my country has been ripped apart by these savages. I can go on and on about this subject but I urge you to read some literature. This war is not 10 or 12 years old. This monstrosity was not created in the last decade and the fact that Britain and NATO played a very active part in its creation. 

I do not want to comment too much on the situation in Middle East. Its a fucked up zone and lots of parties are to be blamed for it including Isreal. I am not an expert on the subject and to be honest I don't care about it anymore. I lament the loss of life in the region but have resigned to the fact that the crisis is not going to get solved anytime soon. Whatever political stance you take over it is fine with me because there are so many parties responsible for the current state of affairs over there that you can selectively blame anyone for it.

The SNP have the the support in the majority of people in Scotland and the two leaders have the highest approval ratings of any MP's in the UK - are they racists? By extension, does this make the majority of Scottish people racist for voting them into power?

If, by this logic, UKIP won the European elections, would the people who voted them in be racists?

No of course not; that would be silly.

What I think you need to understand is that there is such a thing as **ethnic nationalism** - the Quebecois referendum on independence in the 1990's was predicated on this - and there is **civic nationalism**. Civic nationalism is what the SNP are basing the Scottish referendum on and what UKIP are basing their European campaign on.

Is it easy for the lines to be blurred? Sure, but to claim UKIP are intentionally racist is a gross simplification of their ideology. People have written tomes on the kind of ideology UKIP espouse; it's a legitimate view point, it just doesn't gel with the current status-quo and that's why many want to deride it.

I actually disagree with it, I'm a European federalist. Just thought I'd share my opinion.

Every party has a selection of extremists, just this month a lib dem councillor was convicted for racially aggravated assault, and a while back one was convicted for planting BOMBS. Labour and the tories both have ex-BNP councillors. If this were the case for UKIP, it would be front page news for days, and we'd never hear the end of it. 

The anti-UKIP people here don't like talking about stuff like that because it shows that every party has a few lunatics. The fact that a few morons in UKIP who have now been kicked out came out with racist comments, is not indicative of racist policies. It is a lie to say so and anyone here who claims as much is shamelessly dishonest.

There is NOTHING racist about wanting your country to have full control over its own laws. Even those on the far left concede that a good portion of our laws are made in Brussels. Those laws are proposed by a mostly unelected commission, of which we have one member, and are then voted on by the European parliament, of which we have roughly an 8% share of the vote.

The conservatives promise ""real change in Europe"" but they only do so because UKIP have forced their hand. There is no realistic way of negotiating with the EU, the commission is full of Europhile lunatics who want a United States of Europe and have said so on numerous occasions. 

Labour and the lib dems don't even want the British public to have a say on this issue, and they are both huge supporters of expanding the powers of the EU. Labour are now forced to admit that they made a mistake by promoting mass immigration from the 90s to the last day they were in power, but they've only been forced to admit this due to pressure from their traditional supporter base who aren't particularly happy about their communities being changed beyond all recognition, or their wages going down due to an oversupply of unskilled labour.

There is nothing racist about wanting to have a points based immigration system whereby we let people in based upon the skills they have, at a rate of roughly 30/50,000 a year, as opposed to our ridiculous situation we have at the moment where we have 500,000 migrants come here a year, and only 300,000 Brits leaving. The amount of immigrants coming here in the coming years is only going to go up and up as the economic situation in Greece and elsewhere gets even worse.

UKIP are the only party who would actually do anything about immigration. The conservatives don't really care, because it helps their friends in big business who can push wages down as a result.

Labour actually support mass-immigration because they can rely on the immigrant vote, and have done since the 90s.

And the lib dems love mass immigration because they are frankly so out of touch that they want to push the multicultural dream even if the majority of the British public don't want it and regardless of the economic and cultural consequences.

If you care about having a sensible, NON-RACIST immigration policy, UKIP are the ONLY party who would do anything about it.

It seems to work for you. Or so you appear to think.

&gt;I'm deluded for recognising humans are not some special organism that is above everything else like you seem to think?

Other animals have the brain capacity? Opposing thumbs? Shall I carry on? You can't list the similarities we have with other mammals and then assert that means there's no difference. One could say the same about carbon.

&gt;It is about me since the animal is in the situation it is in for the sole purpose of me eating it, there is no other reason whatsoever for the animal to be there but for my enjoyment.

No, it's not. You are not involved until it is on your plate - and even then, that doesn't make the treatment of the animal irrelevant just because you're the one that ends up eating it. People use that logic about dying *generally*, and it doesn't work for them either.

&gt; If you don't want to be cruel, don't put it in that position to begin with.

Polarisation doesn't change the reality.

&gt;Sigh, you were the one saying the majority decides what is right

No, I didn't.

Same as you would in any city, but the fact that London has an inflated economy, it means by default you would be able to make more doing it in London than elsewhere. I assume in a different city, that bedsit would be closer to about £40 per week or so, but you would also be making much less than you would in London.

What a dishonest representation of Helmer's article. What he said was in the context of a discussion concerning what he considered to be a justified sentencing disparity between rape cases of different severities.

He was countering the feminist assertion that ""all rape is rape and should be punished the same"".

He did so by comparing it to murder. He detailed two different murders.

1) A man spends 6 months planning the kidnapping of a politician's child. He kidnaps the child, and then demands a ransom from the politician. After he receives the ransom he kills the child and disposes of the corpse.

2) A man comes home to find his best friend in bed with his wife. In a rage, he grabs a heavy object and hits the friend over the head, killing him.

Helmer went on to say that while they are **both murder and deserve punishment and imprisonment**, most people would agree that the first is a much more serious, and evil crime. We factor in the fact that it was premeditated and had been thought about for 6 months, into the severity of our sentencing. The same can be true for the second crime, that while the man should still go to prison, he shouldn't be in there as long or be punished AS harshly as the murderer in the first scenario.

He then applied this same principle to the crime of rape, giving two scenarios.

1) A man waits down an alley in the early hours, sees a woman walking home from work, hits her over the head, drags her into the alley and rapes her.

2) A boyfriend and a girlfriend cuddle, kiss, and engage in foreplay in bed together. Just as the boyfriend is about to insert his penis into the girlfriend, she says ""no! stop!"", but he ignores her and does it anyway.

Now Helmer said, that while **both are deserving of punishment**, he considers the first to be a much more serious offence, deserving of greater punishment.

I think that many people would find that to be a perfectly reasonable position to hold. Helmer was simply using this example to counter the feminist argument that I detailed earlier. In my opinion it is a persuasive argument. 

But you don't care about nuance, you're completely fine with your ""he says rape victims are responsible!"" line, aren't you?

Y'know, I really don't get the 'all cops are bastards'/'pigs off planet!' type guff that a lot of my 'edgy' (read: white, middle-class, majority public-school educated) university friends come out with. Like, sure - you have problems with corrupt cops (me too.) You don't like criminal behaviour on the part of law enforcement. (Does anyone?) But then, you turn around - you, whose only major contact with police has been at an EDL/anti-fascist protest, who've never had to live in a high-crime area, never even interacted with cops on a daily basis like some of my (poorer, browner) friends have had to - and your immediate solution is condemn ALL cops? Every single one of them? The decent ones who recover phones after muggings, attend domestic violence incidents, who were parents of other kids at my working-class primary school, and who basically try to do the best they can each day to work in a customer-service job where 90% of the time the customer is a right royal twat? Really? All of them as well?

No, nobody likes the police. And some of the time, police do get it wrong. There are bad and aggressive and racist people who are in the profession for the wrong reasons. But this casual sweeping dismissal of all police while at the same time relying on your privileged status as a (relatively) rich, white university student to ensure that you need never come into contact with them? That's what really grinds my gears. 

What people should do if they have a problem with police brutality, of course, is to petition parliament and local police bodies to institute mandatory body-cams. Or protest against the widespread use of police tasers. Or to suspend stop-and-search powers. Or offer services as a teacher or subject for community sensitivity training. No-one should just sit there, posting details on facebook or reddit of random police brutality in Texas or another place you don't live, going 'fuck the police!', without at least some of this action to back that up.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"The zone system layout is fairly simple if you look at a tube map.

They are just bands around London defining how much you should be charged for a journey.

Zone 1 is the middle, and as you go further out the zone increases, up to zone 9, which is only used for really far out end points like Amersham, which is outside the M25!

The point of the zones is unified pricing. If you go to any station within the same zone as your starting point you pay the minimum fare of about £2 (I think.) The cost goes up proportionately the more zones you go through. 

An example: A trip from Chancery Lane to Paddington would be £2ish because they are both in zone 1 - it doesn't matter that you have to change lines to make the trip. However a journey from Finchley Central to King's Cross would cost significantly more as you have to go from zone 4 to zone 1.

Journeys passing across the city (Finchley to Wimbledon, say) will be charged a lot more because the system can identify that you have gone through zone 1 to get back to zone 3 where Wimbledon is.

However, if there is a route that does go through a second zone and a route that doesn't, the system automatically charges you for the cheapest option, even if you took the more expensive one. For instance, if you wanted to go from Clapham Junction to Highbury &amp; Islington on the overground, you could either go the long way round entirely in zone 2, or you could go the short way which takes you into zone 1.

Yes, you can evolve herbicide resistance without GM, but it's a lot quicker if those genes are out in the population anyway (though it'll only go to related plants)

You can use much more effective (and less discriminatory) herbicides with GM crops, since the crop has tailored resistance.  Without GM crops, you tend to have to use less deadly, or more specific herbicides, to avoid killing the crop as well as the weeds.  With GM, you can pretty much flood the place with it.

That leaves us with £1560, round it down to £1500 savings per month.

My 10% rise gives me £2200 (I'm pretty certain it's not difficult to get a job in London which gives you more than a 10% rise than what you currently have, so this is really a low estimate I'm giving)

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"&gt; Is there particular areas outside of London (or just on the edge of London, whichever) that is common for commuters and is affordable?

Again, you have the problem that ""common for commuters"" immediately means an area is highly desirable, so that pushes the prices right up again.

For instance I live in the Borough of Enfield, on the northern stretches of Greater London. In the west of Enfield are areas like Southgate and Oakwood which are on the Piccadilly Line, and consequently lots of people want to live close to the tube station for easy commuting. So people move in, the demand causes rents to rise, developers put up new ~~flats~~ luxury apartments, more people move in, rent goes up, etc etc.

In the east of Enfield (where I live) there is no tube, only some somewhat-iffy rail lines (yes Greater Anglia, I'm looking at you). This means that they're far less convenient for commuters, so rents aren't so high (combined with the area's industrial heritage, for some reason people don't want views of factories or power stations out their window).

In general of course everyone wants to live in the nicest area they can afford, but every horror story everyone's ever told you about the cost of living in London is true, so unless you're earning *very* good money you generally have to compromise somewhere.

TLDR: affordable rent / nice area / easy commute: pick any two, unless you're very well-paid.",0,1399649207,null,0,false,0,chdontv,t3_25493e,t1_chdontv,t1_chdnvr3,null,1433722301,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

Explicit racism is the easiest way to tell if someone is racist, and there are psychological tests that exist to examine implicit racism. 

In the case of Nigel Farage, he is not explicitly racist (if he has racist views he is not forthcoming with them). However, policy decisions and political opinions can be viewed as implicitly racist if they are not based in logic/science and appear to result from in-group/out-group thinking. 

For example, if a policy was to close all of UK's borders on the grounds that immigration is too high (in-group = residents out-group = potential immigrants), without a basis in statistical analysis that could clearly show a causal link between immigration and negative effects to the country and its residents then the policy could be viewed as racist.

Not true.  

They've appointed loads of spokespeople and have been announcing snippets of NEC approved policy.

&gt;Do you know their stance on the NHS? 

Here's the UKIP health spokesperson Dr Steph McWilliam.  She worked in the NHS as a radiologist for 20 years.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aei1KchYvac    

Here's her colleague Professor Angus Dagleish who sits on the UKIP health policy board with her, whose career was oncology in the NHS:   

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5m1jJ6gmo2Y

You can do the same with other policies.  Google the spokesperson, for example communities is Suzanne Evans, housing is Andrew Charlambous, disabilities is Star Etheridge, Economics has just seen Steve Woolfe taken over Professor Tim Congdon...and you can get a good idea from running their names through YouTube to hear them speak.

&gt; Have you seen a SINGLE UKIP member acquit themselves well in a public forum? 

Since they're the only party doing public meetings up and down the country as a campaign strategy, and prominent MEP candidates are attending these and speaking then the answer is a clear yes.

Again, YouTube a couple names from their upcoming stable:  Amjad Bashir, Jane Collins, Jill Seymour, Margot Parker, Julia Reid, Michael Heaver, Janice Atkinson, Tim Aker, Patrick O'Flynn, Gawain Towler, Louise Bours, David Coburn, Diane James, Shneur Odze, Steve Woolfe.

You can find videos of these people making speeches in public.

&gt;The string of racist and small minded shit coming from their twitters and interviews is appalling.

Yet they're the only party that's pulling off public meetings which are now starting to pull in some really large local numbers.  Like all parties they have a problem with a small element and they're being put under greater scrutiny by the other 3 and the media, but they're dealing with it as it arises - far more so than the other parties.

&gt;I don't think I've heard him say anything racist. 

You don't think it.  You know it. He hasn't.

&gt;But his agenda is fundamentally discriminatory. He's also a hypocrite, he employs a non British national, despite saying that he's against giving jobs to foreigners.

Wait, your problem is that he's a hypocrite because he doesn't discriminate enough?!

He's not against giving jobs to foreigners.  He's for controlled immigration.  

&gt;I can't blame anyone for being disillusioned. I work for the NHS and I'm very morose about the future.

Hey, they're the only party that will stop the NHS from being privatised, which is what the liberalised agenda in the EU is really about.  They'd return it to clinician management, so run by NHS professionals who love the NHS, and peg the NHS budget as a percentage to GDP, then put county elected health boards in charge so if privatisation raises its head again then its the local people who decide the nature of the local service.

I very carefully avoided saying that BR ran a better service than we have today. What they did was run a working rail service for *very little money*. They were highly efficient. You even acknowledge this fact in your own ""rebuttal"":

&gt; Since privatization the government subsidies have tripled it is true, BUT they're serving double the number of passengers

Using your own figures, we should conclude that BR was 50% more efficient than today's rail service.

My point was *not* that nationalised industries are always best, but that the picture is mixed. Some nationalised industries are relatively successful (NHS, BR), while others were a disaster (BL).

You can have the best model in the world and it won't do you any good if you don't have the right values to plug into it.

That information is obscured. It's contained within the accounts of a hundred different private institutions. Probably only regulators like the Fed/SEC have the ability to access all the data you'd need to predict the crash, and it didn't occur to them to look closely enough. No one realised how interconnected the banks were, and how exposed they were to sub-prime real estate via reinsurers like AIG.

So while economics possesses the theoretical tools to explain the crash, the right people didn't have the all actual data to predict it.

Before that we had experimented with 3 at the back which didn;t really suit us and led to us dropping points in away games to the likes of Newcastle and Arsenal.

As long as we keep hold of Suarez which I think we will, add a couple of attacking players (Lallana, Konoplyanka?) for depth and improve the defence we should be stronger.

true,[deleted],null,null,"No you're right that was an exaggeration.   But Marxism appeals to emotion and contains very little factual evidence to back it up.  As an analysis of certain aspects of capitalism (ie some people profit off of others' labour etc) it is valid, but as an impetus for revolution it is flawed as it relies entirely on emotion (ie that the proletariat are exploited, that the situation needs to change, that the alternative is better).

Often people get so caught up in looking at the 'Marxist criticism' of a certain thing that they fail to accept or discuss the fact that Marx wasn't just a critic, he also proposed a solution.  And that solution rests upon huge leaps of judgement about human nature, the future of society, the nature of man, and the success of political and social revolution on a global scale.   To me, discussing economic issues from a Marxist perspective would necessitate discussing Marx's solution (as spelled out in the Manifesto etc..), and there is no scientific or logical basis upon which that can be defended.    Marxism bases itself on what you believe is right (that workers should control industry) , not on empirical economic facts like GDP or quality of life, both of which have always been superior in Capitalist countries anyway.  

And yes, I read History and Political Science at University, with a special focus on Economic History, so while I am not an expert on modern economics (though I work in banking so have a basic idea), I am familiar enough with Marxist theory.

Whilst no parties have GE manifestos, they are usually largely similar to the previous election - the Tories might change some numbers here and some numbers there, possibly pledge to an in-out Europe referendum , but otherwise it'll still be the same Tories. 

UKIP are still a young party, rapidly growing, and have completely disowned their previous manifesto that was only 4 years old. Plus, that manifesto only contained some rather questionable social policies, with no real numerical justification or explanations, anyways. It isn't necessarily an inherent problem for UKIP, but at the moment they definitely lack a real identity. It *could* be a good thing, after the election if they do well they then actually consult with their voters as to what they actually want, but I doubt they will.

Whilst I wouldn't vote UKIP myself, I'm pro-democracy and all that jazz, and if vote UKIP then great for you. I do think that those people who vote UKIP thinking they are different from the other parties, that they fairly represent the data on Europe (and other topics), and think their members have integrity and the 'balls' to actually change things will be sorely disappointed, however.

Luiz, at least to me, shows the ability to be a world-class player with positioning and awareness and ability. I totally admit he make positioning mistakes too often, though. I think he looks even better when in with Matic, which enables him to press further (and being the holding mid as opposed to the defensive of the pair can also further limit any lapses he has). He's also the best and most positive personality we have on the pitch.

My point is there are other than economic benefits to be benefited from energy security - mainly itself, as well as some moral reasoning behind. 

Taken from course materials (OU):

&gt; For example, in 2006, a report for the UK Treasury by Sir (now Lord) Nicholas Stern argued that climate change can be dealt with by the countries of the world investing 1% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) every year. Deferring action to the future would mean that the costs would rise to about 5% of GDP, possibly increasing to 20% of GDP or more (HM Treasury, 2006).

&gt; Stern concluded, therefore, that it was cheaper to deal with the costs of climate change today rather than postpone action to the future. The longer action is delayed, he argued, the more expensive it will be.

I'd also argue that investment in science such as renewables etc may place us in a better position to act if there is a disaster in the next X years, and that we would have increased resilience because of it.

It also brings up a possible issue of religious discrimination in the meat processing industry, as only Muslims can carry out the slaughter. 

Another issue which I think is what most people are concerned about, is the right to know that the meat you are buying is Halal. You should be able to know what you are buying and eating, regardless on your views on Halal.

Thing is - it's not just the UK that is affected by climate change. So if shit does hit the fan, it will have global impacts which feedback into the UK. Food prices, labour costs, food availability etc will all be affected and so by not acting here and now, our over all quality of life will be reduced further down the line because of it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Grammar Schools are an romantic ideal

I don't think they're saying ""let's have the exact grammar school system we had in the 60s"". I think they want to bring back the principle of selective education so that poor kids get a chance to get a decent education as opposed to the current system now where all the rich kids go off to private schools while the working class get sent to shit-tier comps.

Grammar schools done in a modern way could be a great benefit to our education system.

&gt;This is so idiotic as to not merit a response. Shale gas exploration is one of the PR masterstrokes of the last five years. This is the time to commit to renewable energy.

Wind farms are an extremely expensive and inefficient form of energy, I'd prefer to see more money put into solar power if I'm honest. Nuclear power, if done sensibly, can be extremely beneficial. Fracking, whether you believe the estimates, WOULD result in a reduction in the energy bills of working people and we would certainly have enough energy to run the country for some time. 

Contrast that with the left's position which seems to be ""fracking is evil and anyone within a 10 mile radius will die of lead poisoning"", and ask yourself who is really being unrealistic.

&gt;Every single party is committed to a referendum on the EU, it's just their timescales that differ.

This is demonstrably untrue. Miliband has said on the record that he does not support a referendum, and I believe Clegg has said the same. The Greens and UKIP support one, and the tories claim to, which in my eyes isn't a trustworthy promise at all.

&gt;This is bluster and an impossible claim to make. WANTING to secure a trade agreement would be more appropriate. Because I want your TV doesn't mean you'll give it to me.

We are the EU's biggest export market. I find it highly unlikely that they wouldn't want a free trade agreement with us. They would be the ones paying the majority of import tariffs. Switzerland has a free trade agreement with the EU. Do you really think they would deny one to us, their biggest export market?

Get real.

&gt;They do jobs other people aren't prepared to and they do them well.

This is nonsense. What, were there no British cleaners before we introduced mass immigration? Were there no British fruit pickers?

The truth of the matter is that due to wage compression, immigrants often do the jobs because a British person cannot AFFORD to do the same jobs. A group of Polish guys who come over and share a house between 6 of them, can afford to live on a much lower rate than a native Brit who has a child and a mortgage. 

We've seen wage compression of 14% since the early 2000s. Not to mention the cultural affects of mass immigration. We have had Lutfur Rahman, a man with links to Islamist terrorist organistions elected into a position of British governance by a majority immigrant voting block in Tower Hamlets. Expect to see more of this.

Although, I doubt you'd know much about that, living in your affluent middle class suburb.

We also have to take into account the fact that in London, the NHS is going through an era of desperation, even senior figures agree as much. We have seen waiting times go up and up over the years. Immigration, though not the sole cause of this, doesn't help.

We have a shortage in social housing, which has resulted in members of parliament proposing that we actually concrete over parts of the green belt in order to build more houses. Again, immigration isn't the sole cause of this, but it certainly doesn't help.

And then we have senior figures in education saying that we need to somehow magically create 250,000 new primary school places. This is a direct result of mass immigration. On top of all of this, if the situation in the Mediterranean gets worse, we will see more and more migration. I don't blame those who choose to come here, but our public resources and infrastructure just can't handle it.

The UK is a finite island with finite space, with an extremely high population density. Why you would support mass immigration is beyond me. UKIP's points based immigration system is just common sense. Think 40/50 years ahead. Is our current rate of immigration sustainable? Really?

&gt; I don't know one person who has lost out on a job to someone from overseas.

That's because you don't know anyone working class.

&gt;Having an economics education that involves 5 distinct approaches talking past each other, doesn't improve the subject at all. 

It sounds like you don't understand science. 

For example, in Physics theoretical physicists have created a whole load of theories as to how the underlying matter of the universe actually works, many of which contradict eachother. They use these theories to propose experiments and as new experimental data becomes available, old inccompatible theories are abandoned and new explanations are developed. There is never, at any point, only one physics.

So why do you insist that, in order to become more like a science, economics only needs to adopt only one theory (approach)?

Also, in Physics, if a theory fails to adequately explain data, it is either modified, or disposed of.

&gt;""If I need any information, I am better off asking the players,"" Sherwood said

He paints it as if the players greet him like the boyfriend of their divorced mother.  As if he walks into the room and they say ""We don't need to listen to you, you aren't even our real manager. You are being replaced in the summer anyways"".

But look at his quote....""I have had a lot of players come to me and say to me: 'Our agents have told us you are not going to be here next year"".....this shouldn't be a negative thing and it shouldn't be a public thing.....this is how a squad should work.  The player(s) are hearing a rumor from the media, from agents, from fans, from teammates and they are going to the manager to ask what the hell is going on.

The players should be going to Sherwood privately and asking what the situation is, its Sherwood's job to address the question and keep them focused on task.

He is painting a picture that he is persecuted, and that somehow he has been wronged by using something that happened behind closed doors. 

He is the one painting the picture of a calamitous locker room. He is the one continually stating players aren't working hard, stating that they ""capitulate"" that they don't play hard, that they are treating him like a ""supply teacher"".

If Sherwood kept his mouth shut we would have no view of what was happening inside the club....instead Sherwood is the one who brings up the issues, but he brings them up in a manner that is self-serving.

Tim presents all these issues as ""look at this clusterfuck i have had to deal with and we are still doing alright""....how about, as manager, you work to fix the clusterfuck? He doesn't seem to do it because it doesn't paint the right portrait that he wants to portray to the media....he wants to be able to blame any issue that happened on the club or the players while absolving himself of any fault.

It would be great to know what happens behind closed doors and have the full picture....unfortunately the club won't offer that and Tim will never offer it because it doesn't fit his agenda.

I'm saying not that science does not have a plurality of theories, I did not say that..

It's not something physics is proud of it, is an embarrassment, and the absence of a working proposal for a experiential system to decide between them makes some people even take a Machian (as in Ernest Mach)standpoint of looking on with disdain at the entire project due to its inability to do this. 

Point being, science in aiming for completeness, does want to reduce all theories eventually to in effect. Plurality is a consequence of limited experimental data as you note. The approach, fundamentally then is to improve the fields experimental methods.  

My objection to this proposal, was simple. It's not trying to refine the econmetrics and expereimental systems (which due to increasing computational power we theoretically can do). It's an plea for plurality, for pluralities sake.

If you finished your degree a few years ago, you're actually on the 1998-2011 system which currently repays above [£16910](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/students/student-loans-repay#post), not £21k. If this is the case, then your interest rate is practically guaranteed to be the lowest you'll ever see for loans and will often be below savings rates and definitely than inflation, currently this is 1.5%, cheaper than a 4.3% loan and even 6% savings before 2.5% inflation. In this situation, even if you suddenly get a huge pay rise and manage to pay off the entire loan before it would have otherwise been written off (25 years after graduation), you'll still have benefitted from keeping the potential overpayments in savings. This is why I liked the system, because it was as close to a graduate tax as you can get while being very fair.

On the 2012+ starters scheme, it's less clear cut and basically hinges on whether you think you'll pay off (at 9% above £21k) the full loan before it's written off 30 years after graduation. If you won't pay it off fully, there's no point making early repayments as the write off absorbs the cost of even the current 6.3%. If you will definitely pay it off, then it might be worth making early repayments only if it's your highest interest earning debt and will likely be for a while to come (e.g. if you're not planning on buying a house or car).",0,1399654603,null,0,false,0,chdr9t4,t3_254zs7,t1_chdr9t4,t3_254zs7,null,1433723531,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

It's not like we're busting at the seams in midfield to begin with and we've always been just one or two injuries away from being left with little to no option up front.  Imagine if Suarez had picked up even a little niggle and missed a game or two while Sturridge was out.  We really only have 6 midfielders (Ger/Lucas, Hendo/Allen, Cout/Stirling) and 2 forwards that are genuine first team players and they are responsible for occupying 6 places on the pitch between just the 8 of them.

true,UncleArthur,null,null,"Questions that need to be asked would include:

- What are your goals for the money? I am assuming growth, for a house deposit in 10 years.

- What level of risk are you willing to take? This will vary greatly, normally dependent upon the investment timescales. For example, if you want access to the money within 5 years, I would suggest a no-risk investment strategy. If you don't want to see it until you retire, then an equity-based investment could be better. For a ten year investment, a unit trust that holds a mixture of 70% bonds / 30% equities might suit, but you must appreciate that the investment will carry charges and can fall in value.

- What are your views on ethical investment? If you wish to invest ethically, look for mutual funds that match your views. I would not put the money in insurance company funds that invest significantly in bonds, as these generate income yields and the insurance company has to deduct Income Tax at 20% at source (you appear to be a non-taxpayer). Mutual funds will still deduct this tax on their funds at source, but unlike insurance company funds, you can claim the tax back at the end of each Tax Year by completing a simple HMRC form called an R40.

- If you are uncomfortable with investment risk, then from July this year, you will be able to invest £15,000 in a Cash ISA, which will give you zero risk, (normally) easy access and tax-free interest. In any event, you should try and maintain an emergency fund that could support you for 3-6 months if your income ceased. Based on your figures (assuming tax free) that would work out at between £4,200 and £8,400.

- Another no-risk investment that is worth looking at is National Savings (Google NS&amp;I). Most of the tax-free investments available require you to invest for a fixed term of 3-5 years. The Index-Linked Certificates are worth considering.

- Finally, you could also invest up to £2,880 in a pension fund; no more, as it appears you are not earning an income that is pensionable. Tax relief on this would increase the investment to £3,600 immediately, but you would not be able to access the money until age 55. This is very tax efficient, and would use up only a small part of your capital.

Once you've picked a few funds (spread the money around), you can use a fund supermarket to make and manage your investment, such as Fidelity FundsNetwork (https://www.fidelity.co.uk/investor/funds/fund-supermarket.page) There are a few out there. Sadly, an IFA will probably charge you a fee for advice that is a very large percentage of what you are looking to invest; otherwise I'd suggest getting professional advice there.

Regarding your pension, Scottish Widows funds are not normally good performers and you may want to research its performance and, if necessary, switch to another fund of your choice. Apart from that, you can't touch the pension until you reach 55, so there's nothing else you can do, apart from fund switching / transferring to a new provider.

Hope this helps - just some random thoughts!
