There's no guarantee the electorate has any idea what they're voting on. Things are right or wrong irrespective of whether or not a majority of people think it's right or wrong. We can't vote that 2 + 2 = 5 and that it magically become so. Additionally, most people don't have the time to be well educated about every issue facing the country. The government makes thousands of decisions daily and we can't keep up with them all. Additionally, a lot of things 

It's for these two reason that have representative democracy (electing representatives to make decisions our behalf) rather than direct democracy (making the public vote on every single decision). 

In this country the general principle is that we elect the politician our politicians based on their ideology (e.g. socialist, marxist, conservative, neo/classical liberal, positive-liberal, fascist) rather than specific policies which are put in a party or candidate's manifesto (e.g. tuition fees, Europe, trident, tax). The exact implementation should not be considered too closely because these policy decisions may need to adapt to changing circumstances.

There's all sorts of (sound) reasons why we don't vote on ideology much, but we should at least keep it in mind slightly more than we currently do, when we vote. ",0,1394667792,null,0,false,0,cg15ozd,t3_20878m,t1_cg15ozd,t1_cg12n38,null,1432775294,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Also many politicians seems to ideologically believe in the EU at all costs. 

If you take him for his word when Farage met Merkel during the Greek crisis he asked her why she didn't just let the country leave, she replied ""we cannot let Greece go, because if it does leave, there will be other countries that will want to leave too, and that will mean the end of the European project.""

That tells you all you need to know. They don't care how much damage being in the EU does to countries, they are hell bent on forming a federal superstate regardless of any democratic mandate.

&gt;It's partly interesting because the point of view 'Ed' in the article is putting forward is a genuine and perhaps strongest criticism of democracy. There's no guarantee the electorate has any idea what they're voting on. 

So why did they not have a problem people voting on being in the EU and having the Euro? *Now* we can't make the right decision between us when we might decide to leave but you go right a head and vote to have the Euro citizens. It turns out that our constant opposition from giving up the pound has left us better off than being in the single currency mess so it's incredible when people and politicians claim we can't be trusted.

true,superlewis,flair5,,"First of all, if Benfica knock us off. The fact that you said when just demonstrates my point. Sherwood is not above criticism and I'm not saying he is, but it seems this sub has already fired Tim before the season is over. Supporting the club includes supporting the manager. I dare say there are people here pulling for us to lose to Benfica (sounds like you're one of them) to ensure Sherwood gets fired. 

When the fans have decided that Sherwood is out, the media has decided Sherwood is out, and Levy has done nothing to dispel the rumor that Sherwood is out we should expect him to lose the locker room. It motivates players to know they are playing for their place. Why would anyone be motivated to play when the team, media and fans seem to have decided this season is a throw away months before it's over. My worst exams in school were those where I knew a C was out of arch below and an A was out of reach above. We've decided that's the case for Spurs and now the players are playing like it's the case. 

It's not the case! Fifth is the most likely result for this season, but we are by no means eliminated from contention for fourth. The Sherwood out folks seem to have forgotten that. Besides, calling fifth a failed season for this club is absurd. We lost three of the best players in club history in the last two seasons. We're finishing fifth after that in the most competitive league in the world and you're calling the season a write off? That is a lack of support for the team. I'm ashamed of fans who think that way.

As for using SHA-2, it's simple counter intelligence to continue using a compromised system with less sensitive information to avoid raising suspicion. Also, note that assuming that it does 1000 operations per second increasing your key length to 4096 (which is the current ""safe"" by conventional means length) you get almost a year of uncompromised communication, at 10,000 a month etc. So perhaps they simply aren't fast enough to be an issue assuming they just change their key's on a somewhat regular basis.

Meaning a 128 bit AES key would be made as secure as a 64 bit key.

128 bits is concidered to be pretty damn secure (but 64 bits isn't), the prospect of quantum computers has lead to most software (such as TrueCrypt) offering a 256 bit key option (sqrt 2^256  = 2^128 ).

Basically if you're worried. Use a 256 bit key.

&gt;Tasman named a few geographic features as he sailed along New Zealand's west coast. Many such as [Murderers Bay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Bay) did not last, while some like [Cape Maria van Diemen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Maria_van_Diemen) (the wife of the governor of [Batavia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta)) and [Three Kings Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Kings_Islands) are still in use. Cook named many more on his voyage, including [Bay of Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Islands), [Bay of Plenty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Plenty), [Poverty Bay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_Bay), [Cape Farewell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Farewell,_New_Zealand), [Queen Charlotte Sound](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Charlotte_Sound,_New_Zealand), [Mount Egmont](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Egmont) and [Banks Peninsula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banks_Peninsula). [Cape Kidnappers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Kidnappers) commemorates a Māori attempt to kidnap one of Cook's crew members. [Dumont d’Urville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumont_d%E2%80%99Urville) named [French Pass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Pass) after sailing through it. The explorers lent their names to many places, including [Mount Tasman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Tasman), [Tasman Glacier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasman_Glacier), the [Tasman Region](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasman_Region), [Cook Strait](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Strait), [Mount Cook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Cook) and [D'Urville Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Urville_Island,_New_Zealand). The [*Coromandel*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Malabar_(1804\)), [*Chatham*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Chatham_(1788\)) and *Pegasus* ships visited New Zealand's shores between 1791 and 1820 and were used to name [Coromandel Peninsula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coromandel_Peninsula), [Chatham Islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Islands), [Pegasus Bay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_Bay) and [Port Pegasus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Pegasus). [Stewart Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Island) was named after the first officer aboard the *Pegasus*.

true,The-Darkest-Knight,num19,,"Since I posted a lot about Holtby in the last few days, here's what I said:
******************************
&gt; Holtby isn't 20% of what he's made out to be on this sub. He's hailed as some sort of creative genius which he's not. He's not half the player Coutinho is, since you brought him up, and the only reason this sub likes him so much is because he has the right attitude and a good personality. He's a likable fellow, and probably a positive influence on the squad - but on the pitch he's very average. He's a workhorse, he's run around and he'll put in a tackle and every now and then he'll find a good pass, but he isn't close to what Eriksen is nor is he close to being ""the player we need"" as of now.
3 years later, who knows?
He set up Sidwell (I think) for a good goal against United, he scored a cracker against Fulham, and he had a really nice pass through to Defoe in the Europa league which Defoe slammed home, and Holtby set up Lamela for a nice pass to Paulinho which got us the winner against Cardiff.
Those are his highlights for all the time he's spent at Spurs. I can list them out on one hand. There was too much of a craze around him being signed for a ridiculously low fee, but the matter of the fact is that he needs 2-3 years of development in the English league before he can come good for us.
Mind you - I think he most definitely can, he has the potential.
But as of now, him coming back to the squad would give us nothing additional. It's hilarious if you think about it. Each time Holtby did play for us, 90% of the fans here always said, ""I love Holtby but he has to do more than run around and ""TRY"" hard."" - and now all of a sudden he's the most missed player?
It's frustrating. It's like some people here have the memory of a sieve and I wish they'd fucking see black from white.
******************************
&gt; Holtby is massively over-rated by /r/coys, and he needs to spend at least a year or two out on loan to an English club before being considered for a starting spot. He has ""passion"" and is ""hard working"" but that doesn't help with shit in terms of goals, assists and points.
******************************
&gt; I'll break it down:
Holtby's energy is great. I like it. He runs around and presses a lot. That's great and everything, he's just the guy to bring on at the 65-70th minute mark when we're up by 2 or 3 goals and are looking to contain sides. But his energy, 75% of the time does not transform to adding to build-up play going forward.
With Lennon and Townsend in the squad, we don't have to worry about playing slow. Holtby isn't exactly electrifying - he won't solve the pace problem. In fact, he was most at fault at times for a lot of the lack in pace because he did pass sideways a lot in the final third.
Quick movement and passing for us = Soldado, Lennon, Townsend, Dembele, Eriksen.
Holtby was the WORST to break down defences. Don't you remember when he was being played and Eriksen wasn't getting regular games? We were cribbing about penetration and ERIKSEN ERIKSEN ERIKSEN was being chanted all the time.",1,1394693520,null,0,false,0,cg1fw5i,t3_20alt0,t1_cg1fw5i,t3_20alt0,null,1432780234,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

Have you ever thought about opening another current account? (Which many people do, some actually have multiple current accounts)  
Nationwide's FlexDirect current account offers a 5pc interest (pre-tax) on any balance in the account up to £2500, for 12 months.  
The only catch is you need to put in min of £1000 per month to get this pc rate. However, you are completely allowed to withdraw whatever you want from the account each month also so take my example:  
  
1. Open a FlexDirect account with nationwide and put £3500 into it, £2500 of which you will never touch for 12 months  
  
2. Transfer £1000 FROM FlexDirect to your other account, (so you now have £2500 in your FlexDirect account). 
  
3. Then every month, you put a min of £1000 into FlexDirect then transfer it out again (there isn't really any benefit to having more than £2500 sitting in it).   
  
4. Therefore doing this for 12 months, you could earn interest at a rate of 4% after-tax (assuming you're a basic rate tax payer) on £2500 which earns £100 interest.  
  
5. So if you look at it, you can earn the same interest from utilising £3500 efficiently as you can with maxing out your cash ISA at £5760.   

Don't forget you then have saved £2260 of money you didn't need to lock away  for a year which can then go in another savings account and earn more interest!

But the point is, that the biggest rise in *money in pocket* for those earning minimum wage will have been in raising the personal tax threshold, and changing employees NI contributions.

I honestly, can not understand why someone working 15 hours on minimum wage a week pays any tax, let alone NI contributions.  But you can see how Brown used this as a way of raising money:

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"Some good thoughts and reasoning here, although I don't quite agree with all of it.  I did argue long and hard for Holtby being loaned out previously, as I've always thought he was not top 4 challenging material.  However, it now appears that neither is the rest of our squad.

The reason I've changed my tune somewhat is because he might not be as polished as say Dembele or Eriksen, but he does offer something different to anyone else in our team.  Holtby's energy is one asset, but to me his most important attribute is his willingness to play penetrative passes.

It's no secret we've struggled massively with penetration from the midfield to the forward line, and only Eriksen seems genuinely capable of making that happen on a regular basis.  But if he's out, we're screwed.  Or perhaps even more pertinently, if he gets starved of possession, we still get screwed.

Dembele, Paulinho, Sandro, Capoue and Bentaleb do not offer much vertical penetration.  Dembele holds onto the ball too long, and the others are much more likely to pass sideways or backwards than forwards.  Holtby, even when he loses it, is at least looking to pass through teams rather than bore them to tears.

A loan spell can still be good for him, because he'll undoubtedly get more game time at Fulham than he would've here.  But there's been plenty of games lately than we've been suffocated in, and I've looked at the bench and not seen anyone on it that can at least try something different for us.

true,notnotcitricsquid,null,null,"I think that it's Denton, and this is entirely based off of two points early on. First: The missing girl. Denton *randomly* selected a missing girl and then *randomly* stumbles upon a garage by searching ""local garage"" on the internet that conveniently had the body buried underneath? Yeah the garage began with A but it could have been chosen for that reason. Either the show is throwing out red herrings to fuck with the audience (which I don't doubt) or it's evidence that she was involved in some way and was creating a neat trail to tie it all together. Second: I forget what exactly it was but after she was arrested and taken into custody she talked with the female police officer and Denton repeatedly glossed over very important details that would have had a significant impact on directing the investigation in a more productive direction, but she chose to stay quiet and the only information she really mentioned was Dryden: she didn't give the police evidence, she gave them a story. 

Denton is obsessive, has motive, has shown that she is very good at finding information and manipulation (for example the financial records, Steve kissing the nurse etc.) so it's entirely plausible that she tracked Dryden -&gt; discovered he was having sex with underage girls -&gt; understood how she could use this to her advantage. ""People have underestimated me all of my life"". She happily killed that corrupt police officer, she went far beyond ""protecting herself"". I don't think it's beyond plausible that she arranged for herself to be kidnapped and instructed them to keep her alive... I'm sure I've seen a film with a similar plot before. The hand burning thing is just... I dunno, I think it's very possible she arranged it to happen to herself, it's not a long term injury but it *is* something that has a big impact and portrays her as a victim of a conspiracy. Why the hell would Dryden arrange for her hands to be burned? To stop her saying what? That he had an affair with her?

Let's say it was Dryden: Why was Denton left alive when the witness was killed? If Dryden had wanted to set her up and was willing to kill numerous people why on earth didn't he just kill her while he was at it? The police could have quite easily said ""oh well the killers must have made a mistake and accidentally killed her by getting the vehicle wrong"". Throw some money into her bank account and the jobs done! Leaving her alive just doesn't fit, unless he ""loves"" her? If he loves her he wouldn't let her near a life term as an ex-police officer in prison... if he had the balls to kill a witness and a bunch of officers, he would have the balls to kill Denton whatever it took.

The corrupt police officers (the one that died and the one that was almost killed and now wants immunity) were apparently known to be corrupt, what's to say they weren't both working for 2 different people? They worked with Dryden for some unknown criminal thing (maybe they were smuggling drugs?) and the dead girls presence at the reception was unrelated to them, why on earth would Dryden involve 2 low ranking officers in his underage sex-murder fantasy (edit: actually supposedly the asian guy was her boyfriend, forgot about that, not sure how to make that fit in: Denton found out about the Dryden sex stuff, worked it into her plan?)? Denton knew they were corrupt ('cause everyone did!) and could have hired them to be involved in her ""plot"" -- but she hired them anonymously so they didn't *know* it was her.

I just can't make Dryden fit... but then I know that ultimately this entire plot rests on one ""key"" piece of information that we don't have: why was the witness moved? They're going to reveal that at some point and it will be what ties everything together, and I won't be surprised if it's Denton, Dryden or someone else. The show has intentionally cast multiple other characters as ""shady"", for example the officer that came from another department (tall guy, said he quit smoking in this episode) asked to be given total responsibility over some task... with shifty eyes.

Dryden cheated on his wife numerous times, had sex with underage girls, he couldn't give a fuck about any one individual, he can't have given a big enough fuck about Denton to try and set her up to take the fall for murdering a witness: after all, once she's in prison what's to say she won't decide to get back at him and tell his wife about the affair? There's more than circumstantial evidence...

I guess that the point of the show is that they're ultimately all corrupt in their own way and it's rotten to the core, but the way that some of them behave boggles my mind. They literally do not communicate, it's like everyone of the characters is living out their own hero fantasy and is sabotaging the process as they go. I really like the show but I find myself shouting at the characters for being complete and utter morons, although I think that perhaps that's something the writers intended, they intended the show to be full of misdirection to show how difficult an investigation like this is, maybe?

To be honest it's not really our job to know, that's something the owners need to work out.

Uwe Rosler would've been my pick a few months back, but that ship has sailed and I'm not sure there are any similar chiefs in League One.

Whoever comes in (or Redknapp if he stays) will have a small bit of elbow room in the Summer window and will have to be wide awake, pumped with caffeine and know what the fuck he is doing to bring in a select few players to complement this squad. Finding someone right for that will be a real challenge, because right now the only guys familiar with a lot of the names on this list are Steve Gallen and his people.

The good news is that the second parachute payment should go some way in covering a wage figure of this amount, and even with a view of filing subsequent accounts within the loss threshold of £8m we could even splash a small bit of cash. I calculated elsewhere that under normal circumstances in the Championship we break even at £20m expenditure. Add the £8m acceptable losses and £15m parachute payment and the magic figure is £43m.

If we do somehow get promoted, then Christ knows.

&gt;How is it my fault that all these bank charge you for things other banks would not even dream of touching: such as online payments to a merchant that is not UK based.

really? I never get charged,even if the online transaction is in another CURRENCY


But to answer your questions

1) Use my debit card however I damn want, without security features that actually block everything and without limits? I work with large amounts of money every day, I don't need my bank to babysit me. I need my money when I need them, not when they agree, for the 5th time, that it is indeed me who is using it.

*There is a difference between HUGE volumes in a COMMERCIAL TRANSACTION and a PERSONAL TRANSACTION, the personal one will be recorded as per the Fraud and Money Laundering regulations, hence the restrictions on large volume transactions.*


2) Has free SEPA transfers, and you can use your debit and credit card wherever you want, without a) foreign transaction fee of 2.70% - b) foreign purchase flat fee of 1.50

*Nope as SEPA is a EURO initiative only, and as for fees, look around there are banks that do not charge fees, hard to find but they are there, but as a general rule of thumb, you will always be charged fora  Currency Transaction*

3) Has a mobile app that is native, fast, allows you to do payments to whoever you want, regardless if it is already added or not, and will not stop working if you have an Android that is rooted.

*Never used a Rooted phone so gonna have to figure this one out yourself....*

4) Allows you to contact them 24/7, free of charge, over the phone.

*use Say no to 0870 for free numbers*

Personally we Brits do not care about stuff above, this is the tradeoff we accept in order to have FREE BANKING, when most EU countries charge for bank accounts.

After providing all that information (because I did sell quite often on ebay), i waited another month, just to get another email asking for the same information. Called up and they said they wanted more proof, even though they had everything I could possibly give them.

Researchers had to do lectures at the uni I went to. Had one that barely spoke English, but fortunately the stuff they were teaching I already knew (was basically stats 1 + 2 from A-level). 

Had two lecturers who didn't like questions in the middle of their lectures. Surprise, surprise they were both a total waste of time, and just read their slides. One basically plagiarised a book, the other one I wasn't sure of his sources, but you might as well have read Wikipedia. 

If all your lecturers are kinda crummy, it does sound like you're at a shit uni. It is important to look at the rankings for your particular course, as unis do vary in what they ""specialise"" in. 

Before I chose what unis I would apply for, I did the open days - computer science (what I did) varies massively in course quality. One uni I visited their CS degree was pretty much only webdev, which is not a good way to go. I do have a career in webdev now, but really, webdev is a specialisation, so it's best to go for the more generalist stuff, then specialise later. If you're doing CS, webdev stuff should really only be a module or two. 

If I were in your position, I'd be looking to go to another uni. You're right, that's not how it's supposed to be. I'm sure most unis have a couple of bum lecturers, but it sounds like you're dealing with a high rate of them.

Dunk half, leave for 5-6 seconds (times vary depending on the temperature of the tea, longer for cooler tea).    Eat when soft, not soggy, or you risk loosing the whole lot to the bottom of the mug.

Ginger nuts are good, you can dunk the whole thing at once, very vulnerable to over saturation.

Rich teas, while dunking well taste too bland.

Chocolate coated Digestives are also good, the chocolate layer provides a barrier to the tea coming in.

Never dunk a piece of shortbread.  That leads to a bad time, must be the butter in them melting.

One of the most durable biscuits is the Mcvities Caramel Biscuit, the internal caramel layer provides excellent structural integrity that holds up to prolonged dunking.

He's also shown an ability to receive and layoff passes in and around the area as well, he's done quite well fielded by himself, to the point of often making Soldado look redundant.

And I meant that if Spurs played 4-4-2 they would be faced with a 3v2 when they are out of possession, not when they have the ball. Benfica will actually probably a numerical advantage in the middle either way when they have the ball. If Spurs play two up top, one of their defensive mids will drop in between their centerbacks and create a 3v2 to move it out from the back and then get forward to help maintain the 3v2 in midfield as well. 

If Spurs play 4-1-4-1 one of their centerbacks would be able to move beyond Adebayor with the ball and create a 4v3 in the middle. I'd rather see that happening as allowing one of their centerbacks forward would create a hole in their defense to counter into if they lost possession.

And I don't follow the overlapping runs from midfielders, that's generally only a term for fullbacks making runs beyond their sided wide mid, wide mids won't have anyone to overlap playing in a 4-4-2, I get what you're saying though Spurs midfield does struggle to time forward runs well.

&gt;Why was he loaned and why didn't he fit our team? Do you think in hindsight that he should've stayed? I just really don't get it.


He plays very close to the Eriksen role as a CAM, and Eriksen frankly deserves that spot. But I could see them playing together, so it would also be a combination of that plus the amount of new players we brought in this summer. There are only so many spots on the pitch, Eriksen deserves his spot, and at the time he was losing out to new additions who we just spent a lot of money on.

In hindsight, maybe?  If he stayed, I'd rather have seen him than Bentaleb, but he wouldn't be getting as many games as he is right now. He's having to grind out games and performances with Fulham, so this should be a real opportunity for him to grow.

&gt;But I get the impression that everyone on here thinks thats the only thing he has. You can see from a couple of games he played before the loan that he can shoot from outside the box and score. Dembele,, Paulinho, and Bentaleb either don't try this or just aren't good enough at shooting and this makes us very one dimensional.

Yes, you are correct. All games considered, not just BPL, he has a better goal to shot ratio than Paulinho, Dembele, Chadli, and Lennon.

&gt;We don't have many people right now who can make a big impact off the bench and I think he could've. He just has much more passion than a lot of our players too. What do you guys think now? 

I'm far more excited about Holtby's potential future than many of our other midfielders. He shows heart, dedication, a strong work rate, seems to be a good team influence, and he still has a lot of potential to grow.  I'd like to see him playing for us regularly right now, but I don't think he'd be getting the chances, so it's better he's at Fulham at the moment.",0,1394717096,null,0,false,0,cg1jtbn,t3_20alt0,t1_cg1jtbn,t3_20alt0,null,1432782083,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Simply because most intelligent people can distinguish between fact based prejudices and simple discrimination based on for example media articles.

I'll give you an example. It's common for people coming from Africa to have higher percentage of HIV infection, than for example in UK or from Europe. I would personally rather chose a sexual partner who doesn't come from that place, although I never ruled out such possibility if an appropriate ""candidate"" appeared. Even then I would most probably try to ask that person to for example do an HIV test. Does this make me a racist? Many people would say that yes.

You probably do remember the proposition to not let in immigrants with HIV to this country? What about if someone said ""Hey, let's not let any Africans as some of them may have HIV"".

&gt; Cook things off in bulk, think of all the lovely things you could have during the week if we cooked off five 2-3 person meals! Keep it simple to start with, make a chilli, a bolognese, a curry, a stroganoff, a stew - things like that. Means you have minimal bother during the week also. Plus, you get to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, which is where the booze is probably kept. I quite like cooking a few things off on a Friday night when I get home with a glass of wine while the missus catches up on shitty TV, listening to some music and reddit on the tablet. 

I had to go dry a couple of years ago because of my meds. To this day, I'd *kill* for a nice, cold glass of magners on a summers day. I use apple juice these days, but it just isn't the same.

true,Tbickle,flair1,,"No, I have to disagree with you on quite a few points. First of all...

&gt;**Holtby was the WORST to break down defences. Don't you remember when he was being played and Eriksen wasn't getting regular games? We were cribbing about penetration and ERIKSEN ERIKSEN ERIKSEN was being chanted all the time.**

Sure, but remember the way we were playing as a team at that point. Likely due to the way AVB had directed, we were slow, methodical, and frankly just boring and showed no creative spark. To blame that on Holtby is wrong because he was under the same restriction, but that being said he was one of the brightest sparks. 

&gt;**but on the pitch he's very average.**

Here were his stats for us this season:
&gt;22 Appearances
&gt;1025 minutes
&gt;32 Shots (87% accuracy) - 1.5/game
&gt;702 Passes (80% accuracy) - 32/game
&gt;30 Tackles
&gt;45 Crosses
&gt;4 Clearances

Out of Paulinho, Dembele, Bentaleb, Townsend, Lamela, Capoue, and Sandro, here's how he stacks up. Eriksen not included because, well, he's just better than them all.

&gt;Passes/appearance - 4th (32/game)

&gt;Passing accuracy - 7th (80%, note that Eriksen is @ 81%)

&gt;Shooting accuracy - 3rd (87%, behind Dembele (94%) and Sandro (88%)) Accuracy is third, but he was beat by players who averaged far less shots/appearance (.7 and .8 respectively).

&gt;Shots/Appearance - 3rd - 1.5 average w/87% accuracy (#1 -Townsend - 2.8/appearance w/70% accuracy  and #2 - Paulinho - 2.4/appearance w/67% accuracy) So, although he was third, he was significantly more accurate per shot than the other leaders.

&gt;Assists - 1st - 6 assists (~.3/appearance average). 2nd closest was Lamela with 3 assists and a ~.2/appearance average.

&gt;Crosses - 2nd - 45 (1.4/appearance average), 1st was Townsend with 104 and 4.2/appearance average.

&gt;Goals - Tied 2nd - 3 (Paulinho - 6, Tied with Townsend @ 3)

&gt;Goals/Shot - 2nd - .09 average (Capoue #1 with .1, but he also only had 1 goal and took 10 shots)

All things considered, he is not an ""average"" player. His pasing accuracy is lower, but he's making more difficult passes similarly to Eriksen and your success rate is bound to be lower (i.e. Eriksen's rate of 81%). 

He creates more chances and pressure up top than the others with the best overall combination of leading in assists, second in crosses, third in shot creation, second in goals, and (with Capoue's outlier stat that pushes him out of the lead) 2nd in goal/shot average.

That is NOT an average player especially when you consider the slow, methodical, and low pressure system that AVB had us running.

&gt;**but he isn't close to what Eriksen is nor is he close to being ""the player we need"" as of now.**

Nobody in our midfield is close to being Eriksen's equal, but if there were, it would probably be Holtby.

&gt;**He has ""passion"" and is ""hard working"" but that doesn't help with shit in terms of goals, assists and points.**

Actually, looking at the stats that ""passion"" and ""hard working"" attitude looks pretty good.

&gt;**But his energy, 75% of the time does not transform to adding to build-up play going forward. With Lennon and Townsend in the squad, we don't have to worry about playing slow.**

Holtby is not slow, firstly, and secondly the problem with Lennon and Townsend is that for all that speed, there's little gained from the end of it. 

&gt;**Holtby was the WORST to break down defences.**

The stats don't back you up on this. The person with the highest assist total and average, second in crossing, and highest goal/shot ration and third in shot creation couldn't break down defenses?  

It makes this look all the more comical...

I also hope Garay plays, because he gives us more solidity in defense and he is good at making good attacking passes.

In midfield, I'd like to see a trio of Fejsa, R. Amorim and Enzo Perez so that we can try to win the midfield battle.

On the wings, it doesn't matter too much. Salvio might not play because I think he hasn't trained since arriving in London (he is constipated apparently?). Sulejmani does a good job for Gaitan.

I've definitely seen it in Denmark and Italy, two countries that still have either decent manufacturing industry and/or a reasonable average wage that is enough to support a family on. It's international, with different flavours depending on region, in the same way as 'hipster' culture is and I'm not sure it's existence says anything all that much about society. 

It ignores that it's also common in most universities as well, that it basically has female equivalents that are just as popular (and that it would never be appropriate to speak of in such a way) and that its not that different from the culture of young people going back decades. The examples he gives of old style man's masculinity were seen similarly to his view of 'lads' in their day, I'm struggling to see how [David Essex](http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2011/07/01/1226085/465815-david-essex.jpg) and all his other examples are all that different from today's masculine examples (and what about [Glam Rock](http://seventiesmusic.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/marcbolan.jpg), [New Wave](http://www.strangewaysradio.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/gervais.jpg) and all that stuff), I think they just look goofy and not too styled because stylists, image consultants etc weren't all that sophisticated in those days and that's just how the past looked. 

It would be nice to have an article that looked at this kind of stuff and was by somebody who seemed like they knew what they were talking about. Also having clicked through, that [Guardian NUS 'lad summit'](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/feb/21/nus-summit--lad-culture-live-blog) mentioned is hilariously sanctimonious.

Those are his highlights for all the time he's spent at Spurs. I can list them out on one hand.

I agree that Holtby is overrated in this sub, but the point you fail to mention every time you talk about Holtby is that the alternatives are no better. Are Paulinho, Townsend, Chadli, Dembele's, highlights much better? Paulinho has a tap in against Cardiff, and one half vs Norwich; Townsend has one cross-goal (Holtby assist), and Dembele trades just as much on ""passion"" and ""hard-working"" without a creative end-product as any other player in the squad.  None of their achievements would make it on to two hands. No, he's not going to start over Eriksen, we all know this, but in his absence Holtby adds a dimension that the other's lack. His goal against Fulham, and his goal against Anzhi with the flick and volley probably puts him as our second most clinical finisher in terms of shots-to-goal ratio (although that sadly reflects more on our winger's woeful shooting &amp; Soldado's infuriating inconsistency).

You can go Botley road -&gt; Cowley in one uninterrupted trip. From Jericho/summertown, far less easy. 

Obviously it depends where you live and where you work. There was no bus from the village I lived in that would get me to Oxford in time for work, so it was a case of drive to the park and ride, then get the bus, then walk. Took 45 minutes on a good day outside of term time, more like an hour or even an hour and half on days when the traffic was particularly bad. 

On the other hand, I could cycle from my place in town to where I was working at the time in less than 10 minutes, and since I moved jobs I can do it in 5. Makes a huge difference to my life, personally. Just being able to get home in daylight during the winter is a massive bonus, and the extra half hour (or more) in bed every morning is a godsend.

It shouldn't be normal, and you shouldn't put up with it.

BUT

It's not uncommon, lecturers are hired who may be excellent researchers, and even teachers, but are then asked to teach material that they know next to nothing about.  They aren't given time to learn it in detail and to engage in research, so they teach using core text books and the internet.  

I know because I've had to do it myself.  It sucks. 

Teaching a topic you love and know a lot about is fun, you enjoy talking to students, sharing your knowledge and enthusiasm.  you welcome questions, welcome interest.

Teaching a topic you know nothing about is a nightmare - you feel like a fraud (and rightly so really), you're terrified of questions in case you're caught out, you rush through lectures to get them over, and you wish you could ditch that course and teach something you actually know about, and work on, instead.

So should it happen, no.  Should you have to put up with it, defintiely no (£9k is a lot). But it's not solely the fault of that lecturer - I obviously don't know theit details - maybe they lied when they were hired, maybe they're just really lazy.  But it's equally possible they're being asked to teach a subject they know nothing about, and they can't say no (seriously, the academic job market is a nightmare - unless you're stellar you don't rock the boat by walking out of a job on the grounds of not liking your teaching load)",0,1394723065,null,0,false,0,cg1ly6f,t3_20azic,t1_cg1ly6f,t3_20azic,null,1432783153,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
true,apr400,null,null,"Sadly that is not really the case any more. The problem is ever more students and ever fewer staff in relation, and whilst it may seem more expensive now upfront, actually the money coming in to support teaching continues to decrease. 

By way of example our student numbers have risen by ~115% in ten years, and staffing has rising by ~10% in the same period. Additionally about ~2-300 credits of new material has been added to the curriculum, and the teaching budget per student would barely buy a box of crayons.

The upshot of all this is that generally we have to teach both within and outside our areas of specialism. In my case (which is admittedly a bit at the extreme end) one course that is closely aligned to my research (very easy to teach, love it), and one course that at least is in the area of my original degree (had to do a bit of revision but not to bad) and all of my other undergraduate teaching is in areas that aren't even in the discipline I did my degree or PhD in - I basically had to teach them to myself before lecturing them. Generally most academics will be teaching one or maybe at the most two courses in areas that they deal with day-to-day and then will be covering gaps on all their other courses. 

It is a known phenomena - the managerialism of academia, leading to academics being seen as generic teaching units. [1]

I would imagine the authorities in the mosque OKed it and some of the congregation were then opposed to it, hence the turnaround. This seems obvious - the subject of the talk is about the muslim community's lack of acceptance of homosexuality so it doesn't seem surprising to have some of them be opposed to hosting it.

&gt; The mosque's message is: islam says no to homosexuality, no discussion about it. And people like you are fine with it. 

I have no context for this besides what is in the article; I don't know why the mosque refused to host this (or even if it was an outright refusal) and I don't think it's particularly fair to take that as a reflection on Islam as a whole, either. I'm also quite unconvinced that the initial aim was to do anything besides get a good-for-telly argument going on.

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"Some points:

&gt; Last season City won nothing.

Nothing *major* I'll give you that, but Mancini won the Premier League and the FA Cup in this first 2 full seasons with City.  That's better than Pellegrini's entire time in Europe thus far.

&gt; all of these players have improved their performances from last season.

All the players you listed have improved (actually, I'd say Milner is playing as well as last season for the most part) but there are also players that were better last season.  

&gt; They are a team rather than a bunch of rag tag mercenaries.

They weren't a team previously?  Is it even possible for a bunch of rag tag mercenaries to win the premier league?

&gt; Youth

Yeah young players develop over time.  That's just what happens.  The 17 year-olds of last season are now 18 year-olds, but I don't think you can credit Pellegrini with with any of that.  Mancini was much more willing to give youngsters opportunities.  Plus, don't forget how Nastasic's form has fallen off a cliff this season, and Rodwell doesn't get chances even when he is fit (which is admittedly rare).

&gt; Joe Hart [has] come back a more serious and professional player.

He had a couple of slip ups but wasn't playing nearly as badly as everyone likes to make out.  We all know that the golden gloves reward a good defence, but Hart wouldn't have won it if he was as shit as everyone likes to make out.

I'm not down on Pellegrini.  I'm perfectly happy with what he's accomplished, and the team plays entertaining football, which is nice, but not the most important thing.  It comes a distant second to winning.  I want to continue to see what Pellegrini can acheive with City, but I don't think he's earned anything beyond more time to impress so far.

The change being described here is a wholesale change of current NHS commissioning thinking and commissioning application.

**What does that mean?**
Shifting money spent hospital based care, and spending it instead on healthcare providers based in the community e.g. GP surgeries, optoms, dentists, physios, mental health facilities, nursing homes etc.
 
**What is the benefit for you and I?**
Care is closer to home and by comparison to hospital based care, less of an impact to our daily lives. 

**What is the benefit for the NHS?**
If the care can be delivered for the same quality, it could be paid at a lesser cost. 

An example is: 
Why does your GP need to refer you to the hospital for a diagnostic service, e.g. phlebotomy? 
We could pay for patients to have blood taken in their local GP surgery. 
Or even better pay for the service to take place in your local high street, say in Boots? I could pop in during my lunch break and have blood taken.

1. their cronies in the private healthcare sector.

2. private healthcare firms which will reward their malfeasance with a well-paid directorship once they leave public office. 



I agree that the NHS can be horribly inefficient, but I also fail to see how many different facets could be delivered better in the private sector for less money, with the companies providing them still turning a profit and remaining accountable - optometry is OK, but good luck finding a way to profitably manage the care of very complex mental health problems.  

Many surgeries, and certainly every surgery I have visited as a patient or as a doctor, perform their own phlebotomy (either the GP does it or the practice nurse does).  Certain tests need to be done in a hospital under certain conditions or require a very quick transfer to the lab to prevent sample degradation.  

The NHS would clearly benefit from adopting some tenets of private sector business, not least being ruthlessly efficient at all possible stages, and sacking managers who perform poorly.  For example, why does the NHS need to buy basic office or reception chairs at £300 apiece when they could just negotiate their manufacture on an exclusive basis at a much lower cost?  The same goes for thousands of other products.  And don't even get me started on the management - many of these people wouldn't last a week in a big company, yet there are more of them than doctors, and a lot of them get paid a lot more...

Put another way, if he'd done what he's done for us this season in a Crystal Palace shirt, nobody would be clamoring for Spurs to sign him up. But because he's homegrown and English, he gets a lot of love.

true,acupofteaplease,null,null,"I would say a far deeper problem is the devaluation of intelligence in our culture. I'm not talking about the pseudo intelligence typically espoused by students reading Sartre and Marx when they've only just left the bosom of parental dependency. I merely mean normal cultural sophistication and intelligence derived from experiencing life in a full and open minded fashion. 

I'm sure it was once possible to be considered legitimately working class, yet unashamedly have knowledge of culture's beyond your own, be well read and have an understanding of history, art and the wider world, combined with a sense of general rough around the edges elegance. In fact this combination was probably once considered highly appealing, a mixture of aspiration whilst simultaneously ""keeping it real"" to use the modern vernacular. A man who could traverse both the Red Lion on a Friday night, proud of his origins, and yet hold his own in polite society, and a prize catch for any young lady longing for more than older generations' typical humility in servitude. 

However these days, in many circles, any man who broaches conversation beyond fighting, fucking, fake tan and planning the big yearly holiday with the lads to some god forsaken corner of a once great European nation, where the locals no doubt look upon the British wrought devastation and weep salty tears into their plates of pitted olives and wine, is more than likely met with suspicion regards said person's sexuality, by both males and females alike I might add. 

It seems that in a culture where masculinity is in crisis. Where the notion asking whether masculinity is in even necessary is itself questioned. Masculinity has become a parody of itself, where once men felt only the need to keep reasonably trim and not be complete couch potatoes, men who explode with muscles like body builders are now exalted above all. 

There's also a strong pull towards the notion of a man as an unsophisticated stud, a monosyllabic unfeeling sexual object that simply wants to fuck, eat and leave. I would go as far as to say many women want and project this role onto men. Whilst previous generations of women were historically unavoidably overly dependent on men, many women of the later generation that is currently raising, or recently raised, their own teenage offspring were left feeling let down by their generation of men, men that promised much, but ultimately didn't compare to the conservative monogamous archetypal male of preceding generations, as the prevalence, and even complete normality of single mother families these days attests to. These parents have imbued their female offspring with a distrust for men, with the notion that they must do everything for themselves and in no sense allow themselves to fall into a position where a man could cause them any kind of financial or emotional instability.  

Thus where does that leave men? Well they are left to sell the one thing that they possess that women cannot provide for themselves, despite how much the marketeers of products such as rampant rabbits might contest. A commoditised masculine sexuality who always gets the job done and doesn't want to complicate matters with talking afterwards . A man who fulfills this role suits many modern women's needs and doesn't bring along with him the complications of a real, feeling, obligation inducing human being. 

Men instinctively and subconsciously do what they can to appeal to women, and this parody of a man is appealing to many women. A man who does otherwise will merely raise suspicions since by many women, men are assumed to be  bastards universally. In an ironic paradoxical state these days only the ""bad man"" is trusted, since he carries with him no pretense of a greater or deeper affection that might mislead a women into a position where she'll be hurt should later such affections wain or are found to be inauthentic. A woman can at least be certain that she can control and keep such a man due to the completeness of his baser desires. 

I will however add that this is all generalisation, and not indicative of even most people, I would however claim that this is how such a debased lad culture could come about in the modern age due to trends in peoples' outlooks, not universal truths about every man and women in the UK, and ultimately it's only my opinion anyway.

true,Robware,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire East,"This is based on my own observations, and probably my own sense of humour.

I've noticed that men tend to be funnier than women. I've heard this is because men jokes are more observational humour, and women joke more about their lives. For example; popular male comedians tend to do a joke like ""look at this thing, here's what I have to say about it"", and popular female comedians tend to do a joke like ""this thing happened to me, this is my humourous interpretation"". These are gross generalisations, of course, and I think there is definite overlap and more modern comedy is seeing more blurring of this segregation.

I think what really highlighted this to me is when I was at a house party during my student years and there was this one woman that was hilarious. I've found women funny before, but only when I've been part of their lives and able to relate to the joke. This woman, who I'd never met, was cracking some excellent jokes that were very relevant to the situation at present. This is something I typically find in men and it was actually quite refreshing to see a woman playing that role. Women have made the odd situational joke, but in my experience men tend to dominate that area.

On TV I think it's a lot different because it's scripted. There are some genuinely funny female characters, but I still feel humour is a field which writers still give to men (and probably not deliberately) and it can often be found by making them act 'dumber'.

That ended up a bit longer than intended, and could be interpreted as rather sexist, but it's purely my own observations.",1,1394730397,null,0,false,0,cg1p83i,t3_20b9a5,t1_cg1p83i,t1_cg1jf48,null,1432784708,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

true,[deleted],null,null,"I am a woman and I will take the piss out of myself, but only when I feel secure in my surroundings and with the other people who are there. Basically, men and women tend to have different dynamics going on in any given social group, and women don't exactly choose that for themselves any more than men do. We're judged differently by each other and society in general.

Women are regularly belittled, bossed about, blah blah. Male authority on a subject, male capability and competence etc are taken as a given, whereas women are assumed not to have those things unless they prove otherwise. It's hard to be self deprecating about something when people already assume you are incompetent. And it's not like this is the case in all situations I am in and with all people, but it happens and so sometimes, yeah, I am going to be less secure and less amenable to 'taking the piss'.

Other issues are that people respond to you differently. If I try to joke about my fat thighs people interpret that as needing to reassure me about my appearance. If I joke about a flaw it's not because I am asking for reassurance. On the other hand, given how women ARE judged so heavily and harshly over their appearance you can see why they would be more highly strung about it than guys might be.

I'd also like to add that I think men are trained not to voice their insecurities or the things they are more sensitive about, that doesn't mean that 'taking the piss' doesn't bother them. It means they aren't allowed to complain without being insulted further.

&gt;You VERY RARELY see a woman willing to take the piss out of herself,

true,Fornad,null,null,"Alright, then.

&gt; We measure higher in the rankings for standard of living, health and education (and any other ranking) than most other countries.

True, but going by that standard, Scandinavian countries are 'superior' to Britain.

&gt; We have the most developed, fair and ethical legal system on the planet.

Arguable, but since I don't want to descend into a legal debate I'll concede the point.

&gt; We invaded all but 22 countries, held dominion over a quarter of the planet

Doing so resulted in the death, starvation and enslavement of millions of people. I really, *really* don't see how this makes Britain 'superior'. There are many factors as to why Britain achieved this (geographical location and accidents of history amongst them), and not because it is inherently 'better' than other countries (other European nations have achieved similar things). Indeed, the Mongols under Genghis Khan conquered an empire almost as large as the British Empire in a much shorter time, so isn't Mongolia 'superior' to Britain by this standard?

Also, we didn't invade all but 22 countries, we've just had a military presence in all but 22. There's a difference.

&gt; we pretty much held our own in two of the greatest wars ever known.

That's historically illiterate. We held off the Germans for some time whilst they were fighting in other areas, but without the Americans and Russians, mainland Britain would have been invaded and obliterated. We simply didn't have the numbers or resources to hand.

&gt; I find the fact that you don't think we are better than other countries (putting us on par with Saudi Arabia) to be insulting.

At this point in history, Britain is a better place to live than Saudi Arabia. This is true. Go back to the European Dark Ages, however, and the Middle East was one of the centres of civilisation in the world, with advances in science and medicine Europeans could only dream of at the time. If we were speaking in 1200 AD, you could be making the same argument for the Caliphate, or indeed China. You have to understand that your point of view is inherently subjective and limited in this respect.

&gt; We are better.

So, to the main point of your argument. Like many other world powers, Britain has contributed a great deal to world civilisation. Britons are responsible for hundreds of inventions the world relies on, have had a huge influence on music, theatre, literature and the arts, and Britain itself has a long and fascinating history.

However, nationality is an accident of birth, and I find it odd when people are 'proud' of it, as if they themselves have achieved something. You are proud that Britain is wealthier and more powerful than most other countries, which is also an odd thing to be 'proud' about. As individuals, we'd be embarrassed to admit that we feel proud that we make more money and have more power than the guy down the street and to assert our 'superiority' over him, so I'm not sure why so many people consider it acceptable when nations are involved, rather than individuals.

You have to understand that the nationalist idea has become common in the last two hundred years. In feudal times, people were less nationalistic - instead of singing anthems and saluting flags, they swore allegiance to a particular person - a king or a lord. People promised to obey him and fight for him. In less orderly places people swore to obey local clan chiefs or various types of lords.

Kings used to claim that they must be obeyed because they were acting as God's representative on earth - in other words, they claimed a divine right to rule. In modern times this idea has become less and less plausible for many reasons, and so if people no longer believe the myth that the king is God's representative, they are even less likely to believe that a government made up of bankers and industrialists had been sent by God. This is why the nationalist idea became necessary. People were taught that obedience to the government was their duty to the nation. By the use of songs and symbols and ceremonies, the nation was made to seem like some supernatural, overarching entity, just as God had been in the past.

true,Clackpot,,Push your own fucking button,"You need to try edible coleslaw, not the repackaged Saturday-night-vom they flog in pisspoor little tubs in the supermarkets.

Clackpot's proper coleslaw :-

* 250g hard cabbage (e.g. red, sweetheart, primo), cut into long, fine shreds with a *sharp* knife.
* 2 medium/large carrots, grated on the coarse side of a box grater.
* 1 large onion, finely sliced, not in rings!
* A shit-ton of good quality mayonnaise.
* A tablespoon of sherry vinegar. Lemon juice will also suffice. 
* *Optional* - full fat natural yoghurt, the thicker the better.
* *Optional* - a teaspoon of cumin seed.

Mix the cabbage, onion, and carrot in a large bowl. Add the vinegar, slather with mayo, enough to coat all of it but not actually swimming, and mix it all together. Add cumin seed if you like a hint of spice.

Use half and half mayo/yoghurt to halve the fat content. Really thick, indulgent yoghurt like Total will work wonders.

Think about the colours. Red cabbage is tasty but will make your slaw the colour of red wine! If using a green cabbage then use a red onion - the red/green/orange combination of the vegetables is very attractive.

That gets you a honking great pile of coleslaw, that knocks spots off the pisspoor supermarket tubs, at a fraction of the price.

I agree with you that where care is complex and needs specialist support - then care in dedicated sites, MH trusts, hospitals etc is appropriate. The savings will come from moving those non-urgent/routine treatments that can still be safely administered in the community. 

Savings can be made for the non-urgent/routine treatments as providers will likely offer them at less than PbR rates. 
If they don't, the incentive to NHS commissioners to move the activity out of hospitals will be reduced, (not gone....but reduced). 
Where commissioners are savvy enough; they will procure for the common non-urgent/routine treatments and be able to command further reductions whilst retaining the same level of quality. 

Community providers will be made accountable through contract arrangements. Monitor for 2014/15 have supported the development of the NHS Standard Contract to introduce greater amount of sanctions for poor performance. However it is up to NHS commissioners whether those sanctions are applied. 

The use of Phlebotomy was to illustrate for other readers; we should note that Phlebotomy provision is not uniform across England. 
Not all tests within Phlebotomy is suitable in the community, but some are. 

Savings through back office functions are made by the NHS, by purchasing their goods through procurement frameworks. 
The argument that you have suggested is often used and there are two key points you need to take away. 
1) Savings are identified at aggregate level and 2) the NHS needs to be compliant by their SFIs and EU regulations. 
Dependent on SFIs certain levels of spends are discretionary. 

Ideally staff should be purchasing through established frameworks for their goods; to combat this issue, this is about educating staff on appropriate purchasing behaviours.  
Savings made for consumables and non-clinical items is small compared to the potential savings made by shifting non-urgent/routine services out to the community. 

On sacking managers who perform poorly? I can see this to be more relevant on the provider side e.g. within hospitals.
Circle removed the poor performing services and managers when they got into Hitchingbrooke; its only a matter of time where other providers and NHS FTs begin to do this as well.  Where hospitals have not achieved FT status - the turnover of service managers is less compared to the FTs. 

On the commissioning side, clinicians are now responsible for the purchase of your local health services 
i.e. the establishment of Clinical Commissioning Groups (who also happen to be your local GPs). Are you suggesting we fire the local GPs if poor performance is found? ",0,1394733649,null,0,false,0,cg1qt8y,t3_20a80h,t1_cg1qt8y,t1_cg1n489,null,1432785445,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Of course! But there are reasons why Moffat's series are drastically different from RTD's. And there's a reason Moffat-written episodes under RTD head writing are better than Moffat's episodes under his own head writing. As a head writer, you're making 99% of the story decisions and you have complete power over editing other writers' episodes.

So when it comes to Matt Smith's Doctor, Moffat COULD HAVE kept him intimidating and imposing as he was in series 6, instead he became even more silly and seemingly useless. Moffat COULD HAVE kept the scripts focused on Sci-Fi and intelligence rather than fantasy and love, but he didn't. Moffat COULD HAVE (well, maybe not) written compelling characters with depth and development, but he chose to keep relationships and personality traits shallow. He created the characters, and the other writers had to do with that what they could. Poor guys. 

P.S. Toby Whithouse seems to be surviving the Moffat era quite nicely, and he's written several of the 'deeper' episodes these days (""The Vampires of Venice"", ""The God Complex"". New frontrunner?

I was discussing this sort of thing with a colleague today (maxillofacial surgeon).  He was recently performing charity work repairing cleft palate deformities in India, with a group almost entirely comprised of clinical staff, self-started as a newly created charity.  He stated that whilst working in a reasonably modern well equipped hospital in India (equivalent to a DGH in this country), his team achieved throughput rates several times what he achieves in the NHS for the same sorts of operations.  His group was autonomous and met regularly to discuss targets and performance and their four-month tour went without a single hitch.  This included theatre time, anaesthetics, recovery, a small ward they had, and also post-op followup and clinics.  Any problems were dealt with and overall strategy improved.

What was different?  Was it the lack of management?  I don't know.  

In principle, I am not against private provision of some services.  However, I am not sure how the savings are made, whilst also allowing the creation of profit, whilst maintaining or improving the service.

just doing a quick read, but it seems that there is a very slight skew occurring in it. They have reduced the number of responses it requires, (3.7). 

They have also eliminated all addresses that are generally occupied exclusively by pensioners (thus it is no longer a true stratification), in addition that they now regularly include nursing accommodation into the results which they guarantee will return a positive employment figure by making sure that the first wave of responses they ask for fall outside of student residency months. The boost selection seems a bit wishy washy on explanation, and they are increasingly relying on boost figures. 

The only external figures I can see that they take into account is the census data for cross reference and they make no use of JSA data in coming up with the figures. Now admittedly, I have only read the first 30 or so pages, so I may well be wrong in these accusations and I reserve the right to admit I was wrong :) but still, there seems to be a lot of special rules involved in selection considering that this is meant to be an unbiased stratification.",0,1394735759,null,0,false,0,cg1rulw,t3_20820w,t1_cg1rulw,t1_cg1hkti,null,1432785934,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In any case, Sherwood must agree somewhat as he's fielding two strikers tonight - but Kane instead of Soldado.

Overlapping runs can be made from anyone.  The phrase is more commonly associated with full backs, but anyone can do it.  It just refers to a midfielder running past the striker to be the most forward-placed player.  Teams like Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool do it all the time.  Bale did it frequently for us last season.  It's pretty much the only thing Christiano Ronaldo does, and to great effect.

One of our biggest problems in attack this season has been the lack of those forward-bursting runs from midfield, which when done well, overload opposition defences and allow for through balls to be played.

Fryers, if I remember correctly, was also named to the bench in the last league game, again, don't think he's unfit and I can't see why he isn't starting over Naughton. He's been solid defensively and hasn't shit himself in possession much either. Odd, has to be fitness related or Sherwood is crazy.

To put Naughton at leftback and also put Eriksen wide left(assuming) is even dumber because it's going to leave Naughton more exposed. Is Sherwood purposely trying to torture players by sticking them at leftback when it's not a good spot for them? He's inviting a weakness for Benfica to attack, and they're happy to get the ball out wide.

12:35 - joinDOTA|d3r_I3enny: hey there

12:36 - joinDOTA|d3r_I3enny: I'm the ""+1"" from yesterdays match. Do you have a minute?

12:36 - shagaire: hi

12:37 - shagaire: and yes i know

12:37 - joinDOTA|d3r_I3enny: https://support.gamesports.net/41869/BMkhpvgM

12:37 - joinDOTA|d3r_I3enny: I take it that this is your ticket about the match.

12:37 - shagaire: yes

12:38 - joinDOTA|d3r_I3enny: The msg is blank. Technical stuff. I guess you wrote a long text?

12:38 - shagaire: correct

12:39 - shagaire: pretty much my log from the team captain yesterday

12:39 - shagaire: and whats on the game page

12:39 - shagaire: http://www.joindota.com/en/leagues/matc ... -darkstorm

12:39 - joinDOTA|d3r_I3enny: So you either have to send a new, shorter one in order to explain it to the admin 
assigned to your group or talk to me.

12:40 - shagaire: well do you know the details?

12:40 - shagaire: i would think so

12:40 - joinDOTA|d3r_I3enny: ya that's the reason why I get involved in this

12:40 - shagaire: we could have taken a default win yesterday for a no show

12:41 - shagaire: as you can see from the match page

12:41 - joinDOTA|d3r_I3enny: I read through the comments

12:41 - shagaire: 48 hours notice was not given and we reluctently postpone

12:41 - shagaire: then the team uses two standinds

12:41 - shagaire: one a profesional caster

12:41 - shagaire: and you

12:42 - shagaire: while the captain sits out?

12:42 - shagaire: but is in the lobby

12:42 - shagaire: and others in the team are online?

12:42 - shagaire: at 3pm

12:42 - shagaire: we could have had our better team

12:43 - shagaire: i wasnt happy to start with that 5 of us are online at 3pm waiting for them to show

12:43 - shagaire: none of them added me on stream

12:44 - shagaire: steam

12:45 - shagaire: i can also see that other teams are not happy with what happened

12:45 - shagaire: TS captain also posted on that page

12:49 - joinDOTA|d3r_I3enny: let me make one thing clear. the standins used were not against the rules. Tobi is no professional player nor is he part of any other team. And I play for a german starter div team with 0-10. So we're not really punching above your weight. Regardless of what happened, the guys from True B@llers had a lot of fun and I'm sure you had some too as you haven't faced a too well perfoming team obviously with your 13-1 score. Nevertheless the score has absolutely no impact on True B@llers while it might have on your team. **If that's the case I'd take into account that you're missing 1-2 points due to this match.**

12:50 - shagaire: I know on paper the standins are not against the rules

12:50 - joinDOTA|d3r_I3enny: The league is supposed to be fun. especially for the starter div teams. There is no reasn to have hard feelings here.

12:50 - shagaire: but do you REALLy think that lettin ga profesional caster play AND pick the team

12:51 - joinDOTA|d3r_I3enny: That's why I'm writting to you as I know there is mature way to work this out

12:51 - shagaire: after we postopne for you

12:51 - joinDOTA|d3r_I3enny: no ""you"" here. Was asked, had time, played the game. That's it. the team holds absolutely no value to me

12:52 - shagaire: yes the league is suppost to be fun but people are also required to be respectfull

12:53 - shagaire: leaving 5 of us hanging at 4pm waiting for a team to show up to then makes jokes about ""playing tobi"" cos we are top of the table

12:54 - shagaire: you think thats fun for us?

12:54 - shagaire: plus what does that comment mean

12:55 - shagaire: haven't faced a too well perfoming team obviously with your 13-1 score

12:55 - shagaire: again thats disrespecfull to us and the other teams

12:55 - shagaire: who are you to tell us and them that?

12:56 - joinDOTA|d3r_I3enny: My point was that you might enjoyed the hard game just like the others did

12:57 - shagaire: right so what you are saying is that, this team used standins to make the game harder so we have more fun

12:57 - shagaire: thats some great logic

12:57 - shagaire: i'll have to remember that when we need to wi na game in the next weeks by giving some pro a call

12:58 - shagaire: im sure that the team we play will have fun when im watching them get raped on dotatv

12:58 - joinDOTA|d3r_I3enny: wasn't my point that i was trying to make.

12:59 - joinDOTA|d3r_I3enny: but obviously doesn't matter what I say. So far you turned everything against me even though I'm trying to reach out to you

12:59 - shagaire: you are not trying to reach out to me

This group of people descended down into the acid house rave scene, which still exists in its pure form today, it just isn't a new scene anymore, however I've been to some massive clubs even in central London where it still goes on.

You also had another group of people in the 60's and 70's who were basically posers, interested in going to bars and pubs and basically looking good and pulling women.

I think the problem is that a lot of bars and pubs starting playing ""clubby"" music when it became popular in the late 80's, and so people think the two movements have mixed, but they haven't really.

You're right earlier that men are disproportionately represented, that's hopefully getting better these days, but it's still clearly the case.

Racism, sexism against women, sectarianism, etc etc are all gone from the TV. All that's left is emasculation. 

Since there's no longer any other targets, men get it by default now.

The disappointing thing is not so much that men will suffer, it's that nothing has changed.

If OP's partner can probably get ""a mortgage for 90-100k"", then assuming OP has gone with x5 income, that means a max income of 20k.

For a BTL mortgage where neither applicant is either an owner occupier or has a pre-existing BTL property, the min income is usually 25k. 

Remortgaging a BTL back to residential mortgage is easy enough once there are two incomes to make it affordable. Getting a BTL to start with when not being owner occupiers and on an income potentially less than 25k is a good deal harder.

But I'm totally rooting for Denton. I want her to win, whatever that means. If she did have those cops killed, then I'm sure she had her reasons. After all, with the rampant corruption in the police in this series (about the only cop who hasn't done anything wrong is Hargreaves and the viewer is meant to think he's an officious twat), having a few of them killed off is probably best for society. 

Meanwhile, over the last 5 episodes, Denton has escaped an assassination attempt, had her head shoved in a toilet seat by her work colleagues, been transferred to a different job for supposed incompetence, had to cope with a noisy neighbour, had her mother die while she's in jail, been accused of murder and negligence, been spied upon, been put in prison,  been beaten by prison inmates, been scalded by prison warders, been shoved in a car boot, been waterboarded and lost her cat.

Anyone who comes out of that lot still standing (and occasionally managing to turn the tables on her neighbour, those smug hypocritical pricks in the interrogation room, and on the kidnappers) gets my vote. If she's innocent, fine, but if she's guilty, so much the better. The universe has been mercilessly shitting on this woman for the whole run and if she needs to frame and murder a few police officers to even the score, so be it! Go Denton!

true,db1000c,uk,United Kingdom,"The point of the article is a fair one, and one I tend to agree with. However it's left in stranded in a sea of bitterness and snobbishness from the author.

However, he has a point. Modern society no longer has a definite message for it's men. There is no longer a clear role for males. The UK most definitely does have a 'masculinity crisis' (for want of a better phrase).

I'm a young man, 21 years old, and I consider myself to be included in this crisis - anything else would be simply patronising to the rest of 'man-dom'.

Again, there simply is no clear role for men or a clear state of mind promoted for men.

There are reasons that so few men under 25 get married as opposed to women of the same age group for example. Or why white working class males do so poorly in education now.

Essentially men aren't sure what is expected from them now. The once traditional paths, lifestyles, and roles are gone. And of course that isn't necessarily a bad thing with regards to equal rights for women.

Ultimately young men are just sort of left to it. There are no longer traditional male industries or jobs. There aren't really even typically male past-times left.

It's not a bad thing because in the end you can do whatever the fuck you want in life, and that feeling is amazing! On the one had we are totally liberated, free to go where we want and do what we want, because no one really has any clue as to what's expected from us anymore. There is no longer a 'normal age' for a man to settle down with a family, there are no longer 'normal' jobs that you *should* be doing, there are no longer obviously 'masculine' or 'feminine' subjects for you to study at university.

On the other hand, the majority (or at least a very large chunk) of young men are now choosing the path critiqued in the article. One of ""it doesn't matter where I'm going as long as I'm buff as fuck and shagging every fit bird in my way"". This is dangerous and sad. They believe they are being 'alpha' but in fact they are flying in the face of everything that masculinity has stood for for millennia.

To be honest when I hire i'm looking for experience and past projects more than how they did at uni. Sometimes I wonder if i'd prefer someone who spent their 18-21 time working on code, than someone that has been to uni. It's that bad. The consistency from uni graduates just isn't there to rely on that alone.

Having said that, I do take into account what I mentioned in the first paragraph too. The general professional development you get from someone who's been to uni.

AVB turned out to be another disaster. The promotion of youth coach Sherwood to give him his first job in management was absolute joke.

Aside from his constant hiring and firing managers, which deprives the club from having any stability, Levy also insists on having a director of football which failed miserably under Comolli and is failing again under Baldini.

The reason Spurs have risen from mid-table to top six under Levy is not because of Levy's presence at the club. It's because all major clubs have begun to maximise their marketing potential off the park meaning Spurs have the ability to pay significantly more in transfer fees and wages than most clubs in the league.

true,raspy01,eng-lancashire,Britain's Longest Cul-de-Sac,"That's the way they are trying to pass it off, but it is misleading. Skilled staff start off at the lowest point on a ""band"", as per agenda for change job salary requirements - let's say 20,000 a year. This band has various pay points along it but for the sake of ease let's say 10, one every 1000 quid. It also has a maximum pay point, say 30,000 a year. The exact bands and pay points are available online [here](http://www.nhscareers.nhs.uk/working-in-the-nhs/pay-and-benefits/agenda-for-change-pay-rates/).

Every twelve months, the staff member gains experience and greater expertise in their role, and as such is worth more money to the NHS in terms of the skills they bring to the table - hence they are more valuable as a staff member and can be rewarded for this by moving up one pay point within their band, so they are now paid 21,000 a year.

However, this pay increase is also based on satisfactory completion of mandatory practices - I think the main one is a yearly appraisal by the line manager, but there is also mandatory training. If the appraisal shows that the staff member has not met the development goals given to them, this pay point increase can be withheld until the staff member shows they have met the targets of their appraisal. So it is not a pay rise, as the government are talking about it, it is a performance related pay increase. 

Please note I am merely a lackey in the NHS, not a manager so I might be wrong, this is just my understanding of it all. Also, the numbers given are not inclusive of tax, which really nukes the impact of each pay point increase.

I'm not especially clued up on the latest legislation relating to freedom of speach and protest (there's so much) - but an old classic which I've witnessed being used on many occasions is [section 14.] (http://www.latentexistence.me.uk/section-14-police-try-to-order-you-around/) 

You're right, you don't need permission to start a static protest.  But the moment a police officer arrives you do.  I've been to multiple static demos where as soon as the police arrive,  a designated protest area is defined (usually a car park) ~5 minutes walk away from the focus of your attention (say a council building).  Depending on whether they feel like arresting someone they declare the maximum number of people allowed to be at the protest to be either slightly higher or lower than the number present. 

I've been told that we're not allowed to have any banners visible from a road for health and safety reasons - since drivers might try to read the banners and lose control of their vehicles (a particuarly annoying arguement when it's a street with lots of comercial billboards aimed at those in cars-  pointed at the road), they can also decree no megaphones and if they're being particuarly mischeivous - don't shout it's disturbing the peace (being noticed and  sometimes distruptive - to a certain degree - is kind of integral to the tactic of protest.  It's not recreation, people protest for reasons they concider very important - there are much more fun ways to spend your time.

Oh and my favourite.  When you have to disperse. If the police are being dicks (which is often the case if your protest disagrees with a Daily Mail perspective), then you have to get out of the area fairly quickly and try not to look like you're walking with anyone - but the thing that really fucks me off is that while you're 'not being detained' they can and sometimes do arrest you for breach of section 14 if simply want to leave (and go home - cos no-one can see the demo and it's pointless, or find a toilet) from the designated protest area before the time they have decreed the protest will end.  You have to convince a senior officer to speak to you and ask permission to go home, which sometimes they refuse cos they 'don't believe that you are no longer protesting'.

But then sometimes they just leave you be and let you protest - really depends on a combination of the personality of the commading officers present and the orders they have received from on high.",0,1394748496,null,0,1394749356,0,cg1y7v7,t3_2099ov,t1_cg1y7v7,t1_cg1i5ii,null,1432789005,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Benfica are a better side. Superior cohesion and superior tactics.

Paulinho was a passenger in both defence and attack, I would prefer to see a youth player in his place for the reverse fixture (Siggy or Holtby would also be great) - I imagine Fernandinho or Willian (or Mkhitaryan) will nab his Brazilian jersey. Some players showed heart tonight: Walker, Kaboul, Sandro and Eriksen (my MOTM). Which is at the least encouraging.

Sherwood is out of his depth. I think that is pretty obvious, again he came up against a real manager tonight and Jorge Jesus wiped the floor with him. Sherwood is now 0-4 against decent teams (Arsenal, Benfica, City, Chelsea), that doesn't bode well for the upcoming Derby nor the match against Liverpool.

I would like to see Lloris, Walker, Kaboul, Jan, Rose, Sandro and Eriksen on the team sheet against the scum this weekend.

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"&gt; Krishnaiyer discusses the turning point of when watching the Premier League changed in the United States from being an underground culture to a mainstream viewing audience.

Call me cynical, but that turning point has simply not happened yet.  Of course, as an Englishman living in Los Angeles, my experience will be different to those around me.

I've come from a place where coverage and conversation around the league is non-stop.  The Premier League is everywhere and if you want to avoid it, you'd have to make a conscious effort to isolate yourself.

I am now living in a place where admittedly quite a lot of people have an opinion on the league, but that opinion is almost inevitably ""Chicharito isn't playing enough"".  Living here I'm the one isolating myself by following the league.  I know plenty of people I could talk to about baseball and basketball (if I knew literally anything about either sport), but the Premier League is very much a niche interest.

I'm sure when you've grown up here and seen it go from nothing to occasional Man United bumper stickers, it must feel like the league has really arrived, but it hasn't.  It really hasn't.

true,TheBlueNomad,null,null,"1.  He was never the main set piece taker and his corners are not good. Since we no longer have good free kick takers, he might as well start taking them.
2. There is no big reason why he shouldn't be starting, especially against Villa away. Jose even mentioned Eto'o is good playing at home but not-so-good away from home. That is why he only scores goals when we are playing at the Bridge. Torres is also injured. I am sure Ba won't be worse than these two strikers. He has been on the bench for too long. But, he has kept his mouth shut and concentrated on playing.
3. Diego Costa. After what happened with Torres! price, age and form should always be on the very top of our list when purchasing a striker. Being a household name, shouldn't be our main reason of going after a striker. If his form is deteriorating due to injury, we should definitely forget about that player. For that reason i will go with Diego Costa. He is physical player that is suited for EPL and our playing style. He is also only 25 years old. He is hungry and on his way to be among the best strikers in the world. I would have chosen Suarez, but i would hate seeing us fill the pockets of Liverpool once again. Aguero has already made history with another EPL team. We should try our luck on finding another good striker from another League.

But seriously, Sterling and Cou are on another level than Suso.  Suso is good, but Sterling is the ~5th best winger in the PL, and Coutinho is, well, Coutinho.  Sure he's had his down times, but he holds the ball much better than Suso and can play truly unbelievable through passes.  Suso has similar vision and similar potential for passing ability, but right now Coutinho is a fair bit ahead of him.",0,1394749580,null,0,false,0,cg1yqah,t3_20bxg8,t1_cg1yqah,t1_cg1sp3l,null,1435497050,14,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,14

The first one was a very well executed set piece play that had Luisao start deeper and then make a run around a setup screen to as to generate space for him to attack the ball. Kane got stuck with his man, not knowing that Kaboul had been blocked by the screen and so Luisao was left unmarked. It was a great set piece play that worked to a T.

The second set piece saw two of our players completely misjudge the initial ball in and Hugo was forced to parry the ball wide off of a reaction save low. He did well to prevent it from going back into the mix, but was unfortunate to have it go directly to Luisao's feet. Again, not Kaboul's fault.

That transition is on the first team to make and we've really not been able to do it right.

Which is why I want Louis Van Gaal. He'll take the talent we currently have, remove the chaff, and then bring up youth to fill the gaps. Within a few years we'll not only have a very solid home grown youth component in our first team but we'll also have a good blueprint for promoting youth up.

Xavi, Iniesta, Schweinsteiger, Alaba, Muller, and other world beaters were nowhere near as good or important before Louis Van Gaal found their right position and play style.
