I volunteered because, call me paranoid or deluded, but I think the UK in its current format is withering and eroding English national identity under the guise of Britain. Just recently this whole 'british Values' thing is going to be taught only in English schools which will cause further disassociation by Scottish and wielsh who will start seeing it as just another English flag.One of the principles of the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly was to preserve and protect each nations identity from erosion, which is absolutely fair but what isn't fair is that England was never offered the same deal as our comrades in Wales and Scotland, we were offered 'Regional Assemblies' which was rejected outright in its first stage in the north, what a stupid and divisive idea that was, nothing good would have come from it and I'm proud the north rejected it.

I'm not with them anymore, left just over a year ago, they're not a centrist party anymore and have since started advocating leaving the EU, English independence and freezing immigration, three things I'm completely against.

You should see their EU election broadcast, sums it all up what that once respectable party has become nothing but a xenophobic little Englander party.

true,LinuxMage,eu,Luffbra,"Ex Yodel Supervisor here.

There are 2 types of drivers employed by Yodel. Self Employed drivers with marked Transit size vans that operate from the depot.

And Home Couriers that work on a per-parcel delivered rate. The parcels are supplied to their houses each morning by a van or small truck driver from the depot.

The depots are sparse, few and far between.

To give you an idea, there are just 3 in the entire midlands. (east and west).

I live right near one of the major East Midlands depots.

To give you an idea, the region it covers is Corby, northants in the south to Hucknall, Notts in the north.

Now the Home Couriers are given a set of basic rules to work by, however, getting them to actually do things as asked is near impossible. Be aware that Yodel are *crying out* for Home Couriers constantly. So, they will often overlook and ignore those that break the rules unless something major happens. (Like a home courier on my watch had his car stolen full of parcels because he left it running whilst trying to deliver the parcel.)

Its the home couriers that everyone complains about. The van drivers are far more accountable, and far more professional.

Modric was our talisman, but sadly he had his eyes set on greener pastures. He reluctantly played a full year with Spurs after requesting a transfer, and although his play on the pitch was brilliant his attitude was not so much.

Van Der Vaart was also brilliant and he loved the club despite his short tenure. Always busted his butt off and brought it when it mattered most. He left the club because he thrived in a free-roaming role that would not have worked well under Andre Villas-Boas' system. Allegedly he tried saving his marriage too by moving closer to his wife's work in Hamburg.

Berbatov was also brilliant, but like Modric he wanted a bigger stage. There's a joke that he was snuck from London to Manchester in the boot of a Mercedes or something to finalize his transfer.

Second day, it was thrown back out on the van route which is only in your area possibly 4 hours a day. It was impossible for him to deliver in the window you had requested. He was probably just as angry at the depot for placing it back on the van route when it should have been re-directed to a Home Corier instead who CAN deliver in that window.

For sake of ease, the van drivers deliver 8am -2pm. The Home Couriers deliver 2PM-9PM.

They're next shown in 2012, where they've clearly multiplied and been fruitful.   A short Dalek history as I understand it:

*	Fun fact, there was a Dalek Civil War, those who supported Davros and those who supported a black “supreme” Dalek.  That ended with the destruction of their home Skaro. 
*	The Cult of Skaro (4 Named Daleks) from the Doctor/Donna series, were refugees from the Time War locked in nothingness.
*	The Daleks at the end of that series are from Davros’s own cells, after Dalek Caan (from the  Cult of Skaro) went back in time to the Time War to save Davros.   Caan could do this because he had knowledge of the future, and such, it's why he was cray-cray.
*	In 2010, Victory of the Daleks, they use the Progenitor, has ORIGINAL Dalek DNA in it.  These Daleks were also refugees from Skaro’s Civil War (as I understand it).
*	The Daleks made from the Progenitor, are “New Paradigm” Daleks, they deemed themselves more worthy, and killed the unpure refugees.
* Fun fact their colors meant things:  representing their role in Dalek society: red, Drone; blue, Strategist; orange, Scientist; yellow, Eternal and white, Supreme – although we don’t really see their colors anymore, these ARE the current Daleks.
*	By the 2012 series, the Dalek’s numbers have grown again, they've also established a Parliament (wtf…), here the Doctor is wiped from their memory banks.
*	The Daleks lay siege to Trenzalore, where they eventually absorb Tasha Lem from whom they regain their knowledge of the Doctor.

It highlights how they didn't really take their manifesto seriously up until now. Because a manifesto is a list of promises you make for if you wind up in power, and UKIP weren't so daft as to think they were in it to win it. It left them more time to build up the case against the European Union, which up until recently was all they really cared about as a whole. 

I think this is the first time we can take their manifesto seriously because this time it's not expected to be read as a booklet produced by a fringe party who might get their deposit back if they're lucky (see: Lib Dems).

Oh, and he's also racked up about £50m in transfer fees. 

Coutinho is 22 now, and he's never scored more than 5 goals a season in all competitions. That's shocking. By 22, Mata had racked up double figures twice and picked up a WC winners medal. In his first two seasons as a professional with Valencia, he scored more goals than Coutinho has managed in his entire career. It's not even a debate. Coutinho's good, but not Mata good. Mata has a better set-piece delivery, is a better passer, a better finisher, a more incisive dribbler, gets more goals and assists and delivers consistently in big games. He's played on the wing, as a #10, up front for Spain and a few times as a CM. He's less athletic and doesn't tackle as well, defensive ability is the only thing that Coutinho has going for him in this argument.

But after seven seasons [in the Premier League], I had in my mind that I needed a change; I needed a new challenge and something that really excited me. Something that gives me the passion I need to play football. Obviously, I could see how the season in Chelsea was going to be. They signed a new striker that was expecting to play, and I need to feel the-… you know this feeling of being important, and something new. As I said before, when I had the call from AC Milan, it was everything I needed - very passionate supporters and a great club in a situation where you have to risk everything; Milan has to go back to the top three position in the table. I need to feel happy to play football again, to score goals, to be an important part in a team again. And so it was perfect for me.

Second day, tracking showed an incomplete address, which made me wonder how they could have attempted delivery on the previous day - my flat is not difficult to find, either. Third day the same, as well as a requested redelivery by the recipient, which I didn't do. The third day was when I checked the tracking, and called Yodel, who were very sympathetic but confirmed that the address was correct on the file and rearranged for delivery today. It arrived this morning, but the package was half-open on arrival (although the product seems complete and works well).

I've read stories of men being stabbed, burnt, beaten while they slept, and as soon as the police shows up they get arrested, not the woman. 

This is why so many men over there are unable to deal with violence, they know if they resist at all then they can easily be arrested for it. In my opinion, this is why it's important to stress that domestic violence is something that's started by both men and women, not just men, or we could end up with a similar system over here.

A number 10 needs different attributes and IMO Coutinho isn't a 10, he's CM in a midfield 3 or I believe it's where he's best at. I've seen how a ""real"" #10 plays plenty, so you can try to act as if you know more and see things better so go ahead. If you followed the discussion I was pointing out individual attributes and aspects of their game. I in no way said mata was bad or said Coutinho is better. My first comment was exaggerating and vague but my 2nd response to you shows I did agree there are more parts to Mata's game than I first said but never did I state who was better or argue for Coutinho being better and never did I state mata wasn't a good #10. So I respect your opinion, I don't respect your snide stuck up comment that I don't watch or know what to look for in a #10 or just in the course of watching a game.

**Other options:**

**Stipe Perica** - He's huge yes, but his finishing needs working on. I think he could potentially be good in the premier league when he's a bit older, as he's big and strong, but you have to remember he's just 19 at the moment. Still got plenty of time to grow.

**Andre Schurrle** - Never seems to work as a striker for us. However, I think he could do it this year with a lot more to get onto. If Drogba/Remy/Costa gets injured he could be a good 3rd choice. 

**Joao Rodriguez** - Not ready yet, still young at 18. Hopefully will get to play a bit at Bastia this season after that guy got banned for attacking Motta (I hope). 

**Islam Feruz** - I think he's too small simply put. He's a decent striker but I just don't think he could live up to the physicalities of the prem. There's a difference between players like David Silva and Santi Cazorla, and a 5ft4 striker with no real experience

**Bertrand Traore** - Playing striker atm for Vitesse, although they are not doing so well. I don't think striker is his position, I think he's more of a winger.

---

&gt;__Squad numbers__ are used in association football to identify and distinguish players on the field. Numbers were originally used to also indicate position, with starting players being assigned numbers 1–11. However these numbers bear little or no significance in the modern game other than players' favourite numbers, and the numbers available. The main numbers (1–11) are often still worn by players of the previously associated position.The number 10 is one of the most iconic numbers in football history, being worn by the likes of [Lionel Messi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi), [Pelé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pel%C3%A9) and [Diego Maradona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona) among others, as is the number 7, being worn by [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo), [Raúl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Gonz%C3%A1lez), [David Beckham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham) and many others, typically team captains. Number 9 is usually awarded to a prolific forward, for example [Fernando Torres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Torres) when at [Liverpool F.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) or [Luis Suarez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Suarez) at [F.C. Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.C._Barcelona).

Immigration is being brought up big time here with the while Rotherham shabang, the looming threat of IS and the ever present EU/Eastern European debate lurking on the sidelines. Nestled below that is the economy, particularly continuing refrain that the recovery, insofar as it is mathmatically very strong and continuing apace (albeit principally in the service sector) is not being felt by those at the lower end of the income spectrum. Yadda yadda, more manufacturing, bonuses, ""Etonomics"" etc etc. Linked to this is the whole unemployment debacle, where the rates are falling but mainly in London and the South East. A rising trend in Britain at the moment is the (imho) misguided belief that London vacuums up all the money unfairly and spends beyond its means whilst the rest of the country is left to languish.

Then we have the NHS. Privatisation is a big no no for a lot of people, and whilst I suspect it's probably on hold until the election, if it does come about it's going to cause a real storm.

There's also the Scottish independence referendum. It had looked like an easy victory for ""no"", now it might be a bit closer. Despite what /r/Scotland would have you believe, no it isn't a cut and dry issue of the great leader Salmond ushering in a new age of democracy and egalitarianism versus the evil, insidious, warmongering Better Together campaign that may as well be Thatcher reincarnate.

Labour are in the ascendancy but hampered by Milliband, plus the inability to really shake off the idea that they're really going to change anything. The Tories, for a governing party, aren't doing that badly, but they've lost the most ground on the right to UKIP. The Lib Dems are getting slaughtered in the polls (they've taken an unfair amount of flak for their part in the coalition and have failed to market themselves as genuinely punching above their weight and moderating Tory insanity) but will probably hold on to a fair few seats if they campaign well. 

UKIP surged in the EU elections and are still staking their claim on traditional Labour and Tory voters. Whether this translates to anything tangible is up for debate. I personally despise UKIP and everything they stand for (especially the claptrap that Farage, their leader, is somehow not part of the establishment) but some people love them to bits.

In 2006, Chelsea were after a new striker to spearhead their team in a push for the Champions League. Mourinho had a target in mind. Fernando Torres of Atletico Madrid was widely viewed as one of the best young players in Europe. He'd scored a large number of goals for Atleti and become their youngest ever captian. He was who Jose wanted.

Abramovich, on the other hand, had a different target in mind. He was keen on signing Andry Shevchenko from AC Milan. Roman was extremely keen on the striker, partly due to shared Slavic routes, but he was also undoubtedly a good striker. Chelsea's Chief Executive at the time, Peter Kenyon, was also extremely keen on Shevchenko, and strongly advised Roman to opt for the Ukrainian. 

Roman sided with Kenyon and decided to purchase Shevchenko for £30million, an astronomical, club-record fee at the time. In overruling Jose, Abramovich had triggered the first crack in the relationship between himself and his manager. Mourinho had brought an unprecedented level of success to Chelsea, but by 2007 he was gone, his relationship with the board having become untenable. Shevchenko had been a poor signing, contributing little to Jose's team. He also acted as Abramovich's 'man' inside the dressing room, reporting all back to his friend, the owner. This undermined Mourinho. Shevchenko, apart from the odd moment [(This cracker vs. Tottenham &lt;3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpfpMAs7v9g), was a failure at Chelsea.

Torres, in contrast, moved to Liverpool in 2007, quickly establishing himself as one of the world's best strikers. 

In 2011, when Chelsea needed a new striker, Abramovich became fixated on signing Torres. He was determined to right the wrongs of the past and sign the man he should have signed back in 2006. This obsession over signing him clouded his judgement, failing to acknowledge the drop in the Spaniard's form since his injury at the 2010 World Cup. We signed Torres for £50million on January Transfer Deadline 2011 and we all know that he certainly failed to deliver for such a huge fee, to put it mildly.

Spending £50million on the guy meant that we had to stick with him. This persistence saw us miss out on Falcao in summer 2011 (AVB really wanted him), who moved to Atletico from Porto and became arguably the best striker in European football. Inside our own squad, Sturridge was never allowed a leading role, this was unthinkable given the amount we had spent on Torres. He left for Liverpool and is proving himself to be a world-class centre forward. 

Finally, this summer, Torres has left Chelsea. He won major competitions and left us with the odd moments that we will treasure forever (e.g. Nou Camp, Amsterdam) but he was undoubtedly a shadow of the player he used to be. I hope Torres recovers some of his form in Milan, he always worked tremendously hard for Chelsea and deserves some personal success. 

It also brings closure to the story for Abramovich. He learnt huge lessons from the whole saga. We now have a superb club setup, the best in the league, whereby Michael Emenalo and Mourinho collaborate on securing first-team players. This was in evidence this summer. Gone are the days of Abramovich personally stepping-in to sign players whom he likes the look of. He now understands the value of Mourinho and the importance of harmony within the club. This for me is the legacy of the 'Fernando Torres Odyssey'.

I imagine, based on the current tensions over multiculturalism, that such a Britain would be inward looking, and there would be less freedom of speech than today in order to avoid inflaming community tensions. (See Singapore for an example). While such a country may still be wealthy, it would certainly not be equal, seeing as people are less likely to share their wealth (e.g paying taxes for benefits) to people they do not identify with. 

While in the rest of the world there would be large and unified nation states looking out for their own interests - something that for most of the last few hundred years has actually been a huge advantage that Britain held.

This could be avoided IF the different ethnicities of Britain integrate effectively, but given the community-based structure of current on-the-ground multiculturalism in Britain, together with continuing large scale immigration, I don't think this is especially likely.

I don't honestly care whether you think I'm wrong to label that 'rape camp' or not.  The point is that it's an abomination and the perpetrators were almost entirely Pakistani Muslims.

Do Muslims rape more than others?  

Yes!  

It's not easy to get the figures for Muslim men, but I think it's perfectly credible that there is statistically higher incidence of rape among Muslims than the background population.  Do you want to challenge me on that?  

Crucially, I *don't* think that's anything innate to the men themselves.  I am not for one nanosecond claiming that Pakistanis have a racial make-up which makes them more predisposed to rape.  Rather, I think it's credibly due to their religion/culture.

It seems that the ethnic profile for white and asian male sex offenders is roughly proportionate to their % of the population, the outlier is black men, who make up about twice their proportion in the general population. However, when it comes to 'street grooming', asian men do make up a disproportionately high % of cases (around 1/4 of offenders (where 1/3 have ethnicity down as 'unknown' - so 1/3 to 1/2 of those where the ethnicity is known.)

[Here is the comparison of EU state](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/File:Unemployment_rates,_seasonally_adjusted,_July_2014.png) unemployment rates. They're harmonized and seasonally adjusted. Only 5 states have a lower unemployment rate than us. 

Our unemployment rate is only a percentage point or so above the unemployment rate during the previous decade and is well below the rate it was running at over the 80's and 90's. [\(source\)](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/unemployment-rate)

For the economically active participation, you can, [here,](http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=LFS_SEXAGE_I_R#) see we're near the top and stay near the top of OECD countries. You need to play around with the data though. I've created an imgur link to an illustrative sample [here](http://imgur.com/c4NDtY6) since I couldn't work out how to create a static link to a table. The UK is marked with the large green dots. 

For the dependency ratio stuff, I'd think it would be self-evident. Most immigrants are working age. Most immigrants are employed. Most immigrants are positive contributors to the budget. There's no proof that they're 'taking our jobs', which is possible since the economy is not a zero-sum thing.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;No one wants to move to a country and isolate themselves from civic life. No one. 

People do want to do exactly that, and there are many examples of it all over the country. It is not controversial to say that there are many communities in this country which are made up of almost entirely first and second generation immigrants. Where every child in the local school is from an immigrant family, that speaks a foreign language at home. Where everyone in that community speaks a foreign language day to day and almost never in English with one another, including everyone who works on the local high street. 

To say with such certainty that no one wants to isolate themselves like that shows a complete lack of awareness of what is happening in many parts of this country. 

&gt;British people who want to treat them like outsiders, lowly scum who have come here to do naught but suck off the teat of the state. In the real world that perception couldn't be further from the truth.

Absolute rubbish. There are huge communities which do not integrate all over this country. Are you really suggesting that all these people are failing to integrate because British people are rude to them? You are living in a fantasy. 

The real reason for this isolation is obvious. People move to this country and want to be around others like them, so they move to an area with a high immigrant population. As more and more move in, they start to set up their own services. If you come from a culture which has a lot of incomparability with British culture, for example some of the more intolerant Islamic societies, then you have even less incentive to integrate, because that would mean giving up part of your culture.

true,HomoPachycephalon,null,null,"I may as well let loose my half-formed ideas here: I think that Missy is [Clara](http://i.imgur.com/bIQSzlS.gif).

I'm not really sure where to begin...

I guess the first thing I'll say is that I definitely think that the people taken to heaven/paradise are going to be a sort of jury of the Doctor.

When I first read the idea it felt right to me and after over-analysing and over-thinking the episodes I'm sure of it because of Missy's brooch: http://i.imgur.com/CVLZxZX.png

I think the figure displayed on Missy's brooch is [Demeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter), the Greek goddess of the harvest, the [giver of food](http://i.imgur.com/wtBhXE8.jpg). Demeter is also ""Law-Bringer,"" as a mark of the civilized existence of agricultural society and she presided also over the sacred law, and the cycle of life and death.

For me that's the icing on the cake that Missy is forming a jury (or maybe not so much a jury as a peanut gallery to put forward a case for and against the Doctor) and will judge the Doctor.

So now I guess I'd better move on to why I think Missy is Clara, as I said these are all half-formed...

Missy and Clara are presented as two separate characters, with the Greek mythology Demeter's ""daughter"" Persephone could be seen Demeter's own younger self.

Next there's the boyfriend conversations. The Doctor saying, ""I'm not your boyfriend"" to Clara is in stark contrast to Missy talking about her boyfriend in reference to the Doctor. However if Missy is an *older* version of Clara then the two statements are not incompatible at all. Honestly if we take the idea that Missy and Clara are the same person then these conversations would be a clever way to throw people off the scent. You start to speculate that they're the same person but dismiss the idea without looking at it too much because you remember these conversations and upfront they seem incompatible.

In one of their conversations Vastra asks Clara, ""Are you judging him?"" Turns out the answer is yes. In fact the Doctor invites her to judge him, he wanted her to tell him whether he was a good man and she doesn't really answer (I don't know, you're trying though and that's the point). Anyway, who better to judge him than, ""the person who knows him best in all the universe.""

We see Missy is mucking around with an umbrella when first go to Heaven, Clara needed an umbrella to get up to the heavens (ie the clouds where the Tardis was parked).

*""ZOMG! That's definitely it... but what about their different eyes?""* I hear you ask (or at least imagine it). Obviously Clara somehow regenerated at some point in a spectacular fashion after retaining a lot of fluid as alluded to the Doctor asking if she regenerated, the moment Missy has her arms outstretched in a very regeneration-y pose and Strax making reference to her spectacular fluid retention later on (which you thought was a reference to pregnancy).

*""You've completely lost the plot. What about Missy's reaction to the Doctor's accent?""* Well that's... Um... You're ruining my confirmation bias here. I think I may have been spending too much time on /r/asoiaf 

**TL;DR** Missy is Clara because of confirmation bias.

In for a penny, in for a pound. More half-formed ideas...

I think there's going to be a bit of a theme of [Stoic vs Aristotelian](http://people.wku.edu/jan.garrett/stoa/twoethix.htm) ethical philosophies. Clara's only pinup was a famous stoic and the Journey Blue's ship was the Aristotle.

Danny Pink is a maths teacher, Clara is an english teacher. In the TARDIS there's a blackboard with formulas written on it as well as loads of bookshelves, maths &amp; english. Possibly the maths and english represent the different ethical schools of thought.

&gt;

&gt;In [ancient Greek religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Greece) and [myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology), __Demeter__ (/diˈmiːtər/; [Attic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_Greek): Δημήτηρ *Dēmḗtēr*; [Doric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doric_Greek): Δαμάτηρ *Dāmā́tēr*) is the goddess of the harvest, who presided over [grains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain) and the [fertility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_(soil\)) of the earth. Her cult titles include Sito (Σιτώ), ""she of the Grain"",  as the giver of food or grain  and [Thesmophoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesmophoria) (θεσμός, *thesmos*: divine order, unwritten law; ""phoros"": bringer, bearer), ""Law-Bringer,"" as a mark of the civilized existence of agricultural society. 

&gt;Though Demeter is often described simply as the goddess of the harvest, she presided also over the [sacred law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_law), and the cycle of [life and death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy). She and her daughter [Persephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone) were the central figures of the [Eleusinian Mysteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusinian_Mysteries) that predated the [Olympian pantheon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympian_pantheon). In the [Linear B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B) [Mycenean Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenean_Greek) tablets of circa 1400–1200 BC found at [Pylos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pylos), the ""two mistresses and the king"" may be related with Demeter, Persephone and [Poseidon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poseidon).   Her [Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_mythology) equivalent is [Ceres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(mythology\)).

Like others have said, it's a long season. The biggest difference to get used to is the practice of relegation. All of your points matter, but it's not like where you have 12 games in CFB and if you lose one, you're definitely not going to the championship game (not sure how it will all work out this year with the new confangled set up). Despite all of the points mattering, the long season does give you some leeway. It's kind of like a 5k vs. a marathon. You can't afford one mistake in the first, but in the latter, you're allowed to mess up here and there and still make it out okay.

That being said, I'm not comfortable seeing us so far down the table, but I will say with confidence that my friend who is a chicken-on-a-basketball fan is gloating far far too soon by making his Facebook profile picture one of the table with Tottenham on top. So much can happen, and arguably the second half of the season matters more than the first. I give you full permission to start worrying come January if we're still near the bottom of the table.

*edit: to also answer the other part of the question, and perhaps the main point, I don't think we look horrible. We have played, at points, some brilliant football - much more exciting than sit-back-and-defend from the later Moyes days (I can't speak for the earlier ones). It has been terribly fun to watch them attack as they have, but it is frustrating to see us making some really rookie mistakes, especially on the defensive end.

It is very hard to apply enough moisturiser to get the required protection. Paula's Choice make a great sunscreen for oily skin. However, SPF is more of an investment for the future than something to make changes now. Since you have oily, acne prone skin, a great place to start would be clay masks once a week (reducing oil, REN Clarimatteor Una Brennan are examples) and a salicylic acid product daily to help prevent blemishes (Bravura London 2% BHA is a good choice), wait thirty minutes before applying anything to allow the acid to do its job. Spots should be spot treated with sulphur or benzoyl peroxide (available on prescription, very effective for many). From there, you could add in an AHA (Avene Cleanance K, Nip + Fab, Bravura London) are good options AND/OR an antioxidant product to help even skintone and fade residual marks from blemishes. Patch test products before properly using them (to see if it breaks out/irritates your skin), and introduce products one at a time to your routine (so that you know the culprit if something breaks you out!).


You can't suggest products that won't break you out - everyone's skin reacts to products differently. Nothing wrong with baby wipes if you are cleansing after.

There's enough land south of Luton Airport for two long runways. Luton sits on the Midlands Mainline, which terminates at St. Pancras. Thameslink already has four services per hour between Luton Airport Parkway and St. Pancras International.

The route for HS2 will run about 25 miles away at Aylesbury, so a relatively short line could connect Luton to HS2. This carries the benefit of improving access to HS2 for North London and a number of towns besides Luton.

Rather than involving another stop on HS2, a number of trains could take a route into London via Luton and then the Midlands Mainline or East Coast Mainline (this would require a slightly longer line), and end up at Kings Cross or St Pancras rather than Euston.

Euston/St. Pancras/Kings Cross is on the planned route for CrossRail 2.

I doubt we'll see another outfield player like him in a long while unless Eriksen or Lamela suddenly explode with potential. We look to Eriksen today to be the pass completing creative playmaker (unless your name is Sherwood, then you look to Bentaleb). While Eriksen is doing OK, he's only about half the player Luka was. Luka would rarely miss a pass, he would find passes through opposing players you couldn't see or even thought possible. Watching Luka get the ball always brought a sense of excitement to me. You know the feeling you get when a player gets into a 1on1 chance with the keeper? That's the feeling Luka gave me almost every time he got the ball, something I rarely find in our current players. Eriksen is better than Luka at taking free kicks though.

Maybe Tom Carroll can take Luka's place eventually, but I fear that Tom's progression is slowing down. I always got the feeling seeing Tom play that there was an air of Luka about him, but now I rarely see him play since he's loaned out so much.

Rafa had moments of brilliance, but couldn't last more than 60 minutes per game until his performance started to drop due to exhaustion. That being said, I own a second hand Rafa shirt. He was a solid free kick taker but could also link up with the striker and score goals. He worked hard during the 60 minutes he played, but I'd always worry that it would be like having 10 men on the pitch on the off chance he wouldn't get subbed out in a game.

Berbatov was before my time, really. Seen some touches of brilliance on YouTube. Can't remember if he did well at Manchester United, think he did OK.

Gallas? Well, he's the odd one out of these four, IMO. I'll compare him to a slightly faster Kaboul against Liverpool, you can surely figure it out from there.

Good news is that I have the same issues, so I'll share what's worked for me.

Finding the right *cleanser* was the very best thing I could have done for my skin. Cut my oiliness down by half, and that was an oil cleanser. It doesn't have to take any longer than a baby wipe. Few drops of oil on your face and you wash/wipe off. You can diy it with [baby oil,](http://www.boots.com/en/Johnsons-Baby-First-Touch-Oil-200ml_1487558/) or buy an oil cleanser that has an emulsifier so it'll wash off easy. I like L'oreal's but there are other kinds. 

If you like simple, you might want to try their soothing toner. It has [all sorts of good stuff in it](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2f06i1/simple_soothing_toner/). Niacinamide is the main good ingredient in there, but if you're really into wipes, [Superdrug have a facial wipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddictionUK/comments/2dv7qn/xpost_from_rskincareaddiction_hi_there_skincare/) that includes it.

&gt;In a later comment you mention whether Muslim men rape more than others, is that do they rape more than Christian men, or other religious groupings?

I don't have the figures showing a breakdown by religion, but my hunch would be that Muslim men probably are more heavily involved in grooming gangs (percentage wise) than Christians and I suspect that sex crimes in general would be more prevalent.

I'm an atheist, not a Christian, so I don't really have an axe to grind here.  Be assured that if I thought that e.g. Catholic men were proportionately more involved in rapes then I'd have no problem criticizing Catholics.  

Anyway, I think there *are* problems with attitudes to sex in Islam and although I *don't* have the statistics I'd like, it seems to me that Rotherham is quite compelling evidence that something has gone badly wrong with at least part of British Islam.

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"Watch Sterling and how he glides past challenges if you want to see how much Sturridge avoids physical duels. He is far stronger and bigger than Sterling, but a little touch and he falls forward on his knees when Sterling uses his back and protects the ball from ever being challenged. Not saying Sturridge has to take beating, but I feel he has been so injury prone he doesn't want to risk anything whereas Sterling still is still a bit naive in trying to stay up as long as possible and Suarez was made of steel.


Also watch Suarez and Sterling videos, their movements are short and fast, Sturridge will flick the ball 2 yards and then go for it with all his power, Suarez nutmegs will never expose him to injury because he bets on rebounds or moves to the side when Sturridge moves past defender he exposes his legs  to be clipped. Different styles but I have said this multiple times before, Sturridges ball protection and tackles are a level or two bellow Suarez and Sterling. They use their body to win space then steal the ball whereas Sturridge falls down at slight push, just watch what Balotelli did with Kaboul for comparison.


He needs to grab the defenders shirt and not rely on 1v1 speed race, use his shoulders, push the defender away and then go for the ball. Look back at what Suarez does to Clichy for Sterlings goal last season, he protects the ball and in turn pushes away clichy before passes into open space. I don't know when Sterling realized it, but Sturridge needs to watch him and Balo to see that big defenders can also be bullied ala Torres vs Vidic so many years ago. If he makes that a part of his game then he will become far more dangerous when he is being marked. Look at how Suarez always turns his mark, not with pace but with small pushes and using his back/shoulder, in those situations Sterling is nimble enough to catch the ball and face the defender in one motion, but Sturridge unless he has space to run into will kick it 3 yards at an angle away from goal and then try to adjust. Defenders won't chase him, but he also loses the opportunity to make it 1v1.",0,1409796964,null,0,false,0,ck8llvc,t3_2fe0ar,t1_ck8llvc,t1_ck8gx4y,null,1427207019,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"Academy players should always be kept up to a point, and I'm afraid Suso is past that point. He is too good to be loaned around, but not good enough to play for us. He shows couple of glimpses of his true potential, but he really should have worked better at Almeria with his pressing. If he had been better tackler and presser he could have gotten a chance in midfield 3 of diamond, but Allen/Coutinho/Hendo and probably Can are all better than him at those things. I feel the poor guy got screwed when he was developing as he focused and mastered long passing and dribbling in small space when our current focus seems to be pace and through balls. Shelvey never made it here due to his pace and pressing, even if he was wonderful passer, had great shot and could find forwards with through balls. Coutinho learned it in couple of months and now slots in easily, but unless Suso has transformation like that and is willing to become CM that presses and passes rather than AM that scored he won't make it here. 


I really hope these 4 months force him to reinvent himself and fit into our system, but he needs to accept his current level isn't good enough and be willing to change like Hendo and Coutinho. I feel for him when he was brought up as attacking midfielder and he worked hard on his free kicks and long shots and now he has to become physical. Maybe in couple of years he can play in Gerrards role where long passes will be useful.


Either way if he goes to Milan he will have to change, his current level isn't great, couple of goals cutting in from left isn't enough for clubs who want to win trophies, and it's easier working towards his pressing and short passes rather than improving his creativity to Coutinho or in his case Silva level.

true,liamdpt,EN,england,"He will not play Mata as a wing back, he doesn't contribute anything defensively and that's why we sold him. Amazing player but poor work rate and if you're playing wing backs you need work rate. A fully fit United team will probably be:

De Gea; Shaw, Rojo, Evans, Jones, di Maria; Blind, Herrera; Rooney; RVP, Falcao

I wouldn't be surprised to see him switch formation, I still don't understand why he's playing a 5-3-2 and can't see how it will work for them now. Di Maria will be wasted at wing back and even though I think he's a better CM than winger, I can't see him starting there with new signings Herrera and Blind to along with the pre-existing Carrick, Fellaini and Fletcher. I doubt Blind was bought to play LB after they paid £30m for Shaw, Shaw is more than likely their first choice left back with Rojo and Blind being available to play there if they need to, like now for example. I'm not really sure if Rojo is naturally a CB or LB but he's definitely no worse than Evans, Jones and Smalling at CB. You would think with only having 4 CB's it wouldn't really be a good idea to play 3 at once week in week out, especially when they're all fairly injury prone.

I would play a 4-2-3-1 with De Gea; Shaw, Rojo, Jones, Rafael; Blind, Herrera; Mata, Rooney, di Maria; Falcao

I don't think you need Falcao and RVP in the same team, they're fairly similar strikers and it's hard to pick between them especially considering Falcao has just come back from a serious injury and RVP was injured for a lot of last season.

Honestly, United have some really scary players but they just aren't a scary team any more. Mata isn't the same Mata he was at Chelsea and hasn't been played in his favoured position until this season but like I said that could now change with Falcao being introduced. Rooney is captain and won't be dropped and LVG often favours dutch player so I can't see him dropping RVP which means Mata will be dropped anyway. Again, for me di Maria is at his best when playing CM but they have a lot of options in the center including two new signings and not a lot of options at right wing back(good options at least).

My opinion:  It's absolutely true that men are more likely to commit violence and I suspect we're also far more likely to commit sexual violence.  But, individual men have no special responsibility whatsoever for the behavior of others of their sex.  Men should speak out against rape to the extent that *everyone* should speak out.

So, why the apparent double standard?  Why do I think that it's OK to criticize Islam and not men in general?

Because being born male is not a choice any more than skin color.  Because being male is not the same as choosing  a religious ideology.

So why are men more likely than women to engage in sexual violence?  

I think it's likely because of biological reasons.   (That doesn't mean I think it's acceptable or that we can't do anything to lower it!)

I don't think that men have collectively decided to punish women or that there exists a 'rape culture' conspiracy amongst men to excuse acts of rape.  

But if you think that male rape is due to culture, then you will have to explain why we see men disproportionately use sexual violence agains women in every human society which has ever existed.  Does the whole of humanity share the same culture?  Is it a male-wide plot throughout the whole of human history?

OK then, what about 'gay bashing'?  Again, I think men should speak out against it for the reason that *everyone* should speak out.  Is it a mostly male problem?  I'm honestly not sure, but it wouldn't surprise me.  I really don't know much about homosexual persecution or the reasons behind it and I haven't read any intellectual discussion which I trust on the subject.  

Edit:  I think I should add that one possible cause for homosexual persecution is because of religion.  One more reason to become an atheist!",0,1409798941,null,0,1409799731,0,ck8mhqd,t3_2fdm2l,t1_ck8mhqd,t1_ck8lz5x,null,1427206537,-9,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-9

I found a DonationWare program called TemporalityScreens ([Download](https://www.donationcoder.com/CodingSnacks/files/TemporalityScreens/TemporalityScreens.zip) | [Site](https://www.donationcoder.com/CodingSnacks/index.php)). You put the wallpapers in a folder, copy one of the .thm files into it, open the .thm file in notepad, and change the wallpaper names. I chose the hourly.thm since it was the closest to what we want. Then, run the program and it lets you load a .thm file and afterward sits in the system tray doing its thing. You can always right-click the system tray icon to change things, too.  Unfortunately, it sets the wallpaper as centered, so you'll need to resize them to fit your resolution.

I have no idea if this works on Windows 8, by the way. I'm on 7 and so far, so good. EDIT EDIT: Ugh. It sets it as Center, which for my display settings makes it WAY too big. I resized the images to match, and things look like they will work. Will update next hour.

Original post follows:

Okay, I have been hammering at this this evening with my novice scripting abilities and I have one that works for me.

I put the images in a Wallpaper folder I keep on my desktop where I put cool images I find on Reddit that would be great wallpapers. I created a ""Doctors"" subfolder and saved the images as 1.jpg through 12.jpg.  Then I made the following script:

    dim shell
    dim hourofday
    dim refreshloop
    hourofday = hour(now())
    if hourofday &gt; 12 then
        hourofday = hourofday - 12
    end if
    Set shell = WScript.CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"")
    wallpaper = ""%userprofile%\Desktop\Wallpapers\Doctors\"" &amp; hourofday &amp; "".jpg""
    shell.RegWrite ""HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\Wallpaper"", wallpaper
    shell.RegWrite ""HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\WallpaperStyle"", 2
    shell.RegWrite ""HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\TileWallpaper"", 0
    for refreshloop = 0 to 5
        WScript.Sleep(1000)
        shell.Run ""%windir%\System32\RUNDLL32.EXE user32.dll,UpdatePerUserSystemParameters"", 1, True
    next

Some of you who code are probably going, ""Woah, woah, woah, that is a lot of system parameter updates. Are all those necessary?""

Yes. Yes they are. I tried a flat 10 second delay, and found that it often did not trigger. I finally got mad at it and just set it to repeat and found that it was fairly reliable.

I named mine TimeLord.vbs and set a scheduled task to run daily at 12 AM and every hour thereafter, and to run it if the scheduled task is missed (that way on system wake up it should set the correct wallpaper). If you decide to put your 1-12.jpg images in a different directory, then make sure to modify the ""wallpaper="" line with the correct path.

Hope this helps!",0,1409798959,null,0,1409977200,0,ck8mi1h,t3_2fby1g,t1_ck8mi1h,t1_ck87pcc,null,1427206534,13,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,13

3) Race and immigration carry a different tone/weight in the US. How much does fear of IS/Jihad play a roll in these issues? Would a significant portion of voters consider these fears unfounded?

4) Every time I've watched a speech by Cameron, he seems like a standup guy. What does the general population think of his government?

5) Why is privatization of care a big no-no?

true,harlequinity,WA,wales,"Lets start by unpicking the squad a bit...

Immune from the drop:

Rooney (captain)
Falcao (big money signing 1)
Di Maria (big money signing 2)
Robin van Persie (Dutch captain under LVG)

The stand out fact here is that there are 3 strikers. How to accomodate them all? The only way to do this is for Rooney to play in behind them as a number 10.

So straight off the bat United would appear to line up:

       RVP      Falcao
           Rooney

Lets look at formations. They have started with a 3-4-1-2 but with such a wealth of talent attacking wise and mediocre CBs beyond Jones and Rojo, it would take an incompetent manager to stick with in. Especially in light of recent results - add to this QPRs failed experiment and maybe LVG may clock on to the fact 3 at the back isn't cut out for the premier league.

Flicking back to the original list, we need to accomodate Di Maria. Where? Although playing RW for a lot of his career, he never shone like he did at CM and united lack quality CMs so boom, CM it is.

To add some defensive grit to this star studded team, I would opt for Blind in midfield. This also frees up LB for another acquisition in the form of Shaw. He will be the player to sit in front of the back four and turnover the ball and recycle possession to the wealth of talent. 

So where next? The back 5 appears to sort itself out with 4 head and shoulders above the rest quality wise (IMO of course).

    Shaw  Rojo  Jones  Rafael
            De Gea

This leaves one space in the team. Which is where my beloved Mata comes in. He becomes a (very attacking) option along with Herrera, Fellaini, Fletcher and Carrick if United choose to play a 4-3-3, or, my personal choice, a perfect, David silva esque, option in a 4-2-2-2 a la Man City.

City have famed this formation recently, but I feel united could out play them at there own game.

Here is my line up:

          RVP       Falcao

      Rooney            Mata   

         Di Maria  
                  Blind

    Shaw   Rojo    Jones   Rafael 
              
              De Gea

This puts Mata and Rooney a bit wider but allows both to cut in on there stronger foot and thread through balls through as well as pick up some goals themselves. Rooney also has an excellent work rate and would be more than able to drop in and defend the CM position when Di Maria inevitably bursts forward. Mean while Blind sits there soley defending. Di Maria gets a free license. Rafael is a passionate player and will work hard all day getting forward and back. Shaw will be able to pick out Falcao with some pinpoint crosses, both are the types of players to provide width.

On the bench, Fletcher and Fellaini will provide physicality and the ability to shut out games, Herrera becomes a utility player and can cover Di Maria and spread passes or sit further up in Mata or Rooney's positions. Valencia can act like Navas does for city and add pace and width. Januzaj can come on in place of Rooney or Mata and provide that creativity. Evans adds depth at CB.

For me Mata is of higher quality then all bar (and all of these are debatable IMO) RVP, Rooney, Falcao and Di Maria and thus deserves to start. I have outlined the most feasible way for this to happen. Let me know what you think!

Probably, if they want it. 

&gt;Also, do you think they would eventually want to reintegrate with the UK?

Entirely up to them. It's their choice, after all- but I don't expect it'll happen anytime in the foreseeable future, if they decide to go. It's rather a final step- the only thing I could imagine pushing them to try it within the next few decades would be complete economic collapse on their part, and a bizarrely accepting political culture on our side. It's one thing to be happy enough for them to go if they choose to do so, but actively choosing to reintegrate them down the line would be a fair bit more difficult.

&gt;Would this set a precedent for a referendum in N. Ireland?

Jesus Christ, no. 

The overriding priority in Northern Ireland's to avoid rocking the boat at all costs. The place *does not need* that kind of incendiary measure right now- it's only been twenty-odd years since the place was a powder keg.

It'd be a push as to whether they'd even want to join the Republic right now, as well- Ireland's economy's in a complete state, after the past couple of years. ",0,1409801128,null,0,false,0,ck8nfdz,t3_2fcx8y,t1_ck8nfdz,t1_ck8n24h,null,1427206101,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2

If you took Bamford into the squad, you could realistically have him be fourth choice, behind Costa, Remy, and Schurrle (he's a plenty good third 9 in my opinion).

Not everybody chooses their ideology. People are born into families with a long history of a particular belief or way of living. In the case of Islam, it shows how deeply culturally embedded the religion can be that some people who make arguments like yourself treat 'Muslims' as one homogenous group when they most certainly are not.

It may be a more light-hearted example, but I'm an Everton fan because my dad was. My dad chose to be one. So while something like that can be a choice, it isn't always.

&gt; I don't think that men have collectively decided to punish women or that there exists a 'rape culture' conspiracy amongst men to excuse acts of rape.

Look at the recent scandal of celebrity image leaks. Obviously looking at the pictures isn't tantamount to rape, but nonetheless there are plenty of people making excuses as to why it's okay that the right to privacy of these people can be completely thrown aside. It's like a vignette of what rape culture is.

&gt; The implications of this are that as soon as it's left the depot, it's in the hands of some random person who can do with the package as they will.

The entire London courier industry - not to mention all nationwide same-day deliveries - operates on this basis. 

The BBC, your bank, and temple chambers barristers all entrust important, sensitive, private documents to ""some random guy with a van"" if that's the way you want to characterise things, but using self-employed drivers isn't really that much different from using employees. 

The difference between Yodel and the company that transports valuable documents is how much shit everyone gets in if a package is lost, and the culture of care that exists throughout the company, from management all the way down to the drivers.

I've fucked up deliveries for multinational companies that brought to my employer millions in annual revenue - the difference is that it was a rare genuine misjudgement, that steps were taken to ensure that it didn't happen again and that the client were reassured of our professionalism. If it was the result of carelessness I wouldn't have been allowed to stay in the job.

true,XlPoLaR04,num23,,"Well I think what gained from those, i see more positionally than anything. Such as our full backs, Walker, Rose, and soon to be Yedlin have all played on the wing at one point in their career, and would probably be considered better going forward than defending. This is an directly due to the issues explained in #10, and i would say Walker when fully healthy is one of the best in the Prem at it. To a larger extent the reverse of Rose happened to Bale. He was so bad at defending yet showed so much Promise in attack that he ended up being a $100m+ winger. 

Next I see a lot coming out of#9 together with #4 (Versatile Attackers and Off the Ball movement) with our current front 4 especially with Soldado or Kane up front. We play with such a free flowing dynamic system that where Lamela Eriksen and Chadli start is hardly where they end up making plays. Against QPR Chadli if i remember correctly scored both goals from the right side of the pitch and Lamela got his assist from the left. It usually ends up with Eriksen or Lamela tracking out to get the ball and another one of the three filling the gap. With Soldado and Kane in the mix this adds one more element because they stray out of the box to help with build up. Unlike Ade who is most at home holding up play until he can get back up front. 

That intrinsically moves into #6 and #2. We hardly field players that played the same role as someone would have 15 years ago. All of our strikers provide something aside from just finishing, and sometimes the other things they provide can overcome poor finishing and keep them in the squad... I'm looking at you Bobby..... Kane has been played as a 10 before and provides as much build up help as Soldado does. Ade does it completely differently with his focus on hold up play that is so important to our play when he is in the squad. Funnily enough we were at the start of this movement with Jermain Defoe, being the pacey finisher he was in his prime. As far as the classic #10 dying we used to have one, however he never got played in his original position due to being just that a classic #10 and not fitting when we need someone more well rounded. Of course I'm talking about Siggy, he was an out and out playmaker... It just so happened that we had 2 more complete players that were also playmakers ahead of him at his time at the club, Bale and Eriksen. Bale obviously was a playmaker, a goal scorer, a winger, and sometimes even a defender. Eriksen, however is a little more tricky to describe, I think it more comes down to the fact that he hardly ever stays down his line in the center of the field and is on the flank all of the time. Don't get me wrong he is very close to what we had from the #10s of old. I think it really is just him, Wes Sneijder, and James Rodriguez as far as tip top players that get close to being a Trequartista, however the playstyle now is just a bit different than it used to be. So I don't think we will ever see a player with the style like Totti or Rui Costa or Bergkamp dominate like they once used to. 

So yea that's what i see in Spurs as far as new tactics and the way we play, hope you liked it.

Having 3 CBs and 2 wingbacks really reduces the amount of attackers you can put on the pitch, assuming you want your wingbacks to play like actual wingbacks and not wingers. Because then players like Di Maria, Janauzaj, etc, are really wasted out there.

For me I can't see him leaving Mata out of the team solely because he is their most creative player. Him and Di Maria are the only midfielders that have sparks in them. A lot of people have been talking about Mata's work rates and I have to say, he is not a CM, he is an attacker, best played right behind the forwards where he can be a playmaker. I wouldn't say he has poor defensive workrates purely because he isn't supposed really have any defensive duties. The same way I wouldn't expect Terry or Cahill to be charging out from the back I wouldn't expect Mata to be tracking back across the field. Its also a physical thing as well, like many other CAMs Mata is pretty tiny and I can't see him shoving anyone off the ball.

**First** create a PowerShell (.ps1) script that contains the following code while replacing %picture directory% with the actual path to the folder containing the album.

    #Getting the hour in the correct format..
    $a = (get-date -UFormat ""%I"")
    IF ($a -gt 12) { $b = ($a - 12) }
    else { $b = $a }
    
    #Path to your wallpaper folder..
    $myPictureFolder = ""%picture directory%""
    
    
    # doing DIR on a Picture folder and choosing the one based on the current hour
    $Wallpaper = Get-ChildItem -Recurse $myPictureFolder |where {$_.name -like ""$b -*.jpg""}
    
    # Setting wallpaper to the regisrty.
    Set-ItemProperty -path 'HKCU:\Control Panel\Desktop\' -name wallpaper -value $Wallpaper.FullName  
    
    # updating the user settings
    rundll32.exe user32.dll, UpdatePerUserSystemParameters 
    rundll32.exe user32.dll, UpdatePerUserSystemParameters 
    rundll32.exe user32.dll, UpdatePerUserSystemParameters 
    
    # end of the script


**Second** create a VBS (.vbs) script that contains the following code while replacing %PowerShell script path% with the actual path of the PowerShell script. In this case you can't have any spaces in the scripts path.

    command = ""powershell.exe -nologo -command %PowerShell script path%""
    set shell = CreateObject(""WScript.Shell"")
    shell.Run command,0

Then all you need to do is create a scheduled task to run daily that calls this script. 

Create a new task and for the action you will run the program ""wscript.exe"" and for the arguments add the path for your .vbs script. After creating this ""daily"" task open triggers and edit the Daily trigger. You can then edit it to run every hour. This will find the image that correlates with the current hour and change it. It does not rely on any 3rd party software or triggering the wallpaper change on the hour.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"Rose is better this year, but I still think he's a liability.  He doesn't have a great positional sense, which makes us extremely vulnerable down the left flank, particularly if we don't have a proper LM/LW who pitches in on defending, or at least beating back the opposition fullback.

His touch can be pretty sketchy, and his idea of running with the ball is to play kick-n-chase.  I feel like he doesn't really know when to pass and when to dribble the ball, which leads to many bad choices and loss of possession.  He seems fairly panicky as a passer, as he often just hits the ball whenever he's put under pressure and closed down, without really knowing how to use his body to protect the ball or work clever triangles to retain it.

Finally, I don't really feel he adds much in attack either.  Aside from a couple of wonder goals, he doesn't score much, nor assist much.  His deliveries into the box frequently aren't good enough.

He's not the worst player in the world, but he's nowhere near top 4 quality, which is ideally what we need every player on the pitch to be capable of.

Davies, whilst not spectacular, I feel doesn't make the same basic mistakes as Rose, and positions himself more conservatively in order to protect our left flank.  When he does venture forward, it's rarer but generally with more purpose.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"We live in a Constitutional Monarchy, and ""The Crown"" often simply means ""the Government"".

This is because after we have an election, we do a little bit of make-believe. Whoever wins the election has to go to see the Queen in person, and request that he be allowed to form ""Her Majesty's Government"". The Queen graciously accepts, and that person then becomes Prime Minister. The reason I call all this ""make-believe"" is because although theoretically the Queen could refuse the request, any monarch who did so would cause such a political crisis that they'd find the country had suddenly become a republic within a few days.

So as far as the law is concerned, the government only exists because the Queen has allowed it to exist, and therefore any action the government takes is officially done in the name of the Queen. More succinctly, it's simply termed ""The Crown"".

In a legal situation, most prosecutions are carried out by a government agency called the Crown Prosecution Service, and again because they -- on paper at least -- act directly in the interests of the monarch, the cases are tried as ""Crown vs XXX [defendant]"". It's also worth pointing out that ""the Crown"" is explicitly *not* the Queen herself.

Odd.

Please inform everyone of the multitude of virtues that Bradford has to offer. Please tell me exactly why I am wrong.

For Christ's sake, one of the other posters had to resort to mentioning a local Chicken and Chips outlet as a *'good place to check out'* because they could think of fuck all else to say about this godforsaken armpit of a town.

The fact that I'm being downvoted for saying the most obvious fucking thing I've probably ever said is a genuine example of how fucking out of touch with reality many people in Bradford are.

Here's the reality for anyone thinking of coming to Bradford. Unless you're from a third world country, the place you're currently in is probably better than this place. If the place you're currently in is *worse* than Bradford, then god help you.

Bradford is one of the poorest and most dangerous cities in the UK. Check out Wikipedia, don't judge what I'm saying by the downvotes. Those downvotes are coming from deluded Bradfordian retards whose lack of intelligence and life experience is a fucking embarrassment to the north.

Bradford does have a few decent curry houses, but it doesn't have *any* decent restaurants. Not what people in the 21st century would regard as decent. Most of the old, favourite pubs from my youth have gone. Derelict shells or bookmakers now. There are more decent pubs that have turned to rubble than still exist. By a massive margin.

The nightlife in Bradford *is* non-existent. If anyone tells you any different, then they are people with no frame of reference to compare Bradford to other, better places. Even the University's closest, historical student pub, the Manneville, is now a fucking corner shop for fuck's sake. Can you imagine the 'Eagle and Child' in Oxford becoming a *Nisa* mini market?

The people who live directly outside Bradford avoid the place. They hardly go there, never if possible. A friend of mine, who *is* a southerner, has lived only 4 miles away from Bradford for 15 years now, but has *not once* set foot in Bradford City centre. Seriously, that's how much Bradford has to offer. You can literally live next door to it for 15 years and still not find a single fucking reason to go there. (Unless your preference for shopping is buying your stuff from charity outlets and pound shops, of which there are plenty.)

Bradford is bleak and depressing. It has been dead for a long time, and is in an advanced state of decay.

This is why you have been advised, not by me, but by deluded fuckwits, to spend your time in places like Hebden Bridge, Leeds, Saltaire, and the countryside. You'll notice the one thing these places have in common is that they are not Bradford.

Now, if you doubt my honesty regarding this town, try a little experiment. Go and ask people what Edinburgh or Glasgow is like to live in. Go and ask people what London or Cambridge or York is like as a hometown. I bet you that the people who answer you do not tell you, within only a sentence or two, to go do things somewhere fucking else. The list of virtues of these places would be very long before you were being advised to fuck of to outlying towns, villages and the countryside.

That hasn't exactly been the case here, has it?

So, I'm some kind of fucker for dissing Bradford and being 'cynical', but the people who claim that Bradford is just GRRRRRREAT! are almost immediately advising you to do things away from Bradford. There's a clue to what Bradford is really like hidden in that advice somewhere.

Just look at the comment below. Telling how great Bradford is, then immediately telling you to fuck off somewhere else. Mad. Just fucking mad.


I'm sorry to be so negative before you're arrival here OP. But to try to be more upbeat about this place would be just cruel.

Yes, there's emphasis on the 'modern' fullback attacking, but first and foremost they are defenders, and are on the pitch to prevent the other team scoring. Helping the attack should just be a bonus, and is for most fullbacks. Baines was arguably the best left back in the Prem the season before last, because he knew when to defend and when to attack. However, Rose is essentially a failed winger, and thus has no ingrained impulse to think ""I should probably just mark my man"".

Whether or not he was ever truly fated to die as he had not yet experienced Trenzalore is a moot point because his new regeneration cycle effectively took in place of his death. In the universe's eye Eleven still experienced his own timeline and still effectively died on Trenzalore so the space-time scar incident is allowed to exist as a past occurrence in the Doctor's life but since he regenerated it is no longer present in the universe.We hear the Great Intelligence say the he is angry at the Doctor for defeating him many times so we can likely assumes that he is accounting for every television appearance (and possibly extended universe/audio stories as well since it is open ended) before he steps into the timeline. This means that he attacks the Doctor from within his timeline at different points than when he physically met him in the show. So Clara only removes the new incidences from the Doctor's timeline not the other preestablished encounters. So even if Clara could have gone to the future incarnations, she did not erase any event that occurred before the Great Intelligence stepped into the timeline. So he may be dead for good but still encounter the Doctor.The Great Intelligence is said to have died the moment he entered the timeline but that is assuming he sent all of himself into the timeline.

As the population grew this became more impractical as more cases were waiting to be heard, so the monarch appointed local nobles to be their representatives in jurisprudence cases - the monarch granted the nobles the monarch's powers for the purposes of justice so everything was done in the name of the monarch.

When the modern system of magistrates and judges (different jobs) was set up, the power of these individuals still stemmed from the monarch, even if they weren't appointed by them directly.

They used sciencey sounding ideas to push a purely emotive agenda. You can agree with the emotive agenda, and i do as it happens. But you know that it DOES work right? 

The cull didn't fail, they failed to cull. The problem was that they didnt hire enough people or get the right people or whatever, to effectively kill enough. The principle that killing large numbers in the densest disease areas will lower the overall disease rate is under no doubt,  we know that works because other countries do that, like Ireland which has a similar geography to us and the target region. We know that no coubtry has ever reduced bovine TB without large scale culling of the primary vector.

I'm against the cull because killing one species so that we can keep and kill another one at artificially high levels because eating plants is beneath us is ridiculous.

true,screamingaddabs,null,null,"OK, I'll bite.  Assuming you are genuine (I'll give the benefit of the doubt) here are some answers.  As a disclaimer, I am mainly left of centre in my views, though I have tried to present facts as much as possible rather than opinions.  I guarantee someone will disagree massively with what I say, but that's politics I guess.

1) First Past the Post encourages tactical voting.  A proportional system would change this but some argue it has its own problems.

2) The people who don't like Thatcher really don't like her!  Whilst I don't agree with every point I'm about to make (though some are smack on - I'm not a fan) here are the reasons people hate her:

- Closed the working class industries in the North and offered little to no help in finding further jobs

- Made the economy far more London-centric and focussed on the finance industry

- Introduced a flat rate tax (the poll tax) in Scotland as a trial, especially awful as Scotland very rarely votes Tory so most people being hit by this non-progressive policy didn't vote for her

- She epitomised the right wing ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" view of the world

- There are more reasons [here](http://squarepenguin.co.uk/why-margaret-thatcher-is-hated/)

3) Hard to say, but I would suspect that although it plays a role, most (but far from all) people in the country are not afraid of Jihadist groups.

4) *Personal opinion alert* He's a lying duplicitous twat who will say anything to get elected!  Aside from that (and being a bit less immature about it) his approval is quite low (around 30% I think) and many in the country see him as another posh Eton boy who thinks he has a divine right to be in power.  Others of course like him, and he presents himself well on the world stage (generally).  He is well educated and speaks well.

5) It's a nono for SOME things.  NHS being the obvious one.  There is not so much hatred of socialism in the UK for a start, so nationalisation isn't seen as terrible.  For things like the NHS (and the trains - a recent poll found the majority of the population wants them renationalised, and to an extent the power industry) the idea is that they are meant to provide a service to the public and are things that have a natural monopoly.  As such, it is in the public interest to have their success measured not on profit (as it would be in private hands) but by customer satisfaction essentially.  The natural monopoly also means that competition cannot work properly to drive down prices for private options.  Finally, the big one for the NHS is that it MUST BE FREE AT THE POINT OF USE.  Of course privatisation doesn't necessarily mean that that wouldn't be the case, but people don't like money being brought into something that you have such little control over.

6) There are some parallels with the tea party.  UKIP are seen as either an anti-establishment breath of fresh air or a group of ""swivel eyed loons"" that can't tell their arse from their elbow.  The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.  They are very unlikely to get into government (for the same reason as the greens) but may get a couple of MPs.  Their main effect is to drive the tories to the right to try to retain votes, hence driving policy their way without actually being in power.",0,1409817866,null,0,false,0,ck8saiw,t3_2fe3fp,t1_ck8saiw,t1_ck8mtbu,null,1427203760,4,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,4

What's wrong with asserting that he needs to address an obvious weakness in order to go up a level? Sturridge needs to start to bully defenders and play through the pain more, he gets very isolated when alone up front in games vs the likes of City.


Point me to a world-class number 9 in the premier league over the past few years who doesn't have the mean streak that Sturridge lacks. 


Drogba? You don't bully Drogba. Full stop.

Shearer? See above, with bonus elbows.

Henry? Not just a pacy striker, he could mix it up. Same with Bergkamp, he had a touch of evil and wasn't frightened to leave a foot in.

Torres? Repeatedly tore Vidic a new one, picked a fight with John Terry in his second game, bullied Carragher in training.


van Persie? Same with Bergkamp, he can be a nasty bastard.

Aguero? Kick him to pieces, he'll still score. Capable of some truly nasty stuff when the ref has his back turned.

Suarez? His rap sheet needs no introduction. Kicks, bites, headbutts, pulls hair, tackles late and hard, throws in an elbow now and then, allegedly racially abused Evra. Would probably behead an opponent on the pitch if he thought he could get away with it. Relentless in his work rate and cuntishenss.

Islam says that alcohol, drugs, rape and abuse are all forbidden, yet these men were surrounded by all of these things. So how can anyone say that these men were driven by their religion to do this kind of thing?

Well, actually I can.

I think that religion causes a mistrust of outsiders, which sometimes becomes contempt.  Under the right conditions it can even be a factor in rape and murder.

Am I absolutely 100% certain that religion was a factor in Rotherham?  No, but I think it's plausible and I think that we'd be fools not to consider this as a serious possibility.

I don't mind if you disagree with me, but I do think we should be allowed to debate this issue.

-----------------
I submitted this article, because I also want to talk about how the Guardian seems to have closed off discussion about Rotherham.  They have featured article after article defending Islam and Muslims, whilst featuring little coverage of the *victim's* opinions.

Is there a danger that people will use Rotherham to promote bigotry?  Yes!  Absolutely.  But what I've seen out of the Guardian this past week is little more than propaganda.  Only one side is shown.  There was an article yesterday in which Rotherham residents were interviewed.  Great!  But, they only interviewed Muslim residents.  

As part of their role as a left-wing paper, The Guardian is meant to be 'guarding' the concerns of working class people (of all races).  That includes the working class white girls who were the victims in Rotherham and their families.  It's true that their opinions are unlikely to be politically correct at this point in time, but I think they also deserve a voice.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Well I'm saying it's pointless to treat Islam purely as the problem in itself. Why have a separate drug for one form of an illness and another for another form when both can be treated with one drug as the same illness.

I'm sorry, but by the definition of mental illness, religion *is* a serious mental illness that needs treatment. Here's what wikipedia has to say:

&gt;A mental disorder, also called a mental illness or psychiatric disorder, is a mental or behavioral pattern or anomaly that causes either suffering or an impaired ability to function in ordinary life (disability), and which is not developmentally or socially normative.

So lets analyse this in regards to religion. ""[S]uffering or an impaired ability to function in ordinary life"", well the second part can definitely apply here. Religion *does* cause an impaired ability to function in everyday life. I mean on an extreme scale if you are going around believing people have to die for not agreeing with you or not wearing the right things, *That* is a serious impairment. But that is an extreme case. Lets go back a bit. If go around believing that you must wear special adornments and items in fear of negative effects from some invisible being, that is a form of impairment. If you believe others must adapt their appearance lest you are driven to do something, *that* is a form of impairment. If you believe certain couples should be discriminated against, hidden away or even killed, *that* is a form of impairment. It's even entered political and public life. If you dedicate vast amounts of time opposing something that objectively causes no harm to anyone because you believe a supernatural force will harm you and others, *that* is impairment. We have people all over the world trying to pass laws that either make it harder or impossible to access or practice birth control. This is objectively harmful to others and society as a whole. Why are these people doing it? Because ""God"" wants it.

It's sometimes horrifying how accepted religion is, despite it being what can be described as a mental illness. It's a mental illness that's not only encouraged but actively ingrained in society. I don't hate religious people, I can't hate the mentally ill. I want to help them. Religion has an illness has gotten so out of hand that it plays a part in influencing our laws, and how on earth can that be seen as OK?

Instead of treating Islam as separate from everything else, lets treat all religion as a problem.

Everton always start like shit, doesn't concern me in the least. If it goes to Christmas then I will get a bit tetchy, but the international break and one of the least tricky away games of the season should be a decent platform to get the wheels in motion. 

There are people saying we have already thrown away 4th and what not, but that is bollocks. We have shown we have the ability to beat any side in the league, both with our first half against Arsenal, and our consistent performances last year. It is going to be tough, but there is still a great season ahead of us. 

The key in this league is to keep improving each year, never slipping up- and we have certainly done that in spades over the summer. We have young players who will keep getting better and better (Barkley, Stones, Lukaku), we have players on the verge of breaking out of the youth sides into the main squad (Ledson, Garbutt, Lundstram) and we are in a position to buy in players now, which we did a great job of in the close season. 

The board and management need to take a lot of flak for our poor start. Our pre-season was an absolute mess, with no energy and passion, only 1 game at home, an utterly pointless trip to Thailand and no real organisation of squads- and it shows on the pitch now. 

If we can click sooner rather than later, there is no reason why we can't him 70 points again with our improved side (even if others are also improved)- and to do that twice in a row and not get CL football would be so unlucky.

It's a pity that they think we were underpaid for Suarez but I do have to agree with them. You can label him as a ""problem"" player but his commitment and work rate are better than anyone.

I've never seen him sulk or slack off during a game, which is something that could be said of both Ronaldo and Messi at times (especially at international level). Look at Suarez against England in the World Cup. Returning from KNEE surgery (which is some serious stuff) for a full 90 minutes, 2 chances and 2 great goals (the second one especially).

You can't coach that attitude into someone, and one thing Suarez can't be called is a lazy egotist. I really think he's the most valuable player in the world right now.",0,1409823652,null,0,false,0,ck8t9vw,t3_2ff4k2,t1_ck8t9vw,t3_2ff4k2,null,1427203302,4,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,4

I only found this out when I was walking back from the pub with him and the *""don't be shy, give it a try""* guy asked him for his hoodie out of the blue, and he laughed and admitted he would probably have to.

Come the end of the festival he's been asked twice a day for two solid weeks for his jumper, and quite a few people know the story. He accepts his fate, leaves the pub and goes down to offer him his jumper.

The word 'prioritising' in this context, to me anyway, suggests they'll get round to investigating a crime eventually. This evidently is not the case.

&gt;I go out with front line officers on a fairly regular basis and the idea that police simply ignore criminal damage, vehicle theft and 'minor' offences is wrong.

Anecdotally, I've had my car window smashed twice in the past few months in a car park that has CCTV.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; Cycling lanes are for anybody who wants to use them.

So are roads, provided you have a license for your vehicle or ride a bike. Bikes get to use roads for free of course (or rather at no additional charge). 

Cycling lanes however should not be used by: cars, pedestrians, HGV’s, motorbikes, roller-skates, skate boarders, hovercraft, pogo sticks, 747 jets…. 

In other words they can *only* be used by cyclists and so it is only cyclists that benefit from them. 

Cycling being cheap has nothing to do with this – it’s incidental. Its negative (and positive) effects are also irrelevant. 

The infrastructure will still need to be built – will still cost money – and will be beneficial only to people who use it. 

As I said, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect the cost of something beneficial to (a group) to be passed on to (a group) in this instance.

I do however appreciate that no cyclist will openly say ‘sure, I’ll pay for this thing that benefits me’ – people want things, they don’t want to pay for them.

A couple of cup games isn't going to cut it, he needs a game every week and he's not going to get it here. If Brendan felt he was good enough he'd be throwing him into the team now.

I like Suso, I've seen him play for the first team in person twice and was impressed both times, but to be honest, I think that people have built him up too much. Think of young players like Gotze, Pogba, El Shaarawy, Oscar, Eriksen, Isco, Neymar and Sterling (even though he's younger) when they were at Suso's age, and you can't compare. If he had the world class potential a lot of people are saying he has, he would be showing it now, but he isn't. That's not to say he can become a good player, but developing late and becoming as good as any of those players is looking highly unlikely.

true,thebigeazy,null,null,"&gt;Cycling lanes however should not be used by: cars, pedestrians, HGV’s, motorbikes, roller-skates, skate boarders, hovercraft, pogo sticks, 747 jets….

Yes, but my point is that cycling is a form of transport with minute barriers to entry. Cars, HGVs, motorbikes etc have costly barriers to entry, and are expensive to fuel. Cycling has mass appeal. So whilst it's true that cycle lanes are only for cyclists, it's also true that just about anybody can be a cyclist. 

You also have to consider that cycle lanes (and those who use them) bring a swathe of benefits to society. Less congestion, less pollution, improved public health, etc. 

&gt;Cycling being cheap has nothing to do with this – it’s incidental. Its negative (and positive) effects are also irrelevant.

How can they be irrelevant when we're discussing costs? Mass cycling is of huge benefit to a country, but mass motoring clearly is not (don't confuse this with things like freight, obviously that's a bonus)

Therefore it makes plenty of sense for the government to invest in mass cycling and other forms of sustainable transport.

&gt;I do however appreciate that no cyclist will openly say ‘sure, I’ll pay for this thing that benefits me’ – people want things, they don’t want to pay for them.

The same way that no motorist will say they want to pay for a motorway.
Because people already pay for these things through taxation. 

The dutch and danish and others have a great model for how to enable mass cycling, and they are reaping the benefits.

1. Quite simply, we don't have the housing available. Before we can take any more people there needs to be a post WW2 level of housing building. At the moment more people are coming in then houses being built, and what is being built is largely by private builders, and unaffordable to those who really need it (young families starting out instead not boomers moving cash around or foreign investors).

2. We need to spread out migrants more and not have them creating localized ghettos like we have now.

true,dageshi,Plus,,"Winter is coming and the time remaining for hour plus smokes is rapidly depleting. As someone who's spent the summer sampling a wide variety of singles this meant it was time to start buying boxes of something small, inexpensive but with hopefully a lot of flavour to last me through the winter.

Websites were consulted, reviews carefully balanced, opinions of guru's taken into consideration and eventually after I'd thoroughly confused myself with the massive amount of choice on offer I said fuck it and bought a box of 25 Por Larranaga Panetelas.

And I learned a valuable lesson. 
 

In the mind of a man accustomed to smoking singles, each cigar is like a special event, to be savoured and consumed sparingly because you've only got one. On the otherhand a box of 25... of the same cigar... that may as well be the same as having *infinite* cigars. All semblance of restraint is thrown out the window when one has *25 cigars*.

What I should have done and would typically do is put them in the humidor and let them settle down for a few weeks. But in my newfound madness what I *actually* did was grab one and smoke it immediately. And that was a mistake, the draw was too tight, there were hints at interesting flavours but they were completely overwhelmed by the sheer roughness of the smoke. Perplexed and a bit dejected I thought maybe I'd just had a bad one, so the next day I grabbed another and... the same. At that point I was just going to sling them in the bottom of the humidor and hope they'd be better in a few years.

Well that was until a few days ago. The skies cleared and it was a beautiful windless day, right I thought time for a cigar. So I decided to pull out a Por Larranaga again and give it another try... what a difference!

**Review Time**

**Name:** Por Larranaga Panetela (37 x 127mm)

**Description:** Short filler hand rolled Cuban

**Box Code:** PUM Jul 13

**Appearance:** Not the prettist but at this price point that really doesn't matter.

**Construction:** Draw was fine, on the windless day I smoked one with zero touch ups required, yesterday it was a bit windier and I had to make some corrections after the ash dropped. But generally it was fine.

**Flavour:** Wow what a difference! After lighting it got into its stride pretty quickly after a few puffs flavour was coming through thick and fast. My initial impressions were of a delicious leather followed up by some coffee, that mix really held on for the first third. Second third some sweetness came into the mix, other reviewers have picked out toffee in this cigar and I could definitely see that in the second third. Final third was really a mix of the above.

**Final Verdict:** They say that if you can smoke a cigar and then be ready for another straight after then it's a good cigar. I'd quite happily smoke a couple of these back to back, they're excellent little cigars for the money.

**Rating:** 89

I suspected that tired career drivers normally have a reason for why they became so tired. It could be just that they stayed up late at the pub, but in this case it seems like he was being way over-worked by his firm.

Considering the state of the labour market, I wouldn't expect he has much choice in the matter if he wants to keep his job. So why is all our ire and punishments directed at him, and none at the firm that over-worked him to the point that he killed two cyclists?

true,potentialhijabi1,eng-yorkshire,God's own land,"Let's address each of your points in turn shall we? Also, for the record, Islam is NOT a race- it's made up of hundreds, if not thousands, of different ethnic and tribal identities. 

* **people running off to join insurgencies**: Not a problem which is exclusively Islamic, and in any case the heads of several prominent Islamic organisations, including Al Azhar University in Cairo, the Islamic equivalent of Oxbridge, have made statements denouncing both extremism and IS. Even the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia has issued a statement! I'll see if I can find the full list someone published on /r/islam. 

* **journalists being beheaded**: Where in the Qur'an does it say 'thou shalt behead a journalist'? 

* **FGM** This is a practice which is largely confined to African countries (making it a racial issue, not a religious one), and one which was practiced long before Islam. There is no Qur'anic injunction to do this procedure, and there exist Christian and traditional religious groups who also practice it. 

* **Taking over state schools**: Firstly, I notice how you single out Islamic groups in this. There exist numerous examples where Christian evangelicals tried to push religious agendas into academy schools, and there exist in London and other places unofficial ultra-Orthodox schools where creationism, strict segregation of boys and girls, corporal punishment and no teaching of non-religious subjects are all the norm, and the schools themselves are packed into small, often unsafe buildings where things like fire regulations or safety are of secondary concern. If you're going to target one religion, it is only fair you treat them all with the same treatment. 

* **honour killings**: Again not a specifically Islamic practice given there are examples of Hindu and Sikh killings. Nor does the Qur'an specifically mandate it, but rather preaches something of the opposite ([Here's a good PDF article from an Islamic site on the subject](http://islamawareness.net/HonourKilling/honour_killings.pdf))

* **turning towns into rape camps**: Seriously?! Not going to touch this one with a 10ft miswak. But I suggest you get your head out of the Daily Mail for 5min and take a trip to Middlesbrough where I live to see the Muslim community here, who've lived here for over a century without problems. 

* **Issuing death threats over books** If this is a coded reference to Salman Rushdie, then it is worth pointing out that after the fatwa (which is really only a religious opinion, not binding dogma) was issued, 44 other Islamic scholars voted the fatwa to be unIslamic. But idiots like you seem to fall,over themselves to shout about one scholar shouting his mouth off and to ignore those 44 because it suits. 

* **rampant anti-Semitism**: Again not a specific Qur'anic mandate, and rather it is a complex issue of religion, politiics and history. 

  Plus I would have to point out that anti-Semitism was for centuries a fundamental part of European culture. Jews were at one time forbidden from certain types of work, sometimes forced to wear specific clothing or identifying marks, were forbidden from public offices, were denounced as 'Christ-killers' by the Catholic Church (something which has only recently been dropped by the Church as official dogma) and subjected to enquiries, imprisonments, persecutions, torture, kidnappings of Jewish children to make them Catholic and even banishment from Europe for several centuries. The Western world cannot, especially given that Jewish persecution exists even in our recent history, then begin finger-pointing  at the Islamic world, which for centuries was a haven for Jewish people fleeing persecution.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; You also have to consider that cycle lanes (and those who use them) bring a swathe of benefits to society. Less congestion, less pollution, improved public health, etc. 

They do - but they still cost money. No matter how great cycling might be - it's still going to need paying for. 

I'm not trying to be short sighted here - but assuming that everyone can / should / will cycle is optimistic. It's not ""the final solution"" - it's a hope. There's still a plethora of times that a car or heavy goods vehicle is going to be mandatory for whatever trip. 

I'm all for increasing cycling infrastructure - not that my city will see any of this investment because I don't live in London - but £913 million is a lot of money. Better hope that it's worth it. 

&gt; but mass motoring clearly is not (don't confuse this with things like freight, obviously that's a bonus)

It is a bonus - and yet it's not - everything that uses roads is all one and the same. They all have to have the appropriate taxes, insurance and so on and they all use the same infrastructure (with the occassional exception of bus lanes). 

It's convenient to your arguement to break them down - but the roads won't be going anywhere any time soon no matter how much we push cycling and *still* there's that £913m cost that has to come from somewhere (and *won't* have the bonus of HGV's being able to use it etc. - it'll be for individual or tandem cyclsts only and exclusively). 

&gt; The same way that no motorist will say they want to pay for a motorway. Because people already pay for these things through taxation. 

But as I've already established a motorway will benefit a great many more people for a larger variety of applications. Coaches / HGV's and everything else (including emergency services) all benefit from the same roads. 

And again as I've already established a cycle lane will be used by a much more focused transport group - which is fine - but passing it off as a national asset is a stretch. ",0,1409828374,null,0,false,0,ck8u4lt,t3_2fcpz6,t1_ck8u4lt,t1_ck8tzmu,null,1427202904,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

On a purely paper basis this makes vague sense for freeing up space to bring in the English players we need and to ensure the squad is not left in the problem it was this season when one of the HG players leaves slightly unexpectedly.

They're useful squad members that makes them expendable, I guess if the article means we should have got rid of them at all costs that's silly. If the article means we should have accepted all sensible bids. I'm inclined to agree. Yes Ramires gives us some dynamism when need (also a fouls count and an ability to just get stuck somewhere with the ball lacking the ability to pass it or go round the player). Not sure what Mikel gives us other than something any other similar player could do. Or indeed players we already have as they mention.

From a squad analysis point of view a lot of the points make sense. Financially it probably doesn't, they don't take account of the fact that there isn't a market for most of these players and as they're not holding us back as such there's no reason to make a loss on their value. Cech and possibly Ramires being the exception. Although Ancelotti probably wanted Ramires if Khedira was going to leave I'm not sure the board really cared what he wanted anyway. 

If we're talking about positive things for the youth of the club Ramires and Mikel would have been good, not on a par with the Ronaldinho ousting a la Pep style but similar in reason and hopeful for development.

Basically, I think pro-independence people are getting too carried away with what I call ""clean-slateism"". Essentially, starting over again is always appealing. You work on any project for long enough and you'll get to a stage where you go ""Oh, it would have been good if a while back when I was doing X I did Y instead, maybe I should start over"". We strive for perfection and feel frustration when things work in an inefficient or clumbsy manner. You get emotional about it and you just want to start over. You convince yourself you can rebuild things exactly as you want. If the project is collaborative (as is a government) you get delusional and think that this time round you'll get everything you wanted.

Though, for anyone who's been in this situation, you realize this is a really bad way to run things. You forget that between the things that annoy you are systems in place for the things you like. You forget that even elements that you hated are there for reasons and these reasons need new solutions; solutions that may not be that much better than what you replaced. The reality eventually hits that you have to negotate with all the shareholders of the project. You try to get what you want again but you hit the same hurdle you've always hit- you're still the minority with your views, even in this new environment.

In short, one of my chief argument for the union is that it may not be perfect but it is a system of government that has evolved very gradually since the the days of Cromwell. It's never been a great government but it's also never been a terrible one. We think it's too conservative and won't change but it does. It just does so over a very long peroid of time. The more I observe the world the more I believe that gradual tinkering trumps sudden revolution. Revolutions are dangerous business. They sometimes work but more often than not, they don't. I think a vote for yes is akin to a vote for revolution. A completely new way of doing things, a big black unknown. I wouldn't want to risk so much good (and there is a lot of good in our current system) to get rid of a few ugly bits.

So what?  Crucifixion wasn't a problem which was exclusively Roman.  Gassing people wasn't exclusively Nazi.  Does that change the moral calculus?

&gt;Where in the Qur'an does it say 'thou shalt behead a journalist'?

[Beheading is an Islamic practice.](http://www.orthodoxislam.org/beheading-in-islam.html)

&gt;The legal evidence of beheading in Islam is the hadith narrated by Ali ra which states no capital punishment except by the sword. This is hadith is graded acceptable by Sheikh Turkmani in his book Aljawharat AlNaqi. Scholars however disagreed that whether beheading by sword is the only way for capital punishment or not but it is one of the ways. Islam however does not permit slaughter as it is too much a suffering and the minimum amount of suffering in capital punishment is sought. The evidence is the verse ""No extremity in killing should be done (Fala Usrif fil Qatl)""

Salman Rushdie:

&gt; 44 other Islamic scholars voted the fatwa to be unIslamic.

Right.  Tell that to Salman Rushdie. 


So, basically, your main feeble excuse is that other people have done bad things do.  Rape, beheading, death threats and so on are not exclusive to Islam, therefore you can't blame Islam.

true,thebigeazy,null,null,"&gt;They do - but they still cost money. No matter how great cycling might be - it's still going to need paying for.

Yes, it does need paying for, but thankfully the finances of a country are run long-term, and anyone involved should hopefully realise that investing in cycling represents excellent value for money. Paying  a billion quid for cycling infrastructure is much smarter than paying the same amount into... the House of Lords, for example. The former brings massive benefits for everyone in society, and not just those who actively cycle, but those who do not.


&gt;I'm not trying to be short sighted here - but assuming that everyone can / should / will cycle is optimistic. It's not ""the final solution"" - it's a hope. There's still a plethora of times that a car or heavy goods vehicle is going to be mandatory for whatever trip.

We've had this discussion before, so I'll direct you to my comment that you ignored last time - 

http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2d7wh5/chris_boardman_says_its_ridiculous_that_the/cjni77u

Average modal share in the UK is 2% at the moment. No reason that can't grow to at least 20%. No reason at all beyond laziness and a lack of political will. Tons of reasons why that's a desirable outcome for cyclists and everyone else, too.

&gt;It is a bonus - and yet it's not - everything that uses roads is all one and the same. They all have to have the appropriate taxes, insurance and so on and they all use the same infrastructure (with the occassional exception of bus lanes).

No, that's not how transport planning works. It works on the prioritisation and recognition of the importance of certain modes of transport. That's why we have bus lanes and loading zones for freight. Single occupancy motorcar journeys are lowest on that scale, yet they represent the majority of traffic. They contribute least, and holistically, do the most damage. The government and society should be doing everything they can to ensure that a lot (not all, but a lot) of those journeys are changed to sustainable transport choices such as public transport or active travel. Look at Basel for example, in Switzerland. 20% of journeys by bike, 20% by foot, and something like 30% by public transport. No reason a lot of urban areas in the UK can't emulate that.

&gt;But as I've already established a motorway will benefit a great many more people for a larger variety of applications. Coaches / HGV's and everything else (including emergency services) all benefit from the same roads.

We already have quite a large road network though. Cycling infrastructure in the UK is woeful.

&gt;And again as I've already established a cycle lane will be used by a much more focused transport group - which is fine - but passing it off as a national asset is a stretch.

It is a national asset because of the mass appeal and positive externalities - to a range of road users -  of cycling.",0,1409829358,null,0,false,0,ck8uc1u,t3_2fcpz6,t1_ck8uc1u,t1_ck8u4lt,null,1427202808,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,WhaleMeatFantasy,null,null,"Well there are 12 district/borough councils in Essex so you're looking at ~3,300 children per council if your stats are correct. If you can review 4 children an hour, that's 830 hours work. 40 hour week gives you ~21 weeks work.

Now we need to remember that there will be a very large number of siblings included. [A majority of families](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/fertility-analysis/cohort-fertility--england-and-wales/2010/only-kids-sum.html) have more than one child. So that further reduces the amount of time needed by at least a quarter so &lt;16 weeks' work.

But would it really take 15 minutes to check each family? Of course not. What is there to check? Eligibility is based on the receipt of any of a number of credits like JSA. So all that needs to happen is for applications to be checked against the database of people who do. This should be fully automated. Even if not, it's a quick job.

So even if I'm wrong and the checking would happen at the county council rather than local council level, it should require little to no effort other than for forms with missing information etc.

If this is a dedicated role then every council in the country will have one; perhaps you could find a job description for it?

EDIT Should add that this is clearly seasonal work, too. It's far more likely that there would be a meal-checking season with lots of workers roped in when necessary.",0,1409829922,null,0,1409832239,0,ck8ught,t3_2f966m,t1_ck8ught,t1_ck8u2w4,null,1427202750,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

And why not target both? 

I thought it had been established for some time that tax avoidance and big business financial crime massively dwarfed welfare related fraud. Absolutely we (and *I* mean the appropriate government branches ) should go after the big fish. Definitely. Without a doubt. 

But they should also spend some time on benefit fraud. It’s not OK. “Someone else is doing something worse” is not a mitigating argument. It’s still illegal. 

This article sounds a bit like ‘let’s forget the shop-lifters when someone is stealing jewellery’ – yes one is worse than the other but there’s no good reason not to take both seriously. 

Perhaps it’s a self-reflective article for the media to stop persecuting the poor and running sensationalist stories on them – and instead put more pressure on big brand tax evaders to name them, shame them and encourage change. 

But people do love reading about the evil man down the road who stole £10,000 in false disability claims…

That makes no sense, youd take in criminals from developed nations but not highly educated forward thinking individuals from un-developed nations?

&gt; I'd personally like to see a kind of developed union, where people from those pretty much the OECD can travel and work freely.

Urm, we are part of something known as the EU. The EU commits large investments into making other countries move towards democracy, human rights and freedom of expression.

Any EU citizen can also travel and work freely in any other EU country. The new countries such as Romania acknowledge they have problems (as does any country) but by joining the EU they have committed themselves to the path of western values.

That is one of the main factors for countries to join the EU, as well as being part of the biggest economic bloc on the planet, they want to become developed and better themselves as a country.

Why you dont know this baffles me.

&gt; People from developed countries have the same basic upbringings...respect elders, authority, study hard and clime ladders blah blah blah.

This is just plain bullshit. Afghani children respect their elders climb ladders and study hard. Same as Chinese and Mexican children. Others are indoctrinated into militant Islam or authoritarian autocracy. Why not take people on an individual basis rather than generalisations? The UK makes a hell of a lot of money from allowing rich parents from un-developed nations sending their kids to UK universities to learn.

&gt; I might be stereotyping...but hey...what the hell is a stereotype...it's a noticeable generalisation...if you're going to talk mass figures...yes, then I'm going to generalise because picking people out on individual merit is a bit hard.

This is where our fundamental differences lay. I am all for taking people on an individual basis even from undeveloped countries, but you would be happy to let anybody in as long as their country is ""developed"".

I genuinely find BAE really entertaining and when we had 'Arry for those few years BAE was a fantastic player for us. I remember thinking 2 years ago ""if he could just get back to that level"" we would be all set at LB.

But once he started picking up those nagging issues with his knees you could see that he just wasn't the same player. I had hoped that i was wrong when we sent him to QPR and he would find his form under 'Arry....but he didn't. Since he was playing in the Championship few people saw him regularly (i know i saw him play 2 times and relied on a couple QPR season ticket holders i know to keep me up to date on his performance) i think people just thought of the old Benny and how he played when in fact that version of BAE is no longer the player that is there.

Throw in his off the field attitude and it became clear that he wasn't part of the plans.

However in the first two games there was no connection between them, Skrtel headed to the penalty box while Lovren pushed out and big gaps formed both across the pitch and down it.

Lovren and Sakho at least were on the same wavelength in terms of where they wanted to hold the line. We even stepped out and caught players offside!! As the writer says Lovren looks like he's trying too hard to take charge and he made a couple of poor judgements, at the moment he looks a combination of his excellent play at southampton and his poor final year at Lyon.

We tried the police, and despite it happening at 0215-0220 without fail they were unable to respond. When they did show up (during the middle of the week...) the most action we got from the police was an officer ranting at us demanding to know what the fuck we expected him to do about our problem and a warning that we could be prosecuted if we tried run the guy down ourselves. When we contacted the police chief about the problem, the best she could do was to have car in the vicinity.

What could the police have done? The simple solution would be to have an officer standing just around the corner waiting to grab the guy. What did they do?

Cromer has a castle?.....Are you thinking of Castle Acre maybe?


Anyway....Norfolk....

Yarmouth is rough and run down. Its a pretty depressing place, apparently its a bit like Black Pool (never been). But its not without merit...you cant accuse it of having no character, put it like that. Norwich is more or less lovely, historical like Cambridge, and Oxford with plenty to see and do.

Dotted all over Norfolk we have some quite nice, small, picturesque towns... You cant go to far wrong with those.

Cromer and Sherringham are very nice Victorian sea side towns, and Cromer has its pier.

Other than you you have some nice windmills dotted over the place. Herringfleet mill is nice and remote enough that no one visits it. And Thurne mill is very pretty with a nice pub just around the corner.

We have some cracking beaches in general. Wells Next Sea/Holkham beach are pretty perfect (always winning awards).

When people complain about people getting benefits they shouldn't be getting, they're not talking specifically about fraud. They're talking about people who have no intention of ever working (or of ever working full time), receiving benefits that provide them with a better quality of life than many people who do work full time and have to pay their own way in life.

To be frank, does this even affect you? How much money are you going to be banking with them? If you're anything like the vast, vast majority of people in this country it will essentially be zero pounds. Even if you hold a couple of thousand in your account on a regular basis, it's still peanuts to them. So to some extent, if you really don't like HSBC and you regularly pay out as much as you pay in, you should bank with them. It will cost them money to administer your account and they won't make any money from it; you'll be a permanent drain on their finances.

If on the other hand you are bringing a significant amount of money with you, you should be investing it anyway rather than letting it sit in a current account.

true,pianoboe,StJohns,St John's,"What's up. I'm happy to help (and sorry if this is too late), especially since as you point up there's a big problem with no rooms having comments.

Hot showers aren't a problem so don't worry about that - all cripps ones have been done up and have solid water pressure, and chapel and north have nice bathrooms. Don't expect luxury, but they're pretty nice.

If you want quiet in terms of nobody partying around you, yes it's probably better to pick North or Chapel. Out of the two, chapel rooms are probably quieter since there's no road noise (which some north court rooms have) - and also there's lots of fellows on the staircases so not many people actually in at any one time. You loose out a bit on social in comparison to North perhaps, and definitely in comparison to Cripps. 

Cripps: It's uni - there'll be people partying wherever, and cripps kitchens are perfect for pre drinks and nice social dinners. I lived in B Cripps in my first year, but I've stayed on H and G as well when I've been around in the holidays. If you get the option to choose rooms that are closer to college (A/B/C/D staircases) then it's way more convenient, and A/B/C have a river view. Swans and punters exist, but I'd take the river view over the occasional bit of noise - who knows, you might end up living next to some annoying kid who plays the drums in chapel court and it be a nightmare.

Finally: Cripps smallest rooms are much bigger than the little rooms in North/Chapel  (which are basically a bed with maybe space for a yoga mat in-between that and the desk). Big North/Chapel rooms are big, and big Cripps rooms are HUGE. Everything is new, so don't worry about that. If you have a big room, you'll have more wall space than you'll know what to do with.

Edited to add to your points.

&gt; Not surprising given your understanding of finance probably only extends to the weekends Sudoku puzzle.

No need for the insults (although I do  know my first in economics is worth jack)

&gt;What you need to find is an effective way to tax the top 1% on assets rather than income. Taxing income only really hurts aspirational but 'assetless' people. It is completely ineffective and ruinous for the economy.
The super wealthy don't make their money on income they make it on their assets

It hasn't been for the Nordic countries, so why not here? 64% on money earnt over £1 million a year is not going to hut assetless people -I think they are  doing pretty well at this point. 

However I do agree we need to look at taxing assets as well as looking at offshore investments and dubious tax loopholes.

I'm not all take take take though - I  would also look at incentives for new businesses and those that develop their staff.

Cromer on the other hand and the areas north are lovely. We stayed at Wells next the Sea in an awesome campsite and caught the bus to Cromer and other places, later we stayed in a Cromer B&amp;B when the storms hit last winter and it was awesome :) Surprise star spot in the legendary John Hurt too!

The broads however - frankly it is a very boring area. What anyone sees in those river holidays is completely beyond me. The camp site (Waveney River Center) was cute but cramped, and as I said Lowestoft is a complete hole.

true,I_pity_the_fool,null,null,"I'm sure you know a great deal about economics. You seem however to be a little confused about our taxation system.

Income tax is levied on people who are resident in the UK. People who are resident and also domiciled pay tax on both their British and worldwide incomes. People who are resident here but domiciled elsewhere (including, for some reason I can't quite understand, Lord Ashcroft) pay tax on their british income and on foreign income that they *remit* to the UK (by, say, moving it to a UK bank account or buying an expensive asset with it and moving that to the UK). 

Domicile is also important for inheritance tax. I vaguely recall that it's levied on everyone with UK domicile.

Citizenship, for the purposes of tax law, doesn't really matter very much. This situation contrasts with that in the United States. There, the income of all citizens and of everyone who is a permanent resident is subject to US tax law.

I'm not really sure precisely what you're proposing, but it seems that you want either (a) to end the remittance basis for non-doms resident in the UK or (b) levy UK taxes on everyone with British citizenship. From your comment - and I apologize if this is inaccurate - you appear to have confused the two.

Now, ending non-dom status would only affect people who stay in the UK. It doesn't affect people who move abroad to, say, Bermuda to avoid tax.

You *could* levy your tax on all citizens. You'd make the British system a bit of an outlier internationally with this. Some googling reveals that the US, Israel and North Korea are among the few nations to adopt such a system. As far as I can see there are two problems with this:

* You'd need to have a system of fines to stop wealthy citizens renouncing their citizenship. The US has such a system. It also bars you from re-entering the US if you have a certain $ value in assets when you renounce. You might want to think through the human rights implications of this, particularly Article 8 of the ECHR.

* You might need to get our European partners to cooperate. The treaty of rome guarantees free movement of capital. I don't know a great deal about European law, but I understand that there are rules against penalizing flows of capital from one country to another. I also fear that levying taxes on your citizens working abroad might be considered as interfering with the free movement of workers. I haven't checked this, but my sense is that these issues could probably be resolved to catch most tax exiles. However I'm not certain that people moving to, say, Estonia and, later, to the Bahamas would necessarily be caught by whatever laws were drafted up.

Capitalist ideal? What the fuck are you talking about? Capitalism is an economic model so i dont understand what that has to do with any of this.

&gt; It's widely known that the EU accepted far too many poorer countries 

Accepted by who? UKIP members like you who perpetuate the spread of disinformation in regards to the EU and its benefits?

&gt; and now the more developed ones are struggling...see Germany

Unless you have been living under a rock for the last 4 months, Germany has had to apply very harsh sanctions to Russia (one of its biggest trading partners). That is the main reason Germanys economy has been struggling lately. Before the sanctions it was predicted to grow at a rate of 1.5%.

&gt;  They should bring themselves up to a standard level before they are accepted

WOW, even more disinformation. Where do you get your information from? Do you read tabloid headlines and form opinions based on those? Because that is what it seems like.

Educate yourself for once maybe?

http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/policy/conditions-membership/index_en.htm

**Conditions for membership:**

* Complying with all the EU's standards and rules

* Having the consent of the EU institutions and EU member states

* Having the consent of their citizens – as expressed through approval in their national parliament or by referendum.

**These laws include:** 

* Stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities;

* A functioning market economy and the capacity to cope with competition and market forces in the EU;

* The ability to take on and implement effectively the obligations of membership, including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.

&gt; which clearly hasn't worked.

According to who exactly?  How are you quantifying this? Or did Nigel Farage tell you that so of course it must be true.

&gt; Joining the EU has nothing to do with allowing western values to flourish in the country. The EU is failing and the sooner we leave it, the better.

See above, you are incredibly mis-informed.

&gt; It should be a challenge and a privilege to live in the UK if you weren't born here

It is a privilege to live in the UK for many many immigrants. The few that dont think so should be removed and sent back from whence they came, but as ive said previously this should be done on an individual basis.

&gt; instead of the current supply of fuck it...anyone from the EU can up sticks and move here

It is one of the EUs foundations to allow the free movement of labour between member nations. But as long as the immigrants arent working illegally i dont mind. British citizens still get given more opportunities than those from say Romania, thanks to the UKs education and welfare systems. Fact is its a competitive market, and if you want to be employable/employed then you have to bring something worth paying for. Otherwise the whole economy stagnates. Competition is what drives us as capitalist countries.

&gt; which alone is causing huge problems in the house market.

The housing crises is contributed to by immigration of course but the main factor is **the lack of houses actually being built** in this country and peoples refusal to allow houses to be built near them.

It makes for a happier Scotland in the uk and helps wales and northern Ireland the ability to branch out.

If you really do want to ride a motorbike (and its great fun when the bug gets you), then commuting can be a bit of a faf. I did it for 4 years in all weathers, and at the end of it, I didn't sit on a bike again for 10 years. You'll spend half the time too cold and wet and half the time too hot!

Firstly, I'd recommend getting a second hand commuter, and not a sporty model as its very likely to get nicked. You'll need to get heavy duty locks (I have one that cost over £200) and keep the bike covered up when its not in use. Also maintenance will be a pain as you'll have to do it in the street in all weathers.

Your average morning could be, go down to the street, unlock the bike, take the covers off, take all the stuff upstairs to your flat, get changed, go downstairs, leave... and repeat for evening time.

She is flirty with Danny and Robin Hood because she knows that it is easier to diffuse potential situations by having an ally.

Please bear in mind that the yes campaign suffers from a lot of people similar to the ones you mentioned who can be a turn off because they are rabidly nationalist but there are lots of sensible heads in the campaign too. They offer a vision of Scotland which is tempting - one where lots of things which will be of huge benefit to me are on offer, low childcare, low taxes, cheap or free education. I am just worried as it's all based on things working out *just right* and if they're wrong then I worry what we do then. 

The no campaign suffers from seeming like a negative view, they simply don't show a vision of Scotland which is better than what we have now. They seem to really struggle to point out that history has shown what this country can achieve as part of the Union (all the good things that the yes campaign says is good about us - which are all true) and  to set out a vision of a Scotland where we get the benefits of a United Kingdom *and* are able to decide the important things that really effect our future, like healthcare, taxation and education - all of which are or will be under the Scottish parliament. 

I am leaning towards no, although it wouldn't take much to change my mind but at the moment the yes campaign is unable to show me enough certainty for me to justify a yes vote.

LOL. The EU has almost 0 military power and very little political power. It excels in economic power however, being the biggest economic block. But for some reason thats a bad thing according to you.

Oh i agree, pay in European institutions is too high, but it does attract highly qualified people. Infact there are a number of parties in parliament working towards lowering all officials pay.

&gt; and yet isn't elected by the people

This comes from a fundamental misunderstanding of how the EU even works. There are two institutions, The European Parliament, containing directly elected MEPs, and the European Commision, containing a president who is elected by the biggest party within the European Parliament. **He is elected by elected officials.**

These election results are very different to the UK - in Scotland the SNP has strong support, this support clearly doesn't carry over to the UK General Election and you have to ask yourself why people who think SNP are the best to run their country aren't best for the UK.

The only answer would be that the SNP weren't likely to win, this is obvious to anyone that exercises even the smallest amount of rational thought - a party that only people in Scotland vote for cannot possibly get enough votes to make a difference in the UK elections.

In the UK elections there are two parties you vote for Labour or Conservatives, for the people of Scotland the answer is to vote for Labour to ensure that Conservatives don't get in, it's not about voting for the party you want to win (although many do want Labour/Conservatives to win obviously).",0,1409838687,null,0,false,0,ck8x49n,t3_2fdkze,t1_ck8x49n,t1_ck8w4x2,null,1427201445,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

The current England system was based on name only, he would have thrown it out of the window soon after Euro ended and his experience in lower leagues give him belief in such players. England avoid players from smaller leagues and play a lot of players that aren't committed to the team. With the current team he would play Sturridge as striker in 433 or play Welbeck next to him 4312 with Sterling behind. Lallana will probably be moved to CM for us and him and Hendo will do so well there together.


He is practically dictating part of Englands system by showing the management there how well these players can play. Sterlings move inside, Sturridges growth, Hendos reinvention are all massive credit to him. Hodgson is catching up to big teams by sticking to players they want to push through like Chambers and Stones (Flanno before his injury). Even teams who don't have top starting 11 put in players who are alright and play well in that system, Gerrard and Lampard retiring is blessing in disguise for him. Rodgers moved on Carroll and Adam right away without seeing much of them, it was clear they would never fit the system, we were complaining but now we see how obvious it was. Enland won't win much with this squad, but if they push for a system that can get the best out of Sturridge, Walcott, Sterling, Wilshere, Hendo and then the likes of Barkley, Welbeck, Chambers (who surely needs to be pushed ahead of Jones), Lallana, Shaw they can get a team that will roll over smaller teams with quality like we do.

We would need to improve our infrastructure so that its possible to catch a high speed train from south to the north. We would also need to get some Airlines to fly out of our airports. Cardiff does look like it might be improving a little but its a long way of the destinations available from Bristol.

The NHS is also in need of a LOT of work here in Wales. We already have complete control over how we run the NHS and it doesn't seem to be working.

These are not a valuable use of police time.  You'd be spending significantly more money on officer time than you'd ever hope to recover.  If you want to do those things, that is great.  Maybe you have a lot of time on your hands, or there is an item of particular sentimental value to you, but it's silly to expect police to spend an infinite amount of time on every crime.  They look at the damage caused, the chances of a succesful outcome, and make a decision on how much to investigate based on that.  It would be utterly bloody pointless to do anything else.

true,apr400,null,null,"As I clearly said - this has nothing to do with the past. Forget about everything up to independence. One must assume that in the negotiations for the split, Scotland and rUK will sit down and divvy up all of the assets and debts on a reasonably equitable basis. 

Sure, Scotland won’t get every thing it wants and neither will rUK. But regardless of that, once the negotiations have concluded Scotland would begin as a new country with a clean sheet. It would not be beholden to rUK for anything, but neither would rUK be beholden to Scotland for anything. That is what independence means. 

Obviously I am simplifying – for instance Scotland might buy UK debt going forwards and then we would owe you for that or vice versa, but nonetheless historical accounts would all have to be settled by independence. 

So take such a situation. Scotland owes rUK nothing. rUK owes Scotland nothing. Then introduce a currency union. At this point Scotland is using the pound **AND** has the BOE as lender of last resort. 

A few months/years/decades later and through some unforeseen and unpredictable circumstance – a borrow and spend ScotLab government, a crisis in the American Fannies, whatever, Scotland/the Scottish banking system or some other such thing finds itself in deep trouble - it's bailout or default. (And remember these things do tend to come along every twenty or thirty years) 

The rUK then has the legal obligation to dig Scotland out of the hole (probably whilst digging itself out too – cf last global financial crisis – everyone was thoroughly buggered together) but at the same time Scotland has not been contributing to rUK during the good years, nor will it resume doing so after the downturn ends. Neither will rUK have any right to say anything about Scottish tax or spend. Essentially rUK will underwrite all of Scotland’s sovereign risk and get neither treasure nor control in return. 

Furthermore not only will this not be to rUK’s benefit, but it will not be to Scotland’s either. For instance Scotland will have no control of it’s own base rate. Whilst I am not an economist I can also foresee all sorts of M4 money supply issues – would Scotland, or Scottish banks be allowed to increase M4? If not then bang goes fractional reserve lending and sovereign debt in Scotland. If so, then bang goes any control the BOE might pretend to have over inflation, and any debt raised by Scotland would in reality be raised against rUK.

In practice there are really only four ways forward with this.

1) rUK allows Scotland to have a currency union with nothing in return (other than the intangible of supporting a major trade partner). This puts the rUK at risk that every future Scottish government behaves itself financially and that there are no more financial crises ever. Not surprisingly neither Westminster, nor through polls the people of rUK want this. 

2) rUK allows Scotland to have a currency union but demands political control of taxes and a tax contribution to rUK. In this case what has actually changed on independence – not much. The SNP would not allow this. 

3) Scotland has its own currency, which it can call the pound or the shilling or the Haudyerwheeshtsassenachs or what ever it likes, but as it is not in a currency union with rUK, Scotland doesn’t have to worry about the BOE and rUK doesn’t have to worry about Scotland’s financials.

4) Scotland joins the Euro. See first two sentences of (2).

Of course, it's really bollocks - globalisation has _never_ meant free and open markets, which is why so many on the right freak the fuck out about free movement of labour.  You know that global inequalities would mean _massive_ movements of people towards those places which offered workers the best deal, whereas there is only free movement for the rich, capital and producers in most cases currently, and severe restrictions on the free movement of workers and consumers.  It's a rigged system, and one which has started to come home to roost for unskilled and semi-skilled workers of the West, but will increasingly impact on skilled workers as time goes on.

But why though? The only thing he does is spout shite. The only reason you consider him ""one of the major voices"" is that media outlets keep spreading his bollocks. They've given him credence that he wouldn't otherwise have had.

He wants to goad Nigel Farage into a debate just so he can get more publicity and spread more bollocks to more people.

The media are responsible for getting his views out to the wilder world where impressionable people are hearing them and potentially being guided towards his cause.

At the moment, they are picking fights with just about anyone they can think of.

This strikes me as an incredibly poorly thought-out strategy, and makes me think their leaders aren't the sharpest in the world.

They seem to be a loose coalition of every disenfranchised psychopath who happens to be a Muslim, yet they don't really seem to care about Islam at all. Most of their crimes are sins in the eyes of their own religion, and every other Islam group in the world is rapidly distancing themselves from them.

So, what would happen if we carved out a small piece of desert, and told them they could have it as a Caliphate? They might be good at riding around in trucks toting AK-47's, but I suspect they couldn't organise a piss up in a brewery, let alone the infrastructure to run their own state in the middle of the desert.

The lack of infrastructure, no clear identity and the fact they are all pretty much psychos to begin with would lead them to split into factions pretty quickly.

You can say all you want about it being one game,  but it was one game versus a supposed competitor for a top 4 spot away from home.  Now it wasn't just them that stepped up it was the entire team.  That back four seemed on the same page 95% of the game and they sprinkled in a few errors.  

The prior back for seemed on the same page maybe 60% of the time then had 40% errors (I know these are arbitrary and unfounded numbers,  but it is what I felt watching the games).  Sakho is a good defender,  he is also decent in possession.  He looks awkward and just like everyone else, gives the ball away from time to time.  I think the fact that he looks awkward exasperates the giveaways.  Lovren was the main cause of the main Tottenham chance when he tried to head a ball in front of a player Sakho was marking and it went over his head.  90% of the time that is probably a goal against us and the combo of a shot that wasn't placed that well and a good save from Migs saved the game from going 1-1 before half.

Second half was pretty smooth sailing for them and I didn't really feel the team was in danger at all that half.  The games before we felt in danger constantly,  even against Southampton.   We were quite lucky to get away with all the points there.

So no I don't think people are over reacting to one game.  They are reacting to 3 games,  two that had really poor defending and one that had pretty solid defending.

Without dictators like Assad and Saddam, these countries fall into the hands of the religious extremists and turn into the mess we see today.

Egypt was going the same way until the Muslim Brotherhood got ousted.

Cameron is wrong in saying that Assad is the cause of this. It all started from the so called ""Arab Spring"",  our media was portraying these groups as the way forward and that they were going to bring in a new era of peace through the region.

Essentially the story is this guy goes to a ""real wild party"" with booze and strippers, the whole shebang.  So, you figure he's out for a laugh, maybe get a bit sloshed and see what happens. Then he recognises one of the strippers from school and (I'm sure out of nothing more than politeness) asks her how she got into stripping, so she says ""What would you do if your son was at home crying all alone on the bedroom floor 'cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to sleep with a man for a little bit of money? And his daddy's gone somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lock down, I ain't got a job now. So for you this is just a good time but for me this is what I call life.""

He more or less tells her to stop whinging about it like a bellend and get her shit together, so she tells him: ""Everyday I wake up hopin' to die.  Nigga, I know about pain 'cause me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us.  Before I was a teenager I done been through more shit you can't even relate to!""

And at no point does he say ""For fuck's sake love, I'm just trying to get my buzz on."" or  ""If you go on like this to all your potential paying customers it's no fucking wonder you can't afford to feed your kid.""

Getting paid can be a faff, especially if the other person claims they can't pay. You have to give them every opportunity to rectify it, and normally a letter threatening small claims is actually enough to get stuff rectified.

And:

&gt;help with a problem it's partially (mostly) responsible for.

So you are blaming the UK for starters. Then there is the mayor of Calais calling the UK el Dorado for migrants, threatening to close the port unless the UK fixes her problem because the migrants are only there because of the UK. Tweeting for help from the UK when she has a perfectly good government of her own to consult.

Now if Calais wants to become part of the UK so that David Cameron is the consultant in this matter instead of François Hollande then I'm sure talks could be opened up...

I am inclined to agree because his Moffat episodes were some of the best DW moments in the new series history.

However, I can never forget just how painful it was for me and my wife to love the story and characters and everything about the show, but not feel much love for the main character I grew up with. And his death march still makes us cringe to this day.

It's expensive but has the best facilities in the city, all the equipment you will ever need: swimming pool, rock climbing, Olympic weightlifting, Squash courts, as well as all the sort of standard gym stuff and more. You won't find another gym in Edinburgh that rivals it. If you are a student you can get massive discounts on membership, even if you are not a student of Edinburgh University.


If money is an issue (who am I kidding, money is always an issue) Pure Gym and The Gym are good. &lt;£20 per month (there is a sign up fee) No contract, great if you are just getting into exercise for the first time or after a break and don't want to commit. 24/7 access to the gym but limited hours for the locker/shower rooms.
They have a ton of cardio equipment but tend to be a little short on the free-weights (judging by the two pure gyms I've been to). Plus, the free-weight areas seem to get crowded pretty quickly. So if you want to do certain exercises, particularly those with a barbell, you may have to wait around or go at a less busy time and hope both racks aren't in use (both puregyms I went to only had two, this led to awkward waiting around). 

If you want classes, I know pure gym offer free classes throughout the week but I can't say if any other gyms do. Some even do yoga, there is an extra charge for this.


All three of these gyms have personal trainers in during the day so if you need a little hand you can always ask them, not sure how much it costs though.



**TL;DR** - It all depends on your training priorities, money, level of commitment. The CSE is the best but isn't the cheapest/most convenient. Pure gym/The gym offer flexibility that the CSE and council gyms can't give you.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Well given the bone of contention came down to Ukraine either being a EU candidate or being a Russian Puppet state run like a corrupt Kleptocracy. I think the people who do hold that view need to really work on making their case. 

Won't you at least accept that that is a heavily partial PoV though, and obviously one promoted heavily by the Western media?  Neutralist and Russian media sources take a very different line.  From the latter perspective at least, a Western-funded corporate-backed neo-nationalist/fascist coup occurred on the back of a fairly widespread popular uprising about corruption and mismanagement by a nontheless democratic and legitimate government.  The oligarchs of Ukraine wanted this government to sign up to an agreement with the EU/IMF which would enable large IMF loans in return for a very severe austerity programme and massive cuts to social services in the Ukraine.

&gt;bumbling and bureaucratic as it is, but generally as a force for good. I just can't but into it. 

Some of the leaked conversations and documents put the EU in a fairly poor light in terms of bad faith and conspiring with the US on this, but the US seems to be leading the charge.

&gt;At some point though in this particular case the 'no war' argument has to bite the bullet and accept that 'yes hyper-nationalist super paranoid Russia is allowed its flak jacket of puppet states'. 

Not sure if I understand you exactly here, but if I do I agree that Russia needs its safety blanket to be warm and fuzzy towards us, and we should stop baiting her and leave her be.

Different events can have different levels of activity--certain bands' tailgate might not be suitable for kids and focus more on the drinking, but at the Philly Union game there were little kids running around everywhere. That isn't isn't to say I wasn't drinking, of course, but the tone of the day was more casual.

In the US, the ""drinking in public"" thing is one of the issues where its hard to say anything meaningful about the rules, as they vary from state to state in both actual law and the way police enforce it. Generally though, public drinking is frowned upon, but rarely (especially in the shittier areas of a big city) is anyone going to bother with you, even the police. You can't just walk down the street in a suburb and drink though, that'll get you grabbed real quick.

Culturally, there just has to be a reason for it. A fair, a block party (where all the houses on the block have a party together in the street with kids and everything), something.  If you're in the city or in a small town in the middle of nowhere, as long as you aren't causing a problem you're fine. Yuppie white folk don't like their perfect suburban life disturbed though, so you'll probably get the cops called on you if you're in the middle of the two extremes.

You're quite right they lack the technical expertise to operate these utilities or to maintain them, but equally it's not hard to imagine that they have people who are loyal to their cause locally, or extremist who have migrated (having been educated in Western culture), or finally hostages under duress who have this knowledge and can teach others. 

I also disagree about them killing each other, I think this is wishful thinking. Islam does indeed have a history (much as most monotheistic religions do) of internal fighting and bloodshed, but this is a very specific sect within Islam and they are united under this belief that their interpretation of they holy rule book is the correct one, to legitimise this as a recognised state would only help to reinforce this belief.

true,LordMondando,null,null,"&gt; Won't you at least accept that that is a heavily partial PoV though, and obviously one promoted heavily by the Western media? Neutralist and Russian media sources take a very different line.

I honeslty don't but into this whole 'western media' malarky. It's only the 'western media' when its convient to draw a big circle around them in opposition to something else. Rest of the time a cursory glance of any number of sources will have them conflicting on just about anything. Hell what sense does it make to throw the AP, Vice and the Guardian into the same pot?

As to neutralist sources, hard to even think of what your proposing here? 

As to Russian sources to my mind you really have three groups, russian opposition media, which its generally hard to get access to and well its in Russia. with papers like the Novaya Gazeta, well. They do seem to be following the same 'narrative' as 'the west'. 

Then you have Interfax, which reports in english, and is fairly good. but these days mostly just serves the function of being in a press room with Russian officals and accurately reporting whatever they spout out.

Then you have the rest, which is either directly or indirectly controled (e.g. through things like  RIA Novosti  or just direct government ownership without botthering with the subsidies). Which really is just the same sort of thing as Pravda used to do back in the day, and RT does now. Plenty of ambitious official statements and then we are straight into the WHATABOUTISM. Ferguson seems to be one they like atm. 

In short, from my own examination of the sources, I just don't but into this explanation of the 'media'. 

&gt;Some of the leaked conversations and documents put the EU in a fairly poor light in terms of bad faith and conspiring with the US on this, but the US seems to be leading the charge.

Well did it exploit the situation once it was on the go, sure. Did it create the situation, nope. It's been back and forth between pro and anti Kremlin fractions in Ukraine since independence. 

&gt;Not sure if I understand you exactly here, but if I do I agree that Russia needs its safety blanket to be warm and fuzzy towards us, and we should stop baiting her and leave her be.

On some level though that collapses to 'well empires are ok'. Can't but into that sorry. ",0,1409847085,null,0,false,0,ck91085,t3_2fg7kr,t1_ck91085,t1_ck90k63,null,1427199550,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.

To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genetalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.

If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying last year’s word clouds.

His wardrobe would be flamboyant but dark. I have this fake-suede/fur trimmed black womans trenchcoat that I wear as often as I can in the later months of the year, and it reminds me a bit of #2's giant fuzzy coat. So I'd probably have that be his main signature garb, with varying degrees of shirt and pants underneath it.

As for personality, my Doctor would be a unisexual flirt but with a slightly cynical bent, closer to 9 than 12 (embodied by the black fuzzy womans coat). My Doctor would struggle between the desire to have everyone love each other and live in harmony and the knowledge that this is rarely the case and that evil always finds a way in. This would cause my Doctor to be fairly upbeat in tone yet somber/morose in thought. 

My Doctor's companions would be a Sontaran and a young child. The Sontaran as muscle and to make me feel superior, and the young child to remind me of naivety/hope. Also maybe an annoying electronic AI, possibly stuffed inside a toaster or other inanimate object.

Finally, I'm a broad 5'10"" Welshman, so I wouldn't have the lanky extremities to pull off some of the manic movements that the New Who Doctors have perfected.

There's a long way to go of course, but first impressions weren't great. He should improve though once he settles in and understands the demands Pellegrini places on his fullbacks.

But if I were to critique his performance I'd say the following:

He was very static when we were in possession. He was often stood still on the shoulder of the opposition full back just waiting to receive the ball in a wide area. Zabaleta is very intelligent with holding back slightly, and perfectly timing a late run off the shoulder of the last man. Sagna didn't do this, at all. Made me appreciate even more how valuable Zabaleta is in this respect going forward.

Zabaleta also often makes a run inside the opposition fullback, rather than overlap on the outside. This drags the opposition all over the place, and provides us with an extra dimension going forward.

Sagna looked very rigid, and lacked that timing and intelligence we see with Zab.

Hopefully a lot of that's just down to needing time to adapt to the team and fully understand his role in it.

I doubt he'll be able to play the way we've grown accustomed to Zabaleta playing however, very few players have Zabaleta's stamina and boundless energy up and down the pitch. But we don't expect him to replace Zab of course, just be a reasonable stand in for rotation. But improvement is needed going forward.

He was reasonable defensively, made a fee good challenges and did well contesting high balls.

They do seem to repeat colours a lot across different palettes, so you may want to choose more carefully than I did to avoid redundancy. If you're comfortable using pigments, they have a number of choices there, too. I have a couple, and they seem to be of similar quality to my NYX pigments and my Sleek pigment. Not as good as MAC, but much, much cheaper!

Their lipsticks are hit-and-miss. I've had much better results from the darker ones, generally; the lighter colours just aren't opaque enough for me. Really good value on the hits, though!

I tried the lengthening mascara (the one with the plastic wand); it was very mediocre and not worth using. Avoid!

I tried the liquid eyeliner, which seems okay except that I am not very handy with the style of applicator it uses (plastic cone thingie); I am better with a brush. YMMV.

I have the baked highlighter, peach shade; it's quite pretty. I also have the pressed powder in the lightest shade. I do not like it as much as the MUFE Pro-finish, but it's decent. It's less finely-milled and gives less coverage, but for like £3 it's a damn good deal. Mine broke a little in shipping--it's a bit crumbly/soft.

Did not like the liquid lipstick things--Salvation Velvet lip lacquer, I think they call them. It was similar to the MUA one that I have, which I also don't like.

Mignolet is not good enough for LFC at the moment, he prob has half a season to change that ( and they are mostly things that can be changed) 

He needs to basically improve at every aspect of being a keeper bar shot stopping (granted that's the most important one) or we should look to improve.

When they're reporting on Western foreign policy (Vice was possibly a bit of an exception prior to being gobbled up by News International, I doubt it'll stay that way).  It's been decades since its been possible to put much blue (or red) water between them.

&gt;As to neutralist sources, hard to even think of what your proposing here? 

It's an old cold war term meaning non-aligned.  Generally it was broadly coterminous with third world.  Although there were few explicitly neutral countries because generally one or other of the two great powers would invade them at the drop of a hat for a bit of proxy skirmishing.  The US, particularly, had a very poor record on allowing countries with neutralist foreign policies to exist unchecked (which is one of the things that makes this berating of Russia for invasion so cynically laughable, when you consider the number of countries the West has invaded or played the regime change game with since the second world war).

These days, there are hardly any truly neutralist sources because the whole world has become broadly speaking capitalist, but up until their recent conferences and agreement on setting up an alternative to the IMF, and ultimately presumably the dollar, you might have said that the rest of the BRICS countries were pretty much neutralist as regards post communist Russia.

&gt;Did it create the situation, nope.

Well, there seems clear evidence they at the very least funded it and encouraged belief that EU membership was on the table when it wasn't.

Besides, in Texas, we're getting to the point where us minorities are out numbering the whites, I would think anyone being overtly racist would find their ass promptly kicked - and not just by the minorities, most white people i know would step in to stop it.

You'd really put the Guardian and fox news in the same boat. Come on man, thats absurd. 

&gt;These days, there are hardly any truly neutralist sources because the whole world has become broadly speaking capitalist, but up until their recent conferences and agreement on setting up an alternative to the IMF, and ultimately presumably the dollar, you might have said that the rest of the BRICS countries were pretty much neutralist as regards post communist Russia.

Could you give me a concrete example?

So what do you think the Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement in 2012 was?

I think thats using the term empire to the point where it looses all meaning and just collapses to 'power block'.

Also, the best 125 is the Varadero 125, by an absolute mile.  None of the 'sports' 125s are actually sporty (other than expensive plastics to fix when they gat droipped or knocked), so buy a proper commuter with a fantastic twin powerplant.

true,AimHere,null,null,"&gt;This isn't a political debate, there is no wrong side and people who are voting no probably don't believe different things than you.

No. The independence debate is *obviously* a political debate, and the people who vote a different way from me obviously DO believe different things from me, at least on some subjects. Political ones, no less. And I do believe that my opinions are right and people who disagree with me are wrong. If I didn't believe I was right (and by extension, that people who disagreed were wrong), why would I even hold an opinion?

&gt;don't just try to attack the no campaign and make out that they are anything other than your friends, family or neighbours.

Fuck off.

Not because you're wrong with this particular statement, but because you decided to be a patronising cunt and lecture me on this stuff over a harmless wee joke at the No campaign's expense. I didn't make out the rest of No campaign was anything other than less organized than the actual Orange Order, so why I warrant this straw man attack, I don't know.

&gt;If we incite hatred against the other side then we start off the next day in the worst possible way, at each others throats.

Get over yourself.

I don't need a speech on fucking *incitement of hatred* or five paragraphs of hypersensitive self-righteous strawmannery over a mild little joke at the No campaign's inability to get more than about 250 people in one place at any one time. If you can't tell the difference between 'Ha ha, Better Together rallies are rather small' and actual incitement to hatred then I suggest you go work on your sense of proportion. 

Note that at some points in this campaign, prominent Better Together members have been comparing pro-Independence politicians to dictators, and nationalists to Nazis and spreading rumours about 'carnage' on polling day - MUCH closer to incitement to hatred than my silly wee jibe. I'm sure that there are a few not-so-prominent pro-Independence supporters saying a lot worse things than what I wrote above, too. 

But even so, this whole debate is fairly polite and rational, given the stakes involved - no other secession argument on the planet - save perhaps the split of Czechoslovakia - has been as gentle and reasoned as this, despite the fervent hopes of the mass media. And my joke is still about as mild as the debate on the subject gets, yet I still get hassled over my tone? I believe that there's a phrase for people like you who attempt to phrase snide attacks on one side as some sort of call for mutual understanding - a 'concern troll'.

&gt;Let's drown out the idiots with our reasoned and sensible arguments and move forward together.

What's 'reasoned' about claiming that a political argument isn't political, or that there's no 'wrong' side between two mutually irreconcilable points of view? At least one side in this debate (and maybe both!) *must* be wrong, just as a point of logic. Just because you strung your snide attack together without too many spelling mistakes or *overt* ad hominems doesn't make your illogical gibberish logical, or what you said 'sensible'.

If your idea of mature debate is blandly asserting plain falsities like 'this isn't a political debate', making sleekit ad-hominems and unsupported straw-man insinuations about incitement to hatred and 'attacking the no campaign', then I think the debate is far better off with the idiots in the playground. So no thanks.
