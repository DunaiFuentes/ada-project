For the second, I can't comment on his positioning because I don't have a gif that really shows it but I was able to work out that Hart had around 0.4s to react and then get a hand to it - he doesn't have time to move his body so he is only able to extend his hand. I think it is *very* harsh to criticise his reactions - I think you're trying to find a fault that just isn't there for this goal.

I do agree when you say Hart doesn't inspire confidence but I don't think he could have done much about either goals. If another, more high profile keeper conceded these goals I doubt we would be criticising him.

&gt;How do the Daleks know about the Doctor in ""The Time of the Doctor"" when earlier that season, he was wiped from their memory as a whole?

The Daleks directly stated that they harvested memories from Tasha Lem. Pay attention.
&gt;How was Amy allowed to interact with her younger self in ""The Big Bang?"" while in ~~season~~ *series* 1, Rose interacting wither her younger self caused all Hell to break loose?

Amelia in *The Big Bang* was totally separate to Amy when she was younger. They lived alternate childhoods. Same as Kazran; they'd been fundamentally changed. Not like Rose who was exactly the same as the baby.
&gt;[SPOILERS ~~SEASON~~ *SERIES* 7] While's it's cool that the Statue of Liberty is a Weeping Angel, how is that possible? It's man-made,  and everybody knows it. There's historical proof of it. So how'd it become an angel? What if someone was inside it when it started to move? Is angel-ness contagious? She's not even made of stone, she's made of copper and wood. So does that mean even metal can become a weeping angel? Wouldn't that be a better defense mechanism in the long run? But then what about the bronze bull and bear in NY? Are those angels too? Because that'd be horrifying!

The Angels were possessing other statues, as made evident by the fact that they didn't all look the same, as they usually do. The Statue of Liberty was her normal self in *Daleks in Manhattan* as there was no Angel interference going on.

&gt;And on the note of ""The Angel's Take Manhattan"", I don't very much appreciate the slapped together explanation he gave about not being able to visit the Ponds.

Fine, don't then. However I'd suggest you use your apostrophes more correctly.

&gt;Where did he get the eggs? You know, in ""The Time of the Doctor"", at the end when he makes the fish sticks and custard? You need eggs for that? He's never mentioned having a refrigerator onboard the TARDIS. And don't give me that ""There's a room for everything in the TARDIS"". No. The man had barely enough energy to walk around one level of the TARDIS. Which in itself is another problem with the custard.

So because he's not mentioned having a fridge means he doesn't have one? The TARDIS has a kitchen as well as a food machine, and for all we know he had it stashed in one of the compartments under the console.
&gt;[SPOILERS ~~SEASON~~ *SERIES* 7] In ""The Day of the Doctor"", they both (10 and 11) talk about how sad they are that they burned the planet. But never in the history of Who do they say that. He's always mentioned that they were thrown into a Time-Lock. He never says they were burned. Ever. And trying to tell us something different during the episode frustrated me to no end.

Hang on a second...
&gt;**Ninth Doctor:** *""Your race is dead! You all burnt, all of you. Ten million ships on fire. The entire Dalek race wiped out in one second.""*

&gt;**Dalek:** *And what of the Time Lords?*

&gt;**Ninth Doctor:** *""Dead. They burnt with you. The end of the last great Time War. Everyone lost.""*

Obviously we have a different definition of ""never"".

true,Urbanen,null,null,"Remember the rear wheel acts as a gyroscope, so don't be too heavy on the back brake risking a lock up - the momentum of the wheels helps the bike stabilise. But also don't cut the drive from the engine using the clutch, the bike will want to wallow over unless you turn more sharply to catch it or let go of the clutch again.

You're cornering with the throttle so you want to have the corner speed before you begin turning. I use the limit point to determine if I have the correct speed. Using the limit point also forces you to look through the corner. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkAtWiRq8Q0 - Limit Point

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFm3honeTQo - Countersteering

When you enter the corner with the correct speed, simply keep the throttle at a constant, no increase, no decrease in acceleration.

Think of your bike as a see saw, if you accel the weight sits over the rear, if you lift off the weight sits over the front. You want to balance this out so the bike is smooth. If the bike isn't wobbling, twitching and your throttle is nice and constant your tyres will be getting good bite. So if you need to brake or lift the action will be smooth and you can be confident you have the grip.

 (When you lean a ripple, like a wave, forms in the tyre this is why you can't jab the brake hard but can progressively squeeze it very hard when doing an emergency stop - the ripple gives grip) If you are on and off the throttle the ripple won't be helping and your suspension will be doing more work.
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-BDrAxjAFI - Low speed throttle control

Applying this to a steep down hill I would use a lower gear that ensures my speed stays constant through the corner. If your throttle control isn't very good find some nice slow/fast roundabouts and spend a few hours just riding around. Then you can sit in a low gear in a corner with much more confidence. But also find a car park and try ride your bike at super low speeds.

Then finally you need to know what position you should be in, I like to use the police riders positioning as it gives me the most visibility of the road ahead. But there are many many different bits of advice, there's also the decapitation line you should google so you can avoid it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmYh1FWYtUA  - Road position.


To summarise hit the corner with the right speed, using the limit point teaches you how to know what the right speed is. Then maintain smooth throttle control in the right gear so the bike doesn't run away or slow down, again only you can know what gear will suit that situation. Learn how to use your throttle to catch the bike if it falls, 

TL;DR: Understand the limit point.  The throttle is very important, learn ultra - low speed throttle control and understand counter steering. Understand how road position can give you more time to assess a corner.",0,1410625769,null,0,1410626796,0,ckh8grt,t3_2gaaog,t1_ckh8grt,t3_2gaaog,null,1427032276,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2

Are you kidding? First your side complains about not having enough options beyond Plan A, now you're complaining that he listed too many options! Pathetic. There are several plans, but only plan A is relevant really, since Westminster would be **directly harming the value of the pound** if they refuse to negotiate.

They would be shooting themselves in the foot. That's why they are not giving more details. It's a massive bluff. There were a lot of Pro-Union MPs against Darling for using that angle, evidently because they know it's a dead end.

I bet you haven't even bothered to ask yourself WHY exactly Westminster should refuse a currency union in the first place, other than petty spite. It will cause the UK economy damage to do so, an effect it seems that is already taking place since the pound had dropped drastically in value. Fighting negotiations will only make that worse.

People will lay blame at abstract notions of ""the past"" without fully understanding the implications of that, they can only deal in equivalence; i.e that each side is as bad as the other; they truly believe that this is a progressive stance. It isn't.

- Corners are..... a weak point of ours let's say.

- Balotelli has changed it seems. He isn't getting frustrated and it seems that hes trying to make sonething happen out of nowhere which is always good.

- Markovic is trying to impress us but it seems that he's being a bit too audacious with his attempts and runs e.t.c.

- Senderos has been added to the official cunt list. Alongside famous cunts such as Michael Owen, Alex McCarthy and everyone's favourite Victor Moses.

Our game plan off the ball worked very well. You could tell we'd done our homework on Everton and for the majority of the first half they offered next to nothing other than their goal. It's just a shame we offered even less!

Not sure on Ideye. Him and Berahino kept looking at each other in the first half. They need to form a proper partnership and quick. Neither knew what the other was going to do. Not sure what Ideye's strength is either. Didn't really see him run at pace. Not that strong. Not got a great first touch. Not a poacher.

Thought Pocognoli was the pick of our players. Took a knock in the first half and continued despite that, hence why he came off because he was wincing throughout the first half and stretching his leg in the second half too. Olsson was poor. No other word really. Won his fair share of aerial duels, yes, but his distribution was one or more of slow, over-hit, sideways, straight ahead. Dawson well enough.

I have a major gripe with Wisdom. He's not a full back. He shirks his defensive responsibility and always wants his midfielder to be the first to their winger. He got into a proper argument with Dorrans towards the end for this reason. Dorrans had run 30 yards back after the ball was turned over but was still 15 yards away, and Wisdom wouldn't go to their winger because he's frightened he'll get done for pace. He needs to improve his one-on-one defending MASSIVELY.

Gardner was good. Covered a lot of ground and generally wasn't too wasteful. Like I said in the in-game thread, Morrison was fairly ineffectual: a few good touches here and there but not good enough. Dorrans was ok: worked hard but not a lot going forward - shame he's getting played wide right. Brunt was weird. He worked hard, like our whole midfield to be fair to them, but his final ball was poor, and given that his final ball is meant to be his best asset, that isn't good. My problem with his is his passes are too often over hit, and they're too airy - too much flight.

At first people complained that the term had no meaning and people just threw it around to justify not playing certain players.

Right now the upper classes are pillaging this nation.

Everything, including costly wars, is being put ""on the slate"" and if we go on like this the country is inevitably headed towards total failure. The UKs national debt is not sustainable but politically it will go on so long as New Labour and Tory both follow this tack. The media is fully onboard with it and is not even talking about it being a problem. 

My hope is that Scotland take independence and build a proportionally representative government that becomes the envy of the Anglosphere. This will drive demand for similar systems in rUK, brining about much needed reform to Westminster.

true,Lordzoot,eng-yorkshire,Leeds,"There's a crucial flaw in that argument though, which is raised in the article I linked. Namely, the government has centralised so much of the economy/power in London that money is naturally drawn there. 

For instance, take transport spending. It's ridiculously high in London because it's deemed a requirement for London to function. But one of the main reasons people are forced to do business in London is because the infrastructure of the rest of the UK is totally undeveloped and unsuitable for them to function in. Transport spending in London is around £2,700 per head. In other parts of the UK, it's £5. If London weren't pulling in some serious money with all that spending, I'd be calling for revolution. 

Additionally, the source you've linked doesn't appear to be per capita. London's population is around 8m, whilst Yorkshire's is around 5m. I'd also be interested to know just how that calculation is undertaken, because a lot of that business will actually be from people commuting to London, necessarily, to do deals (hence the article saying it's a drain).

If Yorkshire actually had power over it's own spending, we could build infrastructure which would enable us to increase our revenues etc. As it is, we struggle to get a trolley bus here in Leeds, whilst London gets a massively subsidised Crossrail etc at our expense.

London has massively over-centralised everything, and it's created a bubble environment that is bad for the people who live there (see: house prices, cost of living etc) and bad for the rest of the UK. 

If your argument is that a population of 5 million isn't capable of running its own affairs, then fair enough (I, and around 50% of Scotland, disagree), if your argument is that I should be grateful for London, that just makes me angry, because everyone in the north knows just how fucked over we're getting.

Or unlimited amounts of iScotland money to rUK! It works both ways, when we both own the bank. So mutual economic stability would be the goal for both sides. Bare in mind, that Scotland currently incurs less debt per head than the rUK, with the rUK figure being almost double Scotlands! So isn't it potentially more likely to happen the other way round, if at all? 

Although here's where I may be confused. Why can they not have separate accounts? It is because of the interest rates somehow?

Look at the US, and how a ""perfect"", more modern democracy can fail. They have a two party system, lobbying, super-PACs and all that shit. Presidential campaigns costs hundreds of millions of dollars. And look how they all refuse to cooperate - even shutting down the government for periods of time while they hold each other to ransom.

I don't believe a more ""representative"" system would be better either. Popular opinion is generally a terrible way to decide things (including this referendum which should NEVER have been agreed to hold at 50% + 1 vote). The outcome alone is going to seriously upset half the population one way or the other.

The fact that we have some inherited titles and a royal family honestly doesn't impact our democratic credentials. The current system is pretty great IMO - a good balance between adequate representation and getting shit done. 

We have some incompetent dickheads in parliament, no doubt. And some unqualified career politicians in jobs they don't deserve. But if you want that to never happen, you're asking for a perfect system which does not exist.

Lack of creativity and movement off the ball was the problem today.

Coutinho was really disappointing, especially for someone who is supposed to be the 'creative outlet'. His decision making in the final third was often too slow or oddly selfish. Even if he had our best chance, he still was below his standard.

Balotelli wasn't bad, but he looks like he will really benefit from being part of a two-striker set up. He looked dangerous when drifting out wide, or dropping deep to pick up the ball, but playing up front as a target man for long balls was too predictable.

rUK wants to keep trident based up there. Scotland doesn't want it there.

Mario is too fucking lazy both in attack and defense. He let Senderos go at almost every set piece because he's always ball watching. In attack he makes too few runs and spends too much time out wide. Sure, Sturridge does that too but more effectively.

true,tgeezy,lfc99,,"Few thoughts:

- Too many new faces in the starting XI which greatly disturbed the chemistry/flow going forward, I like the fact Lallana got his debut (he showed good flashes) but not sure why Markovic started over Sterling, he hasn't shown anywhere near enough yet.

- Balo's closing down was nice but he holds play up a little much, hopefully this is just a chemistry/confidence thing and he can pick the speed up a little. Proud of him I guess for not stooping to Senderos' level. 

- Back 4 looked pretty good besides set pieces, I have faith in the Sakho Lovren partnership although they weren't really tested after 15 minutes.

- Gerrard isn't really doing much at the moment besides delivering set pieces and the odd looping ball forward to Moreno/Manquillo. Lovren and Sakho are both able to make the majority of the passes he does and Hendon offers more going forward. Our central third was our weakness in the first half, Gerrard and Hendo were setup too far back and as a result there wasn't much service to the more advanced players 

- Couts is shocking at corners, there's no pace on them at all and they become easy to read/clear for the defense. If Gerrard is on the pitch, he should be taking 100% of them.

- Sterling and Coutinho are getting a little greedy with their shooting from outside the box. I think they both realise that they need to pickup their scoring with Suarez gone, constantly firing shots from distance is not going to do it however. 

- Can't really say much about Lambert and Borini, the bus was well and truly parked by the time they came on and unsurprisingly they were unable to make any noticeable impact.",0,1410633526,null,0,false,0,ckhbxcf,t3_2gb0uk,t1_ckhbxcf,t3_2gb0uk,null,1427030303,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

You say we had plenty of offensive minded players on the field, which is true, and leave the argument there. That's not the whole story. It's not just about who is on the field; it's also about how they're deployed. A double pivot Hendo-Gerrard was redundant and meant that we had virtually no one to pick up the space in front of them, which was badly needed.

Should have started with Lambert and Mario up front or brought on Lambert as soon as we saw the that the original formation wasn't working.

If you look at our first 3 games, its clear our team doesn't do well with a single striker and i'm not sure why Rodger doesn't see this. SG and Henderson can't both be so far back.

Rodger was piss poor today. First sub should have been Lambert for Markovic (at half time), second sub should have been Couthinho for Sterling (65 min mark). Lallana should have stayed on as he was a positive spark.

true,beyondReturn,null,null,"BR is great at responding to mistakes, but at some point his advisers and coaches have to tell him things that are obvious even to fans. Gerrard-Hendo midfield 2 does not work, nor is it likely to work due to the demands  and responsibilities it puts on each player. He knows this, everyone has who has watched them knows this, there is a reason people were asking for Gerrard to be dropped until he moved into that role.


Again and again he underestimates lower ranked teams, at first it was lower divisions where we started with 4 forwards, then it was 2 man midfield again AV last season. There was the period of time Hendo would be used as sub and everyone with set of eyes could see Hendo was superior. If he is to become among the best managers in the game his reaction and risk taking has to be better planned. If you have Suarez or Sturridge on bench for league cup game go ahead and experiment with 2 man midfield or whole new set of forwards, but the PL does not afford mistakes to underdogs.


Sterling had to be benched, that is understandable. Allen who would have kept some of the teams identity intact and Coutinho who would then be put out of position might have saved us some embarrassment, but again it wasn't in his hands. These new players are perhaps not familiar with a diamond formation, but Balo has already played it and so has Lambert. If we wanted more movements up top maybe even Borini who has played out wide and would have less of a problem playing as drifting striker. My point being that we should not experiment with player and formation when we don't have enough game changers on bench and some of our regulars are injured. This is a game to play safe with 3 man or diamond midfield, a game to play as few new players as possible. It should have been played solely for the result and we should have employed players who could continue our style. Borini and Lallana would press well, Balo could be helped by second striker when Senderos was kicking him, Gerrard could do with 2 runners and that would be the system many of our players are used to. A system that would fill the central area against a team that breaks through the middle. From early on if we went down we had 2 strikers who could cross and pass into the box without worrying about finishers.


That said, we got CL game coming up, we have 34 or so league games left and we have some new faces that will integrate.

&gt; Either way, there is no way this ends well if there is a yes vote.

you didn't demonstrate that at all? you simply listed some points of contention and debate that will need to be addressed in the case of independence. i don't see where you demonstrated that ""bitterness and fighting"" is essential to these debates? do you have any evidence that this would be the case aside from emotive comparisons to a divorce? do you have an argument that doesn't appeal to an image of marital strife and emotional disagreement?

&gt; when the economy of both countries starts to get hurt by all the uncertainty - people are going to get pissed off.

&gt; And I for one would certainly direct blame towards Scottish people who voted yes. After all, they were the ones who caused all of this by fucking with the status quo.

i think it's interesting that you seem to be so angry at the scottish for wanting change, somehow upsetting your ""status quo""

have you considered that, as a people, a great deal of them are already ""pissed off"" by the status quo itself? they don't feel it benefits them at all and for them change is essential to their own desires and ambitions for Scotland? why should the scottish people support a status quo that they believe they suffer under?

&gt; I would expect MY government to fight their hardest to get the best deal for MY country. So that means the UK government going no-holds-barred, aiming for absolute victory in all negotiations and the sweetest deal possible for the UK.

how does what you want the government to do mean they are going to do it? what are you basing that on?

I am friends with people on both sides and it has been a very open and respectful debate, both sides realise that getting angry isn't going to convince anyone so it makes no sense to start animosity. Each side is trying to convince the other, there is almost no strong arming going on as it would only serve to hurt their arguments.

I couldn't really tell for sure if they were saying there was never any hidden alien or if it was all in the doctor's mind. They never really explained why the alien decided to make it's presence known under the sheet which kind of needed explaining as there was no motive.

**Edit:** Just realised they put in a possible explanation for the sheet ghost, they mention it could have been another kid! Later on when the lock starts to turn they also explain it could also possibly be due to the pressure mechanism automatically opening it!

true,Silent_Ranger,null,null,"**Henderson** was amazing today in a holding role, he was the best midfielder on the pitch in all facets of the game.


**Markovic** is too inconsistent, he had a few flashes of good play but overall had little impact on the game.


**Lallana** wasn't match-fit and it showed but he was the most dangerous attacking player until Sterling came on.


**Balotelli** is very good at exerting himself physically on the game but he reads the play too slowly when there are others making runs ahead of him.


**Moreno** wasn't very sharp on the ball with several poor touches.


**Sterling** is a dynamic and dangerous attacking player but he's not as savior, he can't single-handedly win games like Suarez.


**Manquillo** was excellent both going forward and defensively, he provided a wide outlet and the only mistakes he made defensively he was able to cover up on his own.

**Coutinho** was probably the most involved attacking player but is still a more effective playmaker and chance creator when he's further from goal, it seems his unfamiliarity with playing deeper makes him think more rather than react instinctively which leads to better decision-making.

**Gerrard**, **Sahko**,  and **Mignolet**, were never really in a position to affect the game because of the deep line and low offensive pressure from Aston Villa.

**Lovren** is culpable for losing Senderos on the corner that lead to the goal.

The reason Liverpool lost today was because of ""sticky"" ball movement in the final third, there was too much dribbling and the ball movement was too slow and too safe. Conversely Villa defended very well the whole game with numbers behind the ball and prevented Liverpool from getting any clear-cut chances.


With the benefit of hindsight Liverpool could have performed better if Markovic started on the bench and Lambert had started up top with Balotelli to give a stronger physical presence up top and more bodies in the central areas (Markovic simply didn't create enough danger on the wings to justify his inclusion).


Liverpool will not win the league this year because they need time to gel as a team with all the new players (especially the defense) which will result in dropped points in games like today particularly during the first half of the season.

true,Duc_de_Nevers,null,null,"I wore school uniforms from 5-18.  My primary school was very traditional - we still had caps in the 1980s, and long trousers were only permitted in the last two years of school.  Blazers and ties, obviously.  Wearing the caps was not mandatory, but you had to have it regardless.  There were periodic cap inspections and woe betide the boy who could not produce his cap on demand.  Secondary school maintained the school blazer and tie thing until 5th year (age 16).  Sixth formers could wear a suit or whatever blazer they chose (within reason).

I didn't find wearing a uniform particularly onerous, but then I was fortunate in the colour schemes chosen by my educational establishments.  They chose muted solid colours (pupils at a local private school were [not so lucky](http://www.monkhouse.com/category/2090/Hale_Prep_Uniform).  Wearing a uniform did free me from having to think about what to wear on any given school day, but I suspect it has informed my dress sense ever since, which remains quite conservative.  I am perfectly comfortable in a suit, however, and can tie a tie in a variety of knots.

Naturally, people tried to push the limits in order to gain a sense of individuality - particularly in the sixth form.  Finding loopholes and exceptions was a popular pastime for some.  I learnt a variety of tie knots at this point, and discovered the wonders of double cuffs and began a cuff link collection.  A major step was the realisation that the uniform guidelines for sixth formers did not exclude waistcoats, though some regulations came in after a few people pushed it too far with waistcoats that were too loud (and this was the nineties, so please take a moment to consider what ""too loud"" meant in that context).  A few of us also hit on the idea that as a cravat was technically a type of tie, we should be in the clear if we could commission a cravat with appropriate school markings.

&gt;[Brigadier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadier) __John Enoch Powell__, [MBE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Most_Excellent_Order_of_the_British_Empire) (/ˈdʒɒn ˈiːnɒk paʊl/; 16 June 1912 – 8 February 1998) was an English politician, classical scholar, linguist, and poet. He served as a [Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK\)) Member of Parliament (MP) (1950–74), [Ulster Unionist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Unionist_Party) (UUP) MP (1974–1987), and [Minister of Health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Health) (1960–63). He attained most prominence in 1968, when he made a controversial speech on immigration, now widely referred to as the [""Rivers of Blood"" speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivers_of_Blood_speech). In response, he was dismissed from his position as Shadow Defence Secretary (1965–68) in the [Shadow Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Cabinet) of [Edward Heath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Heath). Thirty years later Heath commented that Powell's remarks on the ""economic burden of immigration"" had been ""not without prescience.""

I'd just like to add to my previous response a bit more.

One thing that particularly puzzles me about the people who defend Joe on performances like today's, is that if you guys don't see any thing wrong with such performances, then surely you don't rate Joe that highly?

If you're not expecting him to do better, or be more convincing, then clearly you don't expect much of him.

My criticisms are borne out of expecting a higher standard from him, likewise any goalkeeper that lines up between the sticks here.

It's getting to the stage now where every week people are saying, fans and commentators alike: ""Joe should do better there"".

Every week.

You don't need to make a glaring error to have a poor performance as a goalkeeper.

I expect better, we should expect better of Joe.

But somehow there's always an excuse, or some roundabout way to absolve Joe of so-so or even poor goalkeeping.

 Moffat *can* still write well!!...mostly...

Am I right in saying it was a paradox episode kinda? Doctor remembers this dream he has...is intrigued...tells Clara. Goes to Pink's place, recites that piece about what's under the bed etc, which Clara hears and then goes onto tell the Doctor himself......which ends up coming full circle...when he tells Clara..?

I totally missed the point about this episode. I need to stop taking everything so literally...thanks for explaining reddit...my mind is simple apparently.

I really liked the opening monologue – how we saw the doctor thinking out loud walking through his deductions and setting up a premise to the episode. I also liked how we see him by himself showing he doesn’t always have a companion attached (apart from xmas eps).


I also enjoyed Jenna’s performance in the episode and that Clara is able to make a stand against the Doctor and put him in place if needed. It’s a breath of fresh air post Amy and Rory. Also how she convinced the doctor not to look at the time – shows he has a level of trust that I just didn’t feel with amy.


One thing I didn’t like though is the fact that we saw a thing on the bed , we saw it disappear, we saw the door turn, we hear something. And yet we end with what if nothing was there and the Doctor is just scared of the dark when we know there is something. It’s way too much just to wipe clean without proper answers. I know all of these were explained in the ep (kid, pressure etc). It just annoyed me that it was a long way of telling us he is scared of the dark.
Loved the Danny pink stuff however not sure what’s happening as they are making companions special again. Something that I hoped we may have stopped for a while.


Also note no Missy or Promised land. I wonder when we will next see them referenced or appear.

“Well, here we are on our long-awaited date!”

“Yes, we are indeed on a date.”

“Shall we open up with a complete lack of chemistry?”

“Sounds good! Let’s follow up with the most inane and awkward banter in the history of humanity.”

“Nice, nice. Want to spill something on each other and make things super awkward while trying to wipe each other’s crotch area with a napkin?”

“Hmm, actually I was hoping we could take offense at absolutely everything the other one says and have an extremely forced argument for the sake of having an argument.”

“Ooo, sign me up for that!”

Oh god – Clara is adorable, Pink is adorable, but every moment they are on screen together is painful to look at. I know it’s intentional, but it hurts – I hope Moffat is going somewhere with those two.


~~~~~~~~~~~



“CLARA! I’ve figured it out! We are never alone! There are creatures that are so good at hiding that they spend every waking moment of their lives shadowing our every step!”

“Doctor, that’s terrible! How did you discover this?”

“It’s because I talk to myself and also a lot of people have had bad dreams sometimes that there are things under their beds!”

“...so, basically, no hard proof or anything of that sort?”

“Nope! Let’s goooo!”

“Ok. Wheeeee!”


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


“Doctor, there IS an unknown hiding horror! It’s sitting under the kid’s cover and it will do terrible things to us if we discover it!”

“I know, we must promise it that we will never discover it so it doesn’t do terrible things to us...is it gone? Phew. LET’S CONTINUE IN OUR EFFORTS OF DISCOVERING IT!”

“Ok. Wheeeeeeee!”


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


“Hey, Doctor, guess what! There wasn’t actually a hidden horror at all! It was MEEEEE, I hid under your bed while you were a kid once and grabbed your ankle and scarred you for life!”

“Hahaha, that’s hilarious!”

“I know, hahaha!”

“Hahahaha.”

“Let’s forget all about the creepy creature under that kid’s cover like it never existed, HAHAHAHA!”

“Don’t have to tell me twice, HAHAHAHA!”

Seriously, though, what the crap was that thing? The conclusion of the episode made it look like Clara was the one to ‘implant’ this idea/fear of something hiding under the Doctor’s bed into him when he was little, but then what the heck did we see in Pink’s room?


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Overall: this was terrifying. I loved it! There were a couple of moments when I was more creeped out by the Doctor than by the hidey-horror. I feel like the plot itself was either a bit wobbly or I’ve missed something, but in all other aspects the episode was just lovely – it was visually beautiful, it was amazingly acted (Capaldi is freaking amazing!), it was terrifying when it wanted to be and it was really contemplative. I loved that it was a story of fighting not a creature-of-the week but the Doctor’s own demons. Even if I still have no clue what the diddly was that thing in Pink’s room then.

They were probably trying to scare Danny but got scared when two adults were in the room with them. The way the Doctor was talking to it could have been interpreted by the child as an opportunity to leave without getting in trouble about their prank, so they scamper off.

I think everyone has similar dreams because psychologically all humans are at least someways identical. The fear of something grabbing us from where we can't see, at a time where our brains are in a mode that lets imagination run wild. 

They were on a desolate planet at night. It could be calm during the day, but winds could be strong at night and be flinging debris at the shuttle. The airlock could have been compromised when the Doctor opened the door and as he said, the turning of the lock could have been an automatic mechanism.

That man went on an enormous journey , from pure hatred and sectarianism, to eventually entering into the peace agreement, and bringing his followers with him.   

When I was growing up during the troubles, i never imagined that McGuiness and Paisley would ever shake hands - and yet they did.

Thanks to Ian Paisley , I now see the Loyalists of Northern Ireland as not somebody to hate - but part of the rich history of the island of Ireland.  

LIKE Ian Paisley, my early life was consumed with hatred of the ""other""..

That and the sky wasn't orange. But I'm being picky. I also feel a lot of Pertwee coming out of Capaldi's Doctor. Anyone else?

The fact that the police uniformly did not take sexual crime seriously. It's only in the last two decades or so that adult victims of rape have been taken seriously and even then there are hundreds of cases coming to light where the police did nothing. Every stone we lift into the police reveals even more nasties. 

&gt; And people who wanted to tackle the issue of Muslim rapist got called racist, and one was send to lessons on how to be more politically correct.

Did they? And what proof of this is there? The mere word of someone trying to avoid criticism and possible jail time?

I would advise being a little more reluctant in believing the word of the people who let this happen in the first place. Classic redirection of blame. 

&gt; Plenty of officers got fired for making an offensive tweets.

Fair enough, the English police do seem to have some genuine problems with racists. The lack of any meaningful effort into investigating and prosecuting for the murder of Steven Laurence for example. Was that ""political correctness""? 

Note I'm not saying that everyone involved was malicious or willing. Much of this was caused by a complete lack of funding or general focus on child protective services. This applies to all child welfare issues, not just sexual violence. See the investigation into the Baby P scandal, those involved tried to flag up their concerns many times and fuck all happened.

Remember the big blow up about ""THE DOCTOR IS WEARING HIS COAT BUT HE LOST IT"" 'continuity error' way back when that turned into a massive plot point by the end of the series..

This ep not only seeds itself into the past (the barn/War Doctor) but the future itself - Clara has indirectly and directly interfered with Rupert/Dan's timeline, not only subconsciously making Dan fall for her but also made (in both seances of the word) a future family member have his drive for time travel, also while influencing Clara herself to make Dan join her and the Doctor - once Dan and/or the Doctor realize this MASSIVE CAN OF WORMS will open. This is bound to happen once Dan joins the crew and discovers 'his' figure in the TARDIS.

Plus two other points Clara can now fly the TARDIS, yes yes the interface could be a throw away plot device, but she isn't the first human to 'interface' with the TARDIS to fly it on some level... and to GALLIFREY!

Gallifrey pre-Timewar and Time lock - so they CAN get there? Interesting how the Doctor has never thought about getting around the lock by going to the past, or was this purely Clara's doing 'willing' the TARDIS subconsciously to break the lock (and dimensions) to get there, OR now the real future and 'fate' of Gallifrey is known is the lock permanently broken  and the Doctor just chooses not to explore that option out of fear? (We kinda know why Clara told him not to go out there due to the Doctor's warning of crossing yourself in the timeline earlier in the ep)

My only issue with the episode is that it ruined its own build-up. The best part of the episode was easily the creature under the bed and wondering if we would ever see it or not. Implying at the end of the episode that there was never a creature and that Clara was responsible for the Doctor's theory ruins all of the established mystery - I know it remains somewhat open-ended, but it's *heavily* implied that it was never really there to begin with, ruining the entire basic 'what if' premise of the episode.

If the episode had remained focused on a creepy creature we never actually got to see, ending with a ""but was it ever really there anyway?"" climax, it would've left a much greater impression. Instead, everytime I rewatch this I'll rewatch it knowing that the intended answer is that it isn't there.

I also don't like the fact that the Doctor's 'fear' speech was influenced by Clara.

&gt;

&gt;__Roald Dahl Plass__ ([Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language): ___Plas Roald Dahl___) is a public [plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaza) in [Cardiff Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_Bay), part of [Cardiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff), [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales). It is named after Cardiff-born author [Roald Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Dahl),  and is located on the coast along the south of the city centre. The square is home to the [Senedd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senedd) ([Welsh Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Assembly) Building) and the [Wales Millennium Centre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales_Millennium_Centre), a [performing arts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_arts) centre. The bowl-like shape of the plaza has made it a popular [amphitheatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphitheatre) for hosting open-air [concerts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert). 

&gt;Formerly named the __Oval Basin__, the area was one of the docks for a thriving [coal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal) [port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port) during the latter half the 19th century and much of the 20th century. Following [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II), the plaza entered a period of decay and dereliction until the 1980s, when the Cardiff Bay area was [regenerated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_regeneration). 

&gt;""Plass"" means plaza in [Norwegian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_language), a nod to the acclaimed writer's roots (both of Dahl's parents were from [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway)) and to the [Norwegian seafarers' church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Church,_Cardiff) which stands nearby.

As an example I have a Suzuki Van Van and used to have a Bandit, according to Suzuki both have a seat height of 770mm. Yet I can get both feet flat on the Van Van but could only get the balls of my feet down on the Bandit. that's because the VV is a narrow single cylinder bike and the Bandit is a much wider four cylinder bike. 

In short you need to sit on the bikes to see what fits. 

You don't need to to get  both feet flat on the ground, in fact so long as you can get one foot down you'll be fine.

Yes, I think so. Obviously this ICM poll is a bit of an outlier, but every poll for the last year seems to have been extrapolated into a seemingly accurate picture of public opinion.

I don't see any problem with extrapolating one poll, even if its meaning becomes far more useful when coupled with other polls to describe a trend, and perhaps spot outliers (which this one still appears to be).

I do think its tight mind you. But as even the OP's article says fairly modestly, there are seriously methodological problems with this poll.

But people find it exiting so methodological problems don't matter. 

As i've said to other people, its not just about getting 1000 answers, running the stats and POLL DONE. You often get more than that, sometimes by an order of magnitude, you then need to construct a sample size from that (because no number you can reasonably get in time will ever be represenative of a population size many orders of magnitude larger). 

I remeber when I was working, we'd often get a lot of flak for not getting enough 17-21's. Fuckers never answer polls. Because we'd allready have hundreds of other groups form other age and socioeconomic brackets, and needed X amount of these to feed into the sample.

the fact its only 705 *in total* means the poll was rushed to fuck and certain groups (being an internet polls, younger people i'd bet) will be MASSIVELY overrepresented.

It's the equivalent of going into 4 pubs, two in Cardiff and asking and asking what the best club in the UK is. 

Pundits will run it as it makes a good bit of news and gets them clicks, nationalists becuase it demostrates 'the surge'.

I'm never one for any individual poll really, they are only useful in groups again because of sample issues. but a single poll that couldn't get to 1000 in its *sample size*. It's next to meaningless. They clearly were given a stupid time frame to do it in and this is a 'fuck it that'll do' job.

Also, if Hendo starts deeper, in theory he should protect our defence more often but it rarely works out this way. 

Gerrard is better when really deep, Hendo is better when pushed up and shuttling between spaces, moving the ball quickly and regaining the ball.

Coutinho has been awful in both home games, and he played a 10 in both. That is a contributing factor.

Something I have noticed is that when we face a smaller team using 4-3-3, we really struggle to create chances and score goals. The diamond has become our natural formation because it focuses the ball inward, which is our strength as we are able to run towards goal. It gets two strikers on two, and Sterling of course is unplayable at times in that role.

Notice today the difference Sterling made as he picked the ball up in tight positions, mostly central and drove at Villa. Markovic couldn't do this because he started out really wide.

No, you have to construct a represenative sample out based on the populations overall demographic trends still. 

You do pick randomly from data sub-sets for various socio-econmic groups and such from the larger data set. But you still need to have represenative overall demographic subsamples. 

1000 is used becuase it allows you to go to 1dp levels of precision normally in overall demographics. 

&gt;What does that mean? What statistical principle tells you that 705 people is not close to enough?

Industry standard is you build the actual sample out of 1000, from a much larger data set. The larger data set often *won't* be represenative, for phone polls for example, sometimes as much as 50-60% will be 60-75's. However the sample itself needs to be represenative of that actual sub-sets presence in the population.

true,al455,mccoy,McCoy,"What a wonderfully creepy, insidious episode chock-full of what Moffat does best - time-twistingly inventive plots and primal fears. A very character-orientated way of telling a story, with the date as a hook to the rest of the plot. Danny and Clara's would-be-relationship is pretty much what you can expect when you travel with The Doctor, and here we see it portrayed in a fun, light way, which is really saying something when the story is centered on the creature who's under the bed.

Can I be the first to say that seeing a young 1st Doctor with matching hair to his older, Hartnell portrayed self, is a bloody delight, and I'm glad Moffat handled the un-explored territory in such a meaningful way to The Doctor's overall character.

I'm a little confused on what was under the bed-sheet in the early scene, but I loved how Moffat deliberately wrote all the lines about escaping gas, and creaking metal in the later scenes, playing off our own imaginative fears. The bed-sheet-monster will probably be explained later, but if not, it'll be an interesting enigma - Was there really a monster at all?

Some people are already asking was the Doctor on Gallifrey in the bed scene? Or an offworld planet? How could Clara get through the time-lock if it is Gallifrey? Is only the Time War time-locked? Does it even matter after it was placed in a pocket universe? Who gives a toss, we got a rare glimpse into the childhood of The Doctor, savour it for all it's worth!

This is, in my opinion, one of Moffat's best scripts and certainly one of the best non-two-parter's of his, if not the best.

The Doctor probably wrote on the chalkboard but forgot, it happens when you're absent minded and thinking about a million different things at the same time. There was that whole bit about your coffee suddenly being gone and what not, it's the same principle.

Everyone has that dream because at some point everyone is afraid of the dark. And then it's just putting 2 and 2 together. Sometimes you hear breathing, so it's definitely a person like thing. Underneath your bed is dark and it's ""behind you"" when you lie in your bed. Which makes it the most scary place in your bedroom. There's enough space for someone to hide there. Even though fear is irrational, that doesn't mean it doesn't follow patterns. 

&gt;What was so scary about the knocking that Orson was still afraid of it after six months?

He'd been utterly alone for 6 months. Hearing those noises at night, when you're utterly alone, it's terrifying. Fear takes a hold. You start to believe there's something out there. Which is why he lied. Part of him wasn't convinced.

1.) We needed another top class CB. We can still make it through the whole season and win trophies but I believe next summer we need to look into getting Varane to replace Terry. 

2.) Courtois is still getting to grips with the defensive line, he is a great shot stopper and a very good keeper in general. But he needs to take command of the back 4 and improve his distribution. This will happen naturally as he plays more games with a settled back 4.

Therefore, even travelers with a spent conviction are not eligible to travel visa free; they must apply for B-1 or B-2 visas.

He's also been convicted of careless driving, so it's perfectly possible that they refused ESTA to him based on that alone. Never mind the second conviction for driving offences and the conviction for assault. 

While the ESTA does mention 'moral turpitude', in reality they don't much care if it falls under that or not. A conviction is a conviction, and it doesn't look good for the person wishing to enter the USA regardless of the specific nature of the conviction. There are a fair few people complaining that they've been refused ESTA for minor driving offences, despite US law clearly saying they do not involve moral turpitude.

It really doesn't matter if they're both together in a formation, Rodgers never sets his teams up to be that rigid.. every player is given freedom and it's not really a pivot 2 unless it's Lucas alongside Gerrard..

Here's some heatmaps when Liverpool played Newcastle.. 41212...

http://i.gyazo.com/d5984516f59a23820a7f98b2a5dea022.png Henderson

They're practically identical to the ones from today and so are the heatmaps from the other week when we beat Spurs 3-0... anyway I don't see why this matters as Henderson had a pretty good game and was involved quite a lot... our problem was with the front 3 and Coutinho.

I'm sorry and I know it's hard to hear, but the UK is indeed stagnant, not just economically.  The infrastructure here is an absolute mess, and so many other things are just, well, behind the times. The flooding/drought problem, the Victorian plumbing, the rail costs/substandard services. Royal mail's substandard service at extremely high price as well. The NHS being stripped down for parts, the roads. These are just a few things that I, as an outsider, have noticed. I know these things seem 'normal' if you've grown up here, but they're holding you back.

There's a fascinating infinite bureaucracy loop that completely prevents anything from moving forward. An infinite loop of 'pass the buck', where no one ever has to take responsibility for anything. It's apparent in all fields, from politics, to the councils, to police, to business. 

I very much enjoy being here, I love the people, and the witty culture. But it just seems like England's falling behind in a lot of ways, without even realizing it. I have faith that most of the population here is an intellectual one that may someday realize this, especially as people have more opportunity to watch other countries advance. 

In the mean time, if I were Scotland, I would be running. They have an opportunity to move forward here. Otherwise, they'll be stuck in the (sorry) economical and technological backwaters for a long time to come. I absolutely would wish them the best and good job getting out while you still can!

I think a better alternative would be setting up Regional Parliaments (like a Midlands Parliament, or a South West Parliament), who have greater autonomy like the Scottish Parliament, then people within those regions elect representatives for a full UK Parliament (like how we elect MEPs). This means that you have a substantial number of people actually living in the areas where they make policies. 

Of course that isn't perfect, and as a big government socialist I'm always a bit sceptical of introducing more divisions (the best solution would be to have MPs who are actually competent, but what's the chances of that happening?), but I personally think that is the way to go about it.

But I may just do my CBT before I turn 19 because I wouldn't be able to ride anything &gt; 125cc until I pass my A2 test(at least that's how I think it works). 

Choosing a bike is a bit of an issue. I had my eye on A LOT of bikes but they either didn't fit into the A2 restrictions or they weighed too much - How would you know if you would be able to handle the weight of a motorcycle, does it depend on how much you can bench press? - But I think I may settle for a Honda: CBF 125,CBR 250R (post 2011 model) or Kawasaki ninja 250r, Kawasaki 125 Eliminator or yamaha ybr250

As you can see I don't know if I should get a 125cc or 250cc (but no higher) any help deciding would be appreciated. 

Would it be worth it to buy a 125cc motorcycle to get comfortable with the controls of one, and develop a high level road sense which motorcyclists require before taking my practical test. Or should I hold off on my purchase until after I've passed. ^If ^I ^ever ^do ^pass

The only times you should do that are for changing gear, just before stopping, and if you are doing a full-bore emergency stop. Otherwise you should have the engine engaged so that you can move smoothly from braking to accelerating without a jerk as you engage the clutch, and so that you are always in the right gear for the circumstances.

Slow down in a straight line, changing down so that the engine remains in the power band - i.e. on a 125 you would probably want to keep it around 4-5000 rpm. I know it will run smoothly below that, but keeping the revs higher will give you better engine braking and make it easier to control. Now release the front brake before you lean over. Also release the back brake unless the road is so steep that you can't keep the speed down without it. BTW, apart from safety, the other reason for not using the front brake when turning is that it will compress the forks, which changes the steering geometry. 

You should now be able to turn in more easily than if you have the clutch in or have the engine revs too low. The drag of the closed throttle should allow you to control the speed, and because the forks are not compressed, the bike should be easy to handle.",0,1410643532,null,0,false,0,ckhg7v0,t3_2gaaog,t1_ckhg7v0,t3_2gaaog,null,1427027968,0,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,0

From TVTropes:

&gt; A ""bottle episode"" is designed to take up as little money as possible. The easiest way to go about this is to use only the regular cast (or even just part of the regular cast) and set it in a single location, especially if you have a main standing set. This keeps production costs down, because no one needs to scout locations, build new sets, or create fancy CGI graphics of the outside of the spaceship. Bottle episodes are often a chance for a slow, characterization-filled episode before/after a big special-effects-laden action episode. Of course, all this doesn't mean the episode will be cheap, just that it's meant to be; like any regular episode, unforeseen complications can cause the show to run over the scheduled budget.
&gt; 
&gt; Note that the term has become synonymous with ""single-location"" episode, even though bottle episodes can (theoretically) have as many locations as a normal episode. All that matters is that it costs less, because the money is having to pass through a ""bottleneck"".

Now they are trying to figure out their roles, the squad style/system and how they interact. Before he would have great relationship with Lallana/Rodriguez etc. and he would give the ball and receive other times, he would have his own targets like getting a goal or 3 shots on targets etc. and would be allowed to be selfish due to his reputation/standing within the squad. Now it might be ""play well"" or he might give more than he takes. He should be selfish as striker, demand the ball, shoot from far and short distances, but he is in his head too much to focus on the defenders etc. He is thinking of the fans, the manager, the other players too much to just focus on what he does best. I hope he snaps out of it and just starts smashing the balls in and dominating defenders, he is a senior player and should take more responsibilities than Hendo/Sterling/Coutinho etc.


Too many new faces that he hasn't played with, like he can't grab Borini and talk about how he is going to do this or that due to them not having had much playtime or understand between them. When he settles he will be great I think, great squad player who can start some vital games when we are in need. But Balo for all the talk of arrogance is really quiet, maybe that's good, but he should still have some of that fire that made him what he is, it was a bit sad to see him being kicked and not responding. Like that Torres incident when he was tripped by Ferdinand and he just went about his business.

true,PloppinFresh,null,null,"I think when recruitment began this summer, it was Rodgers' intention to line up with a 4-2-3-1 as his preferred system, which I think was reflected in the players he brought in early on. There was a lot of talk about how Sturridge would become Liverpool's outlet, and as a result, recruited a supporting cast (pacey, industrious, creative) he thought would work best. 

However, after losing to United in the ICC final (or whatever the fuck that thing is called), it was clear that Sturridge needed a partner, and the focus for an additional striker shifted from bringing in a solid backup (Remy) to having someone partner Studge, hence the arrival of Balotelli. 

It's clear the diamond works best, but I'm guessing this won't be the last we see of the 4-2-3-1, either because of injury-related reasons or Rodgers' determination to make the system work. If we stick with the diamond - which we absolutely should, considering its efficacy - it means he's forced to play with fewer creative, industrious players, with at least two of Markovic, Lallana, Coutinho, Allan, Henderson and Sterling having to remain on the bench. 

I mean, I get it. I understand why he wants all these players on the pitch, but the system just doesn't work (slow, cluttered). A diamond consisting of Gerrard, Henderson, Allan (Lallana) and Sterling at the tip has proven to be our best formation by some margin. It's creative, dynamic and quick.

This makes out like the Angles, Saxons and Jutes all but wiped out the Celts, or forced them to migrate. And they came over in bloody raids.

Actually, though there were some conflicts. Most migrated here peacefully and more took up farming. And the indigenous people were not wiped out or forced to move. Anglo-Saxon culture just grew and the natives started to adopt it.

DNA tests of may in the UK show they have bloodlines going back many thousands years predate ding the Saxons, Celts even the Beaker people but research suggests often when these migrations into the country have occurred they have influenced the culture a lot but not had significant impact on the makeup of people on the land.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;These fees were meant to weed out vexatious or frivolous claims, but according to the article there's been a 70% reduction. To me that suggests the fees have gone too far and are stopping legitimate claimants coming through because they can't afford to.

If you have Netflix watch the documentary Hot Coffee.

It's about tort reform in the US and is wrapped around the case where a woman sued McDonalds after spilling coffee on herself.  *(As an aside, I'm going to say now that if you read that and thought, ""Yeah, I heard about that and it was ridiculous!"" you'll find what actually happened eye opening)*

The reason I suggest this is that nearly everyone heard about that case and based on partial reporting nearly everyone thought it was appalling.  Nearly everyone supported tort reform because they all thought it was about stopping stupid, frivolous cases.  Cases which cost everyone money because the costs are passed onto consumers.  Cases where some unscrupulous weasel enriches themselves unfairly.

The last few lines should have started to sound a lot like employment tribunal reform here.  And...  For that matter...  Benefits reforms and legal aid reforms and pretty much any reform you'd like to point a finger at in the last few years.

If you do watch it, or even if you don't think about this in the context of the phrase, ""Hard-working families.""  David Cameron is awfully fond of that phrase, isn't he?  All these changes to help **hard-working families**.  This is because you're meant to hear those words and think he means you.  You worked hard before you were dismissed, didn't you?  It's not supposed to screw **you**.  You work hard.  You're the guy he's out to help, right?

You might want to find out the details of your local office (first link) and ask them about the three year kind of search.  Each search should cost £10.

true,JeffThePenguin,tennant,Tennant,"EDIT: SORRY MASSIVE SPOILERS TO TONIGHT'S EPISODE, I read the thing at the top briefly and therefore wrong, my mistake :X   
-  
Maybe the person in the bed isn't The Doctor like we have been pushed to believe, after all, this is Moffat's work and he tends to put obvious, but wrong, things in plain sight. My idea is that the person is The Master.....who is actually 'Danny'. Obviously we heard about the child being ""Timelord"" and talk of the army and being a ""soldier"", which both The Doctor and Master are. Another point is travelling in time: in this one episode we saw Rupert Pink (young), Danny Pink (modern), and Orson Pink (future)...and Orson happens to openly be a time traveller. Whatever/whoever it was under the sheet in Rupert-age could maybe also be The Master, because we know he's mischevious and likes pranks/jokes/tricks, so it actually was a 'friend' who lives in the building too, but was himself who had come back in time and so there were two of them in the same place (like we see of Clara when she leaves the restaurant and is just coming from the TARDIS)....not too sure about this last bit making sense, especially with the small shot of the 'thing' we saw with the short, bald, wide head, but thought I'd say it anyway :P The Master/Danny is getting close with Clara because he seems to do this with other companions in the past, e.g Marth Jones - kidnapped her family and everything else, just to get close to The Doctor, and also forces himself into their way by spreading himself all over time and space, hence why The Doctor happens to 'find' Orson at the end of the universe (which is only 100 years in Clara's future?? Maybe due to the 'impossible girl' stuff and her being spread all through time too, like in the past with all other Doctors?). My friend pointed out and asked, ""why does everyone have the dream?"" which is an amazing point because if the 'thing' under the bed really has been Clara all along, due to her grabbing the foot of the child on the bed in the barn place, why is that significant to everyone else ever? I got a good split second thinking time about it and managed to come up with the words ""telepathic field"". So, Clara's mind gets linked telepathically with the TARDIS to go to her childhood and find the source of the dream in her experience. She gets a phone call from Danny, which distracts her train of thought and thus they end up at Danny's childhood instead. Maybe The Master knew when she was linked with the TARDIS because of some paradox-type-thing where it actually happened twice (imagining it's possible to have two different time streams of the TARDIS' where-abouts and events inside): once where no interuption happened, and they ended up at Clara's childhood, and another where the Master had gone back along the time stream AFTER Clara had linked into the TARDIS, so he knew when it would happen, and therefore rang her phone, which distracted her thought process and so they ended up at 'Danny's childhood'......a false artificial human alibi childhood of The Master's form (this could be why he was in a home, and didn't have a family, because that's extra work to just 'create' so that it's believable). This then allowed The Master to project himself, in the physical form of Danny, all over the place, close with The Doctor and Clara, such as; the school where Clara works in N.T ('normal time' - modern era where companions are living their normal lives....can N.T become cannon as the term for this plox?) and at the end of the universe. Remembering that The Master has a history surrounding telepathic systems, for example the Archangel Network that allowed him to control people's minds and forcibly put him in power on Earth which resulted in him becoming the most powerful, and only person on the planet after changing everyone's faces...). Can't think of much else to say about this episode right now so yeah....except one thing; The Family - specifically Sister Of Mine, who was trapped by 10 in every mirror and 'everytime you think you see something move behind you in a mirror, that's her....that's *always* her""...I thought there would be a clear obvious link with this old episode, but I didn't see one :s",0,1410646619,null,0,1410647201,0,ckhhhqe,t3_2gawvm,t1_ckhhhqe,t3_2gawvm,null,1427027222,-1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-1

Was there really something turning the door? Is there really a monster under your bed? We can't know until we actually see it. But not seeing, not knowing, is what makes us afraid of the dark.

I know, some people might see this as a lame answer and they're disappointed that there isn't a reveal at the end of the episode, but it makes the universe much more mysterious and scary if there are things that even the Doctor doesn't know about and is afraid of.

The thing that differentiates them most for me is Hazard's work-rate (it's a lot higher that Cole's was), Hazard being better at counter attacks (mainly because he's quicker to pass the ball when we counter, and more precise doing so), and Hazard being more prone to run in behind defenders and being played through.

**Economic consequences of a surprise ‘Yes’ vote could be significantly negative**

What would happen if we are wrong and Scotland registers a surprise ‘Yes’ vote?

In the long run, we see little reason why an independent Scotland could not prosper: there is no evidence to suggest that smaller countries are richer or poorer, on average, than larger countries. However, in the short- to medium-term, the consequences of a surprise ‘Yes’ vote for the Scottish economy, and for the UK more broadly, could be severely negative.

The UK government’s position is that an independent Scotland would not be able to retain Sterling as its currency. Pro-independence campaigners argue that, in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote, the UK government would quickly change its stance because retaining a monetary union would be “overwhelmingly” in its interests.

However, in our view, the threat to disband the Sterling monetary union with Scotland is credible. One of the main lessons from the Euro area crisis is that a reasonably high degree of fiscal and/or financial integration is necessary, as a means of effective risk sharing, for a monetary union to work. Without political and fiscal integration, it is difficult to see the rest of the UK agreeing to provide a monetary and financial backstop to Scotland. A separate challenge for an independent Scotland is that it would face a significant budget adjustment if it is to put its fiscal position on to a more sustainable path. Under the terms of the existing ‘Barnett formula’ – a mechanism used by the UK Treasury to adjust the amounts of public expenditure allocated to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – public spending per head of population in Scotland is materially higher than in the rest of the UK, despite income per capita in Scotland being broadly in line with the rest of the UK. Scotland currently receives significant fiscal transfers from the rest of the UK and, given that it has an older demographic profile than the rest of the UK, the size of the net transfers from the rest of the UK to Scotland is likely to increase over time. Filling this gap in the event of independence would be painful and is likely to require a significant reduction in the provision of public services. In the long run, an independent Scotland would likely have a smaller public sector than would be the case if it maintained its union with the UK. An additional burden for an independent Scotland as it makes this fiscal adjustment is that, with no track record in the sovereign debt market and with institutions that are as yet untested, the Scottish government (and Scottish households and corporates) would likely face a higher rate of interest on their borrowing.

The consequences of a 'No' vote would largely depend on the size of the majority. If the majority is reasonably large (say, 5-10 percentage points or more), then the referendum is likely to draw a line under the issue for some time. However, if the majority is less than 0-5pp, there are likely to be moves towards greater Scottish independence within the UK ('devo max') and the process of seeking another referendum could start again reasonably quickly.",0,1410648277,null,0,1410648524,0,ckhi67h,t3_2ga73i,t1_ckhi67h,t1_ckh888a,null,1427026863,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,dreamtraveller,null,null,"First off, having a strong female character doesn't instantly classify that character as a 'mary sue'. Clara has her flaws, she's not the perfect character by any means and certainly not a self-insert - unless Moffat's not telling us some important biological facts about himself. Like you said, she's bossy and impatient. A Mary-Sue wouldn't demonstrate these qualities.

You say that the episode has a 'gimmick villain' and completely miss the premise of the episode itself - there isn't a villain. The whole point in the 'villain' is that we've all felt paranoia and fear at times in our lives when we've felt something watching us, following us or our daily routine being not quite right. The point in the episode was to show that even The Doctor has these fears and unlike the rest of us, who are content to accept that it's just the way things are - he was willing to go to any lengths necessary to prove he wasn't just paranoid, even to the point of creating a completely fictional creature. It's a demonstration of his ego, but more importantly a demonstration of his loneliness. Think of the parallels with Orson Pink. All alone, trapped in a box, a time traveller separated from his people. And so he begins to imagine monsters in the dark.

I don't personally like the direction the episode took - I personally would have preferred if it took the less cliché approach and there really HAD been a monster that has always been there listening each time you talked to 'yourself' - but instead Moffat decided on a well-paced and suspenseful episode which served to develop the characters of The Doctor, Danny and Clara.

On a final note, you're far too hung up on Clara. A lot of the flaws you see in her character seem almost entirely imagined.

You pull your clutch in and apply both brakes? That's going to increase your stopping distance at least 1/3, because of the no engine braking. You'll probably slam into the side of that car. 

If you apply both brakes you've got the engine braking helping you to stop. Not just that, but if you realise that you need to swerve instead of braking, you'll have more control. 

Try it. Go to a car park or someplace safe, roll around at 30mph, and then do a swerve just like your mod 1, do it twice, once with the clutch out and once with it in. You'll realise that you've got way more control with the clutch out.

Everyone predicting Scottish bankruptcy: a Scotland crippled by recession is in no one's interest, particularly not in the UK's, so I'm fairly confident that all the clever economic minds over in the City and beyond will figure something out, find a way to cope and quite probably even make quite a lot of money off Scottish independence. 

And as for the ones imagining a utopian land of social equality and prosperity for all, I assume a reality check will soon come, seeing as governance these days is much less about national issues and far more about international relationships. And if Scotland wants to attract investment, they'll have to compromise on domestic policies, which will leave a lot of people disillusioned. 

Still, considering the ideological differences between the two countries, independence makes the most sense to me. If anything, a successful Scotland with a different direction to the UK can perhaps steer UK's own political discourse back towards the centre a bit more. Scotland as part of the UK would always carry that 'you can only afford these policies because London subsidises you' tag. But that's just my personal opinion.

When Terrence O'Neill spoke of reform and change there was paisley stirring up hatred and rage and the equal and opposite reaction of hate and rage.... Maybe the troubles would have not been so bad or long without him but that is a what if that can now never be answered. 

As for the butcher boy, well again I know people here in Derry, staunch republicans, who feel McGuiness set up, was implicitly involved or aware of a set up that got Republicans killed yet preserved his own position which lead him to where he is now. Yet it seems in south Derry and in Tyrone he is loved. 

Ultimately the troubles was dirty and full of lies, double crossing propaganda and whattabouttery. Certain themes will be promoted in history by certain camps but there is no black and white as we all know full well in Norn Iron. Maybe if people who  agreed with Paisley didn't exist then people like McGuiness would not exist. But the past is the past and the two states in Ireland that existed during the 20th century are rapidly changing. I think our future is hopeful and if common recollection decides that the change began with the GFA and was cemented with the 'Chuckle brothers' (ignoring all the complexities that led up to it) then so be it.

The episode wasn't written so much to make us consider if the creature existed as it was written to make us realize that it doesn't matter. The Doctor is 2000 years old and relies solely on logic and yet in the end he still believed in a creature in the dark - the episode was a demonstration of his own fears and paranoias and gave him some more humanity after the more alien front we've seen him present thus far. The difference between the Doctor and us is that we accept that we'll never really know - whilst the Doctor will travel to the end of the Universe just to prove he's not going crazy.

Honestly, I would've preferred there to be a monster. The whole ""maybe there is a monster in the dark or maybe there's not"" thing has been done tons of times before. The part where the Doctor asked ""Do you ever find yourself talking to yourself"" had me in chills - the idea that we subconsciously know we're talking AT something and yet have no idea it's actually there is something that's never been covered before.

It is therefore doubly discouraging to see the BBC increasingly also going down the 'clickbait' path. Which I assume they do as their very existence has been under threat recently.

His effort today was outstanding. He was also ready for a rebound on the first goal and he got one the second time. He made several good through balls and he could easily have gotten an assist or two. If Adebayor had scored, we would still be wanking over that lobbed through ball by Eriksen.

I don't think it's a coincidence that we look really good when Eriksen has a good game and gets on the ball a lot. Most passes today and an astounding 91% pass completion.

Given that it's ""nothing like anything that has ever been done"" I don't know why you make that comparison.

Because eastern europe has been through much worse, had to do far more, and will prosper as time goes on due to the work if its people, because they are no less worthy or able of prosperity than the west. 
And Scotland, and even the rest of the UK, is no less able than the home counties, despite the magical thinking that rationalizes the current inequality. 

Change **might** be hard, but the future stretches far enough that you get to make it, not the oracular immaterial markets which have proven their short sight with disastrous consequences.

that statement is that ""he's made it childish""

I just dont understand this statement.  More Childish than Russel T Davis and his big green farting aliens, cute and cuddley aliens made of fat?  More childish than the talking robot dog?

I dunno but I think Moffat's episodes during the RTD era and his entire run as show runner has been far darker, aimed at a much older audience, more intelligent, more twists, turns and more to think about.

As you're only there for 5 months you'll pretty much have to find a short let somewhere as most student lets in the UK are July-July. I'm sure the university will help you, but it will almost certainly be with other students. Depending on the city, where in the city, size of accommodations, etc, etc, etc, you're looking in the general range of £200-£600 per month rent. I'd expect it to be a little less than £400 for my city.

Then, food. Students live frugally, as you mention. There'll be a lot of buying cheap food (and cooking larger communal meals if you get on well with your housemates). If you're planning your meals and being very frugal you can be spending less than £100 a month on food. Obviously, going out and/or buying nicer things will increase that.

A student's biggest outgoing is probably going to be going out drinking (legal drinking age is 18 here, people start going out drinking at about 13 or 14). I remember *one* night at university I spent £60. I remember lots of nights where I spent less than £10 and was utterly smashed. £300 will easily cover you a month.

There's always extra things, like travel, electricity bills, mobile phones, etc, but to be earning enough to have £22k for 5 months in the UK you'd be on an annual salary of £79k (before tax, remember!), which would put you in the top 5% of earners in the country.",0,1410650345,null,0,false,0,ckhj0py,t3_2gbol9,t1_ckhj0py,t1_ckhilrp,null,1427026350,3,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,3

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;No campaign canvassers in East Ayrshire found at least four children aged between three and 11 who were on the register and had received polling cards to vote. The child voters only came to light because their parents, who did not register them, alerted the No campaign.

If this is actual electoral fraud it requires that someone falsely registered a child as an elector **and** believed that they could divert the voting card.  This seems unlikely.  Electoral fraud happens, but this is just unlikely to succeed, surely?

On the other hand we live in a time where manufactured outrage is a daily occurrence.  Practically the easiest thing in the world though to register your own kid and then claim to be surprised, appalled, outraged that such a thing happened.

&gt;In Dundee, there were 3,649 young voters registered – 317 more than the actual number of 16 and 17-year-olds living in the city, according to 2014 population figures issued by the Scottish Government.

Dundee has two universities and at least two sixth form colleges.  *(It's possible I'm out of date and this has changed in the last twenty years, but)* Scottish kids often go to university a year earlier because of the way the Scottish education system works.  This is part of the reason a degree in Scotland takes a year longer.  

This would mean that a lot of 17 year-olds will have moved to Dundee in the last month or so.  While there would be an approximately equal outflow of students they wouldn't feature on the 16/17 year-old list.  

All in all...  Sure there will be some voter fraud - There always is.  But this...  This feels more like engineered outrage and reporting nothing as something than an issue.",0,1410651232,null,0,false,0,ckhjdta,t3_2gbogh,t1_ckhjdta,t3_2gbogh,null,1427026113,15,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,15

true,greenbyte,null,null,"It is interesting to compare that to placed bets, as people are usually more honest and realistic when they have their own money in the game. If one looks for the odds in placed bets, it still seems most probable that the result will be a no.

At ladybrokes, the odds for a NO are currently at 2/9 (or 11 : 9), that means that better guess a 50 : 50. The odds for a YES are only at 3/1, or 4:1. 

There is a catch - according to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Scotland/comments/2gaw65/hahaha_ladbrokes_has_suspended_betting_on_the/), no new bets are accepted because ""too many people bet on YES"" (95 %, in [other news 79 %](http://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/Independence-Debate/Punters-backing-Scottish-independence-11082014.htm)). This seems to hint at that more people believe in a success for Salmond, but it is well-known that the popularities of bets are often not good predictors.

What is interesting are **[prediction markets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market)**, because they adapt their odds automatically as people weight information, and they have been shown to adjust for the most probable outcome. They are less about gambling, and may allow people knowledgeable in one field actually to earn money. What's going on here is interesting, odds for YES seem higher there:

On iPredict, it is a share price of 0.27 (corresponding to a probability of 26.9 %) for a YES, but is has gone up temporarily to nearly 50 % in the last days:

https://www.ipredict.co.nz/app.php?do=contract_detail&amp;contract=SCOT.IND.2014

I found this one at predictious (an Intrade-style prediction market which operates using bitcoins):

https://www.predictious.com/politics#

https://www.predictious.com/politics/scottish-independence-referendum/no

That means the probabilities for a NO are currently 82 %, while the YES odds are 26 %.

Funnily enough, I consider personal ability and trustworthiness far more solid than predictions or projections, since the earlier is flexible to the unknown or unexpected, where the later die quick deaths. And since life is largely unknown or unexpected...

&gt;Nobody should make such a decision on the hope that everyone acts rationally and is brilliant.

&gt;Unfortunately, investors could not care less about the trustworthiness of Scotland unless they have the maths to prove it which they won't for many years and as aresult interest rates will increase and the currency will fluctuate.

Or they could see a modern economy with a desire for a trustworthy reputation and untapped ability to borrow and flood in. The market is about perception after all. That's what the talk of ""market confidence"" was about. And arguing that perception is only held by accurate mathematics misses the lesson of the last decade.

The thing is that the odds are fixed, which makes it difficult to match the personal chance/risk assessment with the price.

From TVTropes:
A ""bottle episode"" is designed to take up as little money as possible. The easiest way to go about this is to use only the regular cast (or even just part of the regular cast) and set it in a single location, especially if you have a main standing set. This keeps production costs down, because no one needs to scout locations, build new sets, or create fancy CGI graphics of the outside of the spaceship. Bottle episodes are often a chance for a slow, characterization-filled episode before/after a big special-effects-laden action episode. Of course, all this doesn't mean the episode will be cheap, just that it's meant to be; like any regular episode, unforeseen complications can cause the show to run over the scheduled budget.
Note that the term has become synonymous with ""single-location"" episode, even though bottle episodes can (theoretically) have as many locations as a normal episode. All that matters is that it costs less, because the money is having to pass through a ""bottleneck"".",0,1410654042,null,0,false,0,ckhkina,t3_2galg9,t1_ckhkina,t1_ckhgcdt,null,1427025388,-10,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,-10

Things to do: I don't know what interests you, but I recommend some historic sites, and places of natural beauty.

Avebury in Wiltshire is a Stonehenge-like massive stone circle. Unlike Stonehenge, there's a village in the middle of it, and there are no fences or visitor's fee. People can and do climb all over them. Stonehenge can be disappointing due to the over-regulation of visitors, but Avebury is amazing.

Windsor is a nice place for a day out - massive royal castle, pleasant old town and Eton College just over the bridge. A standard tourist destination, but a good day out.

London's practically a country to itself, hell of a lot to see. Get a copy of Time Out or the NME, check the gig guides, see some live music.

Oxford is very lovely and there's a hell of a lot to see there. You can wander round most colleges.

As an American you might be amused by the things we call ""mountains"" but there's some tough walks and climbs, especially in Snowdonia (Wales), the Lake District (England) and quite a lot of Scotland - I like the Cuillins, which you'll recognise if you've seen Highlander.

Purbeck in Dorset has small country villages, cliff paths, the stunning ruins of Corfe Castle, and some of Britain's nicest beaches in the south.

York is bloody cool. You might want to see a cathedral, and York Minster is great. Friendly place, lots of students, medieval city walls etc.

true,it_am_silly,null,null,"I'm at Herts Uni! Just about to start my second year, I lived on the de Havilland campus last year (most foreign students end up there).

• I'm going to be honest - Hatfield is boring and everything is grey. But you're 15 minutes from London by train and once you're there you only have to cross the road to get to Eurostar. If you do use Eurostar, consider getting a train to Canterbury (it's on the Eurostar line anyway) and spending a day there before continuing onwards, it's a beautiful city.

• The nearest places to Hatfield are Welwyn Garden City and St. Albans, which are both much nicer than Hatfield. St Albans is an old city with a lot of history - definitely worth the cheap bus fare to go there for a day. They're definitely the places to go if you want to experience a typical British pub, you won't find many good ones in Hatfield on a night out.

• With your budget, you don't need to worry about shopping costs at all, but if you want to save even more money, try shopping at Aldi. Most students go to Asda but Aldi is significantly cheaper - it's located behind the Galleria. Like I said, you don't need to with your budget (Most students only get ~£4k for a year).

• Don't rely on the local buses being on time. They're extremely unreliable.

• If you get a taxi in Hatfield, use AAA cabs. £2.50 from de Hav to the station (others charge £7+) and they have a great app for booking. Couldn't recommend them more.

• Don't forget to swipe your ID card in once a week, otherwise you could have loans/grants revoked.

• Please, please travel as much as you can. I don't want you to leave the UK thinking it's all like Hatfield!

If you have any more questions (UH/Hatfield specific or just general UK) feel free to PM me :)

Economically: We will take a large currency hit since none of the options being proposed are favourable for the Wider UK. It will get more expensive to travel and to buy products from abroad. There will be uncertainty for years to come. We're in the middle of a resurgence after the banking crisis, and the problems born out of such a fundamental split will likely stall or even reverse that.

Security: Scotland is home to our nations Nuclear Deterrent, Trident, and to much of the training grounds and air bases we use, as well as a couple of major Naval ports. It's also the quickest route into the UK from... Russia and places like that. If it becomes a separate nation we all have a huge headache - Scotland in negotiating a 'fair' share of military resources so that it can protect itself and become a viable entrant to NATO, and the UK because it will lose £Billions of hardware and assets. We will all pay the costs of this.

On the world stage, the UK will lose a huge amount of respect. If you can't stop 6 million citizens choosing to leave, what does that say about your domestic policies?

And more domestically, if Scotland go, this could be the beginning of the fragmentation of one of the worlds Superpowers. We have been in Peaceful Union (mostly) for centuries and the security this has brought lead us to punch well above our weight on the world stage. With Scotland gone, Wales, Northern Ireland, Cornwall, might decide that they too want to go it alone and free themselves from the Shackles of Westminster. With the Nation imploding, our influence and credibility on the world stage would be but a distant memory.

If Scotland goes, the impact will be hard to overstate, and it's my firm belief that everyone will be worse off in all possible metrics.",0,1410655296,null,0,false,0,ckhl1f8,t3_2gb4ba,t1_ckhl1f8,t1_ckhgrrn,null,1427025109,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

The classic series often refers to his time at the academy and that he belongs to the Prydonian chapter of Time Lords, who are notoriously devious. In ""The Sound of Drums"", the Doctor describes a Time Lord Academy initiation ceremony where, at the age of eight, Time Lord children are made to look into the Untempered Schism, a gap in space and time where they could view the Time Vortex. Some are inspired, some go mad \(as he suggests happened to his nemesis, the Master\), and some run away. When asked to which group he belonged, he replied, ""Oh, the ones that ran away; I never stopped!""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_\(Doctor_Who\)#Background)

Yeah! I've just found this group. my name is Susie Conning &amp; I founded the Houston Spurs supporters group when I moved from London to Houston in August 2013, my first memory of supporting Spurs in Houston was going to the Richmond Arms and walking into a sea of red! That particular days early game being shown was Man U v Liverpool followed by Spurs v Arsenal - I thought OMG where the other Lily whites, they're didn't seem to be many of us ?! At halftime I popped outside for a cigarette and met another Spurs fan, he told me it's always like this and someone needs to organize Spurs fans in Houston - so I did! We now range from 6 to 46 supporters who watch games at the Richmond Arms, we've just secured some marketing $'s from Carlsberg who are kindly printing Houston Spurs T shirts for us (anyone who wears this shirt will also receive a discount on Carlsberg beer at the Richmond Arms). Other Houston Spurs supporters have encouraged me to charge a membership fee so we can organize other supporter events - we're gearing up for the Arsenal game in a couple of weeks and will be there in force at our pre-match breakfast! Anyone who would like to join us would receive a very big Texan Lily White welcome.  Hey, I'm just a girl who can now walk into a pub on my own and be welcomed by fellow Yids - that makes my long suffering Boro supporter Husband happy as he now stay in bed when we have an early game!

A lot of that was pretty spurious, even if you believe the sources he has, most of it is 'the us etc gave money/guns/etc to and created the environment for suni islamists', but I don't think that any of these islamists were isis,  thought this bit was ok 
&gt;Since then, the role of the Gulf states – namely Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan (as well as NATO member Turkey) – in officially and unofficially financing and coordinating the most virulent elements amongst Syria’s rebels under the tutelage of US military intelligence is no secret. Yet the conventional wisdom is that the funneling of support to Islamist extremists in the rebel movement affiliated to al-Qaeda has been a colossal and regrettable error.

What's interesting is that most of the 'official' money and support seems to have gone to the Syrian Muslim brotherhood and the ('official' al queda affiliate) nusra front, these are different from and depending on the circumstances, in conflict with isis. 

Apparently they get most of their money in private 'charitable' donations from  rich  citizens of Saudi  Arabia and the Gulf states as well as robbery and kidnapping. I do think that they have exploited the general situation that the US created in Iraq, dissolving the army and creating a 'free trade' situation right after the war ended, but there were other actors involved aswell. imo the Iranians have been important in the rise of isis because they are partially responsible for the extremely  sectarian way that al maliki's has conducted himself (since the suni 'awakening councils' drove out Al-queda and other radicals), and the suni dissatisfaction with this was an important factor in undermining more moderate suni factions. isis exploited this.

As usual, because I am bias for and against various writers I will not find out who wrote this episode till the very end in order to protect the integrity of the review

[Episode Spoilers ahead](#s ""Ok so the episode starts out strong and raises a lot of questions. After the title sequence we find that Clara had a really bad date. So the Doctor takes her to the past to her dates childhood where we are faced with some unknown entity on young Rupert's bed. Possibly the same something that turned the television off earlier. We go back to Clara's date and it's still terrible. Next comes in Orson Pink (possibly Clara's descendant) from the future, the first human time traveler that got stuck on the very last planet. He is scared that something is outside his ship at night. Afterward, because of an unknown and apparent danger the TARDIS itself recognized, Clara takes the TARDIS right to the Doctors childhood and leaves him a message about fear. A toast to the War Doctor is made. We find out that same shed the War Doctor was going to the launch the Moment from was also his childhood hiding place. We go back to the modern era and Clara's love life is saved. Episode is a nice episode with a couple of twists and turns. However, it leaves questions unanswered. What was sitting on Rupert Pink's bed under the blanket? What moved the chalk earlier in the TARDIS? What was turning open the door from the outside of the human time traveling ship? It's like we are supposed to expect this entire time it was nothing, just fear of the dark, but something was definitely there. I give this episode 3 out of 5 stars. Nice atmosphere and idea with a great twist, but fails to explain or even face some of the events that took place in the very episode. Might adjust it later if we come to find out down the road this episode was relevant somehow. As it stands though, right now, it is a bit meh- even with the twist. Let's see who wrote it.

I wonder why nobody mentioned them before:

http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Silent

Is this because their ""magic"" works on the most true and ardent fans? :)

They was my first bet when Doctor started talking about ""perfect hiding"". It's propably my favourite race in Doctor Who. Their power fits perfectly the one that ""bed monster"" should have. It's also possible that Doctor and others saw Silents a lot of times in this episode. If one loses all his memories about all the Silents in the moment he loses sight of some of them, it explains why everybody (even Doctor!) believed that there is no enemy so easily.


Without them, this episode is just inconsistent.

true,kierdoyle,null,null,"Overall thoughts on the match: 

Defensively we have to improve, surely we'll be more solid in big games, but we're not going to score 4,5,6 goals every game and a clean sheet needs to become a more oft occurrence. I think Jose is gonna look at Luis and Azpi at left and right back respectively, because in the first half Taylor and Routledge absolutely shredded Schurrle and Ivanovic. Terry looked a bit off it today, and the communication at the back was shocking. Routledge had a volley come close where if Gaz calls JT off, the ball doesn't get flicked on (likewise with Courtois calling him off). The goal its the same thing, Azpi calls him off he clears comfortably. Obviously it's difficult when a ball is fizzed in, but just an improvement to be made.

Going forward we were lethal in the second half, around the 25 minute mark we started pressing really high up the pitch and made it very difficult for them to play out and it let us counter well. One of my favourite things I've noticed about Diego Costa so far, is if there's even a remote chance of us winning the ball, he's splitting the defenders looking to get in behind right away. Hazard really carried the game for the second half of the first half (awkward sorry), he was dribbling at players and drawing people to him, and really was the driving force going forward when we weren't clicking. (Note: Apparently he broke the record for most successful dribbles in a match, 16/18, the previous being held by the lovely Joe Cole with 14/16 or something).

Second half Ramires really was the catalyst for change. The extra man in midfield really made a difference, I found in the first half Oscar got caught chasing a lot, and Fabregas doesn't know how to tactically foul. Whereas Ramires will taking a booking if necessary, and stops them from building up a rhythm. He seems much smarter in terms of how he presses and when he challenges, and his decisions on the ball seem much less rash. Phenomenal stuff.

Diego's goals were all exactly the scrubby, poachers goals I was expecting him to score, but nobody would've gotten on the end of last year. Also Remy looked half decent when he came on, albeit after following a pretty phenomenal performance of DC, and against a quite deflated Swansea side, but still. Very well taken goal, his interplay looked alright, find he's not always in the box when he should be but that's judged off of 20 minutes. 

All in all, solid performance. Defensive improvement expected, offensive firepower bloody impressive, bring on Schalke.

Choking and stagnating where? Our economy took a hit in 2008, but it's on the mend now. The UK is still one of the greatest countries in the world by any metric. And Scotland has done pretty well out of that union.

* The ""thing"" under the bed sheet clearly looks non human even if it was burly, makes no sound entering the room or getting on the bed, and gets out of the room in a flash and makes little sound but they convince them selves it is just a kid.

* The ""thing"" outside the time ship at the end of time some how causes enough damage (or has the potential to cause damage) to the TARDIS to set off the [Cloister Bell](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/Cloister_Bell) something depressurization should not be able to do.

This whole discussion's actually gotten me thinking about how hard they screwed the pooch on the time war, because the way they made it out when they've briefly gone into how it was fought is that it's just a conventional war between races that could time travel.

But then I go back to how it started, with the Gallifreyan Black Ops sending the Doctor back to the Daleks creation in an attempt to either stop them from existing or change their basic nature to something less destructive, you know, actually fighting a war with time travel. 

So now all I'm thinking about is how cool it would be to have random battles appearing throughout the histories of all the races whilst they just attempt to defeat each other by fucking up their pasts, so the other side has to both beat them in a fight whilst trying to prevent it's own history from getting so fucked up that their present is irreparably damaged.

If Time Lords are anything like humans, they take hard things as challenges. Look at Mount Everest. Highest mountain on the planet and people climb it just because. There's no *reason* to climb it except that it's the highest thing and therefore a challenge.

The Time War is repeatedly said to have been time locked, and the War Doctor was about to end it. Given that the 9-11th Doctors believed it to have been time locked and ended by only the War Doctor, it's clear that he was going to time lock it forever, effectively killing them all.

From what I saw from the Day of the Doctor (and I rewatched it earlier today) it looks like the Moment does exactly what you want it to do, but it will a) try to talk you out of it and it and b) include a punishment for you (the War Doctor wanted to sort-of die along with everyone else, the Moment said you'll have to live). From a statement made by the Time Lord's war leader, the Moment was pretty successful at convincing people not to use it, and in fact convinced the Doctor as well, ultimately.

So the Moment isn't a simple bomb. I mean, why would a bomb even need an operating system complex enough to become sentient? Harnessing the power of an Eye of Harmony, on the other hand, was something that a sentient being (Rose) was able to do in order to do whatever she wanted. The link between the Eye of Harmony being harnessed and the Moment itself was emphasized by having Billie Piper play the Moment, in the shape of the Bad Wolf.

So, the box was to let people say ""hey Moment, I want you to do something"" and it would then warp reality so that it could read the user's mind and do the thing. It would be able to be used multiple times.

The box is probably somewhere in the TARDIS right now, and the Time Lords didn't blow up the Daleks with it because it convinced them not to, basically.",0,1410666289,null,0,false,0,ckhpl7j,t3_2gb92v,t1_ckhpl7j,t1_ckhp3lg,null,1427022610,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

This whole discussion's gotten me thinking about how cool it would be to have the whole time war fought like that: armies fighting in times and places where they don't belong in an attempt to ruin their opponents pasts to defeat them in the present, so then the opponents have to defeat the army that's fighting them whilst also preserving their past to enough of a degree that it doesn't destroy the future, kind of like what the Doctors did in Day of the Doctor actually. 

Idea's also inspired by how Douglas Adams described the effects of time travel in the Hitchhiker's Guide books, essentially it says that it's meant that history no longer makes any sense, which I think is an amusing concept that would be a lot of fun to play with, particularly in the context of a Time War, meaning a war where the main weapon IS time travel.",0,1410666357,null,0,false,0,ckhpm6h,t3_2gb92v,t1_ckhpm6h,t1_ckhpe89,null,1427022598,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

true,Story24,null,null,"I've been tossing this over in my mind since the episode aired and I think my problem with it lies in the beginning. I'm not saying that the episode couldn't be about something other than the monster (because if anything, Listen was a good exploration of what it means to be a soldier, with Danny seemingly being inspired to be quite a combative force, what with the Soldier Dan idea, and the Doctor, who is essentially a 'good soldier' who doesn't need a gun and tries to save everyone, being the alternative) but against all of that, against the exploration of Danny as a soldier and the Doctor's underlying fear that has inpired all of his adventures, was lost a very good monster that was actually set up really well.

At the start we have the Doctor talking aloud, theorising that a perfect survivalist could be present if their primary function was to hide. He explicitly says that, with their nature to hide, they would escape being a predator because nothing would know that they exist. They play off a monster existing in this 'invisible space' (behind your back, under your bed, only being sensed by the breath on the back of your neck or the noises in pipes and the breathing of a house) and set it up with the Doctor asking aloud why a creature would want to live constantly being hidden and it (at least implied with the Doctor not being able to remember himself writing it) responds with the message of that it would listen.

Isn't the idea of a monster that would constantly be hidden from us but hear everything we say to ourselves brimming with potential? Who knows what they would do with that information. Maybe they would influence us (like the Silents do with post-hypnotic suggestion) or maybe they just collect information to better survive, either way I thought the idea of a monster always being out of sight, but also always listening, could've really been explored, but instead it was used as an ambiguous vehicle to explore what drives Danny and the Doctor.

Again, not saying that the episode was bad, as Danny's drive to a soldier was established and the War Doctor's use of the cabin and the Doctor in general's ideals towards being afraid likely helped him escape the Time Lords to being with, which is what I assume Moffat's idea was with having Clara comfort an extremely young Doctor in his bed was all about, which is all good. But amid this there's a monster that had great potential and, in my opinion anyway, isn't explored or explained as much as it either could or should have been.

In summary: we get some really good character stuff here, but where's the monster that was sold as the driving force at the top of the episode? If the monster listens, why isn't this explored in the rest of the episode?",0,1410666428,null,0,false,0,ckhpn62,t3_2gc7ij,t1_ckhpn62,t3_2gc7ij,null,1427022585,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

So you're saying that because it's a fictional piece of work, you can ignore established facts from the fictional world in order to support your own beliefs (shippers do it all the time)? I guess that would explain the interpretations of most religions.

It's color of a sky in an imaginary environment doesn't mean anything for the real world, yes. But in the fictional world, it does.

In really brief terms, the coffee was kept really hot and McDonalds had had many reports of burnings, so they knew it was an issue.

The woman who was burned was elderly and sitting in a parked car in the passenger seat.  *(The first iteration of the story I ever heard was that she was driving and had the cup between her legs.  This is a pretty good example of how  nearly everyone knows the story, but a distorted version of it.)*  This part is never explained anywhere, but: When you remove the top of those cups they lose any structural integrity.  She opened it to add milk or sugar, spilled it and it practically flayed the flesh from her thighs and backside.

The family didn't sue looking for millions of dollars, they wanted McDonalds to pay some of the medical costs.  I forget the amount, but I think it was in the order of a few tens of thousands of dollars.

The jury in the initial case decided that since McDonalds knew full well that their coffee was scalding hot decided to award punitive damages.  These were based on something like the profits of one week's coffee sales.  *(The damages were greatly reduced subsequently.)*

For last season and the first couple of episodes, I gave her a pass for being the new companion.

However today it struck me that although I really want to like her, I just can't for two different reasons.

The first is that I feel like I fundamentally don't know who she is. Her background is really quite clouded. Amy was the little girl who waited, and ran off with the doctor just before she was to be married, etc. Rose was the girl working in a department store, who had lost her father at a young age, had a nosy father, and a sort of boyfriend. You similarly had a fair amount of detail on Donna and Martha. But for Clara, it feels like all you really know about her is that she's kind of a teacher.

Tonight's episode really put this into focus. You find out some of that background information on Pink, informing you about who he is, what his motivations are, etc. Within 10 minutes, you know more about him that you do with Clara after a number of episodes.

Clara is more of a ""Who"" than The Doctor is.

The problem then is that it's hard to do character growth on a character that has very little real definition.

The other issue (which may even partly be related to the first), is that I feel like there isn't chemistry between Coleman and Smith or Coleman and Capaldi. I'm not sure if this is the actress not really syncing up, or if it is partially from not being sure of who her character actually is.

Our squad is strong, well composed and Mourinho's tactics are paying off.

I am worried about our defense no being weak but being a bit small. Tbh, the lack of good defensive players is a issue faced by almost all the clubs. There is excess of midfielders at every club's disposal but very limited defenders. We are fortune to still have a few good young ones in the bag.

Also your analogy being good about most goals = title but think about what happened to Everton game, given we won it easily but Everton wasn't stopping and thats why we had to counter. Squad like Arsenal might not be that easy to stop. We cannot play in that pressure of you score, we score... Similarly there are other club who are equally challenging and there is a Di Maria and *FLACAO*... they get a opening they will try to close on to it.

true,BrowardSpurs,flair8,,"I don't have a problem with Kane for Adebayor, as I explained in my original comment. Really, it should have been ten minutes earlier. I don't really assign much blame to Kane for the own goal. The ball came through a bunch of players, so he couldn't see it well. But why was he on the far post, instead of at the top of the D, to take the ball out if we won possession? It should be a defender or midfielder on the far post.

I don't like the idea of making a defensive change so early when you're only up by a goal, especially Spurs, especially playing away, especially after we had already given away a bad goal earlier in the game. It's just asking for trouble, and it very often ends up like it did today. Our best offense has always been a good offense. The other problem with Stambouli for Chadli is that it totally changed our shape in a bad way.

Agreed Townsend would have been better than Lennon in this situation, against inferior opposition, chasing the win at the end of the game. But I still would have liked Eriksen on the field for those freekicks at the end.

The one thing I will say in Poch's defense, is that we as fans don't know exactly what condition the players are in, coming back from international break. Except for Adebayor, he was clearly out of gas. So maybe he felt he could only let Chadli and Eriksen have so many minutes.

This not only explains both of Capaldi's appearances, but also explains why the Doctor couldn't intervene against the 456-- he'd already tangled the time lines irreparably, similar to the situation with Amy and Rory in Manhattan.

Part of me is skeptical that this will be pursued in depth since it relies on small plot points from stuff that's several years old, but Moffat has proven himself a master of economical plot exposition, and it could probably be handled with a few lines of dialog and a couple of flashbacks.

You stick nukes on our land and claim we cannot support ourselves while your MPs privatize the public sector in their own interests. The very fact that you feel that way is why we need independence.

I am not Scottish and I do not have Celtic blood but Scottish independence is the best liberal political movement of the 21st century and I support it in every way. It may be headed by the nationalist party but that's because every other Scottish party is a puppet of the Westminster corrupt dogs. Salmond is a man of the people not a man of his own wealth. 
Scottish independence is far more about liberal and socialism than nationalism and if you had a drop of free thought in your tory brainwashed head you'd know the same. Its people like you we need independence from.

true,JimmyImpersonator,dalek,Dalek,"What we know about Clara:

- Her parents fell in love over a silly event involving a fallen leaf. It was a small happening but an extremely unlikely one, meaning that Clara herself came into being due to a serendipitous event.

- Her mother died young, leaving Clara's father to take care of her. During the funeral she and her father stood apart from one another, focusing on the grave rather than giving comfort to each other.

- She kept a scrapbook in which she noted down her hopes and dreams, including the dreams of traveling the world. The book was filled with dates and events - revealing that she is methodical - but also pictures and scribbles, revealing that she is creative. 

- She had to postpone her dream of traveling for the sake of helping her good friend who had lost his wife young and had to raise his kids alone, probably reminding her of her father.

-  In general she is willing to sacrifice a lot for a good friend, including her own existence. This led to her becoming the Impossible Girl so that she could watch over her best friend in the world, the Doctor. 

- She is good with children individually, but not that much with large groups like in a classroom. 

- She works as a teacher and loves her job.

- She can be bossy and controlling with temper flairs when things escape her control or don't go as she wants.

- She's funny, likes to joke around. If someone begins a joke she will happily play along. 

- She is flirty and, according to Strax's mental scan, fond of imagining something that 'might' be naked men wrestling. (Clara into hot-men slash confirmed!)

- She has a mouth that has a life of its own, blurts things out when excited and when nervous can get tongue-tied and lose her voice. (Happened both with Pink and when a classroom full of kids were acting out against her)

- Above all she is brave. If I had to pick one thing to be her character's 'thing' it would be her courage. She'd get terrified, but even then she'd be in control of her fear, able to reason within the bad situation and find a way out without losing her nerve.

Not trying to prove you wrong or anything, just trying if at all possible to help you fill the blanks. I think we know as much about Clara as we do about any other companion. Rose: she worked in a shop, lived with her mum and had a boyfriend-but not called Mickey. Martha: was a doctor, had a mother, father and two siblings (was it two? I think it was two). Donna: Temp, mother and a grandfather. The only companion we knew comprehensively since their childhood was really Amy and to some extent Rory. All others we knew as much as, if not less than Clara.

Why are so many people getting confused over this? There definitely was something on the bed. There definitely was something outside the spaceship (although all reason said there shouldn't have been; that said, the Doctor was wrong when he said only that planet was left, as there was clearly a swollen red giant star in the sky.)

However, what drove The Doctor to investigate this in the first place is a nameless dread he has which was caused by the encounter at the end of the episode. There is no way that said event could have caused everyone to have the same dream - therefore at least that part of the story stands as somewhat separate from the Doctor's fear of the dark under the bed.

The episode switched tracks about halfway through - it stopped being about the monster (which almost definitely existed) and started being about the Doctor and his motivations. That's clearly the theme of this season - we're learning who the Doctor is and why he is the way he is.

I laughed. 

&gt;  The new Scottish government would have to severely tighten fiscal policy to establish credibility 

Not according to all of the credit agencies *and that's what matters*. All of the doom and gloom they extrapolate from that (e.g. needing a trade surplus) doesn't follow. And it's doubly bullshit as Scotland will have a trade surplus to begin with anyway! 

&gt; both the fiscal and external positions would be hugely dependent on the vagaries of volatile oil prices.

No economists view a 20% of GDP on a single industry to be ""hugely dependent"", that's just tripe. *And* that's worse case, the true figure will be around 10%-15%. 

Plus with more and more war in the middle east and the rise of China/India's industrial eras the supply/demand for oil dictates that higher prices are almost certain.

&gt; Some people say, with justification, that Scotland invented the modern world. What is not mentioned, however, is that the vast majority of Scottish inventions came after the Act of Union in 1707. Of course this was due to the industrial revolution that followed union in the 18th and 19th centuries. But such a technological revolution was only possible because of the synthesis of Scottish brains, English coal fields and British colonial markets.

Wait, was this written by **a bank** or by Better Together themselves?

true,DrumminOmelette,null,null,"Story time:

Didn't bother me, infact I loved my uniform, looked really professional, the high school senior uniform especially, we had a unique tie, separate from the younger years, ours was turquoise with a gold stripe at the bottom and the schools badge above it, the younger years was plain burgandy with the school name in gold at the top, and only seniors years were allowed to wear a blazer, which basically every senior did since it was like wearing nothing at all (nothing at all!) in comparison to the school jumper, plus it actually looked badass as fuck. School trousers were nice and comfy, airy, and now double as a pair of decent suit trousers (bargain)

I appreciate how Harry Potterish this following paragraph or two will sound but honestly this is what it was like at my school. Prefects got little gold &amp; red badges with the word prefect on it if they were prefects (obviously) and head boy/girl &amp; deputes got unique badges, our school also had a house system (3 houses) where people got a circular badge with the colour of the house (gold, burgundy &amp; turquoise respecively), most people didn't wear them but for whatever reason seniors almost always wore them (its almost as if the people staying past the minimum leaving age liked their school or something).

I wasn't a prefect, but I bought a cheap as shit near identical badge that said ""Perfect"" so I could be all hipster and stuff (cringe) and hang out with the prefects as the rules were all pupils had to either be in their common rooms (senior common room was amazing: fridge, microwave, kettle, 2 nintendo 64s (smash bros or mario kart yesplz), a PS2, actually comfy seats, big tables), dinner hall or be outside the school building during morning &amp; afternoon breaks. The doors into the building were locked during these breaks and could only be opened from the inside of the building so prefects were there to make sure noone was wandering corridors during these times, or to escort people to toilets and then kick them out afterwards (we were known as a particularly rough school so prefects were pupils that teachers could trust to keep pupils behaving properly) I probably could have gotten away with being inside, I was one of the geeky types, so most teachers would have let me off, but for the odd arsehole teacher I could say look I have a badge (you twat).

Some other people did similar stuff to express individuality (bought badges for their blazers) but most people expressed it through choice of bag/coat/shoes as these weren't enforced by the school, except the rule that you had to take coats off during class, and technically trainers weren't allowed but teachers didnt give a fuck about what shoes people were wearing, as they couldn't exactly tell every teenager in the room to take their shoes off without some of them going ape shit. 

Everyone ignored the schools gym kit policy and teachers didnt give a fuck about that either, infact they probably understood why: bright burgundy shorts and sky blue top (ugh fashion disaster), and worse for swimming: black or navy skin tight trunks (or 1 piece swimsuit for girls), no swimming shorts.
Though If you didn't bring some form of kit, they would give you a spare kit, so either horrible school coloured gym wear with a nice shitty pair of shoes (sketchers or some other laughable brand :P) or a size too small pair of black speedos for swimming and not the shorts/jammer kind, the brief/yfront kind. So that kind of made sure people brought their kit to avoid embarassment. The only way to get out of PE was to outright refuse the kit, and get a ""punny ecky"" or written punishment exercise to be signed by parents or getting sent to a depute head teacher depending on repeat offenders as a result, or to bunk off, and if caught you ended up with a similar outcome, more than likely sent to the headteacher, and ironically excluded.",0,1410674076,null,0,false,0,ckhs7i9,t3_2g9wt0,t1_ckhs7i9,t3_2g9wt0,null,1427021388,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

I hated her when I knew that she would replace Amy, but I've liked her since I saw her Victorian

Unlike most people on here, I'm starting to dislike her. Danny Pink was an unnecesary addition to her storyline. I hated how Amy was converted into an oven for River Song in the previous seasons and I hate how Clara will most likely end up with Danny and be the great-grandmother of Orson. I don't think it fits with her strong, independent personality.

Why must every companion have some big fancy storyline or ending? I was perfectly happy with Clara.  Her role as the impossible girl was fine. I thought it was over. Now she will struggle with her love life and with her role as a companion and it just feels like unnecessary drama. If she leaves in the Christmas special, I hope it's not for some stupid reason.

The best thing for me today was our intensity.  So much has been said about how shit we were at the start of matches last season, but this year we've looked hungry and intense from the off.  Popping the ball up the pitch, and gamely battling for it from the very kick off.  Far cry from last year.

Plus, even though we've got various parts of the team not fully clicking yet, you can tell players are giving their all.  Lamela, Eriksen, Dier, Capoue, Dembele... they all busted a gut today.  Good from the perspective of the high press, and even better that it seems like players are really working hard for the new manager already.

Still, I'm concered about our options up front.  Ade can be great, but he's positionally clueless.  He almost never seems to get himself in good positions in the box where he can receive from Lamela or Eriksen.  Drops too deep and either tries to play tiki-taka or do it all himself, neither which he's really suited to.

And I still reckon Rose is super-iffy.  I have heart palpitations any time someone passes him the ball whilst he's under the slightest modicum of pressure.

Lamela worked super hard today, but I get the feeling like he's working a little *too* hard.  Trying stuff that isn't really coming off, and not focusing on the simple stuff enough.  Contrast him to Eriksen - different player, yes - and you'll notice than Christian's game is really very simple most of the time.  He just picks his moment to do the flick, the chip, the beautiful pass or turn, instead of trying it every time he gets the ball.  He plays much more assuredly, whereas you feel like every time Erik gets the ball, he's trying to prove something.

Whereas Eleven was a man for lying and moving on from past hurts, Twelve is ready to ruminate and delve into his mind in a brutally honest fashion. 

Eleven said to others, ""Nothing's wrong. Shut up and let me focus on this puzzle."" 

Twelve says, ""I'm bothered by this thing and it terrifies me, and I can't escape it."" 

He worries about integrity, and he worries about whether or not he's a good person. Eleven would have glossed over all of this in an instant, and he repeatedly did. Only for his inner conflicts to come out in sudden displays of manic-depressive rage. He went from grinning to pointing guns at peoples' heads and threatening his loved ones in the TARDIS. 

As follow-up, Twelve is more of a melancholy and encumbered type of man around the clock. He's troubled and haunted, and he has no qualms about letting the world know it. He doesn't expect others to cater to his pain, but it doesn't upset him for others to know he's undergoing a very big struggle.

As for my own. I think Smith, unlike Tennant, was ready and accepting of a final death before he was given another regeneration (possibly more).

We have to review - with a metric fuckton of analysis and paperwork - the merits of a case before we even pass it to our panel solicitors thinking it has a good chance of success; and even then they might return it to us saying 'nope!'

Unite the Union does assist members with paying for their members cases (again, following the above exhaustive steps) but that legislation has a particularly spiteful clause in that means we can't outright pay for them (because that would mean in effect the union is paying for the claim - and we can't have that now, can we - it has to be the individual) so we have to get the member to take out a loan, and we then assist with those payments.  Really - it's specifically done like that so we CAN'T help people.  

Get that point - we want to be able to help underwrite them, that's what member's money should be used on - but we can't because the law has specifically been designed so that people CAN'T get assistance in paying for them, so they WON'T get assistance.

Still have to wonder what was under the blanket. It could have been ""nothing"", but everything thing about it was clearly made to seem like it definitely was not just someone pulling a prank. Then there is the fact that the Doctor is adamant he did not write *listen* on the chalkboard, plus the knocking on the door. Some of the Doctor's evidence is explained away (like his own dream and the other noises) though. I think there was something there. Something that maybe isn't everywhere like the Doctor thinks, but instead is something the Doctor brings with him. In the end though it doesn't really matter because the episode was about the Doctor's fears particularly the unknown. The Doctor is probably the most curious person ever to the point it is almost a curse. 

On a bit of a side note I have to say that I am enjoying Capaldi very much. He reminds of House in some ways (good ways). He was basically willing to die to solve the puzzle (sound familiar). Plus he seems a bit more straight forward (I wont say honest because everybody lies) than the other Doctors. He is actually kind of rude. Freaking wide face with bad makeup.

Orson just looked like he recognized her somehow and naturally trusted her.  I think these things are not Red Herrings.  I'm willing to bet that every single thing which was unanswered in this episode - the bedsheet monster, origin of Orson Pink, etc, will be come major plot point in future episodes.

You're absolutely right that it's big news and could well be a point in history. It's a big thing.

Those who vote yes will do so because they want to. Those who vote no will do so because they want to. The posting of sample size poll results - here - before the actual event - achieves nothing but to say ""I went on the internet and I found *this* poll which is contrary to *that* poll"".

Yes, your scenario could theoretically happen.

It's also theoretically possible that every person in the UK will decide to walk into the sea tomorrow, all bar from four confused Polish men and one English woman from Southampton. The UK could become a nation where home nationals are a minority!

&gt; I'm just playing devils advocate here, but this who thing has been so poorly organised by everyone involved, from Holyrod to Westminster.

I don't think it really has. The UK supports dual-citizenship with every country on earth, the vast majority of people in Scotland will take up Scottish citizenship (bear in mind that in the last census, 62% of people felt their national identity was ""Scottish only"", not ""Scottish and British"" or ""British"") too, and people will simply have two passports.

That's not a new or unique situation, it's an entirely predictable outcome from Scotland becoming independent. Within a few generations this dual-citizenship will start to fade away, and eventually Scotland/rUK will share the same kind of relationship as Ireland/UK do today.

&gt; Why you may feel its insane, I suspect that if his views are driven by tribal allegiance, then others are too.

Oh, of course. And as an old firm supporter he's probably more likely to feel ""tribal allegiance"" than the norm (which isn't to say that all Rangers/Celtic fans do, but a substantial number do).

The insanity really comes from the idea that the SNP are ""selling dreams to Irish Catholic descendants"" (presumably he means Celtic supporters), or that they would launch a violent coup to overthrow the UK government (presumably he means against the UK government, as it seems unlikely the Scottish government would launch a coup against themselves).",0,1410685610,null,0,false,0,ckhupv1,t3_2gcroh,t1_ckhupv1,t1_ckhufz7,null,1427020207,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

My theoretical scenario includes the important bridge of negotiations going poorly, which I think changes the context from a wild hypothetical to something more conceivable. During the 2 year negotiation period, if it became abundantly clear that SNP had sold a dream and fucked it up, could there be widespread rejection in protest?

&gt;or that they would launch a violent coup to overthrow the UK government...

Sorry if I gave the impression of violent coup. There is a referendum and that was the context. 

What I was poorly trying to explain was that the SNP have their own goals. I think its fair to say that economics have been the weak point of their manifesto, and part of their campaigning has been to play to demographics who would not normally vote.

In broad terms, considering that Rangers are seen as unionists and aligned with NO, the SNP have been able to use the sectarian divide to tap into a demographic who would normally not vote.

I mean what did these people think ISIS fighters were doing during the Iraq war before the Assad thing blew up?

They sure as hell weren't sitting there playing with kittens, they were in Iraq killing our soldiers and murdering Iraqi civilians.

Ignorance of the law is no excuse, anyone who joins a terror group should be dealt with according to the law if they return. The issue is though do we really want them put in with the rest of the prisoners? The last thing we need is more radicalisation in the prison system.

true,mojojo42,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"&gt; During the 2 year negotiation period, if it became abundantly clear that SNP had sold a dream and fucked it up, could there be widespread rejection in protest?

I don't think so, no. People are not voting for the SNP.

&gt; What I was poorly trying to explain was that the SNP have their own goals. I think its fair to say that economics have been the weak point of their manifesto, and part of their campaigning has been to play to demographics who would not normally vote.

I think they would dispute both of those points, but clearly every party has their own goals in mind.

I have no doubt whatsoever that, in the event of a Yes vote, both Scottish Labour and the Scottish Conservatives will relaunch themselves as ""best for Scotland"" parties and make their own proposals for how an independent Scotland should work.

Some of those proposals will be more popular than the SNP equivalents, some less so, but deciding which of those the electorate favour is what elections are for.

&gt; In broad terms, considering that Rangers are seen as unionists and aligned with NO, the SNP have been able to use the sectarian divide to tap into a demographic who would normally not vote.

I don't think so, no. By far the largest demographic who would not normally vote are those in poverty who feel completely disconnected from the normal political process.

The reason that they're voting now is not that the SNP has promised them a land of milk and honey, it's that groups like RIC or Yes Scotland have [gone and talked to them](http://radicalindependence.org/2014/08/19/radical-independence-campaign-18k-canvass-sample-released/).

No mainstream party had volunteers setting up trestle tables outside job centres asking people if they'd registered to vote, and if not would they like to. RIC/etc did and that's a large part of the reason why registration is at 97%.

If you're reading about the referendum through the filter of the BBC/Telegraph/etc then this kind of phenomenon is simply not reported. It's a far easier narrative to say ""the SNP are making promises that they can't keep"" rather than ""many people voting yes have never voted for the SNP nor do they have any intention of doing so"".

&gt; ""My wife was in the chip shop and the 16 year old girl behind the counter told her that she was so excited she couldn't sleep. This girl couldnae even spell fish, let alone understand a mortgage, but she can vote.""

I assume he's not arguing that those with a poor education shouldn't be allowed to vote.

If he is arguing that 16 year olds shouldn't be allowed to vote, the reason they can vote in this referendum (and future elections, assuming a Yes vote), is that the [age of legal adulthood is 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Legal_Capacity_(Scotland\)_Act_1991) in Scotland rather than 18 in the rest of the UK.

The overwhelming bulk of the economy is here, the Tories can still be beaten at the next election without the Scottish Labour voters, England has discovered its own massive supply of natural gas that's much cheaper to extract than most of the remaining North Sea oil supply and if the yes voters think they're going to get a disproportionately large share of the public sector's resources they're going to be in for a shock when the Tories realise they're choosing between being fair to the departing Scots and being unelectable for a generation.

A side note, I and everyone on the yes side I have spoken to agree that devolution needs to be across all areas in the UK to be a success.

It's well worth doing as you get some time on the bike for nothing and it will stand you in good stead when you do the CBT. Obviously the schools hope you'll book a CBT with them so it may be worth waiting until you're ready to do the CBT.

While the Moment does question why he chose to walk so far before trying to use it(To escape the TARDIS's sight) it could also be that he was merely looking for somewhere on a deserted planet with which to activate The moment. Since Deserted gives him the advantage of potentially not hurting innocents while also being less likely to be detected.

The Doctor had to die on the beach in series 6. At least in the capacity that he did. To the extent that it created an aborted timeline that caused everything to run amok. Until the point where they performed the actions required to correct it.

So by virtue of there actually being set point's in history. Gallifrey timelocked or not can't be changed.

Which could also be the reason that the TARDIS was able to travel back to that point in time. Because technically according to the Time Lock and the necessities there in, it already had travelled there, it was a past and future event. Just as technically speaking if you can't TARDIS into gallifrey none of the doctor's before TWD should have been able to either. Since gallifrey is timelocked regardless.

A lot of what you said boils down to personal interpretation of the characters to which I think I have the right as much as you do. I definitely do not see Clara as a deity on the show and if I said that I liked that she was sometimes stern with the Doctor that doesn't automatically mean I think that no other Companion has done it before. They have and I liked it then too.

I don't see how it matters which Companions I liked before, but I've liked all of them except that I wasn't a HUGE fan of Martha because she fell in love too fast.

And you've completely misunderstood the focus of my Companion-breaking remark. The focus wasn't on Clara, it was on the Doctor himself. 12 is the beginning of a whole new cycle of regenerations. Previously - in new-Who, at least - all the regenerations were variations of the same character. 9, 10 and 11 were all their own characters, but they were the same person - energetic, adventurous, *mostly* in high-spirits and pretty fond of hugging and positive emotions.

12, on the other hand, is the closest the Doctor has come in new-Who to being a whole separate new person from his previous regeneration. His memories are jumbled, he's now grouchy, he's dismissive of companionship unless it benefits him, he's against hugging and he *hates laughter*. He resembles the First Doctor in many ways, honestly. So since he's almost a new person, he's re-learning a lot of things, including what a Companion is and how to treat them properly. 

That's what I believe Clara is teaching him.

Two options:

1. The rather vague and apparently non-aggressive monster who moves your stuff when you put it down and turn your back. Seriously, aside from hiding really well, it's not even claimed to be a predator.

2. Another child, who happened to be out of bed, snuck into the room without being noticed, hid under the covers, didn't react to the very odd conversation, then *quickly* ran out of the room after being a little weird.

Seriously, if it *actually* was a kid trying to frighten Rupert, then it was a kid who had impeccable timing, and was amazingly good at taking advantage of odd conversations with complete strangers. In the real world, kids who are scared of monsters under their beds are rarely strategic geniuses who could have pulled off a prank like that.

On the other hand, if its master skill is ""hiding"" then ""being a large heavy lump under the bedcovers"" actually wasn't all that clever, especially when it clearly runs very quickly, even if it's a child stealing a blanket.

But in some ways, it doesn't actually matter, and I would be surprised if we ever get a definitive answer.

I quite liked ""The Empty Child"". There's been a few other ""nursery rhymes in a minor key are so creepy, right?"" episodes that weren't bad.

Danny and clara have children and Orson recognizes Clara as his great great grandmother or something similar and he can't reveal that knowledge because changing the past and paradoxes so orson and danny are descendants of the doctor.
Orson also said time travel was in the family again could be referring to Clara or the doctor.

sorry if it's a bit all over the place but with the whole war doctor barn scene i'm 95% sure it's the doctor who receives the soldier from Clara because of the people saying he would never be a time lord and the fact the child was white and not dark skinned like danny.

This whole episode is about misdirection based on faulty assumptions all grounded in fear. You think there's a monster, so you start to see things as ""it's the monster doing this!"" 

Hell, given that Clara basically instills this fear into the Doctor, it's pretty clear there never was a monster. No one under the bed, no one making those noises.

I used to work in a huge office like the one pictured, bang in the middle of the room with the only natural light coming in from small windows on the other side of the room. It was soul crushing, noisy with people walking back and forth to meetings.

Now my new job, while an open plan office, is much better designed. It doesn't feel like there are desks going on for miles. There are two banks of desks, then a huge space in the centre that looks down to the atrium and more desks on the other side of that, with meeting rooms in at strategic points. The windows are floor-to-ceiling too so plenty of natural light and a good view outside. 

EDIT: Also Paxman's complaint is about the BBC's hotdesking policy, which isn't universal across the organisation as far as I'm aware and not many business adopt it either. The nature of Paxman's job is quite ephemeral, he doesn't need a fixed desk, he can work wherever he likes.

I agree with the other 12,000 posts, it definitely had a ""Midnight"" feel, but didn't get me to that point of clutching the blankets in fear the way that Midnight did. Love the cutesy date with Clara and Dan the soldier man. I laughed when she went back in to fix it, only to make a mess of it again, instead of a straight up happy ending. Very human, and I like the sparks that fly in their conversations, instead of straight up sappy dialogue. And lastly, really enjoying the Doctor teasing Clara like a big brother/little sister relationship.

I for one think that a big shock of any kind is exactly what the UK Westminster government needs. They have forgotten who they work for.

Absolutely it's an oh shit thing but it will have been a back pocket option for a while and I don't see that it is any more or less likely to happen because of being an oh shit option. Cameron may well not favour federalisation and he may well have valid reasons for that - however much of a prick and career politician he is he probably has more insight into the question than most of us. But I'm sure he'd prefer federalism the country to seeing Scotland go.

I think you should be far more worried about chips in the next UK election if it's a yes. The whole terms of separation, including the currency union question, will become topics for the election and - probably - become differentiators between parties. Signs are a majority of the English (the poll I saw was specifically England) don't want a currency union, so the parties will have to take that into account as a starting point and then the debate and discourse will go where they go. Or where the media take them

Its only one thing - but I was out yesterday at a thing in England and a Scottish guy was working. He was giving directions and made a mistake so there was some laughter and banter both ways.

The guy who'd asked then said we'll fuck you then and walked away looking fairly irate and talking to his mates about it.

The Scots decided to establish a colony on the isthmus of Panama, territory already claimed by Spain. They then tried to raise the finance for it in European capitals including  in England. These attempts were blocked by various governments keen to avoid antagonising the powerful Spanish. Scots then resorted to raising the money domestically, however this amounted to about 25% of their GDP at the time.

The scheme set sail in two batches about 10 years apart, but was ultimately brought down by poor planning, disease, conflicts with the Spanish and most importantly by a failure to successfully make a trade route across the isthmus... Connection the east and west coasts of the Americas. 

Financial overexposure to the scheme decimated the already weak Scottish economy and was one of a several factors that would later encourage a union with England. 

The Darien scheme was Scotland's failure alone. Thousands of the settlers died and few that survived ever made it back to Europe. The scheme itself was over ambitious and failed to take into account the difficulties in local conditions. They were then beset by problems they had not fully anticipated - like the reluctance of local colonies and native populations to trade with them, out of fear of a Spanish reprisal against them.

true,melakafray,null,null,"&gt; The goals we've been scoring have been nice, but unless we get the defence sorted we will be massively found out against the bigger teams, and in the Champions League.

I honestly don't think Jose will play with the same tactics when it comes to the bigger teams. If we're up against a side with a strong attack like Man City, I can see him starting with Ramires in defensive-mid alongside Matic in place of one of our attacking mids (Most likely Schurrle or Willian, because I think Fabregas would just play in front of our two DMs) as Rami is a lot better/faster at getting back for defensive duties than, say, Schurrle for example. 

I can also see him telling Ivanovic to not go forward as much because it leaves a gap in defense and, if Azpi happens to go forward on the wing too and the opposition suddenly counters, it's difficult for Cahill and JT to cover for both 'holes' in the defense (with help from Matic and Rami, of course). I haven't seen enough of Luis to know what he's best at but if Jose thinks he'll cover us more defensively against bigger teams, then I can see him being put on at LB instead of Azpi, with Azpi either on the bench or at RB in Brana's place.     

**TL; DR** Jose will change the team/tactics based on who we're playing and the players we have available. We won't always be attacking so much, which won't leave as many gaps in the defense and hopefully means we won't concede as many.",0,1410695383,null,0,false,0,ckhwbzi,t3_2gbk37,t1_ckhwbzi,t1_ckht7sj,null,1427019453,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

Long and short of it; 

*Size* of economy isn't necessarily what you should be looking at, balance of trade is because the further you drop into a trade deficit it's a domino effect on pretty much everything.

Right now the UK runs a trade deficit of 4.4% and in that situation what *should* happen is the value of the currency drops until the deficit evens out. However the UK has sustained the deficit by borrowing. Why? Because we have a **huge** financial sector that relies on a strong pound. 

Without Scotland on the books however, specifically without North Sea Oil exports the trade deficit drops to 7%.

true,Carlswaen,null,null,"I was picking up on the most pertinent point, and omission is not evidence of support, but I'll happy revisit the other points.  It does however remain that you're way off on the one point I raised so far.

&gt;**I don't believe we need more aircraft carriers.**

Actually yeah.  I do.  UKIP were the one main party that was opposed to the Afghanistan occupation, Iraq, Libya, Mali, bombing of Assad in Syria.  They warned BEFORE the protests sprung at Christmas that EU foreign policy was running a dangerous course with a dangerous opponent in Ukraine - so it's not like they're the belligerents ([**Farage actually warned about the foreign policy with regards to Ukraine as far back as 2008**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEyWWZrDoTg)).

We have an international obligation to help with escalating piracy.  The government has a duty to keep trade routes open.  The Med States themselves are crying out for assistance in dealing with the mass refugee boats.  People are dying.  The EU's own border and security control isn't just failing, it has critically failed.

Added to that military operational ability is essential to independence if a country does not want to be beholden to another's foreign policy to bolster their own forces.  If you rely on other militaries to supplement your own capability then you do have to pay the piper and cooperate with them more in their own operations.  Having a strong navy means being able to have a truly independent foreign policy - and hopefully never having to use it.

So aircraft carriers?  Yes.  There's an incredibly strong case once you start looking at it in more detail.  Arguably helicopter based carriers as the Russians tend to use would be more pertinent, but in recent(ish) years you only have to look at British operations in Sierra Leone, evacuations of British citizens from Libya, Sudanese piracy, illegal deep sea dumping in international waters off Liberia, the civil war in Yemen and its potential to close down crucial supply lines in the Arab Sea, and the growing third world refugee crisis across the Med - and deployable air support capability becomes an obligation.

&gt;**I don't believe that cutting council tax and improving services is actually a feasible policy.**

You think councils are running at 100% efficiency?   

Because that's what the private sector calls that.  Efficiency.  You can actually lower a lot of the councils costs in a stroke which it could then pass on and use to improve services.   Want an example?  Scrap the land fill tax which councils are charged.  It costs councils a small fortune, they have to tax people more, and it leads to fly tipping.  It also costs local businesses as they pay to dump refuse, so its not just councils and the residents that would do better.

Want another example?  That lady in Rotherham that was in charge of adoption and child services that took children from the UKIP foster couple.  The same woman whose department was using a taxi company they knew to have a history of sexual molestation (to the point of telling its employers to take down car number plates if they themselves  use it), the services which were sending molester-cabs to pick up children from their homes for the NIGHT.   

Well that woman was on £160,000 per annum.    
I'm pretty sure we can get someone with lots of management experience wanting to supplement their pension at a fraction of that, who isn't a bigot, and who isn't okay at turning a blind eye at the systemic rape of kids.   Going out on a limb I think we can get someone with plenty of experience that is interested in topping up their pension, for lot less, who wants to do the job for the rewarding nature of the work that the job *should* be - I also think we'd be well within our rights to expect an ""anti-molestation policy"" in the successful candidate.

I'm absolutely certain that we don't need six figure salaries at council level.  Convinced of it   I'm also pretty confident we can expect more.

[**I'm absolutely positive that Lancashire County Council doesn't need 50 people on 6 figure salaries.**](http://www.lep.co.uk/news/local/crime/community/50-council-bosses-on-100k-plus-1-6770142)

This lobby group thinks that there might be [**2,000 council workers on 6 figure salaries.**](http://www.politicshome.com/uk/story/43637/many_council_staff_still_on_six_figure_salaries_tpa.html)

I'm not opposed to six figure salaries at the very top levels of civil service or in the private sector, I'm not even opposed to them getting the odd little free junket at a council level, but there's nothing at a council level that justifies those salaries.  They're clerks.  Administrators.  Middle management. Not business brokers, legal savants, or generals of science and industry.

Efficiency.   You can improve service and cut costs, especially if you're talking about services that are under performing, being wasteful, and in some cases (Rotherham) have been operating with no sense of  oversight.

I find it absolutely strange that anybody would try to argue that councils are as efficient as they're ever going to get.

&gt;**I don't believe that we should leave the EU**

Yeah, I'm okay with that.  I don't believe meaningful reform is possible other than in the direction of EU federalism.  I believe the Eurozone countries are now committed to some quite severe concessions which they might not otherwise have wanted.  I'm specifically thinking about the [**European Stability Mechanism**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZZMXNr95Zs) and the way it is collateralised.   I don't see any public mandate for federalism, and that the UK cannot follow where the Eurozone states are obliged to go and that the Union itself, combined with deflation in member states, is essentially divergent.

The UK offers to manage your assets for you in a way that we think will benefit the United Kingdom.

We will take control of your tax system and collect all your taxes. 
We will decide how best to spend those taxes with the exception of a few which we will let you control yourself.

When there is an international issue we will decide which wars to fight and which ones not to. 

We want to be part of the nuclear armed world but we don't want to keep the largest arsenal of the world's deadliest weapon down here so well put that 30 miles away from your most populated city. We understand that it's on top of one of if not the largest reserves of oil that you have but because our nukes are so sensitive you can't use that oil as a source.

We will take your population of 5 million voters in to a group population of over 65 million voters so that your collective vote means very little.

These are just a few of the things that would be in the offer. I know there are positives as well. Pulled group resources, stronger and larger military, a group economy.

true,196884,null,null,"Mignolet : 6. Nothing he can do to stop the goal. Unconvincing punch out to give Villa a chance once. 

Lovren : 7 Still having issues with coordinating with teammates. Lost the ball a couple of times in dangerous positions but both times recover well. He reads danger well and cover that too. Made some nice Gerrardesque long passes to wide areas.

Sakho : 6 rusty and need to impose himself more on opposition players. need to be proactive instead of reactive.

Moreno : 6 offensively ok. defensively still tends to lose his head a little. not in sync with the other 3 defenders.

Manquillo : 6.5 another good outing. defensively solid, and provide width going up. needs to work on his crossing.

Gerrard : 5. other than his regularly scheduled accurate long passes to wide areas, he didn't impose himself on the game and was spectator.

Henderson : 7 brings in lots of energy usual. Kept discipline as the ""2"" in the pivot with Gerrard, but that blunted our attack. We need his energy up front. 

Coutinho : 7 He actually has a good game -- visibly frustrated by the lack of runners in front (he miss studge, sterling and henderson's movement). he was the player most likely to do something positive.

Markovic : 4 v. poor game. not enough movement nor intensity in front.

Lallana : 6 Ok debut coming out of injury. But like Markovic, not enough movement. Need to up his intensity and speed if he is too succeed as a front 3 in LFC.

Balotelli : 6 Not a bad game. Again, needs more movement in front -- he needs to learn to make runs *for* his teammates, not for himself. Right now, he only makes runs when he sees he has a shot at goal. This is one big difference between Mario and Suarez -- suarez will run all day for the team.  He was at fault for the Senderos open header (miss fortunately) -- he was the guy marking senderos and Senderos basically ran away from him and Mario didn't track him. This looks like a training ground attack for Villa. +1 for not reacting to Senderos blatant provocation.

Sterling : 6.5 Brings immediate energy and movement into the team. But once Villa triple teamed him, he was marginalized. It did open up space for others so we look more dangerous.

Lambert and Borini : 5 By that time, we are not likely to score.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I completely agree. To quote [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html):

&gt;There are extensively documented productivity gains provided by giving knowledge workers space, quiet, and privacy. The classic software management book Peopleware documents these productivity benefits extensively.

&gt;Here's the trouble. We all know that knowledge workers work best by getting into ""flow"", also known as being ""in the zone"", where they are fully concentrated on their work and fully tuned out of their environment. They lose track of time and produce great stuff through absolute concentration. This is when they get all of their productive work done. Writers, programmers, scientists, and even basketball players will tell you about being in the zone.

&gt;The trouble is, getting into ""the zone"" is not easy. When you try to measure it, it looks like it takes an average of 15 minutes to start working at maximum productivity. Sometimes, if you're tired or have already done a lot of creative work that day, you just can't get into the zone and you spend the rest of your work day fiddling around, reading the web, playing Tetris.

&gt;The other trouble is that it's so easy to get knocked out of the zone. Noise, phone calls, going out for lunch, having to drive 5 minutes to Starbucks for coffee, and interruptions by coworkers -- especially interruptions by coworkers -- all knock you out of the zone. If a coworker asks you a question, causing a 1 minute interruption, but this knocks you out of the zone badly enough that it takes you half an hour to get productive again, your overall productivity is in serious trouble. If you're in a noisy bullpen environment like the type that caffeinated dotcoms love to create, with marketing guys screaming on the phone next to programmers, your productivity will plunge as knowledge workers get interrupted time after time and never get into the zone.

&gt;With programmers, it's especially hard. Productivity depends on being able to juggle a lot of little details in short term memory all at once. Any kind of interruption can cause these details to come crashing down. When you resume work, you can't remember any of the details (like local variable names you were using, or where you were up to in implementing that search algorithm) and you have to keep looking these things up, which slows you down a lot until you get back up to speed.

&gt;Here's the simple algebra. Let's say (as the evidence seems to suggest) that if we interrupt a programmer, even for a minute, we're really blowing away 15 minutes of productivity. For this example, lets put two programmers, Jeff and Mutt, in open cubicles next to each other in a standard Dilbert veal-fattening farm. Mutt can't remember the name of the Unicode version of the strcpy function. He could look it up, which takes 30 seconds, or he could ask Jeff, which takes 15 seconds. Since he's sitting right next to Jeff, he asks Jeff. Jeff gets distracted and loses 15 minutes of productivity (to save Mutt 15 seconds).

&gt;Now let's move them into separate offices with walls and doors. Now when Mutt can't remember the name of that function, he could look it up, which still takes 30 seconds, or he could ask Jeff, which now takes 45 seconds and involves standing up (not an easy task given the average physical fitness of programmers!). So he looks it up. So now Mutt loses 30 seconds of productivity, but we save 15 minutes for Jeff. Ahhh!

true,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"&gt;Only the events of the Time War are locked  

We don't know that, and there is a lot of evidence to the contrary.  

Throughout NuWho, the Doctor has encountered several races and individuals who know of the Timelords, but know them to be gone. He has encountered no-one who knows them to still exist, no matter where or when he has been.  

However, in Classic Who, he encountered several races and individuals who knew that the Time Lords existed, but none who know anything of the Time War or that the Time Lords were gone.  

The only exceptions to this, as far as I can see, have been *Timecrash*, when Tennent met Davison (and remembered it as Davison, which is another exception) and, possibly, this scene in *Listen*.  

This strongly suggests that under normal circumstances, it is impossible for the Doctor, post time war, to travel and meet anyone in the time war *or before it*, and impossible for anyone from the time war or before to travel in the Post-Time-war universe.. Essentially, the post-time war version of the universe seem to be different in that respect, and it seems as though even if the NuWho Doctor were to travel back in time to just after the big bang, he could still only meet people who knew that the Time Lords had once been around, but were now gone.  

Now if the barn in *Listen* is indeed on Gallifrey, it would suggest something different, but we don't know for certain that it was.",0,1410698301,null,0,false,0,ckhwwsr,t3_2gd2y3,t1_ckhwwsr,t1_ckhwm7v,null,1427019184,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,dresdenologist,null,null,"&gt; This may boil down to a Capaldi vs Smith thing, but I feel like Clara was more of an accessory last series while she actually has a role and agency this time around. The fact that The Doctor has picked her up for each episode, she chose to go with him (we all knew she was going anyway) and she even stands up to him and points out when he's wrong.

I think this is a great point and absolutely I agree that this is primarily a function of how the dynamic has shifted between Clara and 11 versus Clara and 12. It was too easy to put Clara into the stereotypical ""smitten Companion"" role and that made her predictable and one-dimensional. But forcing her to deal with a Doctor with whom she has a clearly platonic relationship and a mission (helping 12 find out what kind of man he is) has deepened her potential development significantly.

It helps that not only Clara is strong-willed but also in a position where she has leverage. The Doctor needs her right now and she knows it, and serving as a compass for his journey towards finding out who he is, is a much better role than the doe-eyed, smitten, eye candy role she'd been relegated to last season post-Impossible Girl.

She just has more room to grow now and when the audience is intrigued about where she could possibly go and can't predict it easily, the character becomes more interesting, and therefore, likeable.

true,Vyfzo,null,null,"&gt; You think councils are running at 100% efficiency?

Nothing runs at 100% efficiency, it's called the second law of thermodynamics.  We all agree that every organization wastes resources, but that doesn't mean that any given efficiency drive will actually lead to significant savings, or even save more than it costs.

&gt; Want an example? Scrap the land fill tax which councils are charged. It costs councils a small fortune, they have to tax people more, and it leads to fly tipping. It also costs local businesses as they pay to dump refuse, so its not just councils and the residents that would do better.

The landfill tax is just a financial incentive to encourage recycling and waste reduction (which surely UKIP recognize as good things, even if they are climate deniers).  The money raised from the tax all goes back to central government anyway, so this would not make councils more efficient, it would merely be a subsidy from central government to councils.

&gt; Well that woman was on £160,000 per annum.

£130,000.  I think you are getting her mixed up with the council's chief executive.  Anyway, congratulations, you have worked out how to save some money in hindsight.  If you had a time machine, that information would be useful.  How much money did Godfrey Bloom and Roger Helmer and all the other misogynistic UKIP nutters get, by the way?

&gt; I'm not opposed to six figure salaries at the very top levels of civil service or in the private sector, I'm not even opposed to them getting the odd little free junket at a council level, but there's nothing at a council level that justifies those salaries. They're clerks. Administrators. Middle management.

Why do you think it's so common, then?  Why have democratically elected councillors from across the political spectrum made these decisions?  If councillors are just corrupt and/or incompetent across the board, why should we expect anything better from UKIP?

&gt; They want NET immigration, only that they should have quality and quantity controls.

It wasn't long ago that UKIP's official policy was to stop all immigration for five years.

Barak Barfi, a spokesman for and friend of Mr Sotloff’s family, said ""sources on the ground"" say a member of the group reached out to Isis and sold his location at the border crossing with Syria.

&gt; The first is the classic “stranger-rape”, where a masked individual emerges from the bushes, hits his victim over the head with a blunt instrument, drags her into the undergrowth and rapes her, and the leaves her unconscious, careless whether she lives or dies.

&gt; The second is “date rape”.  Imagine that a woman voluntarily goes to her boyfriend’s apartment, voluntarily goes into the bedroom, voluntarily undresses and gets into bed, perhaps anticipating sex, or naïvely expecting merely a cuddle.  But at the last minute she gets cold feet and says “Stop!”.  The young man, in the heat of the moment, is unable to restrain himself and carries on...

&gt; Let me make another point which will certainly get me vilified, but which I think is important to make: while in the first case, the blame is squarely on the perpetrator and does not attach to the victim, **in the second case the victim surely shares a part of the responsibility**, if only for establishing reasonable expectations in her boyfriend’s mind.",0,1410699027,null,0,false,0,ckhx2w0,t3_2gaemg,t1_ckhx2w0,t1_ckh80e6,null,1427019105,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

He also came rushing out to punch a free kick that he was never going to reach in the first half, but realised this, and then stopped half way in no man's land. Thankfully someone headed it away.

I don't think he was convincing on either goal.

I think he was easily beaten for the Sanchez goal, it was great technique to hit it the way he did but it wasn't an unstoppable strike. It was in a central area and even though Joe's position wasn't great, he got a finger tip to it, so it was within his reach. He would've been odds on to save it had he had a better position.

Speculation, but I think if the whole move was inverted, and on his right side, that he would've saved it. His left side is a long standing weakness.

He would've been odds on to save it had he not been drawn too far over to his near post.

I mentioned this previously, but my criticisms are borne out of expecting a higher standard from Joe.

I don't get how people can say they didn't expect better from such performances, while simultaneously saying they rate him highly.

If you rated Joe highly, then surely you'd expect him to be more convincing than he was yesterday?

If that's how little you expect of him, likewise against Stoke, then surely you can't rate him that highly?

Sigh... No, it hasn't been picked by all sides. Walking away from debt that doesn't give Scotland an ""incredible"" start - it would be Scotland throwing its toys out of the pram. For one thing, as I'm sure you're aware, currency isn't the only asset. Westminster can easily refuse to negotiate other assets in return.

Don't forget there are ""good"" debts too. Remember the pension liability from earlier in this thread that you were so keen to walk away from?

&gt;I don't think you understand how the banking bailout works. The bailouts are paid based on geographical location of business made. So if there is another crash, Scotland would only be bailing out an amount equivalent to the business done in banks in Scotland.

Sorry, but you're wrong. The banks were supported not just by being bought by the government, but also by the Bank of England doing things like adjusting the interest rate (which would directly affect Scotland), making additional money available (directly affecting Scotland) and you're also assuming that the Bank of England will be happy to act as lender of last resort to any Scottish banks should they experience trouble and UK banks do not.",0,1410700594,null,0,false,0,ckhxh12,t3_2ga6i4,t1_ckhxh12,t1_ckhx9wh,null,1427018921,1,false,scottishpolitics,t5_2u66o,1

Throughout the episode we hear two different explanations for the sounds the characters are hearing, for example the sounds on Orson's ship -- Pipes cooling down? Or Something *IN* the pipes? 

In real life upon hearing these sounds we'd just shudder and remind ourselves of the most logical explanation: The pipes are cooling down. But because this is Doctor Who, and we've seen scenarios like this before where it is **never** the most obvious or logical explanation, we automatically assume that shit is about to go down. The expectation for this show is that when given a choice it usually comes down to the more ridiculous option. Except for tonight, where it was more entertaining to turn our expectations against us. Brilliant.

The more I think about it, the more the idea that it really **was** just another kid under the blanket trying to play a prank on Rupert makes sense. Though the fact that they left it completely ambiguous and included an out of focus shot of who/whatever was under the covers is intriguing. Perhaps there really was something creepy under the covers, perhaps not...

""The real point here, and this is the real point, is by international convention, when banks which operate in more than one country get into these sorts of conditions, the bailout is shared in proportion to the area of activities of those banks, and therefore it's shared between several countries. In the case of the RBS, I'm not sure of the exact numbers, but roughly speaking 90% of its operations are in England and 10% are in Scotland, the result being, by that convention, therefore, that the rest of the UK would have to carry 90% of the liabilities of the RBS and Scotland 10%. And the precedent for this, if you want to go into the details, are the Fortis Bank and the Dexia Bank, which are two banks which were shared between France, Belgium and the Netherlands, at the same time were bailed out in proportion by France, Belgium and the Netherlands."" - Professor Hughes Hallet

Extra practices such as you've listed may have been done by BoE recently under the Union, but as that quote explains, it wouldn't even be  precedent for nations to share the bailout weight, based on the business they do. In fact, it's common practice as far as I'm aware.

&gt; you're also assuming that the Bank of England will be happy to act as lender of last resort to any Scottish banks should they experience trouble and UK banks do not.

The BoE already said they would do this, didn't they? They do it for other countries already....

""The Bank of England, as the institution responsible for financial stability, will continue to play its role in the effective functioning of the banking system using its operations under the Sterling Monetary Framework.

Banks receive lender of last resort facilities from across the world, and it is normal for countries to act in a coordinated way to secure financial stability. For example, the RBS and Barclays received significant liquidity support from the US Federal Reserve at the height of the financial crisis.""

true,PeskyAustrian,cnty-uk,Deep South,"Actually I believe this subject is being grossly misrepresented in the press at the moment Scottish issue aside. Publicly funded social care is absolutely available to those who need it there is no doubt in my mind as to that, some councils are however better than others. 

Whilst budgets although having been ring fenced in the past and not faced direct cuts themselves demands placed on them due to at increasingly ageing population have grown to the point that more funding is needed. On top of this pressure the many of the worst parts of bean counting and target meeting in NHS hospitals play a further part in piling pressure on the service with the top priority for them to ""eliminate bed blockers"" (I shit you not that is the expression!) In many cases you get people who should still be in hospital being kicked out into care plans far too early quite aside from what would be best for the patient. As a result much greater burden placed on GPs and care workers who are left to do the best they can.

Despite the woeful lack of funding social care in the most part remains of a very high standard especially when compared to that of the private sector which has become increasingly under trained and unprofessional as new firms scramble to an ever growing market. 

Front line workers have bore the brunt in their working conditions with unpaid overtime, increased workloads and changes to pay and expenses structures. These cost cutting measures are the cuts the bleed to the most. It's not just about not having a pay rise for them it's about making them work harder than ever for so much less than ever before! If anything it's a testament the utmost professionalism of these staff that they've managed to hold the system together as well as they have in spite of everything else. 

What's really happening here is an attempt a push larger idealogical view of central government namely privatisation by the back door. It's a classic case of stressing a system enough until it breaks, blaming it on someone else and then pushing an agenda as a solution to a problem they've caused themselves.

He didn't try any other approach, or to achieve a nuanced understanding, it was just the showmanship of ""look what arseholes politicians we are"".

true,Carlswaen,null,null,"&gt;Nothing runs at 100% efficiency, it's called the second law of thermodynamics. 

Don't be obtuse.  Do you think it's running at its optimal, or even close to it, because I'd argue not.  Rather I think it's a bit of a gravy train and there is a lot of waste.

&gt;but that doesn't mean that any given efficiency drive will actually lead to significant savings, or even save more than it costs.

I guarantee you now that scrapping a land fill tax that the council has to pay will save the council and local business much more than it costs to implement.   It would be HUGE savings.


That whole segment I've quoted is platitudes.

To paraphrse: 'It doesn't mean that results would actually be delivered'?  You can say that about anything.  You could say it about spending more money, or less.  Promising more services or less.  You could say it about any political promise EVER, WHEREVER.

The issue is somebody saying that they don't believe you can both cut council rates and deliver more service.   Two words:  Red Tape.

Anybody that looks at city hall and thinks that we have the optimum amount of bureaucracy, that we can't demand more for less, is either having an imagination breakdown or has simply given up.

&gt;£130,000. I think you are getting her mixed up with the council's chief executive. Anyway, congratulations, you have worked out how to save some money in hindsight.

£130k, £160k, I'm not even going to quibble.  Both are too much, and it sounds like you've just identified a second job to hacked at.  Well done.

It's not hindsight.  Not if there are still people on those salaries.

&gt;If you had a time machine, that information would be useful. 

We could always apply the lessons to next year...

&gt;How much money did Godfrey Bloom and Roger Helmer and all the other misogynistic UKIP nutters get, by the way?

Exactly the same as all other MEPs, although they claimed a lot less on expenses (a virtue of selectively showing up), they didn't go on any EU paid junkets, they did all vote to lower MEP expenses...

...and in the case of Godfrey Bloom, although he is no longer with UKIP or an MEP, when he was with them he gave the cash equivalent to all his EU reimbursements to Yorkshire charities.  Every year.

Didn't know that, didya?

&gt;Why do you think it's so common, then? Why have democratically elected councillors from across the political spectrum made these decisions?

You're kidding, right?    

Councillors are paid peanuts.  These are the bureaucrats and they're getting away with it because there is no oversight, and people don't want to rock the boat or take on the system.   Councillors don't make these decisions.  They inherit them.  They're toothless.

&gt;If councillors are just corrupt and/or incompetent across the board, why should we expect anything better from UKIP?

- Because they support localism which means the councillors would have more say and control over the local system.   

- They support the Right to Recall, so they are held accountable by the electorate.

- They don't have a traditional whip system so officials are able to represent the electorate, and not be forced to follow central office diktat.  It's a key reason defecting Labour and Conservative councillors give for joining UKIP.  

- They support binding local referendums so the electorate will be a lot more engaged.  

You can expect more from all councillors of all parties once the local population is empowered and engaged.

Incidentally, since you're soft balling me, whereas UKIP MEPs have varying degrees of attendance in Europe, UKIP councillors back at home currently top the charts as the hardest working of the main parties.

You can expect more from a UKIP councillor, it seems, because at the moment they feel part of a groundswell movement to enter three party politics, and amusingly they feel as if they're on some sort of purple  crusade.  Village hall politicking was supposed to be dead, but that's where UKIP has done its campaigning.   When Nick Clegg threw a public hall meeting in Colchester before the European elections 60 people turned up.  When Amjad Bashir paid for a hall for Johnathon Arnott to have a meeting in the Northeast over a thousand turned up

You can expect more because they are much more energised at that level.  Tories, Lib Dems and Labour are demoralised.

&gt;It wasn't long ago that UKIP's official policy was to stop all immigration for five years.

Freeze, with work permits during that period.  So still immigrant just not the right to permanently settle until five years was up.

&gt; I don't honestly think there is a level of net immigration that they wouldn't consider too high, or immigration controls that they wouldn't consider 

Either you're not actually being honest, or you're not well versed.     The opposite was actually the case.  They started off with a 50,000 figure but on consultation agreed that it should be flexible, with the option to even double that figure.  It was on the Andrew Neil show that Farage even said that he had no issue if it was 200,000 on the condition that industry called for it and they were vetted.  The BNP even attacked UKIP in their party political broadcast because UKIPs policy was directly opposite to what you've just said.

The very opposite is true.  They have no problem with growth.  They have a problem with infrastructure.

You are going to wake up one of these days and realise that the ""UKIP is anti-immigration"" line parts of the media presented was nonsense, much as most people have woken up to the idea that UKIP are not fascists, which was the prevalent rhetoric 2 years ago.",0,1410702079,null,0,1410702359,0,ckhxw06,t3_2gaemg,t1_ckhxw06,t1_ckhwxa0,null,1427018727,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

You simply can't apply 21st century notions of commercial practice to the 17th Century. England had a fledgling overseas trade establishment that was rapidly growing and would later become the empire... however in 1698 the global power was Spain whose early access to the Americas had made them immensely wealthy. It wasn't really until the UK defeated the combined Franco-Spanish fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 that the UK would be consolidated as the chief naval power in Europe.

In that context, when the Scots approach financiers in England to fund their Darien expedition, already at war with France the English didn't want to antagonize the Spanish to join the fight. The role of the East India Company is radically overstated and infact it was King William III who effectively blocked Scottish access to raising capital outside of his realms (by 1699 Scotland and England were already in a personal union under William III/II of Scotland).

We've played four matches against a range of opposition and only looked as good as last year in one of them. I know we've lost Suarez but we didn't have him for the first 8 games of last season and still only lost once. 

I hope that yesterday can be put down to the fact that we had a lot of new players put into a very difficult situation, playing against a team who were happy to defend in numbers for most of the game. 

However, I feel that tactically, Rodgers' response to these situations of just throwing forwards at the problem isn't the best one to have. It's like he didn't learn from when we faced the same thing last season.

The analysis [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/2gcuq0/player_positional_tracker_vs_aston_villa_see_how/) shows that in the second half we played with basically 6 up front, and it was a total waste of time. An LFC fan in the /r/soccer thread said yesterday that we could have played for 900 minutes and wouldn't have scored, and they were right. The harder you push a packed defence, the more compact they become.

Scotland has everything needed to be a success on its own. That is not in doubt but the SNP are worryingly underprepared for what lies ahead.

The feeling appears to be that the currency question could not be any further from solution, and that simply assuming that the Bank of England are bluffing on allowing the official use of sterling is not very credible.

As the Eurozone crisis has shown, currency union without political union is hugely risky. If Scotland wants to join the EU eventually it needs it's own central bank too.

The question marks are so huge, and it's not just Scotland taking a risk. If it all goes wrong then it will of course impact the rUK massively too. 

However while the Yes vote seems prepared to wing it without having any credible answers on the big questions, the rest of the country has to deal with the situation.

Nobody in England begrudges the Scots this chance. I just think that the rest of the UK would feel better if a small amount of effort had been put into the planning, and it wasn't such a gung-ho pantomime of empty soundbites.

Edit.

What are the currency options.

1. Create own central bank and currency. Estimated instant 10% devaluation and then become a commodity currency (synonymous with volatility).

2. Keep sterling with BoE approval. Means that in exchange for policy concessions, Scottish institutions have access to BoE liquidity.

Problems: economy essentially control by someone else- ie Eurozone crisis. No such thing as political freedom if an outsider if dictating your monetary and fiscal policy.

3. Keep sterling without BoE approval. No control on monetary policy, no Central Bank backstop, no credibility in the bond market. This is the IMF bailout route, and history reminds us that Thatchers follow IMF bailouts.

This looks most likely option and is quite clearly the Winner of the 'Meth and Whisky' award for mentalism.

4. The Hong King route. Stay in UK, press for regional autonomy, huge deregulation, slash taxes. Suck away business from London. The Hong Kong/Singapore of the North Sea. Make long term plans and institutions for full independence.

This seems like the most sensible option, but the one most at odds with SNP 'principles'

Fair enough though, he is still ultimately advising it could hurt the UK economy.

And to answer, we use the pound anyway. Start with no debt and take out new loans, which may actually be at lower rates rather than higher ones. The UK's credit rating is AAA and Japan's is only AA, but Japan has better rates due to their comparative economic stability.

&gt; **S. Dunn; H. Dawson (2000), An Alphabetical Listing of Word, Name and Place in Northern Ireland and the Living Language of Conflict, Lampeter: Edwin Mellen Press**,*""One specific problem - in both general and particular senses - is to know what to call Northern Ireland itself: in the general sense, it is not a country, or a province, or a state - although some refer to it contemptuously as a statelet: the least controversial word appears to be jurisdiction, but this might change.""* ^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland#cite_note-alphabeticalNI-6)


&gt; **D. Murphy (1979), A Place Apart, London: Penguin Books**, *""Next - what noun is appropriate to Northern Ireland? 'Province' won't do since one-third of the province is on the wrong side of the border. 'State' implies more self-determination than Northern Ireland has ever had and 'country' or 'nation' are blatantly absurd. 'Colony' has overtones that would be resented by both communities and 'statelet' sounds too patronizing, though outsiders might consider it more precise than anything else; so one is left with the unsatisfactory word 'region'.""* ^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland#cite_note-placeApart-8)


&gt; **J. Whyte; G. FitzGerald (1991), Interpreting Northern Ireland, Oxford: Oxford University Press**, *""One problem must be adverted to in writing about Northern Ireland. This is the question of what name to give to the various geographical entities. These names can be controversial, with the choice often revealing one's political preferences. ... some refer to Northern Ireland as a 'province'. That usage can arouse irritation particularly among nationalists, who claim the title 'province' should be properly reserved to the four historic provinces of Ireland-Ulster, Leinster, Munster, and Connacht. If I want to a label to apply to Northern Ireland I shall call it a 'region'. Unionists should find that title as acceptable as 'province': Northern Ireland appears as a region in the regional statistics of the United Kingdom published by the British government.""* ^[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland#cite_note-interpretingNI-7)


There is no clear cut answer because NI exists at best as a **region** within the United Kingdom not as a Country. The truth of the matter is that NI will forever be in a transitory stage; forever contested; until the matter is fully resolved one way or another.

What you're there for is to soak up attention. 

And ISIS is the only one that accepts recruits who don't know arabic (I think one element that's being left out of this discussion is that many who joined probably weren't specifically seeking the most radical group, they probably came to Syria with delusional ideas and found that this ""ISIS"" was just the only one recruiting non-Arabic speaker). But do you think a non-Arab, non-Syrian, non-Iraqi is ever going to get anywhere in the command? No. They accept such people because they are especially desperate for canon fodder, moreso than the other groups (who don't want to alienate the locals with foreign fighters). Maybe they want someone to speak in a convincing English accent for their terror videos, but mostly for canon fodder. And once more, as part of the initiation rite, they are forced to burn their passport. I really have to try and imagine what would even happen to these people even in the very unlikely event that ISIS succeeds. But once they win, they're foreign fighters are just going to be an inconvenient element, unemployable, alienating the people ISIS is trying to govern, and unreturnable to their homeland.

That's not even remotely what I am saying. I am saying that we are now playing like most top quality sides, instead of the uber defensive style that has characterized us recently. We don't look any less solid than other top teams right now. City have conceded four, Spurs (not a top team but you get my point) and Pool 5, and Arsenal 6. We are SO much more balanced than Liverpool were last year.

We have been, in recent years, the *only* top team that was obsessed with defending, and it has hurt us greatly in the league. Your point about struggling to break down weaker teams is true, but I would argue that it was in large part a symptom of our ineffectiveness going forward.

But all in all my point is this: we just aren't conceding a worrying amount of goals. Only Chelsea fans, who have been conditioned to be obsessed about defending, are concerned.

Like all religions Islam is a retrograde ideology. It is mired in 7th century traditions and practices and unfortunately it is also the most intensely political and politicised religion I know of. There is no delineation between Church and State and its adherents aren't Sunday Christians like members of the toothless CoE. They take it very, very seriously and, on the whole, their commitment to the Muslim 'ummah' trumps any state or national loyalties.

That is why 40% of British muslims would like to see Sharia Law implemented in the UK.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;I've never really understood why Paxman is so highly regarded.    
&gt; Everyone says how awesome he was for making Michael Howard wriggle, but did that actually help us understand better what happened?

Paxman's interviewing style is mostly noise and berating.

Its popularity is a side-effect of the general public having no trust in politicians at all.  There's a quote which is misattributed to Paxman to the effect that the interview model is, *""Why is this lying liar lying to me?""*  While that's not Paxman's comment it accurately reflects how most people look at politicians.  This is why his loud badgering is popular.

Did it help us better understand anything?  No.  Not on any level and it's hugely counter-productive.  Firstly it's become the main model of interviewing.  Few interviewers do it as *well* as Paxman, but you can see it all over the place.  One of my favourite examples if **[Kay Burley interviewing Nigel Farage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtsU6tSPoyQ)**.  This standard of interviewing would be forgiveable from a sixth-form student but it's just embarrassing from a *professional*.

On top of all this it contributes to politicians responding in an ever more robotic and anodyne way.  They won't even try to answer a question properly for fear of being badgered into saying something stupid.  This is how you get the likes of Ed Milliband saying the **[exact same thing five time in two and a half minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCem9EZb-YA)**.

&gt;Yet Howard's typical-of-a-politician actions were just a product of the same system that Paxman more recently endorsed, when he criticised Russell Brand's failure to vote.

Interestingly enough...  While Paxman criticised Brand in that interview he subsequently made comments to the effect that he pretty much understood and empathised with Brand's position.  There's a video of an interview, but I can't find it at the moment.  What I did find to give you a flavour of this is an **[article in the Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/jeremy-paxman-i-understand-why-russell-brand-doesnt-votei-didnt-either-8921410.html)**:

&gt;Despite telling Brand: “If you can’t be arsed to vote, why should we be arsed to listen to your political point of view?,” Paxman said he sympathised with what the comedian had to say.    
&gt;“I think part of Russell Brand’s diagnosis is right. There is a huge sense of disillusion out there,” he told the Radio Times.    
&gt;“ Russell Brand has never voted, because he finds the process irrelevant. I can understand that: the whole green-bench pantomime in Westminster looks a remote and self-important echo-chamber. But it is all we have.    
&gt;“At the next election we shall have a choice between the people who've given us five years of austerity, the people who left us this mess, and the people who signed public pledges that they wouldn't raise student fees, and then did so - the most blatant lie in recent political history.

As the real question being asked is not so much about if Scotland should be independent but on how the UK should be organised.

true,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,"The biggest misconception about the conflict here is that it has been individualised to an absurd degree. If Ian Paisley did not exist, there would have been another in his place. If Martin McGuinness did not exist, there would have been another in his place. The conditions that led to violence were already set in place, they where systematic. The very nature of the state was on a collision course that would have happened regardless of the actions of the individuals involved.

There is a myth that people like Paisley single handedly changed the course of history this for example.

&gt; Terrence O'Neill spoke of reform and change there was paisley stirring up hatred and rage and the equal and opposite reaction of hate and rage.

It was members of the UUP whom scuppered Terrence O'Neils plans from within; Using Paisley as a puppet, there were close ties from the very beginning between the upper echelons of mainstream Unionism and outliers such as Paisley. 

&gt; Paisley first sat down with like-minded ulster unionists in 1956 when he was invited to the inaugural meeting of Ulster Protestant Action (UPA), a vigilante group created in response to the IRA’s border campaign.
&gt; 
&gt; The meeting took place in the UUP’s Glengall Street headquarters, with senior UUP figures in attendance.
&gt; 
&gt; Gusty Spence, who would later found the modern UVF, was also present. UPA rapidly became a political vehicle for UUP hardliners to undermine moderate colleagues. It ran a candidate in the 1958 Stormont election against Brian Maginess, who had banned Orange Order marches while minister for home affairs. That same year UPA succeeded in getting two councillors elected in Belfast under its own ticket. Another founding member of UPA, Desmond Boal, was elected to Stormont in 1960 under a UUP ticket, reflecting the party’s tolerance of the para-political cuckoo in its nest.
&gt; 
&gt; Meanwhile, Paisley was becoming the cuckoo in UPA’s nest. His two most notorious acts of this period, reading out the addresses of Catholic residents on the Shankill to a mob in 1959 and in 1964 demanding the RUC remove a Tricolour[ Irish Flag] from Republican Party offices in Divis Street, were undertaken through UPA as stunts to seize control.
&gt; 
&gt; He formed a ‘premier’ branch of UPA to sideline rivals, and in 1966 reconstituted this branch as the Protestant Unionist Party (the first PUP), taking it officially outside the UUP, to which it had never ‘officially’ belonged.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ...**The myth of Paisley as the anti-establishment preacher stirring chaos from the margins fosters the perception that he was a random, external shock to a vulnerable system, instead of an intrinsic feature of the system.**

This is also complete rubbish. UKIP existed *long* before uncontrolled immigration became a problem in the UK.

It was only in more recent years when much poorer countries joined the EU that millions of people began to unexpectedly flood into this country.

&gt;Over twenty (20) Muslim nations have laws that declare apostasy by Muslims as a crime, many with death penalty.[20] In addition, some Islamic countries do not have apostasy laws, but have prosecuted individuals or minorities for apostasy using broadly-defined blasphemy laws.[110] In many nations, the Hisbah doctrine of Islam has traditionally allowed any Muslim to accuse another Muslim or ex-Muslim for beliefs that may harm Islamic society. This principle has been used in countries such as Egypt, Pakistan and others to bring blasphemy charges against apostates.[111]

&gt;The violence or threats of violence against apostates in the Muslim world in recent years has derived primarily not from government authorities but from individuals or groups operating with impunity from the government.

....

&gt;A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2010 found relatively widespread popular support for death penalty as a punishment for apostasy in Egypt (84% of respondents in favor of death penalty), Jordan (86% in favor), Indonesia (30% in favor), Pakistan (76% favor) and Nigeria (51% in favor).[114] Another survey conducted by Pew Research Center in 2012 among Muslim populations found little change in attitudes towards apostasy in Islamic countries it was able to conduct a survey. Death penalty for apostasy in Islam was favored by large majorities of Muslims in Egypt (86%), Jordan (82%), Afghanistan (79%), Pakistan (76%), Malaysia (62%), Palestinian Territories (66%); and significant percentage of Muslims in Lebanon (46%), Bangladesh (44%), Iraq (42%), Tunisia (29%), Tajikistan (22%), Indonesia (18%) and Turkey (17%).[115] Governments of six gulf countries - Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait - did not permit Pew Research to survey nationwide public opinion on apostasy in 2010 or 2012.

Edit:  So, the above paragraph says that 86% of Egyptians favor the death penalty for apostasy.  This man was Egyptian.  ",0,1410705561,null,0,1410705837,0,ckhz171,t3_2gctf9,t1_ckhz171,t1_ckhyyov,null,1427018193,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

That's a total fallacy. UKIP criticise the EU policy of *open door mass immigration*, and don't blame the immigrants themselves for the existence of the policy.

UKIP are pro immigration, provided it's controlled - similar to Australia's immigration policy, for example. At the moment, under EU regulations, we have no control over the number of people that come, and can not turn anybody from an EU country away, even if they have - for example - a known criminal record, or a contagious disease. We have no control over who comes, or how many people come, which is insane, (especially considering we are already one of the most crowded countries in Europe, have a housing shortage, as well as overcrowded schools and hospitals).

Plus Lamela has been one of our most consistent performers. I'm not saying that Towns doesn't deserve a chance, but his current form and lack of noticeable growth is why he isn't playing. Taking every long shot and running at every player doesn't merit a first team place. Towns currently has 1 goal (in the Europe) and 0 assists, while Lamela has 0 goals and a team high 4 assist in total. Based on WhoScored rating Lamela is our fourth best player on a 7.24 (not including his performance in the EL) and Towns is on a 6.01, which is the second worst on the team. I understand your frustration  but the stats don't lie, Lamela his simply more productive than Towns and until Towns grows up and realizes the flaws in his game he will not start over a better performer.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;What's the alternative? American style cubicles? I'd rather not subject people to having to work in a Dilbert cartoon.

I've worked in about half a dozen open plan offices over the last twenty years.  Every so often I see an American TV show and have a moment of desperately wishing I could work in an office with American style cubicles.  This is invariably followed by a slightly sick feeling that my working environment is so vile that a fabric covered MDF box would be comparable bliss.

And, you know what's worse?  Being subjected to, *""having to work in a Dilbert cartoon""* is better than I'm likely to get.

For illustrative purposes, I've been in my current job for a decade.  A few years before I joined I would have gotten an office.  My organisation changed to open plan office, but we had large, sturdy desks at least and my nearest colleague was more than six feet away.  About five years ago we restandardised.  The desks got smaller - About a third of the size of the old desks - They're flimsy enough that they bend if you have too many papers on them.  My nearest colleague now sat a couple of feet behind me.

We crammed twice as many people into my office, but there were still meeting rooms and tables set aside for working with others or for complex record reviews.  

Since then many of the meeting rooms are gone, the open tables have been utilised as more desk space, the small chill-out areas are mostly used for work in the absence of other space.  When a lot of people are on the phone, or having conversations the level of noises rises and rises as people speak louder to be heard - It is literally nightmarish.

I probably wouldn't kill for a cubicle.  But it would be bliss compared to my experience of open-plan office space.",0,1410706908,null,0,false,0,ckhzjc9,t3_2gcxtl,t1_ckhzjc9,t1_ckhxeoc,null,1427017958,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

It's a big problem that most people do not understand how a modern currency works, and it is another big problem that it is not being explained in a useful way in the run-up to this referendum. Instead we are getting a simplistic ""Can Scotland keep the pound"" debate which makes it sound as if it just a case of carrying on using pound coins - what is wrong with that?

The reality is that ""money"" is debt. It represents a voluntary deferring of receiving an asset (such as gold/property/etc). You need about as much money (in value terms) circulating as you have goods available to buy. If you put more money into the system then it devalues so that its total value still matches the size of the economy.

As a consequence monetary policies are an important tool for modern governments to try to maintain employment. People are much happier to be ""robbed"" by inflation than to be ""robbed"" by pay-cuts.

So Scotland can ""keep the pound"" by tracking it, or even just using it. For that matter they can use US dollars if they want. But if they are independent it would be stupid to do so. They would not be able to apply an independent monetary policy and if their economy was weaker than the rUK one their citizens would hoard cash and the economy would seize up further. (Equally if they have a strong economy but the rUK decided to increase the money supply the the Scottish economy would overheat with reckless borrowing, etc).

If anyone needs an example of the problems that not having a monetary policy linked to sovereign boundaries causes, have a look at the so-called austerity measures in Greece. The Greece economy desperately needs to devalue the currency in which its debts are denominated, but it can't. The Euro cannot devalue to suit Greece because that would overheat Germany.

'if the rest of the UK will not grant Scotland a currency union, Scotland will not take on its share of the UK debt.'  Salmond has never said this...  this statement I've seen as if they don't get 'Assets' (currency only being a part of them) then they won't take liabilities (debt).

'The oil, for example, is not Scottish until the UK agrees' Categorically untrue.  If Scotland votes for independence they own the land and surrounding water

This article does explain well why i think the currency union or even continuing the use of the pound without a union is a red-herring.  The reality is the average person wants to keep pound as they don't understand economics really.  The reality is this is bargaining chip that Scotland will likely concede and create a central bank and currency (which will be pegged to Pound at first).  Remember that entry into the EU means you agree to join the Euro in the future...  

The author only points to doom and gloom of using pound but conveniently forgetting that creation of own central bank and currency is something that most every other country has done and does do...  Scotland is not a poor country, this is not a high risk.  

It's also very odd to say they will get more austerity than if they stay in the UK, also categorically untrue... for the last 30 years Scotland has been a new contributor to treasury...  Yes, there will still be a deficit (no matter what the vote is).  The argument for Yes is to spend the money differently than the (especially Tory) UK.

Why would a labour politician in a labour area vote to transfer power from a powerful Westminster where Labour have an entrenched advantage to an English parliament where the Tories would have an advantage rather than, say, a north eastern parliament where labour would have an entrenched advantage?

Why would a Tory area which elects Tories accept massive transfers of wealth away from their areas if they have no control or say over what it can be spent on? 'No taxation without representation'.

The US fought a war and has massive transfers of wealth to keep its country going. The result has been a massive amount of pork barrel spending and a more limited national government.

I don't say this because I am opposed to the change, but this is a pretty massive chance being advocated which will effectively neuter the Westminster parliament and it is being done without an explicit mandate.

true,BrokeMyFinger,null,null,"Well the reply of ""scare-mongering"", which is a simplistic term, is usually to counter equally simplistic terms such as ""financial chaos"".

A ""yes"" vote is for Scotland to be independent, there are a chain of decisions and negotiations that happen before the above scenario plays out.

These would be, as I see it, as follows:

* A ""yes"" vote : decision made by people resident in Scotland

* A refusal of a currency union : a decision not made by people resident in Scotland (but they are aware that this is the intention in the event of a ""yes"" vote.)

* The national debt. As this is inextricably tied to the currency and this decision has been made as part of the previous one. However, Scotland could take on some of this as part of the negotiations. I can't see any incentive to take it on given the refusal of a currency union.

* The negotiations over oil. '""The Geneva agreement on natural resources under the sea dictates that they are divided by the median lines. Most people accept that the Geneva approach is the standard approach. Which gives Scotland 91% of revenues."" -National Institute of Economic and Social Research' I expect this will follow international convention and the debate around this issue seems to be about how much oil there is rather than how much of it Scotland will get.

My reading of this is that if Scotland wants to be independent, then the rest of the UK could try to inflict a credit squeeze on Scotland, but why would they be motivated to do this?

If nations didn't become independent due to the uncertainty it would cause in financial markets, and the risk of their credit rating, then we would still have the full British Empire, which was an awful thing.

Also, on the issue of credit, the above was written by a journalist, but:

""Standard &amp; Poor’s released a report yesterday, clearly stating that an independent Scotland would be an investment grade economy.""

We can't have a currency union with such a small country, giving it any more of a say than it currently does.  That would be **very** unfair on the rest of the union.

The issue of resources such as oil, debt are minor in comparison.  A lot of it amounts to a *what have the Romans ever done for us* type thing, the reason I say this, is there are many things they want to keep, but they don't want any of the downsides that are inevitable of having those things.

Currency is the simplest one.  Will they honestly get a better deal with the Euro?  Hell no.  Would it be in our interest to have a union with them, that grants them any more power than they currently have?  Nope.

I don't understand where the yes people are coming from in thinking they could have a better union with the EU, than with the UK.

Any union is always going to have downsides.  As a Londoner for instance, I see us being taxed heavily, subsidising the rest of the country with people saying we don't subsidise them enough.  This is irritating when things like Cross rail are already going to be over capacity by go live.  A union is always going to have downsides for everyone.  However as a Londoner I also highly value the open borders we have, the ease we can trade etc.  So when I hear the view of a lot of the independence people that oil revenue should be spent exclusively in Scotland, I again ask why?  Why should Glasgow benefit from it but not Newcastle?  These are both areas which are net cost to the union.  Both areas which have (in my view) been failed by successive strategic development initiatives.

Because Scotland will retain all the assets that created its part of the debt. It'll still have the roads, schools, housing etc. etc. All the things created by government spending in Scotland. That's how it works. Your debts don't go away because you shift currency. If I moved to a different country, but retained things I owed money on, I'd still owe for them, whatever currency I was dealing in. When countries adopted the Euro, they still had debts.

So, of course, whatever happens with the currency, Scotland will retain its part of the debt. Salmond is just kidding you about that one. He's not in a position to hold that ransom.

Smith: *""I could retire and be the curator of this place.""*

Baker *""You know, I really think you might.""*

Queen Elizabeth appointed the Doctor curator of the under gallery, and it's theorised that's this is what he's doing now. He acquired the painting of the Time War, he knows all about it, its true title etc and goes on to say when asked about the location of Gallifrey: *""Lost SHHH!""* So he knows where it is and knows what the future holds for the Doctor. *""Ooooh... you have a lot to do.""*


Then when 11 is asking if he needs to go find it he hints that they are the same person. 
*""I could only tell what I would do... oh, perhaps I was you once. Or perhaps, you are me.""*
But the last line keeps it ambiguous and up for debate.
*""Perhaps it doesn't matter either way... who know?""* 


But the thing about the faces, the Curator is revisiting one of his old faces *""... but just the old favourites.""* So possibly, in another 50 years for the 100th anniversary, the Curator could pop up again only this time being played by Matt Smith.

Pure fan service but it's a nice idea for fans to think on. The face comment probably doesn't fit into anything this series.

&gt;

&gt;The __Time War__, more specifically called __The Last Great Time War__, is a conflict within the fictional [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoniverse) of the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. The conflict pitted the [Time Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord) against the [Daleks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek) and culminated in the apparent mutual destruction of both races, caused by [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)).

&gt;In the *Doctor Who* continuity, the war occurs between the events of the [1996 film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(1996_film\)) and the [2005 revived series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(series_1\)). It was frequently mentioned and alluded to from the first series of the show's return, but was not directly seen until the show's 50th anniversary special. The war's events and progression have never been fully explained. Short comments in various episodes act as hints, but the war was not thoroughly talked about until the [2007 series finale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_of_the_Time_Lords); the two-part special *[The End of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_End_of_Time)* (2009) provided further information and revealed the Time Lord leaders' sinister endgame. The closing battles and the climax of the Time War were finally depicted in the 50th anniversary special ""[The Day of the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Doctor)"" which ultimately revealed the Time Lords' fate.

There are routes for promotion and development within the job. For example they have specialist teams who's job it is to deal with prison sieges.

That didn't stop them from getting into the shit from 2008 onwards. The Euro has meant that all the European economies are stagnating: even Germany's economy contracted in Q2 2014, while the UK is well into its recovery now. The non-PIIGS economies aren't in crisis, but they're slowly drifting into stagnation, largely because of the currency union and tight monetary policy acting as a drag on demand through the whole Eurozone. 

Oregon isn't in crisis because the currency union is accompanied by a fiscal union - like it is now between Scotland and rUK, unlike it would be if Scotland went independent. If Oregon gets hit by a crisis and California doesn't, the many federal welfare programs in the US will transfer money from California to Oregon to make up for it. If Canada gets hit by a crisis and the US doesn't, Canada's currency can devalue relative to the US dollar, and money will transfer from the US to Canada as Canada exports more to the US. If you have a currency union without a fiscal union you can't do either; you have to try to balance monetary policy so that it stops a huge recession in the country that got hit without triggering inflation in the country that didn't, which is almost impossible. You also can't use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy to the same extent because you don't control your own currency, and the government can run out of it, meaning it can't borrow as much or at such good rates because there's always a risk of default.

Currency unions are good if you're in an [optimum currency area](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/22f5n4/article_of_the_week_a_theory_of_optimum_currency/).

There's a couple of examples out of many of why the scaremongering is nonsense. Scotland isn't going to be an economic wasteland, we aren't all going to lose our homes, jobs and pensions. We aren't going to be kept out of the EU (unless we vote for that). We aren't going to end up in the unimaginably dire circumstances the BBC and other pro-union sources lead you to believe we will.

What you are witnessing is a scare campaign by a desperate establishment to try and convince Scotland they can not survive on their own. If you believe what you see in your news to be neutral reporting about Scottish independence then you have been fooled.

true,GreyShuck,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"Yes, I'm rather surprised about that date.  

I can see that for the purposes of this story, Orson would have to be only two or three generations down the line, but if we have Human time travel by then that does raise a LOT of questions.  

Of course, this was only an experiment (and only partly sucessful), and perhaps it didn't get any further for some reason, but to imagine that even partly sucessful experiments don't get revisited for well over a thousand years seems pretty unlikely.  

Perhaps, of course, that form of technology could only work to send people forwards - and never backwards: it was simply a dead end. There have been other time travel experiments that didn't get anywhere, even earlier in Human history - The Waterfield &amp; Maxtible mirror system in the 1860s from *Evil of the Daleks* etc, so maybe it's just an updated, and equally impractical version of that. Or, alternatively, the experiments brought the attention of more powerful time travelling aliens, who made damn sure that they didn't work.  

This date could put it around the time of the Dalek Invasion of Earth, so you might imagine that the tech could be based on stuff recovered from them, but then a) did that invasion still actually happen in the Post-Time War version of the universe, since, presumably, there wouldn't be Daleks there to invade - at least in the universe as it stood between *Day of the Doctor* and *Victory of the Daleks*, and b) did the Daleks who invaded actually have time travel technology by that point (which gets really complicated if you take the audios into account).",0,1410712918,null,0,false,0,cki28hh,t3_2gdkxq,t1_cki28hh,t3_2gdkxq,null,1427016688,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5
