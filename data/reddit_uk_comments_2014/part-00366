false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,"forensics are pretty clear though that mike brown was resisting. the gun powder burns indicate his hand was so close to the gun, that he must have been within inches of the gun. 

the other issue i have with people in the whole mike brown, or black vs cops violence case is that when someone attacks, brandishes a gun (or toy gun that looks like a real one, see 12 year old boy case) or reaches for a gun, the cops are trained to kill. given all the evidence presented to me, it's pretty clear that wilson followed his training manuel to a t. 

WITH THAT SAID, it will never be known whether wilson called the dude an N***** or said ""get the f*** out of the street you n*****"". it is completely in the realm of possibility that wilson was a racist prick and provoked michael brown (who was high, who did rob a store prior to the shooting, and who was 300 lbs and presented a clear struggle with wilson). 

i don't think wilson is a great guy. i don't know whether he was being racist or not. certainly not nice. but what do you do when you see a big black guy walking in the middle of the street and he fits the profile of someone who had just robbed a convenient store? you don't say ""excuse me sir, please get out of the street"". i do think wilson was doing his job and i don't think brown was innocent in the slightest. i mean why on gods green earth would wilson initiate a fight where he could have lost his life voluntarily. it just seems silly. but that too goes against rationale. 

point being, mike brown case=ridiculous amounts of black support. garner case=ridiculous amounts of criminal cover up, cop backing and lack of action. 12 year boy case=he brandished a toy gun that had been modified to look real, you can't just shoot someone in the leg and expect they wont' shoot back, if you shoot, you're trained to shoot and kill. actually a kid from my high school actually got shot and killed for the same thing many years back. was a tragedy considering the kid was an ethiopian immigrant whose family had moved to the us (i would guess) to try for a better life for their son than they had. was a wonderful kid, super nice, super friendly but got caught up in a gang and his initiation of robbing a bank went awry. he pointed a pellet gun at the officers that had the orange tip blacked out and was shot in the chest. as tragic as it was, he deserved to die in that situation knowing the consequences of pointing a gun at cops.

Women don't make the decision to terminate their pregnancy in a vacuum. There are all sorts of societal factors and pressures. At the moment we're only hearing one side of the argument - ""it's your choice if you want to abort your child you have the right 100%. Your body your rules etc etc"". I don't see why people who take a more moral, religious or different view should be censored in public - they're already completely censored in the mainstream media. Handing out leaflets is a very tame form of protest. These women are welcome not to read the literature on it, or they might not all be the vulnerable victims you make them out to be. Perhaps the leaflets could include a line on ""have you told your husband/partner/father of your child what you are doing""?

Just having one policy on leaving the EU puts them apart from the other parties imo.

There's some policies here:http://www.ukip.org/policies_for_people

You say scrapping the fuel tax, which Milliband himself implemented, as if it's going to be the end of the world. It's only existed for a few years and effects the poorest people the worst. We all need heating. 24,000 died here last year to cold.

That aside you have Germany of all countries, building coal mines and burning dirty coal, (it's a very poor quality coal that has lots of CO2 in it because it's oil rich) while we're sitting here crippling our manufacturing companies putting out a total of 1.4% of the worlds CO2. The only energy form that UKIP don't support, if you read the link, is wind.

|repeal the Human Rights Act and replace it with a new British Bill of Rights.

Not that long ago Britain led the way in human rights, with much of the modern and developing world indoctrinating our way of law and order into their own societies. Assisted by our colonisation in some countries. 
If we left the EU it's a given that we'd need to re-enact the British Bill of Rights.

Even Barnett himself said it should have been scrapped decades ago.

false,I_Eat_Unicorn_Dicks,eng-dorset,Dorset,"I dunno I agree with this. I had a pretty terrifying upbringing. I still have panic attacks if I hear people walking in the direction of my room sometimes because of the emotional damage my parents did to me, even though I have moved out. When this was reported to SS they couldn't do anything because it wasn't severe enough, even though everyone could see I was severely damaged. Had they had the power to actually do something about non-physical abuse it'd have been great. In the article it says that ‘isolating’, ‘belittling’ and ‘rejecting’ children can be criminalised, well I think that a parent who does that to their child should be cautioned, or at least flagged to SS for more help. If it's illegal to do it to another adult - belittling for example - I don't see why you should be allowed to do it to your child. Also, if you're doing it at such a volume/ frequency that the neighbours are reporting you, then that's not a good home for a child. 

And the example in the article, where the mother leaves her 6-year old alone for 45 minutes while she has a driving lesson? That's dangerous. It's her *right* as a parent to do that, but honestly 6 year olds are pretty dumb, and frankly he could very easily have died because he wasn't in any way supervised. 

I think my largest argument with this is 

*""Under the amended offence it will be possible for a parent to be convicted of: smacking a child; not providing it with regular meals; leaving a crying baby alone on the petrol forecourt while visiting the station checkout; even ignoring teenage angst.""*

Firstly, not giving your child regular meals *should* get you arrested, or at least a visit from a PCSO. That is unacceptable in a parent and frankly I would rather that children didn't have to live in those environments, and would happily pay more tax to facilitate that. Also, I think the point that is being missed here is that the CPS isn't going to be prosecuting every tiny complaint; that's not how our justice system works. The law isn't applied indiscriminately, it's applied by people who can make decisions as the the appropriate response. I think this law will allow the police to prosecute where child abuse is present - and for the rest of the parents who aren't doing anything wrong it won't affect them. 

TL;DR: I don't agree with this.

Maybe it's because I'm pretty desensitised to gore myself, I'll admit I have a morbid curiosity that leads me to look at these images.

I have no problem confronting the reality that abortions are pretty gruesome and it's not just a cluster of cells and a bit of blood, but the forks go in and they have to break the feotus up first, then they pull out the pieces, tiny arms, tiny legs, tiny head.

Well anyway he's gone from being second choice LB to pushing Kolarov to fight for that number 1 spot. Think of the time when Richards got injured and Pab Zab stepped up and earned his place. Well it's different circumstances but Clichy is doing the same. 

He likes to get forward and often stays out wide whilst Nasri for example pulls their RB narrow before laying it off to Clichy to whip into the box. He keeps it low more often than not and with Dzeko coming back from injury relatively soon we'll be going for them poachers goals a lot more when Aguero is on the bench. What you should be worried about however is he can on occasion have a blunder. It'll be something daft like he gets split from the left CB and then the opposition play 1-2s around him whilst he plays catch up. However, especially as he looks to be improving, take the risk. 

TL:DR - If he's a tempting price then he'd be a solid choice. Most improved player the past few weeks and has a new found flare

Of course he did it on purpose. Large government borrowing to fund large government spending was the stated and enacted policy of the Blair/Brown government.

Baffling because 1) it is so monumentally ignorant of the facts I cannot believe you mean to imply it and 2) it would mean Brown was catastrophically incompetent if he managed run a huge deficit and not even realise he was doing it.

Why does it though... it's the truth... it's a real image - one of thousands you can see if you google it, or visit certain subreddits.

If you're pro-choice then you really have a duty to inform yourself and be comfortable with it - if not least to be able to defend your position better than just ""oh that's so horrible and it puts people off"".

I mean the real deception is trying to hide from this stuff - make it more like a nice clean procedure.

I guess for me it brings up the same feelings I have towards drone strikes. There's something about sitting in an office thousands of miles away and just hitting buttons like a computer game; that takes away from the grizzly reality of the fact that you are literally dropping bombs on hundreds of innocent people just to get one or two bad guys.

I guess I feel that people should be confronted by the full extent of their actions.. abortions, drone strikes, benefits cuts.... I support as much visibility as possible.

If the women are getting this imagery in the clinic then maybe the poster on the street is unnecessary, but I don't know.

As for alcohol.. someone I was with got taken out of the stadium, into the police van and down to the cell for drinking in the stadium.

He wasn't drunk, they claimed they saw him pouring it on cctv and the evidence was a dribble of vodka in the volvic bottle. I mean I get that alcohol is banned but when you go to the effort to hide it, it seems a bit overkill to be taken to the cells and get a letter from the procurator fiscal.

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; You say scrapping the fuel tax, which Milliband himself implemented, as if it's going to be the end of the world. It's only existed for a few years and effects the poorest people the worst. We all need heating. 24,000 died here last year to cold.
&gt; 

Actually I don't mind that. In fact did I actually complain about that?

&gt;That aside you have Germany of all countries, building coal mines and burning dirty coal, (it's a very poor quality coal that has lot's of CO2 in it because it's oil rich) while we're sitting here crippling our manufacturing companies putting out a total of 1.4% of the worlds CO2. The only energy form that UKIP don't support, if you read the link, is wind.

I'd suspect the wind power view maybe there to win some of the Nimbyism over wind farms being within eyesight of human populations. Here's the thing: We can produce more energy without Coal and Gas. As much as I don't like this, Nuclear, with a proper use of renewable energy as well, would be a better option until a better solution is found. We should also look into decentralised energy, where energy is generated nearer to the sources of demand, would mean less energy is wasted and thus, less need to generate more energy and that would mean less Carbon. The simple fact is a smaller power station or renewable source nearer the source of demand means less energy wasted, less energy needed to be produced and less carbon. Instead of massive power stations in the middle of nowhere perhaps we should be thinking of smaller stations nearer demand. Going back to fossil fuels for convenience in the long run is not a good idea. We need a better thought out energy policy, not a kneejerk, quick fix.

But what worries me about this isn't merely an energy policy that focuses on increasing the amount of fossil fuels we use, it's a party that ignores the facts and 97% of scientists and ignores climate change for what is, comparatively short term gain. Focusing on issues at home is one thing, but wider issues like climate change is another.

&gt;If we left the EU it's a given that we'd need to re-enact the British Bill of Rights. 

OK several things:

1. European Court of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights isn't actually linked to the EU, it's linked to the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe is not the EU and includes states like Russia, Norway, Switzerland, Iceland, and Greenland subscribe to the European Convention on Human Rights.

2. Call me paranoid or foolish but here's the thing: When someone says they want to make changes to Human rights legislation I get a tad suspicious. Who's going to write this new set of rights, who's going to write it, what's it going to say and is there going to be any way that it can be waived, especially when you need it most. We're in a worrying time for our human rights as there is a lot of people who want to change, scrap or modify human rights legislation in light of some high profile stories, usually involving someone we generally don't like invoking human rights legislation. This worries me because I don't want a human rights bill that is either weaker, applies to fewer people or can waived on occasion. Rights apply to people you don't like, that's why they're called ""rights"".

3. Just because we led the way on human rights in the past does not mean we will in the future. There's been plenty of countries who have turned from leaders in rights to totalitarian states. Also, you seem to have a bit of a rose tinted view on our human rights past, there have been plenty of times when our human rights record has been less than sparkling.

&gt;Even Barnett himself said it should have been scrapped decades ago.

OK, the Barnett formula is an issue but I don't want to have a situation where a part of the UK are paying their full tax to westminster, getting less doled out to them than before and then taxing their citizens more to make up for the shortfall. Instead I think that most of the taxes raised in a home nation should stay in a home nation and the only things that home nation pays to westminster should be for things that Westminster provides. On top of that the Home nations should be given powers that will allow it to attract more revenue in the form of attracting businesses and encouraging industries to spread out the wealth some more. It's sickening how everything is centralised in London and it's not actually doing the rest of the UK any good. A home nation should only get money from westminster when it needs it and the fact that it keeps most of it's taxes means it would be encouraged to improve it's own economy.

&gt;There are 730+ MEP's all doing the same or worse.

OK, well here's the thing. It's bad enough when it's being done by any MEP, but it's worse when the MEP publically rails against the EU and denounces it for the thing it's doing. If this was any other MEP there would be outrage and Nigel Farage would leap on it like a fly on a dog turd. When it's been done by a man who rails against this sort of shit, it's fucking barefaced cheek. [What's worse is he even fucking admits it and says he used the money to fund campaigns against the EU.](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/24/mps-expenses-ukip-nigel-farage) Do you have any idea what that's like? That's like Friends of the Earth funding a campaign against Oil using money raised from their BP stocks. On top of that the attendance rates for UKIP in the European parliament is lower than the other three parties only turning up 61% of the time compared to the Lib Dem's 87%.

&gt;All they do is vote for policy that appears from a back-room of lobbied pro-corporates.

And our politicians aren't backed by corporate issues? Follow the trail back for almost every major politician and you'll find some link to corporate lobbies, UKIP included. Corporates are always in our politics from Brussels to council level. Leaving the EU won't free ourselves of corporations it will just mean they'll have to use the Eurotunnel and go over to London to whisper in people's ears and sway their vote. Oh, and if you think UKIP will be all high minded and principled you've got another thing. A politician with morality is like finding an ethical pornsite. Yes they're out there but not many people go for them and they're mostly unknown.

Excuse me but are you fucking crazy? Do you have any idea how much time and hassle suing someone takes? And you want to take this on NOW, when you claim their incompetence has already made you fall behind? Take photos of the damp, post them or go into their office, tell them you have been poorly and ask for their help. 


You can ask them to fit some vents in the wall, but be warned, this can sometimes mean extreme cold gets in and you'll pay a lot to heat the place. 

Someone else mentioned damp being caused by occupants, I recommend you read it and heed their advice. If you leave washing to dry on a clothes line in your property whilst you are out and all windows are closed, you are causing damp. If you cook and the place gets steamy and you do not open windows to clear it, you are causing damp. If you shower without an extractor fan on... You get the idea.

Chest infections are painful and a nuisance, but listen to the doctor. They only put people on antibiotics when they really need to (I had one so bad once that I was on them for 4-6 weeks - not caused by mould!). So at this point I would suggest yours is not that serious and the best thing you can do is sleep with some windows open to clear the air until you are better, and don't have any big drunken nights out, that makes it ten times worse and will make your recovery slower.

Mind you, lets say the Lib Dems die on their arses and UKIP get a lot of seats and a hung parliament happens, the logical option for the Tories (who seem to be the likely majority party for the next election) would be to bring UKIP under their wing in a coalition. This will make some more hard line Tories very happy and we'll have an even more right wing, conservative government than before, but if what happened to the Lib Dems is any sign, they'll not get much success in 2020.

Windfarms are well known to be economically unviable. They have to be backed up by several gas turbines that are often running at far less than optimal speeds, the end result is more CO2 and wasted money to give the appearance of doing something. I read they use the gas turbines included in the power production figures for the wind turbine too. 

I agree with you on nuclear, that was the hippies in the 70's that stunted that for us. It's actually still one of our largest exports, machinery and parts related to nuclear power. Crazy not to develop it imo. We used to lead the world on it.

The reason I presume we will need a new British Bill of Rights is because of the Maastricht Treaty. That is how we're tied into the European Court of Human Rights and to the Council of Europe. If we leave the EU the Maastricht would become void and therefore any other associations involving it. 

Your reasoning on not creating our own is a bit scaremongery tbh. People could have used the same excuses on joining the ECHR. In fact any country invoking the EAW would be able to demand the extradition of any UK citizen, without any evidence, right now, under the ECHR. So you could be sent to any hell hole prison in Europe and held with no charges. How democratic does that sound. That was never allowed to happen in the past to someone with British passport unless interpol were involved. It was just unthinkable.

Barnet formula: UKIP advocate reducing Barnett Formula spending and give devolved parliaments and assemblies further tax powers to compensate. So basically what you and I would like it appears.

I quite like the fact they are using my tax money to fight the EU from within. I would imagine so do the people who voted for them. I want a free and democratic Europe. 

|And our politicians aren't backed by corporate issues?

Of course, I'm not naive to think otherwise. What I do know is that if an organisation is smaller it is easer to monitor and manage properly. The bigger it gets, the harder it becomes to oversee everything properly. It often becomes bloated and wasteful, even corrupt. 

UKIP advocate local democracy. It would be far harder for corporations to lobby if the public were holding referendums and actually making the decisions on major issues. 

It's odd, you seem to want similar things to me, I wonder who you vote for.

Do those people then spend their time with the fruits of such labour, holding a person's hand while they suffer an agonising death from the likes of lung cancer because they thought it 'best for them' to suffer for their moral ignorance? That Cycle poster was spot on.

&gt;t's a real image - one of thousands you can see if you google it, or visit certain subreddits.

So if I can find it in a subreddit, it's OK to put it on a wall, anywhere?  Because I've decided that people just *must not realise*? Wonderful logic. The Westboro Baptist Church use similar reasoning.

&gt;If you're pro-choice then you really have a duty to inform yourself and be comfortable with it

And you'd know that the women visiting this clinic aren't informed how, exactly? That's the assumption you're making when putting up gruesome posters anyway. And why do you assume that 'being informed' makes one comfortable with it? Women are 'informed' about having mastectomies - doesn't make them comfortable about it.

&gt;if not least to be able to defend your position better than just ""oh that's so horrible and it puts people off"".

No further position is actually needed - it's someone's *right*, they don't have to defend their decision just because you weren't involved.

&gt;I mean the real deception is trying to hide from this stuff

You have evidence of the former? Or the latter?

&gt;make it more like a nice clean procedure.

Sure, we wouldn't want to make it as untraumatic as possible in any way at all. Let's stick a big poster up because a woman not understanding and not agreeing with us are obviously the same thing.

&gt;I guess for me it brings up the same feelings I have towards drone strikes.

Which has zero connection to the subject.

&gt;There's something about sitting in an office thousands of miles away and just hitting buttons like a computer game; that takes away from the grizzly reality of the fact that you are literally dropping bombs on hundreds of innocent people just to get one or two bad guys.

Wow, so you really have no idea about what goes on there, either. I mean, (for example) computers can't be that hard - it's just pushing buttons. What was that you were saying about 'being informed'?

&gt;I guess I feel that people should be confronted by the full extent of their actions

Because they obviously haven't given the matter any consideration at all. Good thing people with your logic are around, eh?

&gt;abortions, drone strikes, benefits 

WTF?

&gt;I support as much visibility as possible.

How wonderfully arrogant of you.

&gt;If the women are getting this imagery in the clinic then maybe the poster on the street is unnecessary, but I don't know.

*Maybe*? The last part of your sentence is your first truly accurate one.

&gt;if you google ""aborted fetus"" right now, Google even has a helpful timeline at the top of it's image search showing you 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks etc

I'm sure that no woman in this situation has ever used google for anything, anywhere ever. 

&gt;IMO.

Maybe you, like these protesters, should give the women in these situations a little more credit for theirs.

The US has a lot of ""Local Democracy"" and it doesn't stop corporations lobbying there. Then again, I believe you should keep your politicians within egging distance

&gt;I quite like the fact they are using my tax money to fight the EU from within. I would imagine so do the people who voted for them. I want a free and democratic Europe.

Right, so you have no issue with MEPs effectively misusing EU funds? Even if you hate the EU with a passion you must admit that's just low. If this was any other party they'd be an outrage. If you're against the EU you should keep to your principles at the very least, then again this is politics.

&gt;Your reasoning on not creating our own is a bit scaremongery tbh. People could have used the same excuses on joining the ECHR. In fact any country invoking the EAW would be able to demand the extradition of any UK citizen, without any evidence, right now, under the ECHR. So you could be sent to any hell hole prison in Europe and held with no charges. How democratic does that sound. That was never allowed to happen in the past to someone with British passport unless interpol were involved. It was just unthinkable.

I actually find that very hard to believe, I'm sure you'll shove something up and say ""LOOK IT'S TRUE"" but really I'm skeptical. However the thing is that if another country wants someone they want to put on trial for a crime and we don't want to hand them over for whatever reason, we seem to take umbridge and throw one of our infamous hissyfits. But when a country refuses to hand someone over for trial in the UK we act like it's the greatest injustice in the world. If someone is wanted in another country and there is no reason they shouldn't be sent there, then like them or not, they need to go there, and laws like that allow that. And to be honest the EU for the most part aren't exactly a patchwork of failed states, aren't they? Even the poorest states aren't exactly Somalia.

Also, just because we leave the EU doesn't mean we leave or have to leave the ECHR either. 

&gt;I agree with you on nuclear, that was the hippies in the 70's that stunted that for us. It's actually still one of our largest exports, machinery and parts related to nuclear power. Crazy not to develop it imo. We used to lead the world on it.

Here's the thing, I can see why the Hippies didn't like it. I don't like it, but it's the best option until Fusion becomes a viable thing. There's a big thing around it which leads people to think it's safe but when it goes wrong, it goes really really wrong. There's the issue of Nuclear waste which seem to have this never never quality to it's storage methods and it's decay rate and then once a nuclear site is decommissioned it takes ages to clean up. And as for wind power it's not because it's totally unworkable it's because we have this absolutely retarded planning thing where we treat wind power like traditional sources of power. We place it out the way in massive farms in the middle of nowhere, sometimes in places that aren't actually too windy most of the time where most of the power is lost when it reaches it's destination. The UK has amazing potential for renewables but only if we treat it right. We're the windiest, wettest country in Europe, but here's the thing, wind doesn't work in wind farms in the middle of nowhere, it works better nearer to where it's used. *That's* the problem with Wind and Solar. If we can get that through our heads it would be better for everyone. UKIP seems to dismiss these things and if I were them I would give grants and incentives on how to improve renewables instead of dismissing them out of hand. But if there's one thing I can say is this: Coal is a bad idea. Getting it out the ground is harder and would cause more issues than it's worth, and the amount of CO2 it releases is simply not viable.

I don't actually feel I want similar things to you. I don't really want to leave the EU, I want a smaller, less powerful EU. Like it or not even though we complain about it we sure like exploiting it. We enjoy cheaper food, we like casually bounding about the continent at will troubling the locals, or even moving to sunny climes where we live in self made ghettos where we refuse to integrate with the locals or even learn Spanish. There's more Brits in spain than there are Poles in the UK but at least most Polish people learn english and try to integrate, but the thing is we don't like the fact other countries have freedom of movement, not one bit, despite us taking liberties with said freedom more than anyone. We don't fully pay our way and we throw a hissy fit when told to pay up. We're always calling for special concessions on everything, our MEPs either sit on their hands or play for the Cameras for their fans on youtube, but in reality do nothing, then we complain we have no power in the EU. We're perceived (quite rightly) as racist, xenophobic and hypocritical by the rest of Europe and you know what? I am genuinely surprised we haven't been kicked out the EU. We don't want to play ball unless we get our way ASAP and a lot of Europe doesn't want us in either. It's not like they'll lose anything, we'll still trade with them as our main trading partner and they can kick us out when they want like we want to kick out many of the immigrants here.

If you're wondering who I support, I'm generally a-political I tend to...and this will cause you to rage a bit, Swing between the Scottish Greens and the SNP. I don't like how everything is stuffed down in london economy wise, it's doing more harm than good. I believe Scotland and the rest of the Home nations should have the most autonomy they can get. I agree with the Scottish greens in that we should have an EU that is smaller in power (it's an extraordinary revolutionary idea that we should do something in Europe other than moan and embezzle).

However on the Barnett formula you know in reality it won't work like that. Call me a bitter old Queen but Scotland tends to get shafted in these matters. The Smith commission is turning out to be the dampest of Quibs with Scotland not likely to get any significant powers or not the amount of powers they want (we didn't vote no to get closer to Westminster, ya know). What will happen is it would be used as an excuse to tax Scotland the same but give Scotland less and make Scots pay more in taxes to make up the shortfall, which many Scots obviously won't like. To be honest we would rather have the taxes we raise stay in Scotland and pay westminster our share for things like defense, international affairs and the like. We raise enough tax to survive quite nicely, we would rather just keep the taxes we raise and pay westminster for things they deal with, thank you very much.

Seriously, if you want Scotland to ""Stop whinging"", give them DevoMax and let them keep the taxes they raise. We'll pay our share of things outside Holyrood's remit.

If the government were to quietly ban porn watching via ISP blocks then the court would probably balance Art 10 and Art 8 (expression and right to respect for private and family life) v public order (however they try to justify that) and they would employ the 3 part test: prescribed by law [the ban], legitimate aim (fighting bad sexy juju), proportionate and maybe a little requirement of necessity.

You can rely on these [ECHR] rights almost solely by virtue of the Human Rights Act. This is the statute that tethers the British legal systems to the ECHR and the ECtHR (the court). Should the Poundland or the Rah Rah Rah Party manage to abrogate the Human Rights Act then although we can still follow Strasbourg jurisprudence, we just aren't under an *obligation* to do so, meaning you'll have less tools to fight your case as you're left with only UK case law and statute.

I think that's generally the position in England and Wales CMIIW. I'm not so sure about Norn Iron. Scotland however doesn't need the Human Rights Act to rely on for Convention needs. The requirement to adhere to the Convention is embedded in what arguably is the written constitution of the modern Scottish Parliament: The Scotland Act 1998. Not only do Scottish Ministers and anyone under them generally (civil servants and the Lord Advocate too) have to abide by ECHR and EU Law in general but anything either the Scottish Parliament or Government does that is against the ECHR is *automatically* ""ultra vires"" or essentially not law.

I reckon a fine would be a proper punishment, as in Rio Ferdinand's ""choc ice"" slip-up. I see, though, that Ferdinand got [a three match ban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand#Controversies) after a tweet with a racial slur a few months ago.

&gt;

&gt;In 2000, Ferdinand briefly appeared in a sexually explicit video filmed at the [Ayia Napa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayia_Napa) resort in [Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus) along with fellow English footballers [Kieron Dyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieron_Dyer) and [Frank Lampard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard). [Channel 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4) aired a brief clip as part of their 2004 documentary *Sex, Footballers and Videotape*, claiming it was used to ""remind the viewer that this is based on real life"". 

&gt;In 2002, during the rape trial of their acquaintance Martin King, Ferdinand and former Leeds colleague [Michael Duberry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Duberry) denied allegations that Duberry had molested the woman and Ferdinand had threatened her in the Leeds nightclub Hi-Fi on the night of 22 January, as well as further allegations of scuffling and drunkenness. Both men were interviewed by the police but the Crown Prosecution Service announced in April 2003 that they would not face charges.  King was found guilty of indecent assault and attempted rape. 

&gt;During a radio interview on *[The Chris Moyles Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chris_Moyles_Show)* in October 2006, Ferdinand attracted two listener complaints and criticism from gay rights campaigner [Peter Tatchell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Tatchell) when he called Moyles a [faggot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faggot_(slang\)), followed by ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm not [homophobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobic)"", after Moyles had jokingly suggested he was [homosexual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual). [BBC Radio 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_1) later dismissed the exchange as [banter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banter), while Tatchell said ""since [he] very promptly apologised, I am happy to accept his regret and leave it at that"".

It's more xenophobia than skin based racism, although you do hear a lot less about white immigrants from Poland or Russia than you do brown or black ones even though it's meant to be all about people bringing ""bad"" cultural artefacts like homophobia. 

If immigration is nothing to do with race, why is the primary concern something along the lines of ""I leave the house and don't recognise my own country because nobody is white"" or ""British culture will be wiped out"" and other things which sound remarkably like deliberately disingenuous and vague talking points used by racist Americans 

Russians and Chinese bring over a shit load of homphobia and misogyny but somehow people always seem to forget about them during their totally sincere campaigns to save the gays and the women from the homophobic misogynist immigrants. Or course nobody was concerned about the safety of gay people before they could use us as a puppet to achieve ulterior motives 

When we say ""immigrant"" we immediately see someone who is not white, we do not see Polish or Russian or German we see Africa, Asia and the Middle East. When we say ""immigrant"" we basically mean ""Muslims"", not Russians or Chinese or Eastern Europe or even Africans. Immigrant is just anther word for Muslim at this point. They're all people are thinking of when we discuss immigration. 

The immigration debate is just an extension of the Islam debate, with a small dash of ""poles took my building work"" on the side. That's what we mean when we say immigrant. 70% Islam, 20% too many brown faces and 10% poles took my job. That is our immigration debate.

This is such a tired cliched argument that completely misses the point.

At some point, that bundle of cells becomes an actual human being, with whatever it is that we humans consider makes it human. Nobody knows when this point is. Catholics believe in a soul that is granted at conception. Therefore by having sex, you knowingly and willingly run the risk of creating a human being and by doing so you are implicitly accepting responsibility for the life you've created.

Most women who become pregnant do so through having sex. You want to bring up rape or incest. Fine - you're making the argument that abortion should *only* be permitted in those cases. Personally though I believe that - at least up to a certain point abortion should be available to everyone. Most people do. They just disagree where that point is. 

The thing is, if you have sex, you might get pregnant. If you create a living human being you are responsible for that life. You are under no obligation to have sex. ",0,1417764379,null,0,false,0,cmlt7qo,t3_2o9avk,t1_cmlt7qo,t1_cmkx5e8,null,1425596595,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

In other words your ancestors that were alive 1000 years ago probably came from all over the world, so by that measure you're truly international.

Well that's a bit of a leap... these women are adults - or young girls who've already made adult choices by getting pregnant. However, if I had children a similar age who told me they wanted to be soldiers and fight in wars, I would show them such clips so that they are fully aware what they are signing up for.

Do you work for the army or the government? I can't think why else you'd want to shield someone from the horror of war before they go out there and see for themselves, unless you have an interest in keeping the bodies piled high.

&gt; It's no different from the ignorance on diplay from those who insist that people suffer agonising deaths because euthanasia 'is wrong'. Do those people then spend their time with the fruits of such labour, holding a person's hand while they suffer an agonising death from the likes of lung cancer because they thought it 'best for them' to suffer for their moral ignorance? That Cycle poster was spot on.

I've got no idea what you're talking about here. I'm not interested in having a debate about euthanasia.

&gt; So if I can find it in a subreddit, it's OK to put it on a wall, anywhere? Because I've decided that people just must not realise? Wonderful logic. The Westboro Baptist Church use similar reasoning.

Can you explain to me how the Westboro Baptist Church use similar reasoning to these anti-abortion campaigners... and if you feel you can, please also explain the difference between that reasoning and the reasoning behind an anti-war protest.

&gt; And you'd know that the women visiting this clinic aren't informed how, exactly? That's the assumption you're making when putting up gruesome posters anyway. And why do you assume that 'being informed' makes one comfortable with it? Women are 'informed' about having mastectomies - doesn't make them comfortable about it.

I don't, but I think that in life, there are terrible things and that by hiding those things we cause people to become disassociated from them. No-one should think this is a cluster of cells - it's a *potential* human life that has the resemblance of a human baby.

There are enough girls who've had abortions who later live to regret it - one of the campaigners in the video apparently was one of them. I think if you make a decision like that, you should be informed of exactly what it is you're doing.

If you are confident of your decision - this should not put you off. If you weren't confident of your position, then you shouldn't really be going through with it until you are. There is no harm done in being informed of the whole consequences.

I did state that I have no idea if it's already being done in abortion clinics - if they show images like this, but I personally think they should.

&gt; if not least to be able to defend your position better than just ""oh that's so horrible and it puts people off"".
&gt; No further position is actually needed - it's someone's right, they don't have to defend their decision just because you weren't involved.

Well if there's no room for discussion then why does Reddit exist? Why are you even on here making arguments. You are clearly right and so why are you arguing with me?

&gt; You have evidence of the former? Or the latter?

Your honour I present this thread, in which the prevailing sentiment is that these images should not be shown to women considering abortions.

&gt; Sure, we wouldn't want to make it as untraumatic as possible in any way at all. Let's stick a big poster up because a woman not understanding and not agreeing with us are obviously the same thing.

An abortion is an act of violence against a living thing. I'm not saying that women getting the procedure should have any discomfort or pain, but why would images of aborted feotuses be considered trauma-inducing? It's not a human right?

Do you agree with showing images of botched plastic surgery, animal torture and/or lung damage of a smoker?

&gt; Which has zero connection to the subject.

So you are invalidating my feelings on the subject? Do you realise how traumatic you're making this for me?

&gt; Wow, so you really have no idea about what goes on there, either. I mean, (for example) computers can't be that hard - it's just pushing buttons. What was that you were saying about 'being informed'?

I have no idea what point you're trying to make here other than you support drone strikes. So what type of people are we discussing again?

&gt; Because they obviously haven't given the matter any consideration at all. Good thing people with your logic are around, eh?
&gt; abortions, drone strikes, benefits

Again, the point you are trying to make? I support people being fully informed of their actions. You take issue with that, so... you don't support people being fully informed?

&gt; How wonderfully arrogant of you.

If it's arrogant for me to believe people should be educated and be mindful of all consequences of their actions. Then yes I'm arrogant.

&gt; I'm sure that no woman in this situation has ever used google for anything, anywhere ever.

Oh I forgot, every woman in this situation is given full internet training!

&gt; Maybe you, like these protesters, should give the women in these situations a little more credit for theirs.

I'm not the one calling these women vulnerable, susceptible and too delicate for the truth. I'm not the one saying they should be shielded so as not to be offended.

If the demographic in an area changes, then local businesses will also change. e.g. people move in to an area which is known for its night life, they complain about the noise, pub hours are reduced, night life moves away, late-night kebab stores no longer operate. Happens to red light districts all the time. 

Plenty of ""ethnic"" areas have ethnic shops because they serve the demographic. Those shops generally displace other types of shops. They obviously don't need shops which don't suit their interests.

I'm not saying that this is the case in those areas, but it's not illogical to suggest that demographic change can lead to a change of businesses.

Which makes no difference if you're walking along the street with your child and are confronted with this poster. Oh, did I point something out that you haven't even considered? Now address why I've had to do that *at least twice*. You can figure out why polarising the pregnant to fit your logic doesn't work later.

&gt;unless you have an interest in keeping the bodies piled high.

So explain why they don't show full-on gore on the news. Using logic to overcome ignorance doesn't cut it.

&gt;I'm not interested in having a debate about euthanasia.

Or addressing a parallel either, it would seem.

&gt;Can you explain to me how the Westboro Baptist Church use similar reasoning to these anti-abortion campaigners

I just did. Re-read what you're replying to.

&gt;I don't

&gt;that by hiding those things we cause people to become disassociated from them

If you don't think these women are informed, who are you to then insist they're hiding *anything*? You can't assert that they must be ignorant and then insist that they're informed enough to be hiding stuff. This is the problem with blanket-tarring that both you and the protesters don't seem to want to acknowledge.

&gt;No-one should think this is a cluster of cells

But you're already asserting that these women do - otherwise you'd see the problem.

&gt;one of the campaigners in the video apparently was one of them.

And one of the Westboro Baptist Church members had an illegitimate child - so by your logic, it's OK for her to project her guilt onto your decisions.

&gt;There is no harm done in being informed of the whole consequences.

This has to be one of the the most arrogant justifications I've ever seen.

&gt;Do you agree with showing images of botched plastic surgery, animal torture and/or lung damage of a smoker?

Why, are you going to put huge posters of them up in the street for my kids to see?

&gt;So you are invalidating my feelings on the subject?

You've already done a bang-up job of that yourself already. Have a look at how many of your posts in this thread use 'I'.

&gt; Do you realise how traumatic you're making this for me?

Oh, I thought keeping people informed was paramount and not worrying about their own opinions or education on the subject was secondary?

&gt;I have no idea what point you're trying to make here other than illustrating that I have no idea what's involved in drone strikes either.

FTFY.

&gt;Again, the point you are trying to make? I support people being fully informed of their actions. 

Apart from yourself, it would seem.

&gt;If it's arrogant for me to believe people should be educated and be mindful of all consequences of their actions. Then yes I'm arrogant.

Since your posts have betrayed a complete lack of education/ knowledge on the subject *and* awareness of consequences, you might want to start with yourself before joining the stone-throwers.

&gt;Oh I forgot, every woman in this situation is given full internet training!

Astounding. And you post this on a public board. Any further insults to women you want to put out there?

&gt;I'm not the one calling these women vulnerable, susceptible and too delicate for the truth.

Er...actually, you just called them susceptible and too delicate for the truth. Incredible.

&gt;I'm not the one saying they should be shielded so as not to be offended

No, you're saying they *all* need education whether they like it or not. There are religions in the world that would love to have you on their side.

&gt;I think they are very capable of making their own choices

You haven't demonstrated that anywhere. At all. The opposite, in fact.

Depends on the area, I suppose. If you have finite housing, then the ratio will change as one group grows in number.

I think each region is different and I don't think there is only one reason for a pub closing.

I'm sure it's a combination of effects like prices, competition, the brewery lock in rules, and demographic change.

I'm not sure about smoking bans though. Australia banned smoking in pubs ages ago, just like Ireland did, but I can't find any comparative studies to see if this reduced patronage or not. I'm not a smoker, and I found that I spent more time in pubs because it was easier on the lungs. Plus, I was more happy to bring my family and eat a meal at the pub once the cigarette smoke was gone.

The rationale was to cut down waiting time, and allow sick people to get appointments on the same day. It succeeded in that, but to get an appointment you had to start phoning at 08:00 and keep redialling sometimes up to an hour if it was a a Monday morning. And there was no option to book later in the week for less urgent appointments.

Not everyone found this useful, so they changed to a triage process involving reception and  triage nurse team that phones you back. They also have an internet booking system.

So you can now camp out on the phone for half an hour to explain your symptoms to the receptionist and then to the triage nurse, and them maybe see a nurse or GP same day, or you can make an internet appointment to see a GP in two weeks' time. 

I don't much like discussing my symptoms with the receptionists: they aren't medically trained and don't have the same level of duty of confidentiality. I get the impression they don't like it much either (""I've got pus leaking out of an abscess in my groin. It's a kind of greenish colour..."")

I was doing a lot of research into **evangelical funding of UK churches** before I quit.

Several US christian evangelical groups have decided that the **UK needs to be saved**. they've embarked on a campaign of 'church planting' and 'church restoration'

**Planting** = US missionaries with a blank cheque who attempt to establish evangelical beach heads in the UK. One of the most successful plants was led by the Vineyard movement (vineyardchurches-org-uk) Vineyard is led by the parents of the guy from mumford &amp; sons.

**Restoration** = US missionaries attempt to rejuvenate failing UK parishes. They do this by advising on the tactics used by US groups. Gate church International(Dundee) is great example of this, the Church has a media unit that produces slick christian music videos and promotions (One of their attractive flyers promotes **curing cancer with prayer**)

A day later a retentions person called me and halved the price again for 6 months.

The 6 months is now up and the price is doubling - cue the cancellation.

It's a fantastic bargaining chip, understanding that they have effectively no marginal costs in my continuing to be a customer.

What if your boss gave perks to employees who let him piss on them? What if the only way to make progress in your industry was to allow you boss to piss on you? Would that be consensual? 

The reason we demand a basic level of protection for employees is to protect them from abuse, and being taken advantage of by employers. Plenty of people would work in dangerous conditions for next to no pay because they are desperate, we as a civilised society need to protect everyone to the same standard. 

&gt;I mean we're talking about industries where the actresses are fully consenting, and many even get pleasure from being treated like you describe.

Completely irrelevant. An employee is an employee, regardless of what industry they work in, and they deserve the same basic level of protection and respect. 

I take issue with the suggestion that lost of people make about the people in these films enjoying what they do. The porn industry is very careful to ensure that all of their actors appear happy and willing in all of their films, it is another part of the act to make sure consumers do not feel any moral problems with watching the material. Look for interviews with actors who have left the industry, and a large number feel they were abused and taken advantage of. 

I'm not saying that all actors dislike the work they do, I'm saying for them its a job just like any other, just like everyone else has, with good parts and bad parts, and for many, some of the bad parts might include being spat on or hit or slapped.

Think about whether you would be happy working in conditions like that. If you would not accept these working conditions, why would anyone else be happy with them? 

&gt;But when you become a porn actress, and accept work from an S&amp;M porn company, what do you expect?

You might not have any other options. After a few months working in the industry, perhaps those are the only roles being offered to you. Perhaps you were told you could get more roles if you did a couple for more extreme films. There are hundreds of ways a vulnerable person could be cohered into consenting to being abused.

It was fantastic - everything worked out perfectly: flight landed early, got to hotel and then out to Loftus Road with plenty of time to get a pint at the Springbok. Got into our seats in time to see warmups and make a few pregame obscene gestures to the Leicester fans sitting 30 or 40 feet away.

&gt;And we really enjoyed the game - thought it was a bit sloppy all around, but exciting nonetheless. The rhythm of the scoring - Leicester going up, then QPR matching, and on - made for a great up-and-down ride and lots of good chanting back and forth.

false,iheke,null,null,"I'm tired of the ""Poch must get his own players"" mantra that keeps on being trotted out by the talking heads. It's stupid. He wants the highest quality of players possible in every position. To illustrate this point, if Baldini wanders in and offers Poch, say Messi, he'll say ""Hell yes."" and find a way to make him work in his tactical scheme. The idea that he'll say ""thanks for the offer but Jay Rodriguez is my kind of player"" is idiocy. Every manager wants the highest quality possible. End of.

The idea of this massive clear out is completely fanciful. Anyone who seriously supports this club and has followed this club for a long time will know that we don't do fire sales (we sold Livermore to Hull for £8m for christsakes - that is indicative of our transfer approach).

My general feeling is that Poch will only go into the market in January if an absolutely top player becomes available for a ridiculously low price. I think in January, the question is impact - will Moreno or a Martinez definitely have that immediate impact in January or will they need to settle in (if the answer is the latter, then why pay a premium for a player that won't immediately add points on the board).

I think he will experiment with Kane and Soldado (and a little bit of Lamela/Chadli) this month to see if its enough up front for the rest of the season and I can easily see him ""sticking"" until May (I may be proved wrong if Huntelaar suddenly becomes available for sub £8m but the point I will continue to make to people is he'll be 32 by the start of next season so he's a long way from the typical levy signing).

The stories on Samper and Traore are just comedy. These are two of the most desirable 19 and 18 year olds in the world. Enrique spoke of Samper (just yesterday) being a natural replacement for Busquets, Traore has just (November) signed a new contract at Barca until 2018. This is Football Manager '15 type rumours so any sensible Spurs fan should just ignore them.

Lastly on the transfers out: the only certainty is that we'll try to find a home for BAE. Adebayor's form is rubbish and his personal life (which has become very public) is a joke - but even if the club wanted to get rid, is there a buyer out there that can afford him. City virtually gave him to us for free - his contract expires (according to transfermarkt this summer) I think this is a situation which we'll have to manage until he goes. Also, I guess having him (in the last 6mths of a contract) might be helpful in the run in. I do fear for Dembele and Townsend because they are simply not doing what he wants. Both are talented and I'm not sure how much time he will give them to produce. I think all the talk around Paulinho is premature, I think it is clear that he has been on a program (in terms of fitness, learning the scheme of play - being the last to return from the WC) I have a sneaky feeling he'll find a role for him. I think everyone can see that Lennon is staying so that is just nonsense. Which leaves, Vert and Chriches -- I must say after the latter's Europa League shocker he's lucky to get another shot. I think he's talented but wants to play when he should choose safety first. On Vert, he's clearly one of the better defenders at the club but he is very accident prone.

Behind the Anfield Road stand there's very little space before it hits Anfield Road and then Stanley Park behind, so expanding backwards there would be hard (the current plan seems to be to extend into the corners). For the Centenary it might be possible if we built on the current car park behind the stand and then demolished some more houses to make way for more car park.

The Kop is impossible to expand without just making it steeper and higher - there's zero room to go backwards as it's already running right up to Walton Breck Rd (there's maybe 5 metres of space between?), which is a pretty major A-road for the area.

At some point, your little precious one is going to see things you don't approve of, you can't shield children's eyes 24-7. The smartest thing to do is if they see something like that is to talk to them about it and how it feels.

&gt; So explain why they don't show full-on gore on the news. Using logic to overcome ignorance doesn't cut it.

I don't know why they don't, I don't run a news room. I suspect it would have something to do with the government stepping in if they did, but there's appetite for it - I'm old enough to remember the furor around Diana's car crash... are you?

&gt; Or addressing a parallel either, it would seem.

What parallel? Whatever that was you posted made absolutely no sense to me. Besides, if you don't like me bringing up parallels with drone strikes then you don't get to use similar logic.

&gt; I just did. Re-read what you're replying to.

Wow... you call me arrogant.

&gt; If you don't think these women are informed, who are you to then insist they're hiding anything?

I don't know what ""these women"" you are referring to specifically, but have I stated anywhere that ""these women"" are hiding anything? I'm speaking in general terms about the truth, not about specific women.

&gt; But you're already asserting that these women do - otherwise you'd see the problem.

No I haven't. I'm stating that they should be informed. If they are already informed that's great!

&gt; And one of the Westboro Baptist Church members had an illegitimate child - so by your logic, it's OK for her to project her guilt onto your decisions.

I doubt she knows who I am, let alone able to project 'her guilt' onto my decisions. Are you under the illusion I'm considering an abortion or something?

Let's parse this line and break it down... A woman who previously had an abortion is an anti-abortion campaigner, a WBC member had an illegitimate child... so what is the link again?

&gt; Why, are you going to put huge posters of them up in the street for my kids to see?

Well actually, those types of posters are on the streets at protests and in doctors offices. Don't get about much, do you?

&gt; You've already done a bang-up job of that yourself already. Have a look at how many of your posts in this thread use 'I'.

Oh FFS. Can't have a bit of humour. Here add this lot to the count - IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

I am not projecting my arguements, I am not building straw men, I am being careful to frame my position based on my understanding and experience. I am not assuming that others have the same view as me. I am not getting upset or trying to shut down opposing views.

YOU are being accusatory, arrogant and inflammatory - just look at how many of your posts contain YOU~ and YOU'RE. You offer no explanation for your assertions - you simply state ""go back and read my comments"", ""I've already said that"". Just plain lazy.

&gt; Oh, I thought keeping people informed was paramount and not worrying about their own opinions or education on the subject was secondary?

Did I say education was secondary? I think my argument has been for education and information equally... are you against keeping people informed?

&gt; FTFY.

This is lazy and rude, rather than make your own arguments or justify your position you simply edit mine, or avoid the question.

&gt; Apart from yourself, it would seem.

Laziness... again, no argument offered but to discredit my character and intelligence.

I'm not even going to try to explain how juvenile this response is.

&gt; No, you're saying they all need education whether they like it or not.

So as well as supporting drone-strikes, supporting benefits cuts, you're against mandatory school education too. Got it.

If I'd had my GoPro on that was.

The GoPro I find to be a little to big.  I was also advised against putting anything on my helmet by my sisters boy friend who worked as a materials scientist on amongst other things, safety helmets.

There is one thing that I do wish I'd had my GoPro for.  The Met Police have done pretty much the minimum.  The driver was given a training course, that's it.  He told a witness that he knocked me off on purpose because *the cyclist thinks he owns the road*.  Which is very funny, because I was in a cycle lane.  Thankfully my injuries healed without complication.

If I'd had good video footage, I could easily have wipped up some youtube anger.  Including the footage of him threatening me as I lay on the floor trying to figure out if I had anything broken or not (turned out just a few fractures).  Would this have resulted in anything?

You see far more tit walking around the lingerie section of marks and spencers, yet a women feeding a baby is ostentatious?

edit: should also point out that breastfeeding is difficult but as lots of benefits for the baby and the mother (one being that its free food!) lots of women are discouraged from breast feeding and articles like this don't help. Some of the difficulties include the fact that it can take ages, no women wants to sit in a corner for ages trying to get her baby to feed, and what if there is no corner to sit in? The alternative is to sit in a toilet which is not very sanitary. Also some babies don't like being covered while feeding so putting a towel over their head is not always an option.

It's generally portrayed as a misogynistic view that the manner of someone's breastfeeding should be something other than their own completely free choice, and is often held up as a means by which men attempt to control women. I've always thought it was just that some people find it a bit off-putting and I'm sure that must apply to women as well as men. 

Personally, there are some places I would prefer not to see it happening (although I accept that it has to) and I wonder if that makes me a misogynist. I'm pretty sure I'm not one but maybe someone would like to tell me otherwise. 

I just can't understand what is so offensive about being asked to do it discretely. Just because you don't think that other people ought to feel uncomfortable at the sight of it, doesn't mean they're not. It seems to me to be quite unreasonable not to respect their feelings.

As an answer to someone asking what went wrong...

There are a number of issues. 

Firstly we had an utterly woeful pre-season, it was a seemingly random selection of away games, and a single home match (against Porto) which allowed us to gain no momentum. Even worse, our second to last warmup (I use that term loosely) match was against Leicester in fucking Thailand- we fly out there, our jetlagged team lose (in a poor game) and any confidence we might have had was knocked right out of us, as we had to play them in GW2. 

Adding to that, our defence started the season poorly, and hasn't really improved an awful lot. Jags looked depressed, Distin went AWOL, Howard was back to his usual unreliable self (after a good 2013-14) Baines started awfully and Coleman was injured. Our only shining light was Stones, and he got a serious injury. 

Whilst our defence has got a bit better (largely due to Jags picking his head up and Coleman working back to fitness) other issues have come in. We are utterly reliant on McCarthy in the middle of the park to provide both off the ball possession retrieval and his passing momentum and movement when we have the ball- he has been injured twice already this season with the same injury (hammy), and we have looked a shadow of ourselves in those games. 

If we go back to the start of the season though, we can also point fingers at Martinez. Last season we were very positive and continually applied pressure on the opposition, which meant they were not able to get into a rhythm- even when we were ahead. This season though, Martinez has been seemed to be lacking confidence and set up the team to be more cautious, and it has cost us hugely in games against Leicester, Arsenal and Palace are ones where we were cruising, put of foot off the pedal and allowed them right back into the game (Wolfsburg at home also, but the result was better there). 

Martinez has also showed less diversity in the way we set up the team this season, I feel largely because of the Europa. At the start of the Euro campaign he seemed to want to play the first 11 in every game, but soon found that players were getting hurt and tired, and we suffered from the famous 'hangover' effect. We have now started rotating the team to prevent this, but the real issue is the lack of time he has to spend with the team. 

At our best last year we were very much a 'gameplan specific' team- in that we would have a plan of action to exploit weaknesses in the opposition, and would be pretty bold in it's execution (for example playing Lukaku on the wing vs Arsenal threw them right off and worked wonderfully). With 1 day to train after a Euro match (especially if travel was involved), we are just unable to execute this fully. 

We can also add poor execution up top. We have missed Mirallas through injury and lack of fitness, Lukaku played through injury and pain and Barkley picked up a serious injury pre-season. Whilst Mirallas is back to his best, Lukaku is very on and off still (and the gaffer has admitted it will take until new year to get him at full strength) and Barkley has been shambolic. Missing are those moments of inspiration that ended in a killer ball or shot from last year, and they have been replaced with constant running at defenders and belting it over... It pains me to say, but Ross looks like an even shittier version of Andros Townsend when he is in this form. 

Can we turn it around? I would like to think so. There have been moments of quality, but we need our key players fit and firing at 100%. IF we can get Barkley, Baines, Stones, McCarthy, Lukaku, Mirallas and Coleman playing anywhere near their best- we will beat pretty much anyone... But the problem with Martinez's system is that if one cog is loose, the whole machine can't operate correctly.

They don't need video for that, unless the person is crafty and cunning they can simply check the records or even just the device.

Remember, your little camera isn't some forensically guaranteed thing, from what my lawyer was telling me, they are useful when they corroborate witness statements, but he would choose a witness over a camera record.

&gt;Woman started deliberately swerving her car at me, forcing me into the lane for the M27 whilst calling me all sorts. I could have had her done for dangerous driving.

I doubt that very much.  From looking into some statistics (I'm trying to meet my MP to discuss this further) the met generally put forward training courses instead of prosecution.  The evidence required for those is pretty much nil, they rely on the fear of someone being told they could be charged under the road traffic act for something else.  So they opt for a £300 fine and a few hours of schooling instead, voluntarily.  It doesn't even change the premium.

They love this, because it saves them time, and counts as a solved crime.

In my case someone explained to the police that the driver told him, that he hit me on purpose to teach me a lesson.  *Obviously I'm still bitter about this* Yet the police decided to do nothing more than a training course.  I also feel they lack something less serious than Assault with Deadly weapon for this kind of thing.

The met really do not give a toss about cyclists, from the lawyer I've spoken with, cameras do little to change that, unless you are able to get enough attention from your video.

However, this isn't just a case for the met, I think it's just that the CoL really do appear to care, a friend of mine had someone collide with them in a bus lane, the driver was charged for driving without due care and attention.

This is a good example of why a video is no magic bullet:

I am definitely for it, I 'sit' in block 109 and i haven't we haven't used the seats for years. I prefer it like that but it is sometimes dangerous. For big games when everyone has had a drink the celebrations can make you go over the seat in front of you. The derby a couple of years ago me and the lad who sit behind me ended up 2 rows forwards on the ground! i have scars on my shins to prove this! Proper safe standing would solve this. If people at grounds all over the country are going to stand anyway then provisions need to be made to keep them safe.

The old argument to do with hillsborough, tragedy that it was, are not valid. It has been shown that poor policing and overcrowding were to blame and nothing to do with the fact it was traditional terracing. Safe standing properly policed would in my opinion be completely safe, but you would need to regulate numbers somehow, as for big games i could imagine people from all over the ground wanting to move there.

However i can actually see why some councils, MP's, FA members etc are against it. Even if they might secretly not have a problem with it, if they were  to give it a go ahead and something did go wrong it would be their neck on the line. Unlikely as that may be, even our club who have shown interest in the idea, may not want to implement it first purely to make sure they are not liable for any disaster.

Safe standing would increase the capactity and in theory reduce ticket prices. I am not convinced it would be a massive reduction though, i said in an earlier reply to you football clubs are businesses, and i could see them just seeing it as a chance to increase revenue and not as a chance to get the working class fans who are the lifeblood of clubs back into the grounds.

Even though i think it may be some time off, and there are potential problems i hope it goes ahead. Personally i would be happy to pay the same price for my ST in the standing area as i think it would improve my match day experience, however i know this isn't the point of safe standing in most people's eyes.

We only need to look at the German model to show it can work in big leagues.

I have seen women breast feeding their babies in a completely understated and natural way. Quite often a coffee shop or somewhere else with seating where not only the mums but the babies can feel comfortable. 
However, there is a minority if women who seem to feel the need to advertise the fact they are breast feeding in public in a confrontational way. I used to work in a large supermarket which had not only a cafe but a mother and baby room for comfort and convenience. A woman felt the need to sit in the middle of an aisle in front of a set of doors to breast feed her child. The woman clearly chose to sit in a place which was not safe, probably in the hopes someone would ask her to move so she could shout from the rooftops how unfair society is against breast feeding women. 
So while I believe Farage should keep his misogynistic beliefs to himself, I would welcome a female MP to open an honest discourse about the struggles real women face about quietly and naturally feeding their child in public.

false,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; These laws do not prohibit ANY of these things from going on in the porn industry, so long as they are only published abroad, this is regulation law for content published in the UK, not any kind of industry wide regulations... Even content published here but made abroad will not be caught...

Which basically puts an end to these things in the UK porn industry, as the vast majority of UK porn is consumed in the UK. This law has been implemented to protect British workers, that is the point. Other countries can do as they with, UK consumers can watch it if they wish, as long as no British worker is harmed in its production. 

&gt;Not only do very many more injury's happen in main stream movies than in porn. But there is a whole division in movies called 'stunt men/ women' who are under payed and exploited risk takers. Basically expendable people who are spat on, slapped, beaten up and generally put in danger without much recognition or payment; Compared to the porn industry which has much better compensation, recognition and safety requirements.

I completely disagree with this. Stunt performers earn a reasonable wage and have some of the best medical and safety regulations in the world protecting them. They are well treated and well respected, and very few complain about conditions they work under. 

A small UK based porn producer will offer nowhere near the level of safety to its employees, and you just have to look at what many actors say after they leave the industry to see there are many who feel taken advantage of, abused and regretful. 

&gt;What made you think a regulation on publication would effect working conditions anyway?

Because UK porn is only really consumed in the UK, so banning these acts from UK publication removes all reason to include them in the first place. There is no international market. 

&gt;All this will do is drive money abroad; And actually DE-regulate the porn in the UK, as 100% of it will now be coming from overseas, and outwith our jurisdiction.

Nobody is talking about regulating the worldwide market on porn. This is simply about improving the working conditions of UK workers. The rest of the world can treat its employees however it wants.

It may well have been done for my titillation, but that is not to say it is a welcome sight. 

In the recent Claridges incident, surely the waiter would have asked the woman to cover her breasts if she were just waving them about for the fun of it. Why does having them out suddenly  become appropriate for the situation just because a baby is feeding off them? 

There does seem to always be this assumption that those who criticise public breastfeeding hold entirely contradictory views on the exposure of breasts in general, which is why I'm interested in knowing if there are any women who disapprove of it. The ""it's not for my benefit so I don't like it"" view can't be the only reason for finding it uncomfortable, can it? I certainly can't speak for Nigel Farage, nor do I have any desire to, but I don't think it's fair to assume this opinion to be held by all men. To my mind, it's a bodily function like any other and therefore there are situations where discretion should be applied. E.g. burping is normal, but when you're in a restaurant, you put your hand over your mouth and do it as quietly as you can.   

I appreciate that my hangups are my own and no one else's and I would certainly never presume to instruct anyone to ""cover-up"" on my account.

You do know the SNP have just come out wanting a points based immigration policy, just like UKIP? I don't blame them either, it's sensible to control your borders. How exactly they plan on joining the EU and then controlling their borders is beyond me.

 I can understand the Scottish feeling like they do, (Mums Scottish). How you feel about Westminster is similar to how I feel about the EU. Only I'd prefer smaller localised government and to leave the EU. Yes I am starting to hate the EU, it's effected me quite badly over the years and seems it will continue to do so. More legislation coming next year that could well destroy my business, and possibly thousands of others. I wish they would kick us out. No I don't really care about UKIP and what they do with their EU funds. We waste Billions a year on the EU as it is, as one of the three main contributors. What difference is a few more million going to make. They're at least using the money for something I agree with. If you had a Scottish MP in Westminster, who was constantly pulling them up on their anti-democratic BS wouldn't you support him/her? Despite what they were paying him, and all the other MP's.

You say you want a smaller, less powerful EU. There is no way in hell is that ever going to happen. They repeatedly state their aims and devolving is definitely not one of them. They won't hand any power back, they won't let us control our own borders, they have no intentions of changing to accommodate us. Year after year they introduce more legislation that takes more power away from its satellite states. Funnily enough much of the coming legislation, that takes the most power away from us, is right near Cameron's 2017 supposed referendum. 

The only option now is to leave and set-up separate governments for each country within the UK.

There are plenty US based production companies that have sets in the UK, they will operate just as they have before, except they will only publish abroad.  Sure it will put many actors on the dole, but it will not change conditions for the ones still working, to think otherwise is just naive.
&gt;Stunt performers earn a reasonable wage and have some of the best medical and safety regulations in the world protecting them.

Some of it is comparable to the porn industry, and some is not.
&gt;and very few complain about conditions they work under. 

Let me re-quote you on this, i think it applies all the same; ""The [film] industry is very careful to ensure that all of their [stunt personnel] appear happy and willing...""
&gt;look at what many actors say after they leave the industry

Generally most actors who leave the industry are rich or bitter because there are not rich. Most stunt men/woman leave the industry poor and arthritic, and get no attention whatsoever in contrast.
&gt;There is no international market. 

Seriously?  What planet are you posting from?
&gt;This is simply about improving the working conditions of UK workers.

Its nothing to do with that, they are not even trying to sell this as a benefit to workers; Probably cause more people who work in porn are upset at having just been put out of business by their own government.  The fact that you think the government have ulterior motives, and are conspiring to make porn actors lives better is not great comfort to most of them as they enter the wonderful world of minimum wage labor.

Has a nice overview.  The fun things to look at here is it already opened 1.75 below last nights close, that sets up a bad concensus with the morning trading.  It's rallied a little bit, back up 0.5, and will probably close above opening unless something else bad happens.

The thing is, would an investor see this as an act of a struggling firm?  Sure, but they already knew it was struggling.  Would they see it as an act that could likely land the firm in trouble?  Probably not, as they'd need suppliers to come forward and complain, as there is currently a lack of evidence of law breaking.

So the worst an investor might think, is that they will have to stop this in the future (future earnings might be less) or that they might suffer some boycotting type thing.  Now when you look at shouty groups, the likes that have been moaning about starbucks, vodafone, amazon.  None of those firms have suffered massive drops in sales because of these actions.

I would suggest checking with Edinburgh Central Youth Hostel, it's a 5* establishment with the standards matching those of a hotel (or being fairly close). However, if your group will be willing to share 6-bedded rooms they won't brake your budget which will be the case with most hotels granting that you will find one. They also have singles, twins, triples etc. available, catering or self-catering options. The best bit is that you don't have to share the rooms with people outside the group and I know that they can have groups of up to 200 people.

If you require any further details please check the SYHA [website](https://www.syha.org.uk/where-to-stay/lowlands/edinburgh-central.aspx) or the [tripadvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g186525-d209119-Reviews-Edinburgh_Central_Youth_Hostel-Edinburgh_Scotland.html) page.

It does often seem to be made into a gender issue. The language is often along the lines of ""*women* shouldn't be told what to do with their bodies"" etc. And while I agree that they shouldn't, it seems to be more of an issue of personal freedom than of patriarchy. It just happens to be over something that only women can/need to do.

I guess the difference between ""boobs in a sexual context"" and boobs when breastfeeding, is that in the one case you are showing them and in the other you are using them. It's not just breasts, though. There is a big change, in terms of social acceptability, to the status of any body part when a substance starts coming out of it. Most people will grant breasts special status in this regard, but I don't think it's beyond the realms of imagination to see why somebody might not. 

Again, I don't believe its something that people should be going around instructing others on, but I don't think it's unreasonable to say that you would prefer them to be discreet when specifically asked your thoughts on the matter.

- Lost the plot over salaries. Perfectly legitimate say him earning £450k and complaining about mad salaries was ironic even if his predecessor *was* paid more, and the same goes for the £150k pay outs. Just because they are capped at £150k doesn't make it a crazy number. Being marginally less wrong than you were before, doesn't make you right.

- Increase in Senior managers earning more than the PM vs. Senior manager numbers falling by 30. This isn't a correction, its just a bit of sleight of hand.

Second off points based immigration isn't automatically reasonable immigration. It can be, but it can be soft or overly tough. The fact the SNP is adopting the policy if you are telling the truth doesn't mean they are adopting UKIPs position.

Studies in the US found that the motivating power of a salary drops off significantly at about $80,000 pa because at that point you have enough money not to be worried by everyday troubles.  One analogy is that if you can easily afford to replace all four tyres on your car at the same time then you are probably at the point where money is no longer an issue.

This sort of ""money attracts talent"" argument is also a rather sketchy area which has been controversial for some time.  The notion of a ""war for talent"" in which companies must offer high value incentives for high quality people has only really led to an increase in the wage gaps in large companies with no equivalent increase in performance.  This inequality has actually made people less happy and encourages individualised behaviour to the detriment of the company.  One of the early case studies used to highlight the success of talent management was Enron.

Public services do not offer large remuneration, they offer stability and expect intrinsic motivation.  The clearest examples of this lie in the military and the NHS: if wages attract talent then why do we have so many exceptionally talented soldiers and nurses?

What we need is to attract people to politics for the right reasons: people who want to do what is best for the country and are intrinsically motivated because they honestly believe that they can make a positive difference to people's lives.

This is actually a really tricky one, because there are many pollutants.  Contrary to popular belief, as that article I linked mentions, it's sometimes a myth that trains are more environmentally friendly, granted that is rare, but it doesn't have to be.

For instance I drive a 0 tax rated diesel, yet I'm sure many other cyclists agree they are disgusting things, but hey ho, I can drive through the C-Charge for free!

I agree it has to be on a case by case basis.  It's just some people have this odd idea that banning motor vehicles would make us some utopia.  Cars for many people, such as my parents who live in Cornwall, a very cost effective, and the impact on the environment there is also a lot less than say in London.

I also think cycling is an amazingly good one for somewhere like London.  Imagine if we re-purposed some of the roads to make them bicycle only.  Those who lack fitness / disabled could be encouraged to use power assist or fully electric bicycles.  The running costs of some of these fully electric bicycles is minimal, last time I was in Vietnam I was surprised to see how popular electric bicycles are, these cost less than 500 USD and have a range of around 15 miles.

Nothing in this world is perfect as I'm sure you're aware.

Then there's been a concerted effort to undermine them and make them look bad in anyway possible by the existing establishment: 

http://www.thecommentator.com/article/3371/exclusive_leaked_documents_reveal_tory_spinners_in_intensive_anti_ukip_media_briefings

The thing is the media do this all the time. With UKIP they don't have a party whip so everyone has their own personal opinion that is not party policy. Of course it's easy to show those clips and then accuse them of lying. I had the local Labour MP stand at my front door and do it yesterday. Just because someone answers a question with their opinion, that does not make it party policy. With all the people that read a headline, then believe that to be true facts, that doesn't matter. They do need to tighten up and just start answering with policy, not opinion.

The SNP and points based immigration was in the paper a couple of days ago, how true it is I don't know. I do know its stupid to hand out 600,000 NI numbers in one year, and to let another 260,000 new people into a tiny island, from England's perspective.



I'm not interested in the EU any-more. We can't change it. None of the other three parties want to, it's like their retirement home when they've failed here. I've gone beyond trying to reform it. Its been so long and nothing has changed, it's just got worse. We were even tricked into joining it at the beginning. Thank goodness we didn't join the Euro like they all wanted us to.

I do a search for UKIP 'today'. It's how I keep up to date on things in the party, I'm always keen on winning someone over of course, more votes, more chance to leave the EU. I do feel strongly about it, I want our  government in our countries that are answerable to the public, right of recall, referendums, as you say politicians within egging distance. Not all sitting in Brussels voting on policy that just appears from a backroom and where MEP's from all across Europe can vote on law and legislation that effects my country, even if it's not in its best interests. That's simplifying it to the extreme but I think I've already explained my reasons.

On the face of this this is about ""the right to perform a perfectly natural activity"" but if you dig deeper it isn't, it's primarily about attention-seeking and actively looking for reasons to be offended. This is what happens when staunch feminists have children, they need to invent new things to get outraged about and fight against. If it isn't street harassment, it's the glass ceiling, ""banter"", maternity leave, breast cancer marathons or some other identify politics derived non-issue.

It's the direct equivalent of a young woman wearing very provocative clothing in a club or bar, then getting ""outraged"" at all the men who are leering at her or approaching her. Some people really do crave victim status. Said woman can then complain about this on social media saying she's the victim of oppression. The net effect of this is twofold: She gets lots of sympathy (read: Likes and Retweets) from other women who have experience ""sexism"" and so can empathise, and she also gets more attention from men who take it as a clear and direct signal she is a high-status female and probably very attractive. Also that she gives off signals to the environment that she is ""available"" (whether true or not is irrelevant, most men will think they have a chance). So she is permitted to paint herself as both a victim of oppression, and a highly desirable woman. It's a win-win. This happens all the time on social media, but a few take it further by contacting a national newspaper or starting a Facebook campaign. 

You have to ask yourself why has this become a big deal, and why do these things keep cropping up in the national media and in public discourse? I think humans - who naturally naturally cling to group collectives - are increasingly turning to far-left identity politics in an attempt to recreate the sense of belonging once found in religious faith or national identity, both of which are on the decline. Social media has a big hand in promoting this narcissistic behaviour by allowing you to curate your own feeds and essentially live in a bubble where you can create your very own individual sense of reality. You need not ever cross paths with someone who shares a reasonable but opposing point of view, but when that does happen you have what we now see in weekly Twitter storms or furores.

I think this is a horrendous way to evaluate our democracy, having to validate it by comparing it to some pretty terrible regimes instead of just being able to examine it flaws  and see how we could be better.

There are many reasons I am glad to live in the UK rather than countries such as Syria and North Korea (and a *long* list of other countries) but recognition of that does not change that our democratic system is fundamentally flawed by creating a polarised politics ruled by fear (due to FPTP) and funded by the wealthy who look after their own interests. That North Korea is a hellhole does not make my vote in the UK any more worthwhile because the choice is not between Kim Jon Un and David Cameron.

You say we have the 'luxury of voting' but to someone who is completely disillusioned by the process this means nothing because voting is seen as having no effect. Additionally I think it is reasonable to believe that the UK has not devolved into a North Korean-like state for more reasons than our ability to vote. I'm glad we can freely criticise our politicians, but that doesn't fix the flaws in the FPTP system.

false,Blubbey,null,null,"My criticism of Lamela so far:

1) Loses the ball too easily too often dribbling.

2) Bit too conservative playing the ball, he's quite defensive in that regard, like he's afraid of losing it. For example coming a bit deeper, receiving the ball and playing it back immediately.

3)  Needs to turn out more to play it. Whether this is a combination of him, lack of calls from the team (being told you can turn) I don't know but it's common with a few others too.

4) Needs to look up a bit more, sometimes he misses runners and passes he can play.

5) He should try and take a few more risks when passing. Like a ball in behind, over the top, playing someone through. It's like he's possession focused and doesn't want to lose it, which is nice, but the best teams play that killer pass. For example [that](http://youtu.be/HshqlTSOcco?t=55s) Fabregas pass. Who the fuck tries that? Could've not done it but he did. Lamela needs to try and take some more risks. Yes, things won't come off but he is a good player, he's quite able to do more things than he's letting on.

6) Please, for the love of fuck learn to tackle. He lunges in and goes to ground far too often.

7) Needs to get stronger. He's quite lightweight at the moment and doing what he's trying to do (beat a man and hold him off, get in tackles) he really needs to get stronger. It'll take time but he can get there. He doesn't have to be [Elokobi](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/George_Elokobi_1.png) but he needs to put on a bit of muscle.

8) Needs to stay out wide more, drifts in far too often. Occasionally sure but if there's no width, you're easy to mark. Having 4 players all within the 18 yard box is a piece of cake to defend and we don't want that.

9) Work on that weak foot damnit. He tried a shot at Hull so I'm guessing he's working on it.

Nope. 52% said they'd pick at least one element seen on similar acts worldwide. That's not the same as supporting the Act Sinn Fein are proposing.

You're a unionist, so likely none of that is important to you, but coming from the tradition responsible for the decline of the language, it's my opinion that you have fuck all right to oppose it. You can oppose your taxes going towards it, that's your right, but if we were make funding it optional, we'd better make funding the likes of the BBC optional too.

So is masturbating. Still, I'd rather people don't start jacking it next to me while I have my coffee. 

It's a physically intimate act between a mother and child. Nobody is denying that including Farage. I think his point is that businesses ought to be able to decide how they cater to people in these situations. A £100 a meal cafe-restaurant in Marlebone might decide breast feeding is absolutely verboten since it doesn't fit with the image they are selling. Conversley, a costa coffee in Slough might decide it's okay because they want to appeal to mums out shopping during the day... all be it they should be discreet about it. A children-orientated cafe next to a creche might decide to go all out and allow customers to do it wherever/whenever - but perhaps might put signs up to warn other customers that is their policy.  

I intensely dislike this 21st century mumsnet notion that breastfeeding is second only to god, and by extension ANYONE who criticizes those who do it in public is the spawn of satan himself. The bottom line is, although its natural, bearing your breasts in public is a vulgar act to some. It can make some people feel uncomfortable. Being a mother with a child doesn't make breastfeeding any more morally virtuous than having the right to not have your sensibilities offended in public. Both groups have a right to be catered to. So rather than prescribe or proscribe it, we should leave it up to businesses to decide how they will cater to their own customers. That I believe was Farage's argument.

We've won/drawn games due to individualistic performances, I don't recall a single game from us so far where the entire team played excellent. Even against QPR we played mediocre football.

Did we deserve to win against hull, everton, southampton, and west ham? No we didn't. We were very lucky to win and probably only deserved draws. And those 8 points are the difference between us being a midtable team (which we are very lucky to be) and being in contention for being RELEGATED.

And that isn't even going into detail about our draws, we were lucky to draw sunderland and considering recent year stats we were very lucky not to lose against arsenal. Those two points right there would mean we're on par with leicester on the bottom of the table.

While lets look at swansea's games, shall we?

4-2 defeat to chelsea, and they scored the opening goal. Bony red card against a dominated southampton, goaless draw against sunderland/everton, draw against newcastle/palace, and 2-1 losses to city/stoke.

The rest they won, and pretty comfortably. And there isn't a game there besides the goaless draws that swansea didn't score the opening goal.

So is swansea going to keep losing their leads and are we going to keep getting points by individualistic performances? I doubt both.

When things are going well, they're cheering on the team and saying how we're the best and things like ""in bobby I believe,"" but the moment we get a few sub par results everyone turns on the team and the manager. That's not how you support a team. You don't go around pointing fingers at people blindly.  You stick behind your team and try to actually find out what the problem is before appointing blame. It may be that it IS the manger or players fault but there hasn't been enough proof to support that theory yet. From observation of pervious years it is safe to infer that the problem is coming from the busy Europa schedule because other teams in our position have had the same problem.

Not sure that's considered naive, i think its about attempting to find answers on how to reform the system to be more accountable instead of just blindly accepting strongly hierarchical elitist power structures who only represent a very small group of people but yet have the right to governing the entire country under the same edict.    The way that UK democracy is also not working at the moment because of all the tactics that are employed by 'centrist' parties, which all seem to mirror each other and want to sustain the power hierarchies :/

The argument about it being an argument between 15 to 19 (or studenty) I think shows a lack of knowledge, and people who have decided to conform to the status quo and stopped asking is this authority/power structure valid and good for the most people, which currently it clearly isn't, in fact it's outright brutal to non-conformist types who get accused to be terrorists, dissidents or crazy radicals.  

I agree that perhaps that Brand is exactly the greatest representative of these points, but at least his transmitting the message with more common sense then academics. Which a lot of the points his raise are genuine problems and it's great its sparking debate and attempting to make people feel they exist on certain political points.  

Also, to assume Brand 'has' the answer is also a misnomer, because no one really does, it needs to be a collective decision by all of us on how to tackle the biggest issues of our time and allowing an individual or a chosen state group of representatives on the subject corrupts the principle due to the perceived power that can be gained. No one deserves unwarranted or permenat power ever.

You might not agree with me, but I feel there are some serious issues in the UK, even in the Germany there are many power problems like the UK which need to be neutralised before trust can even start to creep back in.

How do you expect us to challenge for a top 4 spot if we sell our players that keep contributing against them? And who exactly did we replace sigurdsson's important goals with? A backup lb and a permanently benched goal keeper.

Yep, that sure will help us get points against top competition.

Eriksen was already in the team before poch arrived, so there is no news there. But that doesn't change the fact that eriksen plays BETTER on the wing than he does behind the striker, while sigurdsson plays poorly on the wing yet he has been proven to be world class behind the striker.

And I think you've gotten the two names switched up, eriksen is no sigurdsson. And that is a fact. He cant shoot like siggy, he cant pass like siggy, and he cant defend like him either. There isn't an aspect of this game that sigurdsson isn't better than eriksen at. Aside from acceleration/dribbling.

And sigurdsson is only slow in acceleration, he was the fastest premier league player in full sprint until just a couple weeks ago, and he is still in second place. He is still the holder for most distance traveled in the league which was opening day against united.

Eriksen is pretty much the opposite, fast acceleration slow full speed. But you need acceleration/reaction timing on the wing, which is why it tactically works when eriksen plays on the wing.

Kane has been playing cam in some games and he isn't fast at all. So what you just said is fucking retarded.",0,1417789515,null,0,false,0,cmlz47z,t3_2ocpzu,t1_cmlz47z,t1_cmlyv08,null,1425591861,-1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,-1

If you actually listen to what Farage is saying, **legally I don't need to get over it**. What you really mean is *you* think I ought to be okay with it... Now for the record I've not voiced my personal feelings towards it. I have only pointed out that *some* people are offended by it, and they have an equal right to be offended by it as the mother does to do it. In doing so **you** might think they are small minded and backwards... but your feeling that way doesn't immediately invalidate their opinion because the mother has a baby and come across as progressive and they don't have a baby and seem antiquated. 

Ultimately therefore it ought to be up to the establishment to decide on a set of rules they can follow. Those that don't respect those rules can reasonably be asked to leave the premises. So a breastfeeding mother in an establishment that clearly says no breastfeeding might be asked to leave.... BUT conversely a tutting or rude patron in another establishment that allows breastfeeding might be told to tolerate it or leave as those as the rules. 

I don't agree that women have some intrinsic right to breastfeed in **all** private enterprises. I am *somewhat* open minded to the idea that if a venue allows children under 4 into their premises then they should reasonably allow breastfeeding... though I'm not completely sold on that idea either - as it implies breastfeeding is an essential function rather than a choice. And whilst there are certainly health benefits to breastfeeding, those benefits are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things and missing a single feed is not likely to be detrimental. You could also argue the mother has a choice of voting with her wallet over which establishments she will shop in and can **choose** to visit those shops that allow breastfeeding.",0,1417790382,null,0,1417790626,0,cmlzhdo,t3_2ocodd,t1_cmlzhdo,t1_cmlyxw0,null,1425591207,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Putting £8,000 into your pension at 27 is better than putting £8,000 into your pension at 29, absolutely, but personally I don't think the risk is worth it. The only way to insulate yourself from the risk is to keep the total money owed in a current account so you can pay it off at any time but you're going to have to pay tax on the interest from that, so you're probably going to achieve maybe 3% after tax (if you find *the best* current account deals and juggle them) which is barely over the 2.7% you're going to pay for the privilege of borrowing the money. 

The only way for this to make enough gains to justify considering it is if you don't hold back the cash to pay off the borrowed money, but then you're taking significant risk: what if you lost your job. Pension contributions are one way until retirement.

Farage has given a response here:

So what? They have every right to express that view. Also I think you'll find more people opposed to this act than you think.

&gt; The multi-party agreement recognised ""the importance of respect, understanding and tolerance in relation to linguistic diversity"", especially in relation to the Irish language, Ulster Scots, and the languages of Northern Ireland's ethnic minorities, ""all of which are part of the cultural wealth of the island of Ireland"".

Other than that in the GFA I don't know what part of the peace process referenced the language or said we have to have any kind of Language Act, never mind this one.

&gt; it would encourage usage of the language.

I think there are better ways to encourage the use of the language than forcing through an act most are opposed to. 

&gt; Encourage usage of the language, the word you, with your superior grasp of the English language, appear to have missed while reading the quote above.

Encourage and support are pretty much synonyms in this case so I didn't really think I needed to explain that my point applied to both, i'll be more clear in the future if you need though.

I assumed that once you were in the higher pension band, 40% tax relief is paid on all contributions up to your yearly salary, rather than the amount of tax actually paid. In hindsight, this is clearly wrong! I'm still trying to get my head round tax relief. So 40% is only paid up to the amount of tax paid from income within the higher band? - By this calculation, I could claim about 1k in 40% tax relief. And 20% is paid up to the amount of 20% I paid? 

I also assumed that the card offered essentially free (2.69%) money to borrow if one stays within the terms. I heard about this deal by reading the Money Saving Expert page on money transfer cards. The deal I quote is half way down the page. It doesn't need a balance transfer into it, rather one has to move the cash from the credit account to another account within 60 days to receive with 0% deal.

Lastly, I am not concerned about failing to pay off this extra amount into the pension as I can cover it by selling bonds or dipping into the maxed out current account.

Offensive:

Eriksen averages 50 passes a game, Gylfi who often goes hiding for long stretches averages 35 passes a game. And keep in mind Gylfi plays for one of the most possession obsessed teams in the league.

Eriksen has about 3 shots on goal on average, Gylfi has 1.5.

Erisken has 5 goals vs Gylfy's 2 goals.

Eriksen has on average more dribbles each game. But, they have the same amount of bad touches per game.

Key passes/and assists Gylfy is better. 

Defensive:

Gylfi get dribbled past twice as often as Eriksen.

Eriksen averages 1.8 tackles a game versus Gylfi's 1.1.

Lastly, Brendan Rodgers is your selling point for the big clubs wanting Gylfi?

&gt; *They are believed to have landed at Mobile Bay, Alabama and then travelled up the Alabama River along which there are several stone forts, said by the local Cherokee tribes to have been constructed by ""White People"". These structures have been dated to several hundred years before the arrival of Columbus and are said to be of a similar design to Dolwyddelan Castle in North Wales.*

This would be the same Dolwyddelan Castle which didn't yet exist in Madog's day, I take it? The stone castle at Dolwyddelan was constructed in the early 13th century by Llywelyn the Great, and added to after the conquest by Edward I. The Dolwyddelan Castle of Madog's day was a wooden motte-and-bailey construction. Besides, these forts have more in common with Iron Age hillforts than medieval castles, [both in their design and their age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Stone_Fort_(Tennessee\)).

And as for this nonsense that the Welsh and Mandan languages are related, well, [I'll just leave this here](http://www.languagegeek.com/siouan/mandan_is_not_welsh.html). The languages have completely different inventories of consonants and vowels, completely different sentence structure (Welsh is a [VSO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb%E2%80%93subject%E2%80%93object) language while Mandan is [SOV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93verb)), and completely different morphology. 

I can well believe that the Mandan used something like coracles, because coracles are about as simple as it gets when it comes to boat design. They've been around since the stone age.

The fact is that the evidence for pre-Columbian Welsh influence in North America is limited to the dubious testimonies of eighteenth and nineteenth century adventurers, who were convincing themselves of White Indians everywhere - be they the descendants of Prince Madog or Lief Eriksson.

You don't understand? Really? He is the best goalkeeper in the world and their probably hasn't been a better keeper in terms of being the completely player in **history**. His shot stopping, control of the box, and kicking/distribution are all out of this world.

While he doesn't deserve the Balon D'Or he definitely deserves every single drop of praise he gets. 

&gt; he plays for Bayern Munich and Germany for god sake, of course he is gonna get a lot of clean sheets.

I completely agree, but that is why I don't judge goalkeepers by cleansheets. Anyone he does is completely misguided. Clean sheets are more of a representation of a team and a defense than the individual goalkeeper. A better way to judge a goalkeeper is just purely by the way he plays, and in that respect Neuer is the best goalkeeper in the world.

&gt; Yes, he occasionally makes some good saves

Understatement of the year right here. It seems clear you have some extremely biased views of Neuer. I have no connections to Bayern or Germany but I can look at him unbiased for what he is, and that is one of the best goalkeepers to play the game.

I guess that could just be very poor wording on the behalf of MBNA then, but they make a distinction on the page between a ""Balance transfer"" and a ""money transfer"" but under ""money transfer"" they list that a balance transfer is required.

Research suggests certain nutrients can help you lose bodyfat faster or from around the waist as well as being skin friendly.

Official guidelines include *at least* two servings of fish (up to four oily a week), *at least* five of fruit and veg a day in the full rainbow of colours (many countries advocate seven to nine), three servings a day of reduced fat dairy a day, plenty of other mineral rich foods (seeds/ beans/ lentils), a wide variety of different foods.

Aside from the critical oily fish other skin friendly fats are from whole eggs, seeds, avocado, olives, coconut, unsweetened cocoa. Serving sizes of animal protein are surprisingly small so have some little and often from breakfast. Be aware lean white meat like chicken breast is very low in nutrients, so it's actually not the best use of calories.

Formal exercise is a subset of physical activity, the 10,000 steps is the minimum recommended for basic health. The more active you are the higher your metabolism. A pedometer can be a helpful tool.

Oh yeah, lesson learnt. No prior criminal record, just that I'd had a tough time for a few years and then decided in sadness and shock to drop everything and go travelling, while still in a life-daze. Got high in Bangkok, whilst experiencing a fever and medical interactions, and suddenly (deliriously) thought it'd be hilarious to shoplift a GoPro. Not a good life-decision.

Not a cop-out btw, I was conscious of what I was doing, even if I was whacked. Still, four months sentence in a Thai jail, two weeks served so far.

Shantaram I have mixed feelings about. I read it a couple of years ago and was staggered by the power of the lyrical passages mixed with the feeling of being conned when the author is very obviously making shit up in his narrative interactions. Did you feel that? Still, I liked it all the same.

You know what book I loved when I was inside? Michael Chabon's Kavalier and Clay. So alive with the sense of energy and escape and endless possibility. I was on a concrete floor, hungry, for days. It was ok as long as I had that beautiful, thrilling book.

Why the fuck did anyone ever think it's just or redemptive to part prisoners and books? Imprisonment (like war, and poverty and many other things) is something every voter should have to experience firsthand, even briefly, before they are entitled to vote on these matters: they have no idea otherwise.

Impractical maybe, but the alternative is (the current) farce.

The motives at play here are twofold. Do you think it's a coincidence that everybody has independently just started to attack the BBC? It's a conspiracy of friends who have a common enemy.

The newspaper owners are threatened by the BBC, it's the best andmost respected broadcasting company in the world and a hell of a competitor. What you get for about a tenner a month is embarrassingly good compared to what you get for nearly ten times as much on Sky and completely advert free, which is an absolute joy for me. The BBC has constantly pushed the envelope and forced their competitors to adapt, which probably keeps Murdoch awake at night. The BBC does have privileges that others don't, but that's society's gain and Murdoch's loss. He has plenty and the BBC is too important.

The Torys don't want to be held to account and answer the questions that must be asked by the most trusted broadcaster in the world after a failed term where instead of a Big Society©, zero deficit (as promised) and a protected NHS, we have a declining society with a worrying political climate being exacerbated by the Tory's horrible rhetoric, more debt racked up in one term than Labour did in all four and an NHS on the verge of crisis; held together by the goodwill of the staff who are crying out for our help by striking at an alarming rate. They really don't want to be doing it. Trust me, it's not a fun day out, it's hard and you feel guilty and you don't get paid. I work with these people and it's heart breaking.

Just to ensure I now get Tax Relief, would you mind taking a quick look at my calculations to ensure I fully understand pension relief.

Person A receives 50k P.A in salary. She earns £21,865 within the taxable lower tax band, and pays 20% tax = ~£4400. She earns £8k between the higher rate band of 42k and 50k, and pays 40% of 8k in tax = £3200.

She can therefore claim up to £4400 in 20% pension tax relief a year and a maximum of £3200 of higher rate relief.   

To achieve her basic relief limit she would have to pay up to  ~£20,000 into her pension, and to reach her higher rate limit she would have to pay in around ~£7500

Therefore she can contribute £7500 and receive 40% per year, and can contribute an additional £20,000 and receive 20%.

Now, he stays further behind more often during attacks so he doesn't expose his wing as much but he is also further away from the goal. Some of this is playing in a 4231 rather than a 433 but I'm convinced that he has been instructed to be more mindful of when he goes forward. His tracking back has been very improved this season though. 

Some of you are saying that his natural position is CAM. This is not true, while he has the technical qualities to succeed in that role his decision making leaves much to be desired.

I look at it this way with Amy and Clara, he was having a mid life crisis and wanted to be fun and cool.  He liked to strut his stuff, though he ended up being a little more dorky than cool.  Amy and Clara however never challenged him.

The Doctor's companions are his moral compass.  With his age and what he's seen its easy for him to become bored, so he lives through them in a sense.  With each adventure he can see the wonder in their eyes like a child seeing the ocean for the first time.  To him that's who his companions are, children who he entertains and keep him sane and good.

Teasing him with possibilities.  Then you have the look.  When she looks at him he knows she sees more than any others who see him.

This is just my opinion but I love River's character.  I wished they would elaborate on it more but at the same time it might lose some of its charm.

false,withabeard,null,null,"&gt; What the hell is a credit rating, 

It's an independent measure of how likely you are to be able to repay a credit account.

When you take out some kind of credit, there are two questions on the creditors mind. Can you pay this back and will you pay this back. The ""can you"" is based on your income and your outgoings. The will you, that comes from having a proven track record of paying other people back in the past. That comes from the CRA.

The CRA typically gives out a score (0-1000), that a creditor turns into a % chance of getting their money back based on other information they ask you for.

&gt; why is it important, 

Simply put, creditors wont want to give you credit if they don't get an answer to ""will you pay this back"".

If your score is bad, it's usually a sign that you've failed to repay a creditor in the past. And no-one wants to deal with a bad debtor.

Be aware though, a poor score can also be a sign of someone who rarely (or never) takes out credit. We've seen customer complain their score is low. Looking into it, they were born to a wealthy family and never needed to take out any credit. So their score was poor, there was nothing to base the decision ""will you pay this back"" on.

&gt; and how do I go about making it ""better""? Do I just take out loans and repay them on time? 

Pay your credit bills is the big one. Just taking out loans and repaying them is clearly a personally expensive way to increase the amount of credit you've got on record. But taking out a credit card and always repaying it in the first month. Having a well paid mobile phone contract. Having a well paid overdraft. Will all increase the score.

Another good example. Buying a bicycle, and there is an interest free credit option. Take it, make sure you pay it.

For various reasons, CRAs will take other things into account. Living at an address for a long time makes a CRA more confident you are who you say you are, that statistically means you're more likely to repay credit. On the same train of thought, if you live in an area with a high crime rate, you're statistically less likely to repay credit. This can have an impact.

The system isn't always perfect. But the rise of CRAs in the UK has been pushed hard since the market crash. This is one way of protecting people from lenders pushing far too large a loan on people.

&gt; And how do you guys have all this information? 

The banks/lenders/utilities/services companies/government did though. Every credit account you take out in the UK has it written into the contract that you agree with the creditor sharing this information with the CRAs. CRAs also make heavy use of publicly accessible information, such as electoral roll records.

Some people still have accounts from before CRAs existed. Most will have been updated with new contracts that include sharing the information. But occasionally people do come through the system and the account hasn't been shared with us. It's pretty rare.

&gt; I never gave it to you. 

See above, you agreed to other people giving it over as part of the credit agreement. You wont find credit in the UK where you don't agree to it.

&gt; And why do I have to pay to access information about me? 

If you want the information for yourself. Feel free to collect/store/index it yourself and never pay a CRA. What you're paying for is the CRA doing all that work and then processing the data to give it back to you. Our electricity bills are huge for all of this processing.

Creditors will pay us to process that information on you. Even if you never look at it yourself, someone will pay to access it at some point.

&gt; Why can't I just pay the 10 or so pounds admin fee for a freedom of information request? 

CRAs have to provide you with everything we know about you for £2. Much less than an FOI request. All 3 agencies will give you the information immediately for that £2.

&gt; And why are there three, 

To stop there being a monopoly on the information. The creditors like having competition in the CRA world. It keeps us competitive and cheap.

&gt; and why would they have different results?

Because we take information from creditors. If one of them doesn't tell CRA (3) about some information then CRA (3) doesn't know it. CRAs are not allowed to pass information about consumers between each other. We put lots of effort into having the most accurate information we can.",0,1417795311,null,0,false,0,cmm1uou,t3_2ocls2,t1_cmm1uou,t1_cmm12t5,null,1425590039,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

As for the sexually banned content such as 'fisting' and 'female ejaculate' or anything to do with waste, of which I personally dislike seeing, they all should be allowed under the XXX rating so long as no crime has accord and it is done between consenting adults and their contents is listed beforehand. Snuff films and child pornography of course will still be banned but roleplay should be allowed, and in fact is already shown, although not for pornographic reasons, in a Clockwork Orange which frankly I don't want banned again.

false,ggow,null,null,"I've never understood this idea. If England were an independent nation right now, taking a look at its local government structures, it would be absurd to look to Scotland for a comparison. The population size and distribution are completely different. The more obvious comparators are the large mainland European countries, like France and Germany. England would probably benefit from assemblies somewhere between the French and Germany level of competence. 

Bringing that in to the context of the UK's constitution, it does create the surface level inequality of the different home nations being treated differently. Is that really an issue though?

An English Parliament would have an enormous budget, rivalling the UK Government's budget. London and the South East would be even more dominant than it currently is, possibly to the detriment of the North. The majority of the regional government would remain at the same distance to the regions as Westminster currently is, so there'd be no efficiency gains but just extra cost. You'd have a great deal of constitutional imbalance in that probably the most powerful politician in the UK would be England's First Minister, over whom the other home nations would have no say in electing. Arguably, the imbalances, injustices, and inefficiencies outweigh the need for surface-level equality; England is ten-times the size of the next closest Home Nation, it doesn't make sense to treat in exactly the same way. All that matters is that it's fair and a good system of government, surely?

Personally, I think the identity issues are overblown. The other home nations managed to maintain their distinctive identities, sometimes in the face of central government attempts to quash them. England's, with a long and rich shared history and strong common interests (like the football team, for instance) is not going to disappear because of the introduction of strong regional government. 

I'd also say the ideas of city rivalries being a problem are way overblown. Everywhere has those.

Secondly, the definition of ""Public office"" is: a position of authority or service involving responsibility to the public, especially within the government.

I think the studio cuts for a lower certificate issue is an industry problem and not an actual problem with the BBFC and seems to be part of a wider issue of dumbing down films for wider audiences (Terminator 3 seems to be a good example of this). 
Doesn't seem that the BBFC cuts many films any more, [Old article from 2006 I found says its around 3% compared to 27% in the 1970s](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/sep/01/filmcensorship) (If anyone can get more recent figures I'd like to see them) and having read what they said about films that were banned in more recent times like The Human Centipede 2 it does seem to stack up about why they banned it in the first place. 
I am a bit undecided on the 12A issue though, having myself seen Spider-Man eight years old in 2002 and being one of the first benefactors of the changed rating. While I have found most if not all 12A films that I saw before I was actually 12 pretty fine I understand that for some children may of not been the same.

Part of this is you cannot ""not"" pay it back, assuming you earn over the threshold to pay it back. So you can't be bad with money and mess it up.

If you live together and have done for some time, then there is a good chance the CRAs have pieced that together (from bank addresses and from electoral roll data). So your credit rating may already take some ""shared responsibility"" into account. A joint bank account solidifies this relationship according to a CRA.

if you find you need to improve your rating for any reason (or you want to have a high rating for the future), ie. you may get a mortgage later and you'll both want a high rating for that. Then there are a few cost free things you can do.

* Credit cards. Don't abuse them, but do use them. Pay them off at the end of every month. Let the limit on the card increase over time. Technically you can get a boost to your rating even if you don't use the card at all (ie. order it and cut it up straight away) but the boost is much higher if you sensibly use the card. Personally I buy lunch at work every day on that card and pay it all off just before payday.
* Overdraft, see above on credit cards. In this case, don't use it. But let the limit grow as the bank allow you.
* Store cards, especially interest free ones.
* As you've already said, joint accounts.

&gt; MEPs also get staff allowances of almost £200,000 per year paid through an independent agent, which some use to employ family members. Farage himself employs his wife, Kirsten, on a salary of up to £20,000 a year.

I believe the difference between MEP's ""allowances"" and (for example) MP's expenses is that MEPs don't have to account for their allowances. I believe Farage has used these allowances to fund UKIP party activities in the past.

If we had paid the same amount for Bale, it would have been ludicrously overpriced, but ultimately worth it, although granted this fictional scenario differs in that Bale didn't get constant stick about being a club record purchase.

Personally I don't really gaf about the fee. It's not like he got that money. There were better deals on the market but this sub was overjoyed when we got him, so it's not like we really have a right to complain that the club spent too much on him now.

I think part of it is we expected him to just fit in the squad and be Bale Jr. right off the bat, and that expectation has gone unfulfilled. He's still really talented with a ton of upside. We know he scores incredible goals (mainly in EL, but also with Argentina against Germany). We know he makes good passes.

He'll almost definitely never be as good as Bale, but even Bale didn't really break out until he was around as old as Lamela is now, and the team overall was far more stable then anyway (and in the CL...). So I think we should put off this conversation until later when we see how the team identity has evolved and where Lamela fits in it.

How tense your limbs are can have a massive impact.

For legs: these should snugly grip the tank, with your knees in. If your knees are sticking out at all, your balance can go to shit.  
For arms: these should be loose, and there's no need for a titan-tight grip on the handlebars. Reduce any tenseness by dropping your shoulders and bringing your elbows in.

My *guess* is that while sitting further back, your feet are at the same position on the pegs. Therefore, to feel more comfortable, you need to draw your knees inward.  
Likewise, your arms need a bit more stretch, so the shoulders get dropped to give more reach, and the elbows get brought in.

To test with the legs, if you can [and weren't already], in your old seating position, pull your feet back so it's just the balls of your feet on the pegs. Then, ensure your knees are touching the tank on both sides.

Also would like to see someone like McQueen getting a bit of time at the end if Mane is still doing his headless chicken running (sometimes he'll manage something, but a lot of the time he won't). Sometimes I think you couldn't do much worse than Mane by bringing on one of our youths, even if he is still someone I like because of his attacking mindset.

You gotta realise that any party in which one of their main policies is reducing immigration would attract 'undesirables' who have backward views.

Early in his career in UKIP, he essentially purged UKIP of anybody who held racist views. He's made it impossible to join UKIP if you've previously been part of any far-right group. Whenever anyone in UKIP makes a gaff, Nigel does one of two things.

a) He disciplines the UKIP member who's embarrassed the party, and emphasises that what was expressed does not reflect the views of the party.

b) In the case of the super-christian minister who blamed the floods on gay marriage, chalk it off to differences in opinion, emphasise that the views expressed by this individual do not reflect the views of the party, and argue that there should be more room for people speaking their honest views in politics.

I agree with everything Nigel has done in response to the gaffs made by people related to UKIP.

I must say, Suzanne Evans is brilliant. Up until recently, it was acceptable to argue that UKIP were a one-man party. Now, it's certainly not the case with two extremely well educated and sensible Tories joining in Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless. (Mark Reckless is a bit boring though.)
