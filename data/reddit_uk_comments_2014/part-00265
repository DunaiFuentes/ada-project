true,secretlymonday,null,null,"Hi  guys. 
Fellow CDN living in Scotland for years, and while I don't want to turn you off, you should understand that its pretty darn expensive in this city - main thing that's different is that you also have to pay ""council tax"" on top of your rent, and this is slightly different cost in every part of the city... factor in a good extra £100 per month just to be safe! If you are single person living in a flat, you can apply for a 25% discount, but either way, its an extra charge that most CDN's no realise they have to pay, and often is a big downfall. 

The city itself isn't big, so as long as you're in the central area, you won't be far away from anything and it all connects to the centre. While it might be a bit more run-down, places like Leith are super fun, quite cheap and, yes, close to bars and pubs. Nothing in Edinburgh is really that far away, unless you start living in West Lothian area or something. 

Just to warn you about letting agencies too - they are lying, thieving sharks who will fuck you for all they can. My advice would be to go for something privately on Gumtree or other private routes - that way you could also possibly avoid the whole ""references"" trouble, too - ie, set up a good relationship, have letters from parents or school teachers just as back-ups, etc.  

If you are going the rental agency route, you might be able to just say one of you is renting, and then just sneak the other person in. Either that or say that you are a couple, and then sort out the living room/bedroom thing later. Rental in this city just isn't really suited for young 'uns (sorry) who don't have that sort of cash available. Thats been my experience anyways.

And now that I have more time here are the reasons.

An Unearthly Child: This actually is one of the best introductory episodes of Who ever. You really get a sense of each character and who they will be in the first series.

The Daleks: This one is kind of a no brainer as it will introduce you to the titular creatures as well as a bit of their background mythos: Skaro, Kaleds, Thaals, etc.

The Edge of Destruction: This episode gives you more of the TARDIS to see and sees some really stellar turns by the cast. It is the first episode to only feature the TARDIS itself. It is a really great stir crazy tale and it is a pretty taut thriller for most of its run.

The Keys of Marinus: This is one of their first attempts at a much more varied story with different settings and plots although on the same planet. Similar in idea to The Key to Time series that shows up in the Fourth Doctor's tenure but much more compact.

The Aztecs: This one is the first time that the series really examines the ethics of time travel as Barbara is taken to be an ancient goddess/priestess and wants to use her status to stop human sacrifices.

As for the rest, it would be best to skip a good deal of the missing episode serials for now although in the future there would be some that I would highly suggest.

EDIT: FINE

TL;DR I have been mastering dreams through Lucid Dreaming, so much so that I have them all the time now. But last night I had something I've never experienced before. I don't want to say it was a vision, but it definitely was not a normal dream. I was with The Doctor, and he was dying. I felt more emotion than I've ever felt, and it was 
an intense experience. 

I felt like what was happened was through someone else's eyes, but I felt every single thing 100 percent.
Here's what I can remember.


The Doctor is dying, at one point he goes unconscious. In the end, he falls into _____ arms with a look of such pure pain on his face. I scream for him to hold on, to fight what's happening to him, to hold onto the memories and not to quit. I am so sure something will happen, he will live, he HAS to win. Just incase, I tell him that I will not leave him, and no matter what I will be there for him. In my arms, he cracks into pieces and collapses into nothing, no goodbye, not even a look to confirm he understood, he just died. Died the worst death I've ever seen. My being is so broken that I feel nothing and try to carry on with the others that are also there. It'll only last until I'm alone.

This is what happened. I have seen maybe 3 episode of Doctor Who and am not even that big of a fan, I hadn't watched it recently, and am confused on how I could even possibly dream of these things. I don't understand it, and that's strange because I make an effort to understand and master my dreams. But this was different. I woke up feeling destroyed inside and still don't feel normal a few days later. I've been marathoning Doctor Who ever since and it feel's really strange. I may not remember the entire dream, but I will never in life forget how I felt.",0,1410245513,null,0,1410311987,0,ckd8xrf,t3_2fvevq,t1_ckd8xrf,t3_2fvevq,null,1427113139,7,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,7

&gt; **[What is the Mises Institute?](http://mises.org/page/1479/Frequently-Asked-Questions)**

&gt; The Mises Institute is a research center, founded as a 501(c)(3) organization in 1982, that is dedicated to supporting the intellectual tradition, particularly in economic and political theory, represented by Ludwig von Mises (1881-1973), who taught in Vienna, Geneva, and New York. The Mises Institute, founded with the blessing of Mises's widow, Margit (1890-1993), who served as chairman, sponsors teaching programs and professional meetings, publishes journals and books, makes available audio and video, offers student assistance, and otherwise provides a wide range of services to uphold the Misesian tradition. **The Mises Institute is not a ""think tank"" in the conventional sense because it serves no political party, offers no revolving door for public officials, nor seeks to embroil itself in the pseudo-sciences of social and economic management. Rather, the Mises Institute backs research and writing in defense of Austrian economics, the market economy, private property, sound money, and peaceful international relations, while opposing government intervention as economically and socially destructive.**",0,1410245792,null,0,1410245991,0,ckd8zwx,t3_2fvbgs,t1_ckd8zwx,t1_ckd6idw,null,1427113111,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I have a friend who does magistrate work. He suggested that the majority of cases in magistrates for TV licence issues which he's experienced are single parents families, families on benefits and other people who give off the vibe of not much money or education. This makes sense as avoiding paying TV licencing fees isn't challenging at all due the the TV licence people actually having no authority.

I don't have a TV Licence, but I don't have a television and I don't watch live streams. This isn't to say I don't want to watch BBC news live - I would love to, but I don't watch it because I don't pay for it. I'm not willing to pay ~£140 for one TV channel, in the same way I'm not prepared to buy a large multipack of crisps if I only intend on eating 1 packet.

If I was given the option to pay specifically for the TV channels and content that I wanted, then I would happily pay the right amount (assuming in was reasonably priced - not sure what I'd class as reasonably priced, but some price relative to the current pricing of lots of channels for £140/ year). Until then, I'm happy to get my news and entertainment from other more cost effective and sensibly billed sources.

edit: regarding decriminalising it, I'm not sure that would be the right thing to do - using a service and not paying for it *is* theft and theft *is* a criminal act, regardless of how 'justified' it might be.

As raw data it really doesn't tell us anything expect the data on the religious convictions of the UK prison population, yet I have no doubt that it's the kind of data that bigots would latch on to in a truly awful attempt to make a point about immigration or some such, or to make farcical claims about Muslims being more predisposed to commit crimes. 

I've seen this kind of thing before you see, only used to make comments about the black British population. It's highly misleading. A rich black businessman is no more or less likely to commit a crime than a rich white one. Same for a poor black or poor white kid on an inner city London housing estate. But of course black British are disproportionately under-represented if you look only at ""rich businessmen"" as a data set, and over-represented if you look at inner city London housing estates. If our prisons have more people from inner city London housing estates than the do rich businessmen, then you would clearly have an over-representation of black British. 

Taking religion, or race, data for prisoners and drawing conclusions from that feature alone is simply nonsense. Even without data analysis it should be fairly obvious (except of course to the bigot) that neither factor has much relevance to criminality.

The old school tip: If you've got no time for ironing, keep whatever wrinkled garment you have in your bathroom (behind the shower curtain!) while you take a hot shower. The steam will reduce the creases like magic!

Pack a variety of appropriate clothing for your hall/flat room! Clubbing dresses, business-casual trousers and blouses, super-casual lounging outfits.

true,CD17,null,null,"Hey, great choice of city! Although as /u/secretlymonday points out, this is an expensive city! I'll try to answer your questions as best I can.

Some quick back-of-the-envelope maths shows that you'll likely come out with a combined net monthly income in the region of around £1500+ (assuming you both get waitressing jobs for 35 hours a week at minimum wage, which for an [18 year old is £5.13](https://www.gov.uk/national-minimum-wage-rates) as of October 1st). This is definitely doable for a flat in the region of £595, and while you won't be saving a great deal, you won't be going hungry either. I live in a flat with a £595 rent with a net income of £1600, and it's far from uncomfortable with regards to money issues.

Be aware though, there is a housing shortage in this city. The flat your letting agent showed you is likely already gone; I saw flats go within less than 24 hours when I was looking. You'll have to be quick! I'm not sure what the situation is with not being allowed to share a 1-bed flat (I can't find anything to disallow it, and a house doesn't reach [HMO](https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/houses-in-multiple-occupation) status until 3 people live there).

As for areas of the city, as a rough rule of thumb (please correct me if I'm wrong), everything inside the Edinburgh City Bypass up to the Firth of Forth is classed as Edinburgh. If you're interested in being on a bus route to the town centre, check out [Lothian Buses](http://lothianbuses.com/services/day-service) to see where services stop and how often. I live quite far from the city centre (~4 miles), but as I live on the 22 bus route (and also the tram route), it only takes 15-20 minutes to get to Princes Street.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any more questions :)

*Primark* - Step away from Primark. You might think you're saving money, but you're not. The store is great for simple t-shirts and shoes for knocking about, but don't rely on it for your every day needs. You'll end up majorly disappointed. 

My Primark favourites are:

* Bamboo socks. They have a really high bamboo content, similar to other high end brands at a fraction of the cost. These socks are so soft, comfortable and allow your feet to breathe more than cotton.

* Underwear. Not bras mind you, but their multi pack of underwear while not long wearing are good in a pinch. Plus they're the only place I can find that sell all black in sets.

* Novelty shirts. I'm a big nerd and Primark has got a licencing deal with all these companies to sell official mercy. As it's going to winter wear all those t-shirts are half off right now. 

* Jumpers. Halls can get cold. Really cold. Primark Mens have really comfy indoor baggy jumpers. Plus a lot of them are licensed, meaning the quality is just a touch better.

When you're going shopping, always try to go for quality over quantity. When I left university, I ended up binning half of my wardrobe because I'd bought so much tat and novelty stuff. Speaking of dress up nights, try and reuse stuff in your wardrobe! If you can't, then try and rent over buying, or see if someone else has a costume you can borrow. As fun as my dress up nights were, the ones I remember being the most fun are the times I cobbled a dress out of a bin bag, rather than the ones I spend £40 buying in.

*Buy good boots* - I can strongly recommend two retailers. Joules for wellies, and Jones. Jones have student discount. The prices are quite high, but you well have those shoes for so long that it'll be worth the initial cost. You won't have to worry about the soles falling out for a long time.

*Ask for student discount everywhere* - When I was a student, I was always a bit afraid to ask for student discount initially. I didn't want to be seen as cheap. I missed out on so many offers out of fear. Seriously, ask everywhere. They might say no, but that's the worst they can say! UniDays is great, they are free and you get discounts on a lot of online clothing retailers, as well as in store in places like GAP.

*Shop in odd places* TopShop is overpriced and everyone will be shopping there. You're not a clone, you're a delicate ninja flower. Shop in odd places. Mix and match a plain t-shirt with shorts from Matalan. 

*Washing your clothes* OH MY GOD, I can't believe I almost forgot about this. Pre-soak your undoes in a sink in you room, then put them in a net and then in the wash. That way they don't get mangled and you'll always have all your socks.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;  If our prisons have more people from inner city London housing estates than the do rich businessmen, then you would clearly have an over-representation of black British.

I agree, its not the colour of a persons skin, or even their religion which makes them more or less likely to commit crime, it is the culture that they are brought up in.

Black people are over represented in prison because there are more black people who are [poor as a percentage of the black population](http://www.irr.org.uk/research/statistics/poverty/) than is the case for the white population. This leads to a greater chance of them living in a high crime area, and themselves committing crime. That is not a statement made in judgement, its just a fact of society, and it reflects badly on our society in general. 

The reason the black population of prisons is disproportionately high is that it is more likely for a black person to be brought up with a **culture** of being poor, and of crime being a way of life. 

Now, as we have seen, there is a disproportionately high number of Muslims in prison. So could it be because of the **culture** that many Muslims are brought up in? Are there any similarities between the two? and are things the same for Muslims across the country? 

Well the majority of Muslims in this country live in communities with high Muslim populations, and many have been described as isolated, with no  [community cohesion.](https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/research/urbanchange/muslims/) It is this that makes it easy for criminal behaviour to spread.

 There has been lost of evidence for this. Extremism is obviously one thing that can breed in such areas. Also, there have been many cases of child sex grooming involving Muslim men, to such an extent that most people now agree that the local culture of the communities played a part. 

There has also been instances of local communities wishing to police themselves, and rarely if ever calling the police to deal with problems within. 

All of this leads to a greater chance within these communities for crimes to be committed, and makes the high prison population of Muslims understandable. ",0,1410253100,null,0,false,0,ckdacqi,t3_2ftk3y,t1_ckdacqi,t1_ckda2t9,null,1427112478,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The vast majority of people in prison are Christian (24% Anglican, 17% Roman Catholic, 7% 'other' Christian). Most Christians are over the age of 45 and outside prison irreligion outstrips all religions under the age of 35. By rights the vast majority of prisons should contain irreligious men.

The muslim population is on the increase at the highest rate but it's still not up to the levels of other religions. Being part of the fastest growing smallest group is not a point to base a complete argument on.

Add to that the 38% agnostic and you've got 85% of the prison population - more than 60% of whom are under 30, male and from poor areas. Go figure.

People who 'say' they're muslim are 14% not all of them are actually muslim.

Roman Catholics are over represented in prisons. People converting to any form of Christianity is in no way a significant number.

30% of Muslims converted inside less than 3% of the total popn - not enough to change overall stats but enough to greatly skew the 14% figure. A significant amount of those are because they get special dietary privileges and prayer time. They're known as  'convenience Muslims' and it's been widely reported - so you can probably halve that number and go back to your Daily Mail.

You also have to take in to account that young, disaffected, unemployed males from poor areas are vastly more likely to get in to trouble with the law - a number skewed towards Muslim males.

So it's not about special treatment, every member state has some flexibility when it comes to the EU, and it's likely that Scotland, especially in the future, will desire even less ""special treatment"" than the rest of the UK which is probably the nation in the EU which demands the most opt-outs for itself because of it's significant euroskeptic streak.

Although, I'm sorry to say that, even if you take legal action against your ex and are successful, you'll be lucky to find a judge willing to issue any kind of sentence against the mother of a child. Usually she'll be told to allow you access or face fines and maybe a custodial sentence, which she'll then be free to ignore as she will probably realise that this is a toothless threat in most cases due to the current state of the UK legal system.

I'd also speak to these guys [Fathers4Justice](http://www.fathers-4-justice.org/) for support as there are pleanty of Fathers there in the same postion as you who'll be able to offer much better advice and support.

true,arselona,null,null,"I would counter by saying that despite being a figure of fun to many, John Prescott was the Deputy PM for an awful long time, and DPM is an unmistakable a position of power. Further, I would be inclined to believe that he would not have pushed ahead on a project with such a potentially huge impact without party support. The creation of the London assembly was one part of this process.

I would also point to Labour's devolution policy for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. I think that in many ways New Labour was an extension of Tory policies but with a centre left coating, and devolution followed this process.

After all, central control is a hallmark characteristic of the Left is it not, and small government that of the Right?

Devolution/Federalisation is part of a long term destiny for the UK. English people want it. Welsh people want it, even Londoners want much more autonomy. It will come. However, how we get there is the question and the problem.

Do we lead with politics and expect the economy to catch up, or do we lead with the market and let the politics follow and reflect the new status quo?

I think in many ways this comes down to whether you have faith in 'the man' or 'the market'. 

This is a lot like the Eurozone debacle where a forced political project was launched, with the aim of fudging the economy into a new shape. Obviously it has been, and continues to be an absolute disaster, with perhaps the worst still to come by the end of 2015. 

Regional assemblies and devolution were seen as the solution by Labour, while the Tories would favour regional development and deregulation in order to boost economic activity across the UK. 

Baring all this in mind, when I see Lib Dems pushing for federalisation, and Tories aiming to boost regional development, I see the same end goal, but different interpretations of how the real economy works. Professionally, my experience leads me to consider the later option the most likely to succeed.

I think that regional economic autonomy is one of the main aspirations for the Tories. It is consistent with their identity, and perhaps the manoeuvrings of New Labour in their pivot to the centre ground twisted that classical left/right interpretation of the role central Government should play.

I understand that the Tories are a dirty name in Scotland, and thats a whole different conversation for a different thread, and that Thatchers response to the prior Labour IMF collapse made Scotland perma-Left. I get all that, but I think its worth noting that once the personal hatred is put aside, it should be noted that it was a Tory PM who gave Scotland the opportunity to chose its own destiny. A true nasty party would behave as is seen in Spain/Catalonia, and deny all legality and opportunity.

TLDR: Chick/Egg - Federalisation/ Regional Development - Tomato/Tomatoe - the difference is whether you lead with the politics or economy first. One implies more government layered on top of government, the other implies less government and market led solutions.

There's not a high incident of converts. There's a high incident of people 'claiming to be Muslim' as part of that small group. It represents an overall, very small percentage. People aren't converting to Roman Catholicism in prison by any recognisable number. Church attendance inside isn't up it's down.

Catholics are massively overrepresented in prisons as a slice of the population even though people are leaving it in droves for other flavours.

C3, probably just over 1/2 the questions follow that format, and just under 1/2 you must have the insight/inspiration to get to the end.

C4, same thing it's just over 1/2 that you need the inspiration.

So there are basically 3 ways to deal with this if you want a good overall grade.

1. Be a math genius on the day of the exam, and show it, so you have all those necessary moments of inspiration in C3/C4

2. Work hard throughout the year - include work outside class, beyond homework, doing questions by yourself.  You will be amazed how much easier inspiration comes, if you have done lots of similar problems and immersed yourself in the subject over the whole year (and not just for a month or two before the exam).

3. Work hard in C1, C2, S1, M1 (or whichever other papers you do), and bank as many marks as you can in these subjects.   You then don't need to do as well in C3/C4 to get a good overall grade.

My suggestion is the best strategy is to combine 2 &amp; 3.  Because even if you are a genuine math genius, it's really hard to perform at your best on the day of the exam and under pressure.


And you know what else you can do:

Go to a charity shop, and buy an A2 revision/course book.  I've seen the CGP ones, that are pretty good, for 99p.

Look at the book, see if you can follow.  Then go to the Edexcel website, download some papers &amp; mark schemes which basically give you the answer, and have a good at applying techniques from the book to do a question on that topic.  Rinse and repeat.

You don't have to wait for your teacher to spoon feed you everything.

Tesco and Sainsbury are the best places, both have large stores in beeston and smaller stores in Lenton and the town centre. Toasters, microwaves and kettles are provided, you will have your own small fridge.

In terms of furnishing your room, you shouldn't need to buy anything and remember that you have to remove anything you buy from the room at the end of each term. There are posters and stuff sold on campus, there will be many half price sales in the first few weeks.

If you are living in self catered accommodation  (all off campus) the above still applies BUT you might need to buy a kettle, toaster etc. Don't buy this stiff before you arrive as the usual thing to do is get together with the rest of the people in your flat (4-8 people usually ) and buy them so you dont end up with 8 toasters.

As far as what I've done to help me out: I read through the history on the [Everton website](http://www.evertonfc.com). It's really really quite interesting and informative. Second, just watching the game and being involved in the discussions during the transfer season will help you learn quickly! Wherever you are, see if there's a pub airing the games on Saturdays -- if you're lucky, there will be an Evertonian around :) (I say that because I think there's only one other of us in my town, and we somehow manage to never be there when the other is).

I hope all of that will help, and I anticipate you'll get some awesome comments from other fans as well. Welcome again!",0,1410257336,null,0,1410264034,0,ckdb1cu,t3_2fvqtl,t1_ckdb1cu,t3_2fvqtl,null,1427112159,2,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,2

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;In the 2011 Census, Christianity was the largest religion, with 33.2 million people (59.3 per cent of the population). The second largest religious group were Muslims with 2.7 million people (4.8 per cent of the population).

Christians as a percentage of prision population 50% - UNDER REPRESENTED

Muslims as a percentage of prision population 14% - OVER REPRESENTED.

&gt;30% of Muslims converted inside less than 3% of the total popn - not enough to change overall stats but enough to greatly skew the 14% figure. A significant amount of those are because they get special dietary privileges and prayer time. They're known as 'convenience Muslims' and it's been widely reported - so you can probably halve that number and go back to your Daily Mail.

Ok lets massively OVER estimate the number of converts at 50%, instead of 30% like the data shows. What are we left with? A 7% Muslim prison population. STILL over represented compared to the general public. 

And of course that assumes that every single convert only converted to get better meals, because everyone knows nobody undergoes any real change in their beliefs and behaviour while they are in prison. /s

&gt;You also have to take in to account that young, disaffected, unemployed males from poor areas are vastly more likely to get in to trouble with the law - a number skewed towards Muslim males.

Yes, that exactly what I said, but that is no excuse for them breaking the law. It is the culture that you are brought up around that affects your behaviour.

I couldn't legally watch freeview on a TV without paying my license fee, so lets assume the TV license actually pays for access to 50 channels (it's actually more, but for maths sake)

So 39p a day pays for all channels, that puts the value of each channel at less than 1p a day. But lets round it up, for maths sake, and say each channel is worth 1p /day.

(I don't use netflix, so I don't know why that comes into the equation. I use on demand TV services like 4OD and iPlayer and I buy DVDs of content I want - although I am considering Netflix instead, but I'm not comfortable with not being able to buy and own creative content I like).

If we accept that 1p a day is the price for a single channel. Is 20p that much to ask for 1 channel, considering they're all valued at less than 1p by the provider itself? Yes.

true,TheresanotherJoswell,eng-northumberland,Northumberland,"&gt;Citation needed. Tourists come to see the palaces and the jewels, not the Royals. Even Buckingham isn't that popular. Legoland gets more visitors annually.

Citation needed indeed, but I don't have any statistical evidence. The worldwide fascination with the royal family however is abundantly obvious. Global coverage of the Royal Wedding and the birth of Prince George attests to this. 

&gt;Citation needed. If you're talking about the tax paid 'voluntarily' (scoff, since when was my PAYE tax voluntary?) from the Crown estates - this never actually belonged to the Royals in the first place. 

I'm not talking about tax actually, but that's a good point. Who cares if they are paying tax voluntarily? The fact is, they are paying tax. It just so happens that the Queen is unable to force through legislation to make her taxation mandatory, and you cannot possibly call this her fault. The fact that they actually pay tax is actually a very strong reason as to why they are no ""scroungers"".

I was in fact referring to Crown Estate, and if you hade done your research you would know that the Crown Estate actually *did* belong to the Royal Family. It was their property as much as anything that can ever be owned by anyone, and was:

""surrendered to the Parliament of Great Britain in return for a fixed civil list payment – the monarch retains the income from the Duchy of Lancaster.""

Contractually, they are entitled to their civil list payment; and as such their claim to said payment is as strong as any claimant in a contract agreement.

&gt;You mean like good old Prince Phil? The racist, sexist caricature who regularly travels the world insulting people? What about the rest of them who we never see with their dozens of children, who lead very private lives holidaying in the Alps for six months of the year?

Yeah, exactly like him. Wether he is good in this capacity or not, the fact is that emmisarial tours are work, and they are important. Somebody willing to work cannot be described as a scrounger, in my opinion.

&gt;Millions of working class people have served in the forces and have been paid appropriately. Let us not forget William was 'parachuted' (excuse the pun) into an extremely desirable Apache helicopter gunship role despite performing very averagely at university.

Yes, and I'm completely unwilling to describe these millions of working class people as scroungers. You, however, seem to be willing to make an exception  for the royals for no other reason than the fact that they're from a certain family. Quite ironic actually, when you seem to be arguing against preferential/discriminatory treatment based on lineage.

&gt;I'll stop calling them scroungers when we stop calling benefit claimants scroungers and hounding them out of their homes with ridiculous 'bedroom taxes' - whilst we fawn over this lot in their 40 bedroom palaces like they're any better.

Fucking yes dude, let's do both. The point is, they aren't mutually exclusive. We need a better welfare state, but that doesn't mean we have to scrap the monarchy.

So much wrong in this statement I don't even know where to begin. There is no wear on the clutch when you start it in neutral without it depressed. The clutch bearing is not putting pressure on the pressure plate, the clutch friction plate is sandwiched inbetween the pressure plate and the flywheel so there's no slip. However when you do have it depressed you're placing force on the clutch release bearing and the clutch pressure plate fingers. When you release the clutch you then wear a few microns off the friction plate as the static clutch friction plate comes into contact with a flywheel on one side and a pressure plate on the other side spinning at 800RPM. 

Clutch wear occurs as a result of a clutch friction plate turning at one speed coming into contact with the flywheel and pressure plate spinning at a different speed. ",0,1410260535,null,0,false,0,ckdbll0,t3_2fw21p,t1_ckdbll0,t1_ckdb6hp,null,1427111897,5,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,5

true,TakenByVultures,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"&gt;Citation needed indeed, but I don't have any statistical evidence. The worldwide fascination with the royal family however is abundantly obvious. Global coverage of the Royal Wedding and the birth of Prince George attests to this. 

I'm not disputing their popularity. I'm disputing the link you're making between popularity and tourism. 

&gt;I was in fact referring to Crown Estate, and if you hade done your research you would know that the Crown Estate actually did belong to the Royal Family. It was their property as much as anything that can ever be owned by anyone, and was:

Republic.co.uk put this better than I do;

*The Crown Estate is a land and property portfolio, managed on behalf of the Government, whose surplus revenue is paid annually to the Treasury.*

*It is sometimes claimed that the
Queen “surrenders” Crown Estate
revenue to the nation, subsidising the
monarchy through a personal
financial sacrifice. In fact, as the
Crown Estate itself puts it, “The
property we manage is owned by the
Crown but is not the private property
of the monarch.”*

*The source of the confusion comes
from the fact that a small part of the
existing Crown Estate portfolio was
the property of the monarch before
the end of the 18th century, when the
king had responsibility for the
expenses of civil government.
But this changed once the state (the
Crown) and the person of the
monarch became separate during the
reign of George III. Since then the
Crown Estate has been the
“hereditary possessions of the
Sovereign”, not the personal
possessions of the individual acting as
Sovereign.*

*If the monarchy were to disappear
tomorrow, the Crown Estate would
continue to do what it has always
done for nearly one thousand years - provide income for the administration
of this country.*

&gt;Yeah, exactly like him. Wether he is good in this capacity or not, the fact is that emmisarial tours are work, and they are important. Somebody willing to work cannot be described as a scrounger, in my opinion.

It *certainly* matters whether he's any good in this capacity or not.

If the Scots want to pay for BBC access, but have no legal way to do so, blocking them from using proxies only achieves a few things:

- It lightens the load on the BBC servers a bit
- It makes the BBC content seem a bit more valuable, due to artificial scarcity. But since the interested parties can't get it and those who can won't like a price hike, this point is mostly void.
- It reduces the exposure of BBC programs, and by extension their brand value
- It creates additional work for the BBC

So more work for less value and petty revenge.

On the other hand if you skip the revenge reason, you retain your viewership and funding. And you won't have to block new proxy servers every day.

Most BBC content is actually pretty easy to get on youtube for viewers outside of the UK.

Because the transactions are illegal, the market itself is forced to operate outside the formal economy, supported by the established state power. Common motives for operating in black markets are to trade contraband, avoid taxes, or skirt price controls.

        * The cost of the civil government
    
        * The national debt accrued by previous monarchs, and his own personal debt.

&gt; In return, he received an annual grant known as the Civil List. By tradition, each subsequent monarch has agreed to this formality as part of the ritual of his or her accession. However, from 1 April 2012, under the terms of the Sovereign Grant Act 2011 (SSG), the Civil List was abolished, and in the future each monarch will receive from the Treasury a stipulated percentage of the Crown Estate's annual net revenue (currently set at 15%). [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Estate)

So, the crown estates were effectively bought out by the government to pay off the debts of the monarchy and to pay for future upkeep of the estates. 

The queen/king was originally expected to pay for the Civil Service, judges' and ambassadors' salaries and the payment of their pensions, as well as the expenses of the Royal Household and the Sovereign's personal expenses.

This kind of stuff happens all the time to me - well, I rarely go over my overdraft limit, but cashflow and late payments do mean I'm cutting it close a lot of the time. My credit score is pretty damn good, and I have no idea why, because I've not exactly been careful with my overdraft.

In future, a few things to consider:

1. A credit card **for business purposes only** might be a good idea. It helps level out cashflow, and as long as you pay it in full every month it means you get a little longer on those late invoices. It's also really useful if, for example, your PC dies mid-way through a massive project and you can't get a new one until you're paid and you can't get paid until you get a new one :(
2. Get on top of cashflow and invoicing. Monday morning is for sending out new invoices and chasing late ones. Chasing doesn't have to be hard or aggressive. Some companies (especially small ones) just forget, or invoices get mixed in big piles of paperwork; there's rarely any malice. Big companies drag out invoice payments as long as possible but will respond to (near constant) badgering. Send automated, or automated-looking, invoice reminders once a week for the first couple of weeks. Then every few days. Then call and ask to talk to accounts payable. Then do this every single day until you get an answer about why payment is late and when it can be expected. You should also remember your statutory late payment charges (https://www.gov.uk/late-commercial-payments-interest-debt-recovery) and *use them*. I waive them for small businesses but any big business is reminded of them in every invoice or quote related bit of paperwork, and I charge them to the letter on this. They don't pay late more than once or twice.
3. Charge smaller amounts more often, i.e. set payment milestones for projects (25% up front, 50% on delivery, 25% when final training complete, for example).
4. Save as much as possible when times are good. You should have the biggest buffer you can possible manage. You should pay yourself the smallest wage you can conceivably get away with and still be comfortable, then pay yourself dividends once/twice a year when you know your tax situation. I've done this for years and my dividends have just paid for a good chunk of our wedding.

That's the issue though, it's not going to happen.

If you're from a rich family and/or your parents are happy with you living at home, you can take an unpaid internship and it's still a net positive for you. You get experience (tricky to get otherwise) because you can afford to not be paid any living expenses. Like it or not, being known as the kid who reported a company because they gave him an internship is going to do you no favours when you're trying to find a job in 6 months.

But if you can't afford to work unpaid, you'll just not look for unpaid internships.

As for why OSM height data is a load of rubbish, I assume it's because they haven't actually done a proper survey like the Ordnance Survey do. They've certainly not had their volunteers tramp over every square metre of the countryside recording heights.

I hear a lot of the time about how people are excited, and how people are being swept up into fervour.  What I don't hear so much about are:

- this division of the country would have knock on effects that we're already getting a taste of.  People who previously would have got on fine are put into categories with names like 'unionists' etc.  I saw a thread the other day where a guy wasn't sure how to convince his father... so now the son loses respect for the father, and perhaps vice-versa, over a situation that normally wouldn't have even existed.
- people who are English, Welsh or Northern Irish are seeing their current country completely changed, and they have no way of keeping the country together if that is what they want.  This is already leading to people resenting one another in this country when there was friendship before.
- if independence begin, they'll then begin a huge sideshow of carving everything up.  This will cost a lot of money, and that money could have been spent on health, education, infrastructure... but won't be.  Because it has to be spent establishing a new independent country.  So there'll be a great distraction for any failings for the next 30 years as people can point to independence and say, well, we didn't quite realise this bit would go wrong like that.  Instead of the focus being on how to improve it'll be on how things were divided up.
- it's impossible to tell whether it will be a roaring success or a complete disaster.  If it goes ahead then I hope it will be a success because if it is a disaster I'll see it first hand when I go up to see my parents.

The primary reason given for this is that Scotland is not properly represented by this government.  We've had this government for how many terms?  Not long.  So we're proposing destroying a historic, three hundred year old union, because David Cameron and his ilk have been in parliament for a while?

&gt; Now this is going probably going to be downvoted into the depths of hell but whatever.

&gt; To me, this isn't really a story about the benefits system. It's about a man who totally gave up on life. The article states he stopped taking his insulin (remember all you non-UK folks that insulin is completely free on the NHS). Even if he did starve to death - £3.44 is enough to keep you alive for days, perhaps even weeks if you push it to the extreme. Despite this, even if he was starving to death, there is help you can get. Even despite all that, he had family he could have reached out to, surely they wouldn't have just let him starve.

&gt; It wasn't the government that killed him - it was himself.

&gt; Now I'm not saying the benefits system is fantastic and there's nothing wrong but the rules are clear and simple - you don't attend your appointments, you lose your allowance. The article also implies he missed one single appointment - that's total bullshit. These people want to help you - not throw you off the benefit at the first opportunity they get. He was thrown off the benefits once before, these people were trying to help him!

&gt; This is a story about a man who commited suicide. The situation he was in was probably (making some big assumptions here) a direct consequence of depression.

&gt; So let's stop shaking our fists at the 'evil tory bastards' and look at this story for what it is: a tragic story about a man who gave up on life.

&gt; My heart goes out to his family and friends.

true,Girlwithnousername,null,null,"You have to have had credit in order to build up a credit rating. Others have said talk to a mortgage adviser which I thoroughly agree with. In the meantime I suggest you a) apply for a very small overdraft on your current account, even though you do not need it and b) apply for a credit card with a small limit, i.e. £500. Start using that credit card for day to day use and pay it off in full each month. That will get you on the right road to having *some* sort of a credit rating rather than none whatsoever. 

It's absurd that careful people get penalised but that's just the way it is.

You can pay a very small amount of money to get your credit report, I would suggest Experien because they rate you on a red, amber and green scale and even tell you what sort of a risk you are on a scale from 0 to 900 (900 being the least amount of risk). You can also see if there is anything untoward on there, such as identity fraud which you were not previously aware of - people taking out loans in your name and not repaying them. 

If your landlord has been foolish enough not to give you notice in writing, keep quiet, because if he doesn't do it formally, he has to go through a long winded court process to evict you - it's far from ideal, but if needs must, then they must. A £300 a month rise is absolutely outrageous by the way, and I'm sure you could take him to a rent tribunal and win in court. I'm also not sure it's legal that he changes the payment terms and insists on three months in advance. He sounds like a right piece of work; he knew you want to buy a home and took full advantage of you.

You are right that if you only want to be a CAD draughtsperson there are much better opportunities available. But someone who want's to be a more general designer would want this kind of experience, and there is demand for it, even if it is unpaid.

true,mmmmmh,null,null,"I don't think people are averse to paying for quality TV. We're all fully aware the the royal charter which mandates an independent and unbiased broadcasting corporation is a triumph of the civilized world, and needs money from somewhere.

The issue is how it is charged and enforced.

First off, we have lots of TV channels, this include the BBC, but also lots of other private channels. If you want to receive these private channels on a live stream (be it through the internet or through a television) you need a TV licence. But very little (possible none) of the money for the TV licence goes to these other companies. The good and bad side of this is that BBC doesn't have any advertising (in fact, it's legally not allowed to) but all other channels typically sustain themselves through lots of advertising (still nothing on America though in my understanding). So to summarise that point, what should effectively be a ""charge for the BBC service"" is practically a ""charge to own a television, even if you don't use any BBC channels."" (although I think BBC also maintain the broadcasting infrastructure).

Secondly, it's a fixed flat rate charge. If I want to watch just one channel for 1 hour a day, then I must pay the same as someone who spend 10 hours a day watching all channels.

Thirdly, despite the purpose of the TV Licence being to keep the BBC alive, BBC also produce and maintain a lot of other content (such as radio stations, the BBC website etc) which are all free to consume. The licence fee only applies to live broadcasts, so whilst I may have to pay £147 a year to watch a particular documentary on my television, I could just wait ~6 hours and watch it on iPlayer on their website for free.

Fourthly (and this is the biggest bone for a lot of people) is the way the licence is enforced. Basically, they rely on intimidation and ignorance. When you move into a house, they'll send you letters saying how you *need* a TV licence or you face court. The letters get more an more aggressive with blatantly incorrect statement such as threats of imminent court action. If you commit the heinous crime of not having a television, you have to report to the BBC that you *don't* own a television?!  They will then send an inspector round (who has absolutely no authority) who will try and enter your home because if you claim you don't have a television, then you can't be trusted.

The TV people go around insisting they're an authority and have the right to enter your home. But they don't. Practically, they have the same power as a door to door salesman for mops: they can knock on your door and ask if you want a TV licence, but that's it. Imagine if a door to door mop salesman insisted that you *must* call him to tell him you don't have a mop. Imagine if, by default, the mop salesman sent you threatening and intimidating messages saying ""YOU COULD FACE COURT ACTION FOR NOT PAYING FOR YOUR MOP"" even though you've already told them you have no mop. Imagine if then, the mop salesman tried on numerous occasions to use force, threats, lies and intimidation to make his way into your house to confirm you don't actually have a mop (see [videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=tv+licence)). Imagine if the mop company then set a massive propaganda campaign saying they have special mop detection vans to try and scare people into paying (such vans existed, but whether or not they did anything at all [is debatable (sorry for DM source)](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2445153/Are-TV-detector-vans-just-cunning-trick-For-decades-claimed-trap-licence-cheats-In-fact-theyve-led-single-prosecution.html)) Imagine then if 10% of all magistrates court cases were dealing with mop licence evasion, with the majority of defendants being poor and/or uneducated. Imagine if the Mop licencing authority have been [using terrorism laws to justify surveillence](http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/feb/28/surveillance-government-public). Imagine if the Mop Licencing Authority had been misleadingly calling themselves and authority despite actually having no legal authority. That's just the tip of the iceberg, see http://www.lime-marmalade.net/ for more examples of why they attract so much disliking.

This isn't BBC doing all this nasty enforcement though, they outsource it to Capita, so they can say it's not their fault.

Would you want to pay to fund that sort of behaviour or business model? 

So we're not against paying, but the TV licence model is a terrible way of getting people to pay for what is otherwise a world renowned and leading service.

Supposedly this will help produce top class home grown players.

A vote was taken on this system and about 2/3rds agreed to it, although some football league clubs claimed they were effectively blackmailed into it because the Premier League threatened to remove all youth development funding to the football league if they didn't agree to it. It basically allows top clubs to have the pick of youth players for a set fee, and the only way for a club to combat this seems to be to try and improve their academy until they can reach the top level, but on the way the good players they produce will likely be poached by prem clubs.

This was all driven by Sky repeatedly beating them to the stories on the day of the London bombings in 2005. So they decided to run the whole thing like it's in a perpetual state of emergency.

What this fails to take into account is that Sky were faster because they had less journalistic integrity. They would put a story out first and check the facts later, correcting or retracting where necessary. BBC policy was to get confirmation from a second source first.

true,binaryv01d,null,null,"It could potentially affect us in the future, but I think we're at less risk. 

The UK has a fairly competitive broadband market, which means any ISP that starts throttling traffic for commercial reasons runs a severe risk of losing customers. The broadband market over the pond mostly consists of local monopolies or duopolies - often it's a single cable/fibre provider vs a crappy local ADSL provider (the big US ISPs  claim that this amounts to competition). 

Furthermore, many of the US ISPs also own large media corporations. For example, Comcast own NBC, Universal and Vivendi; Time Warner own Warner Bros, CNN and HBO. This means that each mega-ISP had a significant vested interest in promoting particular web-based services and fucking over others. This is very bad for competition  - Comcast could degrade the quality of CNN's web services, for example. It is also very bad for new entrants into any market which the ISPs have an interest in, as they will likely be throttled unless they pony up a significant amount of money. Want to start the next YouTube? Comcast might decide that Hulu (which it owns) should compete against you, and they'll deliberately slow down access to your service.

I think there's less risk here in the UK too - while Sky, Virgin and BT do have their own services to promote, they're on a rather smaller scale.

On the political side of things, I think we're safe-ish here too. I have a decent amount of trust that the major political parties would favour net neutrality, needed it to be enshrined in law. Telecoms lobbyists don't seem to be quite as potent over here, and our regulator (Ofcom) isn't in the middle of a battle over sovereignty between the states and the government. We also don't have the whole bullshit 'FREEDOM\*' cultural attitude to contend with.

That said, I think the UK government should clearly enshrine net neutrality in legislation. Our telecoms market is getting worse (T-Mobile+Orange merger, Sky+O2/Be merger)  and it won't be long before they start looking for new ways to fuck us over.

I'm not ignoring that point. I just referenced it. I know the BBC would probably die without change in a free market. You keep ignoring the point that maybe if the majority don't want to pay for it, it would be a good thing to dispose of.

You can't have it both ways: Either ""it benefits everyone"" and everybody is happy to pay it, or it doesn't and it dies a death. Saying something so trivial (and redundant since we can get news and good tv elsewhere) should be protected because in a free market it would fail is absurd.

&gt;like Spain or Italy and see how the free market works there?

Who also have less disposable income than us, also work less hours than us, and generally healthier than us (possibly because they don't have the culture of staying in to watch TV because 'well, I am paying for it').

I'm not saying you won't find a place for that price, but realistically, you'll probably be either more than 15 minutes from the city centre, or in a flat the size of a large phonebox.

The No campaign surely can't. All they can say is ""if you vote No, things will stay the same, if you vote Yes, things will be worse""

the issue of currency is the only one on which the UK government has even laid out a starting negotiation position. Whitehall officials have been told to not even start communicating with their Hollyrood equivalents to at least start creating a list of issues that would need discussion. David Cameron the only person who could request that the EU provide a legal ruling on iScotland's membership has refused to do so.

&gt; EU membership would leave the Scots less free and in control over their affairs than the current set-up. 

We will be able to control and manage our own military.
We will be able to control our taxation within constraints.
We will be able to negotiate on our own behalf with the EU/WT/NATO/UN etc
We will be able to control our own benefits system
We will be able to leave or stay in the Eu if we so chose to do so.

So there are plenty of areas where iScotland will have a far greater say that it currently does.

Sure you can learn more about a side with a bigger sample of games but I'd argue that Spurs squad remains similar and the manager is yet to settle quite yet, thus last season can't be discounted when searching for context and meaning with this result. Even still, you can still learn a lot from singular games, indeed LFC's result vs. City hinted towards a difference in class between the sides. There is clearly a gulf between Liverpool and Spurs *at the moment* and only time will tell if that gap will grow wider or narrower. I think it's pretty shortsighted to write off every loss as a singular poor performance rather than assessing the bigger picture. You are correct in a sense though saying you can't assess the quality of the side from just this game but since the game is not played on paper this is irrelevant. Quality is performance since this is a team game, and if/when you're team clicks then I'll view you as a quality side based on performance. 

For the record I think you've got a finally got a manager to get behind and can see you having a similar season to Rodger's first at Liverpool, coming good in the second half of the season (perhaps not as lacklustre in the first half though).

Well again you've jumped to a bad conclusion with dreadful math.

Only by 3% - even at 10% (the expected number) it's not even two times. Again you simply take one aspect of a statistic and slant it.

true,rockstarsheep,eng-Oxfordshire,London,"Dutch Cuisine. Well, to my mind that can be split in to two major categories. Firstly there is Dutch Home Cuisine and secondly there is Dutch Restaurant Cuisine. 

Dutch Home Cuisine. This is probably not very well known to tourists. Here you're looking at potato as the main form of starch, which is either served boiled, mashed or fried. However, when it comes to mashed there are variations. There's mash with leeks, or carrots, or pickled cabbage or endive. This is served with or without a jus / gravy and is accompanied by a piece of meat. That could be chicken pieces, pork chops, or beef steaks, or smoked sausage. Maybe even fish sometimes, however I've not seen that very often. The seasoning is minimal and some might say even quite minimalist. You'd also find ""kip satay"" / ""chicken satay"" on a home menu from time to time too. I'm not sure what then English translation of ""drasdjesvlees"" is, however it's a traditional meal of slow cooked beef with a mixture of herbs that you get from a C1000 or AH. Of course you'll find spagbol on the menu and it appeared to me when I lived there that everyone pretty much has the same recipe. 

That would be food for dinner. Lunch time - broodjes. Sandwiches are a staple. White bread, ham and cheese. There are a lot of cold meats, pates and spreads for bread. For those who like filet americain - there's that too - with or without onions. 

Dutch Restaurant Cuisine. Well, restaurants with a more Dutch twist normally have 3-4 starters, 5-6 mains and then 2-3 desserts on offer. Starters can vary, however beef carpaccio is a favourite. Steaks, chicken satay and grilled fish seem to hog the mains, often served with fries / frietjes. You'll find some pancake restaurants that will serve savoury pancakes as mains too. If you find yourself at a ""toko,"" you'll be having Indonesian food - bami or nasi - and there are quite a few of these hanging about. Most of the food is not super spicy, but very tasty. There are also some restaurants that only serve beef steaks, such as Loetje in Amsterdam. Italian and Spanish food is also quite popular, so that's pizza and pasta, as well as tapas. 

Apple pie and cream or ice cream. What would NL be without Dutch Apple Pie? :) 

I could go on and on. I'd say that food is different in the north of NL as opposed to the South. I've not included anything about Febo or other take aways. NL actually is pretty diverse when it comes to their food. They just don't really talk about if. :)",0,1410274113,null,0,false,0,ckdg3e9,t3_2fwbhy,t1_ckdg3e9,t3_2fwbhy,null,1427109484,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

&gt;You don't ""shop them around immediately"" when he's the most important player at your club and you have your whole team built around him.

&gt;&gt;If he has expressed his desire to leave yes you do. It's called smart business. You push the player to make a decision. You throw other teams in the equation.  You say you can leave but these are the teams we accepted bids from.  Then you don't accept the cheap bids like Barcelona's.  You give the player the option to go and still protect your club.  

&gt;&gt; I think Cesc had success at Barca. 

&gt;He left Arsenal to become a legend at Barca. He wanted to be loved by fans of both clubs. He failed. At the end of the day no one at Barca even gave a shit about him, and Arsenal fans now feel fooled and betrayed.
&gt;&gt;Thats weird most Barcelona fans I know actually wanted him to stay. And so did the players.

&gt;Because it's painfully out of touch with reality. Chelsea is fuelled by oil money. Not every club can afford to replace their old toys with shiny new ones whenever they feel like it. The money Arsenal made from player sales during the barren years went directly into the stadium. There was no way we could've replaced Cesc with the amount we got, and Barcelona seriously bullied us to even lower the price, all at his consent.

&gt;&gt; Do you have any evidence to your claim that Barcelona's tactics were consented by Cesc? Arsenal does have the money to make purchases. They choose not too.  They choose to not spend the money they earn on players and this is why all the top players want to leave after a few seasons.   And Arsenal held a contract with Cesc. The price you let him go for is poor management. You can claim they bullied Arsenal but in the end they allowed him to leave and agreed at that price.  That is Arsenals fault. They could have held out and said no and named a better price. The team who has the contract with the player is in control. Unless you suck at management. 

Also, Arsenal is worth more than Chelsea. They make more money than Chelsea. They can easily add to their squad. They have the income.  They are the 5th wealthiest club in the world.

My main concern is how money would stretch between taxes (the source of generating money for a universal income) and actually providing that to everyone in the country. I haven't run the numbers on this - so I'm not saying it's impossible, more: how do we make it work? 

Furthermore - who is eligible? Topically do we apply it only to British nationals? I can't say I'm too fond of the idea of allowing *any* European national to start claiming it on arrival here in the UK as that would undoubtedly start a mass immigrant to take advantage - so we'd have to start picking the dividing line between how and when you're eligible. 

&gt; My main point is that the benefits system is at this point practically purpose built to add needless mental stress to people's lives - when they need it least.

The trouble here is that for every story I read about some poor disabled person who died - and it is a tragedy - I could pick a solid hand ful of people wandering out of my local JS office and straight to the local Weather-spoons. I hate to say it but some people really are lazy and some people really do want a free ride - as much as they're not a majority - they do exist. It's hard to muster sympathy for people in *that* position. 

That's the crux of the issue I feel - we need a system that will fairly give everyone the chance - but there will always be those who want to take advantage and enjoy an easy life. Why not? The easy life can look damn attractive - but we need to tread the fine line between being a progressive nation and a nation that promotes living on charity.

And yet we go around and around.

You can't say the BBC should be protected because nobody will pay for it otherwise, then say most people think it's good value for money. You are contradicting yourself. You are actually arguing with yourself, do you realise this?

&gt;You're only argument amounts to saying that the free market always results in the best of all possible worlds.

I didn't say always, but it would prove (one of your conflicting) statements about the BBC true. And if the BBC fails? So what? What if that is the best of both worlds?

I am recording my calls now because the initial one which kicked all this off would have been really useful but it was out of the blue so I didn't think it would happen. I know they probably wouldn't be of any use legally unless I told him I was doing it though so I have to find out about that too.

I imagine this is all because he wants to charge more rent than he's charging me, but it's a dick move to go about it this way.

Granted, Salmond has a very easy job. Just ignore all problems, pump up some nationalism and keep letting the Westminster boys fuck up. Keep the pressure on, build some more nationalism and hope the momentum spills over. Anything the government call him out on, he can just label as ""the establishment"" and he can write their facts and figures off as some bullshit by Westminster toff banker arseholes. And nothing really stops him from making wild promises for the future either.

But holy shit the government has mishandled this referendum and have not death with Salmond well at all. They ignored it for a long time, hoping it would go away. Then they started criticising, saying how Scotland wouldn't be able to cope and how they are a net benefactor from the UK relationship. But that's retarded, even if it is true (which I genuinely don't know). That tactic is usually the best way to piss off proud people and make them want to prove you wrong. What Scottish person is going to say to themselves ""yeah, we'd better stay because our country sucks and we need to keep sucking London's tits?"" None. So basically, that strategy just feeds right into Salmond's hands too by further increasing nationalist feelings and Scottish pride. Then Westminster tried threatening and playing hard ball, which didn't really work either. And now they're begging and making last minute symbolic gestures. They don't seem to realise how unpopular they are. Does Cameron think going to Scotland right now actually helps the fight for a no vote? Is he fucking mental? Showing his face there at the last possible moment is a huge sign of desperation. In summary, a shocking amount of incompetence overall from everybody in London.

Personally I hope Scotland doesn't go, but I don't really have any stake in the final result.

For the most part no. I think its fair to say that a lot of people will be disappointed either way, but you'd be looking at widespread mild disappointment rather than civil unrest. Its also wise to note that most people are neither die hard unionists or die hard nationalists, so Scotland being very divided seems less likely - many no voters aren't ideologically opposed to the concept of Scotland being independent, they just don't think its the preferable option.

Most of them are broke and out of business now anyway but the chains that bought them out saw where the gastropub trend was going and carried it on.  What started with Weatherspoons selling 'gourmet burgers' for few quid has developed into people having higher standards for a lot of thier every day food in general.

20 years ago pub food was mostly chicken in a basket, or a microwaved tiny burger in a bun with some Mccain oven chips.  Now pubs sell quality meals and supermarkets have had to catch up with consumer demand for higher quality produce.  This combined with the fall in prices of mass-produced processed food has meant that what started as 'finest' and 'taste the difference' is becoming more normal in most households where people earn a reasonable income.

The latest edition of the Prison Population Statistics puts the Christian prison population at 50.2%. 

&gt;Only by 3%

Is 3% significant or not? You say it is for Christians, (although you are wrong about the figure) but it is not for Muslims? Make up your mind. 

even at 10% (the expected number) it's not even two times. 

At 10% it would be just over two times (4.8% general population. And that is exactly the reason that it is significant. Muslims in this country have over twice the representation they should have in prisons. 

&gt;Again you simply take one aspect of a statistic and slant it. Roman Catholics are around the 5 million mark (3-4%) in the UK - they represent 17% of the prison population that's a MASSIVE over representation of the numbers by nearly 5 times.

Where do you get your information on the number of Catholics in the UK? Because that data is not recorded in the Census. The reason I have not broken down the information into particular Christian denominations, or Muslim denominations for that matter, is that there is no reliable information available for those numbers. You are pretending there is to make a point, but your point is based off of unreliable information. 

&gt;If you're not prepared to treat all religions the same then accept you have a biased view.

I judge all religions equally, but that doesn't mean they should all be treated the same, they are not the same. I don't actually believe that there is a problem with religion at all. It is cultural influences and cultural isolation that causes the problems, unfortunately religion is very important in most of these isolated communities, and plays a part in the problem, and the major religion in these communities tends to be Islam.

true,NapoleonHeckYes,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"I have to stand up for the BBC here. 

Firstly, criminalising the (often poor) people who cannot, do not want to or simply do not pay the license fee is wrong. This must change. 

Still, people are using it as a way to take potshots at the BBC. Trust me, you would miss it if their funding were removed. 

Living in Germany, I see how bad public media can be. The TV licence here is not a TV licence at all - EVERY household must pay just over €200 a year, regardless of whether they own any equipment to receive any kind of broadcast. They used to have to pay if they owned a TV, radio or even internet. And they don't call it a tax. 

The quality is dismal because they have a federal system whereby 19 entirely separate regional broadcasters (i.e. 19 BBCs) each broadcast their own TV and radio stations. This means you end up with 19 separate Radio 1-style stations, each with their own studio costs, presenters etc. but with much the same content as each other. An utter waste. Because of this, there is precious little funding for new and innovative content. In fact, they often choose not to create new programmes for fear of 'gambling with the public's money', but in the end it is wasted on programmes which are dull, lifeless and have failed to change with the times. 

In the United States, radio networks such as NPR and TV such as PBS are partly funded by tax money and partly by donations. In return for donations, sponsors receive a mention during a programme (""This programme is brought to you by...""). There are some great programmes on their networks, but large scale projects, except for co-produced products, are mostly out of the question. 

Many radio programmes are syndicated, so shows like This American Life will be made by one partner station and will be broadcasted across the network. This works well but quality is inconsistent and much of the radio and TV programmes can be as dull as the worst of Radio 4 and BBC 4. 

We have, thanks to the unique way the BBC is funded (wink wink), a strong broadcaster, which provides a neutral, commercial-free source of entertainment, education and information to the British public. It is a wonderful antidote to a Britain filled with Murdoch press intrusion, Daily Mail bile and poor and patronising local/regional television and radio.

The BBC has given us a strong, unified media culture - just think of the amount of times people reference Monty Python, or talk about who's on Strictly Come Dancing (just because you or I might not like it, doesn't make it bad), or who have enjoyed listening to Steve Wright for years. 

Also - if the BBC were not as strong as it is, the commercial networks would have little incentive to produce high-quality entertainment. Instead, they would simply produce more bottom-feeding, lowest common denominator rubbish. Yes, ITV, Channel 4 and (to an extent) Channel 5 have a public service remit too, but this is far less evident than with the BBC's output.

For me, pulling the plug on the BBC would be akin to getting rid of the NHS. Not that the BBC saves lives, but in the fact it is a national institution which is trusted to provide a high quality service, which we all pay into and have the opportunity to use if we choose to do so.

The Corporation is under enormous pressure. The Conservatives have demanded the BBC now pick up the tab for both the World Service (previously funded by the Foreign Office) and S4C. There has also been talk of 'top-slicing' the licence fee to provide funds to the other public broadcasters, but I think this will simply water down the quality of content on offer. 

The people who enforce the TV licence need to approach people in a different way, and those who are poorest should certainly not be hounded. 

But we need to appreciate how important the BBC is to Britain. It is unique in the world, and we would miss it if it went. ",0,1410276860,null,0,false,0,ckdhghy,t3_2fw1x8,t1_ckdhghy,t3_2fw1x8,null,1427108758,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

If you look a the talents we have in our academy it really is frightening with the likes of Ibe, Sinclair, Rossiter, Wilson, Canos, Yesil and the list really does just go on and on. 

I understand there is a ruling where you need 4 (I think) players registered that have trained at the club for 3 years between their 15th and 21st birthday but there NEEDS to be more rules on the matter in my opinion and I'm sure a lot of people share it. At Liverpool we are lucky that we have a manager and owners who do adovacate the use anf development of younger players but Chelsea and City are just appaling at it.

Chelsea have some really brilliant young talents in their squad which simply will not get game time due to their big spending.

These are the stat changes from the Winter update. So our defence went down besides Migs and Flanni Alves, Gerrard dropped despite being one of our top goal scorers, probably because of his speed stat and that the goals came from penalties. Lucas went down probably due to injury and loss of form. Allen stayed the same because fuck him, that's why /s.

Sterling, Hendo and Sturridge went up by a few, which is nice. Coutinho enjoyed a +1, hopefully in long shots after that City goal.

New recruits Lallana and Lambert stayed the same despite being Southampton's two most important players and Markovic took a big step up to a comfortable 78.

EDIT: Added more players from /r/FIFA. Borini takes a stat drop from playing more, out of position and mostly scoring penalties :/ . The Southampton boys are getting no love off EA and neither are Kolo or Enrique.

So, there you go. Finish 2nd and not much to show for it.

true,dpash,cnty-expat,Expat (Belize),"It's impossible to delay the 2015 elections any later than 5 July 2015 without an Act of Parliament. .

What's likely to happen is that Scotland will continue to send MPs to Westminster until Scotland declares independence, at which point they'll go home.

This may result in the government no longer having a majority, in which case the government will attempt to continue governing as a minority government or attempt to form a coalition to continue in power. 

If they go with a minority government, the opposition could force a vote of no confidence, and attempt to form an alternative government. It really depends on who can form a government with the confidence of the House of Commons.

Should no one manage to form a stable government, they'll consider calling an early election. 

So that's the mechanics, but the main practical outcome from Scotland's ~60 MPs leaving Westminster is that it gets much harder for Labour to form a government, as the majority of Scottish MPs were left-leaning. The Tories only have 1 MP in Scotland. Basically Labour will lose somewhere between 10-20% of their MPs and the Tories lose none.

true,pacdude,null,null,"Three new contestants compete on each episode. Each contestant first plays individually against the Chaser, starting with a round where they try to answer as many questions correctly as possible during a one minute rapid-fire round, with each correct answer adding $5,000 to their bank. After the minute is up, the contestant competes against the Chaser in order to retain their bank and continue to the Final Chase.

In the Chase, the contestant's goal is to answer enough questions correctly to move the earned winnings into the team bank without being caught by the Chaser, whose job is to catch them by capitalizing on mistakes made by the player. The contestant must answer five questions correctly without being caught to bank the money and continue to the Final Chase. However, the Chaser offers the contestant two additional amounts at his own discretion prior to the start of the round. The contestant can choose to play for a lower amount and start one step closer to the bank, while being required to answer only four questions correctly without being caught. The contestant can also play for a higher amount of money, but must instead answer six questions correctly without being caught. If the contestant takes the higher offer, the Chaser may escalate the stakes by offering a ""super offer"" for an even higher amount, with the contestant being required to answer seven questions correctly without being caught.

After making their choice, their prize money is displayed on a seven-space gameboard, with the appropriate number of spaces away from the bank depending upon the contestant's decision with the Chaser off of the gameboard eight spaces away from the bank. Both the contestant and Chaser are then presented with the same multiple choice question, and each locks-in their answer separately. After one has selected their answer, the other has five seconds to answer after them, otherwise they are locked out and given credit for an incorrect answer. For each question the contestant answers correctly, the prize money earned moves one step closer to the team bank. For each question answered correctly by the Chaser, he moves one step closer to the prize money. Additional questions are asked until the contestant either banks their prize money or the Chaser catches the contestant eliminating them from the game. No movement is made by the contestant and/or the Chaser if an incorrect answer is provided or if they are locked out. All three contestants take part in separate rounds to determine which of them will advance to the Final Chase and how much prize money will be at stake. If all three contestants fail to win their individual chases, the team selects one contestant to play the Final Chase alone for a total of $15,000 ($5,000 per contestant).

The Final Chase is played on a gameboard, with the team receiving a head start of one space for each member who advanced to this round. During the commercial break, the team chooses between two sets of questions, labeled ""A"" and ""B"", with the Chaser playing the other set of questions. These contestants have two minutes to answer as many questions as possible. After a question is asked, contestants are only permitted to respond or pass a question after first ringing-in. If there is only one contestant in the Final Chase, then he or she does not use the buzzer. Each question answered correctly within the time limit moves the team one space ahead on the board.

After time expires, the Chaser is then given two minutes to catch the team by correctly answering a new series of questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the Chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question. A correct answer pushes the Chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he is at the starting line. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the Chaser continues to answer questions. If the Chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally. If there is one contestant for the Final Chase, that player wins the all of the money. However, if the Chaser catches the team before time expires, the team leaves with no money.

&gt; run the numbers 

News Statesman ran a story on the numbers run by the Citizen's Income Trust a few weeks ago. [Link here](http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2014/08/citizens-income-71-week-person-would-make-britain-fairer).

Proposed there is a half-measure which replaces state pensions, jsa, sundry other things with a universal income for a (relatively) very small increase in spend.

It would be great if the figure was a little higher than the ~£3k summed up there - but that calculation doesn't deal with the monstrous issue of housing benefits (tied to prices), which frankly *is* a nightmare.

Suggested increased taxes and crackdown on dodging could help boost this figure - considering tax avoidance and evasion costs about nine billion pounds a year.


Eligibility - Insanely tricky. This is probably the biggest hurdle to any basic income system. You'd have to adopt a very strict immigration policy, while trying, somehow, to keep it fair. I agree that this would be a total nightmare as well.

&gt; I could pick a solid hand ful of people wandering out of my local JS office and straight to the local Weather-spoons

I completely don't disagree (otherwise known as 'I agree'). I know of someone from my old school, currently on benefits, who went on a trip to *Disneyworld, Florida* this summer. It is infuriating to see someone getting given money, however little, for free, while you scrimp and save and work hard for what you have. The system *is* abused. Some people *are* taking the piss. I even disagree with the claims made by some on the left making a point of fraud statistics, because those stats are always going to miss *fraudulent claims that got away with it*. Sadly, it seems that those gaming the system worst, know it best, and have a good old laugh, while those who try hard are the ones that get screwed most.

I suggest you register a formal complaint with your bank at their inability to update your details with the CRA. 

You should then register a dispute with Equifax, and they should place a ""notice of correction"" on your report, allowing you to put your reasons for this issue as an attachment.

The downside to this is that every credit application of significance that you make will be referred for a person to read the notice of correction.

If your bank fails again refer the complaint to the ombudsman. Keep applying the pressure, keep records of all your correspondence, and make it clear that you're serious.

This causes discomfort amongst Jimbo, Ned, and a number of the other flag supporters: they don't wish to be sided on any issue with the Klan. To remedy this issue, Jimbo and Ned infiltrate in the clan and suggest that if they want the flag to remain unchanged they should advocate that the flag should be changed, because the majority of the people will always vote against what the Klan wants.

The crown estates today are worth roughly £8 billion but the cost of the civil service wages alone would be more than the entire estates are worth.

Yes, and they aren't expected to any more because they couldn't possibly afford it.

Every monarch since King George has signed a different agreement on being crowned, all of which have surrendered the revenue of the Crown Estate.

The reason the Queen isn't paying the Civil servants wages is because she could and would never have agreed to.

You're missing the big picture here, which is that the Crown Estates only exist in this weird state of possession because of the complicated relationship between Monarchy and Parliament. 

If you forcibly strip the monarchy of their political status, I see no reason for them to let Parliament off easily about the Crown Estate. Chances are they would win in court too.

So the money from the Crown Estate goes into parliament because the Monarch has agreed upon it.

true,AidanSmeaton,cnty-scotland,Glasgow,"It's a complex issue so might be worth looking into all the issues in a bit more detail.

The UK is politically diverse and its population is not spread evenly. There are 3 times as many people living in London and the South East as there are in Scotland, which means they have better representation in Westminster and their issues are prioritised over ours. This is understandable, and it would be acceptable if we faced similar political issues, but we don't. Scotland suffers under policies which are not suited to us, as we're consistently outnumbered and powerless to make a difference.

On top of this, Westminster uses first-past-the-post voting which results in a two party system (Conservative and Labour) which many in Scotland are unhappy with. Holyrood (the devolved Scottish parliament established in 1999) uses a more proportional system, giving fairer representation to minority parties such as the Lib Dems, the Greens, and (ironically) the Conservatives. If it was designed like Westminster, only a vote for the SNP or Labour would matter. Thankfully, Holyrood is more democratic and represents the diverse wishes of Scottish people better. It also has no unelected House of Lords, no affiliation with the Church of England, uses a more modern democratic process, and is more transparent. This makes it a fairer and less corrupt government.

Although it's relativity young, Holyrood has had a massive positive impact on Scotland. It controls devolved policies such as: education, the NHS, housing, social services, law and order, sport and the arts, tourism, agriculture, forestry, and the environment. Most of us would agree that it handles these affairs much better than Westminster, and we would like to see it take control of other policies such as: employment, immigration, benefits, defence, trade &amp; industry, full tax raising and spending powers, renewable energy, oil &amp; gas, data protection and the Constitution.

There are plenty of us doing okay in Scotland and the UK, but many in our society are being let down by our government and it's not going to change any time soon. This is a real opportunity for us to make a difference. This is about making a political decision to be a sovereign nation that is fairer and prioritises the needs of the people that live and work here. Most importantly, it's not personal, it's political. Scotland is as viable a country as all its northern European neighbours, and many of us are waking up to the fact that we can be a better country independent from Westminster.

Which is why the government took the estates deal in the first place. The monarchy can't have their cake and eat it. They have to either pay for the civil government costs or take a government stipend. It's not largess on the part of the crown that they allow the estates to be run for the benefit of the country it a practical measure as they simply cannot afford to pay their bills otherwise. The first monarch to refuse to sign over the estate would be presented with a bill and be forced into bankruptcy.

&gt; If you forcibly strip the monarchy of their political status, I see no reason for them to let Parliament off easily about the Crown Estate. 

No more monarchy equals no more crown estates. The estates are lands owned by the monarch through conquest. The Government has twice (civil war/glorious revolution) taken the lands from the crown before returning them back to the person deemed by the government of the day to be the true king.

From 2015 on, as more and more coal plants shut down to comply with emissions regulations, we introduce more wind capacity into the grid and we start shutting down nukes by end decade, it's going to get more and more difficult to balance supply.

2016 will be the year when things get really interesting, as the Industrial Emissions Directive kicks in.  All plants which are non-compliant with this directive (read, most remaining british coal plants) are allowed to run for a maximum of 17,500 hours between 2016-2023.  Given the high cost of plant upgrades to meet the IED, it seems highly likely that most coal operators will just burn through those hours as quickly as possible and scrap the plants.  Similar things will likely happen with some older gas plants.

Given that labour seem intent on scaring any energy investment out of the country with their insane price fixing idea, we're unlikely to see any of the big players committing to building any new plants until after the election.

I resent being legally obliged to pay for children's channels and general entertainment channels, for games shows and soaps and inane breakfast and evening magazine shows when I don't watch them. I don't mind paying for the documentary's, news channels and other things I do watch. Note that this feeling applies to all package television services. I dislike having to pay for E4 or ITV in order to get the discovery, national geographic or history channels, so this comment isn't exclusive to the BBC.

However with the BBC it becomes even worse, I am obliged to pay the TV licence in order to watch NON-BBC programming live on my television. It would be perfectly reasonable to factor in the television licence into my virgin or sky subscription only if I used a package that included BBC channels.

Taken a step further, given the ""unique way the BBC is funded"" I should be able to create an account on the BBC website that automatically bills me for live shows watched. If the licence adds up to only 39 pence or so (as others have stated) for many channels broadcasting 24 hours a day (or close to), the cost to watch a single episode of say Dr Who for a fraction of a pence.

It's a bloody contract, which changes depending on the context.

&gt;No more monarchy equals no more crown estates. The estates are lands owned by the monarch through conquest. The Government has twice (civil war/glorious revolution) taken the lands from the crown before returning them back to the person deemed by the government of the day to be the true king. Surely that's legal precedence that while the monarch might ""own"" the estates, they do so at the pleasure of the government of the day.

Saying that partitioning the country and spiting people down an arbatory line on the map will bring us together is idiotic.

&gt;'Yes' vote is good for England because we will be forced to reassess our own stagnant political institutions.

No a yes vote is good for England because Scotland is a financial time bomb waiting to happen.

Currently while there is higher public spending in Scotland it is offset by the tax generated by oil. But unlike Norway whos production is yet to peek the north sea peek was 15 years ago. Add to that the looming Scottish demographic crisis , a generation of pensioners without sufficient workers to generate the tax to pay them, and  in 20 years we might look back at Scottish independence as a blessing in disguise for the rUK.

Additionally the UK government sends a great deal of research money and investment to Scotland which could all be redirected to other parts of the UK.

Also the issues with currency would likely encourage big chunks of the Scottish financial sector to shift to London.

As someone from England its very much a heart says No, head says Yes type of thing.

PM me if you want me to recommend ours (I'd rather not just ""do so"" here in a thread and look like I'm advertising!). You sound like perfect mortgage material to me; but a broker (whose interest it is in to find you a mortgage) will work harder than I will to work out why you're having difficulty.

I know what you're saying here and this is the argument the goverment have used as well, my problem with it is this will likely affect adults who still live with their parents or tenants of rented properties where the landlord pays for the internet and having to put up with a filtered connection because the account holder refuses to turn the filter off, some of the filters are also ""pre-ticked"" to agree to have the filtering on so a lot of people will unwittingly leave it on.

The problem is people seem skeptical that changes to local government will actually improve anything rather than just adding an extra tier of fuckwittery to the layers of bureaucracy and taxation we already enjoy.

I believe Bristol only narrowly succeeded because for years it's council was paralyzed with no majority and parties that squabbled. Given that situation, electing a Mayor appeared less like increasing the complexity of local government, and more like a way of simplifying it by making the tripartisan council less important.

I did spend some time researching the matter of TV detection vans and while I wasn't able to come up with anything conclusive, I was able to find quite a lot of resources that would prove that technically it is/was possible, but only on the CRT and/or analogue TVs (which by the way would explain why the vans are no longer a thing).

The two methods that made the most sense to me:

1. Measuring radiation would allow you to detect cathode rays reaching the measuring equipment through walls and other objects. It would allow you to determine where the rays are coming from as well, although it wouldn't be possible to measure the distance accurately.

2. Tuning into the TV oscillator frequency.

I found this - http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3345/does-the-bbc-have-tv-detector-vans-and-how-can-they-tell-if-you-arent-paying-a while I was looking for the right terminology for the second point, so I'll link that instead. 

The answer talks about method 2 but method 1 is also mentioned in the comment under the question.

true,Rodents210,rose,Rose,"&gt; It is quite pointless to share theories when all you want to do is insert your opinions and flat-out refuse others'. You clearly do this on every thread you comment on (checked your history-- you sound resentful. Shouldn't have)

Hardly. I dismiss theories with no basis or uninformed opinions. For example, most of what you saw in my comment history was probably me over in /r/thesims being very jaded over people who have admitted to not playing the new installment constantly entering every thread and dumping on it, claiming things that are demonstrably untrue to anyone who've played the game. As someone who has seen this process happen two prior times with the middle two installments of the franchise, have predicted every fan reaction thus far accurately, and know exactly what's going to happen going forward, it's just annoying. It's like watching people act out a script and insist that they're not.

When it comes to fan theories on any sort of storytelling medium, I dismiss them if and only if you're twisting something to your own means with no regard for what else was happening in the scene. That, people outright disregarding canon (e.g. in /r/TheLastAirbender someone claiming that Korra will reconnect with her past incarnations despite that the exact reasons for this being impossible are laid out point-for-point at least three times in the show and it would completely break every internal rule of the show; or in /r/harrypotter someone claiming the snake from ch. ~2 of Sorcerer's Stone is Voldemort's snake Nagini, despite them being different sexes, different species, *and* Rowling has specifically debunked it).

In regards to your theory, if there were *any* basis for River returning then I would be open to it. The show's internal inconsistency leaves me open to many theories on this show, including Missy being the Master or the Rani (although I personally believe she is a new character, as that is what happens 99.99999% of the time anyone in this show has an ""X is Y"" theory, and I legitimately can't think of a single instance where one has been right, so that remaining 0.00001% is just benefit of the doubt).

&gt; I am just explaining why I have a gist that River is alive

A duplicate of her mind is alive. Her body is dead. She is in the mainframe. Whether or not this data echo still exists after Name of the Doctor is ambiguous, but there is no basis for her having somehow obtained a new body.

&gt; Something Moffat would not do? Unless you're claiming that you're Moffat's daughter, a regeneration of him, or maybe even himself (gasp!) maybe you'd realize that most of your assumptions are baseless opinions.

Or maybe, as someone who is able to recognize a writer's style and have been heavily involved in writing for over 15 years, I am able to recognize ""Hmm, this writer for this show literally always does this certain thing, and has never not done that certain thing in the show. Perhaps the fact that this theory depends on him suddenly deciding for no particular reason to *not* do this thing could be evidence that the theory is not true"" (hint: that's perfectly valid reasoning; much like how you can discount any major-event theory from A Song of Ice and Fire if there has been absolutely *no* foreshadowing to it whatsoever, because GRRM simply doesn't write that way. Moffat simply does not simply drop massive plot-twists whose only clues were a single line clearly intended to mean something else, which requires being taken out-of-context for it to even work as a clue).

&gt; (See what I did there? Lol. Sounds stupid now, doesn't it?)

Kinda. But not the part you wanted, I think. The point of theories is that there is some basis behind them. Some evidence. Your evidence is a single line, taken out of its context in order to give it a different meaning. Missy being River because of that line is the same as saying that during the period that Clara was away from the Doctor while he was on Trenzalore, the Doctor was secretly replaced by a Dalek piloting the Teselecta because we've seen the Teselcta able to take the Doctor's form before and because the Dalek in episode 2 of this season told the Doctor he makes a good Dalek, even though that line was *totally* intended to mean something completely different, its intended meaning was obvious, and the core of the theory is at best as solid as an office building made of sugar wafers.",0,1410291380,null,0,1410293566,0,ckdp3c7,t3_2fv9ie,t1_ckdp3c7,t1_ckdny3n,null,1427104736,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

All licenses generate revenue for the licencor- such as the owner of a lake who grants fishing licenses. Software is infinitely reproducible - therefore it's an artificial limit.

There's another crucial difference - I have a choice what software I want to purchase to run on my system, I don't, for example, have to pay for MS Office if I want to use LibreOffice exclusively.

If I want to watch TV through Virgin Media or Sky, and exclusively non-BBC channels then I've still got to buy a license for the BBC.

true,TheresanotherJoswell,eng-northumberland,Northumberland,"But the Banker is making money for himself. The Queen is making money for the country.

And you need to understand something, we give the Queen far less money than the Crown Estate makes.

The Crown Estate lives in this weird little bubble of possession by which Parliament basically buys the right to own it from the Monarch in return for a salary.

The Crown Estate makes about 8 billion pounds yearly, and the Queen get's a small of that in return.

How did this come to be you ask/ Well basically, George the III inherited a very large amount of land, castles, money, golden hats etc. from his father, and he from his father down the line until you get to the point where Kings of England were forcibly taking land off of people 1500 years ago.

Georgie was in debt. He needed to pay it off, but the Crown Estate basically wasn't valuable enough to satisfy his debtors. He set up a deal with Parliament by which the ""ownership"" of the crown estate was given to Parliament in return for a Civil List salary, and to be returned to his Heir on his death.

Every monarch since then has signed the same agreement, and in return get's a salary.

IF INSTEAD!

The Queen had been crowned and had refused to sign said agreement, selling ""ownership"" of the Crown Estate to Parliament in return for a salary and only until her death, here's what would happen.

She would keep the lands of the Crown Estate and be *a lot more wealthy*.

So that's something I want to stress. The Queen, entitled to 8 billion pounds a year, turned it down.

To me, that is not the behaviour of a scrounger.

Now before you get into any post-modern ""what if's"" about whether or not she deserves to have any claim to the Crown Estate; it doesn't matter.

She does have a claim, and that cannot be changed unless by new legislation which explicitly strips the monarchy of their property.

I am not and will not be in favor of taking away a familiy's land, houses, and assets of any kind for no reason but than the democratic will of the UK.

she'll send me a text message, i'll miss it because i'm watching tv or asleep or whatever. A few hours later, i get another text message on my other phone asking why i haven't replied. I ignore it, because i'm annoyed at her for being so needy, she does the same again the next day.

This is how she interacts with family. With strangers, it's worse. She's immediately distrustful, hostile, angry for no reason the moment they do any slight thing she dislikes. She cant call say an energy supplier up and ask them to fix a mistake, she has to shout and yell at them to get her anger out. She sees nothing wrong with this approach.

I had to diversify and join my parents in antiques a while back because, unless you have massive financial backing and a large client base, you're always pushing uphill and the buyers are disappearing. There will always be hardcore collectors but the casual ones are more interested in reading than owning the books, and there are now torrent groups who chip in to buy a book, scan it and upload it. Stupid bloody internet*

Although people who work office hours are going to have to drive home in the dark anyway, it makes sense for them to go to work in daylight, again it will most likely be safer. Not only is it shit getting up in the dark, you probably aren't fully alert.

The real question is whether we should bother changing the clocks in summer. Daylight is plentiful, so it is always going to be daylight when most people start their day. Changing the clocks gives you an extra hour of sunshine in the evening, which is generally good, and also saves energy. Of course, you don't want it to stay light much beyond 9-ish, you do actually need it to go dark so you can get to sleep.

Of course he used it in a book. 90% of the 8th Doctor's adventures were in books and radio broadcasts, and with the exception of very few details revealed in the Night of the Doctor, it has been ambiguous since the show's revival what is cannon and what isn't. 

As far as the Night of the Doctor, I can't really figure out how that 6:49 long prequel directly contradicts anything that happened in Osskah. The Time Wars are happening by the time that short story occurs, but the Doctor has yet to serve on the front lines. It would appear from the short story that the Time Lock hasn't even occurred yet, as the Doctor is running around all of space and time trying to save planets, stars, and civilizations from dying due to the temporal effects of Time Wars. Basically, Osskah takes place before the Night of the Doctor.

I will grant you that the sonic screwdriver that the 8th Doctor uses almost a minute into the Night of Doctor does not resemble 9's. It also doesn't resemble the War Doctor's. In fact, it looks identical to the 7th Doctor's sonic.

We are left with one of three assumptions. (1) The 8th Doctor only ever used 7's sonic, or a close version to it. Meaning that all of the others never happened. (2) The 8th Doctor had a fascination with constructing new sonic screwdrivers, in which case all of the one's noted are possible, as are even more varieties. (3) In the same vein as 2, the 8th Doctor used multiple sonics interchangeably, *but* the blue version that he used was the version marketed from the radio play, in which case, you would be right, he did not use the same one as the 9th Doctor.

However, unless you have proof otherwise, I don't think we can determine which option is the correct one. 

And, yes, I do place a decent amount of trust in the Wiki's. This show has been going on multiple mediums since 1963. The Wiki's know more than either of us, by far.

I guess they figure that there is a net gain overall.

But several things:

1. Rich, middle class couples who may be religious are less likely to have an abortion

2. Same rich middle class couples,  are probably kept sweet by religious types

3. Before they're implanted I suspect they're zygotes or something elses.. not foetuses

4. Religious people are nothing if not hypocritical and a-la-carte about who they complain about.



I've made the assumption here that people who go for IVF are probably middle class. Mainly because everyone I know who has done it has been rich and middle class.  I guess poorer people get to the stage of life where they conceive earlier and dont need as much help... but its based on my experience.

It's huge, [the interest rate alone for the first five years comes to £215 billion](http://www.gbfans.com/images/ghostbusters/screen-caps/20.jpg), consuming [3% of UK GDP every year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_national_debt) just to maintain the debt, let alone pay if off. North Sea oil provides 1.5% of UK GDP so it's going to be painful to shoulder it all. National debt is usually measured per-capita as well and you are losing 8% of the population. 

This, combined with the costs to rUK business of implementing currency conversions for a large part of their supply chains, is why so many of us are outright cocky on the likelihood of getting at the very least a temporary currency union. It'll have a review period e.g. in 5-10 years time at which point it will be decided what's best for both of us. 

And there's also the issue of the nuclear sub bases which will require a graceful handover lasting several years best-case. Being nice is in everyone's best interests. 

&gt; Not only would it be a new State with no track record of repaying its debts

A state with ongoing assets, we've already been estimated [by Moodies as a 'A' rated](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-27247870) (UK is 'AA') and with [S&amp;P putting us at 'AAA'](http://www.businessforscotland.co.uk/independent-scotland-could-be-aaa-rated-standard-poors/) (the same as the UK)

&gt; but it would be refusing to pay those that it has built up as part of the UK

[Not according to the UK treasury](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25707218).

&gt; a fair share of assets, such as military equipment, other state property etc

A lot of that property is in Scotland. 

As for the military, aside from some aircraft most of the UK's expensive military is of no use to us, we don't seek to ""project power"" around the world and bomb brown people, we'll have our own oil and complete energy independence via renewables [is well within our grasp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_Scotland#Summary_of_Scotland.27s_resource_potential). The UK Navy is set up for blue water duties, something we don't want or need. The army's greatest asset is in it's personnel and that's a personal decision for every one of them, not something to be negotiated.

And why is it such a far stretch for someone to think Borini himself feels that he has improved and wants to stay and play for the club? Especially someone as young as him...

http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/topics/technology--devices-and-online-top8

Specifically:

&gt;Do I need a TV Licence to watch live TV online?
&gt;
&gt;If you watch live TV online – e.g. through BBC iPlayer, ITV &gt;Player, Sky Go, Virgin Media, BT Vision, Apple TV, Now TV, &gt;Chromecast, Roku or Amazon Fire TV – you need a TV Licence.
&gt;
&gt;‘Live TV’ means any programme you watch or record at the &gt;same time as it’s being shown on TV or an online TV service.

And:

&gt;Do I need a TV Licence to watch live TV programmes on an &gt;online-only TV channel?
&gt;
&gt;Yes, you need a TV Licence if you’re watching live programmes &gt;on an online-only TV service.

And finally:

&gt;Do I need a TV Licence to watch live TV programmes from &gt;outside the UK or Channel Islands?
&gt;
&gt;Yes, you need a TV Licence if you watch or record live TV online, &gt;no matter where it is distributed from. This includes online &gt;streamed programmes from outside the UK and Channel &gt;Islands.
&gt;
&gt;‘Live TV’ means any programme you watch or record at the &gt;same time as it’s being shown on TV or an online TV service.

These together kind of make me angry. I have been trying to find a definition of ""TV channel"" or ""TV service"" on the website, to no avail. It looks like the TV licencing rules mean I would need to own a TV licence to watch (on my PC) a YouTube or twitch or Livestream.com channel. The idea that in order to watch Day 9 daily's or Foster Dad Johns kitten live streams legally would require a TV licence is ridiculous.

I watched [this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2004304/?ref_=nv_sr_1) documentary recently and it was a real eye opener. Sylvia Earle is a lifetime diver/National Geographic member of staff and conservationist, so there's an awful lot of Earle worship in it, but it taught me some things about the ecology of oceans that I didn't previously know, and really made me pay attention with some shocking statistics. [Here's her conservation thingy](http://mission-blue.org/). 

I would love to work in an industry such as conservation, but sadly I don't think my personality and temperament would suit. I would never be able to switch off, I'd never sleep &gt; eventual nervous breakdown. That's not just a guess btw, previous experience. That said, I'm trying to get therapy to teach me how not to give as many shits (as well as my current crazy pills), so let's see how that goes. 

&gt;I've never done anything like that (water isnt my strong suit) but I'm guessing you've done it a fair bit?

No, sadly not. I have an ex bf who ran a scuba club and took people all over the world on diving holidays and his passion for it really rubbed off on me. It's something I've never forgotten, and something I know that I could do for a long, long time without getting bored with it, as I have never tired of being in the water when it's not a chlorinated swimming pool.

&gt;

&gt;The __Northern Ireland Assembly__ ([Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): *Tionól Thuaisceart Éireann*,  [Ulster Scots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Scots_dialects): *Norlin Airlan Assemblie*) is the [devolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution) legislature of [Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland). It has power to legislate in a wide range of areas that are not explicitly [reserved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_matters) to the [Parliament of the United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom), and to appoint the [Northern Ireland Executive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Executive). It sits at [Parliament Buildings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Buildings_(Northern_Ireland\)) at [Stormont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormont,_Belfast) in [Belfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast).

&gt;The Assembly is one of two ""mutually inter-dependent"" institutions created under the 1998 [Good Friday Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast_Agreement), the other being the [North/South Ministerial Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North/South_Ministerial_Council) with the [Republic of Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland).  The Agreement aimed at bringing an end to Northern Ireland's violent 30-year [Troubles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles). The Assembly is a [unicameral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicameral), democratically elected body currently comprising 108 members known as [Members of the Legislative Assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(Northern_Ireland\)), or MLAs. Members are elected under the [single transferable vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) form of [proportional representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation). The Assembly selects most of its ministers using the principle of [power-sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consociationalism) under the [D'Hondt method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Hondt_method) to ensure that Northern Ireland's largest political communities, the [unionist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unionism_in_Ireland) and [nationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_nationalism) communities both participate in governing the region. The existence of the Assembly has seen interest in a United Ireland within the Nationalist community decline very markedly, although there may also be other contributory factors to this. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;The Assembly has been suspended on several occasions, the longest suspension being from 14 October 2002 until 7 May 2007. When the Assembly was suspended, its powers reverted to the [Northern Ireland Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Office). Following talks that resulted in the [St Andrews Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews_Agreement) being accepted in November 2006, an [election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election,_2007) to the Assembly was held on 7 March 2007 and full power was restored to the devolved institutions on 8 May 2007. 

&gt;Powers in relation to policing and justice were transferred to the Assembly on 12 April 2010.

&gt;The third assembly was dissolved on 24 March 2011 in preparation for the [elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_Assembly_election,_2011) to be held on Thursday 5 May 2011, this being the first assembly since the Good Friday Agreement to complete a full term.  The fourth assembly convened on 12 May 2011.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;Again WRONG. The census was done in England where the vast majority live and they represent 5.02% - Office for National Statistics. 7/7/2014

No not wrong at all, you are providing the Census data for England only, which was neither asked for, nor is it relevant to this discussion.

Across the whole of the UK the figure is 4.8%. 

&gt;Uh... The CATHOLIC CHURCH. (This is getting laughable now) Even if they're lying to make up numbers it only painted them even worse. Do you seriously think they would UNDER-report the numbers?

Your right this is getting laughable. This has got to be the only time in history that someone who is so anti religion has actually DEFENDED recording data on Christianity. If this was any other situation, such as the Census you would be screaming from the rooftops that most people who call themselves Catholics aren't really, and its just what their parents put down, so now they do the same. 

But in this case you are willing to defend the accuracy of the recordings of the religious affiliations of the prison population 100%, simply because it is convenient for you. The truth is, if you wan't to have any consistency in your beliefs you have to accept that both the total number of Christians in this country, and the number in prisons is probably much lower.

In contrast, The vast majority of people who identify as Muslim, are Muslim.  

&gt;Uh... The CATHOLIC CHURCH.

Just on this point, since you considered it so laughable, you still haven't actually provided where you got your information from. The Catholic church only records attendance, not who Identify as a Catholic. The census only records who Identify as Christian, not what denomination, or how many attend church.  If you are basing your opinion solely on church attendance then your figures are going to be way off, because I would bet money that the cross over between people who identify as Catholic in prison, and Catholics who attend church regularly is statistically negligible, meaning your whole argument is based off of totally incorrect data. 

&gt;A google search brings them up as the TOP results - your google skills are worse than your stats skills.

And you need to work on your reading comprehension. I KNOW the breakdown of Christian denominations within the prison population, as that is information available from the prison service. What I asked you was where did you get your figures from on the number of CATHOLICS in the UK, because that information is NOT recorded on the census. 

As I have already explained, if you are getting your figures from the Catholic church itself you are going to be making judgements on poor quality information, because they will only record the number of church attendants, not the number of people who self identify as Catholics.

&gt;Cultural isolation and influences did not cause the banks to rig the LIBOR rate, launder money for terrorist groups, avoid massive taxes, breach sanctions or mislead investors.

Yes they did. The culture within the banks at the time created a generation of bankers and managers who thought they were untouchable and that they could do anything, that profit was the be all and end all, and that risk and fraud and illegal behaviour was all a part of the game.

Culture isn't just for foreigners, its whatever we surround ourselves with on a daily basis. As I said before, we are all a product of our environments. 

&gt;And the main types of people who commit banking fraud are non-practicing, university educated, white people - just like you. Do you work for a bank by any chance?

And there is a reason they commit bank fraud, and It most likely has something to do with there surroundings. Why do you think anyone does anything? It might be because of their background, or their upbringing. It certainly isn't because they are white, as you are suggesting, that would be as ridiculous as me suggesting that Muslims are over represented in the prison population because most of them are brown. It doesn't make any sense.

- Overhaul of the planning system.  Developers should be able to build more and when there is conflict they should be able to pay more Section 106 contributions to get round it and not be held up by the whims of local councillors and officials.
- Climate change should be dealt with by moving to nuclear energy.  Nearly all other measures should be scrapped.  New runways should be built at Heathrow and Gatwick.  
- Child benefit scrapped (Grandfathered in.)   
- People in council houses should be charged market rate.  Housing benefit should be the same rate for everyone.  Council tenants should be allowed to sublet.  (Brought in progressively over a number of years.)
- Health and safety regulations should be reviewed, with an emphasise on the cost/death ratio.  The cost/death ratio should probably be lowered.

- Age of mandatory schooling lowered.  Children start jobs and apprentices in parallel with school.  
- Scrapping of nearly all funding for degrees and qualifications which do not teach hard skills that can be applied in the jobs market.  (Such as history, politics, english, sociology) Obviously some funding will still be available for those wanting to become researchers, academics or teachers.

One of them was in the pocket of a major estate agents and kept trying to persuade us to increase our borrowing potential and the other one was so slow and kept messing up our application that we almost lost the flat we'd put an offer in on. The third guy was just fantastic from start to finish, understood our situation completely, knew exactly which lenders to go with and who would be more likely to accept us and he didn't charge us a penny for putting through the application either - so I'm really glad we shopped around!


We were in a similar situation to you (Good deposit but no real credit to speak of, I'd gone back to uni and my boyfriend had just started a new job!) and our mortgage broker eventually got around the issue by applying for a special mortgage through Coventry Building Society where we could get a relative to sign onto the mortgage as a guarantor but they could then be taken off after a year of regular payment.

You don't have to be a 'shitty country' to peg to another's currency, but what you do need if you intend to be stable is a mechanism to act as a shock absorber as the country with the monetary control makes changes.  This is typically managed by the pegged currency's government running a budget surplus.

'Pegged' in this sense means Scotland running not a deficit as it is doing  but a surplus, which either means raising taxes, cutting spending, or a timed combination of the two.  Scotland is well in its means to do this, but it is whether there is the *political* capital to increase taxes or cut spending with the electorate, and to what extent. Cuts in Scotland's case to return a surplus on their current spending would have to be rather severe.
 
The other alternative is Scotland floating its own currency, but where capitalisation will be called for to make it stable. Oil alone is not conducive due to its tendency to fluctuate.  Scotland would be required to leverage capital, which in itself implies privatisation and selling of assets.

So those are the choices, and it's the exact same choices that apply to all other independent countries looking to either float or peg a currency.",0,1410303290,null,0,false,0,ckdvf7s,t3_2fxryd,t1_ckdvf7s,t1_ckdt02q,null,1427101782,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Paul places too much emphasis on deregulation of industry - claiming that standards would not drop because the market and the law would keep people safe and quality high. This would only be true if people were well-informed (when we're often ignorant or misinformed - misinformation potentially originating from industry itself) and if our legal systems were designed to be corruption-proof and to punish individuals with jail sentences rather than fining companies an inconsequential amount of money. 

Paul also supports lower taxes so that individuals and companies can operate at a lower cost and so do more. Whilst this sounds nice, I think taxes can be very helpful if used properly. As an example, after enjoying 70 years of antibiotics - we once again have to be scared of dying from a minor cut because bacteria have evolved a resistance to current drugs. Research of new drugs is expensive and the reward to companies is very low. Government subsidies are an important way of side-stepping the selfish profit-incentive of capitalism, but Paul would remove the power of government to direct the market in long-sighted ways.

My general view has already been expressed in this thread. No more nanny-state. If somebody wants to do something to themselves or consensually with others, and no harm is done (hard to define - I know - but a definition can be reached) then it should be legal.

&gt; ...

&gt; The Finnish politician said that an independent Scotland would have to apply to join the EU under the Treaty on European Union.

&gt; He said: ""One core part of the economic conditions under the Treaty is that any candidate country must be committed to the Economic and Monetary Union, which implies the will and expected capacity to meet the convergence criteria of euro membership in due course, as well as the existence of a competent monetary authority in the form of an independent central bank.

&gt; ""As to the question whether 'sterlingisation' were compatible with EU membership, the answer is that this would simply not be possible, since that would obviously imply a situation where the candidate country concerned would not have a monetary authority of its own, and thus no necessary instruments of the EMU.""

I get that winning this referendum would be a stupendous achievement and that it would be a difficult path (but one they obviously believe they can walk) for Scotland. 

However the constant implication of this that is thrown around is that all No voters are making their decision out of fear, or are buying in to the No vote's ""scare tactics"". It's demeaning to all those who are making a measured decision based on a lot of complicated factors and it sometime comes across as pretty cheap jingoistic nationalism.



&gt;If Labour has any political nous, any remaining flicker of courage, it will understand what this moment means. Instead of suppressing the forces of hope and inspiration, it would mobilise them. It would, for instance, pledge, in its manifesto, a referendum on drafting a written constitution for the rest of the UK.

This is essentially emotional blackmail and seems like a pleading cry to throw logic out of the window. Whatever he has to write to appease his more radical younger self's imprint on his conscience is his own business, why hide it under the guise of supposedly serious piece of political analysis.

&gt;Already, the myth of political apathy has been scotched by the tumultuous movement north of the border. As soon as something is worth voting for, people will queue into the night to add their names to the register. The low voter turnouts in Westminster elections reflect not an absence of interest but an absence of hope.

Completely agree with this however, give people a real choice and people will want to choose.

Is Steven Moffat a feminist? I'm going to say ""No"" because as far as I'm aware he doesn't claim to be one. Being less misogynistic than the average showrunner is NOT the same as being a feminist. Someone is a feminist when they claim that label for themselves, because they believe in and work towards the end of sexism and the liberation of women.... 

Is he a sexist? Probably, but then ~~most men~~ most of us are to a greater or lesser extent. ^singing: ^everyone's ^a ^little ^bit ^sexist, ^sometimes... 

Is Steven Moffat a misogynist? Let's be clear on what that means: calling someone a misogynist is to say that they actively dislike, or even hate women. A sexist doesn't have to hate women, they just have to prefer men and value masculine things over women and feminine things.

Is he the showrunner of a major prime time show, working in an industry which suffers from [institutional sexism and racism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism#United_Kingdom) and hasn't done anything on screen or off to seriously challenge it? Yes. Was Amy Pond's ""kiss-o-gram"" outfit, for instance, a blatant piece of [""something for the dads""?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9_i6tiAzw0) Yes. 

In that context writing a really long take down of Hollywood.com listicle is not really a serious response to a serious problem, or something I give any credibility too. 

An observation: Some pudding headed feminists can't let themselves enjoy any cultural product without it being actively feminist (rather than just non-sexist.) I think this applies on BOTH sides of the Steven Moffat argument. 

update: I went back and read some more, but it was long and boring and too much about himself... 

I love a lot of what Steven Moffat has done with Doctor Who. I absolutely want to see a female re-generation of the Doctor in a future series, but I think that Matt Smith and Peter Capaldi were both brilliant choices. If I made a list of my favourite episodes (which I don't do because I love all Doctor Who equally) he would probably feature heavily, and I've seen more than enough of ClassicWho to give other people a good shout.

I'd add some sort of basic accommodation so that people could visit, stop over, or live there short term, and provide attractions for day visitors too.

As a dream it's great, but it would crash and burn quite quickly and then I'd go off and spend the rest of the loot on my own. Which would be a result just the same.

---

&gt;In the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom), the inquiry about the murder of the black Briton Stephen Lawrence concluded that the investigating [police force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policing_in_the_United_Kingdom) was institutionally racist. Sir William Macpherson used the term as a description of ""the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin"", which ""can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes, and behaviour, which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness, and racist stereotyping, which disadvantages minority ethnic people"".  Sir William’s definition is almost identical to Stokely Carmichael’s original definition some forty years earlier. Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamilton 1967 were black power activists and first used the term 'institutional racism' to describe the consequences of a societal structure that was stratified into a racial hierarchy that resulted in layers of discrimination and inequality for minority ethnic people in housing, income, employment, education and health (Garner 2004:22).

However this is not really an option as Scotland would not be able to maintain this fixed rate for long.

This exact situation unfolded in the UK and was known as [Black Wednesday](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Wednesday).

In fact the only way this fixed rate could be sustained for any length, is if it is maintained by the Bank of England itself, as this would be the only organisation which could buy Scottish Pounds for GBP without running out (they can always print more).

I don't expect Cleverly to start, to be honest. If Lambert hadn't put Sanchez straight into the team, I doubt that Cleverly would be put in straight away. 

We are away and I reckon if both Vlaar and Okore are fit, we will see Lambert playing 5 at the back for the first time this season. In midfield we would most likely see Westwood, Delph and Richardson/N'Zogbia.

In attack, Weimann would play alongside Agbonlahor.

I reckon it would work, but only if those 3 defenders are fit. ",0,1410311769,null,0,false,0,ckdzhcx,t3_2fyg1h,t1_ckdzhcx,t3_2fyg1h,null,1427099817,2,false,avfc,t5_2s569,2
