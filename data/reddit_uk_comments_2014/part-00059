true,badge,null,null,"Firstly, I should say Birmingham city centre; the metropolitan area is pretty well-served. The principle problem is that Birmingham New Street was built in the 1960s to cater for 650 trains and 60,000 passengers a day. Last year it coped with 1,400 trains and [140,000 passengers](http://www.railway-technology.com/features/featurenetwork-rail-birmingham-new-street-video/).

The station has 12 platforms broken into two sections each, yet on the east side 12 tracks reduce to just *four* for the tunnel under Moor Street. As a result a train being late frequently affects others as they are stuck waiting, especially on the east side on the six track section by ThinkTank.

Besides there being a large number of platforms served by only a few tracks, the platforms themselves are on the whole very narrow (the only exception being platforms 8 and 9, which are wide in comparison), the roof is low and lighting is poor.

To 'solve' these problems the [Gateway Plus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Plus) project is currently under way to improve the station. This includes the removal of waiting rooms from the platforms to free up space, and the redesign of the entire concourse area. What it doesn't include is an increase in size of any of the platforms nor an improvement of the track infrastructure around the station itself. Because the structure of the station at the basement level (and largely ground level) is not changing, it is still claustrophobic and while the new ventilation fans may improve overall air quality, when the Cross Country trains are waiting on an opposite platform the diesel fumes are awful.

Basically it's a total mess, and what's being done to correct it isn't going to solve many of the problems, and those that it will solve will rear their heads again by the mid 2020s. There was a fantastic opportunity for a new terminal station at Curzon Street that could serve both HS2 and other trains, however once the New New Street is no-longer fit for purpose that area will be taken up and there will be limited options to improve things.",0,1393603636,null,0,false,0,cfqzq0n,t3_1z2sv9,t1_cfqzq0n,t1_cfqegoi,null,1432599295,2,false,uktrains,t5_2z9xu,2

&gt;The **Gateway Plus** (previously known as **Birmingham Gateway**) project is a redevelopment scheme to regenerate [Birmingham New Street railway station](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_New_Street_railway_station) and the [Pallasades Shopping Centre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallasades_Shopping_Centre) above it in [Birmingham](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham), [England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England). The project aims to enhance the station to cope with increased passenger numbers as well as expected future growth in traffic, but will not alter the train capacity of the station. In 2008, the station handled passenger numbers far in excess of the capacity of its existing design. The current station and Pallasades shopping centre were completed in 1967 and have become the subject of criticism for the congestion of the station and shabbiness of the shopping centre and parts of the station.  It is part of the [Big City Plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_City_Plan).

&gt;These types of comments are so pathetically sad.

&gt;His initial comment was sad enough, this just makes me feel a bit sorry for the guy.

&gt; As for Liverpool fans being smug, that would be because during one of the worst 20 year spans in their history they STILL have managed to win more trophies and be more important than the shithole of a team you follow.

This is literally just comment replies I've gotten in the past 12 hours **IN THE TOTTENHAM SUBREDDIT**. You really think you lot aren't smug fucks?

&gt; pretentious, spiteful

Every comment against Liverpool's fans on the Tottenham subreddit has 50+ downvotes. You really think that doesn't reek of you guys thinking you're better than you actually are? You really think that isn't indicative of a spiteful fanbase? I'm just curious as to where those comments were linked to because I'm sure the comments there will just further prove my point

&gt; unbearable

[This is my favorite one](http://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/1z4gci/motm_thread_tottenham_vs_dnipro/cfqvabf). Your moron friend there not only went to the trouble of trawling through *7 pages of my comment history* to find out where I was from, the best part is **he was absolutely wrong**. So naturally, more vote brigading because ""hurr durr, American says he's not American!"" when in fact it's more along the lines of ""Hurr durr, Venezuelan citizen and Taiwanese resident says he's not American!"" So yeah, congrats. You lot get a gold star for that shit show. 

Now let me admit to one thing: a gross bit of overgeneralizing. There's some lovely, lovely Liverpool fans that I respect the opinions of and have have discussions with when I can (/u/severedfragile being chief among them, and posters on /r/soccer in general). Let me be clear: **i am not talking about those fans**. Let me also clarify that I am not talking about Liverpool the team. Gerrard is a brilliant player, Torres was one of my favorite players back in the late 00's, and Suarez, despite his occasional dirtiness, is brilliant and apparently my celebrity doppelganger so he's got that going for them. What I am talking about though, are the Liverpool fans that get up in arms over the fact that someone on another subreddit said something bad about them (;; sorry about your feelings). I'm talking about the ones that will go in and downvote en masse an opinion on another team's subreddit that they don't like. The ones that will go on a crusade to try and discredit someone's opinion and be completely wrong. In short, my friend, I'm talking about *you*. Yes, you, the Liverpool fan reading this who has probably already downvoted everyone they don't recognize. You are the smug, unbearable fuck I'm talking about. Make no mistake. You are a petty little shit and I'm sure you'll downvote me because you're a special snowflake (mommy told me so ;;).

I've already shown that I'm not wrong, with just examples from this thread.

I don't know of, but would be interested to find out if any players have kit numbers retired based on their playing career.

The difference between Torres and everyone else with negative qualities is that all of our other players have positive qualities to balance them.

While it's true that Torres and Eto'o have scored at a similar rate, Eto'o has a shot every 24 min. compared to Torres 31 and hits the target 46% of the time compared to Torres 37%.  Eto'o has also completed 78% of his passes compared to Torres 60%.  Eto'o has a worse take-on % (33 to 42) but has attempted 20 fewer.  Eto'o has also created a chance every 61 min. compared to Torres 97.  In all Torres loses the ball (failed pass/take-on) once every 7 minutes (Eto'o=12) which is the lowest (i.e. worst) on our team.

&gt;**Scouse** is a type of [lamb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_and_mutton) or [beef](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef) stew. The word comes from lobscouse, a [stew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stew) commonly eaten by sailors throughout Northern Europe, which became popular in [seaports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port) such as [Liverpool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool).

Key bits at the end:

&gt;  Andrew Davis, of law firm DWF Fishburns, said if a transaction was completed the customer had the right to keep the product for the price they paid. This included customers whose goods have been dispatched and were waiting to receive them.

&gt; What are your rights?

&gt; Retailers do not have to honour an advertised price that has been mistakenly knocked down and have the right to cancel orders.

&gt; Online the situation is not as clear. A contract needs to exist between the retailer and the customer – this usually occurs when a retailer accepts an order.

&gt; Carefully check the wording in your email – if it simply acknowledges your order, there is no contract. If it accepts your order it is likely that a contract has been entered into. Some websites say an order has only been accepted when the goods are dispatched. Check the site's terms and conditions if you are unsure. 

The fact they've despatched ""incorrect"" goods means they're well past the point at which they can cancel the order I think...",0,1393606508,null,0,false,0,cfr0zk9,t3_1z6jl2,t1_cfr0zk9,t1_cfr08ra,null,1432599899,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

I can see two farms there and that's about it, so it's probably not the first place I'd worry about. Also, I'm pretty sure most roads don't go straight up those hills.

&gt; I also agree, what I'm saying is that we'd need to throw so much money at it and make so many reforms that I don't realistically see it happening any time soon.

With attitudes like that, no. When people get tired of kids getting ran over and the population getting fatter and the air quality getting worse they may fancy a change. As for the cost, it pays for itself in the long run. Sadly, long term thinking isn't something that politicians are very good at.

Anyway, a few hours later Dave wakes up and stumbles to the police station to tell his tale.  A copper takes him for a ride along to see if he can see the lady.  Dave points her out and they stop.  The lady denies all knowledge of the attack.

At this point Dave decides to complain to the cop not about the attack but the lack of ""service"" agreed to by him and the lady and he wants his blowjob.

I've already said that I probably should have specified I meant ""some Liverpool fans"" but I thought that was implied since, you know, it's kind of difficult to make a true blanket statement about thousands of people that delve any deeper than ""Liverpool fans like Liverpool.""

But the thing is, the ones that responded to my post, the ones that came in and downvoted everything they didn't like to oblivion just proved my point. The ones that responded with ""These comments are so sad"" and ""I feel sorry for him"" don't sound in the slightest bit smug? For the love of christ, I pictured them making [this face](http://i37.photobucket.com/albums/e51/poundnground_photos/south_park_smug.jpg) as they pressed enter. One of those idiots trawled through 200 of my comments to try and prove that I was lying about not being American and ended up being wrong. Not like it matters, the rest of you guys downvoted me regardless. 

I've said in plenty of other posts, I don't have a problem with Liverpool the team. There are some Liverpool fans whose opinions I enormously respect and enjoy having discussions with. But this is not an isolated incident and it makes *all* of you look bad. There's just as much shit talking about Tottenham fans going on in your thread and nobody has linked back to it here. I *never* see /r/LiverpoolFC getting linked here. Maybe once over the summer a year or two ago. And I know shit talking goes on there because it goes on everywhere and for whatever reason, Liverpool fans don't like Tottenham much.

&gt; But, that doesn't make your post anymore worthwhile. It's down to your sub to choose what is worthy of your sub, though.

Which is what my point comes down to. This is /r/LiverpoolFC trying to come in and dictate what is acceptable or not on /r/coys. If I posted the same exact rant but instead changed ""Liverpool"" to ""Manchester United"", do you think it would be getting 100+ downvotes? Even if I posted about Arsenal or Chelsea fans (and I have done before), it wouldn't be getting downvotes dumped on like that. Don't get me wrong, I don't give a shit about the karma itself. It's the idea of it that really has done little to sway my view that you guys have a more immature fanbase than others on reddit. Surely there are exceptions, but maybe the floor of yours is lower than others. This little episode has done nothing to change my mind, honestly. It's not even something I obsess about either because I know someone's going to come in and accuse me of it because I've posted about this a few times this morning because honestly it's the only interesting thing going on and I have nothing better to do for the next couple of hours. 

But yeah, there you have it. Come by sometime on your own when you're not vote brigading us (and maybe on a day when Liverpool fans on /r/soccer aren't having a collective shit fit despite a match ending in a favorable way to them) and you'll probably have a much different reception if you're actually trying to have a conversation.",0,1393607215,null,0,false,0,cfr1bcp,t3_1z4gci,t1_cfr1bcp,t1_cfr0v5h,null,1432600045,-2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,-2

Even if it's not true, I think his arc will involve a lot of Time Lord politics. 

Those of us whose only exposure to the series is New Who know they'll be back, but not yet that that's not necessarily the pure awesome thing Ecclestone and Tennant's Doctors made it sound. When they reminisced about their people to companions, they never mentioned the ruthless politicking or that he wasn't always on their best side. Capaldi's Doctor will show us that. 

I think the series will be pretty much about reinventing the Doctor, making him more like an Old Who Doctor than the last few were, just like Ecclestone was intended to introduce a modern Doctor to a new generation. Maybe that's why there are rumours he'll only be around for a season: because his arc will be about returning the Time Lords and acclimatising viewers to a completely different Doctor, a more Time Lord-y character.

I think Matt Smith's entire run was about returning the rest of the universe to a more Old Who state. Much of RTD's era has been retconned out of canon and everyone's memory by the cracks. Technologically weaker but politically savvy Daleks willing to form alliances of convenience replace RTD's all-powerful but moronic ones. Cybermen from *this* universe return as do many, many Old Who monsters who hadn't been seen in decades. UNIT is reintroduced to new viewers as the replacement to the Torchwood of RTD's era.

Now the universe mythology has been retconned into an Older Who state, it's been made ready for the return of the Time Lords and an Old Who Doctor. That's what I think. I think from the moment Moffat took over he's been basically saying ""EXTERMINATE"" to everything RTD did and has been trying to restore Who to its original state, and I think Capaldi's season will be the last step in that process and Capaldi's successor (or Capaldi himself, if the one-season-Doctor rumours are false) will start afresh in a setting that will barely resemble seasons 1-7 in terms of tone and scope.",0,1393607538,null,0,1393615370,0,cfr1gpu,t3_1z6qu1,t1_cfr1gpu,t3_1z6qu1,null,1432600115,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Shows really how big a factor belief and self-confidence is in a striker's game, his finishing has been ruthless this season but even more so is his audacity like his chipped goal against Everton.

Northerners rarely class us as 'southern softies' because we've got the east-end thug  thing going on combined with the rural farmer essex hay chewing type, the west doesn't think we're stuck-up [or gheto] like london, London doesn't think we're yokles likes they think of the entire rest of the country...  The only place that genuinely sneers at essex is the place pretty much everywhere else hates, the posh bit -hated in the west country, all over the north, by Londoners.... [and i'm not counting Kent because kents cool]
  
Everyone jokes about Essex because really everyone's kinda buddies with Essex, we're the butt of the jokes because no one really thinks there's anyones going to take it personally - it's just buddies joshing around.  In a way it's almost like everyone likes essex way too much and has to kinda act all cool about it.  
  
[i mean really](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-JIzWFfsPk) this sort of cool can't be nullified by any amount of Joey Essex's - it's the very epitome of the british working class; it's strong, it's proud, unabashed yet also it's wholesome in the most visceral sense, it's not taking itself seriously but it's not messing around - no one takes something like Towie seriously because they know we find it funny too, they know we're just fucking with them -playing with them in that jovial self-effacing way and they're just laughing along as buddies do.  
  
So when someone jokes about Towie then joke about getting a vajazzle and that's that, it's just an easy shared joke and better than having nothing to say - or tell them you're oldschool and joke about having a ford cortina / dancing around your handbag...

With a front 3 of SASAS you could choose a defensive minded midfield and still be very effective offensively. We could play 2 dms lucas and gerrard with Hendo or coutinho in front but our best performances this season (spurs) were without gerrard. It really is one of those situations where we are sacrificing defensive stability to accommodate for stevie. A lucas/Hendo or lucas/allen partnership is more balanced because they have the engine needed to press nonstop while lucas provides that protection. It sucks because stevie has been performing so well but it feels like something needs to change to help relieve the pressure on our defense.

It shouldn't be too hard to find someone who can advise on offshore products. The biggest issue will be finding someone who can give advice to you whilst you're overseas, because that requires additional permissions from the FCA which most advice firms don't carry. If you do have an address in the UK that you can use, it is possible to work around the rules.

There are specialist ex-pat advice firms that would be able to help, but I've no experience of them and would guess that they are not necessarily the cheapest because of their specialist nature.

I'm also a huge Star Wars fan, and while I enjoyed the Clone Wars cartoon, the whole affair was a bit more interesting when it was more of a mystery. The problem with bringing something like the Time War or Clone Wars to the screen (or speakers) is that it's something that's been used within the mythology to explain away so many little peices of the story that to attempt a portrayal is to step all over continuity that falls apart when you try to string it all together. Fans will be divided over retcons and ""raped childhoods"", angry letters will be sent, etc. Not to mention the fact that the Time War takes place over hundreds of years, so where do you even pick up the story?

&gt;A motion that sought to ban segregation in any EUSA venues and buildings has been voted down. At a meeting on Thursday 6th February, the motion, proposed by the Humanist Society, was rejected on the basis of it’s alleged Islamophobic nature.

&gt;Edinburgh students vote against motion opposing gender segregation. That motion fell heavily, after a number of opposing speeches which either stated or implied that the society’s motivations were racist and Islamophobic”.

And you see only the positives. The main issue most supporters of UKIP have is not with immigrants, [in fact Farage publicly called for Syrian refugees to be allowed into UK](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-25539843), something which the Conservatives had refused to do and neither Labour nor the Lib Dems had suggested. Farage is also married to a German women with dual-nationality kids.

&gt;Farage isn't interested in changing EU. He thinks best way for UK is outside of EU

That's because you can't change anything in the EU thanks to France. We made an official agreement under Tony Blair to halve our rebate, if France halved it's CAP payments (another form of rebate), we halved our rebate and then France did a u-turn and refused to reduce it's CAP. It now receives more CAP than the rest of Europe put together, even when there's many new and poorer countries that desperately need it. They also refuse the EU's books to be audited, and some economists calculate corruption within EU spending to be higher than the total GDP of Ukraine, they also refuse to close the circus that is Strasbourg that costs us billions for a few weeks every year totally unnecessarily. Every EU country other than France wants these things to change, but France has a lock in or veto on every decision, so nothing can happen.

true,trasofsunnyvale,null,null,"Well, I guess if not responding to rather hateful words about Liverpool or responding angrily is better than responding with ""this is pathetic"" or ""boy, this seems excessive"" than fine. I'll make a note that that style of communication is better. Perhaps no one should've responded at all, but I feel as if I should stick up for the club and the vast majority of its fans who are quite reasonable.

I think a lot of the reaction is due to saying Liverpool fans are smug. Delusional? Often. Reactionary? Definitely. Biased? Of course. I don't think we're smug, though. As you say, we have little to be smug about in the past 20 years, outside of Istanbul and a few other cups. I don't personally like your initial comment, and not just due to disagreeing with the sentiment of disliking LFC supporters, but also because your stated reasons don't seem to make sense.

Further, as touched on, a very similar attitude surrounded Tottenham when they qualified for CL, which is sort of what irks me. Somehow Spurs were seen as doing everything ""the right way"" regardless of actual success, just as you maintain Liverpool are being treated at the moment. 

While I agree that Liverpool is being a bit elevated (I'd assume due to the media understanding the colossal fanbase and potential for clicks/papers sold, etc.) do not mistake the media portrayal of Liverpool with the self-assessment of nearly every Liverpool redditor active on /r/liverpoolfc. I think that was why it irked us so much--it isn't accurate to our sub. 

I'm sorry for the vote brigading, it is certainly childish. But I'd probably say your initial comment was rather impassioned, just as the response was.

positives: free trade no matter what, one european country cannot boycott another and no tariffs? bigger negotiating power on the global stage. our membership in the e.u means we are apart of the worlds biggest economic power bigger than america and china therefore i guess no one would want to piss us off by doing shit like raising trading tariffs.

negatives: we have to abide to all of their rules including the ones that are pure bullshit. backward agricultural policy (which i dont really know a lot about) that raises the average price of most foods to ensure a ""fair deal"" for farmers, thus decreasing competition. cases that it restricts out ability to trade with the BRIC economies which could prove to be good shit for our exports. aaaaannnndddd net migration. it seems well i feel like if you say our european open borders or our immigration policy in general is shit as we are letting way too many people in youre immediately a racist xenophobe member of the edl but im not. i dont give a fuck what race you are. looking at it pragmatically, there are a lot of people unemployed right now. why would you let more people in? (unless they were trained in a field that we lacked in). it just doesnt make sense. it makes as much sense as stopping immigration in a time like the late 1940s and 50s when there were an abundance of jobs to be filled, so yes let immigrants in to fill the jobs.

this looks like i briefed over the positives but obviously free tariffs are a really important part of our trade as i assume most of our imports/exports come from the e.u

I just don't believe in treating mammoth, outwardly corrupt companies (or governments) like people. Any corporation over a certain size or with too much power eventually push the boundaries on morality and so called ethics, it's the cycle of life.

I mean, what exactly are we referring to here when we say ethics anyway? Theres varying levels. Paying for the bbc licence out of some moral duty even when I dont watch it? Starving the poorest in society and putting them on something as disgusting as workfare? Mugging an old lady? Pirating music or using VPNs (which I don't do anyhow, but I'm well aware of how it's done)?..they're all very very different things. 

Heres one for ethics, should corporations give over their taxes without the government forcing them too? I hear many say yes, I say no. A powerful corporation will almost always behave like the worst of humanity, but we elected the government to represent us and put these regulations in place for fairness and transparency only to find out that they are not working for us, but seemingly against us in every way. So why are those types of ethics almost always promoted and given control over joe public, and the person who pirates becomes the monster? Not saying both can't be bad, but we really need to get some proportion. The phrase 'lead by example' comes to mind.

Add to that the lack of regulation or recourse for complaints...

The advice I read is that getting into Vanguard ETFs with a portfolio like (http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Lazy_portfolios) would be a smart move but getting access to the ETFs seems quite tricky and then i read that they are subject to 30% witholding tax as a non-US resident..

In that article, under the graph, is a link to a pdf of the actual figures. To quote:

&gt;532,000 people immigrated to the UK in the year ending September 2013, not a statistically
significant difference from 497,000 the previous year. 60,000 more EU citizens and 25,000 fewer
non-EU citizens immigrated to the UK than the previous year.

&gt; 320,000 emigrants left the UK in the year ending September 2013. This is not a statistically
significant difference from the 343,000 in the previous year. 12,000 fewer British citizens, 6,000
fewer EU citizens and 5,000 fewer non-EU citizens emigrated.

This meant that there were around 35,000 more people entering the UK in 2013 than 2012, and around 15,000 less people leaving the UK in 2013 than 2012. This led to net immigration increasing from 150,000 to 200,000. In a country of 65 million people, I don't feel an increase of 50,000 on net migration is this pilgrimage of biblical proportions that parties like UKIP are suggesting. There is a reason a lot of headlines led with '30% increase' instead of '50,000 increase', because it has more of an impact on people who do think millions of people are coming in.

Also, there were more non-EU migrants (250,000) than EU ones (200,000), and while there was a decrease in non-EU migrants and an increase in EU ones, I think it shows that immigration isn't all to blame on Brussels and the EU forcing us.

EDIT: Also, I'd like the point out that 176,000 of those 532,000 immigrant came to study, and 218,000 of them to work, so it isn't simply a case of 500,000 people all coming here to take houses and jobs.",0,1393612657,null,0,1393612903,0,cfr3v7o,t3_1z6tez,t1_cfr3v7o,t1_cfr3cn2,null,1432601246,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

true,shabouwcaw,lfc99,,"hey, I actually did a similar assignment in my course, particularly about secondary PTSD in Hillsborough and the tortious test for same. I am a Liverpool fan, so I obviously came at it from that angle, but I think there are many important factors to look at, especially if you come at it from the perspective of the negative media reporting at the time (e.g. the S*n) and how that potentially impacted upon how cases were decided. When I wrote the essay, none of the public apologies or reports had been published, but there's even more evidence to suggest police failure and culpability (in terms of direct negligence and failure to act) now, so there's definitely an argument to be made that had those cases been tried in a world where smears on Liverpool supporters post Hillsborough had not happened they would have received more sympathetic judgments, having full access to the facts. 

The biggest distinction to be made is where the South Yorkshire police received payouts in their cases, but most fan cases, especially in incidences of secondary victims, were not found in their favour. You would have to ask, ceteris paribus, why it is that police officers were held to have PTSD and those who also suffered from it, but were not officers, were not; I made the argument that the smearing of fans by media influenced that calculus. 

As far as background on the tragedy is concerned, the more recent factual reports into the disaster, such as the Independent Panel report linked earlier, is perhaps the best place to find information. Due to the cover-ups and slurs, I would be wary of reading factual recounts of the *actual events* that are in law books, since unless they're recent editions, they can be pretty off.

&gt; Do you include all single sex schools in this?

Yes. I really can't think of any compelling reason why children benefit from being separated by sex. [This article](http://www.greatschools.org/find-a-school/defining-your-ideal/1139-single-sex-education-the-pros-and-cons.gs?page=all) I quickly skimmed through seemed to show that all the pros for single-sex education assume uniformity between all boys and uniformity between all girls. 

&gt; What about division by age/ability?

There is a large difference between the mental capabilities of, say, a 5 year old and an 11 year old, or an 11 year old and a 16 year old. This is why we segregate classes by age. Also, while in a single-sex school we are preventing children from seeing another person their age of a different sex for the entire school day, segregation by age doesn't prevent younger children seeing older children at school, and vice-verse.

true,kde01,king,,"&gt;Maybe this is confirmation bias, but check the stats and see if I'm &gt;wrong - we drop points we shouldn't drop after a midweek European &gt;game. Maybe if we had the extra millions we could afford a squad to &gt;compete on all fronts, but we don't. If we need to rest our world class &gt;players we don't have world class players to fill in for them.

So 100 M wasn't enough? I think that was a pretty good investment, and we got great players for it. Players that were mismanaged and a core team that went unchanged. Why weren't we playing Lamela more often against lower sides? Gylfi? We have so many players at our disposal, most of them quite good. A good manager will get the best of them and make them perform.

&gt;We're not, and I only think we should screw the EL due to the miles &gt;and flights. 

We're not flying out to Vladivostok. We're going a 3-4 hour flight away at the worst. We spend more time traveling within England sometimes. How long do you think it will take us to go to Southampton? About 2 hours. How long is the flight to Benfica? 2.5 hours. The travel issue is a total myth. If you players get tired out from a 4 hour plane ride then we need new players.

&gt;They do hurt them as well. City and Chelsea can handle it with their &gt;squads but Arsenal struggle after a midweek game.

Arsenal did pretty well last weekend after getting beat to the ground and left with 10 men against the top club in the world. We have no excuses going down 3 points on Sunday after playing midweek. 

&gt;We're not a top side, and don't have those things, so why pretend &gt;we do and go after a cup that is nothing more than a money grab for &gt;UEFA? 

I don't disagree that it's a moneygrab. But it's very valuable to us. The game is about glory, is it not? We are a club with a long history in Europe, and we should take pride in our involvement in European competition. *Any* European competition. We're going to go, and we're going to do our best to win. We may struggle for a few years with trying to juggle European cups, domestic cups, and the league but we're building towards a future where competing across multiple fronts is a necessity. What continental player do you think would want to come for us if we just bomb out of the EL or even the CL every year to focus on the league?

You keep telling me you think it's a waste of time, and I know many agree with you. But honest question here - how well do you think we'll fare in the CL if we don't get practice year over year in the EL? When we get in the CL what then - do we then forgo the league in favor of the CL? ",0,1393613878,null,0,false,0,cfr4gpb,t3_1z6u1u,t1_cfr4gpb,t1_cfr44ch,null,1432601529,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

As a businessman of some 40 years I have no problem with the concept of striving to ensure that anyone who works should receive a living wage but to have this clown pontificating that 'the economy' can afford it really gets my fucking goat.

I am sure there are a lot of companies who are doing quite well and who could perhaps reward better but what about those companies, usually smaller, who are struggling to keep the doors open. I know of many a businessman who's chest would burst with pride if they could get their position to be one of paying a living wage instead of where they are now when every day they face the fear of how they are going to find the wages this week, never mind an above inflation increase. I have never heard of 'the economy' stepping in to help in those dark days.

Nor have I heard of 'the economy' stepping in to ensure that the big business pays the small man in a reasonable amount of time to relieve cash flow problems.

Nor have I ever heard of  'the economy' stepping in to help the smaller man get his fair crack at any government or quango spend, local or otherwise. I have heard of 'the economy' bringing in complex tender processes for such work which make it nigh on impossible for the smaller man to even get involved.

As you might gather I was a smaller businessman but don't be mistaken. I was rather successful and my staff were well rewarded but this clown telling us what we can or cannot afford just gets me fucking going. 

Leave it to us you fucking muppet! We aren't trying to grow our businesses for the hell of it or to treat our staff badly. We are doing our best in extremely difficult circumstances to do well. If you really want to help, start a business, employ a few people and then make the rules from a position of experience. Until then leave us be!

That being said, goals/minute is also a good stat, thanks. The reason I chose goals/start over goals/minute is because not all minutes are equal, as I said above.

I know, right.

I've been spoiled by watching shows like Firefly and Star Trek: TNG, and even stuff like Game of Thrones. They are just more well written. I'm probably gonna get crucified for this, but this show sucks as it it. The characters are boring and uncharismatic (Clara Oswald... zzzz). The stories, like OP said, are just weird and uninteresting. The humour is cringeworthy (Fezes are cool.... ????). Steven Moffat should leave and let a proper sci-fi writer take his place. I know it's sort of written for ""all the family"" (which means kids), but so was the Classic Series and I can watch a Fourth Doctor episode any day of the week. The 50th anniversary special was cringeworthy - I can't explain it but the dialogue is just so bland and safe - no bite to it. For example, the Timelords in that story - when he says something like ""oh look 3 of them, just my luck"" - that's why I don't watch the show. Not even funny, and they do it all the time.

&gt;  leading many people to be homeless

According to [government statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/rough-sleeping-in-england-autumn-2013):

&gt; The Autumn 2013 total of rough sleeping counts and estimates in England was 2,414. [estimates from single night snapshots]

And, according to the [Crisis website](http://www.crisis.org.uk/pages/causes-consequences.html)

&gt; Crisis research[1] looking at people's turning points into homelessness in the UK,  found that reasons most often cited by male participants were relationship breakdown, substance misuse, and leaving an institution (prison, care, hospital etc.). For homeless women,  the most common causes were physical or mental health problems and escaping a violent relationship.

While homelessness is still a problem, with such low numbers, and Crisis not listing economic factors as a main reason for homelessness, I would not say that immigration is contributing to homelessness. It may contribute towards the rising prices of houses, but I think that has much more to do with the government helping build this housing bubble, as well as major foreign investors and buy-to-let people buying up houses, factors which people against immigration like Farage ignore. 

&gt; a net gain of of 300,000 people each year is a lot.

Net gain of 200,000, not all of whom are taking jobs, or homes, and some of which (79,000 of the 532,000 total immigrants) are already British citizens. In comparison to the population of 65 million, and the birth rate of around 730,000 in 2012 ( [Link](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/birth-summary-tables--england-and-wales/2012/stb-births-in-england-and-wales-2012.html) ), it is not that much.

true,BritishFox,null,null,"I went to a Church school for primary. When I think back at it, we had a lot   Christianity going on but they were quite open about it all and science was proper, evolutionary science. 
We had a Protestant and Catholic priest in once a week who told stories from the bible in a fun way and we went to things like Christingle at the church and made oranges with sweets and all that sort of thing. We sang hymns and songs that weren't religious every day. 

There was one Indian family that had children at the school, they came in an introduced us to their religion and culture, we even celebrated Diwali with them each year, it was great fun.
Religious education was all encompassing as well. I didn't leave that school feeling the need to be religious what so ever and the majority of my friends who were educated at the school are now hold secular or atheist beliefs. 

I do not despise the school whatsoever, I don't think they taught me that there was one answer and the answer is some chap in the sky. I do think they taught good morals to us but that was often just being taught to be a good person and not necessarily for god. The only thing that I think made my education different to my friends who went to non-religious schools is that I just happen to know a shit ton about God, Jesus and the bible despite not caring at all and never wanting to practice religion. 

I'd be interested to hear if people went to a Church School and left feeling deeply religious because of the school. I think unless it's reinforced at home as well, certainly for me, you may just drift away from it all.


TL;DR - Went to church school, not into religion, know stuff about things.

At the same time though for the players at the top besides Torres it's worth taking more risks because they're successful more frequently.  With that in mind I thought of two more ways to quantify it:

Adjusting the M/BL by pass and take-on success % (issue with this is small samples for take-ons, need to think of a way to maybe weight the %'s, or use a different scale):

|	|Min	|BL	|M/BL|	Adj
|:---|:---|:------|:----|:--

No.

true,pharao007,null,null,"Mate, you'r going into proper direction but make more research. Read thoroughly and avoid sources prepared by clear nut people looking ONLY at one side of the fence.

I don't know all the positives and negatives either. It's sometimes too hard for an average citizen to fully understand them anyway (like whole economy stuff for example).

Things I quickly noticed you forgot about EU from positive side are: free movement BOTH ways. How many Brits retired in Spain? How many work around whole EU? How about you and your mates going for a holiday and don't even give a thought about whether you need any special visa restrictions etc. Just book a flight and get your passport, that's all! How about cheaper roaming? Do you think it's thanks to Farage? Check prices of roaming around the world with those in EU... and, hopefully this or next year roaming charges will be fully withdrawn. Small yay, especially when you check your phone bill after coming from a holiday in Greece because your mom wanted to know what exactly happened every few days (I'm older than you and still get such calls!). What about EHIC card? Bad or good thing?


Check this [site](http://www.the-eu-and-me.org.uk/). It isn't a comparison. Just tells you what EU gives you and does it in a more layman terms.


Regarding your negatives, I can't discuss all of them as simply I don't know enough details but it seems you look at it from only one certain point. The one provided by for example right wing papers.


For example:

&gt;we have to abide to all of their rules including the ones that are pure bullshit

That just doesn't sound right even by reading it. Are you sure those are bullshit? Are you sure UK has to abide everything? (pretty certain it doesn't, example - working time directive, UK's opt out option). Also, UK is part of EU, it votes on those things. Funnily, in EU parliament parties join with each other from all Europe forming new ones. They share interests so saying EU asks us to do bullshit is probably nowhere near the actual reason. Why would all other countries make up bullshit things?

The problem usually is with the perception. EU wants to have clean air in Europe (good or bad?). EU recently told UK that it isn't on a path to reach the level of some highly harming pollution and that UK doesn't even have proper plan for doing it. Guess what, Daily Mail reported it somehow like ""EU wants to give us a 100mln penalty"". Seriously, who the hell opposes clean air? Chinese don't find an issue with that. Certainly not the ones who died because of that. I sincerely doubt EU made unrealistic targets as all those targets need to be met by ALL EU countries - who shoot yourself in the foot then? UK isn't the biggest economy which produces such gases.


P.S. UKIP attacks Labour by saying in 2004 it shouldn't have opened borders to new EU migrants. UKIP doesn't mention the fact that UK was booming then, had very low unemployment and in fact needed more workforce to go ahead.

Being anti (or pro) anything, in a knee-jerk fashion, without proper evaluation of evidence, definitely seems antithetical to the scientific method.  However, there are many people who can look at a wide variety of evidence on either of those issues and come to a position which is broadly critical, but not immovably nor unreasonably so. On GM, for example, whilst the evidence on short term harm is fairly clear, as are some of the potential benefits to humankind, the longer term effects are still disputed and potentially seriously problematic, and the political consequences of allowing a small number of transnational corporations to legally control and economically manipulate the global food supply could be disastrous.  I won't go in to nuclear, but there's a similar case to be made there, particularly around economics and subsidies, as well as regarding the impact of climate change and the dangers which would arise from large numbers of nuclear installations during a period of high level social collapse, for example.

&gt;How can you be intelligent if you treat politics like a third division football team and sing anthems and follow your red flag socialism no matter what the facts and evidence?

Was it enough for Chelsea? City? United? No, you have to spend that consistently to get to the top, and carry on spending it to stay there. Unless you have Wenger apparently.

&gt;Why weren't we playing Lamela more often against lower sides? Gylfi? We have so many players at our disposal, most of them quite good. A good manager will get the best of them and make them perform.

Unless you have inside knowledge your opinion counts for nothing here.

&gt;We're going a 3-4 hour flight away at the worst. 

Flight time, add in travelling to airports etc and it adds up, home comforts of a familiar bus, sleeping at home etc etc.

&gt;The travel issue is a total myth

The body is a finly tuned instrument, especially if you are a  Premier League footballer. Sleep times being messed up counts, sitting on a plane after playing instead of being at home counts.

&gt;Arsenal did pretty well last weekend after getting beat to the ground and left with 10 men against the top club in the world.

Arsenal have a phenomenal manager and I have no explanation how he does it, but Arsenal have done this for years. Maybe it's experience.

&gt;The game is about glory, is it not? 

But the EL isn't, it's about maximizing revenue and squeezing as much TV time out of the top clubs as possible - e.g. CL teams dropping in. 

&gt;We may struggle for a few years with trying to juggle European cups

May? Few?

&gt;but we're building towards a future where competing across multiple fronts is a necessity. 

That's the dream, but name another English club that's gone from consistent EL competitors to consistent CL competitors seamlessly? 

&gt;What continental player do you think would want to come for us if we just bomb out of the EL or even the CL every year to focus on the league?

Playing our 2nd string in the EL would show we are serious about CL. It's CL or bust in this league.

&gt;how well do you think we'll fare in the CL if we don't get practice year over year in the EL? 

I think the 2 are unrelated, except for managerial experience which we can hire.

&gt;When we get in the CL what then - do we then forgo the league in favor of the CL?

We spend the extra millions on good players and raise their wages so the good players stay with us and we can build over a decade.

true,shabouwcaw,lfc99,,"I know most people would disagree, but I don't actually think I would play Rooney in a team that wasn't playing 4-4-2. Now Hodgson has been playing 4-4-2 since time began, so I don't expect anything different, but I actually think England have a core of good players that could play well if set up properly, and I don't think the Rooney role fits in that mould.

Basically, against the good teams, 4-4-2 isn't going to be sufficient, England will get outnumbered in the centre of the park by the likes of Germany and Spain and they'll get ruined. So in order to survive at the top level I think you have to at least mirror their 4-3-3 so it's not a numerical disadvantage and you've at least put yourself in a position to play football against them. (of course you could play a notionally 4-4-2 that's in reality just parking the bus against those teams, but that's not the kind of football I'd ever ask for)

So if we look at Rooney, what kind of player is he? He's not very mobile, he's got an OK burst of pace to go around people, but he's not that quick. He's also not tall. In terms of physical gifts, he's not that great, and he's also had fitness issues throughout his career. Also, on current form he's not finishing as much as Studge, so being played up the middle  as the main striker instead of Daniel doesn't make sense in my opinion. Rooney's best position is to sit between the lines, off a main striker, and either arrive late into the box and power one in, play another player through, avail of decoy runs to get a shot off, or take a ball that's been knocked down by another player and finish it. So that would be an advanced number 10 role, one with goalscoring talent. However, in the modern game, even 10s are expected to track back and do a defensive shift. Rooney doesn't *really* do that. He's not that mobile, as I said before, and he's grand in the tackle, but i wouldn't put it as one of the strengths of his game. Tbh I'd think Wilshere, ideally, or Barkley, for the future, would be a much better option in that creative role. I don't think Rooney can play as an attacking winger either, tbh, on current form I'd have Adam Johnson and Raheem Sterling on the wings. 

I think Rooney's problem is that he's not really exceptional as a striker, the team has to be built around him for him to really excel. And to be honest, he hasn't really shown up at previous international competition and there are better options than him in the positions that he could be slotted into. I wouldn't play him as a first choice option tbh. 

But watch as Roy sets up 4-4-2 with Rooney and Sturridge up front. They might have enough tricks among the two of them to make something happen, but I think it's sub-optimal. ",0,1393617928,null,0,false,0,cfr6fsh,t3_1z6wmm,t1_cfr6fsh,t3_1z6wmm,null,1432602458,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Often there are, at the risk of sounding highly politically incorrect, areas with a higher population density of black people or brown people or Eastern European etc., which are poorer and clumped together because the vast majority of those people are first- or second-generation immigrants and do not often have a lot of money with them, and it is hard for people to get out of the poverty trap.

true,upcy,null,null,"&gt; We're demonizing them and equating paedophillia to child rape in the same way as we equated homosexuality to buggery and, well, child rape. 

The whole point of paedophilia is that you have a desire to rape children.  There is no connection between homosexuality and a desire to rape children, and if by ""buggery"" you mean ""anal sex"" then lots of gay men don't like it, lots of straight people do, and it doesn't actually harm anyone anyway.

&gt; For example, I like women but I don't go around raping them. 

When you say ""I like women"" you presumably mean ""I have desires to have sex with women"", and it's perfectly possible to fulfill those desires without raping anyone.  With paedophilia, it isn't.  That's a pretty big difference.  Here's an analogy: OCD.  Some people with OCD get compulsions to do completely harmless things, while some get violent compulsions.  While in both cases the condition is serious and can be completely debilitating, we would probably be more concerned about the latter kind of compulsions, and as I understand it, people who get them generally find them particularly distressing and hard to deal with.

You have noticed that equating gay people with paedophiles is one of the most common tactics homophobes use, haven't you?  Practically every statement the Catholic Church makes about their child abuse cases does this, for example.  I don't think making this analogy is going to make anyone more sympathetic to paedophiles, but it will certainly reinforce negative views about LGBT people.",1,1393619608,null,0,false,0,cfr78my,t3_1z3f2o,t1_cfr78my,t1_cfq89yl,null,1432602910,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

The problem is that people generally aren't comfortable talking about homo-/bisexuality, which means that they often don't really compare their experiences with other people to get an idea of where they fit in, and also means that they are not likely to answer surveys honestly.  There is also a problem that words like ""gay"" and ""homosexual"" have a lot of stigma attached to them, so a surprising number of people reject those identities even if they would happily admit to meeting the definitions.  Also, some people are just deep in denial.  When it comes to paedophilia, all of these problems are far larger.

New Street is a bottle neck, there is no doubt about that.  It's possible to divert the Derby line trains into Moor Street if a spur is built at the point where the Camp Hill lines cross the Snow Hill lines. People have been talking about that for a while now, but most of the talk seems to imply that if anything does get built it will be a spur on the *other* side if the railway to allow the Camp Hill line stations to reopen. 

I'd love to have a read into the economics of what a massive station at Curzon Street would cost, what you would divert into there and how the people of Brum would see it.  The one big plus New Street does have is that it is one of the (if not *the*) most centrally located major railway stations on the network.

I think it's the intensity that exposes him at times in the first halves of games - as the old cliche goes, he hasn't got the legs anymore. Once the game settles, a player of his quality has no problem dictating tempo and taking control of the game. 

It's a lot like Scholes. Don't get me wrong, they are not similar players at all, but Stevie now does a more Scholesy role than he would have in the past. Scholes never started matches in his last couple of years because the tempo got away from him. He was so good in the last 20 though when the pressing had slowed (or even stopped), players aren't snapping at balls, and he had a little more time in a settled game. So easy for a player of that quality to come on and boss the business end of a match.

Other people who don't breed (because they don't want kids or are infertile) don't really seem to get put into that category, though.  Bi and trans people who do have kids do get put into that category.  I think you are vastly oversimplifying things.

&gt; When I see people arguing over whether homosexuality is an illness or not I can't help but think that they've missed this larger problem: there's nothing morally wrong with illnesses.

Calling something an ""illness"" or a ""disorder"" implies that it is desirable to treat it.  The attempts to ""treat"" LGBT people have caused a great deal of harm.

Also, nobody really does argue about this any more (except religious extremists and so on).  In the days when homosexuality was classified as a mental illness, the field of psychology was far more judgmental in general.  Nowadays, mental health practitioners are very careful not to label anything as a mental illness unless it demonstrably causes harm and distress.

I disagree with everything in this thread. I thought the first part of the series was the so so half.

Clara's character existed for the entire season before we really understood how she did it. And Clara's character was actually keeping up with the Doctor. She actually helped him in almost every episode and wasn't used as the distress which is what we had with Amy for the previous season.

This gives an explanation.~~

&gt; Sample surveys are used when we would like to know something about a population of individuals but asking all of them is impractical. For example we might wish to know how many people are migrating into and out of the UK each year. One way to find this out would be to ask everyone crossing the UK border about their migration intentions. However, this would be a very expensive and impractical approach. Instead a more cost effective approach is to use a sample survey.

&gt; The International Passenger Survey (IPS) interviews a sample of passengers (around 700,000-800,000 per year) passing through entry and exit points from the UK. This sample is used, amongst other things, to provide data to estimate the true number of people migrating into and out of the UK.

&gt; As with all sample surveys, the estimates produced are based on only one of a number of possible samples of passengers that could have been drawn at a given point in time. Each of these possible samples would produce an estimated number of migrants which may be different to the true value that would have been obtained if everyone passing through were interviewed.

So basically they survey 700,000-800,000 passengers a year, and extrapolate data from that.",0,1393622592,null,0,false,0,cfr8n14,t3_1z7k9g,t1_cfr8n14,t3_1z7k9g,null,1432603568,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

If you are happy for the new Scottish government to increase your taxes by however much it may cost them to cover these benefits, as well as fund a new payment for independent membership of the EU, then by all means vote 'yes' for independence.

However, I suspect that you may feel you pay enough taxes to the collective government as it stands (understandibly so) and paying more taxes to get the same standard of living you currently enjoy is probably something you might feel is unreasonable.

Whilst I agree that the Scottish people do deserve to have more control over the governing of their country, I can only ask that you reconsider the consequences of a 'yes' vote in more detail and not just for the cherry-garnished delights that Mr Salmond has used to entice you (and many other unsuspecting Scottish voters).

IMHO, from what I have gathered about Mr Salmond's seemingly over-ambitious plan, a totally independent Scottish Government is both foolhardy and irresponsible. There is a reason that a United Kingdom benefits us all, and quite simply it could be called a 'bulk discount'. Together we pay one EU membership, together our taxes pay for benefits we can all enjoy for the lowest cost possible. Whilst our taxes may not always be spent in the wisest of ways, we do enjoy luxuries of the NHS and other advantages that other, more financially stable countries have yet to implement. How can Mr Salmond raise the funding to keep these amenities going whilst offering more payouts on top? Is he intending the Scottish Government to work for free? I suspect not....

I am very sceptical of the better together claim that our taxes will rise. While it's certainly true that Scotland has more public money spent per person than the rest of the UK, this is greatly offset by the higher GDP per head in Scotland.

In regards to 'the oil' - This is something I have some degree of knowledge about due to having worked in the industry myself. While I think both sides of the argument are cherry picking the highest and lowest possible estimates for the value of oil left dependant upon their views on independence, I am inclined to believe that the figure quoted by Salmond et al is closer to the truth.
Future extraction technologies will also make previously 'depleted' wells productive again.


All this aside - many Scottish people (quite rightly in my opinion) feel cheated and ignored by the Westminster government. We are politically very distinct from England. We just don't vote tory, and to be saddled with a tory government is quite hard to swallow for a left leaning Scotland.

For example, File on Four is Radio 4's ""Flagship investigative series."" But its programs are only 38 minutes long and end up saying nothing new. Take the last few weeks: this week was about how dirty hospitals cause deaths. Is that a surprise to anyone? Last week's was about the probation service and cuts - cuts are hardly new, and I can get far more depth on this particular area by following a probation officer's blog. The week before was on flood defenses, a topic that was already in every newspaper, and again I could get more detail online than they could ever squeeze into their programme. And so it goes on.

My own interests are history and economics. Hardcore History has vastly more depth than anything they can squeeze into In Our Time, and The Bottom Line or In Business are little more than light entertainment compared with a serious economics podcast like Econtalk.

As for my fiancee, she cares about animals. But she is practical: she wants to know what animals are really like, day in, day out. She gets a much better idea from following a show like Monkey Life (following Dorset's Monkey World) where they spend many hours getting to know individual animals, rather than animal eye candy offered up by the BBC. ""Planet Earth"" for example had stunning new technology, allowing us to soar over waterfalls, follow charging wildebeest, or whatever, but  Monkey Life gives a much better idea of real day to day life with real animals. 

Entertainment is another matter. I gather from others that the BBC does better entertainment in some fields. But why should we be forced to pay for others' entertainment?

As for Lord Reith, does he receive anything more than lip service these days? The World Service just announced that it will take advertising. That says it all.

I think there is a desperate need for a publicly funded service to investigate the powerful.

true,DogBotherer,null,null,"&gt;Let's look at Robocop as I think it's a great example. I've seen the new one and it follows the same theme, but not as dark and sinister.

I'm an old man so I've only seen the original, but I'm sure it's similar...

&gt;In Robocop you have Omni Consumer Products as an extremely powerful corporation which breaks the markets, has it's finger deeply into politics and abuses people, keeping them down, exploiting them etc. But they're also inefficient, corrupt and wasteful. Spending huge sums of money on marketing, lobbying, bribes.
&gt;
&gt;That's what happens when you have corruption. If you had proper capitalism then they'd need to compete on their products, without being able to get legislation to run their way.

See, to me, what you're describing is ""proper"" capitalism  - capitalism as it's always been, albeit taken to a fairly extreme form.  The original definitions of capitalism, which was generally defined and described by its critics, was of a system of State privilege of private capital/ownership interests.  Capitalists don't compete unless they're forced to, one of the most famous even called competition ""a sin"", if you recall, and they'll always use the State to avoid it.

I fear that you're following a well-trodden path, encouraged by modern spinners on the right, of conflating capitalism with ""free markets"", whereas capitalism has little to do with markets, free or otherwise. Capitalism is a system of ownership, markets are about trade. Trade and markets have existed for thousands of years, capitalism has only existed for a mere few hundred. In fact, many would argue that ""free market capitalism"" is an oxymoron, because capitalism, in practice, is essentially about unfree markets. But anyway, there are anti-capitalists who support the existence of markets (and free markets) - in fact I'm one, we're called market socialists, mutualists (and other less flattering names, I'm sure); and there are anti-capitalists who oppose markets - collectivists, communists and so on.

Don't disagree with much in your next two paras, although again, I'd just call that capitalism in practice.  On the last though, I'm an anarchist, which makes me a revolutionary, but I'm a mutualist rather than a nihilist which makes me more of a builder than a destroyer, although I accept that sometimes the former requires the latter.  Revolutions do have costs, I acknowledge, though conservatives always focus on the gore sprayed around during the brief but bloody revolution whilst being completely oblivious to the gaping wounds which ooze blood throughout their preferred continuous history.",0,1393626336,null,0,1393664952,0,cfracd9,t3_1z6kbr,t1_cfracd9,t1_cfr9jtq,null,1432604371,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,NamesEvad,null,null,"I have a good theory on why people were unhappy in regards to the ""something that ties things together"" 

The way Moffat writes doesn't always feel very ""in the moment"" it focuses on the mystery with almost all of the episodes being linked to a the plots resolution. The over the top shots of the cracks, the Doctor talking to himself about the mysteries. Even the locations he goes to is often just to find something out only to accidentally come across some occurring event. It all was leading somewhere.

The problem with this is where it lead to. You see it was all revealed over the course of a minute or two as exposition for the direct episode. Even that didn't feel like much. See it all lead up to Trensalore. In the context of the show it was the Doctors death, however nothing happened. The doctor didnt die. Not that he would of course. But everything during Matt smiths time has in some way or another been leading up to Doctors death (be it from an astronaught or daleks or the destruction of his Tardis) We as an audiance knew hoever that the doctor wouldnt die, this itself destroyed all suspense in many episodes.

While I am at it Moffat went on a rampage against mystery. Sure he likes suspense and plot related mystery. But he apparently hates the mystery of The Doctor. You see the Doctor is/has been a character that you never truly know. He is a genious, he is crazy, he has done bad things. He has a grandaughter and a past that we do not know the details of. However Moffat has undermined all of that. He made everycharactor know the Doctor better then himself. Amy, River even Clara supposdely understand the Doctor more then he does. They constantly undermine his intelligence and mystery. It doesn't end there. The dark side of the Doctor was retconned in the 50th special. He is no longer the Hero with a dark past, he is now just the hero. Sure he is old, but wait, we have just spent 900 years of him trapped on a planet doing nothing, having no new experiences, learning nothing. The fact that we were able to see him for this long, so helpless undermines the brilliance that is the character. 

""But he wasn't able to leave"" you might say. Well that may be true but look how much earth advanced in 900 years. Look at how fast the Ood advanced with a little help. He had the inteligence, he had the technology, he could have changed that plannet for the better and gone on his way. He could (being the doctor) have fixed that problem in a day or two if he put his mind to it. He had the whole tardis at his disposal (300 years in) So why not use the tech inside that? why not? Becuase Moffat didnt want it. Because Moffat wanted to make this Doctor weak, he wanted to undermine and glorify his death. Because Moffat doesnt really understand what makes/made/couldmake the Doctor a great charactor.

""but there is still mystery, we dont know his name!"" THAT IS NOT MYSTERY! Look at it like this. Say the doctors name is ""Dave"" Oh.. okay the Doctors name is dave. Great. It does nothing. What if the doctors name was some massive twist that changes everything? Such a thing would be hugely divisive and would probably split the fan base further and undermine even more of the character. It is a non point. An empty box. Used as a Mcguffin to push the plot further and  is a distraction from plot and content. 

So after undermining and changing the history of the character the last few years have built up to the anti climax of the Doctor wasting time for an anti-mystery that could be resolved in minutes if he was the doctor that we know. 

TL;DR Moffat doesn't understand the Doctor. ",0,1393628266,null,0,false,0,cfrb6mz,t3_1z6vei,t1_cfrb6mz,t1_cfr8jzy,null,1432604767,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

I did not mean to offend, but I am sorry if I didn't express my point clearly.

However, we do live in a democracy, and so whilst it may seem that your leftist country is being ruled by a centre-right government, the vote to award power to the current government can be attributed to Scottish registered voters just as much as English or Welsh registered voters... In fact, so many left-wing voters made their voice heard in the last general election that we ended up with a coalition of Liberals and Tories, awarding the Lib Dems more power than they knew what to do with (hence their apparent puppetry).

One thing is for sure, the UK political situation has become a huge power-struggle between the devil you know, and the devil you don't. It is understandable why people feel inclined not to vote - what is the point when none of them are worth voting for?

I don't care how many United, Arsenal, Spurs, Everton etc fans come to r/liverpoolfc, or how many of them comment on Liverpool match threads in /r/soccer, just be bloody respectful. Same goes for us when we go to other subs (like me in this one). Banter is fine. Just wish people would fucking grow up.

I actually missed the match thread but in the last hour or two I've gone back and taken a look at it. I can see what OP means, some of our fans there were complete idiots. I tried keeping track of who made those sorts of comments, and 90% of the anti-Spurs comments from Liverpool supporters came from just about 3 or 4 Liverpool supporters. Of those 3-4, I'd only ever heard of 1 of them before (and I'm always downvoting him for being an idiot). The rest of them I'd never heard of before, so I'd hazard a guess that it was a very vocal minority of our fans who were just being idiots. I really think they were just stupid trolls.

As I said, our sub has over 14,000 subscribers. In any sub of that size there will be complete morons. That's why I said in my previous comment above that OP really shouldn't tar us all with the same brush, although I don't blame him at all for doing so. In actual fact, when we have discussed Spurs over at /r/liverpoolfc, the general consensus is that we **wanted** Spurs to get through to the next round. Obviously we want to finish above you in the league, but your European run has no bearing on us whatsoever. Same goes on other forums I'm a part of, like RAWK. I'd say about 95% of contributors there wanted Spurs to go through last night as well. Unfortunately, that vocal minority of buffoons makes themselves heard and suddenly there's this entire fabricated hatred between the two clubs.

true,Leonichol,null,null,"Using the Hali CC is fine and will definitely be better than using your actual Debit card. The Halifax Clarity card does not charge a transaction fee for cash withdrawals abroad, but the interest can be steep. As blondie says, just pay it off quickly (roughly £1 a month for every £100 withdrawn).

The other cheapest option is to use a FairFX Euro Credit Card, or if you're savvy enough in a popular place, localbitcoins. The FairFX card will charge you 1.5€ per ATM withdrawal so it is best to get as much as you will need in one go.

When using either card, if the ATM gives you a choice, remember to be charged in Euros rather than GBP.

As for cash, I believe the cheapest method is FairFX, although if you are only getting a small amount the special delivery fee can eat into the savings here considerably.
