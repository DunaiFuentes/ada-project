Some have said play him on a flank like we did with Kuyt, and sure Borini might have similar industry but I don't think he's got the physique or endurance to overcome his technical deficiencies on the flank either.

Balotelli's shown a lot more in a red shirt with just glimpses, in my opinion. The problem is it looks like a lot of his strengths don't lie with our strengths in attack - he seems a bit out of place, in my opinion.

For that reason I agree with you, he wasn't the best fit for us and probably wasn't the best option for us to go for. But for his flaws, we did end up with him and it's now up to Rodgers to find a way to fit him into the team. He's got a lot of upside if we can get things working - I think he doesn't work well as a lone striker for us and he's too similar to Lamella to work with him up top.

When he's out of form and doing nothing, as he's so prone to do, we have these lethargic and poor performances.

A team is not at its full strength when the 11 aren't working at their best and although other teams occasionally have a player out of form or carrying an injury, it so happens that our most important player who we are dependent on can't be arsed to do anything. 

I feel for him, because losing a brother is terrible and I definitely see why he's playing poorly, however the club is bigger than Yaya and we have to be ready to drop him and change our formation if we are to play as we should. Juventus suffered playing 3 at the back last season, we are suffering playing 4-4-2 with a dead weight in the middle this season.

It's not like we're lacking in the central midfield. Lampard and Milner are in amazing form and Fernando will play an extremely important role once he returns.

He's great at causing disorder and chaos for the opposition in midfield because he has a bit more license to harass and harry them where the threat to goal isn't so immediate. He is confident in his reading of the game there and so makes a good deal of tackles and interceptions. He struggles at times when he is thrust into situations where he has to play more patiently and in a more organized fashion such as when we're bunkered in. There, he tends to switch between the extremes of being too overzealous and too indecisive. When he's overzealous he chases the ball or follows an inconsequential run that is only designed to draw him out and he falls for it. When he's indecisive, he's on his heels, he sits off the ball and fails to step or he idly watches a dangerous runner go by unmolested and unmarked all because he seemingly isn't certain of what the right move is. Overall I think his issues tend to be more psychological rather than issues with his ability. With a bit of that help and some balance/footwork training for his being on his heels problem, I think he could become even better. Again though, he did have these issues from his time in Ligue 1.

Yes, you're missing something.  Bare with me...this will be long and there will be math involved.

There are 100 billion stars in the milky way galaxy alone.  Astronomers estimate that there are 100 to 200 billion galaxies in the universe.   If a time lord spent an hour at each sun looking around to see if there are planets around(and visiting said planets if there were any), and assuming he never slept and just did that 24 hours per day every day in the 2000 years that the doctor has been around he could literally only have visited 17,520,000 solar systems or 1/100th of 1% of the entire galaxy.  So basically, it would take 10,000 time lords their whole lives to visit the entirety of 1 galaxy for 1 hour.  

So to visit the other 100 to 200 billion galaxies, you would need another 1 to 2 quadrillion Time Lords to spend their whole lives visiting these systems...just for them to cover the entire space of 1 hour.

Now lets add time travel into the mix.  The universe has been around for 13 billion years.  How many hours in that 13 billion? 113 trillion+ hours and thats only counting up until today.  

So not counting the future and assuming there are a massive 2 quadrillion Time Lords that have ever existed, the chances of them running into each would be 113 trillion to 1.

We havent even added the future years of the universe to that...will the universe end tommorrow...another 10 billion years?  100 billion?  All those hours man....all those hours and the odds just keep getting lower that 2 time lords would ever run into each other.",0,1412132500,null,0,false,0,ckx53s1,t3_2hx55y,t1_ckx53s1,t3_2hx55y,null,1426742849,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

In the afternoon if you head to Barfusserplatz in the centre of town, almost all trams go through it, and it's within walking distance of anywhere in the city, you are 1 minute from Pickwicks, and 5 from Paddys. Both are down the pedestrianised wide high street, Pickwicks on the left, Paddys right at the end on the left.

Edit: for anyone arriving today, some handy travel tips:

1. Your hotel invoice or booking (if you have one) allows you to get on the bus for the airport to town for free. When you get to your hotel they will give you an unlimited public transport ticket for any days of your stay.

2. The bus from the airport is bus 50, and it leaves right outside the arrivals area of the airport. Use the green ticket machine to buy a 2 zone ticket, which covers all bus and tram travel in the direction of away from the airport, for 4 hours. There is an ENGLISH button in the green ticket machines. It is easy.

3. Barfusserplatz is the main tram stop and area In The city for Central bars and stuff. Pickwicks and Paddy Reillys are the English/Irish bars and I guess they will be the busiest.

4. From Barfusserplatz, you need tram 14 (in direction Pratteln) which will take you to the stadium at stop St. Jakob. The tram gets crazy busy before footy, so feel free to leave there a bit early. There are plenty of stalls outside the stadium to get beers and food, so don't worry about having to wait around. There are loads of trams put on after the game so don't worry about getting back into the city.",0,1412148607,null,0,1412154915,0,ckxak6v,t3_2hysn0,t1_ckxak6v,t3_2hysn0,null,1426740235,44,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,44

To Bayham's mouldering walls?

 That stand around St. Paul's.

 See you the dimpled track that runs

 All hollow through the wheat?

 O that was where they hauled the guns

 That smote King Philip's fleet.

Out of the Weald, the secret Weald,

Men sent in ancient years,

The horse-shoes red at Flodden Field,

The arrows at Poitiers!

See you our little mill that clacks,

So busy by the brook?

She has ground her corn and paid her

Ever since Domesday Book.

See you our stilly woods of oak,

And the dread ditch beside?

O that was where the Saxons broke

On the day that Harold died.

See you the windy levels spread

About the gates of Rye?

O that was where the Northmen fled,

When Alfred's ships came by.

See you our pastures wide and lone,

Where the red oxen browse?

O there was a City thronged and known,

Ere London boasted a house.

And see you  after rain, the trace

Of mound and ditch and wall? 

O that was a Legion's camping-place,

When Caesar sailed from Gaul.

And see you marks that show and fade,

Like shadows on the Downs?

O they are the lines the Flint Men made,

To guard their wondrous towns.

Trackway and Camp and City lost,

Salt Marsh where now is corn;

Old Wars, old Peace, old Arts that cease,

And so was England born!

She is not any common Earth,

Water or wood or air,

But Merlin's Isle of Gramarye,

Where you and I will fare!

Foodbanks provide food for anyone that applies, so the only ""needs"" criteria that come in here is your willingness to put pride aside, which obviously varies enormously from person to person. The reality is that even after the recession these people have far higher incomes than my parents did in post-war Britain. They never considered themselves in poverty and made a lot better economic decisions than many of these people.

Benefit delays are something I'm much more sympathetic towards, but that's a matter of government competence rather than the value of benefits. 

&gt; the vast, vast majority are in fact 'working hard families'

Firstly, do you have evidence for that? I accept that the majority probably work, albeit not the ""vast, vast majority"", but my experience working in retail has found that a lot of the people technically in work aren't ""hard working"" at all, attempting to get by with the bare minimum.

They vary a lot between different houses... for example I used to live next to several large fishing lakes.

The place I live now is 4 stories up a new apartment building and I've only ever seen one small one in here over nearly 2 years, in the bathtub on the day I moved in (probably just because the house hadn't been occupied for a month).

Anyway, your best bet is to make your house as spider-unfriendly as possible... so try to avoid it getting damp, kill any flies that get in and leave the windows closed as much as possible. Also, cruel as it sounds, I just kill them when I see them - otherwise they'll breed and you'll never get rid of them.

Nastasic can't play the way Pellegrini wants him too unfortunately. Its a square peg in round hole situation. He should be playing cup games though, and at least given a chance to show if he can.

Mangala just arrived and played badly on the weekend, so he didn't earn Pellegrini's trust to start a vital game.


Scott Sinclair is not good enough. He couldn't get into the WBA bench last year, he certainly isn't going to displace Milner or Navas who are both more likely to score - in fact Navas scored more goals last year than Sinclair has in the top flight his whole career.

We need another goal threat, I agree with you. But Jovetic is back, and is a much better option for a wide attacking player behind the strikers.

For Chavs I'd recommend council housing estates in medium sized cities or towns. Bristol or Gloucester might be a good place to start. For pikeys just read the news and you'll see where they are but any area that has pleasant open areas of grass is likely to be attractive to them.

Last season was a write-off for him. He spent three or four months settling down and the rest injured. So far this season he's looked much better, but still way way off a £30m player. Because of all the goodwill he's generated, everyone whoops and cheers every time he does anything, but so far in six Premier League games he's got 0 goals and 3 assists. He looks ok. If he were a young, untried player we'd spent £12m on then that would be fine, but we bought him for £30m as one of the best young players in the game. £30m should not buy you potential. £30m should buy you a player who is ready to take the league by storm.

Radioactive material is also extremely difficult to get hold of, let alone handle. Dirty bombs have yet to be used, they are not a credible threat. 

This article sums up the overly hyped nature of dirty bombs and their ineffectiveness:
http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100421_dirty_bombs_revisited_combating_hype#axzz3EsswH5S8

While there are many good paragraphs talking about the futility of using them, these two explain it best:

&gt;In December 1998, the pro-Russian Chechen Security Service announced it had found a dirty bomb consisting of a land mine combined with radioactive materials next to a railway line frequently used to transport Russian troops. It is believed that Chechen militants planted the device. In September 1999, two Chechen militants who attempted to steal highly radioactive materials from a chemical plant in Grozny were incapacitated after carrying the container for only a few minutes each; one reportedly died. This highlights another difficulty with producing a really effective dirty bomb: The strongest radioactive material is dangerous to handle, and even a suicide operative might not be able to move and employ it before being overtaken by its effects.

&gt;Still, none of these Chechen incidents really provided a very good example of what a dirty bomb detonation would actually look like. To do this, we need to look at incidents where radiological isotopes were dispersed by accident. In 1987, in Goiania, Brazil, a tiny radiotherapy capsule of cesium chloride salt was accidentally broken open after being salvaged from a radiation therapy machine left at an abandoned health care facility. Over the course of 15 days, the capsule containing the radioisotope was handled by a number of people who were fascinated by the faint blue glow it gave off. Some victims reportedly even smeared the substance on their bodies. The radiation was then dispersed by these people to various parts of the surrounding neighborhood, and some of it was even taken to nearby towns. In all, more than 1,000 people were contaminated during the incident and some 244 were found to have significant radioactive material in or on their bodies. Still, only four people died from the incident, and most of those who died had sustained exposure to the contamination. In addition to the human toll, the cleanup operation in Goiania cost more than $100 million, as many houses had to be razed and substantial quantities of contaminated soil had to be removed from the area.

You have to expect the simplistic analysis. Most people on this sub-reddit have done their own reading. I've done a massive amount of reading and watching just through my own interest in history, but you wouldn't be able to say the same about the general population, so the BBC are giving this a lot of coverage.

As for the winner, there was no winner. I see the point he is trying to make, Republicans, Loyalists and the British could all see themselves as having lost in some way. Republicns conceded that NI is going no where without self-determination, Loyalists conceded that nationalists will never be second class citizens again and that it is not ""their"" country, and the British conceded that they could not beat the IRA militarily, they were (whether people like it or not) a well trained military outfit, remembering that Britain is one of the most powerful nations in the world.

2 - Best mates with 11 and chat about bow-ties and Scottish folk. Feverishly wants to show him how to play the recorder.

5 - Feels bad about 12, all that self doubt and everything. Sits him down and says he's a good man. Likes 10 (as in Time Crash) but also quite likes 9. Thinks 9 can get stuff done that maybe he can't.

6 - Really thinks he's better than everyone, but gets along best with 1 and 7. They're having the really big chats about time, causality, ethics that 4 understands but finds a bit boring.

7 - Has a soft spot for 2. Totally jealous of 3. He's so tall and action-packed. God, he wishes he was 3.

8 - 8 and 10 are total lads together and this weirds 11 out. They poke fun at 5, but like him really.

War - War doesn't enjoy anything anymore and is only here because something went drastically wrong with the fabric of reality. He's trying to fix it asap.

9 - I figure 9 quite likes 6. Kind of guys that sound like they're having an argument even when they agree on something.

10 - Wants to play cricket with 5 but they'd need everyone to play and some incarnations aren't having any of that nonsense.

11 - He takes like half of 4's jelly babies and wants to talk with 1 a lot. 11 was quite reflective on his life as a whole, but 1 can't deal with the silly way he refers to things.

false,joethepro36,null,null,"To say I changed my political direction on a single bad experience is a joke, takes a little more than that to a lifelong labour voter. I have had many bad experiences with recent immigrants into the UK, with my housemates and with others. The second and third generations are British cultured and good people all round, generally speaking. I've since moved to a house with British guys and there has been not so much as an unkind word towards me. If anything my only criticism is they're too quiet!

I take issue with the negative cultural differences around me. It is only when you are actually living with people from other cultures you begin to both appreciate and dislike elements from their cultures. Often those so embracing of the multicultural attitudes have never even lived with other cultures, they just have wishful thinking from afar. Multiple cultures in a house do not get along in my experience, they cooperate in some areas and directly conflict in others. Have you ever lived with recent immigrants to the UK yourself?

Perhaps I should go into more detail on why I've grown so disillusioned with labour? Firstly, their distinct lack of real policy except opposition for opposition's sake has grown tiresome. Where do they stand? Apparently for almost the same principles as the conservatives. They promise similar things and deliver similar things. The labour vision of class struggle and rallying against the tories painted my childhood through the '90's. I was there at the rallies and the demonstrations, even when a child. Where is that vision now? Gone to be replaced by middle and upper class twats who no nothing of the ordinary working man but seek to tell the working man how to think and how to feel. Out of touch is an understatement.

My initial slide towards UKIP back in 2010 was due to complete disillusionment with all three political parties. Why vote for someone towing the same establishment line? It's vote labour and get tory lite, vote tory and get labour lite. The lib dems backing out of tuition fees forever destroyed their credibility in my eyes. I never really sided with them anyway but their apparent loyalty to students was the only hope they had in my eyes of gaining my support.

Another issue I have is the very real threat of our sovereignty being undermined. To think we have unelected officials in the EU that have power over our law in any sense, no matter how big or small is wrong in my eyes. While UKIP directly wishes to ensure that British law is made only by British, elected officials, the main three parties are quite happy for unelected officials to set laws over our land.

Labour's approach to immigration is based on the notion that if we import all cultures and throw them together they will live in peaceful cooperation. It matters not if we bring in a couple of hundred thousand unskilled or uneducated migrants a year, somehow they will function perfectly. They make no argument about assimilation, my most hated of aspects around their views. I personally think immigrants should assimilate to British culture, that our culture is to be the dominant force in the isles that spawned it. However the reality is that many, although probably not the majority of immigrants wall themselves off into their enclaves, their communities within communities. Instead of integrating with the British population, they practice their own culture and religion unfettered. Even if it teaches men that white girls are trash, whores to be abused.

On a more esoteric note I find the approach of so many labour supporters to simply name call UKIP as ""racists"" without debate or argument to be a greatly off putting remark. Don't like immigration? ""You're a racist"". Don't like the EU? ""You're a racist"". Shutting down all debate with name calling before it even starts and leaving the country open to abuses like Rotherham. Are these the people I'm supposed to be siding with? The ones shouting against the polite?! David Cameron similarly called UKIP members ""disgusting racists"", something quite rightly said as something that pushed the true blue tories over to UKIP for simply having concerns over immigration and Europe. The only common ground that I have with them.

Rotherham was the final bullet. When the left leaning types all rallied around and tried to portray it as just class struggle and misogyny I knew at that point enough was enough. No condemnation of the culture or religion that was responsible, just attempts to hand wave complex issues over in favor of the ideological line. Because anything criticizing culture or religion, ironically when neither are races, is ""racist"" and anything to not be a racist!

I'm one of those idiots who enjoys watching birds, which tends to involve lots of public footpaths, so a few years back I read up my rights and those of the landowner. As I remember it, and as a basic summary, you have a right to ""pass and repass"" along a public footpath but in such a way that doesn't impinge upon the landowner's ""reasonable enjoyment"" of the land. *I think.* So yes, if there's meant to be a footpath present, try it out. My advice is to have the relevant OS map (or a portion of) with you so you can be sure of where you are and can demonstrate your right of way if you're approached. Most people aren't looking for conflict, so it's extremely unlikely you'll have any trouble. The couple of times I have had trouble have been because of the binoculars, rather than my presence.

In a very few cases paths are deliberately made harder to use: a farmer near where we used to live took all the signs out, dug a ditch across the end where the path once met the lane, and ploughed the hedge up... but that's pretty unusual and I think illegal. Again, working on memory, landowners have a duty to maintain the path and allow passage.

One path just outside our current village is an old track that's now someone's drive. You need to buzz the entry thing on a gate so they can let you in to walk up it. I tried once and they weren't in, which was kinda shit. On another path, after crossing a field you emerge through a hedge right into the middle of a well maintained back garden. It's odd, and while you are allowed to stop on public footpaths, I think stopping in a garden might be a step too far.

I think. So yes, if there's meant to be a footpath present, try it out.

Some farmers find it much easier to ""claim"" the middle of the field for themselves (it makes much more sense to plough through the middle of the field than it does to leave a path through the middle.

At this point, it's easier to walk around the outside of the field than it is to traipse through someone's crop. I believe it is the official thing to do (walk around the edge of the field) but it's what my granddad always taught me.

&gt; You need to buzz the entry thing on a gate so they can let you in to walk up it.

I'm not convinced they're allowed to do that... because it's no longer free to use as a path. If it is of inconvenience to you, then the local council (or if you're feeling aggresive the local walking/rambling clubs) may be able to look into it for you.

As a side story, a local climbing venue has a path along the top. It's useful to climb the cliff face and leave via the path. However, the path and the top of the cliff is someone's back garden.

The previous owners of the house had put a flower bed at the end of their garden, and a small fence down the side (with a 3' border between their hedge and the fence). A polite sign asking climbers to walk around the garden, rather than through it. New owners of the house demolished the ""walkway"" and put up a sign saying ""no walking"". Poor buggers, they must have known about it when they bought the house/land. Legal things have happened between the local rambling association and the new homeowners, last time I was in the area I noticed a well trodden walkway right through their lawn (as noted on the OS map).

What will become a problem is if these abusers being welcomed and protected here on the grounds of their religion. 

In terms of everybody else's freedom to wear burkas, there's that basic problem of having a hidden identity. There is the problem of minor crimes, like lets say a hit and run, where the wearer of the burka can pretty much get away with it because there is no evidence to ID them. We have CCTV cameras all over the place, and they are there for a reason. It's not right that there is an identification exemption in these situations on the basis of religion.

You can't just give everyone a right to do anything they want on the basis of religious grounds. You must draw a line *somewhere*. I would draw it at the place where religious people are gaining exemptions from laws and protections governing the rest of society.

Yeah, do what looks like it'll cause least damage to the land. I tend to use field edges if it isn't a dozen times a longer route than it would otherwise be, or it there's no sign people regularly pass through the middle and the farmer's made no effort to spray/clear the path.

Now, 12.5% may not seem like a lot, but replicating DNA is a mammoth task. Our genome is roughly 3*10 to the 9 base pairs, and the machinery in place can replicate this in it's entirety with only one error in every 10 to the 8 base pairs. Most of these errors occur during the replication of repeated parts of DNA (the same sequence of 2/3 base pairs for what can be many thousands of times), which account for between 25% and 45% of all of our DNA.

When you leave school at 15/16 you decide if you want to carry by going to college or you start an apprenticeship. They have apprenticeships for almost any non-academic career, builder, plumper, farmer, office worker (which are then specialised depending on the company you work for, e.g. banking, insurance, importer, etc.), mechanic, retail, etc. You work for the company 2-3 days a week and the rest you go to school, where you are taught things related to your field (i.e. for me it was languages, law, book-keeping, IT, economics, typing, etc.). Apprenticeships last 3-4 years depending on your field and you are paid a small amount (I started on £150 a month in the first year and got about £400 in my third year). Companies who want to employ apprentices have to register, are limited in the number they can employ (I think as a rule they should be able to offer you a full-time job at the end) and have to follow strict rules regarding what they use you for and what they teach you, to ensure apprentices are not taken on as cheap labour. It works great. Kids get a very good education with lots of work experience. Companies get cheap labour that they then can train to their standard.

I assume apprenticeships are not as highly regulated here?

&gt;I think that's a really smug, pompous and arrogant attitude, it's fun.

&gt;You think getting educated is smug pompous and arrogant? On the drinking side - I'm not a teetotaller, I enjoy pubs clubs and festivals and drink through them all. However I don't like seeing drunk 18 year olds having their stomachs pumps, or the London Ambulance service taking 45+ mintutes to respond to calls on a Friday night.

This makes it sound like if you drink you're a moron and drunk 18 year olds only get pissed to the point of needing their stomach pumped. That isn't.

&gt;Especially when it comes to education, and not getting obliterated on Friday/Saturday night.

It's fun to get really pissed, education and drink aren't mutually exclusive, people need downtime.

&gt; The money and concern spent on anti-radicalising Muslim teenagers would be better spend on the ambulance service on the weekends.

&gt;The 'Prevent' strategy for examples costs £3 million a year, and that is one of several programs run by the UK government, let alone what the Met and local councils spend from their own budgets. Sure £3 million isn't much, but its more than 100 nurses for example.

Fair enough.

&gt;I think that's arrogant and cunty. You get fines for actual damage etc already.
&gt;Well first off why is it arrogant? I want to know why its cunty as well but I think that may be because you've taken a dislike to me.
Secondly you get fines but only up to £80 which isn't much at all. In addition its a lot of paperwork, plus drunks require a constant watch when in cells - which means every 30 minutes. Its not cost effective for the police to arrest them so there is no deterrent.

£80 isn't much at all? WHAT WORLD ARE YOU ON?

One is children who have been adopted or who are in foster care and have problems with their birth family. In those cirumstances, adoptive and foster parents will have spoken to the nursery already and reiterated how important it only for Persons A and B to collect Baby C, and probably also given a description of Birth Parents D and E in case they find the nursery and try to cause trouble.

The other group is estranged parents, often with restraining orders. Again, the parent with custody will have explained all of this to the nursery staff.

You have never been to the nursery before, but presumably your wife visited to check it out, attended the induction sessions, and has been there for pick up and drop off multiple times? The nursery know that your home situation is normal and secure. This morning at drop-off, your wife presumably said ""Oh Freq will be here at one o'clock, you'll finally get to meet him!""

Now the nursery hasn't behaved perfectly here, they should have some sign-in system, but on the grand scale of oversights, this is so minor. There is no real threat to your daughter or the other children from some random stranger walking in off the street. That is a boogeyman, it doesn't happen. One or two individual children might be at risk of abduction, but not by randomers, by estranged family.

The only stranger risk is of some kind of Dunblane or Sandy Hook event. But again, that's so rare and a photo ID sign-in system would do absolutely nothing to stop it.

(Sorry, the above paragraph wasn't to freak you out or to seem 2edgy4u, I also have a kid in nursery so I'm not intending to be glib.)

I would probably have handled this by giving the manager a confused smile and saying ""sorry, should I sign something, or show you my driver's license or something?"" and that would probably have resulted in them pulling out a dusty sign-in book, or breezily saying ""no, no, Mrs Freq told us you'd be here now!""

I would let it go otherwise, but if you really want to, you could drop your daughter off next week and say something. But the most important thing I reckon is for you to **find out what your wife thinks**.

Lets be honest here. We haven't defended anything since 1982. For one reason or another, over the last 30 years all we have done is attack people.  Mainly at the bequest of other people but we have still been the aggressors. 

Anyway, I don't however agree with the article.  The arms industry and maintaining a large well equipped military force means that indirectly the government redistributes our taxes in a way that other spending doesn't.  

If we improved our hospitals and schools with this money, you would soon reach a point where there was little value in training / employing staff or adding new resources before the budget was anywhere near spent.  We just don't have that many sick people or children to fund.

Give it to the military and they spend it, creating jobs and wealth distribution.  The article also doesn't mention that frequent wars that are necessary to show case our technology and means our arms sales get a huge boost, once again creating jobs and wealth for the country.

They don't generally have direct legislative power and existed only to rubber stamp legislation passed by local legislatures, the role was also mostly taken up by HK-Chinese representatives in later years rather than by Britons.

In a sense, by doing this they have breached the agreement between our nation and theirs, so we have every right to be critical on behalf of our former citizens.

Outbound sales (sometimes called cold or semi-cold calling) is horrific and you'll want to avoid it like the plague. What you want is incoming calls only (i.e. people who have chosen to phone up to place an order/discuss an order or have some sort of question).

The place I worked at was called a fulfillment center... basically these are call centers that handle a companies customer services operation, usually because the company is foreign and doesn't have a large enough UK operation to justify its own dedicated UK customer services. I was lucky and only worked for one client, mostly answering emails. 90% of calls were people wanting to place orders, and the remainder were people trying to book delivery slots, cancel orders or complain about orders/ask for refunds. It was fairly low stress once you got used to it. If people were rude you'd just say *""I'm sorry if you continue to speak to me like that I'm going to end this call""* whilst you simultaneously hang up. 

After 2-3 years people who seemed serious about the job were able to put themselves forwards when team leader positions became available. In the case above the company decided it was large enough to need a ""HR manager"" and one of the call center girls who'd been there a few years managed to nab it.

Unfortunately in these sorts of minimum wage office jobs you just have to accept its going to be a bit shit going through the door... but if the work is tolerable and there are distant prospects for advancement it can be worth sticking it out. This could be particularly true if you plan to do it while you are at uni, as they might be able to take you on full time when you leave. 

Alternatively try and get a call center job with a big known company - like a highstreet bank in one of their call centers (when I was at uni in Brighton there were both American Express and RBS call centers that recruited heavily from the unis).

Completely unfair on the buyer given that house prices have increased by so much that even a fairly average-sized 3 bed is costing over £250k.

There was one that kept weaving in front of the shed where I store my bike so I was having to destroy the web twice a day to get/put back my bike. Then one day, it started weaving a different shaped web that didn't go over the shed entrance. I'm honestly not making this up. That was a couple of weeks ago and I haven't had to destroy the web since.

We now coexist happily and I've enjoyed seeing him/her get bigger every day. When he/she sees me coming, they scamper from the middle of the web to under some leaves from a nearby bush.

Having the results be for the UK is fairer than just for London. As a side note, do we know how many more Muslims there are in London this year? If the number increased 65% from last year then this would give the same amount of ""hate crimes"" per capita.

The article takes a statistic for one region of the country, without giving us any other facts, like the increase in Muslim population or what is deemed a ""hate crime"".

Probably because ""Violent crimes against Muslims up 3.7% across the UK"" isn't good enough click bait.

Someone check my maths? I can't figure out where the article gets the £3200 figure from. If I am understanding this correctly:

Allowance increase from £10,500 to £12,500 means that everyone earning over £12,500 will benefit by £400 (20% of the £2000 increase in limit).

Threshold increase from £41,900 to £50,000 means that everyone earning over £50,000 will benefit by £1620 (£8100 increase in threshold, tax rate for this band reduces from 40% to 20%, so 20% of £8100 increase in net income). They will also get the extra £400 from the allowance increase. £2020 benefit if no other thresholds are changed.

&gt; The National Citizen Service is a scheme that is intended to broaden the horizons and change perspectives of young people within society. It involves residential trips for outdoor activities and creative media followed by the organisation of a charity/community event. The main emphasis being the gaining of confidence and perseverance of youth. I personally participated and found that encouragement to be thinking for yourself and being tolerant of others took p residence as the message of the entire programme. This is the only point of which I believe to be of worth from the Tories plans, as it is plainly not a ""Real"" Tory idea in relation to their core beliefs of less state intervention. This is because the programme is heavily subsidised and available for roughly £30 for 2 weeks and prolonged time in which a charity/community event is organised.

The reason it is who it is is precisely why Russia is making the move it is: there's enough of a grey area to create the uncertainty and obfuscation that gives Putin this opportunity. 

The Hong Kong situation is, of course, slightly different. Again, though, I really don't see how we're ""pledged to protect"" anyone. Realpolitik would suggest that HK, and Macau, are now Chinese.

Though those other professions generally have higher barriers to entry.

Remember that teaching has a surplus of trainee teachers and NQTs so it can't be that bad if record numbers are trying to break into the profession.

Taxing revenue?  Very tricky as lots of firms make very little profit in low margin high revenue areas.

To me it's important to think of the system that you are trying to have, companies are owned by someone ultimately.

There are two separate issues here: Borrowing money to pay for education, and using loan money to go drinking.

What I will say is that if you really want a degree, you could spend 15 years earning enough money to sustain yourself through it. Or you could get a student loan, and get a decent, higher paying job and pay back your student loan in just 10 years.

If your friends want to go drinking on loan money, then that is absolutely their right too. Even if they think ""It's okay, I'll never pay it back anyway"", well great, if you don't want to aim high in life and never earn over £21,000 then that's fine, don't let me stop you. Just don't claim state benefits from the people who do. 

I didn't have a good home life and I was desperate to get away from my parents, so £6k/y sounded like an absolute bargain. There are also many life lessons you do learn from starting out on your own, including paying bills, rent, dealing with estate agents, and learning to live with people who are generally disgusting/stupid/unhygienic/messy etc, and these skills are not to be sniffed at.

I think you misunderstand. That is exactly my point. Hence, your argument that preventing the wearing of burkas protects vulnerable people is completely and utterly flawed.

&gt; What will happen is the abusers will think twice about bringing their women over here.

I call bullshit.

1. There are already people in the UK who wear burkas. If any of them do so under duress, this measure will not help them.

2. Abusers *love* it if the people they abuse are unable to go outside safely. It makes abusing *so much easier*. They aren't going to be put off coming here by any hypothetical law banning the wearing of burkas in public, even if they know about it. In fact, the argument could be made that ultra-traditional muslims are *more likely* to want to come over here, because 'good muslim women' (in their eyes, the ones who wear burkas) aren't allowed outside. Sound like an ultra-traditional religious society to you? Because it does to me.

&gt; What will become a problem is if these abusers being welcomed and protected here on the grounds of their religion. 

I also call bullshit on the idea that abusers are protected on the grounds of their religion. Much (all?) of what constitutes abuse is illegal, and there is no 'unless you are a Muslim' exception.

&gt;  there's that basic problem of having a hidden identity. There is the problem of minor crimes, like lets say a hit and run, where the wearer of the burka can pretty much get away with it because there is no evidence to ID them

I mean, in the UK *I* live in, there's something called a number plate which makes anyone involved in a hit and run fairly easy to identify. But what do I know? (And if you want to forbid people from wearing whatever they want in a private vehicle that they own, that's a really dangerous precedent to be setting...)

Aside from the fact that's a really bad example, the number of crimes committed by burka wearers is certainly less than the number of crimes committed by people wearing motorcycle helmets, or balaclavas, or masks, to hide their faces. Unless you can come up with any credible evidence that banning burkas would lead to an increase in public safety, I'm not convinced.

(And, you know, the #1 characteristic you can use to identify criminals rather than people following the law is that criminals *don't follow the law*. Forbidding face-covering masks is not going to prevent criminals from wearing face covering masks.)

&gt; We have CCTV cameras all over the place, and they are there for a reason. 

Personally, I believe we have far too many CCTV cameras, so I'm not likely to be convinced here...

&gt; Political correctness is nice, but you have to realize that at some point being overly politically correct is dangerous. 

This isn't about political correctness. This is about not arbitarily limiting civil liberties for literally no gain. 

&gt; You can't just give everyone a right to do anything they want on the basis of religious grounds.

Well, no, but you equally shouldn't introduce laws to limit people's freedoms on the basis of thinly veiled islamophobia.

That same day, construction began in Portsmouth of the 6,000-tonne Lower Block 2 for Queen Elizabeth.

Travelling 600 miles (970 km) around the northern coast of Scotland, the block arrived at Rosyth on the evening of 20 August 2011.

I'm not sure I can agree about not paying it back being okay. I think the system works fine, but I believe the principal of it is that if you can't pay it back, something's gone wrong. Maybe your field has stopped employing as many, or maybe some goalposts changed. Either way, doesn't matter, you're not going to have someone pounding at your parents' door coming to take your laptop, bed and 5 books away. If you're going in with no intentions of paying it back, it strikes me as dishonest or an abuse of the system. That's not to say that the system is broken or that these people should be somehow punished, but it's just not the right attitude.

You make a good point there, I know people with parents I'd be glad to pay that much money to get away from! And while I get that it teaches you life lessons and can be a good experience, I just couldn't bring myself to do that unless I had do, because it's not my money to spend. I don't actually have it, so I shouldn't be spending it unless I need to. When I think about how many hours of work I've done to build up a few thousand, throwing that much at away on something I don't need feels like I'm cheating myself! Not to mention, for that money I could get equipment that would bring me a lot more long term use and enjoyment.

I know that there's no right answer here, I just wanted peoples' opinions on the subject. It's just one of those things I never considered people would have a different opinion on, and when I found out I seemed to be in a minority,  I wanted to find out what a broader number of people thought. I don't want to change anyone's mind here, apart from perhaps my own.

There is very much an ""old boys club"" in FET, where lecturers band together and are very lazy and very unwilling to help students. There is clear favoritism and little or no democratic process to escalate any issues. Senior staff will not further issues you have for fear of pissing off their colleagues or friends, and it is very difficult to get anywhere when you feel you or your fellow students have been done a wrong.

Those lecturers that *do* care and *will* help you are very few and far between. There seems to be an ethos in FET/CSCT of keeping old boys in the job and not upsetting the applecart. I can name at least a dozen names that fit this description, and almost caused me and several dozen of my fellow students to fail modules because they were lazy, incompetent or both.

I do not think Islamic culture on a whole is something that I would like in Britain, I do not like seeing or hearing some of the things I do on the street that are directly related to Islam. The culture to me seems backward, anti-intellectual, sexist, homophobic, etc.

It's like Britain has done so well over coming christian zealots these last few years, where the church of England is now really quite open minded and is not trying to argue about science and cultural issues every 5 minutes and shoving god down everyones neck. Sure religion is still in a lot of primary schools but it's not as bad as it was.

But now I'm seeing things that are far worse and it's pretty much all coming from muslims, there are ghetto's not set up by a fascist government but through choice. Areas where sexism, corruption and crime run unchecked and un-reported because it's accepted by that community. Those area have taken a massive step back in time.

I don't have anyway of dealing with this issue, but I know there are lots of ""normal"" muslims. Muslims who are not zealots, not racist, not sexist and not fucking insane. While they are still religious I see no difference between them and a C of E christian, both believe in their own god and both are productive members of society.

British Muslims more likely to say that removing headscarves and veils is less necessary for integration than the general public, but they also say the same of the turban, large crosses and Yarmulkes.  They also have far more trust in our justice system and courts than the rest of us do.

If a bank allows you to add the stamp duty to the mortgage, then doesn't that affect the LTV? So if I have 25% deposit, if the bank add another 8k to the mortgage, then technically I might then only have 15%, which would probably screw me over with the interest rate I'd receive.

This is not a good thing; the purpose of constitutional laws is to limit the power of governments - in practice it places the power of what it is and isn't legal for a government to do into the hands of a judicial system. The independence of a judiciary is a matter for debate, but I trust our own government has less influence on the judiciary in Europe than here in the UK. In this sense, I would argue that their ruling is more likely to be impartial and will interpret the European human rights as it is written.

The other option is that they don't agree with the European convention of human rights, which we have been signed up to since 1950. I beg anyone to actually[ read the damn thing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Convention_on_Human_Rights) before going all UKIP Meltdown on it.
It isn't something that can never change, that is set in stone.

Then, we ask if the judges in Strasboug are a) *qualified* and b) *judicially independent*. 

Part a) is important and a legitimate criticism of the court is that the judges do not have a good enough background - this isn't a reason for abandoning the court though I wouldn't argue we should completely scrap magistrate courts because the magistrates are just jumped up ex-headteacher types with a fetish for power, no legal expertise, and involvement in other people's lives; I'd say reform the process for the selection of magistrates (or election). 

Part b, though, is really important. This is the bit I can't get my head around in Cameron/Farage's case because they don't really have an answer. It's reactionary hyperbole to highest degree. In my mind, they are far less vulnerable to interference than the British high court because government has minimal say in the selection of judges. If a judge in the British high court (i.e. a powerful member of the British establishment) makes the *wrong* ruling it will probably hurt their future career or social standing; something a lot less likely to happen in a European court.

Look, I'm not talking about how we'd like the world to be. In an ideal world, regimes like China wouldn't exist. Nor would the Conservative party or, for that matter, Tony Blair. I'm talking about the reality of the handover we negotiated for our former colony. Do you know how we ""got"" Hong Kong in the first place, by the way? 

What I still don't understand is what you expect to happen here. Yes, let's huff and puff and say it's unacceptable. Yes, let's wave placards and sign petitions and etc etc ad nauseam. Let's do all the things we usually do when China does something naughty. 

But your overriding argument - let's not make promises we don't keep - does, I think, show a fundamental misunderstanding about the nature of the HK handover in particular and our foreign policy in general. In the grand scheme of things, actually, we're far from being the worst offenders. But the truth is that countries like China and Russia, to take two obvious examples, are less concerned about their image in the international community - except, perhaps, as regards the business community - than we are.

It's actually quite complicated. Connexions used to have ring fenced funding. The first round of coalition cuts removed the ring fence so that local authorities could choose whether or not to fund Connexions. Some did, most didn't. So there are remnants of the Connexions service in some areas.

The National Careers Service is broader than Connexions and runs parallel to it. Anyone in the country can use the National Careers Service, just phone up the call centre and they book you an appointment with your nearest adviser. Alternatively you can get careers advice over the phone. There's also live online chat for young people.

Imo both Connexions (what's left of it) and National Careers Service are great so feel free to use either or both.

As far as apprentices go we're very aware of them. However we are mostly customer-led. So if you come in and ask an adviser about a degree we won't always look at alternative routes to get to your career. That may be less than ideal if what you want to do is be, say, a firefighter and you come in and ask us about a firefighting degree.(We should truth be told, but we're human and if someone comes in and asks about something we won't always think to say ""did you know you could do it a different way""). Your adviser might point out there's other ways to become a firefighter than doing a degree and the website has profession profiles that include a section on entry requirements for your chosen career. https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/Firefighter.aspx

On the whole my experience as an adviser is that we can really help people. One customer even said to me ""I think God must have sent you to help me!"" which was very sweet. She was in a difficult situation wanting to study to develop her career while also working full time and being a single parent. We had a good discussion and I was able to draw her attention to some options she didn't know about for distance learning and student finance. She left the interview feeling very optimistic.

Sorry for the slight tangent, not to take away from Toni Pearce's article which I largely agree with, just wanted to point out that there is careers advice available if anyone wants it.",0,1412179434,null,0,1412179745,0,ckxjetp,t3_2hz753,t1_ckxjetp,t1_ckxgqp9,null,1426735929,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The European Convention on Human Rights was intended to enshrine the [UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/history.shtml) in law for Europe. The UN UDHR was passed by the UN General Assembly in December 1948 as a response to the horrors of the second world war.

In no small part, the ECHR was pushed for by a fellow called [Winston Churchill](http://www.churchill-society-london.org.uk/WSCHague.html), who said:

""In the centre of our movement stands the idea of a Charter of Human Rights, guarded by freedom and sustained by law. It is impossible to separate economics and defence from the general political structure. Mutual aid in the economic field and joint military defence must inevitably be accompanied step by step with a parallel policy of closer political unity. It is said with truth that this involves some sacrifice or merger of national sovereignty. But it is also possible and not less agreeable to regard it as the gradual assumption by all the nations concerned of that larger sovereignty which can alone protect their diverse and distinctive customs and characteristics and their national traditions all of which under totalitarian systems, whether Nazi, Fascist, or Communist, would certainly be blotted out for ever.""

So. Call-me-Dave wants to take a fire axe to a piece of legislation enshrining in UK law a chunk of supranational legislation put in place by notable former Conservative prime minister *Winston Churchill* as an anti-totalitarian measure.

Coinciding with Theresa May's attempt at reintroducing a universal surveillance regime of which the Stasi or KGB would have been proud, and her avowed desire to [gag unpalatable political views from the media](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/sep/30/theresa-may-ban-extremists-television),  you've got to wonder where all this is intended to go ...

Intro...
&gt; Thank you,

&gt; Thank you,

&gt; We've been recording the music video,

&gt; And it goes like this...


Verse 1:
&gt; I'm hardcore and I know the score,

&gt; And I am disgusted by the poor,

&gt; And my chums matter more,

&gt; Because we are the law,

&gt; And I've made sure,

&gt; We're ready for class war,

&gt; Taking money from the man who works long hours,

&gt; Giving power to the tycoons in glass towers,

&gt; That is why I can look you in the eye,

&gt; And tell you...

Chorus 1:
&gt; This is the party of the mother fuckers,

&gt; We don't care about the mother suckers,

&gt; Because this is the party of the mother fuckers,

&gt; And no I don't think that's a dirty word,

&gt; So let the beat drop...

Verse 2: 
&gt; I come here with flows right from the top,

&gt; Everybody knows if you work in a shop,

&gt; We won't help you, and do you know what,

&gt; People rising from the bottom to the top,

&gt; Has got to stop!

&gt; We have the bravery to bring back slavery,

&gt; Working in a supermarket,

&gt; Is just the start of it,

&gt; My friends there is no job at the end of it,

&gt; You will be working for your benefits forever

Verse 3:
&gt; Let me get this off my chest,

&gt; Saying yes,

&gt; We are selling the N H S,

&gt; And we'll give you less and that is just for starters,

&gt; Even after privatizing sticking plasters,

&gt; It is a social disaster that makes our hearts beat faster

&gt; Now I am your master,

&gt; The last thing this country needs, 

&gt; Is us the conservatives,

&gt; Worse than the alternative

&gt; We don't care if your driven to despair,

&gt; Don't you dare say it's not fair,

&gt; I'm not saying it's not funny,

&gt; It is to me I've got loads of money

Chorus 2:
&gt; This is the party of the mother fuckers,

&gt; The country is run for me and my mothers,

No, you're wrong. You do not get a personal allowance if you earn over £120, 000 p.a. 

If you earn between 100 k - 120 k - your personal allowance will vary so your personal allowance will change depending on how close you get to the 120 k figure. 


Here is the formula

&gt; £10, 000 = (net income - £100, 000) / 2 = adjusted personal allowance

So let's say you earn £110 k. (110k - 100k) = 10 k

From Wikipedia: Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the first season of the show a rating of 90% based on 73 reviews, with an average rating of 7.2/10. The site's consensus states, ""High production values, a talented cast, and an appealingly stylized approach to the Batman mythos help Gotham overcome its occasionally familiar themes.""[45] Metacritic gives the show a score of 71 out of 100, based on 34 reviews, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"".[46]

David Hinckley of the New York Daily News praised the first episode for playing ""like a 45-minute movie, with stunning visuals that never feel like a shrunken TV version of the Batman films against which it will inevitably be measured"" and lauded Donal Logue's Harvey Bullock as a scene-stealer.[47] The San Jose Mercury News's Chuck Barney called the pilot ""a fun, dark, moody and well-paced first hour"" and Ben McKenzie's James Gordon a commanding lead, while saying Jada Pinkett Smith is ""an absolute blast to watch.""[48] Matt Brennan of Indiewire said that Gotham was ""the perfect antidote to superhero fatigue"", praising the ""bright, pop-inflected aesthetic, with urban backdrops that appear as though cut out from the panels of a comic book.""[49]

Say you buy a 2-bed house as your first house, then you have a couple of kids over the years, and you need to move to a 3-bed. People not being able to afford to move on to larger homes just means fewer smaller starter homes for the next generation of first time buyers.

Not sure how this is any different from how it is now. The only difference is that a FTB has a tiny advantage over the person who already owns a house. Most FTBs won't be competing with the person who wants to go from a smaller to a larger house - they're more likely to want to buy the smaller house.

The other thing is that, with the additional money freed up, it'll allow FTBs to pay more for the house to the seller - freeing up more to pay for their larger house.

It'll affect the LTV yes, but only by the stamp duty percentage (i.e. 3% on a house with 8k stamp duty).

But these days, sets are built off-site. Costumes are hired in. Continuity is done out-of-vision. Dramas are no longer recorded as-live, but rather out on location or in a proper soundstage.

All the reasons why TVC was so great are no longer part of modern TV. Modernising it to an all-digital HD (and SHV) facility would be insanely expensive and require a complete rebuild.

Drama has moved away and now gets shot at Elstree, BBC Park West, BBC Roath Lock, MediaCity UK or at the large range of independent film studios. These days a *TV* studio is just for non-scripted, non-narrative TV aside from a small number of sitcoms.

Saving film studios is pretty easy. They have large-ish soundstages, they're easy to re-cable, the UK is always in need of more good soundstage space.

&gt;
&gt;&gt;*For a further in-universe reference of the Doctor's name, please see the ""Doctor Who?"" running joke.*
&gt;The use of the name ""Doctor Who"" when referring to the Doctor is disapproved of by some fans, but is commonplace in the British media, the end credits of many episodes, and most prose and comic stories of the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, the ending credits for the series gave his name as ""Doctor Who"" or ""Dr. Who"", from 1963 until *Logopolis* part four, when incoming Doctor Peter Davison insisted upon a change in the credits of *Castrovalva* to ""the Doctor"". This remained in place through the end of the original series in 1989. Executive Producer Russell T Davies used ""Doctor Who"" when the series returned in 2005, but Tenth Doctor actor David Tennant asked to change it back to ""the Doctor"" beginning with *The Christmas Invasion*.
&gt;Throughout the franchise's history it has been common for media and cast members to refer to the character as ""Dr. Who"".  In fact, even Peter Davison and David Tennant have called the character ""Doctor Who"" in several different interviews.

false,Aliens_among,null,null,"Your age will have an impact re retirement. Mortgages generally won't have a term that goes past state retirement age. So in your case your max mortgage term is 22 years give or take. This will impact monthly repayments (shorter term = higher payments). Most mortgage terms are 25 years? Ours was 30 ( but we were very young and buying an expensive place with a view to make overpayments).

In terms of salary, rough guide would be 3-4x. So maybe somewhere around the 180k mark depending on credit and current commitments.  With your deposit you might be able to get a £200k place.

Edit: stamp duty holiday no longer exists. Sorry. 

Also, bear in mind the recent mortgage market review which now examines your finances in more detail for commitments like gyms, insurance, pets, kids etc. 

You can go via a mortgage broker (don't pay for one whatever you do) or not. Opinion is pretty split. Brokers are best if you have special/odd cases. 

There is a TON of information out there. I'd start with money saving expert mortgage guides. On a train so difficult to link. 
 
Another good idea is to use the 'mortgage calculators' on banks/building society websites. These don't go into your credit record. You just plug in your salary and deposit and it spits out a number. It's not entirely accurate but will give you a good idea.

Final thought - read up on credit scores etc. make sure you have a good record ( no missed credit payments, not too much debt etc). This will help you get the best rates. 

Best of luck.

&gt; You may want to cancel an insurance policy if you have just bought it and have changed your mind. By law, you have a minimum 14-day cooling-off period during which you can cancel the policy for any reason. If you’ve bought life insurance, the cooling-off period is 30 days.

&gt; The cooling-off period starts from when the policy begins or when you receive your policy documents, whichever is later. You should get a refund of any premiums you have already paid. However, your insurer may take off a small amount to cover days when the policy was in force. They may also charge you a small administration fee.

If you're in the same field as the path, it's unlikely that anybody is going to get cross if you stray slightly while looking for the way out. It's extremely common for footpaths to go through enclosures containing livestock, especially sheep (met some sheep while walking today).

Sometimes a path crosses a field of crops, but the farmer has just ploughed the whole thing and then failed to restore the path, either carelessly or because he doesn't like ramblers.

In such a situation, you could do the farmer a favour and try to skirt around the edge of the field^1 , but if you're on a public right of way, you're entirely within your rights to follow it.

A phone with GPS can really help you in accurately recreating the path. Use OpenStreetMap, not Google^2 ; it's usually much better for footpaths. Alternatively, if you look carefully at the far side of the field, you can sometimes see the next stile, or one of those little posts with the yellow arrows.

^1 Sometimes they intentionally give you a path around the edge; while it's [not legal](http://www.environmentlaw.org.uk/rte.asp?id=207#elem_1832) to just plough up and cultivate the right-of-way, I don't particularly hold it against them if it's done properly and doesn't lengthen the path too much.

Even if that is not the case, the Tardis had it's safeguards down. It's probably extremely stupid and dangerous for the Doctor to try to fly through the time lock anyway. Not only did he nearly cross his own timestream, which alone could create a hole in the fabric of time if his younger self remembered it, but he broke through the time barrier.

The idea in that episode is that the Doctor could fly there, but not with the Tardis safeguards on because it would be catastrophic. Basically, he's lucky he didn't leave the Tardis.

false,lgf92,eng-northumberland,Land of the Sausage Roll,"This is my somewhat uninformed quasi-legal opinion (I'm training as a solicitor and the HRA is often used as an example of British adherence to European law as it effectively confirms our adoption of the European Charter of Human Rights).

I think scrapping the HRA is not only a populist decision to please the ""fackin yooooman roits, it's awww gawn mahhhhhhd"" crowd but also an attempt to reduce the amount of European influence in British law and British lawmaking. The British government's decisions and actions have been challenged and overruled repeatedly by the ECJ and ECHR, and I don't think it likes that. 

The relationship between British and European law is a complicated one. Broadly speaking, British courts have sovereignty in domestic affairs, but individuals and enterprises are free to appeal to European courts when all other avenues are exhausted. Lord Denning put it well in 1974:

*But when we come to matters with a European element, the Treaty [of Rome] is like an incoming tide. It flows into the estuaries and up the rivers. It cannot be held back, Parliament has decreed that the Treaty is henceforward to be part of our law. It is equal in force to any statute.*

I think scrapping the HRA is not only a populist decision to please the ""fackin yooooman roits, it's awww gawn mahhhhhhd"" crowd but also an attempt to reduce the amount of European influence in British law and British lawmaking. The British government's decisions and actions have been challenged and overruled repeatedly by the ECJ and ECHR, and I don't think it likes that.

The relationship between British and European law is a complicated one. Broadly speaking, British courts have sovereignty in domestic affairs, but individuals and enterprises are free to appeal to European courts when all other avenues are exhausted. Lord Denning put it well in 1974:

*But when we come to matters with a European element, the Treaty [of Rome] is like an incoming tide. It flows into the estuaries and up the rivers. It cannot be held back, Parliament has decreed that the Treaty is henceforward to be part of our law. It is equal in force to any statute.*

This has been fiercely debated, but it's been shown time and time again that Britain cannot just disobey European law because it wants to. That's what held up the Abu Qatada deportation. That's what led to the scrapping of Section 64 of the Terrorism Act that let police stop and search anyone for any reason in London. That's what's preventing many injustices from taking place.

Now we're looking at a situation where European law is doing things like compelling us to let prisoners vote, and I don't feel that the current government is willing to concede such unpopular ""yooooman roits"" decisions and risk being held responsible.

In terms of matchdays, it is a case of either going down your local with the boys (if it is on the box, or you know somewhere who will pirate it), or heading to the ground. If you go to the ground you will get there about midday for a 3 o'clock kickoff and hit a few pubs on County Road, probably hungover you will force down the first few pints before you hit your stride. You will always see people you know (and sometimes ones you haven't seen for years), have a chat, catch up whilst waiting for the lineups to come out.

Generally, if the employer is offering to match contributions to a certain level it makes absolute sense to make the most of that. Anything over and above that, IMO, makes more sense going into a personal arrangement. You'll get much more flexibility and choice with investment options and potentially much better management charges. At the moment, Nest is charging 1.8% of every contribution that goes in plus a 0.3% annual management charge.

Nest is gearing toward ""pot follows member"" but it's not definitely implemented yet. If your next employer doesn't use Nest, the pot won't follow you.

You don't need a pension provider specifically for freelancers. They'll all accept contributions from pretty much anybody.

Inflation can be expected to put a significant dent into how generous the allowance increase actually is, not sure the HR increase will be an increase of any significance in real terms. The HR band has been hammered a bit in recent years aswell.  Feels a bit more like a promise not to hit them again TBH.   



note: current annual allowance is £10k not 10.5, if you're &lt;65

Also I assume £50k higher rate to be the cumulative i.e. including the personal allowance.

Or the bookies on the corner of Goodison Road that you go in to put your First Scorer bets on... There are also always promo girls giving out leaflets to shit restaurants or similar... Dixie's Wall, which shows the impact the club has had, or the Everton In't Community fundraisers who show the continued impact.

Fun stuff. 

---

I have said before, but if there is any way people who are fans of sport can make it to Goodison, they should.. If you are an Everton fan, then get those fucking kidneys out (yes, both of them if you have to, we have dialysis machines now).

It is a real special place- it is the oldest purpose built football stadium in the world and you can feel the history. Sitting in the main stand with the wooden seats and timber structure you can literally feel the atmosphere below your feet. Walking down Goodison Road and reading the club landmark messages on the wall still gets me every time... It really is one of the great arenas in the world, it should be classed next to Lords and Centre Court in terms of significance.

It is impossible to put into words, and (I don't mean this to sound conceited at all) there is no way foreign sports fans can understand football culture in Britain. Yes, other places are just as passionate, some perhaps more so... But ours culture is unique- no other place can compare to Goodison for history, and very few can compare the utter embeddedness we have in the community- The People's Club is the god honest truth.

If the only thing that stops a TARDIS going through the time lock is a safeguard, which in turn relies on a ""responsible"" time traveller to keep it in place, then we must suppose that all the other time lords - Rassilon included, who was evidently prepared to destroy the universe at one point - were, nonetheless unwilling to turn the safeguards off in their TARDISes in order to bypass the time lock and escape the fall of Gallifrey.

And then we must consider the Daleks. If bypassing the time lock were a question of safeguards, did they - who have also been willing to destroy the universe - not dare or choose to turn their safeguards off in order to bypass the time lock at any point?  

And then there are the other named and nameless horrors which were evidently being held in the time lock. Were none of them powerful enough to travel in time? Or, if they were, did they each choose to keep their safeguards (or equivalent) on?

Perhaps it is only TARDISes that had the power to bypass the time locks, and not any other, inferior, form of time machine, and perhaps they could only travel from one side of a timelock to another, and not from within a timelock - but then we still have to wonder why no pre-timewar incarnation of the Master or the Rani or the Monk etc seem to have appeared in the post-timewar universe? Were none of them really as reckless or willing to create paradoxes and endanger the universe as the Doctor?

false,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; He's talented and interesting but the fact that graffiti now seems to be classed as vandalism until proven to be a banksy is embarrassing for everyone involved.

FWIW I've observed there's two kinds of graffiti (to my untrained eye): Artwork and tags. 

Artwork - ala Banksy - is fantastic and often very very technical. 

Tags on the other hand are simple and often boring or rude in their messages - gang tags or bored kids tagging things for instance. 

There is a grey area in between where some artists make their tags highly artistic. 

Here in Birmingham we recently had an event called the 'City of Colours' where a huge range of artists came and tagged walls around the Digbeth area. You can read about it here: 

http://www.cityofcolours.co.uk/

Graffiti is even finding its way off the streets. My business has recently moved into a new office space and we're getting local artist [Gent48](http://www.gent48.com/) to do a couple of pieces on walls in our office (being Birmingham based ourselves, one of the pieces will heavily feature local landmarks like the Bullring etc.)

false,ajehals,null,null,"&gt;No one with an ounce of sense can struggle to eat on JSA, I certainly didn't have any trouble.

Probably worth taking into account that this tax cut costs more than JSA does by a large margin..

&gt;The idea is that with lower taxes you get more money to put where you need it. 

The issue is that when you cut a service (especially if you cut local council funding..) you end up with people spending far more for a given service than the council or state did when they were providing it. You lose the economies of scale. A classic example is web access, quite a few libraries where I am are limiting access, or charging for it because of cuts. That leaves people with the option of either paying for internet access directly (expensive if you don't have a lot of cash in the first place) or using stupidly expensive internet cafe's or similar.  

Sometimes it makes much more sense for a council or the state to provide a service and the money saved and handed back to the taxpayer may well be insufficient to replace that service if it is cut.

Oh, and obviously when we hear things like 'raising the lower threshold to help those on low incomes' we have to remember that tax thresholds have an impact on all tax payers. Rising the point at which people pay tax doesn't just benefit those on the lowest incomes, it benefits those with the largest incomes too.",0,1412193401,null,0,false,0,ckxr1o7,t3_2hztza,t1_ckxr1o7,t1_ckxqac1,null,1426732296,7,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,7

Five is somewhat put off by Six because of how different they are, and Seven likewise doesn't enjoy his previous incarnation's company. Six would dislike both of them, and possibly everyone else.

Ten would be gleeful at seeing Five, and probably happy to see Eleven again. Eleven is glad to see Ten, goofs off with Two, but is horrified at Twelve because of how *old* and grumpy he's become.

Four would get along well with Eleven, but they weird out the other Doctors. Eight, Ten, and Five are total bros.

So am I better off just paying into my own scheme and forsaking the employer contributions?

Denning, for example, is talking about the EU there (Following the European Communities Act 1972), and the corresponding loss of British sovereignty, which has nothing to do with the ECHR.

Individuals can appeal the decisions of domestic courts to the ECtHR on human rights grounds, but the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) deals mainly with cases with member states and EU institutions as claimants and defendants. Individuals can bring cases, but only against EU institutions. It's for the European Commission to bring member states to court, and disputes between individuals are for the domestic courts to resolve (of course, European law with direct effect will be considered by said courts in deciding). If a domestic court fails to apply European law correctly in such a case, the Commission will take that member state to the ECJ.

Though of course the Court of Justice of the European Union also has a supervisory role, as well as a judicial role, in which they can explain a point of European law to a member state court who refers to them for such an explanation under article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (what the treaty of Rome is called post-2009 Lisbon Treaty).

Finally, it should be noted that we were party to the ECHR long before the Human Rights Act 1998 was passed. The ECHR came into force in 1953 and we've been part of it since then. British cases could be taken to the ECtHR before the Human Rights Act 1998, and that avenue would continue to be open if the Human Rights Act 1998 was repealed. Continued membership of the ECHR is not dependent on the Human Rights Act 1998.

I am denying it. So if it is so easy that an idiot or someone with half a brain cell could understand it, then it won't take much effort for you to explain the logic behind it.

I think the reality is you don't really understand how polling estimates and research as a whole works - and you are looking at statistics that seem to fit your world view and you're fitting them to it as you see fit.

If what you were saying is true then surely the polling companies that produced these would combine them and release the evidence that ""a significant number would be glad to see homosexuals put to death"".

4. Similarly, did you expect Eric Dier to go out on loan when he first arrived? I worry about his playing time over the course of the season, and wonder if he might have been better served at a Championship or lower Premiership side where he'd be a first choice central defender.

The Human Rights Act makes the ECHR binding in British courts. Cameron's British Bill of Rights doesn't change the fact that we are a signatory to the ECHR.

So the UK government is still subject to the ECHR, just like Scotland; this plan just makes it more expensive for all parties to enforce it.

It doesn't matter that the government doesn't like them, they are *our* protection from *them*. Which is why, to me at least, it is mind-blowing that people like Farage and May can stand up and, in essence, say ""We will take away rights you can enforce against us!"" and people *cheer*!

The people who have left are mostly cashing in, or being driven out by high costs.

The cuts need to be made in the face of the deficit, it sucks that librarys have to close along with police stations and post offices too. They are across the board, with the NHS ring-fenced. Something to remember is that the government is not obligated to provide libraries for the people of this country. This is a privilege that the people of this country have that costs money at the end of the day to run and this country is in a lot of debt. Would you place the cuts elsewhere? Probably and then you're taking away from that aspect of the country. The cuts are necessary.

Why does it matter if it benefits those with higher incomes?
