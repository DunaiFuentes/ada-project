true,severedfragile,lfc68,,"I'll try a few:

The goal conceded against Kompany - playing the man instead of the ball, as he so often does. 

The goal conceded against Negredo - Mignolet's mistake in the end, but Skrtel was also guilty of reacting to the danger rather than reading it, something he has to do if he pushes up, and pushing up is something he has to do to make our system work.

The Eto'o goal - waiting to see instead of seeing where the threat that Eto'o did and even making a decent attempt to stop it. He reacted neither to the ball nor the one striker in his vicinity.

The Charlie Adam goal - great as the strike may have been, Martin backs up all the way, waiting for the ball to hit him when he should have been rushing to stop the chance before Adam even came away (not to discount some of the other mistakes made by his teammates for the same goal).

The Jordan Mutch goal (where the other defenders aren't blameless) -  Skrtel seemed oblivious to the free men outnumbering his defensive partner - again, more focussed on the man he was defending than the danger.

The OG vs Hull - again, holding his position too deep instead of closing down the danger, opting instead to hurl himself in the way and deflecting the shot in. It's a mistake Carra made pretty often too. 

These are just a few off the top of my head where he might not have prevented a goal but his approach and mentality were all wrong, and after a year and a half of this, he should have adapted more by now. Carragher did and he was about to retire. You also dismiss the shirt-pulling far too easily; it's not just a massive liability that I can't *believe* he keeps getting away with, but it's also symptomatic of the larger flaws in his game that I've mentioned time and again - focussing on disrupting the man rather than dealing with the danger and neglecting other threats as well. If you're attacking a corner near Skrtel and he's grabbing another player's shirt, you know his attention's there and you have time and space you shouldn't be left with. 

I'm not ignoring Skrtel's strengths or pretending he can't defend under the right circumstances, I'm pointing out some of the problems with having him as the ever-present in our defence. He's not just a problem in himself, but his problems also prevent his defensive partners from forming effective partnerships with him under the current style.

1. How well he adapts to doing more defensive work (if he can show better positional discipline, then he'll be a better defensive player than Pirlo is, and thus need less 'protection'), and 

2. How much we come to rely on his distribution from deep to pull the strings - whereas Pirlo's teams inevitably build themselves around his distribution, I don't think that necessarily has to be the case with us under Rodgers - Allen, or whoever plays 'the Allen role' in the CM spots, could arguably be more important to having cohesive play in the opposition half. Thus, if Gerrard gets marked out of a match, it shouldn't be as big a deal as when that happens to Pirlo.

This is in contrast to CBs, for instance, of which there are a ton of top players.

I guess an easier way to say it is that there are Albert Riera wingers and there are Juan Matas. Riera has streaks of brilliance and could be gotten by lots of clubs. Mata is consistently brilliant and only a few could afford/lure him. Right now, because he hasn't gotten his shot, Salah is Riera-level.

The media and government tend to demonise all men and particularly fathers, when in reality the most risky situation for a child to be in is with a single mother and usually her partner. Conversely, the safest situation is actually for the child to be with the father and ideally both biological parents.

The Face considers the Doctor an old friend, which people started to believe means Jack Harkness, when in reality, the Doctor probably has met the being at some point in the past.

The fact that Jack was nicknamed the Face of Boe does not mean he'll become it in the future. It was simply a nickname probably chosen by the Time Agency because of where he's from and also because the Face exists in the 49th century also.

The idea that Jack Harkness will eventually run out of whatever is making him live is speculation as well. We don't know how Jack is kept alive, For all we know, Rose rewrote reality to make Jack Harkness a fact of the universe and did not give him any energy that keeps him alive.

true,buried_treasure,null,null,"Before the 21st century it was almost unheard-of to see armed police anywhere in the mainland UK other than at airports. Of course there were plenty of armed police available, most major police stations had both an armoury and trained officers who could be scrambled as necessary to deal with armed criminals or terrorists.

Then after 9/11, just like in the USA, everything changed. Armed police started having a much higher profile, appearing at various transport hubs and at times even on the streets close to ""high profile"" targets such as Parliament or Buck House. They also re-organised the police internally so that instead of keeping the guns only at the police station's armoury they made much more use of Armed Response Unit vehicles -- ordinary police cars but containing a strongbox with the guns inside, and which were driven by firearms-trained officers ([details](http://content.met.police.uk/Article/Armed-Response-Units--Specialist-Firearms-Officers/1400013622269/sco19)). The idea being that they could respond to any incident far quicker than if the guns were solely kept at the police station.

This all probably peaked in the immediate aftermath of 7/7 and then had started to be scaled back a bit. Then the Olympics happened and everything went nuts, as you say there were police officers with SMGs at all the main London train stations as well as in many other places. And despite the Olympics having finished nearly 18 months ago, this time it still doesn't seem to have been scaled back so quickly (I've seen them many times at Liverpool Street as well).

I suppose one difference to the USA is that the majority of ordinary police officers don't carry firearms and don't want to carry firearms. Any officer you see with a weapon will have had to undergo extensive training, well in excess of what I understand US cops do.

In Australia, until recently it was not unusual for people to measure their height and weight in Imperial measures, even although Australia changed to metric back in the 1980s. However this is changing and most now measure weight in kilograms and more are measuring height in centimetres.

The question is, not whether one uses metric or Imperial measures, because most people use both. For example millimetres for short lengths, and mile for greater distances.

The question really is, which type of measurement is predominant, or becoming predominant, and that is very clearly the metric system and it's measures.

true,Anotherfuckwit,english,England,"I'm a headteacher and Ofsted inspector in the UK. 

The school will have a complaints procedure that you should follow. At first glance, it appears that you have two specific complaints to file and both are quite serious.

The first is that the teacher belittled the pupils and should be directed towards the headteacher. Be clear about exactly what happened, witnesses and what you would like the school to do as a result of your complaint.

The second (and strangely more serious) is that the nature of his comments suggests that the school is, at least in part, failing to teach an appropriate curriculum. A formal complaint on this matter should be sent to the school's governing body, Local Authority or if very serious, to Ofsted.

That being said, before you get to the formal complaint stage you should ask to meet the headteacher and teacher together. The school should have effective systems in place to arrange this meeting. You must be allowed to take somebody into that meeting with you. See what they say and if you are satisfied with their response. LISTEN to them - sometimes it can be a misunderstanding whereby e.g. The teacher was promoting a debate. In such circumstances, yes your daughter was right to be offended, but there is a difference between a teacher trying to prompt a response but misjudging it by going a bit too far and wilfully abusing his position and failing to provide the set curriculum.

Go into the meeting with an open mind. Let me repeat this. GO INTO THE MEETING WITH AN OPEN MIND.

If you leave the meeting unconvinced that this was a genuine (and appropriate to the circumstances) attempt to promote open debate then you should follow the procedures I outlined at the top.

Do not publish any information that may identify the school or any staff member on any social network (here, Facebook, Twitter, etc.) That being said, if you need further advice on your rights, general complaint procedures, curriculum, issues then feel free to PM me - I **do not** want to know which school it is.

**TL;DR: At first glance you have two serious potential complaints. Find out what happened directly from the horse's mouth and then follow the correct procedure.**

&gt;The needs of children must trump adult preference.

Indeed, but no one should stay in a relationship that that has broken down to the point they cannot stand each other, married or otherwise that type of home environment is damaging to the child. What needs to happen is parents start putting their child first instead of focussing on what a wanker their ex partner is. 

You also seem to be ignoring the point that couples will split up, married or otherwise and to think a piece of paper will change that is a rather outdated view. As I said originally, support for couples with children is important, but it's not going to solve the problems that are already there in society.

I see people arguing that the complete lack of oversight of police actions and use of force is disturbing, the fact that 700 criminals have died in police custody, because of police action and not a single officer has been arrested for a single death since 1969, you're not going to try say that all 700 of those people deserved it for being ""gun carrying thugs,"" are you?

This is just another in a long line where the police have fed the media with misinformation and lack of context of given situations to cause confusion, rumours and outright lies to circulate; ultimately meaning the public side with the police in fear of the ""big bad gangster.""

Most people feel for Mark because he died unnecessarily. You can argue all you want that he was a ""gun carrying thug"" but the point remains, he was unarmed when he was shot and the gun was found 20ft away - not exactly what you'd call an immediate threat.

Those two facts alone should have every single officer involved in front of a Tribunal, giving individual statements of events and not being allowed to discuss it as a collective.

What we got instead was lies, misinformation, contextual information missed entirely and to top it all off they let the police sit *in a group to discuss and write their statements.*

You're trying to make it out that people are defending the criminal, in fact no, they're trying to defend our democratic and legal systems that are supposed to be built on fairness and an understanding that two wrongs don't make a right.

true,whencanistop,eng-GreaterLondon,Greater London,"&gt; The biggest scandal of Benefits Street, which Channel 4 is unlikely to reveal, is that White Dee is behaving rationally in deciding not to work. This is not something ministers like to divulge, but Policy in Practice, a welfare and employment consultancy, has run the figures for The Spectator. Dee is a single mother with two young children. Were she to earn, say, £90 a week as a cleaner, then the system would reduce her benefits by £70 — an effective tax rate of 78 per cent on that £90 she’s earned. She’d thus be slaving away all week for £20 — far less than the minimum wage. It doesn’t get too much better higher up the scale — a £350-a-week job leaves her a pathetic £35 a week better off. If she landed a £23,000-a-year job, she’d be just £2,100 a year better off than if she’d spent the year sitting on the sofa watching daytime TV and chatting to her pals on the street. This is nothing to do with indolence. Which of us would work at a 91 per cent tax rate?

Ignorring the fact that working 14 hours a week on minimum wage for £90 is ""slaving away"" are these figures right? Has he picked some upper limits of where the tax credits run out? It would be good to see the source documents, because this smells like bullshit to me.

He managed to make it very near the stage before the security in front of the stage cottoned on to the crowd cheering, saw him coming, and got him before he got on camera.

Right, well it would be highly unlikely to be the biggest stadium. Get realistic. It would probably be around 60,000 to max 70,000. London's population is massive. But Wembley is basically accommodating a whole footballing country and it's 90,000. Right now there are 5 London teams in the Premier League. Although two of them at least, have a good chance of being relegated. Earl's Court is probably the prefered location now. Good for transport, decent size, probably room for expansion and other complexes but might be a bit tight.

Now the main reason we need a stadium is not because of the match day revenue. But because you are allowed to secure investment in club infrastructure such as a new training ground etc against FFP. So for everyone 100 million you invest in building a stadium, 100 more million you're allowed to spend on players. It's a way for FIFA to encourage building up a club as well as buying the players. So if we can commit around 800 million into a stadium complex buy and build we get that benefit. And then the extra match day revenue on top of that.

The laws in Spain generally give the top two teams a benefit. As for the copious amounts of corruption that bolster their income that largely comes from the club Presidents so they can promise huge war chests to fans so they get voted in. Why do you think Perez could fund Ronaldo and Bale. I mean he funded basically the whole Galaticos.

In light of the FFP stuff I stated earlier I wouldn't be surprised if Real Madrid bought back their training ground for more or less nothing (Perez will probably get it rezoned again) then invest a fair bit in it to keep them within FFP easily and so on. Just like the last time after that really.

Oh and FYI: The Capacities of stadium's in the Area:
Stamford Bridge = 41,837
Emirates = Arsenal = 60,361
Selhurst Park = Crystal Palace = 26,309
Craven Cottage = Fulham = 25,700
Boleyn Ground = West Ham = 35,016

(Also the Stadium of Light, an hour from london) = Southampton = 32,363

Outside London the area with the Biggest stadium capacity in total is Manchester, followed by Newcastle/Sunderland.

Old Trafford = Man U = 75,811
City of Manchester Stadium/Ethiad = Man City = 60,000

true,IAmManMan,null,null,"Assorted trivia facts about the 50th off the top of my head:

Kate Lethbridge-Stewart is the daughter of Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, more commonly referred to as the Brigadier. Played by Nicolas Courtney he first met the Second Doctor and was a regular companion from then on. He was in both the Three Doctors and the Five Doctors episodes which were the previous anniversary specials. Courtney died not too long ago but it seems the writers couldn't let an anniversary special go by without a Lethbridge-Stewart. 

The Zygons first appeared in ""Terror of the Zygons"", a Fourth Doctor story. 

The space time coordinates the Eleventh Doctor carves into the wall of the Tower of London (the ones Clara subsequently uses to travel with the vortex manipulator) are the date of the first transmission of Doctor Who (23101963).

Kate says on the phone to look up a file ""70's or 80's depending on the dating"" which references the UNIT dating controversy which I highly recommend you read the Wikipedia page on which would explain that better than me. Just search UNIT dating controversy. 

The Eleventh Doctor wears Amy Ponds round-rimmed reading glasses at several points in the story. He inherited them from Amy after she was stranded in New York of the past by a weeping angel. 

Clara works at Coal Hill school. The same school Ian and Barbara, the First Doctors first companions, worked at in ""An Unearthly Child"".

The opening of the episode is the same as the opening to the first episode of Doctor Who before fading into colour. A sign on the wall points to IM Foreman's scrap yard, which is where the TARDIS was first parked and where it assumed its trademark phonebox shape. 

Clara can be seen wiping off the words ""No More"" on her whiteboard at the start of the episode which become important later. 

Elizabeth I first appeared in ""The Shakespeare Code"" where she seemed to hate the Tenth Doctor. It was not explained why until the Doctor makes reference in ""The End of Time"" to an off-screen meeting with her where he deprived her of her nickname (the virgin queen). The meeting was not shown until the 50th. 

The ""round things"" are called roundels and were a staple of previous TARDIS sets. The museum at the end of the episode also features roundels on the wall behind the Curator.

I had to lower my rent expectations after a month of my property being on the rental market to the point where I was paying over a £100 a month toward the cost of the flat. Hardly profiteering, and in reality my tenants got a subsidised property.

They also got brand new furniture, a brand new kitchen, and brand new decorations (none of which they had to pay for). They were provided with gas and electricity safety certificates at my expense, and had the ability to move from that property when it suited them. They got to call me to deal with any issues they had without having to dip their hand into their pocket, and they got to call me to bitch and complain if minute issues didn't meet their expectations.

Think if your not investing your capital elsewhere, it's in a bank, and then your funding the bankers and their bloody bonuses! Why is it that all wealthy people are held under the same regard?

I'm not defending the Daily Mail, I wouldn't even want to eat my chips off it but what does my head in is that so many people on this subreddit believe anything that comes from their ideals, or their idea of good journalism.

The jury concluded Duggan threw it over the wall I haven't read anywhere where it says whether; he threw it out the window, or threw it after getting out the car.

As for speculation about Duggans involvement in organised crime. Seriously, what on earth are you talking about?  
  
* He was a suspect in a criminal investigation. Why ***can't*** the press report on how involved he was with organised crime? That's their job for crying out loud.  
  
* If their investigative work leads to the fact that he was associated with organised crime, *why can't* the press show a picture of him in a club throwing gang signs with his arms around two convicted murderers? They didn't invent any of that, they're showing who the guy was.  
  
&gt;What is it you believe the press reported that was ""spot on""? Their speculation about how high up the ladder of organised crime Mark Duggan possibly was?   
  
Yes, for crying out loud. Of course they were!  
  
They were presumably reporting from sources close to the investigation and later, reporting directly from **evidence shown to the jury**. Evidence showing that; Tottenham Man Dem were listed by the MET as *""second, on the Met’s Organised Crime Network matrix, making them the second most harmful gang in the capital""* and that; Duggan was a long standing and senior member.

true,UKteacher9999,null,null,"I have some questions for an Ofsted inspector! 

1. I have been involved in a series of Ofsted inspections at different schools in the last year. In each one, inspectors have had completely different focuses and quite varied standards. In some, for example, grade 3 marking would result in a teacher's grade 1 lesson being downgraded. In others, these would be considered independent of each other - the grade 1 lesson awarded and the poor marking would be considered towards evidence of marking around the school. What is the general standard for this? 

2. I understand from the new 2012 framework (and even more so from the 23rd December updated subsidiary guidelines) that didactic teaching and periods of 'passive learners' aren't reasons to downgrade a lesson by themselves (and only if this results in slowed progress during the lesson). However, I fear that inspectors will continue to look for a certain preferred style of lesson and ignore the rare occasion when a didactic lesson or activity does aid progress. What do you think you and your colleagues will actually do in inspections - follow the guidelines or critique didactic teaching? 

3. Similar to the last point, really - now that the subsidiary guidance says it's not realistic to expect perfect differentiation for every student in every lesson, do you see Ofsted inspectors softening this focus, or ignoring this update? 

4. I keep hearing different stats about this one... what percentage of teaching needs to be Outstanding for the school's teaching to be graded Outstanding? And similarly, what are the % requirements for other grades? I've heard 80% Grade 1 lessons for an overall Outstanding, and I've heard 80% good and no Unsatisfactory. And various other wildly conflicting sets of data. A little clarity would be good please! 

5. This is about progress. Let's say you watch a Year 11 lesson where students make Outstanding progress. However, data shows that students are unlikely to achieve target grades by the end of the year. The data shows that students have progressed this year with their current teacher, but progress in previous years was poor. How would you grade the lesson? 

6. The same question, for Year 8 pupils... where students have made poor progress in Primary, and are now making rapid progress, but teaching is Outstanding, how would you grade the lesson? 

7. Would a school be looked upon unfavourably if they have a lot of overseas-trained staff? I'm thinking of schools in hard-to-staff areas who may recruit significant numbers from Australia, the US, Canada and New Zealand, for example. These teachers could be well supported through internal processes and all attain QTS. 

8. This is just a silly one really... for a 'Good' for Achievement, the School Inspection Handbook says 'the proportions of pupils making expected progress, and the proportions exceeding expected progress in English and in Mathematics are close to or above national figures.' Ie. achievement is average or better. My question is: doesn't this mean only half of schools can be graded Good or better, since by definition, half of schools will always be below average?  

9. Apart from the obvious things we're told about, what do you think is the best advice you could give to school leaders, to improve their schools?

1 - the latter. We cannot change a grade once it is given. Most likely scenario is that in your first example the inspector saw a great lesson and, whilst in there looked at books and was unhappy with what they saw. 

2 - judgements should be formed on the impact that teaching has on the learning and progress of children. The 'new' guidance you refer to merely adds clarity to an already established point which states that we should not make judgements based on any particular teaching style. This originally became an issue when teachers thought we insisted on seeing a three part lesson. We don't *care* how you teach! we are only interested on the impact this has on learners.

3 again is a clarification. 'Most pupils' is more than half. Expectations are actually tougher but, I believe, more realistic. I would expect 'all' pupils to be effectively challenged and making progress for a lesson to be judged as outstanding. This doesn't mean there should be 30 different pieces of work given out.

4 no teaching can be less than good and much is outstanding. There are no percentages given because it isn't a formula based merely on lesson observations. You could hypothetically see 100% outstanding lessons but books show poor progress and data also shows a lack of progress (though highly unlikely). Quality of teaching judgement will not be outstanding because outcomes are poor.

5 as with the point above, overall judgements are based on a range of evidence. Whilst observing teaching may result in an outstanding grade it is then linked with other evidence to provide an overall judgement grade. A lesson obs is *one* piece of evidence.

6 judgements on progress are made from pupils' starting points.

7 no, It would not be reasonable or appropriate for us to say, e.g. This teacher is poor because she was born in ... We would only comment on the quality of teaching and the factors that impact upon this.

8 it says 'expected' not 'average'. There is a big difference.

9 ensure your SLT understand the difference between leadership and management. Then you can delegate responsibly and effectively and generate an ethos of continuous change and development.

Even Bobby has said (albeit not explicitly) that it is a one year thing. In his tea party discussion he says that there is no problem bringing in players like Deulofeu or Lukaku short term on loan, because improving the team for a season is still a good thing. During this time he never mentioned Barry as a short team deal, instead talking about him like he is a fixture for next year. 

Whilst it would be nice to get Lukaku, we probably have about the same chance of bringing Rooney in.

That aside, of course, the instant a situation gets iffy, it's the duty of parents and police to place the safety of children first. It appears to have been the case on this occasion.

The king died with no legitimate heir. The crown passed to his advisor who claimed he had been promised as such on the King's deathbed.

Almost immediately a Viking king claimed he was the rightful heir and launched an invasion landing on England's north eastern coast. As Harold journeyed north to defeat the Viking invasion, a Norman Duke also readied his forces to attack from the south. 

At that point in history anyone of these three men could have claimed the English throne. If the Vikings had defeated Harold they could have claimed the country. If Harold had not rushed his army back to take on William he might have been victorious. As it was, William won, conquering England and launching a kingdom that dominated world affairs for a thousand years, shaping the English language with French influence and bringing with him the French culture of law and justice.

Sturridge is a world class player, but his injury record  is spotty at best. For large parts of this season we only had one fit striker.

The striker on loan couldn't get a start for the team last year when he was fit. That said, I think he might mature into a useful squad player. Anyway we can't recall him for the rest of the season.

So yeah, I think we could use another striker for back up if Sturridge gets injured again and we don't have to depend only on Suarez. If we do qualify for the CL, we'll need a deeper squad and another striker will be necessity, assuming Aspas will be moved on.

The problem is that most affected people seem to feel like they're the only ones who are legitimately in the ATOS system and the real problem is the unnamed, faceless *other* - all those evil people gaming the system, while they - the *real* people in need - are being oppressed unfairly by an inhuman system!  The problem with this of course being that benefits fraud (particularly for disability benefits) is a tiny fraction of what people think it is.

I have to appreciate that this letter doesn't appear to have that attitude, and I only hope that more people who are being screwed by ATOS (or have family/friends/colleagues who have been) come to realise that these systems are in place by the choice of successive governments - often in no small part to deal with the habit of previous governments to shove people onto incapacity benefits to massage down the unemployment figures.

This will only change when people stop thinking ""why me?"" and start realising that the government is using an industrial compressor to crack a walnut - quite probably why a lot of the government's rhetoric is designed to get people to blame the *other* instead of the system that is screwing many of the people who need it most.",0,1390054972,null,0,false,0,cesobpp,t3_1viob1,t1_cesobpp,t3_1viob1,null,1431996686,39,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,39

A discussion then revolved around what the moral message of both stories was (be nice to people) and other examples were cited from the rest of the class. It was clear I was not buying into any religious aspect of the Bible story and I did not mention god or Jesus at all (except as a sarcastic expletive) but the debate following it was very instructive. 

I guess what I am saying is it all depends on the teacher you have and how they approach subjects. I am sure my RE teacher was a bona fide Christian but was not willing to challenge me or any of us with the theory of creation. I suspect he would not like the way the discussion would go given that I was a solid gold smart arse when I was at school and had an answer for pretty much everything. It helped that I was well read and  bit of a polymath because of my family, friends and an inherently inquisitive nature. 

I hope this incident with the English teacher was just a misunderstanding as although at 12 years old I would definitely have defended evolution picking holes in creationist theory I don't dare believe that would normal for kids today. I hope I am wrong. But I still bemoan the demise of public speaking lessons in school and even though I went to a bog standard comprehensive feel that we were lucky to be pushed in so many areas both physically and mentally on a regular basis.

He's a bit impish and edgy and while I think that works very well for The Doctor I don't think I'm likely going to crush on him. I'll probably like him very much like I like the Doctors I don't particularly crush on. I didn't crush on any of the first 4 or 7. I didn't crush on 9 or 11. 6, that's another story, I still have yet to watch most of his episodes. I just cannot get into Colin Baker's Doctor at all. Not his fault, I think, the series was written abysmally bad during his tenure and from what I gather he didn't get to present the Doctor he wanted to do at all, but in the end I just find his Doctor nearly unwatchable and I do think that affects how I see him overall sometimes, unfortunately. Baker himself is a nice guy. I've met, and back in the day he was not unattractive. I can't say I'd have likely crushed on him, too negative about his Doctor to go there, but do I think he would have qualified as ""handsome"" when he was younger certainly. 

I don't have to crush on a Doctor to like him and see him as wonderful in the role. The fact that I did absolutely crush on 5/10 and 8 is not a bad thing. I enjoy it, the slight hormonal rush watching them is nice, laugh, but still in the end I'm a Whovian and it's the show and the character and I usually keep watching even when the current Doctor doesn't ""light my fire"" as they say. Tom Baker had women falling all over him in his younger days. Matt Smith apparently makes some women salivate the same way today. Personally neither one of them does a thing for me but to each his or her own thing, right? I'm sure Capaldi will have his share of admirers that way just by virtue of being The Doctor. He's not a bad looking older guy. I don't find him much of a heart throb myself particularly but I am sure plenty of people will and that's cool by me. 

That's the nice thing about The Doctor actually. His face always changes and if you're not particularly gaga about one incarnation, well there's always the next one, isn't there? I expect that I'll enjoy watching Capaldi in pretty much the same way I enjoyed watching CE or any of the older Doctors I didn't have a ""thing"" for. CE comes to mind a lot actually. I actually really enjoyed his Doctor but I can't say he does anything for me romantically speaking. I still regret he didn't do a couple more years at least. But then again if he had we might not have had Tennant and that IMHO would have been a tragedy because he was one the best Doctors ever, I think. The man's pretty face doubled my enjoyment, I freely admit that, grin, but it was definitely far more than that that made him special. Capaldi will find his own way in the role. It could be that he will be the best Doctor yet. Who knows? But I'm willing to give him a shot, even if he's not my idea of a ""pretty"" Doctor.

To be honest, our measuring system is a mess! :p Height and weight for me = always feet &amp; inches, stones and pounds (I have no idea my metric measurements, I'd need a calculator!).

Though I expect when my grandparents go (though they're only 69... while yet!) I may just stop using Fahrenheit. 

I think I'm prone to estimating things in Imperial as any DIY stuff (building go karts, repairing cupboards) I would do with my grandad. And after school when I was little I was always picked up by my grandparents, so Imperial was often used. For children who did these activities with parents 20 years younger than my grandparents, this may well be different. But all my friends use Imperial for personal height and weight. However, many of them estimate the weights of other objects in metric! I guess as this was more prevalent in the school curriculum (in Physics, for example).

Another interesting thing to note is that a lot of gyms use fitness programmes on their computers that record measurements in metric. Therefore, a lot of people my age going to gyms or using fitness programmes on phones may well be accustomed to checking their weight and height in metric first!

1. If you use Google Chrome install an extension called Proxy SwitchySharp.

3. Open Proxy SwitchySharp options and configure a proxy profile for the server you picked in step 2.

4. Turn on the proxy before opening the youtube stream page (you might need to repeat step 2 before every game because the servers change a bit).

5. Wait for the stream to load and then turn Proxy SwitchySharp back into Direct Connection mode, basically your normal internet connection.

true,thisisappropriate,null,null,"Apply on the student finance website. You can use your parents details and it will be based on whatever they submit/HMRC tells student finance about their income. If they have a quite high income then you can do the application without their details and get ~£5000 per year as a loan if you're living away from home. I was pretty frivolous in my first semester when I was paying ridiculous amounts for accommodation (£480 pcm, September-July) on a £5200 per year loan. So for much of the year I lived on a small amount of savings (£600) and a further £600 interest free overdraft. £10 a week for food is doable if you like not going out and eating mostly porridge and basics rice with beans or frozen vegetables.

1) Choices early on will change how much or not you life may suck. I recommend picking up a social sport (ultimate frisbee is really taking off at the moment) and trying to get a cheap room in halls first year. The social sport means you'll meet people who like being with lots of other people, in different years. Often one or two people have a car if you need to get somewhere, and at least half the alcohol you buy will be in huge boxes from the local supermarket for pre-drinks. It sets you up well for a house-share, when older team-mates move out of a large team house or moving in with a few of the team. (Also, team-mates may have jobs they can recommend you to their boss for.)

2) Not a good idea. Just apply for student finance as directed to on their website, if you get a better loan than expected, keep quiet. If you try to mess them around then they will give you a bad day.

3) I would recommend looking at a student account. I have Halifax's and it was easy to get a £500 overdraft at the beginning and upped it to £1000 mid first year. They require you to pay your student loan into them, but most student accounts are manageable online and the overdraft is free. If pretty much sounds like an overdraft to me, look at how long its interest free for - just first year is a bad idea. Most student overdraft accounts can go to graduate overdraft accounts, where its still interest free for a year after your course ends while you pay it back.

4) Student finance / get a job (now or when you get to uni) / beg on street corners / suck up your pride (take a little room in halls/eat basics brand food/don't go drinking) / when you get to uni, manage your money as well as you can, if you still fuck up and need a little extra at the end of the loan, talk to your student advisers at uni, they may be able to give you £50/100 as a little loan until the next loan gets in.

5) Cities are better than towns, but everywhere has jobs if you look and aren't too picky.

Cabinet ministers aren't the people making these regulations they will be overseen by DECC who are regarded as a very competent regulator in the North Sea.  All these scare stories from the US are irrelevant, the regulatory framework they have is no where near as strict as here. Companies are not allowed to use secret chemicals in their fracking fluid here. Americans are known in the oil and gas industry for having a disregard for safety and maintenance issues compared to the british. As much as big business will have an influence on fracking regulations it looks as though they are going to get this through tax breaks rather than lax health and safety regulations.

They are opposed to all foreign interventions, but for some reason (maybe just paranoia) strongly support the military and want to increase its size.

But immigration and the EU, and especially immigration from the rest of the EU, completely dominate their thinking.  When asked about other policy areas, they often find some tenuous connection to European institutions or immigration and focus on that.  For example, their official stance on same-sex marriage is that they oppose it purely because they imagine that the European Court of Human Rights will somehow force churches to conduct same-sex weddings.

true,JimmyNic,null,null,"I broadly agree that it is a good thing that Christianity is being forced off the centre stage of public discourse, and would certainly support disestablishing the Anglican Church. There are two things that bother me about this piece though.

&gt; As for practising her beliefs, Odone can do that, too. Same-sex marriage is not compulsory; it is very much an opt-in scenario. Cristina Odone will not be forced into a lesbian coupling, nor will she be forced to have an abortion – nor, should it become law, will she be made to embrace assisted dying, even if her death is agonising and the pain impossible to relieve.

I don't know if this is a deliberate mistep on Ince's part, but saying ""If you don't like abortion, don't have one"" clearly ignores the thrust of the anti-abortion argument, that abortion is murder. As a comparison, moral vegetarians believe that killing pigs just to eat them is a kind of murder, and telling them they don't have to commit murder doesn't answer their moral objection to the practice. Compare also: ""If you don't like rape, don't commit it."" 

I'm in favour of abortion, but to prove its moral acceptability one has to refute the notion that it is murder of a person in a meaningful sense. This is easy enough to do with a bit of basic knowledge about how consciousness developments, though the argument is a lot greyer than most give it credit for – it is not really possible to say exactly when an embryo/foetus is conscious enough to be considered a human. Alternatively one can refute the idea that the pregnant woman is in anyway obliged to be the embryo's life support, which is what feminists try to do via a dialysis comparison. 

As for the gay marriage argument, the social conservative position revolves around a theory that the family unit is the linchpin of society, and anything that undermines it will cause widespread social deterioration. This is a form of collectivism that many of the left should be able to relate to. To refute this one must either prove that the family unit is not as important as they think it is, or alternatively that gay marriage will not damage it, and might even enhance it. This was the tack that David Cameron took when he said he supported gay marriage because he was a conservative.

The trouble with much debate is that it often consists of two parties arguing points on the basis of completely different premises, rather than arguing the merit of those premises. 

&gt; Whether you agree with diversity policies or not, you can see how Christian Concern’s “sober” discussion of marriage might have made the management a little edgy. I, too, do not have a given right to perform at any venue. A venue can say “no” to me on grounds of my opinions, but not on the grounds of my faith, race or sexuality. The venues’ uncertainty was not about hosting Christians; it was about hosting a political event covered in religious fairy dust.

In James Curran's book on the press he refers to a phenomenon known as ""market censorship"" in which certain opinions are hidden from view because they cannot get a platform to express them. As far as I'm concerned all religious beliefs are political in nature, whether espoused as such, and I don't see why if it's legal to refuse someone a platform because they are a racist it should not also be legal to refuse someone a platform because they are a Mormon. This gets to a nasty habit of the left that used to be the province of the right: censoring opposing opinions out of fear someone else might find them persuasive.",0,1390061065,null,0,false,0,cespyoe,t3_1vivlq,t1_cespyoe,t3_1vivlq,null,1431997418,83,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,83

""The ""never-worked families"" hypothesis is convenient for ministers and alarmist columnists, but is it in any way true? Important new work from the authoritative CMPO thinktank at Bristol University explores how disadvantage trickles down the generations – but also takes a cool look at the facts. Using the best official data, the research confirms worklessness is a major problem: in 3.7m working-age households, 18% of the total, nobody has a job. But two-generational worklessness is far rarer – workless parents and grown-up children are found together in only 0.9% of households. As for homes with two generations that have never worked, the fraction drops further, to less than 0.1% of the total. Of course there will be some ""never-worked"" families where children have flown the nest, but the little data available suggests these, too, are uncommon.

The truly double-generation long-term unemployed family is, then, a rare species. As for the politicians' ""third-generation"" perma-idlers, these are on the critically endangered list – if not entirely fictional. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation set out to identify and investigate 20 such ""never-worked"" families in deprived Glasgow and Teesside, but it found not a single one""",0,1390062392,null,0,false,0,cesqekh,t3_1viob1,t1_cesqekh,t1_cesol75,null,1431997647,21,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,21

&gt;See section 6 of this report by [1] DECC[1] 

&gt;However, the evidence seems to show that where the problems are
genuinely attributable to shale gas operations, the problem is with poor well design and construction, rather than anything distinctive to shale gas.  In the UK, well design and construction is addressed by the
Health and Safety Executive through specific regulatory controls, which among other things require verification of the well design by
an independent third party. 

Hardly reassuring given the 34% well integrity failure rate in the North Sea currently.

&gt; must also be scrutinised by the Environment Agency or Scottish Environment Protection Agency in Scotland to make sure there is no risk to the environment, and in particular to water sources, by the Health and Safety Executive for safety, and DECC to ensure best use is made of the resources. As part of this process, operators are required to disclose the content of fracking fluids to the Environment Agency. The HSE then monitors progress on the well to determine if the Well Operator is conducting his operations as planned. The HSE are also notified of any unplanned events and if it is deemed necessary, inspections may be undertaken to inspect
specific well operations on site.

Claims were made in the video posted yesterday that these agencies terms of reference and regulatory frameworks remain loose, and that, for example, the HSE hadn't visited one site in the NW in two years.

&gt;agreed that a pause in hydraulic fracture operations is appropriate so that a better understanding can be gained of the cause of the seismic events.

This was said to be a gentlemen's agreement not a regulatory power of the agency.

&gt;All these scare stories from the US are irrelevant, the regulatory framework they have is no where near as strict as here.

It would be wise to keep them in mind though, surely, especially considering, despite the disregard we agree they show, several towns and districts in the US have imposed moritoria and bans on fracking due to the environmental effects.

&gt;Companies are not allowed to use secret chemicals in their fracking fluid here.

Again, yesterday's video suggested that companies due to begin fracking the UK have been forced to admit, despite their obvious intention to obscure the fact, the publicly proposed formula for fluids here in fact only refers to the exploratory drilling window, and that, assuming they can get away with it, they fully intend to use an identical slickwater formula to that used in the US when drilling proper begins, including all the carcinogens and toxins which have been reported.

Add to this that it was reported a couple of day back that the UK has [blocked plans for pan EU fracking regulations](http://www.eenews.net/stories/1059993039), which is hardly reassuring either, as they certainly wouldn't have done this if they intended to make them _more strict_, would they?

true,cxsmith,null,null,"I'm going to jump in here but ignore your last paragraph. Not because there's anything wrong with it, I'm just not going to comment on it.

A quick look at Wikipedia says that (in Sweden): ""There is no specific permit for carrying guns. For civilians it's illegal to carry a firearm unless there is a specific, legal, purpose (hunting, going to range, etc.). The general guideline, for transport of firearms, is that the gun must be hidden and transported in a safe (unloaded etc.) and secure way (under supervision etc.)"".

From my understanding that is completely different to many US states, where you do not need to transport guns unloaded or for a specific, legal purpose.

In terms of getting a gun in the first place you need a license: ""The gun license is obtained from the Police, and one must be in good standing and at least 18 years old, but exceptions regarding age can be made. To apply one must either be a member in an approved shooting club for at least six months or pass a hunting examination (jägarexamen). The former is mostly used to legally acquire pistols for sport shooting and the latter for hunting rifles and shotguns.""

Again, that strikes me as very different to the US. Is there a law that you must be a member of a gun club before you can own a gun, or that you *must* have a license?

Switzerland

""Switzerland practices universal conscription, which required till 2010 that all able-bodied male citizens keep fully automatic firearms at home in case of a call-up. Since 2010 all service weapons are stored in local armories"".

In other words, all able-bodied males are *trained* to use guns in, presumably, a safe and responsible manner. Also:

""The annual rate of homicide by any means per 100,000 population was 0.70, which is one of the lowest in the world.[16] The annual rate of homicide by guns per 100,000 population was 0.52"".

true,jenniferocious,silence,Silence,"I don't think he's attractive or unattractive at this point. He's just a man, somewhere in the middle. Though when they unveiled him as the next Doctor my first thought was that he *looks* like the Doctor, if that even makes sense.

That being said, I don't think Tennant is attractive or unattractive either, and I never did. Initially I thought Matt Smith was just plain *odd* looking, but I think the fact that he became my favorite Doctor (and learning more about him through interviews and stuff) changed the way I perceive him physically. I still don't think he is a ""pretty-boy"" or anything like that, he isn't traditionally attractive at all. I totally get why people would say he is weird looking or unattractive, and I definitely have moments where I would agree with them, but that doesn't change the fact that I have a bit of a crush on him.

I don't think Capaldi is icky any more than I thought Tennant was icky. I don't find either of them particularly attractive, but certainly not *icky*. I'd put Eccleston in this category too. None of them are typical ""pretty boy"" types, so I don't get why a lot of people are claiming that they are. Just because they are younger than Capaldi doesn't mean they are automatically more attractive. But I think that the youth factor is a bigger issue here; many Doctor Who fans are younger, and they can picture themselves with a younger looking Doctor a lot easier than an older one. Also, having a physically younger looking Doctor makes it easier to whine about how he should hook up with Clara (even though 11 and River had a bit of a Mrs. Robinson vibe going, and nobody was upset about that).

I just don't get why everyone thinks we've had an era of ""pretty"" Doctors just because a lot of female fans have been getting hot and bothered by them. Correlation does not imply causation. It isn't even like we've had an era of particularly *young* Doctors, Smith being the exception. Eccleston is 49, Tennant is 42. 

Anyway, I don't watch the show because I'm hot for the Doctor. I watch the show because I like the show. Anyone who thinks otherwise is welcome to jump ship, but I think it is silly to watch a show and to claim to be a fan if the only reason you watch is because you have the hots for one of the actors.

Alright, let me start off by saying the whole notion of a ""pretty boy"" Doctor era generally pisses me off. I don't think the show's staff would stoop as low as to cast good looking actors for the role over the actor who's *RIGHT* for the role, and I will loudly pass that on to any of the disappointed ""fangirls"". (I will keep using this term to describe fans who will stop following the show due to casting choices.)

However, I myself have been accused of being a fangirl whenever I tell people 11 was my favorite Doctor. ""Oh, you're not a *real* fan then, you're just watching it for the actors!"" OH HELL NO. I can't STAND it when I'm told (yes, told) that I'm not a REAL fan. For me, Matt Smith and his portrayal of the eleventh Doctor epitomized my personal ideal of who the Doctor is. The crazy wandering traveler who still marvels constantly at the marvels of the universe(s). The mediator who can solve seemingly impossible situations and problems with an insane idea out of left field. The loner. Something about how Matt Smith acted the role just grabbed me in a way none of the other ten doctors had.

So yes, I am incredibly sad to see the end of Matt Smith and Eleven. But not because it's the end of the ""cute doctors"" or whatever. I am still very excited to see how Peter Capaldi's Doctor turns out. And I will continue on with the show. The fans who don't? Whatever.

true,cock_blockula,null,null,"&gt; the UK has blocked plans for pan EU fracking regulations, which is hardly reassuring either

I disagree, pan EU regulations don't make sense due differing geology and the fact that vested interests in other areas of the energy sector will lobby to make them stricter than necessary in an effort to prevent competition i.e the powerful French nuclear industry. Also the UK already has much of the regulatory framework in place and can produce the additional statutes quicker than the EU will.

&gt; fully intend to use an identical slickwater formula to that used in the US when drilling proper begins, including all the carcinogens and toxins which have been reported.

They might intend to but I'd be surprised if that's how it works out. If Shell could get away with using the rigs they use in Africa here they would but regulations won't allow it. Even so carcinogenic materials will not leak into the water table provided drilling is done competently.

&gt; Hardly reassuring given the 34% well failure rate in the North Sea currently

Where is this figure from? Even Frack off claims it is less at 18% and their source own shows that this figure is bullshit and yet your figure is even greater, so I'm highly skeptical of it. The source frack-off supply relates to failing integrity checks not actual leaks. This doesn't mean they have failed it means the uncertainties are outside what is permitted by the regulator or in other words there is too high a chance of well failure, i.e if the well has say a 2% chance of failure it needs repairing back to an acceptable standard. This doesn't mean the well has actually failed. Many of the wells in the report were taken offline until the issue was resolved. 

Of course US counties have banned fracking, quite reasonably in fact, as they don't have the power to make sure it done properly due to the poor regulatory framework that exists in the US.

Edit: I think I see where your 34% figure came from, I found the number on frack-off.

&gt; North Sea: In 2009, the Society of Petroleum Engineers’ forum ‘North Sea Well Integrity Challenges’ surveyed 100 participants. These indicated that an average of 1,600 out of 4,700 North Sea wells had at least one anomaly.

An anomaly in an integrity check is not a well failure. I'd never really had much of an opinion on frack-off, as there are plenty of reasons to be in skeptical of fracking and certain guarantees do need to be made, but that website is full of so much disinformation I've really lost any respect I had for them.

true,jenniferocious,silence,Silence,"Exactly. The Doctor is a confident, charismatic character who likes to sweep young women away from their dull lives and have fantastic adventures with them. He is emotionally damaged enough that he needs ""fixing"", and is dangerous enough to be exciting, but you know that while he *is* dangerous, he would *never* harm his companion. The character is a female fantasy by default, regardless of what he looks like. 

It sort of amuses me (and I meant to put this in my original post, but I got on a tangent and forgot to) that I remember back when Smith was first cast everyone was all upset because he was ""too young"" to play the Doctor. Now Capaldi is ""too old"". I think some fans just like to have something to complain about. If it hadn't been because he's older, it would have been something else.

While I'll miss Smith, I'm looking forward to Capaldi. It will be interesting to have Moffat at the helm with a different Doctor. I trust that they have made the right casting choice, and that I will continue to enjoy the show.

true,thatcambridgebird,null,null,"I'm kind of late to the party, but figured I'd throw in my twopence worth, particularly as we moved to Cambridge when I was in my mid-20's, so like you I was coming to it from a different perspective (moved within the UK though, not US/Europe). 


* In a sentence, Cambridge for me is chilled, beautiful, interesting and most importantly, home. Despite being a dirty northerner, the city is where my heart is now. I can't imagine living anywhere else (apart from maybe Tuscany. I'd be well up for that). 

* Late 20's I think you'll be fine here. A huge number of our friends are in this age range, and everyone likes to do different stuff within our social circle, with no one complaining that they're bored or Cambridge doesn't meet their interests. For me, the one thing I found lacking was a decent rock club! Sadly, Cambridge is a bit 'townie' in terms of its available nightclubs - all very middle-of-the-road Europop places. There's a club called The Junction which has a lot of good nights on for rock/drum and bass/dubstep, but these are once a month or so. Saying that, London is only 45 mins away, and Cambridge has a huge amount of fantastic bars and pubs which (for me, now) are a nicer way to spend an evening with friends

* It is really easy to get round Cambridge on bike/foot. I wouldn't recommend car/driving in the city centre at rush hour unless you absolutely have to. I live 5.5 miles from my workplace, which takes me 30 mins to cycle (there's an excellent cycling network here which I'm sure you already know). The same journey by car, when I needed it for meetings offsite at work, took me about 50 minutes on one morning. It's honestly better, if you can, to invest in a bike like so many other residents have done! 

* Housing varies depending on the size and type of place you want. I haven't rented for a number of years as we bought a place. I'll leave that for others to answer, but anecdotally, a friend is looking for a place at the moment with her husband (and baby on the way) and I think they're looking at about £1000 per month rentals and upwards, for 2 bed flats. 

* Expense: again, it varies. My gross salary is less than yours and I'm not begging on the streets as yet! Anything in the City or South Cambs area will immediately be more expensive because these are the more affluent parts of the county. My council tax, for example, is Band C and is £134 per month. The friend I mentioned above currently pays exactly the same amount in the City for a one bed flat (we have a 3 bed house outside the city centre in a village called Great Shelford). Cambridge can be crazily expensive if you feel you absolutely must have the nicest flat in the most central location, but if you're willing to consider commutable villages you can grab some less expensive bargains! 

* Negatives - really only what I mentioned above. Traffic can be soul destroying if you get stuck in it, because there's so many private schools on my car commute that I get stuck behind 4000 chelsea tractors with one kid in, being delivered to the Perse. Erm... like someone else said, it can be a little dead if you are into alternative music/clubs, but the pubs more than make up for it. Weather-wise, it can get a bit rainy (before we moved here, it rained on every single visit when we came to look for a house), but no more than other average UK cities. 


There's always events on, which is brilliant, especially over summer time. There's a large park area called Parker's Piece, and that has a 'summer pop' event on (all free, with a stage, stalls etc). That's nice to go to with friends and have a picnic/drinks. Same place also has a big Town and Country show once a year, which is kind of like a family fun day with an animal petting area, stalls, food and drinks and so on. Again it's all free so it's good for a laugh. There's an AMAZING beer festival in summer, on Midsummer Common, which is into it's 41st year. There's also winter ale festivals through the colder months. 


We have a lovely Arts cinema (in the process of being sold, sob) which'll hopefully still be in place when you get here! There's also the standard multiplexes and shopping centres, and transport into London is brilliant if you run out of things to do here. 


I think I've written waaaaay more than enough (sorry!), but hopefully that helps with a flavour of another view alongside what everyone else has already said!

Toure and Dzeko were both on their game today, though Toure did give us all a scare there when he went down after the goal.

My biggest complaint was Kolarov, who just had a shitty match as far as I am concerned.  He got beat a few times, his passing was sub-par for his skill, and he just didn't play like his normal self.  I also think he had a difficult time with Noone who had a remarkable match, so it's important to take that into account.  However, rewatch the final corner for Cardiff and watch Kolarov; he just sat on his arse, marks absolutely no one, and watches the ball go in.

&gt; I'm not taking sides either way but that reeks of a cover-up and people being ""got at"". It's perfectly possible he was involved in something untoward but was rich and influential enough to ensure the silence of others, much like Savile.

Actually by implying he is still guilty you are taking sides. Also, Do you really think its possible a politician whose political power had long since gone could send the men in dark hats to ""get at"" witnesses. Any evidence for that?

More important that which subjects you pick is being able to establish on your personal statement how much you love your subject. To that end, I would advise you to find some extracurricular activity which relates to physics. For me, I applied for engineering with physics, further maths, history, and philosophy &amp; theology, and also obtained an amateur radio licence, built a simple radio and a few antennas, etc, and got 'work experience' looking over engineers' shoulders for a week. It sounds much more impressive than actually was, but that's kind of the point. I'm not sure what a comparable thing for physics might be; maybe see about getting work experience in a lab? In your first year of physics, you're going to be using the LaTeX and C programming languages (iirc) so maybe have a look at them? Definitely read a lot of physics books, even if they're only popular science things, and have a look at some journal articles (but don't panic! You won't need to understand them until graduate level. Try older ones first, like Einstein's 'big four'. See if your local library has Jstor.).

**The most important thing with the Personal Statement is to be able to say, ""I love physics with every fiber of my being, and here's the proof.""**

My advice would be, if you're sure you want to do physics and want an easier first year of uni, do the electronics and all the maths you can possibly cram in, but remember that once you're at Oxford, you might never be able to study psychology again. Probably neither will affect your chances of getting in enough to make a real difference, so do what makes you happy!

Why? Because people maybe have more of an opinion than just ""I like this hur dur"" or ""I don't like this derp"", and might actually want to express their views by commenting, *that's* a sign of ""suppression""?

This is because Reddits algorithm disguises the actual upvote / downvote count with other numbers in roughly the same proportion as the actual ratio. This is *precisely* to avoid the mass downvotes you accuse the system of displaying.

&gt; Another tell is the continual downvote of new comments even though the thread should be dead.

Ah, so because YOU'VE read it, someone reading it a couple of days later shouldn't have an opinion?

When I worked in bars I was sober, the bouncers were sober, and the clients were drunk. Most of them were fine and well behaved. The ones who were not always thought they were perfect little angels persecuted by the mean bouncers.

Not saying it was your fault or anything, but as long as you have drink in you you will always be put in this position. Even when you're right, and they're wrong, you have drink in you so your judgement and memory of the event is in question. It's not a nice lesson to learn, but learn it. It will be more useful to you in the future than blaming underpaid security. In their defense they still kept you under their protection. They had every right to throw you out on the street, like what's happened to me, and other guys I'm sure, but they still made sure you were safe. Their responsibilities are to ensure laws are being followed and their clients are safe. Your priority might be to drink and party with your friends, and to have a sneaky little fag because it doesn't count when you're drinking. That's not their priority, and never will be, ever. So get used to it. Don't blame minimum wage workers because you need to consume a drug.

The Scottish licensing laws have changed in recent years and the consequences for bar\club owners are not good. Consuming a drug in their establishment is not a right, it's a privilege that they can take away if they suspect (rightly or wrongly) that you could be a problem.

true,CitizenOlympic,null,null,"It's hard to get one head out's of the Statist mindset. We make excuses for it, we believe it to be the normal order of things. It's just how things are. We almost certainly never call things as they really are when it comes to the State. We don't call taking of a large portion of the product of our labour theft, we call it taxation. If I took a sizeable portion of the money you earn in a fortnight you wouldn't think twice to call it theft and take steps to remedy the situation. We can easily understand that if a business were to waste its revenue and provide poor quality of service year in year out and never have to account for it they'd go out of business fast. Yet the system can do it and we never bat an eyelid. This kind of double think creates a kind of moral corruption within. For example. We don't accept the use of force to achieve an end as acceptable behaviour in our social lives but the system forces us to comply under threat of incarceration and/or financial penalty. the system can send our children to another country to murder its citizens but if we were to do the same thing we'd end up in jail. You can't walk down the street forcing money out of people for your children's education but the system does the same thing via 'taxation' and apparently that's fine. Likewise for your healthcare. It is said that the first step on the road to wisdom is calling things by their proper name. You say taxation, I say theft. You say war, I say murder. You say free healthcare, I say 'but it's not free'. My largest bill each month is my tax bill by a long way. When I hear a politician say 'We created a thousand new jobs last month' I think, but what about the thousand jobs you just took away from the free market? We have to stop making excuses and start calling things by their proper name and thinking outside of the system's box.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I have been through ATOS three times my last experience has left me particularly bitter towards them.

The first time I went through ATOS was through Royal Mail. I was having severe issues with my feet, I could not walk, I could not stand up for long periods of time without pain, and after a long illness Royal Mail referred me to them, their conclusion was I should be given medical severance from the business and sent on my way, I was not fit for a roll where I would be standing or walking for the foreseeable future. 

So after leaving Royal Mail I went to the Job Centre and signed on to be told you should be on disability for the time being, so I signed on to disability, after 2 months an appointment was made for me with ATOS. I saw their doctor whom told them I was fit for work, Not in a standing or walking roll but I was fit for work. I do not disagree with this I was capable of sitting behind a desk, answering a phone, etc. But I have no experience of this kind of work. My experience lies in Sheet Metal Work, joinery and posting letters.

Now I am sure any of you whom is in the position of employing people, would not really want to employ the person with health issues, that has never answered a phone in an office, never typed a letter etc. But nevertheless I would have loved to have had the opportunity to take on a desk roll. After years of walking the streets of Northern England in the pouring rain, a comfortable desk job would have been wonderful. 

So back to the job centre I went, to be sent for all manner of positions I would never have a hope in hell of getting, I felt like it was a colossal waste of their time and mine, when I enquired about training I was told you must be unemployed for so many months, before we will even think about it.  

Eventually my wife gained employment, I took over the role of house husband and father and my mobility improved. Eventually I went back to Royal Mail and all was good for 4 months, then I had appendicitis, after an emergency operation and two weeks off, I was advised to go back to Royal Mail on light duties, Royal mail wanted me to see ATOS again and ATOS agreed I would be fine on light duties. To stay on light duties for a month and then return to normal duties. I was fine with this, my doctor was fine with this, the management were fine with this. After a week of light duties I was preparing a delivery for whoever was to deliver it, when the manager approached me and informed me I was to deliver it. I told them they knew ATOS had said I was on light duties, my doctor said the same, and I was not taking it anywhere. 

He informed me he would talk to ATOS to clarify what they said and off he went, half an hour later he returned. He informed me ATOS had no record of me being put on light duties or them saying I should be on light duties, even though they had my doctors note in their office stating light duties. And I would be out delivering the mail shortly. I informed the manager I would be taking sick leave as of now, and I went back to my doctors got a sick note for two more weeks, and returned it my manager. Eventually because I was on a trial period my contract was not renewed. 

If I had felt capable of delivering that round I would have been out of the door in minutes and on my way, I hated being in the office, I loved walking and the outdoor somewhat wet life of a postman.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I like to watch Democracy Now from time to time although that's web based rather than TV, and also is American so you don't get ""local"" news (wish there was a UK version tbh). I'd say it's also very liberal but I find it a lot more informative as they actually go into detail with certain subjects and interview people who seem to know what they are talking about. There seems to be a misleading theme in the media that they are being ""objective"" when I don't think such a thing is possible.... Especially not with profit based news organisations.

Apart from that I either occasional check the papers or Twitter and otherwise don't bother.

I came to the conclusion that most of what I was being told wasn't useful to me in any way and seemed to be there either to distract me or not give me any kind of answer. I don't want objectivity, I want a journalist to research a topic as much as possible and give me an answer. Also I don't think if someone is murdered, or if a child goes missing the general public has any right, or should know about it. It's not news, it's terrifying gossip, and all it does is scare people and give them the impression the outside world is worse than it actually is.

An example of this was when I was in a taxi coming home a few months ago. The news came on the radio and simply stated ""An 80 year old man has been stabbed to death in his home in Bolton. Police are searching for him."" and that was it! Thank you very much for that piece of terrifying and useless info! 

So again I don't think I've given you much to go on there. Just locate good journalists and keep up to date with what they are doing and in the meantime just research subjects you find interesting. As an example you'll find out far more about what is happening in Iraq by doing your own searches than you would by occasionally hearing ""a car bomb has gone off, 50 people have been killed"" from the BBC.

Thus these people often are usually wilfully ignorant of the symbolic nature of art and the use of mythology. They are also ignorant of the social construction of reality though it was posited by a very clever bunch of athiest scholars in the 1950s and proven by another bunch of athiest scholars researching things like cognitive bias. 

If they had bothered of course then they would know that the symbolism of Muhammad and the cartoon goes beyond the basic act of drawing. It is a symbol of how post-colonial societies can protect their own heritage against what they see as encroachment by the powerful. 

To a farmer in Kabul, or a unemployed minority Muslim kid in Bradford , drawing Mohammad is not about drawing Mohammad, it's about going out of your way to remind him of the powerlessness he FEELS. 

But the people who draw are pretty sure that being rich, western and usually white gives them perfect platform from which they can deem what is a right an what is not - and the poor of the world need to suck it up.

An example is the guy who tweeted Tom Daley during the Olympics, who wasn't just arrested for the comment about Tom's Dad, but for tweets such as these 

&gt; Later, however, another tweet to Daley read: ""i'm going to find you and i'm going to drown you in the pool you cocky twat your a nobody people like you make me sick"".

&gt;Tweets to other users who criticised his earlier message were spiked with profanity. One read: ""i dont give a shit bruv i'm gonna drown him and i'm gonna shoot you he failed why you suporting him you cunt.""

Plus I don't believe them. It basically boils down to that. You can see the sort of crowd they attract, the sort of people that would love for that to happen.

The right in Britain (and elsewhere) love everything about the US as they are basically the modern equivalent of the 19th century, of which the right desperately yearn towards as the golden age. 

Warmongering imperialists who use all their cash on wars and conquests and the elite, whilst the ordinary folk are simply sent to die on the front lines all over the planet, or at best are employed to design and manufacture for the war economy. Just like Britain during its 'glory days' in the 19th century. No healthcare. No education. Just war and profit for the rich. And massive monuments plastered all over the place dedicated to glorious conquest and ""sacrifice"". 

Lots of flag waving, lots of shit for historians to write about but its all useless empty crap.

There's much more short term/get rich quick money in it for the elite in siding with the US and its provincial states such as Canada and Australia than there is in ever trying to go for a more progressive outlook on life that the EU has.

When I look at America I really do see the 19th century wrapped in 21st century gloss.

a) They don't, or they really wouldn't be bigots. Which leads me on to b) that nuance and complexity is the antithesis of bigotry. Bigots dont' do complexity which is what makes them bigots in the first place. 

As for judging things on their merits -  you judge things on merits, context, source and implications. 

So it may be a tough policy to uphold, but that degree of thought usually sees you through it. A bigot may say something sensible in the outset but a proper analysis of it, taking account of the context, the source and the implication usually points you to the holes in their thinking. 

A good example is immigration. A bigot would say ""we must control immigration"" which sounds sensible to begin with , but as soon as you start analysing why that bigot wants to control immigration, the language the bigot uses and the symbolism he creates you can begin to understand then nature of his bigotry and thus combat it.

""contaminated drinking water"" - there's not a single case which has been referred to the EPA in which water has been found to be contaminated by fracking.

""toxic chemicals"" - Emotive terminology used to make fracking sound scary. Firstly, pretty much anything is toxic in sufficient quantities, and secondly, without stating what those compounds are or in what quantities, she could be talking about something no more harmful than OP's farts.

2:36 - MP suggests that if we start ""messing"" with the water it'll affect farming - yet since fracking doesn't ""mess"" with the water (see my earlier point) this is simply the use of suggestion to imply that fracking is going to ruin farmland, when it will do nothing of the sort.

4:22 - we see a scary list of ""chemicals"" (woo!) used in fracking. Such scary things as citric acid (lemons), diesel (guess where you'd find that?), deionised water, and ye gods, silica - what will we do?

4:39 - Mrs. Scarfalot tells us that 1/3 frack jobs uses a chemical which is carcinogenic. So.The.Fuck.What? Overcooked bacon is carcinogenic and we put that in our mouths! We're talking about putting stuff down a metal tube 2 miles below the surface of the ground. If you want us to care about this Mrs. Scarf, then tell us why this is bad, don't just imply horrible outcomes. So they use methanol? Shit, best not go drinking the metylated spirit you keep in your garage! Since she goes onto talk about ethylene glycol, I'd also advise you not to bath in antifreeze. This is the pure application of chemophobia and unscientific implication to strike fear into the hearts of those who aren't capable of thinking through to logical conclusions.

05:36 - ""For comcercial reasons the manufacturers of frack fluids are not required to divulge the exact ingredients of their products"" - which is...oh..lemme see...bullshit! The DECC require not only exact knowledge of what they're permitting to be added to PON notices but also require that the product has been analytically and environmentally tested before they'll stick anything on there. Let's just tell lies though eh? Sounds easier.

Thus we will need to rely on US trade to keep us going. I think there are legitimate concerns about intelligence collusion with the US also.

The only people who have a legal responsibility for how much you drink is the club. Any bouncer erring on the side of caution is not making a mistake. Sorry you don't like that, but it's true. They are called precautions in the legislation. Bouncers have the legal authority to make as many ""mistakes"" as humanly possible, and are in fact encouraged to do so. If you don't believe me, it's written into the 2005\2011 legislation. 

She doesn't think she was nodding off at the bar, but I've heard that a million times before too and I believe none of them.

- Villa came right at us and didn't sit back. 

- We need more depth in the left wing area and maybe attacking midfield.

- Agger/Sakho being out is pretty noticeable.

Obviously general studies falls into this category, but a friend of mine who is a tutor has said that some professors view psychology, economics, even philosophy, as counter-productive when applying to those courses, since you can end up being taught unhelpful simplifications which have to be unlearnt.

Don't let that bother you too much. Many (most? certainly I did) apply to Oxford with only 3 A levels, so having a fourth AS or A level in something won't harm your physics application.

&gt;**Shipping**, derived from the word relationship, is the belief that two people, fictional or non-fictional, would be interesting or believable (or are, or will be, or should be) in a romantic relationship. It is considered a general term for fans' emotional involvement with the ongoing development of romance in a work of fiction. Though technically applicable to any such involvement, it refers chiefly to various related social dynamics observable on the Internet, and is seldom used outside of that context.

Great to see Benteke finally looking confident out on the attack again, hopefully a return to form is on the books. Bertrand really seemed to glue the defense together, before he was taken off we seemed to be holding one of the strongest attacks in the league. Gabby looked a force to be reckoned with, Delph was holding the ball and taking on playing really well, and Bacuna looked very strong pushing forward. Weimann could finally be seen on the pitch, if only for a brief period.

 Heartbreaking to see your team go out there and be by far the better team for the first half, concede against the run of play (Henderson you better backheel like that for England!) and have 2 points taken off you from a penalty that came from an obscene dive. However we didn't help ourselves after the 2 goals. Sylla looked helpless, abysmal show from him, would much rather have seen Albrighton come on. Holt didn't really shock anyone with his performance, uninspired to say the least, but at least he looked interested.

 Overall very pleased with the performance, if we can take that to Everton and then back home that would be very welcome.

Though on PickedJesus point are you saying that you would disagree literally with **everything** a bigot said on any subject solely because they are bigoted about something else?

I wanted to because this attitude disturbs me, and I don't think that ignoring it will help to solve anything. I do not want Liverpool to be associated with this.

true,Quazijoe,null,null,"**Regarding the Age of the Doctor:**

I expected this. Moffat was very adamant and explicit in his view of the doctor as a elderly figure.

The 50th Anniversary episode was almost Spoiling the change.

&gt;""What's wrong with Being an Adult"" 

-War Doctor

I kind of view Ecelston as the middle age version of the doctor.

The Tennant and Smith Era were definitely geared toward the attracted audience at the time. Plus their doctors were more about the youthful pursuits and contrasting their exterior with their internal characteristics.

Young on the outside, old on the inside.


Like the doctor was in conflict with himself, putting up a mask to show the world a false view of himself. 


Which makes sense considering what we learned about him and the time war.

So now with the resolution of the 50th, and having the doctor stay in his young body for so long on trenzalor, he got comfortable being himself again, and being viewed as the wise old adventurous man.

In that way it's almost like he became okay with being an old guy again.

There is a lot of symbolism and metephor in the progression of the doctor and his regenerations. It's hard to say what capaldi will be like, until we see him act the part. 

**The Companion:**

I hope clara maintains her relationship with the doctor, That slightly flirty, possibly attracted to him, best friend thing. 

But then again she has to progress as well. She can't be with us forever but I like to think she will be given a chance to evolve as a character, and see her make decisions and choices that she can be in conflict with. 

Clara has a personality but it hasn't been allowed to flourish yet, as she is constantly reacting to the Doctor, and his lifestyle.

the most Character progression I think we saw from her were two moments from the christmas specials.

One when she is present with the doctors and the moment. Where she is crying because she thinks he is doing the wrong thing.

And the moment where she is exposed to the aged matt smith on trenzalor, and his actions to protect her.
 
Usually when the Doctor Regenerates the companions have to react to the change in personality usually by the doctor being somewhat incapacitated and as a result they have to become somewhat independent.

I look forward to clara's interactions.

**In regard to the shipping:**

Despite the doctor being elderly, they will still ship Doctor/Companion.

There will just be a lot more Silver fox references going about.

He is a handsome man, and the suit does him justice, though I wonder what his outfit will be, probably nothing too garrish, but a few specific things to sell the merchandise and make his look iconic.

Regardless, this is the pre Doctor nervousness. The whovian will always re adapt.

The only backlash I might see happening now is with parents trying to explain why the old guy is kissing all the young people. I hope they don't bend. The doctor has always been creepy in that way. Lets not change it now just because he looks different.

It's like his potential is stretched too far, generating plot holes, dead-end concepts like The Silence (comparable to the Observers in Fringe, which was resolved badly), and irritating, conflicting ideas like 'doesn't work on wood' and, in the latest Christmas Special, 'I'm OCD, what's their excuse?' Taking a little time to rant a bit: 

OCD *is not an adjective*. Also, the sonic screwdriver does bloody work on wood, thank you very much. In Silence in the Library, the door is waterlogged. That's why he can't open it. Not because it's made of wood. In The Vampires of Venice, he's trying to open a door that's barred. Oh, sure, the reason a screwdriver trying to use sound waves to move a heavy object can't do it is because it's made of wood. No. What are musical instruments made of? Wood seems to do a pretty good job of conducting resonance.

I love Matt Smith, and while he presents the fun-loving explorer doctor beautifully, he isn't as good at dramatic speeches as Tennant, which is only a tiny little niggling annoyance, not even really worth counting.

Last season he made 4 league starts: The loss against West Brom, the loss against United, the draw against Sunderland, and the draw against City (where he was substituted off). He's played 7 league games in 18 months, and only 3 where he went 90 minutes.

In Kenny's full season, he was a good player for us, but he's always been injury prone. His back injury made him miss 2 years in the academy, he's had a groin injury, multiple hamstring injuries, a torn ACL.

Kelly is almost 24. Look at similar players, around his age or younger. Bertrand, Smalling, Jones, Walker, Caulker, Gibbs, and that's just the British contingent. Those players all have over 120 senior games in all competitions. Jones (who is almost 2 years younger than Kelly) has 126, which is the fewest. Walker and Bertrand? Over 200. Kelly? 66.

Would you, if you were completely unfamiliar with any of their work, pick any of these faces out in a crowd and name him an Adonis?

Probably not.

But what you first see as worthy of judgement and maybe even derision becomes endearing. 1's an old grandfather, and his age suits him. 2's a lovable trickster, small enough to squeeze out of a tight corner. 3's an action hero, all flash and bravado. 4's a mad magician, with a trick up his sleeve (or yours, or in his scarf, or under his hat. Somewhere, anyhow). 5's a noble but gentle leader, almost fatherly in his sweater-vests. 6 is...well, 6. He's his own man, and no one forget it! 7's a wise and patient (if manipulative) teacher, 8's a gentleman and a scholar, and 8.5/War's a man on a mission. 9's battle-worn but in his eyes you can see he's still kind and full of wonder--once you get past the nose. 10 looks like he's all sharp edges, in features and attitude, but he's won most of us over. 11's boyish looks and childish delight give lie to his ancient age and world-weariness, a stark contrast which is difficult to achieve with an older face.

It's not their looks we love, though, it's the character behind them. That's what makes these men into the one Doctor we love, and which turns an odd face or funny hair or strange attire into something that not only draws the eye but affection as well.

Sure, who doesn't like a pretty face on TV-- but that's not the point of the show, is it?

He looks like he's trying to compensate for lack of acceleration by guessing and looks every inch the defender embarrassed by 17 year old sterling 18 months ago. He doesn't even do the leadership stuff he was supposedly brought in for. Our strongest defensive leader has turned out to be the youngest, Sakho, speaking of whom he was in the training photos before *stoke*, meaning he was effectively over his injury in 2 weeks. Yet he's still not ready a week later, did he have a setback? Because we desperately need him back, if we rely on skrtel-toure we'll struggle with bournmouth let alone everton.

I don't understand how Rodgers can have looked at performances of the lucas-allen-henderson midfield, including against a similar set-up team in cardiff in december and thought FUCK IT I'm leaving out 2/3 of that midfield and going 4-2-4. The december performances with the 4-3-3 and a 1-2 central midfield were our best of the season, but Gerrard simply doesn't fit into it if L A and H are available. He's not as good as Lucas in the deep holding role; he's not as good as Allen or Henderson in the physically demanding dual box to box roles. But, I get that Rodgers (a) liked the 4-3-3 midfield and (b) will play gerrard if available, so he found a role for Gerrard that in theory would mask his lack of mobility while allowing him to use his passing range (ignoring his lack of defensive awareness, slowness to see and react to danger, reluctance to play the simple quick pass upon winning possession). And... today he dropped the 4-3-3. So what we ended up with today was the worst of both scenarios - trying to shoehorn Gerrard into a position he's inferior to Lucas at, while also removing the reason to shoehorn him in there in the first place (the 4-3-3). The alternative to the 4-3-3 is the 4-4-2 midfield of Lucas and Gerrard deep supported by Coutinho and Henderson from wide. That midfield took some stick earlier in the season and was clearly inferior to the 4-3-3 but compared to today's it was safe as houses.  On the other hand the Henderson-Gerrard midfield was last seen previously at Goodison in the last 20 minutes when we were getting torn apart through the centre.

Obviously the Hive is happy to take people's money before they kick them out. My other friend ended up getting chucked out too for dropping his drink deliberately when it became apparent that our mate was getting punted. This ended up in a comical tug of war, with the bouncer trying to remove him from the entrance to the Hive, and me holding his waist pulling him back in.

I am now your average British 18 year old, and I can tell you that none of my peers would even consider that, and neither would I. Only the most desperate go for these jobs, despite the fact that they are ridiculously easy to get. There are a plenty of other jobs (retail, catering) welcoming to my age group that very few recent immigrants would even have a chance at competing for due to their limited language and work skills, nevermind appropriate qualifications that most of your 18 year olds will have.

There's a reason that work conditions as described above are illegal. Hence, instead of saying ""employers are to blame too"", employers /are/ to blame.These low paid jobs for immigrants exist because no native will go for them for a normal wage; it's easier and more profitable to live off benefits if they can't find a better paid alternative. And of course, noone would want to pay a vulnerable immigrant full wage. Also, it's usually the easiest option when you come to a country with no money or language skills. Solution? Be more pro-active in busting the illegal employers and preventing under wage labour. Encourage your native population to join the already existing workforce. It'll reduce the amount of underpaid labour, increase living and wage standards and stop immigrants from 'taking all the jobs'.

The kind of massively underpaid and illegal-hour jobs should not exist in the first place, and then we wouldn't have to worry about them being taken up by immigrants because none of our British workers want them.",0,1390082291,null,0,1390083804,0,cesxqky,t3_1vih8c,t1_cesxqky,t1_ceste8t,null,1432001147,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,vyvyan,,Bitter.,"Daily Mailawi: The country is ruled by a defrosted Margaret Thatcher, her corpse having been cryogenically frozen and smuggled into the country. There is a monarchy, the head of which is a mystical Lady Diana. Rumour has it that she died many years ago, but the populace believe that she is immortal. Appearances are often made, with a frail, blonde haired woman emerging from the palace balcony in large sunglasses and a headscarf to wave at the amassed cheering crowds.
In the cities, the main square is the focus of Daily Mailawian's favourite pastimes - public lynchings. There is often a jovial atmosphere as the latest suspected paedophile, failed asylum seeker, man that looks a little bit odd, or libertarian is paraded through the streets, often pelted with vegetables and eggs before being led to court, where they are tried by Jeremy Kyle, Jeremy Vine and Jeremy from Big Brother 63. The trial concludes in the accused being sentenced to death.

House prices in the country are analysed on a daily basis and anyone found making a large profit is buried up to their neck in concrete.

Corners are banned to stop paedophiles hiding around them.

The national religion of Daily Mailawi is Jane Austen.

The country leads the world in producing cures and causes of cancer, often found in every day foodstuffs.

Immigrants are executed upon arrival.

There are no passports in Daily Mailawi as nobody in the country likes anywhere else.

In Daily Mailawi it is 1933.

Each morning, everyone is required by law to think of the children.

Anyone found thinking of the children too much, or in the wrong way, is sent to Trial by Jeremy.

You've completely misunderstood what conceal-carry is.

It's not about reducing crime or violence, or eliminating it completely. It's about allowing people to defend themselves.

If you were to look at CCL permit holders in Texas for example, they are less likely to commit a violent crime or homicide compared to the general populace. Why? Because nobody with a criminal or violent history is allowed a conceal-carry license. Hell, I'd assume FAC or Shotgun Certificate owners in the UK would follow the same statistical trend.

Realistically, I think he'll end up starting Lampard or Mikel with either or coming on in the second half. Lampard to add offensive potency if we're down or 0-0, Mikel to shut the doors if we're up or even with a score (1-1/2-2) - this depends on who starts obviously.

The bottom line is this...  Suarez controlled the ball, rounded Guzan, had Guzan's knee and stomach contact his trailing leg while at full speed and turning. It does not take much contact to trip someone cutting at full speed.  Anyone who has played the game knows that there are moments when the slightest bit of contact can, at times, send you sprawling. With replays CLEARLY showing contact with Suarez's trailing leg, it can not be argued that this was a ""dive"".  The question can be raised as to whether he went down too easily.  That he was tripped up to some degree by the keeper who he was dribbling past gives him the right to demonstrate that he was in fact tripped. To not do so may mean he needs an extra step or two to regain control and perhaps not have a clear shot at that point.

While debate itself was not taught in class, we were often given projects in which we had to generate arguments which were expected to portray all sides of a story. Sometimes these would spill out into miniature class discussion groups where you would have various groups of students playing various rolls. We also conducted such discussions in geography, centred around, for example, a group of green activists, a small native town, a mining company and workers from a local city in an area of rainforest with large ore deposits. Back to english, while our teacher never took a side, it is important to note that our class was small (16 people) and she was very into class involvement. I can conceivable see a teacher playing devil's advocate in one of these situations if class discussion stagnated or was heavily one sided. 

So this sort of stuff does happen, and you are marked on being able to see many sides of a story. I am glad that there are some teachers here saying its probably ok, because this troubles me. I cant see any situation in english why a paper on evolution would have to be written, but I suppose it its one of the case studies then maybe. Still, just seems off to me. Call it my gut, but im worried.

Upon reflection, though, it's perfectly reasonable.  I arrived at that conclusion by considering the ""open carry"" movement we've got going on here.

You can find tons of YouTube videos showing these people doing their thing.

The South and Texas deservedly have a reputation for a penchant for owning firearms.  They are part of day-to-day culture for many people.  You'll see bumper stickers quoting the 2nd Amendment, warning signs on peoples' front gates, and people walking around grocery stores with pistols plainly visible on their hips.

But there's another level to gun ownership.  I'll speak for my home state, Oregon.

Despite that, we've got a [comparatively low gun homicide rate.](http://www.geographictravels.com/2013/01/the-healthiest-and-deadliest-gun.html)

It turns our that Oregon is essentially paradise on Earth for hunters.  We've got wetlands, uplands, deer, etc.  The outdoor culture is rampant, and for good reason.

So there are many Oregonians who pay a lot of attention to their firearms, but it's largely driven by hunting.

true,Jaqacake,null,null,"The only reason we would consider hiring someone under 21 is because they are cheaper to employ - young people are consistently less reliable employees (not always, about half are worth keeping, the other half are useless, maybe one in ten older employees are crap).

With that in mind yes, get a job now, it will become harder with no experience once you pass that wage barrier if you are looking in that kind of range - if you're at uni and going to be applying to graduate schemes then it doesn't matter so much, less than half my course mates had any job before they graduated (engineering), I worked bars.

Temp agencies are worth looking at, may not be regular (although I did have regular bar work through an agency when I was 20), but you then have some experience, I assume it's impossible to get a bar job in London without experience so doing events work with an agency is an easy way to get it.

Seasonal is also an option if you've got summer off, summer camps will be doing their recruitment rounds soon or may have started, they will take no experience and you don't earn much but it's a worthwhile experience and gives you something to put on your CV.

The rest of this is more for someone applying for any old shitty job at minimum wage.

Working in a charity shop does look better, I WILL ask you what you've been doing since you left school - saying 'job hunting but without much success' is a valid answer, not as good as having a job but fine, saying 'job hunting without much success so I've been volunteering at x' is significantly better.  The incorrect answer is to grunt and/or ""I dunno"" which is a common response from people your age.  Telling me you've been in prison is better than no reason (that's not something I'd discount you for, communicating in grunts is).  Being a student is also OK, I could only work in my holidays because my workload was too high in term time so I wouldn't be judging you if you didn't work, I don't think anyone in my year on my course worked part time during term time, not many friends did either, and then that was people doing something a lot less demanding.

Seriously, what is it with people 18/19/20 and just grunting?  80% of my call backs go like this:

me: ""Hi, I'm calling from x, you applied for the position of y, are you still interested?""

kid: *grunt, or ""i'unno""

me: ""right, er, OK, good talking to you""

kid: *grunt

Sometimes I continue to try and push, but for fucks sake, talk!  Why are you communicating in grunts?  You are allowed to sound like you want the job, I'm not going to laugh at you, I'm trying to give you a job.

I would say you should mention your age in your CV - no, companies can't discriminate by age but realistically they will recruit young people because they are cheaper, with no experience that is your only asset.

I recruit for minimum wage work where we specifically seek out people under 21 (then keep them if they are good and put them onto better work, but the work they start on it's cheaper to outsource than it is to employ someone 21+).

I have given work to people with some truly awful CVs, laughably bad, if someone who is 20 or less spells things correctly, can use an apostrophe and your/you're, their/there/they're etc correctly they are in the top 5% of candidates their age applying for unskilled work (can you see why I wouldn't employ people this age if I didn't have to?).  Dear god I want to recruit for a skilled position.

Apply for everything - I advertise on the job centre website (or universal job match as it's now called), I will typically get 100+ applications a day for a shitty minimum wage temporary job (that it might lead to a permanent better job if you're any good is a secret), I usually take down the advert on the first day once I've found a handful to interview and usually have read half the CV's I've received at best by that point, so don't wait to apply if you're going for shitty jobs.",0,1390085987,null,0,false,0,cesz4og,t3_1vjk8t,t1_cesz4og,t3_1vjk8t,null,1432001807,6,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,6

Speaking of Holt, he looked rusty at first, but not a bad little touch.  I think I see how he is supposed to work up front.  Holt was really creating a lot of space for Benteke by physically backing up defenders. Give Benteke space and magic happens.

Yes, bouncers are dicks, this is a well known fact, and no one's going to disagree with you there! (Except, maybe, a bouncer!)
 
However, if I were a bouncer, there's no way I'd let a woman who just got removed from the club and put up a fight about it (however small), sit on a chair outside the place. 
I've dealt with enough drunk people working in an off-license to know that there's absolutely no point arguing with them. The best thing to do is to get them to move along, which is what the bouncers wanted of you. 

Yes, their information was incorrect. What if it was correct? What if you *were* sleeping on the bar? Put yourself in their shoes. Would you let that person sit on a chair outside the club after arguing about it? The 'drunk' person complaining that they need to sit down because of a medical condition? Come on.

Yes, the bouncers could have handled it better - they should always be respectful, but I'll give them some slack knowing the amount of absolute dicks that they must have to deal with on a daily basis.

A Welshman lives next door to an Englishman. The Englishman keeps chickens in his garden and one night a chicken hops over to the fence to the Welshman's garden and lays an egg. The next day the Welshman returns the Englishman's chicken but claims the egg as his as it was laid on his property. 

The Englishman disagrees and reasons that it was his chicken as therefore the egg belongs to him. The Welshman suggests that they settle the matter by the age old tradition of a ""welsh kicking competition"". The Englishman has never heard of this so the Welshman tells the Englishman to go into his house and slip on a sturdy pair of shoes and return to the garden.

When the Englishman returns in his sturdy boating shoes the Welshman is wearing his tough steel toed mining boots. The Welshman then explains the rules. They both take turns to kick each other in the testicles as hard as they can, and the loser the first one to give up. The Englishman sounds apprehensive but agrees. The Welshman then explains as it was his garden that he should go first. He then takes a big running start and hoofs the Englishman in the nuts as hard as he can. The Englishman drops to the ground in agony and writhes around on the ground for 15 minutes. He finally gets to his feet and says that it's his turn, only for the Welshman to reply ""Nah, you can keep the egg!""",0,1390088137,null,0,false,0,ceszxrv,t3_1vgpio,t1_ceszxrv,t3_1vgpio,null,1432002204,3,false,Wales,t5_2qhrl,3

I mean anything at all, since we know that atheists are the smartest people ever to set foot on the earth and many famous scientists and great thinkers are indeed atheists, people far cleverer than you or I, do they have any proof?

You see this ultimately what it resolves down to the fact that  belief in God is an opinion, lack of belief in God is an equal opinion. There is no proof and while there is no proof both views are equally valid. They are NULLS, unknowns. Unfortunately like Copernicus you will have to offer up proof if you want to change a believers opinion. Where's this evidence that makes you so sure. Are you guilty of believing in superstitions and theories yourself without evidence?

Until there is proof, both opinions are equallly valid.

Maybe believing in God is part of the human condition and something you simply have to accept.

I believe Gods exist. 

In peoples minds.

And while there is a single believer on this planet, God will continue to exist. 

Whether Gods exist in reality is irrelevant, the issue is about belief.

true,Lordzoot,eng-yorkshire,Leeds,"&gt;Just out of interest do you have any proof that gods dont exist?

No. This is a classic silly argument though. The burden of proof lies on the person telling me god does exist. I don't believe in the tooth fairy either - do I have to prove that the tooth fairy doesn't exist?

&gt;Therefore until there is proof, both opinions are equallly valid.

No, again, that's a silly argument. You can't just state a theory is valid because it can't be disproved.   Edit: Or should I say, you shouldn't start applying that theory like it's a fact. 

&gt;Maybe believing in God is part of the human condition and something you simply have to accept.

But it's not part of the human condition, is it, because there are many humans who don't believe in god. I can accept people choose to believe in gods. I can't accept that they force those beliefs on me, or gain privileges over me through those beliefs. See bishops in the House of Lords as just **one** example.

true,ThatKidWithTheHat,capaldi,Capaldi,"But she wasn't special. What did she do to deserve so much praise? I dont care if she was the first companion of NewWho, she wasn't the first companion. She was a whiney, entitled, teenager who started her journey with the Doctor with the expressed intention of exploiting his invitation for her own gain. She even *admitted* this! She acted as if she was entitled to be on the Doctor's arm, evidenced by the fact that she acted appalled by Sarah Jane's return, and even more appalled when the Doctor was happy to see her again.
She was shallow, willing to drop her loving boyfriend like yesterday's trash after meeting not only the Doctor, but Adam and later Jack. And the truth is there may have been some romantic tension between her and the Doctor at one point, but he ultimately made the conscious decision to essentially banish her from his own dimension, and went on to have his own affairs and get married twice! And yet, the fans persist in saying that Rose was the
 quintessential companion, despite repeatedly being shown several *canonical* instances of indication that Rose was absolutely no different than any other person the Doctor has come into contact with. 

Moffat himself has laughed at the very thought that Rose was somehow more special than, say, Donna. He thought it was even funnier that people were saying the Doctor was being unfaithful to Rose.  I believe he said something along the lines of ""Susan's grandmother is going to be even more upset than Rose would be!"" 

I'm not denying the fact that the Doctor may have fancied her once. But she certainly wasn't the first, she certainly won't be the last, and she is **not** special, and the fandom needs to realize that.

You've been propagandised to to believe that the state is the only way to have a functioning society but yet you complain when the state doesn't give you what you think you deserve.

Just wrote a piece on the title 'does fracking cause dangerous earthquakes?' So this may be of some use. 

The potential dangers of fracking are there, obviously pumping water into the earth will cause rock to fracture (hence the name hydraulic fracturing), causing earthquakes. Commercial shale fracking produces earthquakes no larger than a magnitude moment of 2 (roughly 1.2 on the Richter scale and similar to a large truck passing). So it is very unlikely for your house to collapse or even for it to be felt.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I was really only pointing out that your comparison is flawed because outside circumstances have directly prevented 2 players from playing and the other two were never going to have an important role this season from the off.  You're bringing up something that is a little different than what I was speaking pointing out, but still quite relevant.

BR has spent a reported [£94.7mil](http://www.lfchistory.net/Transfers/ByManager/25-1) and made a reported [£41.6mil](http://www.lfchistory.net/Transfers/ByManager/25-0) through players in and out of the club in his time here for a net spend of £53.1mil.  Considering the way the squad was when he inherited it and how much the wage bill has probably changed after offloading the likes of Cole, Carroll, Downing, Reina, Aquilani, and Maxi (to name the players likely on larger wages) I don't think he's really doing too badly in terms of his transfers.  Borini hasn't worked out and Allen has been touch and go, as well as both having injury problems.  Aspas has been injured, Sakho was doing great until his injury and had made himself a place in the first 11, Mignolet obviously took over for Reina and barring a few mistakes lately has been great, who knows what the deal with the Assaidi transfer was to begin with but he wasn't even that pricey, Sturridge and Coutinho have been fantastic.  Looking on that list we've really had bad luck with injuries to new signings and then the Assaidi/Borini deals obviously haven't worked out.  Allen has a role to play and has done quite well this season when getting regular time in the side, he's going to work out. BR has managed his loaned players horribly though be it because of the players themselves (Cissokho and Moses) or because he was stubborn about adapting his system to fit one (Sahin... obviously an outstanding footballer and would have been worth accommodating IMO BR got this one very wrong).  The only expensive signing that has really flopped for BR so far is Borini.  Allen hasn't quite lived up to his price tag but he's been effective when he's been fit and he's finding himself more and more as time goes on.  Not every transfer will be a homerun and to have just 1 player really not do well out of 6 who were bought for £8.5mil or more (using Coutinho as the cheapest of our expensive signings) is not that bad.

When you break it down, it hasn't been nearly as terrible as you're making it out to be.  Could it have been better: yes, definitely.  Allen could have been a homerun and Borini could have not been injured and really hit the ground running.  I personally don't like the Alberto or Ilori signings that much because I think those funds would have been much better spent on players to help us right now (though it's worth pointing out that BR himself has said the reported fee for Ilori is WAY higher than the actual fee, which helps a little bit). But it surely could have been FAR worse for us.  We're getting on ok and our new players have had injury problems that have prevented them from really adjusting as quickly as we'd like.  In many cases this means we've barely seen anything of them and it's hard to say if they'll work out or not.

&gt;No. 

And that's unfortunately where it stops. There is no proof. You suggest that believers are making the claim which infers that non-believers aren't making claims.

Yet modern ""atheism"" is predicated on a position that there are no gods. Which is a belief, a view, a perspective, an argument, a position. It's all of those things. If it was simpky a lack of belief then you wouldn't care about Gods.

Modern Atheists do indeed believe that there are no Gods, to deny that is weaselly, sneaky word play. The truth in reality is you don't believe in Gods because you believe Gods dont exist. So Im asking you for evidence to back up that position.

&gt; This is a classic silly argument though. The burden of proof lies on the person telling me god does exist. I don't believe in the tooth fairy either - do I have to prove that the tooth fairy doesn't exist?

Reducing religious belief to the tooth fairy ignores the fact that belief in Gods has been endemic to the human condition throughout history. 

&gt;&gt;Therefore until there is proof, both opinions are equallly valid.

&gt;No, again, that's a silly argument. You can't just state a theory is valid because it can't be disproved.   Edit: Or should I say, you shouldn't start applying that theory like it's a fact. 

Your view is no more valid than anyone elses without proof.
Copernicus proved that the planets revolved around the sun and changed humanitys perception on the universe. Noone has yet even come close to proving Gods dont exist. Without proof its merely conjecture. 

Of course there is Dawkins and his quasi-scientific reasoning nonsense but again that is just about changing peoples opinions, even dawkins cannot offer up any proof whatsoever.


&gt;&gt;Maybe believing in God is part of the human condition and something you simply have to accept.

&gt;But it's not part of the human condition, is it, because there are many humans who don't believe in god. I can accept people choose to believe in gods. I can't accept that they force those beliefs on me, or gain privileges over me through those beliefs. See bishops in the House of Lords as just **one** example.

Fake oppression isnt really that impressive. You arent being oppressed, the victim card isnt working. In the UK you get the same rights as everyone else and your rights to freedom of thought is protected legally.

&gt;&gt;You don't believe, others choose to.

&gt;Utterly irrelevant to the discussion at hand.

The slo-mo shows contact which I can now say it was a penalty. However, even though I thought it was simulation before, I still thought it a penalty. 

I think of it this way, if you take this further back down the field and replace the keeper with a defender, then play the situation back you get the following. Suarez runs forward and a sliding tackle comes flying in. Suarez knocks the ball around the man and either side-steps or hurdles the tackle with no contact, but he loses the ball in the process. Even though there was no contact, Suarez has been impeded and lost the ball by what would be classified as a late challenge. That in my book is then a foul. 

So even before I saw the contact, Guzan has come sliding out and suarez not only has to try and knock the ball away from him but then avoid him, in the process he would have lost the ball. He goes down (remember this is me thinking he wasn't touched) almost as an emphasis to the point and so it is a penalty anyway. 

I am just surprised the ref gave it considering he didn't give one of the 3 or 4 fouls on Suarez in the first half and never stopped play for his head injury.

true,rydleo,null,null,"The thing of it is, I really do genuinely like all of the players BR has brought in, including Borini, Allen, Alberto, etc.  But it is difficult to say that any, outside of Sturridge, has really been overly important and in some ways I guess it just seems that BR is buying a bit too much of like for like to me.  

 -  Coutinho started off well and has loads of potential, but he's not been great for awhile.  I guess I would have personally just stuck with Suso and see how he got on if we were in the market for a young, promising attacking mid type.

 -  Borini seems a decent 3rd striker to have around (assuming he's willing to sit on the bench), but then why bring in Aspas and loan out Borini?  For me, I would have just kept Borini and saved 9M.

 - We basically traded Shelvey + 2M or so for Alberto.  Again, I think Alberto has a lot of potential, but he needs to be playing if he's to reach it and I don't know that he's worth the loss of Shelvey plus a few million.  Sitting on the bench he isn't anyway.

 - Why bring in Moses and send Assaidi on loan?  I agree that in theory Moses should be better than Assaidi, but he's really not been.  Trying not to flog BR for that one too much as I don't think anyone expected Moses to be so poor.

 - Why bring in Cisshoko and send Robinson on loan?  I would have personally just stuck with Robinson.

 - Reina v. Mignolet.  I really, really like Mignolet as a person and he's a brilliant shot stopper from open play.  But he's very weak on corners and crosses and, given that's one of our general weaknesses in defense, I do think we should have tried to get someone who was a bit stronger in this category (personally I would have spent the extra 5M or so and gotten Begovich).  Honestly, I know Reina looked like he could be off so I guess the idea was we needed to do something, but I'm not convinced Mignolet is really all that much better than Reina.

 - Ilori made little sense if he's not meant to play.  He didn't even make the bench today and that was with no other CB (except Kelly, I suppose) available.  He may end up being a bargain and I hope in a couple of years he's amazing, but right now, at this point in time with a limited budget, he's not what we needed.

I could go on, but my point isn't to blast the players we have as again, I do like them and hope they all go on to have amazing careers at Liverpool- all I'm trying to say, probably poorly, is that when the manager spends near enough 100M in 3 windows, the owners are going to expect a return on that investment.  Given the clear target is a top 4 spot and that almost none of the 100M in players are actually playing, I do think BR is going to have some serious tap dancing to do with Henry and Werner.  If we don't make top 4, I really don't see him making it through the summer, to be honest.

This might be a somewhat controversial view, but I also think there are very important lessons to be learnt from some aspects of religion, and far too many people disregard that in an almost militant way. It's so pervasive in human culture that it seems it *must* serve some sort of purpose. I can't say for sure what that purpose is, or whether that role has been superseded by other aspects of modern culture, but my intuition is that it hasn't entirely, although this is getting into very muddy waters.

No they won't. The DECC have only allowed three chemicals to be used, polyacrylamide (friction reducer), hydrochloric acid, and a biocide all of which are in concentrations no more than 100ths of a percent.

&gt; You'll have to elaborate.

The bore holes consist of triple skin steel pipe with a special concrete between each skin with the concrete being analysed fully before the next skin of steel is put in. The pipes are designed to last for hundreds of years.

&gt;  If not, why was the project shut down?

It was shut down temporarily whilst the DECC sought advice from the British Geological Survey and Keele University which deemed it OK. The UK has hundreds of such tremors every year so was it caused by fracking or not?

&gt; Ah, so you're not talking about modern-style fracking?

I'm talking about hydraulic fracking. Its the same thing. I've given you a location so off you go and get some stories found.

They need a supporting cast who can maintain possession and keep moving the ball with them, and I just don't think we have the players right now around them to maximise what Bannan and Joniesta can do. Our best chance to win games right now is what we're doing; using players like Jedi, Dikgacoi, Guedioura and Ward to bog down and disrupt the midfield, while relying on Puncheon, Bolasie and Chamakh for the moments of class and creativity which we need for goals. Bannan and Joniesta just aren't true ball winners in the middle of the park, and that's what we need from our midfield right now.

If we can stay in the Prem, we'll get the kind of financial resources to build a team which can play to the strengths of our more exciting players- the long term deal recently given to Joniesta amply demonstrates our commitment to doing so- but if we try and beat established premiership teams at their own game with the players we have now, we're going to get played off the park again and again until we're propping up the bottom for good.

You may be right, if we're to make the step up in how we play once we're more established, we may have to move on from Pulis.

This was not the case as Gerrard was dragged out of position left and right chasing runners. 

We were simply over run in midfield, I think Rodgers got abit excited and wanted to play with all his attacking toys at one time and neglected the balance of the side. The addition of Allen or Lucas ahead of couthino or sturridge would have seen a more fluid side. 

There is no way Rodgers was going to change the team or formation until half time. Taking couthino off after 30mins would have shattered what little confidence the lad has after a string of poor performances.

As we've discussed elsewhere, yesterday's video states that the companies have admitted that this restriction only relates to the exploratory drills, for the full drills they intend to use the full US style chemical cocktail that is slickwater, and they expect to get permission to do so (given the current political climate where fracking is priority numero uno and the politicians and regulators seem to have been heavily compromised, I see no reason to think the fracking cos have it wrong).

During the game a lot of times Suarez starts to make a good run and then a shitty pass by someone. Liverpool drew that game as a group, not thanks to Cisskoho. I would say that Kolo and Skrtel partnership is more troubling than Cissokho + Sakho and Agger or Skrtel.

During the summer Liverpool should sell Johnson, he is getting older and if he could but some good performances in during the end of the season then we might get decent money for him.

The Communications Act 2003 section 127, see Stones 8.30110B, covers the sending of improper messages. Section 127(1)(a) relates to a message etc that is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character and should be used for indecent phone calls and emails.
Also check section 5 and 4a public order acts which say words to the effect of insulting, disorderly, inproper and very vague and ambiguous terms. UK legislation is full of it, we are a nanny state and free speech was destroyed years ago.

true,Ajzzz,null,null,"&gt; As Dawkins told an audience in Dublin, “horrible as sexual abuse no doubt was, the damage was arguably less than the long-term psychological damage inflicted by bringing the child up as Catholic in the first place”.

Why are these people such liars? Dawkins was talking about a letter sent to him by a woman who said that a priest molested her as a child, but that she had far more damage inflicted on her when she was indoctrinated to believe that her non-Christian friend was being tortured in the worst ways imaginable for eternity. She was hurt and had nightmares for a long time, it was her assessment that it was worse than being molested.

People seem to forget that in the recent past it wasn't uncommon for the mainstream churches like the Roman Catholic Church to teach about hell. Now people act as if that never happened, in a few decades are they going to act as if the Church didn't ignore and protect paedophiles, not telling authorities, silencing witnesses, and moving them around to commit crimes elsewhere?

true,[deleted],null,null,"There's absolutely ZERO reason to think it was an honour killing - the boy was three (i.e., he wasn't a woman who had slept with a man of a different religion, or someone who had committed another crime), and their family was already ""dysfunctional"" (the first three kids were by a Nigerian father who the mother was married to but separated from, while the twins had a Pakistani father who they had no contact with), and there's no indication of any reason to think there was any connection to ""honour killing"" other than the fact that they were ""foreign"".

The family apparently lived in that house up until 18 months ago, so they had strong ties to it, and it's very possible that an accident happened while they were at that house and the mother tried to hide it. Alternatively they could have been staying in the house while the owner (the aunt?) was away or any number of other possibilities.

The reason given that Mikaeel was in a room by himself that night was that he was ill, which is supported by the fact he was off nursery school (unless you think that was also part of the premeditation, to cause more suspicion around his death?). The police were still saying that he had ""gone missing on Wednesday night"" in press releases this evening, which I doubt they would have said if his body had been in the woods for a week or two.

I actually think that Mikaeel died in an accident or through some form of neglect, that the mother then tried to cover up (possibly with the help of a relative), and that the rest of the family didn't know. I don't think it was murder, certainly not premeditated because I think the circumstances surrounding it don't make sense for that - someone obviously either cracked and tipped the police off, or there was a really obvious reason for the body to be where it was, if it was premeditated (especially as an honour killing), I doubt a family member would have tipped the police off. Also, I doubt he would have been kept off nursery, because that actually aroused more suspicion, and they might have attempted to make it look like someone broke into the house or something.

As it is, it's possible his flu actually killed him and the mother panicked, or it's possible she gave him an overdose of medicine, or it was actual murder but related to her getting depressed/annoyed/whatever, or one of his siblings was involved, or a whole host of other things, but I think that honour killing is somewhere around the least likely of the list of possibilities.",0,1390105024,null,0,false,0,cet64eu,t3_1vjzis,t1_cet64eu,t1_cet2sds,null,1432005283,24,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,24

true,reality_bites,null,null,"Some of it is luck, some of it is taking the chance and changing careers when you are unhappy. I won't lie, it is scary changing careers. I've done it three times, and each time was a leap of faith, and each change helped define who I am. I never knew what I wanted to be, and to be honest I still don't.

My first ""real"" job was working on an ambulance in rural Canada, it was exciting initially, but I really didn't like living in a rural location, so I looked at the career options and felt that being an accountant offered the flexibility and intellectual challenge I was missing. So I went back to school for a two year program, and I enjoyed most of the courses. I learned a lot about how a business runs, and worked for a few years as an accountant. After about five years I realized that I did not enjoy the routine and sameness of that profession. So I went back to school and spent two years learning about IT. 

This wasn't just another random change, my first accounting job was with a small business and I ended up looking after the IT infrastructure. So while I was working as an accountant, I discovered something that I did like to do. Instead of taking that information and acting on it, I went to another accounting job, that was all accounting and hated it.

So I graduated and got an IT job with the provincial government. I've been there for eight years, and my last day was on Friday. I learned that I like to do operations in IT, my job where I was, did not have a lot of operations in it. It was more overseeing the outsourcing firms that had been hired. So in about a week I'm taking another leap and starting at a private firm. I'm leaving an alright pension and a very stable environment for the unknown. I'm apprehensive, and I don't know how this will turn out, but I know I had to make a change and take another chance. It's not easy, I'm in my 40s and I'm giving up a set pension for possibly more money, but that's not guaranteed. I have a good 20-30 years of work ahead of me, and where I was I wasn't learning and becoming better at what I wanted to do. I could only discover what I wanted to do, because I was in a situation where I knew I wasn't happy. That being said, I have met some great people and will be continue to see them.

I don't hold myself up as a model of what you should do, I'm in Canada, and the situation is most likely very different in the UK. I also don't have the same level of income that someone who stuck it out in one career would have, but I have enough money to meet my needs. Looking back at everything I have done, I can say I have no regrets. I am where I am, because of what I have done before.

Your life is a narrative, with many ups and downs. Sometimes it's hard to see where you are going, but you have to keep pushing forward and try different things. You won't know what you like until you've actually tried it.

I do wish you good luck, it takes a while to find what is important in life. From my viewpoint it's always the people that you meet in life that become important. When you meet those people who you connect with, make sure you keep cultivating those relationships. In the end it's the only thing that really counts.",0,1390111590,null,0,false,0,cet8beg,t3_1vdlzs,t1_cet8beg,t3_1vdlzs,null,1432006217,3,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,3

                           Allen Hendo(c)
                        Ibe Alberto Sterling
                              Aspas

**Bench:** Ward, Sahko, Johnson, Rossiter, Brannagan, Moses, Sturridge

This would be my line up. Its unlikely Rodgers will play this team because he will want to start Suarez or Sturridge, but I feel that this line up would adequately rest our most important players, and also provide oppurtunities for our youth.

**GK:** 1.Brad Jones in, 52.Danny Ward on to the bench.

**RB:** 34.Martin Kelly in for 2.Glen Johnson who drops to the bench.

**CB:** 4.Kolo Toure and 37.Martin Skrtel remain in the heart of defence. 17.Mamadou Sahko returns from injury onto the bench.

**LB:** 44.Brad Smith to make his full debut for Liverpool. Think he can be a useful player for the club and deserves another crack after coming on against Chelsea over Christmas.

**CM:** 24.Joe Allen in to partner the days captain 14.Jordan Henderson, 46.Jordan Rossiter returns to the substitutes bench.

**CAM:** 6.Luis Alberto in to play behind the striker. Performed well against Oldham in the first half. A FA Cup start will do him the world of good. 50.Cameron Brannagan returns to the bench as he was for the game against Oldham.

**LW:** 33.Jordon Ibe returns from injury to make his first competitive start for Liverpool since the 1-0 home victory over QPR at the end of last season.

**RW:** 31.Raheem Sterling retains his place. Look for him and Ibe to exploit the defence with pace and power. 12.Victor Moses remains on the bench.

**ST:** 9.Iago Aspas to start another FA Cup game, playing in front of his fellow Spaniard Alberto. The goal against Oldham will have helped his confidence, and more goals against similarly struggling opposition would be mutually beneficial. 15.Daniel Sturridge drops down to the bench.

**Subs:**

Barring injury or a shock performance from Bournemouth, these are the subs I would make:

60th Minute: 46.Jordan Rossiter on, 24.Joe Allen off
-will aid his development tremendously, and also will Allen to rest, especially if Lucas is now injured.

66th Minute: 50.Cameron Brannagan on, 31.Raheem Sterling off
-will aid his development for being in and around the first team, Sterling gets a break. Alberto will switch to the flank and Brannagan can play behind Aspas.

75th Minute: 17.Mamadou Sahko on, 4.Kolo Toure off
-will let Sahko return to the team for a 15-20 minute spell from injury. Would be beneficial to his long term fitness to get a run out. Also Kolo could do with a rest....a long one

So thats it. Thats the team. Most likely however BR will stick with the tried and true. I'd expect to see this against Bournemouth:

                              Jones
                  Kelly Toure Skrtel Cissohko
                       Gerrard Hendo
                  Sterling Alberto Moses
                            Sturridge

**Bench:** Mignolet, Johnson, Sahko, Allen, Coutinho, Ibe, Suarez

Pollock is probably the best way to meet tons of people when you first start uni. I can't talk about the food since I was in self-catered myself. Self-catered offers more independence since you make your own food, and can eat whenever you feel like it, rather than having to go at set meal times. You're with all other first years as well. Also you have a bit more privacy since you're not living with a big group of people. But they're not very social, people don't really talk to each other, so to meet people you have to be a lot more active about it. You also have to do your own cleaning in self-catered, whereas in Pollock its all done for you.

As far as which halls in Pollock are the most friendly and social, I don't think it really matters. How social they will end up being has more to do with the people that will end up in each Hall and on each floor than the house itself. Since it's a completely new group of people every year, I don't think each house retains any sort of flavour from the years previous. Again, I didn't live there so I can only give my impressions. Bathroom sharing didn't seem too bad. They're cleaned often, and there are lots of toilets on each floor so you won't end up having to wait for one except for once every once in a blue moon. If you absolutely want en-suite though, there are rooms that have it. But, they are in high demand. So, you're not guaranteed one at all. I would put at least one non en-suite option in your choices when you apply to ensure you get a room in Pollock. When I started, there wasn't enough accommodation for everyone, so some people ended up being placed in a travelodge! Not a good way to make friends haha
