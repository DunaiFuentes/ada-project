true,PeterBrett,scot-Lothian,Lothian,"&gt; Just a couple of days ago I saw a cyclist leave a perfectly serviceable, flat, well lit, clear, clean, well-built cycle lane running parallel to the road he proceeded to mount (pulling out right in front of a car, across a zebra crossing).

You have an anecdote. That's nice! ""This one time, a cyclist did something silly,"" is not particularly useful in this debate.

There are several possible reasons that the decision may have been made:

* There may have been broken glass or other debris on the path that you were at the wrong angle to see.
* At the end of the road, the ""natural reconnection"" with the road may have placed the cyclist in a dangerous or inconvenient position (for example, it's common to be expected to simultaneously see and give way to traffic coming from three directions at such a point).
* At the end of the road, the cyclist may have wished to turn right, but the position to which the cycle lane would have delivered him might have only been suitable for turning left.
* At the end of the road, the cycle lane may have placed the cyclist in a position where he would have had to wait a long time for priority, whereas on the road proper he would be able to proceed quickly.
* The surface of the cycle path may have been unserviceable. I know of several facilities near where I live that *look* just fine, but when you try and ride down them it feels like you've just applied a pneumatic drill to your crotch.

Overall, though, the fact that the cyclist made a stupid and dangerous manoeuvre indicates that he is probably a silly cyclist, and as such observing his behaviour provides *no information whatsoever* about whether sensible cyclists would use the facilities.",0,1407855611,null,0,false,0,cjo39z1,t3_2d7wh5,t1_cjo39z1,t1_cjo2tbo,null,1435198906,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

At the moment I am volunteering at the local Citizens Advice and they also push people toward the service with self referral packs. Obviously when you are depressed and feeling worthless and feel unmotivated even doing the form can seem like hell. If you aren't feeling too anxious around people it might be an idea to go to your local citizens advice to get someone to sit and do it with you for motivation. I know that when I was going through it all I kept it secret from everyone and still feel quite embarressed so doing it with a stranger might help in that regard.

I'm not sure what other services are like around the country but I hope their are other Trent PTS style set ups. I guess the only way to find out is to talk to the GP.

true,Rome_Leader,1905,Frank Lampard,"I live in Canada, and I have many, many shirts. They are expensive, but also I'm opposed to fakes on principle.

My solution is the following: www.classicfootballshirts.co.uk

They really are a top bunch of dudes, with shirts that go well back into the anals of the club's history. You can usually pick up a fairly recent jersey that's in great condition, and they often sell a great deal of name and numbered ones. Always authentic, and a good bit cheaper usually since they are older and pre-worn. You can get even cheaper if you don't mind it being a little big. I'm a medium but have bought larges and even XLs before that are much cheaper due to the supply, especially if it's an older print with a name I really want. If you want a current season jersey, you'd probably have to wait, though.

What's even better is that their shipping is fantastic, esp. to Canada and I know from experience. 10 pounds flat fully insured and you can track it, and never pay duty like you would if it came from America. Once, they even sent me the wrong shirt by mistake (2007-08 Away instead of 2003-05 away), let me keep that shirt, and sent me the right one free of charge! They make a little off mark-ups (sold them a Malaga top from 99-00 that I found in a thrift store for five bucks for 12.50 pounds - they posted it for 17.50 I believe?), but most/all their shirts come from fans who sell them back when they no longer want them.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; You have an anecdote. That's nice! ""This one time, a cyclist did something silly,"" is not particularly useful in this debate.

I could tell you about the daily cyclists I see ignoring the same strip - presumably you feel they all have some mitigating excuse. Let's look through some of your assumptions and see:

* Broken glass / debris... 

No. Bright sunny day, I could see very clearly. 

* At the end of the road, the ""natural reconnection"" 

No. A safe junction into traffic and whilst looking to check for traffic would be necessary - it was just as necessary when the cyclist crossed the pavement/zebra crossing into the road. They didn't look then either, FWIW. 

* At the end of the road, the cyclist may have wished to turn right

Impossible on this road - no right turn. It crosses or joins with a dual carriageway depending so left or straight on are the only options. 

* At the end of the road, the cycle lane may have placed the cyclist in a position where he would have had to wait a long time for priority. 

Given the amount of traffic - not really. Though given the cyclists who cross red lights or zebra crossings with people on them, perhaps 'a long time' is subjective? 

* The surface of the cycle path may have been unserviceable. 

Nope. I've ridden it, it's fine. 

&gt; Overall, though, the fact that the cyclist made a stupid and dangerous manoeuvre indicates that he is probably a silly cyclist, and as such observing his behaviour provides no information whatsoever about whether sensible cyclists would use the facilities.

If a sufficient number of cyclists act as this one did (and he's not the only one to use the road over the cycle lane provided, despite its suitability) then why bother making special provision? What possible benefit is it, when it's 50/50 whether anyone will bother to use it? 

In the interests of safety and easing traffic congestion I'd suggest it's mandatory to use cycle lanes where it's possible to do so unless some obstruction prevents this. Obstructing a cycle lane is a separate issue and should be equally enforced against. 

Certainly it should be mandatory that cyclists adhere to the same rules of the road as everyone else where traffic lights / zebra crossings / pavements / road joining are concerned. 

I think my main condensed point here is that the price of good infrastructure should be adherence to it and to the rules of the road. I'm seeing neither in so many cyclists that it's hard to sympathise, even though I *am* a bike rider myself. 

Instead of seeing cyclists holding their hands up in fairness saying 'we're not perfect, but we're trying to get the bad cyclists to be better' it's usually 'but motorists are worse'. There's zero responsibility being taken until they're really pushed on it. 

It shouldn't have to come to that to see a little responsibility from cyclists. ",0,1407856628,null,0,false,0,cjo3rnz,t3_2d7wh5,t1_cjo3rnz,t1_cjo39z1,null,1435199137,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Sadly Video Games are a great example, 10 years ago making friends through gaming was impossible to avoid, now because of matchmaking and everything being go go go now now now, making friends is impossible. 

Combine this with all the constant negative news forcing people to fear each other, no one wants to make friends.

I think it's just about whether or not people want friends, and the way society is teaching everyone to be afraid of others, less and less people want that real personal interaction, when they can just get on Fakebook and pretend they have 400 friends even though they never speak to any of those people.

So, whilst you'll find no bigger advocate for increasing mental health funding through the roof. The problem is 'get help' just is not good enough at the moment. Because the help, despite it being provided by many well intentioned people is just not good enough. We have treatments of often very low efficacy and no cures. For things that are like everything else pathologies, but of the mind. Itself a real concrete thing of neurons and electrical circuits. 

Sure getting over the 'stigma' is great, but we've made big strides there allready, and I worry that thinking thats the only hurdle ignores the second one.

All of our treatments of severe mental illnesses are still at a very, very infantile stage. Psychotherapy when it has some bite unfortunately often requires the sufferer to buy into fairly egocentric world views that can be shattered quite easily (or just don't work on people relatively cynical by nature). On the other hand the regimen of blasting with drugs has exhausted all effective options (often it just doesn't take), well that leaves the person feeling at the end of the road with will power alone.

We need better treatments, drastically better treatments like comparing Sulfonamide  to Penicillin levels of better - for that we need to understand the entire structure of human cognition on its most basic level.

For that money needs to be thrown at cog sci. Current we are very iffy globally on this. ",0,1407859000,null,0,1407864864,0,cjo4zn9,t3_2dbviv,t1_cjo4zn9,t3_2dbviv,null,1435199713,45,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,45

Then this circlejerk gets picked up by opposing fans who have no idea what shape our squad is in and what we are capable of. We proved how well we can play without Suarez in pre-season, but of course, pre-season doesn't matter guys!

No one yet has given me a solid point as to why we will struggle to get top 4. Champions League games keep coming up as an excuse, but have they seen the size of our squad? Only concern that this whole sub voices and I agree with is that we lack depth in our strikers. That's about it. We can comfortably rotate our squad that we play our best 11 come CL and then have good enough squad to beat Aston Villa or whoever we would face the same week. 

Last season we missed so many of our ""star"" players, yet managed just fine. Gerrard, Suarez, Coutinho, Sturridge and many more were out for 5+ games or something along those lines. If I remember correctly that didn't stop us from thrashing lower end teams.

What's going to be different this next season? Are those teams placed 7-20 suddenly going to get immensely better? Have we gotten weaker? Win those 28 games of the lower end teams and voila, you've made top 4 again. 

But hey, if it makes pundits and non-Liverpool fans think that writing us off from making top 4 makes them football geniuses, then go ahead and write us off. If anything we will once again benefit from being underdogs and then come mid-season we will hear excuses as to why we shouldn't be doing how well we will be doing and how in the second half of the season we will REALLY feel Suarez's absence then.

Friendships do require effort, especially as you get older.

When you're young, simply liking the same band or wearing the same colour shirt is enough to have a *Best Friend For Life. LOL!!! I'm so random xxx*

But as you get older, and (generally) have more of a workload and responsibilities, it can be harder to keep those relationships going. Older people usually have an established circle of friends and they don't want new friends. Simple as that.

Sometimes you can be lucky enough to be employed somewhere with people that you'd normally be friends with, but that's not always the case. They're only your 9-to-5 work buddies, and then that's it.

I noticed that friends of mine gained a massive circle of friends when their children started going to primary school. They started to have house parties and events with a lot of other people from the same street. Before that, they hardly knew any of their neighbours. These guys weren't fabulously social people, but they found that their circle of friends increased at this point in their family life because everyone else was doing it at the same time.

But families aren't for everyone.

My trick to finding and/or maintaining friends requires effort.

**Finding:** get hobbies, get out of the house. Not just pubs, but clubs or educational events. e.g. art gallery openings, or a wine tasting course. This is the random part of finding friends. You have to increase your chances of meeting not just new people but the *right* new people.

The internet makes this part so much easier these days. Try something like this: http://uk.meetup.com/cities/gb/c3/cambridge/ (I'm in Cambridge, so I used that as an example)


**Maintaining:** This is hard but you have to be brave and try not to take rejection badly. 

My trick was to organise dinner and drinks with clusters of friends. Just 3 or 4 at a time, and slowly mix the different groups and see how the dynamic worked out. Don't be afraid to be pushy! Send out an email/txt/PM to a group of people, give them a time and place, and see who turns up. Sometimes no-one can turn up, so you have to be flexible and change the date/time/place. Keep at it!

I had a few friends who didn't drink, so I had to organise more dinner oriented meetings with these guys versus the other people. It's not too hard to find a balance.

I used to do this at least once a month with some old school buddies and some new friends. The result? People LOVED it. People love it when things are organised for them like this. People who want to do these meetups will keep going to them, others won't. ",0,1407860005,null,0,1407860379,0,cjo5ijc,t3_2dbnj7,t1_cjo5ijc,t3_2dbnj7,null,1435199960,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

&gt;

&gt;__Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester__, [KB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_of_the_Order_of_the_Bath) (3 September 1724 – 10 November 1808), known between 1776 and 1786 as __Sir Guy Carleton__, was an [Anglo-Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Irish) soldier and administrator. He twice served as [Governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor) of the [Province of Quebec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Quebec_(1763-1791\)), from 1768 to 1778, concurrently serving as [Governor General of British North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_General_of_Canada) in that time, and again from 1785 to 1795.  The title [Baron Dorchester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Dorchester) was created on 21 August 1786.

&gt;He commanded British troops in the [American War of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_War_of_Independence), first leading the [defence of Quebec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Quebec_(1775\)) during the [1775 rebel invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Canada_(1775\)) and the 1776 counteroffensive that drove the rebels from the province. In 1782 and 1783 he led as the [commander-in-chief of all British forces in North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-Chief,_North_America). In this capacity he was notable for carrying out the Crown's promise of freedom to [slaves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaves) who joined the British, and he oversaw the evacuation of British forces, [Loyalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalist_(American_Revolution\)) and more than 3,000 [freedmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedmen) from [New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City) in 1783 to transport them to a British colony.

&gt;The military and political career of his younger brother, [Thomas Carleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Carleton), was interwoven with his own, and Thomas served under him in the Canadas.

Not all cyclists are the same.  They're people, after all! A cycle facility that's completely unusable for a commuter might be perfectly suitable for a 12-year-old child on the way to school.  Good cycle provision is usable by all cyclists, but having a poor cycle path is sometimes better than not having cycle path, even if not all cyclists feel that it is appropriate to use it.

&gt; In the interests of safety and easing traffic congestion I'd suggest it's mandatory to use cycle lanes where it's possible to do so unless some obstruction prevents this.

As many, many, many people have already pointed out over, and over, and over again, this is a *stupid* idea.  The fact that you support this ridiculous idea indicates that you have no clue whatsoever about the practicalities of day-to-day cycling in the UK.

I frequently ride at a sustained 21+ mph, which is completely safe on the road but would be fatally dangerous on many of the laughable ""cycle lanes"" around here.  And even at a slow speed, there are *many* situations in which using cycle lanes is genuinely more dangerous than cycling in the carriageway.  There is no argument for mandatory cycle lanes that stands up to even the barest scrutiny.

The fact that you think this will ease traffic congestion is particularly laughable. On my way to work, it's almost invariably the cyclists who are stuck behind (or squeezing past) the motorists!

&gt; Instead of seeing cyclists holding their hands up in fairness saying 'we're not perfect, but we're trying to get the bad cyclists to be better'

Why the hell are you holding *me* responsible for the behaviour of people I don't know and over whom I have no authority. Why should I, as a third party with no ties to them at all, take responsibility for their behaviour?

true,Eschatonreddit,null,null,"Throwaway, because I know it won't be a popular sentiment. Fuck it. 

I've suffered from depression due to an upbringing of violence, sexual abuse and homelessness and I think Reddit's general attitude to depression is overly-simplistic, self-congratulatory and overly-pitying to sufferers - to a point that undermines a depressed individual's autonomous control of their own happiness. ""Oh no, you can't control it, it's an ""illness,"" you see.""

Bullshit. It can be controlled, it can be beaten and its ONLY the individual who is able to make this change. Not a Doctor, not some bored twat on the end of the Samaritans line. Certainly not Jason sodding Manford.

I've seen that Pagliacci joke from Watchmen get trotted out countless times today - tasteless and inane as it is, so no surprise that Jason Manford, a man who had no problem destroying his wife's life by cheating on her, is cynical enough to use it too. The prick.

I don't think depressed people are incapable of helping themselves, in fact I think it's only through self-actualising behaviours like CBT that depressed people can overcome their illness. I tried the Samaritans, I tried counselling, they were all utterly fucking useless. Yeah, maybe they'll help people, maybe they won't. They didn't for me. 

""The world needs you even if you don't think it does.""

Well, that's not necessarily true now, is it? It's just a cheap sentimental pile of shit, faux-pity and the mental equivalence of a wooden spoon award. Everyone who takes part gets a medal! Bollix. Not everyone is loved. When was the last time any of you went up and talked to a homeless guy, asked about his day? Most people don't give a shit about anyone but themselves or their immediate family. 

No doubt I'll be scolded for daring to not espouse the unending virtues of counselling, or Jason Manford, depending on which dipshit appears first, and that the opinion of someone who has had depression is irrelevant - well so it goes. I can take it. 

I think the wankers here going on about how all depressed people can be helped, or helped by the narrowly accepted forms that Reddit agrees with (counselling, Samaritans,) mean well but ultimately show nothing more than their own ignorance of a situation that's a bit more complex than ""Oh, you shouldn't feel guilty or unloved, we're there for you.""

The reality is that none of those things are mutually exclusive. If you were there for people more, less people would be depressed. If you loved people more, less people would be depressed. Once Robin Williams fades from memory in a couple of weeks time, none of you are going to give a shit about depression anymore, or even keep up the pretense that you ever did. 

All in all, to Jason Manford -just like your comedy, your advice is shitty dross that appeals to nobody but the lowest common denominator.

&gt; Three times in five years, Liverpool might have signed Lazar Markovic. Three times, they demurred. Damien Comolli worried that the teenager, offered to him for £2 million while he was the club’s technical director, would not be eligible for a work permit. Kenny Dalglish baulked at what he saw as an inflated price. And then Brendan Rodgers declined, mistakenly believing he had already been promised to Chelsea.

&gt; Now, at the fourth attempt, they have their man. All the signs are that he will be worth not just the money, but the wait.

&gt; To listen to the paeans of praise lavished on the 20-year-old since he first exploded into football’s consciousness at Partizan Belgrade, it would be easy to assume that Markovic has always been singled out for stardom.

&gt; He was just 17, barely out of the club’s famed Belin academy, when dozens of scouts were flocking across Europe to watch him; there were more than 20 at one Belgrade derby in his first season as a senior player.

&gt; When he was 18, Andrea Stramacci-oni, in charge of Inter Milan at the time, called him “exceptional”, waxing lyrical about his blistering acceleration. By the time he was 19, Avram Grant, briefly his coach at Partizan, claimed that “apart from [Cristiano] Ronaldo and [Lionel] Messi, he was one of the best talents” he had ever seen at that age.

&gt; Rui Costa, no mean judge of talent, described him as a “pure talent”. “His speed and skill can make a difference in the Barclays Premier League,” said the former Portuguese playmaker, now Benfica’s technical director. “He has the ability and flexibility to escape defenders easily. He is cold-blooded when he is in a one-to-one situation and he is not afraid to face opponents. He is always eager to learn. He takes risks, he likes to attack. He is a huge talent.”

&gt; His story, though, is not quite so simple. Markovic was born in Cacak, a town more renowned for producing basketball players than footballers. His father had played in Yugoslavia’s second division for the local club, Borac, and soon both of his sons — Filip, the elder by two years, and Lazar — were enrolled in Borac’s academy.

&gt; Both were quick, both nimble, both wide players who loved to cut inside. Lazar’s room was decorated with posters of his favourite team, Chelsea, and in particular with images of Gianfranco Zola, his childhood hero.

&gt; It was, though, Filip who seemed the more promising, and by the time he was 14, word had spread that deep in basketball country there was a player worth watching. Partizan dispatched Nedeljko Kostic, the head of their academy, and Sladjan Scepovic, their scout, to take a look. They were impressed. They agreed a deal with Borac, only to discover that Filip’s father insisted they sign Lazar, 12, too.

&gt; “He did not want his sons to be separated at such an early age,” explains Vladimir Novakovic, a Serbian football journalist. Their mother, a lawyer, gave up her job in Cacak to be with her boys when they made the 100-mile journey to the capital.

&gt; The move would prove to suit Lazar more than his brother. He thrived at Belin, helped in part by the searing speed that had made him such a formidable sprinter at high school that he was considered a potential professional athlete and in part by Kostic’s golden touch, his careful crafting of his young charges’ talent.

&gt; Belin has churned out the likes of Stefan Savic, Matija Nastasic and Stevan Jovetic in recent years. There was no better place for the receptive Markovic to develop.
Rui Costa described him as “focused”; Novakovic says that, apart from a red card for his part in a brawl with Mirko Vucinic, of Juventus, in last season’s Europa League semi-final, he “does not have a stain on his career, he is very well-behaved and his mother moving to Belgrade is probably the key factor in that.”

&gt; Partizan knew he would not be with them for long. Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Bayern Munich and Fiorentina all looked at him; it was widely assumed Chelsea had negotiated a first option on him with his agent, Fali Ramadani. Even when he signed for Benfica — his brother, Filip, was included in the deal — Dragan Duric, Partizan’s president, seemed to hint it was part of some sort of masterplan that would eventually take him to Stamford Bridge. Rodgers had heard the same rumour. It was enough to put him off.

&gt; Not for long, though. Markovic shone in Portugal, his effortless speed, his gliding style convincing Liverpool that he was worth one more attempt. This time, they would not be denied.

true,AgentUmlaut,null,null,"He said how he was an Academy rep/assistant coach but his stories were leaky because his name never appeared on the website which is odd since most clubs list almost every single personnel that would have those responsibilities somewhere online.

He also would follow all of the players, coaches, clubs and basically anyone with a twitter or other social media and act like he was there with them. The whole bit where he said, ""oh Borini loves watching animal videos online and allegedly liking Big Macs"" was taken from banter on twitter that was going back and forth to Borini and his girlfriend.

I remember talking to him about Football Manager and he'd bring up how he would be hanging with Joe Allen and Borini a lot. There was also the infamous bit how he allegedly ran into Henrikh Mkhitaryan in London and got an ambiguous answer about speculation over transfers, also Elevenreds joked about how he let Pepe Reina have his copy of Finding Nemo and never got it back.

Then he kept having AMAs pretending to know all this shit, his proof was a drawn up photoshopped letter of his alleged acceptance of his position with the club and I think there was a phony drawn up pay statement as well. He also got a couple of accounts banned and kept trying to make these long winded apologetic statements how he really is a staff member and how he isn't in the know of any transfers and all this other hokey stuff. Some people were duped, others started seeing the bs.

The mods here allowed him some time to produce hard evidence and he failed to do so when they set deadlines. I forgot which mod, but someone called the club asking about if anyone under the name Elevenreds gave was there(I think it was Joe or something), they said nobody had the name on the staff there but there was like an academy player with a similar name. Someone contacted him and the kid never even heard of reddit.

This and the whole finding out he was constantly using proxies to make it seem like he had a UK IP address were the final nails in the coffin. 

As far as other miscellaneous shit goes I remember when I used to talk to him a lot about just the sport in general and other stuff, he told me bs of how NYC FC contacted him to be a coach and how they'd set him up in the city. 

**TL;DR** A guy with way too much time on his hands pretended to be a Academy assistant coach, made up that he chilled with players, and did all this other stuff.

The fact is that depression is different for everyone and so is what helps. Personally, I found CBT and the ""change your thoughts in order to change your feelings"" stuff to be a supreme waste of time. However, I've called the Samaritans in a particularly low moment, and the person on the end of the phone as good as talked me back from the edge. Some people demonise antidepressants as a useless crutch that stop people from getting real help. For me, they've been an invaluable bit of extra support that have helped me be able to contemplate trying to put my life back together.


Basically, this advice isn't shit. For some, talking therapies or the Samaritans could just be a lifesaver. If I took your lead, and basically decided that everything that didn't work for me personally was a load of bollocks, then I'd call your advice shit because the CBT ""pull your socks up and get on with it"" approach was a waste of time for me. People need to find what works for them, and we shouldn't be discouraging that.

This is also the first year BR has to actually rotate his squad, something that makes and brakes top class managers, with the amount of young to teenage players we have, the potential  for mental fatigue is huge, and there is no way coutinho, sterling and markovic can stay consistent all year, there will be growing pains. 

And finally people are saying that we will make up goals with sterling and coutinho getting 10+ goals each, even seen some people quote hendo in double figures and one guy said Lovren and Skrtel score 13 between them! How can people say coutinho will score double digits when shooting is by far the weakest aspect of his game? 

And the whole stop gap argument is horrible. When did people start thinking we are in a position to ""wait"" a year for a striker and settle with etoo. Really? If we have any hope of building up Liverpool to our former glory we can't take a year off with a stop gap striker and wait to spend for next year. We have to get top 4 again, we have to.

true,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I'm not down voting you. I fucking love Pato. Unfortunately when his body broke it seems like his confidence broke a little bit too. It's hard to say if the constant muscle injuries he's had in the past few years have really disabled him or not. He seems to have lost that quick first step he used to have. That said, if his body can be sorted out and he can regain his confidence, he's an incredible player. He'd fit in nicely with us too, smart movement, hard working, good finishing, and wonderful technical ability.

I secretly dream of him recovering his form and us buying him. He's one of my favorite players. He was world class at his best and he's still so young he has plenty of time to rediscover himself.

In a small country, you don't have to worry about long-distance travel so much. Most of it will take place outside your borders, so you just need to provide terminals with sufficient capacity. For road and rail, even if your in-country infrastructure is slow (only designed for short distance journeys), it can connect to a higher-speed network outside your borders.

In a larger country, you have to spread things more evenly. You need to have actual long-distance transport links, not just a few terminals. You need complete networks of road and rail, not just a few routes with external connections.

Walking and cycling can have a very high capacity, but are only suitable for the shortest distances. Especially where terrain is difficult. (The Netherlands one of the flattest countries in Europe).

Their website is crappy and hard to translate and there isn't much out their on it. They weren't as good on women's rights as the PFLP, I don't think, but they are definitely better than Hamas. Most articles about women in the Palestinian Territory are about Hamas' treatment of them.

Homosexuality is even harder to guage and the region in general isn't very good on that front. But they would still definitely be better than an Islamist group.

&gt;I'm not sure what comparison you're trying to draw here

I'm trying to point out the solidarity involved here. You can't seem to understand why Sinn Féin would care about Palestine because they're more progressive than you think Arabs are. Fatah hold more progressive values than Hamas and there is serious bad blood between them but it doesn't stop Fatah showing solidarity with the people in Gaza and likewise with Sinn Féin.

&gt;Sure, gloss over all the stuff I said about the similarities between Jewish paramilitaries and the IRA...

The similarities between the Jewish paramilitaries from 70 years ago and the IRA from 90 years ago is completely irrelevant. You don't decide what your opinion on something happening today based on some vague similarities between two separate things decades before you were born.

I'd like to pick up on one of your points though; 

&gt; All of our treatments of severe mental illnesses are still at a very, very infantile stage.

The mind is a curious thing. I believe in the future we will begin to understand what's happening in the actual brain of a depressed person. What chemicals are being released, and why essentially it is misfunctioning. 

In the next 100yrs or so, as technological advancement continues to absolutely blast forward and at unprecedented rate, cases like this will become a thing of the past. 

I worked with a woman who had what I can only describe as a 'nervous break down', although it was a lot more than that. She was dragged into a police van laughing. What happened that day made me realise how fragile the mind is. It's like why do some people suffer from PTSD when others don't? 

These things we will gain a much greater understanding of in time. It'll help depressed people or people with any mental illness to function a lot better.

I went through a phase of lashing out when picked-upon by drunk people, but that was when I was in my teens and just generally insecure about those sorts of things. Drunk people do make for excellent tormentors when they're in a group and think they have the advantage in numbers - I hope you never have to be on the receiving end of it. Its grim.

The problem is that the sober person has to make the decision to be mute, or else they'll inevitably say something disagreeable, and inebriated folk are much less willing to forgive and forget, even over the most trivial issue that wouldn't even register if everybody was sober. So people who drink never invite non-drinkers because they think that non-drinkers will start preaching and making a scene, whilst non-drinkers are scared away because they know that even if they never complain once, they simply don't want to deal with any of it.

Of course, my impression is built upon having spent time with thoroughly unreasonable drunks. I really do hope that there are non-drinkers out there who get to go to pubs on a friday evening and still feel welcomed. More likely than not we become just a shadow that slips through the cracks.

and..

I honestly don't know, thats the problem.

I think people being open about mental illnesses being illnesses, pathologies like any other is good. The stigma around that has caused untold problems for generations. 

But.. and its a big 'But'. If the psychotherapy doesn't take (and i'm really not a fan, as i've said of the way it fundamentally works some times - especially when the causes come down to extreme trauma's), which it often doesn't. if the particular pathology can't be treated or mitigated with fairly brute force drugs. 

Then again, your left thinking 'well that's it for me'. I think what a lot of people might be missing it that, whilst a lot of suicides are sudden. A huge amount are not, long suffering conditions, normally of the combination of PTSD and chronic depression.

There's no hope that completely new treatments may be over the horizon, at least to the sufferer. I mean there has been some ground gained in immediate after affect treatments of rape and other PTSD inducing events. But otherwise, thats really about it. 

Nothing about these conditions are fundamentally incurable. At the end of the day it'll all come down to specific groups of neuronal circuits that'll be causing the thoughts, the ruminations, the memories or the larger chemical imbalances. 

As i've said, the real key to all this is the search for the physical underpinnings of consciousness, a field of science, for its potential benefit to mankind and the complexity of the task - that is scandalously underfunded. That's the real underlying problem. Which I don't think is being addressed... and sadly won't be. 

Indeed, for a lot of people this whole issue, brought up by the tragic case of Mr. Williams, will remain in the zietguiest of just 'well he didn't seek help'.

He, like her, did seek help. For many years. It didn't work. And it didn't work because its just not nearly good enough in far too many cases.

&gt;No one yet has given me a solid point as to why we will struggle to get top 4. Champions League games keep coming up as an excuse, but have they seen the size of our squad? Only concern that this whole sub voices and I agree with is that we lack depth in our strikers. That's about it. We can comfortably rotate our squad that we play our best 11 come CL and then have good enough squad to beat Aston Villa or whoever we would face the same week. 

1.Cpl things, you can't say we will comfortably rotate our squad when this is BR's first true year of managing squad rotation. 
2.Our squad depth isn't really that good, Compared to other champions league squads.
3. Naive to say we can mop up the Lower table sides when everyone has been strengthening because of the new TV money. And us seemingly unable to do so over the past 5 years.
4. Tottenham and Newcastle are going to surprise people this year.
5. LvG has stated that his sole focus is on the premiere league campaign, that's worrying.
6. We have a lot of players sub 21 years of age and burnout is a worrying factor with playing 50+ games this year, especially if we are relying on sterling and coutinho for the majority of the campaign. 
7. Our backup strikers (if we get etoo) our both 32+



&gt;What's going to be different this next season? Are those teams placed 7-20 suddenly going to get immensely better? Have we gotten weaker? Win those 28 games of the lower end teams and voila, you've made top 4 again. 

As of now you can't win an argument against someone saying Chelsea, city and arsenal are locked for top 4 ( yes I realize it's preseason, talking on paper). So who is going to get that 4th spot out of Liverpool, Tottenham and united? I think we can do it but only if we get a decent striker and pull off some butt clenching victories. 

We have gotten weaker you can't replace Suarez and you can't mitigate his contributions to our team in just a year. My worry is that this summer we needed to make a presence be ballsy and put ourselves in the strongest position we could so we could go for top 4 again, I think the approach we took instead was to be a little too smart for our own good (one of BRs faults) by cleverly starting to build Liverpool 2.0 ,but, be it missing out on signings or naivety, we went ahead with our summer plans forgetting how important that top class striker is to our system. I think we screwed up this summer and are currently, desperately trying to find a short term fix for either January or next summer and hope that our top targets are available this time.


I think if we don't sign a striker BR will drop us out of the cup games early to shed some games, give a good try in CL but not get passed the group stages and focus on the league, top 4 is the only thing we must accomplish again.",0,1407864735,null,0,false,0,cjo84ew,t3_2dbq3y,t1_cjo84ew,t1_cjo595t,null,1435201190,-2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-2

you've gotta think that this constant deprecation (self-inflicted or not) can't do anything but hurt the club when it comes to attracting new supporters. prefacing a preview by saying something along the lines of ""if you hate yourself, pick this team"" is awful. wish we could work on fixing this mopey, down-trodden image of the club. obviously i'm only exposed to a very small corner of the media, but this mindset almost always comes through.

true,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,"It's been attempted here [also](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1907_Belfast_Dock_strike)

&gt; The strike was characterised by unrest in working class areas of Belfast and solidarity across the sectarian divide. Given that Protestants made up the majority of Belfast's workforce, most of the strikers and local strike leaders were in fact, Protestants, although Catholics comprised a significant number. Specifically, three-quarters of Belfast's carters and three-fifths of its dockers were Protestants.[7]
&gt; 
&gt; **That July Belfast experienced the most unusual Twelfth ever witnessed before or since. Instead of the traditional rioting and sectarian clashes which typically accompanied the Orange Order parades, the strike leaders gave public speeches defending the workers' interests against all forms of sectarianism.[8]**
&gt; 
&gt; On the Shankill Road, a Protestant area of the city and a regular scene of sectarian clashes, on 26 July 100,000 workers marched in support of the strike in a parade that featured flute bands from both Unionist and Nationalist traditions, a very rare occurrence.[9] The parade ended at a mass rally held outside City Hall, where 200,000 demonstrators had gathered.[10]
&gt; 
&gt; Although it involved members of both the Protestant and Catholic communities, the Irish Unionist Alliance establishment opposed the strike and subjected Larkin to a sectarian campaign of condemnation, aimed largely at coaxing Protestant workers away from the strike.[11] Larkin did however secure the support of the Independent Orange Order, an offshoot of the mainstream Orange Order which at the time had close ties to the Protestant labour movement",0,1407864908,null,0,false,0,cjo87xs,t3_2dcjq0,t1_cjo87xs,t1_cjo7w5u,null,1435201249,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

Thank you, but please as i've said. Let's not make this about me.

&gt;In the next 100yrs or so, as technological advancement continues to absolutely blast forward and at unprecedented rate, cases like this will become a thing of the past.

As some, who as It happens also did a bit of cog sci back in uni, it doesn't even need to be 20. It's a hugely complex problem sure. But the issue is there are just not enough centers, and just not enough funding being directed at it.

Part of this comes down to the fact that, in much of medicine go back even 20-30 years and what im suggesting would have been seen as unscientific quakery. Largely because notions of understanding consciouenss, were considered too fluffy and without the tools to meaningfully study or replicate human cognition it was simply seen as the province for empty philosophy (at best), not science.

That has MASSIVELY changed since then. Proper Functional MRI studies started to really get off the ground in the 1990'ies, and mostly driven by reserch money being focused towards pratical application, we know actually understand our visiual system, really quite well.

But the idea of the wider system of the mind being a machine to understand like any-other, is still unpalatable and the fundamental stumbling block still is that if you wanted a grant to work on trying to build basic units of cognition in humans. There are maybe 5 departments in the world you could even try to work at (let alone actually work at). All of them doing Stirling work (these guys for example are heroes: http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sackler/ ), don't get me wrong and i've been out of the loop for a bit so its probably going up. There is one  new center starting up a believe but im struggling even to find anything on it (again a good indication of the real problem at hand).

But the money just is not there. Partly because the sort of stance im taking now, would be academic suicide to suggest as a research path money should be given for.

It also didn't help that pseduo-scientific quackery and Crystal hugging bullshit has seriously muddied the water. It's a pity there's not a hell for people like Chopra to go to for the harm he's done to the acceptability of research into this. 

The public arn't even aware its a thing, politicans don't care. Far too much of it is seen as either too complex and too early to really get on board with, or pointless unscientific goose cases for 'the soul'. This is all just wrong. 

But if money was thrown at this, actual cures may not be completely out of reach in our lifetimes. ",0,1407865467,null,0,1407865699,0,cjo8j9t,t3_2dbviv,t1_cjo8j9t,t1_cjo7nvw,null,1435201474,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; Not all cyclists are the same. They're people, after all! 

You're just as content to make sweeping statements about *your experiences* with motorists. You can't have it both ways. 

&gt;  A cycle facility that's completely unusable for a commuter might be perfectly suitable for a 12-year-old child on the way to school.

And it's times like that that I think 'deal with it'. The world is never going to be 100% to people's liking but when there are so many cyclists complaining about this, that and the other - perhaps some will never be pleased and just want something to moan about. The cycle lane in my example for instance is absolutely fine for all age groups and types of bike. 

&gt; As many, many, many people have already pointed out over, and over, and over again, this is a stupid idea. 

You're disagreeing with some of your comrades on wheels then. It'd be great to know why beyond your interest in your own abilities (as you said, people are people - cyclists aren't all the same). 

&gt; I frequently ride at a sustained 21+ mph, which is completely safe on the road but would be fatally dangerous on many of the laughable ""cycle lanes"" around here. 

Why. You're doing what I see many cyclists do - make bland statements about their own grand ability vs. the total inadequacy of... everything. Roads. Cycle Lanes. Motorists. Other cyclists. The colour purple. *Give reasons.*

Furthermore if it's dangerous to do such speeds in some conditions *then don't do those speeds*. Bloody hell - you can't be so retarded as to think that just because you *can* do something doesn't mean that you *should*. You're aware that most cars can do 70mph+, but many turns would be fatal at that speed?... 

&gt; The fact that you think this will ease traffic congestion is particularly laughable. On my way to work, it's almost invariably the cyclists who are stuck behind (or squeezing past) the motorists!

You do realise that you just *confirmed* what I said? If you're not stuck behind the motorists, *you're not congested!*

Further more on *my* trip to work it's frequently my bus that is stuck behind slow moving cyclists - some of whom refusing to use the provided cycle lane which results in not enough space for the bus to pass - so we all back up behind the cyclist. Brilliant. 

&gt; Why the hell are you holding me responsible for the behaviour of people I don't know and over whom I have no authority.

You brought up motorists with me earlier as though I was supposed to explain them. As I mentioned earlier in this post, you can't have it both ways. 

Furthermore even if you're not directly responsible you can at least acknowledge the failings of a peer group. You *are* a cyclist and you're writing to defend them. Does that make you incapable of acknowledging the failings of other cyclists? No. Is it relevant to how cyclists are perceived and how provisions are made for them? Yes.

&gt; How can you possibly rationalise this point of view? It makes no sense. ""Cyclists"" are not a collective.

You are aware that generalisations occur for a reason? 

The well known tale of the 'arrogant white van man' or 'tailgating BMW/Audi driver' spawned from people slowly but surely noticing that it was white van men who drove a certain way - not other car types, but white van men. BMW's got noticed as the kind of car that was always tailgating because that's how a noticeable percentage chose to drive them. 

If cyclists start to get noticed as selfish, arrogant, dangerous, pedestrian endangering red light jumpers then *that is how you will be thought of in the first instance, even if you personal are not amongst this camp*. 

That might seem horribly unfair but welcome to the world - where people do come to those conclusions. Fact is I don't just mean *me* there. I mean a lot of people. Why? Because cyclists across the country are ignoring road laws and cycling as they see fit. Like it or not - assuming you're not amongst them - they're tarring you with a bad brush.

true,Rukooo,lfc99,,"&gt; 1. Cpl things, you can't say we will comfortably rotate our squad when this is BR's first true year of managing squad rotation. 

Not true. In the league last year we had one different variations of starting 11 in the league. He managed rotating the squad just fine when injuries started to hit.

&gt;  Our squad depth isn't really that good, Compared to other champions league squads.

Yes because Arsenal had such good squad depth last year. Man Utd have amazing squad depth this year as well right?

&gt; Naive to say we can mop up the Lower table sides when everyone has been strengthening because of the new TV money.

Specifically which lower end team has strengthened significantly? If anything teams are getting ripped apart. Look at Southampton. That doesn't look like strengthening. 

&gt; Tottenham and Newcastle are going to surprise people this year. 
That's just your opinion supported by no evidence. 

Tottenham maybe I can see it happening. Newcastle? How? Their form was dreadful at the end of last year. They were abysmal and have made no improvements. Remy back at QPR now as well. 

&gt; LvG has stated that his sole focus is on the premiere league campaign, that's worrying.

Good for him. I don't think I'll start worrying about Man U managers have to say. Gerrard not being top top player, Hendo, etc. 

&gt; We have a lot of players sub 21 years of age and burnout is a worrying factor with playing 50+ games this year, especially if we are relying on sterling and coutinho for the majority of the campaign. 

Who? Like Sterling? Who else is sub 21 in our starting 11? That's right, no one else. Manquillo 20 years and not certain if he will be our first choice RB. Majority of our quad is 21+

Only valid point is your last one. We are lacking striker depth and I did mention that as a valid concern. 

I don't mean to sound like a personal attack, but most of these points you made are utter nonsense. 

&gt; As of now you can't win an argument against someone saying Chelsea, city and arsenal are locked for top 4 ( yes I realize it's preseason, talking on paper). So who is going to get that 4th spot out of Liverpool, Tottenham and united? I think we can do it but only if we get a decent striker and pull off some butt clenching victories.

Sorry but fuck that attitude. I don't think City, Chelsea or Arsenal will necessarily be taking the top 3 spots. You can't win arguments with rivals fans because you just can't. We have potential to beat any team in the league. We proved that last year. 

&gt; We have gotten weaker you can't replace Suarez and you can't mitigate his contributions to our team in just a year. 

We have gotten weaker in our attacking options with losing Suarez, but we were miles ahead most teams. I think with new additions into the team that gap we had will probably shorten by not by significant amount. 

&gt; My worry is that this summer we needed to make a presence be ballsy and put ourselves in the strongest position we could so we could go for top 4 again, I think the approach we took instead was to be a little too smart for our own good (one of BRs faults) by cleverly starting to build Liverpool 2.0 ,but, be it missing out on signings or naivety, we went ahead with our summer plans forgetting how important that top class striker is to our system. I think we screwed up this summer and are currently, desperately trying to find a short term fix for either January or next summer and hope that our top targets are available this time.

What are you on about? Just because we didn't make a marquee signing? We didn't make any marquee signings last summer and still did pretty well with a thin squad. I think we are in much stronger position this summer than we have been in the last 6 years...

&gt; I think if we don't sign a striker BR will drop us out of the cup games early to shed some games, give a good try in CL but not get passed the group stages and focus on the league, top 4 is the only thing we must accomplish again.

I don't even know how to reply to that. That is utter horseshit. One striker to ruin the whole season for us? Complete nonsense. Only concern is Sturridge picking up an injury. If he stays fit for our important matches we will be more than fine. 2nd highest goal scorer in the prem last season.

2 - I think Filipe Luis has the LB spot locked down for now. We've rotated the 3 of them throughout pre-season, but the consensus of most Chelsea fans is that Azpilicueta and Filipe Luis will start as the main full backs, with Ivanovic rotating.

3 - CB pairing should be JT and Cahill, easily. They were the best CB pairing in the league last year, and I'm sure Mourinho would like to keep it that way.

4 - For now, I think Fabregas will play deeper. Although bear in mind that Oscar may not be entirely fit for our opener against Burnley, so it's possible Fabregas slots into the #10 role for that game. As for goals and assists, I'd hope so, but if he's sitting deep, you could probably get another midfielder that'll be better value.

&gt;  Judah Leb Magnes, head of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a leading figure in bi-nationalism, a utopian strand of Zionism that sought to create a harmonious Jewish-Arab state, went so far as to seek out Eamon de Valera’s thoughts on partition.  Magnes’ original letter does not appear to have survived (it is not included either in de Valera’s papers in UCD nor in Magnes’ papers in the Central Archive for the History of the Jewish People at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem), but de Valera’s extant reply gives an intimate précis of his views on partition, draws an overt comparison between Ireland and Palestine and suggests that Magnes saw things similarly:
&gt; 
&gt; *I do not know the Palestine problem as you know it, but from a knowledge of what partition means in Ireland now, and what I am convinced it will mean in the future, I have reached the same conclusion as you have, namely: only by negotiation and free agreement between Jew and Arab… can there be a satisfactory solution.* **I regard partition as perhaps the worst of the many solutions that have been proposed.**

&gt;Not true. In the league last year we had one different variations of starting 11 in the league. He managed rotating the squad just fine when injuries started to hit.

Dude that's not managing squad rotation that's playing with injuries. When you have 2 to 3 games over a 10 day period and have to manage playing time, like a potential united, champions league game, arsenal fixture all close to each other, that's rotating your squad. Last year we had pretty much our core 11 plus Allen and Sakho with the odd aspas or Moses sighting. Not going to be the case this year.


&gt;Yes because Arsenal had such good squad depth last year. Man Utd have amazing squad depth this year as well right?


Not talking about last year, they have depth this year though. United isn't a champions league team thus I wasn't talking about them.



&gt;Specifically which lower end team has strengthened significantly? If anything teams are getting ripped apart. Look at Southampton. That doesn't look like strengthening. 


Southampton is getting massive money for all their signings and have already signed some decent talent, west ham, crystal palace, Newcastle, stoke city, Everton have made good signings.

&gt;That's just your opinion supported by no evidence. 

So? A well educated one..Seems you have a couple of your opinions thrown in as well.

&gt;Good for him. I don't think I'll start worrying about Man U managers have to say. Gerrard not being top top player, Hendo, etc. 


don't have to worry about what he says but if you don't give even some grudging respect to LvG he'll destroy you.


&gt;Who? Like Sterling? Who else is sub 21 in our starting 11? That's right, no one else. Manquillo 20 years and not certain if he will be our first choice RB. Majority of our quad is 21+

Coutinho is 21, markovic is 20, Flanagan is 21, Emre Can is 20, Moreno just turned 22. Granted it isn't all sub 21 but my point is we have a young squad with a huge flux of games and we can't expect them to stay consistent throughout the campaign here will be slumps.

&gt;Only valid point is your last one. We are lacking striker depth and I did mention that as a valid concern. 

We really are :(


&gt;Sorry but fuck that attitude. I don't think City, Chelsea or Arsenal will necessarily be taking the top 3 spots. You can't win arguments with rivals fans because you just can't. We have potential to beat any team in the league. We proved that last year. 

Sure we can beat those teams but we aren't playing against them 38 times just twice and c'mon do you really think by the end of the year one of those three won't be in the top 4? The last time arsenal was out of the top 4 was when Moses wrote down the commandments, Chelsea and Mourinho will laugh to the trophy, and pellegrini will just sit back and chill while fc Abu Dhabi gets it's derude on. 

Sorry just playing devils advocate for the most part. I think most people are putting on a brave can do face because of last year but there are some real obstacles we are going to have to overcome and I think it'll be a tough, emotionally draining season but have faith we can pull it off.

EDIT- cause I didn't reply to the transfer part. I never said marquee signing I don't believe in marquee signings, but we definitely didn't get ballsy. I think we were really reliant on Sanchez and when he snubbed us we were scrambling for a new plan. We buy lambert for borini replacement but end up keeping borini so now if etoo looks to be it are you happy with replacing Suarez with lambert and etoo, hell no. I think simply our summer didn't go to plan in terms of attacking options and first team direct influence, but we covered our depth and building for the future aka the Liverpool 2.0, but didn't address any of out immediate needs (thank god Lovren) so we will be a step behind the top competition which I think is wasteful and a hurdle we could have avoided.

It is very unlikley that you will get a 1 bed apartment for £400, you need to think smaller. Most properties in the area are terraced houses with locking doors on each of the rooms, shared bathrooms/ensuits and kitchens are the norm. 

If possible look through your Uni facebook to see if anyone is looking to house share - this can ofc bring its own problems but you can potentially get more bang for your buck and a more student experience - you have to consider full bills though (gas electric internet etc).

The Holy lands/lower Ormeau road area is where I am living and where you will find the best prices and the majority of things you will find will be rentals, it is also a very heavily student/foreign national populated area as well as being (passively) catholic area, so it can get a bit rough around St Patricks day.

Sturridge was a no brainer for me. There's a chance he gets injured quite a bit, but being the main man for us this season makes the risk well worth it. 

I have Lovren because I think out of all our CBs, he'll play the most, and probably score a few goals as well. 

Sterling was a bit of a tough choice, but my reasoning was that I think he'll score more than Coutinho and Hendo, and he'll probably have his share of assists.

Instructor was saying ride clutch around slow tight corners. When ever he said this I was already fully off the clutch pretty confused. He said Mod1 practise would really help with clutch control, so maybe relates to this.

I never did any practise t junctions before hitting the road, maybe just need more practise with them. I almost went into the curb on my first t junction (stopped at curb facing the curb at an angle), was on a slight hill, group of people watching, too much input in one go maybe panicked, rest of these were fine following that.

My lane positioning was really good, its the part just after that I was confused about. Example a left turn into a straight road, I ended up in other lane somehow, this was after loads of perfectly good ones. Position was right not sure what happened.

Also I tried to lean sometimes to make up for my lack of steering, instructor said this was because I was not looking where i wanted to go. 

Sorry if this is a bit unclear, was a while ago now.

No one knows who the fullbacks are going to be. I wouldn't select anyone from Chelsea's defence except for Cahill. Even then, I think there is better value out there. I know it's unpopular to go without a Chelsea defender, but defenders score the fewest points in the game, and for £5.0 you can get a defender who will score 10-40 points off of what Cahill will, and the extra £1.5m will help you make up that differential easily if spent wisely on midfield or attacking players.

Terry and Cahill will start at CB. Terry may or may not be rotated with Ivanovic. Again, no one knows. 

Fábregas is going to play in the hole for the first couple games while Oscar regains match fitness. He has played much better from deep in preseason however, but that is where he will be playing for the majority of the season once Oscar is back in the lineup. I expect him to get 10 goals this season +/– 3 and 14 assists +/– 4. I think Hazard and Costa are automatic selections, so it is very risky to put Fábregas in the team as a third Chelsea player, especially when your other options at that price are Mata and Ramsey, both of whom could end up outscoring Fábregas.

For the first couple of games, it will be Hazard, Fábregas, Schürrle, and then Oscar will play in the hole instead of Fábregas. Schürrle probably won't be rotated as heavily as he was last season, but expect Willian to get some serious playing time and Salah to get a few minutes too. If Schürrle starts, and for some reason you've decided against Hazard (which would be a massive mistake), then Schürrle could be one of the most explosive players this season and a great differentiator since his percentage ownership is so low. That being said, I don't think the risk is worth it until Schürrle shows form. ",0,1407868651,null,0,1407868907,0,cjoadfc,t3_2dcrdw,t1_cjoadfc,t3_2dcrdw,null,1435202340,0,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,0

The BBC should be funded directly from the government, funding it through a license is wasteful and wrong and results in this situation.

It isn't a massively long term solution as it does pollute but we have to contend with a few factors; We have a number of nuclear power plants soon to close and the next generation will not be ready to meet energy demands any time soon, whilst renewable energy is good and is the future it will take time to build those industries to the point that they can accommodate our needs, the geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe and the North Sea Oil won't last forever. There is a lot of misinformation and scaremongering when it comes to fracking so it's worth looking at what scientific bodies have had to say since 2011 (when a number of review were commissioned).

After some intense digging, and a subsequent phone call to them to clarify, I discovered that you only need a license if you're watching live streaming. It turns out, however, that TV licensing have, over the years, altered their language so while once this was clear, now it is often worded in such a way so as to convince you that you need a license by virtue of simply owning a TV or Laptop, because they're capable.

From here: http://tv-licensing.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/tv-licence-summons-what-to-do.html?m=1

&gt;Edit (17/8/13): We should probably mention the unusual situation where a defendant does not receive their summons, so is completely unaware they are facing prosecution and are convicted without their knowledge. In these circumstances the defendant should make a Statutory Declaration (see form on Resources page), which is effectively a sworn statement denying all knowledge of the case. The completed Declaration should then be submitted to the court, which should then overturn the conviction. If there is sufficient time, TV Licensing may re-issue the summons for a second attempt at prosecution.

Link to the form: https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B0eNVR3Ar16ZN2ZPb2lDWTRibWs

&gt;Statutory Declaration Form: Complete this form if you were unaware that TV Licensing were taking legal proceedings and the court has consequently convicted you in your absence. This is not all that uncommon. You will need to read the completed Declaration to a qualified person (usually a Magistrate or solicitor) who will act as a witness. The completed form should then be submitted to the court, who should overturn your conviction. TV Licensing may re-issue a summons for the same offence if your conviction is overturned in this way

Other things I didn't have right: I'm not entirely sure why Taylor is in goal ahead of Silvestri. Sure, he needs games too, but Silvestri is our number one and will only benefit from more games considering his relative inexperience. Tonge is in ahead of Murphy, which is fine. He's looking better than Murphy right now and I think that both the midfield and forward line could start against Middlesbrough if they do well enough.

I like the look of Smith up front with Doukara and Ajose either side of him, having two players capable of latching onto Smith's flick-ons, dribbling with the ball and hopefully giving Smith the service he needs sounds really good.

Homophobia and misogyny are rampant all over the third world. Does that make them suddenly not the underdogs in geopolitics? Does that mean we should just say ""nah fuck 'em"" and wait until they learn to overcome things that took us long enough to do with a much easier time of it?

Education is the key to solving social problems like misogyny and homophobia but how can you tackle that when your schools are rubble?

&gt;But that's exactly what Sinn Fein does with the IRA and PIRA...

You're missing the point. You don't look at a conflict and take sides because one side 70 years ago used similar tactics to your own country 20 years again before that. You look at the actual situation on the ground right now and base your opinions on that. Israel today is a very different animal to what it was at its inception.

&gt; I mean, loyalists go on about being ""under siege"" and so do the Palestinians...

The Palestinians in Gaza are literally under siege. The UN has even referred to it as a siege.

I used to think exactly the same way. I though suicide was an easy way out, you're not around to face the consequences, you don't have to mop up the remnants, but I genuinely believe it's not like that at all.  
People who commit suicide think they are at the end, there is no way forward, they've thought about it a lot usually, and the net balance of all the pros and cons is that they'd be better off gone, and I find that desperately sad. The flippancy of people on here is getting me down.

In exchange for that, other people may have been negatively affected, people she either wasn't considering or thought her needs were greater than (rightly or wrongly).

I think you could also argue that the manner of her suicide could be described as selfish (treading lightly, signs say tasteless territory), but that would depend on if you believed her own ability to analyse as much at the time absolves the act of selfishness or not.

true,NervousEnergy,eng-yorkshire,Welshman in Yorkshire,"Pay them more; on par or more with their private sector and Local Government counterparts.

The Directors of companies, the Chief Executives of local councils, the top Private Secretaries all earn in excess of £100,000 a year easily. Yet MP's are far more highly scrutinised and often have harder jobs than these roles.

Really, it's the bizarre public obsession with keeping the MP's salaries as low as possible that caused the expenses scandal. They were topping up their, comparatively low salaries, with expenses. Granted, some of the claims were utter bullcrap, but I'd be much more in favour of increasing the salary ten fold and scrapping expenses altogether.

Another issue with low pay is that private companies offer a far more advantageous employment than being an MP does. You've got to be a special kind of person to accept a lower pay than you would in other sectors, and accept constant lambastation in the media for every single tiny thing you do. Conversely, the low pay might also mean that only those with funds behind them, the rich upper class, are attracted to this job. That isn't great for the health of the government when the majority of Members all come from the same background (obviously low pay isn't the sole cause of this problem but I don't think it helps).

So yeah. Pay them more. Get rid of their expenses. Also it would be good to forbid them from being able to hold other jobs while being an MP: as, IMO, it should be a full time job. ",0,1407871191,null,0,false,0,cjobthk,t3_2dcljj,t1_cjobthk,t3_2dcljj,null,1435203213,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

It really does mean not seeing your family most of the time since even on 120k it's not straight forward to maintain two homes, one fairly close into London.   But maybe that's fine?   Maybe public representatives should be people either a) with no family b) family they aren't a part of or c) rich enough to cart their whole family down to a family sized flat and independent school places as required.   As a parent it wouldn't necessarily be the accommodation that would spring to mind first  (you can probably rent something ok for wife and several kids even after paying another mortgage elsewhere).  The thing that would occur to me first is the difficulty of maintaining kids education while moving them around to be near dad.   We give priority places / independent school places to armed service personnel and diplomats who have to move frequently for their job (since state schools won't keep places open if you leave).   Dunno if we do the same for MPs though I suspect they're expected to foot temporary private school bills themselves.   Honestly can't think of another public job that requires two homes and private school fees if you want to see your kids consistently.",0,1407871519,null,0,false,0,cjoc02v,t3_2daaxo,t1_cjoc02v,t1_cjo9xyv,null,1435203301,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I refuse to buy a license as I don't legally need one. They tell me all sorts of crap when I answer the door to them, including ""we've heard the TV on"" and ""we've started the court summons process"".
It's amazing how quickly they leave once they know they are being recorded. Most of the time they just walk away without ever even talking to me.

true,retroshark,cnty-england,England,"im learning as we speak. after a divorce and about 2.5 years of being mostly totally alone, i started reaching out. Im very introverted and have a hard time talking about things im passionate about, out of fear of being judged. normally if you can get me to talk about my passions, ill instantly consider you half way to frindship. maybe not that extreme, but when someone asks me about my hobbies or my business in genuine interest, there is nothing more fun than showing and telling them all about it. ive found that people really love to talk about... what they love... who woulda thought!? so now i try to engage people in a way that I would want to be engaged. Sometimes maybe I get a bit over the top and enthusiastic about stuff but i think ive found a balance of my natural cynicism and my ability to get excited for and about other people and their interests. 

I think the key thing is isolating an area of intense interest between the both of you, and to basically throw everything you can into expanding eachothers knowledge about it, or just engaging in it. also, I find that when Im struggling to ""define"" a friendship with someone, I try to take the lead by showing them things I like to do or how I like to do them. When I have people over, I always tell them make yourself at home, take your shoes off (or not!) if you want, and i encourage them to look at my things, pick stuff up and ask questions. Ive found that inviting people over to my place works far better than meeting up. It gives me plenty to talk about and lots of easy material for conversation between the both of us. It also keeps me in my comfort zone because I feel in control of whats happening.

true,kelvinkks,null,null,"Hello! I thought I'd drop a line since I live in London and can give you a breakdown of my costs. I live fairly central in E2* (read addendum below on London postcodes) and I thought I'd give you an idea of some of my basic costs:

**BASICS**

- **Rent:** £728/month for a room in 3 bedroom house with a backyard (whole house is £2450/month)

- **Transport (Oyster card):** £100/month, I have it running on auto-topup, you might get better value if you buy a monthly pass or something depending if you use the Oyster to get to work, I walk to work.

- **Mobile phone:** £12/month (prepaid, unlimited 3g internet on giffgaff network)

- **Electricity &amp; Gas:** £106/month on a fixed rate plan for the whole house (Extra Energy), it's a fair sized place. I divide it among 3 people (£35/month).

- **Water:** £35/month (paid every six months for the whole house, so about £210/6 months).

- **Internet:** £42/month (£26/month for the unlimited internet subscription, £16/month line rental, both with BT)

**TOTAL BASIC: £920.50**




**MISC**

- **Takeaway dinner for 2 (or 1 in my case, I eat a lot):** £20

- **Loaf of bread (Tesco):** 90 pence

- **Takeaway coffee at a gourmet cafe (small flat white):** £2.50

- **1 litre bottle of olive oil:** £3

- **Dinner out for one (varies, depending on where you go):** £15 – £150

- **Theatre tickets:** £25-£120 (I usually buy the £70-80 seats for a good view)

- **Movie tickets:** £12/pp

- **Crossfit membership:** £145 for 20 sessions a month (I had to ask a friend about this, I don't do crossfit – seriously though, 20 sessions is literally every weekday)


I can give you more examples if you want them. Anything specific?


Just a note on the grocery stores here, they actually get more expensive in this order: Iceland, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose and the quality of produce goes up accordingly. Most people just shop at Tesco or Sainsbury's. I wouldn't shop at Iceland, quality isn't great at all (but super super cheap). There's a cheaper alternative to IKEA flatpack furniture here (it is possible!) which is Argos, I find their stuff pretty okay – most flats come fully furnished here though. 

As a note on taxis, black cabs are expensive, but they're the only type of cab you can hail down. A much cheaper alternative (up to 25-40% cheaper) is to use either the Kabbee or Uber smartphone apps to summon a taxi. And oh, to navigate public transport in London, Citymapper is the best app for accuracy.

Hope this helps (my lifestyle is by no means considered frugal btw – my friends think I'm fairly spendthrift).

You can look at take home salaries here (these are rough): http://www.netsalarycalculator.co.uk/

Assuming that your husband is on £46000 a year, you can expect £2,818 as his take home, minus basics for just himself, he'll have about £1,898 a month to left over for groceries and entertainment. Assuming no saving, that's £60/day – which is quite a bit! Assuming you want to save, let's say 21% (£400/month), that still leaves you about £50/day, which is enough to eat out every single day of the week with change. :P

*London postcodes radiate out from the center of London (the City – *C, i.e. WC2, EC2) to the suburbs (W1, W2, W3, W5 or E1, E2, E3 – you get the idea, just a rule of thumb, there are exceptions) so you can tell how central a person is from the first part of their postcode, and the general rule of thumb is the more central you are, the more expensive things get!)

&gt; As an important market town, St Ives always needed large numbers of pubs, 64 in 1838 (1 for every 55 inhabitants), 60 in 1861, 48 in 1865 and 45 in 1899 (though only 5 of these made the owners living). However, as livestock sales diminished, so did the need for large numbers of pubs, falling to a low point of 16 in 1962. 

&gt; In that year the ""Seven Wives"" on Ramsey Road was opened and, with some openings and closings since, there are 17 today.

St Ives didn't turn into a ghost town after all those pubs closed, it's quite lively, but something *changed* such that it could no longer support that many pubs. The change in St Ives was obvious, but the social changes which are occurring all over the UK are probably part of what is causing these pubs to close as well.

true,retroshark,cnty-england,England,"Ive thought about lots of ways to do it. You could build stuff to use as pieces for wargaming or other strategy gaming. You could have a weekly or monthly themes or competitions.... speed-building, large-scale projects or even working towards a big piece with the mind to display it somewhere in public... who knows.

I find that its incredibly meditative, and for a lot of people it really helps to break down social boundaries. Ive had even the most harsh and cynical of folk step into my place, see the lego and instantly be transported back to childhood. Also, I notice in a lot of social interactions there is this sense that both parties would rather be doing something else, possibly instead of or at the same time as socialising, but dont do so out of fear of offending the other person. Even if its just checking messages on your phone or browsing a few reddits, i always get a sense people are uncomfortable acting distracted in front of people. 

personally i love it when my friends operate in their own way when we hang out. they can be watching something on their phone, holding a conversation with me while i build or sort lego... I found that if other people are shown that its ok to do other random tasks whilst still socialising with another person then it can be a much more positive social experience. no need to both do the same task or work on something together... its like study groups. sometimes its really nice to have people around you who you might not be talking with but are all happily doing their own things, just in the company of one another. in my mind there is a big difference between having company of another person, socialising with another person or actively engaging with another person.

Biking is very much about experience. More so I believe than other forms of transport seem to be. I don't mean bad experience, I mostly mean experimentation. There's no way you're gonna just jump on a bike and corner perfectly and know what's happening with your machine because ""one-ness"" isn't a conscious thing.

Feeling at one with your machine is achieved by first consciously figuring out what happens as a result of something you do, like leaning in a certain way in corners, then when you've realised it and done it enough it becomes subconscious, that's when you start to notice finer points that you didn't before. Eventually it breaks down into fine details  and the more you're on a machine the more you get to know it. The more riding you do, the faster you notice it on a new bike. 

I guess in your case, the DAS would help you get the experience you need, but I did my progression to full license on the old system after a year on my 125. Looking back, I was pretty sloppy compared to now, and I still have a lot of room for improvement, but it comes with time.

**Coutinho, Sterling** and **Henderson** are the three players I think other fans should look out for. 

Sterling has already shown what he can do and last season got quite a few goals and assists, I expect him to step it up another level this season and hopefully get into double figures for goals. 

I think Coutinho will be our main playmaker and if Sterling and Sturridge can get on the end of his ridiculously good passes then I'm sure he'll have a lot of assists come May, I'm also hoping he'll chip in with a few more goals this year too! Seriously though if people pay close attention to Coutinho they'll see what a talent he is, hopefully he'll take over the nutmeg three players a game duty from Suarez!

Henderson was our engine last season and many say we lost the league the day he was suspended and I have to agree. He must be a nightmare for opposition players because he just doesn't stop running, ever. I could imagine him to be at home running on the spot right now.

Based on the beer cans opening periodically and the creaking of the door opening and shutting, I always imagined it as some kind of dimly lit, plywood paneled closet with four or five odd-looking men huddled over an old bar table. There's a single bare light bulb hanging from a wire above them, keeping you faces and the rest of the room around in perpetual shadow. I imagined Spurs graffiti carved into the top of the table, and ""Flav is a cunt"" written in silver Sharpie in the middle. You sit on rickety old bar stools, missing some of the lower cross-pieces so that you can't rest your feet on them. As a result, you always dangle one foot above the floor, itself sticky from spilled beer. The cracked, curling, and peeling lino down there hasn't seen a mop since the Tony Blair years. You fellas don't sound like you smoke on the air--I never hear lighters--but I nonetheless imagine a haze of smoke from rolled cigarettes. Certainly there is a half-full ashtray on the table, amid empty beer cans, empty packets of crisps (the *real* national food of England), those little plastic sleeves that filter come in, and perhaps the odd half-cup of ancient tea.

I know a lot of fans have written us off the top 3 finish. But I think we will surprise everyone once more. The biggest thing about Liverpool is our squad's cohesiveness. I truly believe it makes a big difference. I trust Brendao's management skills and the ability to bring the right kind of players into the team. I predict a top 3 finish.


2. Three players to watch out for - Coutinho, Sterling, Can. 

**Coutinho** has easily been our best man pre-season. Those flicks, turns and through balls. He's going to be crucial to the way we play. I hope he's going to combine well with the likes of Lallana, Markovic, Sterling and Sturridge. And he's working on his finishing too.

**Sterling** is going to have a stellar season, IMO. I think right now he's sort of donning Suarez's role in Liverpool. Great pace, dribbling and most importantly, the man is made of steel. Most people who don't follow liverpool do not realize how strong Sterling is. He's going to be a nightmare for most of the defenses.

**Can** just signed for us this summer but I'm really surprised how well he has gelled into the squad. It's almost as if he has been playing for Liverpool for ages. Great pace and really strong. Am pretty sure he's going to be handy in outmuscling opponents in the midfield and in our defense.

I'd recommend proper kit, but it's your skin to do with as you like. I was told the following:

&gt; When sliding along the ground constantly (say, on your arse after coming off):

&gt; * Jeans will last 1 second before you hit the skin;

&gt; * Textile will last 3 seconds before you hit the skin; and

&gt; * Leather will last 5 seconds before you hit the skin.




I'm not sure how true it is but it sounds plausible. In order to be sliding constantly for 5 seconds you need to be going at a decent speed but none of that will help alleviate impact damage.

Just think about it, do some research, look at what people say here from their experience and advice, then if needs be watch a few crashes on youtube (Roadcraft Nottingham has a video of a relatively slow speed one, so you can get an idea of what they're like).

Some players to look out for. I think coutinho is going to be a big player for us this season as rodgers described him as ""the brain of the team"". His spectacular passing is such an asset in a fast paced team like Liverpool and he seems to have improved over the summer.

I also think lovern will be a huge signing for us. He seems strong and composed at the back which should allow us to play a strong high line. His leadership along with our other signings in defense should strengthen our back five, which was the biggest weakness last season.",0,1407874037,null,0,false,0,cjodfe8,t3_2dd5jb,t1_cjodfe8,t3_2dd5jb,null,1435203779,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

true,Rayalas,lfc99,,"1. Top 4 - We lost Suarez, but we've improved drastically in other areas. Namely, defense. We lacked a leader and brought in Lovren to fix that. We lacked good FBs, and brought in Moreno and Manquillo. Mignolet is improving, and with Lovren being a leader, I expect our defense will have less errors this season. Not to mention, they're more capable of recovering when needed compared to last year (I'm looking at you, Johnson!). Our attack is still strong. Sturridge is a fantastic striker and he'll prove that this year. Sterling is improving rapidly, and now we've further improved our options with Lallana and Markovic. We really need one more striker, but otherwise I'm really liking the look of our team right now, can't wait for the start of the season!

2. Kind of obvious choices, but here they are anyways:

    **Sterling** - He's only getting better. Towards the end of last season he was our best player, and during preseason he was continuing that form. Everyone knows he's quick, but in a lot of ways he's pretty similar to Suarez. Great ball control, determined, strong, and draws lots of fouls / penalties. His finishing is getting better, and he made some pretty damn good long shots this preseason. A lot of teams are going to struggle against him.

    **Henderson** - He's everywhere regardless of what position he starts in, LW, RB, DM, etc... you name it, he'll be there. He just needs to get involved in plays more through smart runs / quick one twos, which he seems to be getting better at. I expect he'll get more goals this season and still pressing players all over the pitch.

    **Coutinho** - The kid is capable of making Messi like runs and can make some incredible passes. Now with two good attacking full backs, and a front three with incredible pace, he's got an even better set up than last season. Still needs to work on his long shots, but he's getting a little bit closer with every one... 

3.  http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=41ry8
 
    Sakho could very well come in at some point, but I expect Skrtel will be starting, and won't make it easy for Sakho to take his spot.

4. Most importantly, we're still going to be the most entertaining team to watch.",0,1407874337,null,0,1407876305,0,cjodlhi,t3_2dd5jb,t1_cjodlhi,t3_2dd5jb,null,1435203858,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

 Now on the face of it, with Suarez gone, and only mid-tier signings, that might seem horribly optimistic. Yet most people seemed to judge LFC last year on their highlight reels from MOTD (which mostly just showed Suarez finishing). They didn't see the long-build plays that often led to the creative chaos that was created for Suarez to shine. As long as we have that offensive-Chaos, and some shiny new defensive signings that perform well. We will be head-and-shoulders above the cluster-F that is 2nd tier of Manchester United, Tottenham, and Everton. I think that will suprise a lot of people. 

2. The newly arrived 'Spanish Armada' of Javier Manquillo and Alberto Moreno will really make a big difference. Not sure if they will both settle into the starting 11 right away, but will huge difference in how Liverpool defends and builds from the back. Biggest X-factor player, and Lazar Markovic. He's fast and technical, almost a like-for-like with Raheem Sterling, and with Coutinho, as attacking 3 it could get scary for other teams in the near future.

3. http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=41rx3   - I think Skrtel will start the season in the back, but Sahko is too good not to put into the 'best 11' for me.

true,gkedpage,lfc99,,"I think the season will go pretty well. Even though we lost our best player from last season, I think we have strengthened the squad and we still have the second highest goal scorer in the EPL. We should also see significant more goal contribution from the other forwards and midfielders including Sterling, Coutinho, Henderson, Lallana and Markovic. I think we will still get the 4th spot.

The players to watch for will be: **Henderson**, **Coutinho** and **Sterling**. I think everyone has already seen what Raheem ""The Dream"" Sterling can do and now without Suarez overshadowing everyone else, I think Sterling will blossom to be one of the best wingers in the league and will have goals in double digit. Coutinho, what can I say about Coutinho that hasn't already been said. He is a magician, who will be the creative spark for our team. I am confident he will have assists in double digits and atleast 7-10 goals. And finally Hendo, the guy with the georgous hair. He is the engine which keeps our team running. He is essential in the way we play and in my opinion if Henderson hadn't been suspended for the final three games last season, we would have won the league. He will not contribute significantly to the number of goals or assists (maybe 5-7 goals and few assists) but he will help with our pressing game.

true,Adakias,lfc99,,"**1** People are saying Liverpool won't do well this season because we lost Suarez, that we are a one-man team, and we have to find a way to make up for the 31 goals. That's not necessarily true though. Sure, trashing of Arsenal, Tottenham, Everton, Scum, etc. were fun, but scoring that many goals are not necessary to win games. Instead, we've been focusing the off-season on building up our defence. We lost some offensive firepower, but we did make up for it by signing good defenders and a defensive midfielder. In terms of points, there's very little difference between winning 2-0 and 5-0. We've increased depth in almost every position to accommodate for cups and CL. And most importantly, BR is becoming more experienced, and he also has more and more players that he wants. We didn't sweep teams aside last season because of Suarez alone, no. It was because BR played to our strengths and exposed their weaknesses. One example is when we played Arsenal, they played a high line against us. Instead of playing possession football like we normally might, we sat deeper then used our speed to counter, and this was something Arsene had no response for. BR is also very adaptable in game, and now with a deeper squad, we could have a larger number of impact subs (which was something we severely lacked last season). It's difficult for people to predict accurately, but a safe bet is that we get top 4 again, don't make it pass group stage in CL. On paper last season, many people predicted we wouldn't do well. Chelsea was definitely better than us on paper, but we still finished above them. We finished just below Man City, and they didn't really upgrade this season. 

**2** **Sterling**, **Henderson**, **Coutinho**, in that order. 

**Sterling** is improving a lot in a short amount of time. He went from a kid who was only pacey, to one who is extremely calm when playing against defenders, and he's surprisingly strong too. His ability to beat his man 1v1 is extremely important when passing is stagnant and there's no room to manoeuvre. He'll improve as the season goes on, and CL experience will make him even better. 

**Henderson** is a fan-favourite, and essential to BR's system. He never stops running, and presses very quickly to force mistakes. He always tracks back to defend, and runs forward when we attack. This makes it seem like he's everywhere at once, and all his running can even make it seem like we have an extra player on the field. He's one of those players who aren't flashy, but always does the right thing. BR mentioned that he wants Henderson to score more this season, something that he is capable of. Often, you'll see him sprint into the box to get space, and with the right pass he'll calmly slot in goals. 

**Coutinho** is a magician. When you watch football from a bird's eye POV, it's easy to say ""pass to this player"" or ""pass to that player"", because you have the vision to see everything from your POV. On the field, it's not as easy, so players might not necessarily make the right passes. Coutinho does something magical, in which he has such a good vision he'll make unexpected passes that are better than passes one would expect. He's able to thread a needle through a string, find a gap that is seemingly impossible to get through, but somehow place the ball through perfectly.

true,Naggers123,eng-middlesex,Lahn-Dahn Tahn,"&gt;  How would you account for regional variations in costs and how would constituency offices and so on be paid for?

Centralised funding, distributed by an independent body. Regional variations will be taken into account by implementing a scaling system of pay, based on the average cost of living for the area. 

E.G.

£200,000 per annum for offices + 2 researchers.

x

The cost of living in London compared to the average (say, 1.4)

So, £200k * 1.4 = Amount an MP has to spend on constituency affairs. 



&gt; What about an MP representing a geographically very large constituency very far from London vs. a very small constituency closer to parliament?

Travel expenses should be retained. They're relatively easy to account for (which is important given the current hostility regarding expenses fiddling).

In terms of funding for a second home - I'd say anything outside a 1 hour commute to Parliament warrants an apartment in London, which could be chosen by the MP, but approved and paid for by the state. MPs will not be able to pocket the difference if they were to change homes in the future. This would deter MPs simply 'flipping' homes or exploiting rising property values. Furnishings and everything else should be paid out of pocket with the increased salary.

There's also a Boots that will have similar low end brands like superdrug, as well as mid-high end counters. Their Boots brand No7 are worth checking out. Also on Oxford street is Selfridges that stocks NARS, stila, Mac, and loads more.

As far as clothes shops go- Topshop do their own make-up but it can be really hit and miss. According to their website there's a Nyx concession at the oxford street branch of Next.

We now have a greatly improved squad, with players like Lovren, Can, Lallana, Markovic and Lambert giving us something we didn't have last season. We will now be bringing a bench full of game-changing players, rather than names to fill space on the team sheet.

Finishing positions: Nailed on **top-4** in the PL, **R16** in the Cl, **QF** in one of the cups, early drop-out in the other..

**Coutinho** is going to have his breakout season. He's our ""Suárez replacement"", and might well play on the left as Suárez did for us last season. All our attacking play seemed to go through him during the preseason. **Henderson** and **Can** are going to be other important midfielders for us this year, who also looked good throughout our warm-up matches.

Any previous membership cannot be touched. It was accumulated under a set of terms and conditions that it is illegal to go back on. The government can refuse to offer those terms any more, but they would be utterly suicidal to try and pull some sort of givzies backsies game (plus as I said illegal).

The way that it works is that your wife will essentially have 2 pensions. One in the 1995 section, preserved until she chooses to claim it, and another in the 2015 section. They will not impact each other.

In short, I know of no plans, or even legal grounds, by which the government could change a preserved pension. Just make sure she gets a forecast and a membership history before opting out in order to ensure that all the information is correct. NHS Pension records are, in general, a complete mess. Making sure her service is correct would be wise, and get her to bug her pension department to provide the NHS Pensions Agency with her 'preservation figure' (I.E salary at leaving) this is something that's seen as a low priority job and often doesn't get done for a while.

Can I ask why she's opting out? In April the 2015 will be the only scheme in town and even being a CARE scheme it's likely going to be a better deal than any private pension she'd find.

Hoping for a solid top 4 standing at the end of the season and maybe a cup win.

**2.** Obviously since Suarez's departure, **Sturridge** will become the main man in terms of goals. Had 21 goals last season bettered only by Luis himself, hoping for the same, if not better, form again. **Sterling** will hopefully continue his incredible development on the back of being the only impressive England player at the WC and chip in with more goals. Unsung hero **Henderson**'s contribution may not be noticed by those who only look at goals and assists but he is the engine to this Liverpool team. You saw how they performed without him at the back end of the season after his red card vs City so he will be vital to Liverpool's performance.

Costa once again looked incredibly dangerous, was clinical and looks like he's already developed some solid chemistry with our other attacking players.

Hazard looks like he's ready to go, and is getting into better positions now that defenders have to worry about Costa as well.

Fabregas once again controlled the game from deep, and Matic once again didn't get a thing wrong.

Ramires looks like he's getting his touch back and looks much more promising than he did for most of last season.

Willian and Oscar don't seem to have improved from their form last season. I don't think either one deserves a starting spot at the moment, I'd put our attacking 3 as Schurrle-Hazard-Salah at the moment. Hopefully that changes as the season progresses.

It might be worth phoning the police also, pointing out the urgency of the issue (if the weather in your area is hot then I can't imagine it's cool enough in a brick shed) and that the animal is constantly howling in distress which is also a noise complaint issue. 

Hopefully the police will investigate the circumstances and refer the RSPCA as a priority. 

The only other option I can think of is personal action which would involve trespassing on your part. However if you truly fear for the animals well-being then perhaps that's a small price.

I especially like /u/skooo comment:
&gt;Boots Oxford St (the one near HMV) is best for drugstore brands, along with the Superdrug down by Selfridges. Superdrug is good for MUA and Makeup Revolution (if it's made it instore by the time you get here). Both shops sell the usual range of Loreal, Maybelline, Revlon, Rimmel, Barry M, Models Own, Sleek etc. Boots also have 17 and No 7.

&gt;The massive Topshop at Oxford Circus is a bit like the seventh circle of hell, but on the ground floor they have a massive selection of Topshop brand makeup (it's good stuff). They also have a Beauty Mart concession but that stuff is all horribly overpriced.

&gt;Try John Lewis for Lipstick Queen, mid range brands like Bobbi Brown, Laura Mercier, Benefit and Japonesque. Debenhams and House of Fraser stock the usual mid range brands, that's where you need to go for Urban Decay.
Next on oxford st stocks NYX though it's a reduced range, the stand is usually half empty and a mess, and it's quite expensive.

&gt;Then hit Selfridges (on Oxford st down towards marble arch) for Illamasqua, Mac, Charlotte Tilbury, Shu Uemura (sp??), NARS and other mid to high end brands. As well as the beauty room there's the Beauty Workshop which sells stuff like OCC, and some lovely skincare brands.

&gt;If you are after the pricier stuff like By Terry, Diptique and Chantecaille, try Space NK on South Molton St near Boots.

&gt;For Inglot you'll have to head out to Westfield Shepherds Bush.

Unfortunately, we don't have a sephora nor do I know of anywhere that sells Wet'n'Wild (believe me, I wish we did)

true,alk3v,lfc99,,"1. I predict 4th, progression from their CL group and 1 deep cup run. It will be a show of the team's depth this year. People made a big deal out of Liverpool's title run being due to fewer fixtures. Top four is a must, as is raising the club's coefficient this year in the Champions League. Progressing out of their CL group and a 4th place finish would be seen as a decent year. People are expecting a collapse post Suarez and I'm thinking they don't see the full picture. Last season was overachieving but what really happened was a squad cohesion and chemistry that outshined even the season Suarez put in. Suarez had a part in 40 goals (assists included), Liverpool still scored 60 more. Gerrard reinvented himself as a deep lying playmaker. Sterling had a stellar year adding goals to his game. Sturridge had a 20 goal season. Henderson established himself as a guaranteed starter. Everyone on the team developed and even the subs/backups looked lively. Additionally, there is no single player on the planet other than Ronaldo or Messi that can replace Suarez. You do not replace a world class player like for like, you improve the squad where it is weakest. Clearly the defense after last season. Now improved with new full backs, Lovren and added pressure on current defenders. 

2. Coutinho, Sterling and Can. Coutinho and Sterling are going to have pivotal years as far their careers are concerned. They are approaching the ages where their potential as world class players needs to shine if they are to attain that level. I predict one or both will make a run for YPFA. Coutinho in particular looks like he has a point to prove after his Brazil WC omission. I'm pointing out Can because if he flops this year, Gerrard and Lucas are both a year older and the CDM position looks weak for years to come. Early signs are good, and he appears to be the muscle in midfield that Liverpool's been looking for since Mascherano left.

3. Best eleven is one thing, but more importantly the depth chart. After Suarez's sale, there's a huge gap in the striker position. Perhaps a signing will come. Perhaps not. However, the depth of the team have improved immensely, note that the starting eleven midfield and forward isn't that changed from last year without Suarez. http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=4226",0,1407876797,null,0,1407901334,0,cjof04i,t3_2dd5jb,t1_cjof04i,t3_2dd5jb,null,1435204522,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

A couple of years back he bought out an autobiography (very good btw) and two one hour specials on Sky; One called ""Welcome to the Places of my Life"" and one called ""Open Books"".

true,DRBB22,null,null,"For us, I think the key to winning the title is being able to break down defensive minded teams. Now Costa may not entirely be the answer, but he's certainly a big, big help. At Atletico, his physical nature and general goalscoring ability meant he was able to demand the attention of opposing defenders, and he proved adept at creating space for his trickier teammates like Koke. We effectively didn't have this last year; defenders didn't grant as much attention to Torres nor Eto'o and that equated to more bodies to close out the likes of Hazard.

Furthermore, we also looked a little starved of creativity in the final 3rd, especially when the opposition had bodies behind the ball. Fabregas helps here, seeing as he's excellent at finding the little gaps of space in even the most packed back lines.

Finally, don't discount the importance of Filipe Luis. Azpilicueta was excellent defensively last year, but the fact that he wasn't left-footed meant he couldn't supply any real, meaningful width down the left-hand side. This often resulted in Hazard being marked by the right back, and the wide midfielder immediately ahead of him; again, it became another issue that stifled us.

true,severedfragile,lfc68,,"1. Could honestly finish anywhere from 1st to 6th, but optimism is definitely prevailing now. A good striker to come in and I think a top 4 place won't seem unlikely. I'd say 3rd (behind the obvious 2) but it'll be close between us, Arsenal and United. It's going to come down to the mid-table sides I think, we'll really see how much we miss Suarez when we're up against teams he'd normally blow away on his own. For all our strengths, we still don't necessarily have the guile or experience to look to to break up really sturdy defences - though Sterling and Coutinho are definitely capable of doing it at times, and the likes of Can and Markovic add speed and strength that'll help. We have explosive players who are capable of destroying defences, but not yet an established Silva/Mata/Ozil/Cesc-style player who'll pick those teams apart when everything else doesn't work.

2. **Coutinho** for a lot of the reasons listed - he's the guy we have who can do that, and if he can start doing it consistently, there's hardly a blemish to spot in  our attack. He was vital to our improvements last season - when he was injured in the first half of the season, we lacked a player who could retain possession in the final 3rd, and although the style and system have arguably evolved since then (partially due to that) he's still the best in the team at it. He's a lot stronger than he looks and his ability to win the ball and carry it in midfield is another major asset. He gets the headlines for his through-balls but his all-round game is developing to the point where there's no situation that's beyond him. Also, his through balls to Sturridge/Sterling/Markovic are going to be lethal. 

**Sterling** because he's fucking incredible. It's laughable how many people have got him down as a pace-merchant and nothing else when you see his technical ability, intelligence and vision. Now it's down to whether he can maintain the form of the second half of last year over a full season. He and Coutinho were Liverpool's most impressive players over pre-season, so the signs are good. I'd expect to see him everywhere from wide to #10 to second striker at times; the fact that he can do all 3 in the space of 10 minutes is what makes him such a remarkable talent. 

**Lovren** because he's basically tasked with leading our defence. Rodgers isn't really a manager who favours a particular defensive system, preferring to let players take charge of situations and the unit. That's great when the defenders are on the same page, but they patently were not a lot of last season. Sakho could be brilliant if he was a more dominant presence and leader, Skrtel still plays like a defender who'd prefer the attack to come to him rather than one who snuffs it out in its infancy and Agger... Agger is hard to really analyse because he's often great, seems to make his teammates play better and always seems to have an understanding with them, but at the same time doesn't always seem in charge of situations and gets outmuscled more than our other CBs. The main thing they have in common is that they all look like they could use a Carragher/Hyypia-esque force beside them keeping everything in order, and Lovren's clearly the guy Brendan thinks can do that. Whatever CB combination we use, it's safe to assume he's going to be the constant. I don't know if he was anyone's first choice (out of the fanbase) but if he's what Rodgers wants, that's what he's got. He's the de facto leader of our defence and it's a defence that's got everything *but* a leader. 

And for the hell of it, a few others:

Gerrard - how much will he play? How much SHOULD he play? Every time he has a bad game, he seems to follow it up with a brilliant game, like he just wants to keep twitter shouting.

Hendo - How many fucks will he give? 2? 3? Zero? Will he go into negatives? He's shown the Gerrard-(lite)-like ability to add whatever the team is missing at any given time, be it goals, penetration, creativity, physicality, running like a cunt, etc. It's the kind of thing that makes him look like a future captain, and with Gerrard likely to play less this season, it's the kind of thing that makes him a player who needs to take responsibility. Also would be nice if he could learn to finish better.

Sturridge - It feels like he should be on more of these lists, but it's actually completely logical that he isn't - there's no real story around him, no questions. If he stays fit, he'll score. It's that simple. 

Lallana - Big signing, overpriced, manager's pick, left his old club (whom he captained) with some bad blood, already injured, doubts about how good he can really consistently be, plays in two positions where Liverpool are already pretty strong. Everything's set up for him to flop, so he's probably in the biggest, most temperamental spotlight.

true,[deleted],null,null,"**1. How do you think this season will go?**

I actually think it'll go one of two ways. Either we'll carry on the way we did last season with maybe a few less goals and more solidity at the back, while dealing with the rigours of European football using the new found depth we've got in the squad. Anywhere between 1st-4th would be possible, but I think we'd definitely be in the title equation if we carried on playing how we played last year. In my opinion, the alternative is that we don't quite deal with European pressures, our signings don't gel and we get put under a lot of pressure and wilt. Then I don't think we'll get CL and 5th-7th might be the result.

Personally, I think with the way the Premier League is set up to go this year we won't be solely battling for 4th place, I think if we're in the top 4 we'll have to also be in the title equation which will require us to carry on our form from last year. At the same time, looking at our performances in preseason (particularly the demolition of Dortmund at Anfield), we look fit and ready for the new season and I think a surprise title challenge could well be on the cards.

TL;DR Title challenge or bust.

**2. Which 3 players should other fans watch out for and why? It would help if you can put the 3 names in bold.**

***Phillipe Coutinho***

The man is an absolute magician with the ball. If he can find consistency, he can be one of the top midfielders in the world; some of his passes are absolutely out of this world. Has a poor shooting record and he has a tendency to drift out of games, but with more experience and a bit of shooting practice he could certainly assert himself as one of the top players in the league this season and in my opinion, could well be Liverpool's next superstar after Suarez.

***Raheem Sterling***

One of, if not the best teenager in world football. Many thought he was going to be an Aaron Lennon-esque player - fast and tricky but without much end product but after December last season he proved pretty much everyone wrong. In the last couple of months of the season he was pretty much our star man, his goal against City oozed class, skill and he had the composure of a man many years his elder. His versatility will also be key to us, he can play on the Left, right, through the middle and also in ""the hole"", playing as a number 10 at times last season and showing top quality passing ability to go with his pace, trickery and power. Still needs to brush up on his finishing and his final ball but if nurtured properly, he's another player who could be world class at Liverpool.

***Daniel Sturridge***

2nd highest goalscorer in the league last season, yet many seem to think it was only a result of playing alongside Suarez. He was brilliant without him too. Could well increase his tally from last season with the whole team playing through him, as long as he avoids injury.

You don't even have to take it from me, just look up Carra's comments on Enrique.. Even the mere fact we are looking to sign a first choice left back of his price tag shows, by extension, Rodgers doesn't rate Enrique highly enough for the first team.

**1) How do I think this season will go?**

The obvious and tedious focal point of all the pre-season analysis is the departure of Luis Suarez but I think outsiders will be surprised how quickly the fanbase have turned the page.  In our heart of hearts we've known this was coming for a long time and now we can look forward.  In my eyes, Suarez was a happy accident, a standout performer in a team designed to work together as a single entity.  In the aftermath Rodgers has continued to expand the squad and bring in players with attributes favourable to his playing style.  At times last season we were simply unplayable and in those moments it was our entire team working in harmony that blew teams away, not Luis Suarez working on his own.  With a deeper squad and more players chosen by Rodgers to play his style I expect another successful season.  Finishing in the top four should be our benchmark and I believe it to be a realistic target.  Our defence should be more certain and assured with the addition of Lovren, return of Enrique and signings of Moreno and Manquillo which should account for a portion of Suarez's 31 goals simply by conceding less.

**STERLING**

There aren't enough superlatives for Raheem Sterling.  He plays with the confidence of a far more experienced player and with every reason.  He has lightning pace, impeccable footballing intelligence, great vision and a faultless touch.  Not to mention his surprising strength.  He has improved so much in the last two seasons one can only wonder what he can achieve in his third.

**STURRIDGE**

When he came to Liverpool he had something to prove.  Not good enough for City or for Chelsea he was determined to show what they were missing out on, and he did.  Now the world's wondering if he can fill Luis Suarez's boots, many are doubting him.  Big mistake.

**GERRARD**

It feels odd to talk about a 33 year old player improving.  We were all dubious when Rodgers placed Gerrard in his new, deeper role.  In fact, his first game was terrible.  Since then he's improved a great deal and continues to do so.  For better or worse watching Gerrard's continued development in the role will be something worth watching.  One of the world's greatest adjusting to a new position at the age of 33.

true,retroshark,cnty-england,England,"Dude trust me... I feel you on the depression. I've had chronic depression/major depressive disorder since my early teens. The self loathing and constant negative self affirmations about how people view you and what they are (in your mind) certainly thinking about you; it's enough to drive anyone to total isolation. 

Have you sought treatment? I know it may be daunting, but after almost a decade of therapy, I'm a different person. I'm still depressed, but at the very least I don't think about suicide on a daily basis. I can't say enough how much therapy has helped me. More than drugs, alcohol or sex ever did. 

That aside, I happen to have quite a few very dear friends who like myself are all depressed. Some of them can directly relate to my personal struggle whilst the others have a slightly different story. The fact is that at any one time there will always be one of us on an upswing. I find that my closest of these friends can offer a very objective perspective on my thoughts and feelings even in times of struggle for him. Also a major component to my friendships with other sufferers is that because we have very specific personal boundaries, and often times a lot of trust issues and great need for personal space and cooling off periods after socialising, we all sort of know that if the other person is out of touch for a few days or maybe a week we always kindly check in on one another. Not in a prying way, just sort of reaching out to let the other know we are still there and also sometimes to try to uplift the other to a point where they may be open to you coming round to visit. 

I find that if I show these friends the special compassion that I myself desire, it generally helps greatly towards a fruitful relationship for both parties. It's one thing to be depressed and lonely, however sometimes depression is easier to deal with when you're going through it with a friend.

Certainly a fan favourite for a lot of people it seems... he's young, English and good-looking so it's not particularly hard I guess ;)

He has scored some good goals for Brighton during his time here and will go down as a cult-hero regardless simply because of his two goals vs. Doncaster (first ever league match at Amex).

Overall, he could well be a good signing for Sunderland if they are looking to develop the attack as a unit. To emphasise my point, look at Raheem Sterling two years ago when he just came onto the pitch and dribbled around (exciting but not productive) and compare that to how he currently has a more specific role and is far more productive as a result.

That's not what I've said at all. The whole point of sending someone to prison is that the crime they have committed is so bad, that we feel the need for them to be separated from society while they are rehabilitated.

You wouldn't want a murderer living in a house next door to you while he is being rehabilitated, which is why we build prisons for them to stay in, so they can be kept away from the general public. 

Would you want someone just convicted of a crime and serving a jail sentence serving on a jury if you were the defendant? Probably not, you would argue that they were in no position to make that kind of judgement, at least until they had finished their sentence and finished rehabilitation. 

Why then, would anyone consider a convicted prisoner, still not yet rehabilitated, and so unfit to live in the community, to work safely amongst others, unable to sit on a jury, why would anyone think it was right that that person have a say who the local political representative was?

**Sturridge** - This might seem obvious but this is the biggest year in his career, in my opinion. He is now the main man. There is no one above him on the pecking order for the striker position. You can tell my his body language and comments over the years that this is what he's always wanted and now that he has it, he has to prove he's made for it and I think he will.

**Sterling** - Again, this is a pretty self-explanatory choice. An incredibly young player who is already making waves. There is absolutely no limit to how good Raheem Sterling can become given that he is only 19 years of age.

**Coutinho** - With the inevitable change in system this year, we need Coutinho to up his game another level to provide more even more creativity going forward. We won't be throwing bodies forward like crazy any more and as such, the weight on the shoulders of the creative players has been increased. He needs to step up just like Sturridge only I'm less sure of his ability to do that. I'm not saying he's going to flop because he's too intelligent a player to do that but it will be, in many ways, a make or break season for Coutinho. It wouldn't be impossible in my mind, if his shooting and finishing doesn't improve, to see a similar situation Mata ran into at Chelsea. He's still young and when players are still young you give them a bit of leeway in the rough areas of their game but at some point, he needs to stop being so wasteful in front of goal by dragging shots 10 metres wide.

Even if Murray isn't spectacular, I have full faith that he's good enough for our needs.

Wilf didn't refuse to join us, he wasn't allowed to.

3 different Manchester United managers? As in Ferguson, who he never actually played under because Ferguson rightly thought leaving him to develop at us was a better idea? Moyes was overwhelmed at United, I'm not sure we can lend much credence to that theory. And all through pre-season LVG has played a formation without wingers, which is why Nani's being shipped off, so that's no black mark against Wilf.

I watched him at Cardiff, in the flesh. He was not 'a bit crap'. At times he was the only spark of inspiration, the only one who could actually beat anyone - and considering his trickery worked, I'd be loathe to criticise it - so why not give him a chance?

We know he's got a lot of potential. He needs game time to unlock it. Why not give him a chance? If he fails, well, it was nice having him back and he can go back to being United's problem.

Even if the vote is close, its still disappointing that half the voters can't see Skrtels quality. i feel like its primarily a ""hive-mind"" decision because judging off last season and this preseason, Skrtel has clearly been the better defender, but Sahko gets so much hype on this subreddit.

true,Lastaria,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"Well it was being run by the Americans at this point. So assuming it got a series we have to wonder if even then it would have made it past the first series. American television companies can be kinda brutal, if the viewing figures fall they will axe ruthlessly and move onto the next thing without letting it grow.

However there is another factor here that might have saved it. There are a number of North American based series that would have been axed were it not for international audiences and in particular UK audiences saving them

Some examples are Babylon 5, Due South and 24. All were ready to be axed early on or midway through their runs but they got huge audiences in they UK to the tune of several million to make the companies decide it was variable to continue with them which also helped the domestic figures for them grow as they were allowed to develop.

24 set its latest series in London as a thank you for the UK audiences saving it as a little piece of trivia.

So taking this on board there is a good chance it could be saved. You are getting a very large UK viewing as well as a decent sized audience from Australia and Canada. A pilot is one thing where they may just ditch it like they did, get a series under their belt and they will really look at the viewing figures.

So lets say it continues through to today. 18 years I believe which would be incredible for a series made in the US. If it did I suspect you would not have a turnover of Doctors as quickly as in the UK. I suspect contracts would be drawn up for a certain amount of series with possibility of renewal. I suspect a US audience may not be as used to the main character changing so they would not want to do it as often. Probably pretty lucrative for the actor too who may be happier to remain in the role awhile and still be able to try out movies when they are not filming the series.

So I am going to go with an average time per Doctor of 5 years.

So you're earning &gt;£46k, but still renting in a house share and living like an upmarket student?  I'm sure you're perfectly happy with this, but it really says it all about London and you're definitely far from being alone :|

I know people on just over half your salary in the same position, and you hear of Banker Boys on £600k a year who are renting some £1500-2000pcm bachelor pad in Canary Wharf.  On that kind of money it should be a less-than-no-brainer to save up a deposit and buy somewhere... but that's not how it works in London.

I live an hour from London also working in technology.  £33k a year, but I've got a two bed flat with master en-suite and marked parking bay all to myself for £600pcm.  I'm definitely not interested in piling into a Clapham fag packet paying more than that for a single room.

&gt; It was a household decision not to pay the line rental up front.

Fair enough, but it would have got you 14-15 months for the price of a year.

&gt; TV license, forgot about that. £145.50/year (Note, you don't have to pay this if you don't have a TV in the house at all).

Split between the three of you, that's £48.50 a year.  Perfectly reasonable I guess.

&gt; No insurance… though I've been thinking about getting it. The NHS does cover all things, though it's pretty slow.

I've got very cheap tenant contents insurance and I've got a car costing £350 a year to insure.  No private healthcare of any kind for me, sadly.

1) I'm actually Australian, and while I can possibly, if I chose to right now, put down the deposit for a decent flat in London (with a blow to my current lifestyle), I choose not to because I already own two properties in Melbourne, Australia and thus already have two mortgages. I will return to Oz one day, just not yet.

2) I choose to live with people because I live with 2 of my best friends, not because I can't afford to live alone. I hate living alone – did it for years.

3) I love living in London. I don't really care about material goods, everything I own can be packed into two suitcases. The mortgages are investments, not because I'm particularly attached to them. I have never owned a car in my life and don't intend to until I have a family, so I have no need of a parking bay. Instead, I want adventure, experiences and memories, I like living small so that if I wanted to, I could move to Berlin tomorrow. Or Vietnam. Or South America. But right now, I like London. I like being in the middle of it all. :)

I think it will go fairly well but my expectations are tempered in comparison with last season. Top 4 finish, deep runs in domestic cups, and a potentially short Champions League campaign due to the potential group possibilities.

2. Which 3 players should other fans watch out for and why?

**Coutinho** - Going to take it to yet another level. This is going to be the season where he takes over as our best overall player. A great mix of tenacity, audacious passing, and SWAGGER.

**Sterling** - If you are a fan of another team prepare to feel absolutely helpless. Sterling is going to make your defenders look like fools on the regular. His skill level is really beginning to catch up with his speed and that's bad news if you aren't wearing red.

**Henderson** - Henderson is about to ruin the life of whomever has the ball at their feet. He's the best on-ball presser in the league and acts like he has eaten bad Indian food because he has the case of the runs always. This guy never. EVER. Stops. Hide your women* and children**, Henderson is about to be the human embodiment of The Mighty Ducks all on his own. (*hair products, **the rest of your hair products)

The police don't and won't deal with noise complaints that is for the council to deal with (Good luck getting them to do anything about it though!).

They won't be able to do anything about the dog in the shed.

However it's not, it's a mistreated dog.

It is the RSPCA who need to deal and it will take a long time but that is sadly just the way things are these days.

I wouldn't bother going in to the front office of your local station with picture etc because frankly it would be a waste of your time. They'll ask you to ring the RSPCA.

---
&gt;
&gt;__Death's Head__ was a metallic life-form who worked as a ""freelance peacekeeping agent"" (effectively, a mercenary, bounty hunter and assassin, though he hated being called any of those things) in a number of dimensions and time zones. Death's Head described himself as a mechanoid, a designation not related to the Mechanoids, the enemies of the Daleks.
&gt;Death's Head did not take pleasure in killing, merely in being professional and financially astute, and possessed a rather pedantic personality. He was a habitual traveller between alternate realities, spending most of his career in universes other than the main one. At the time that he first encountered the Seventh Doctor, Death's Head had been enlarged to nine metres in height.  
&gt;While travelling through the Time Vortex, Death's Head collided with the Doctor's TARDIS, forcing both to materialise. Death's Head attacked the Doctor, but was shot with a TCE and returned to his original size apparently uninjured. The Doctor eventually used the TARDIS to launch the mechanoid through time and space to the planet Earth in the year 8162.

- don't overcommit to players on one team. all teams have off moments

- don't buy really cheap subs that wont play. it's worth investing in cheapish players that do play regularly so you can cope with injuries

- don't spend too much on defense. have maybe two 6+ mil defenders and then a bunch of cheap rotation options

- buy one good starting keeper that will play every match and one 4.0m keeper

- try and build value in your team, so that you can afford a better more expensive team later on in the season. thus its sometimes useful to jump on a player bandwagon even if you dont think they are going to get a lot of points

- plan ahead. look what fixtures a team has and plan accordingly

I think our chances at a title run this season are the same as they were this time last summer - close to zero. Last season was a big surprise and I don't expect it to happen again. I imagine fierce competition for 3rd and 4th. Maybe a run at a cup, and not sure how CL will go because the group draw isn't out yet, but we'll probably win it all.

2. 
**Sterling** - Creative, fast and always a threat. It's just exciting to watch him play

  **Coutinho** - Will be the primary creative force up front now with Suarez gone. He really does some magically things with the ball, and seems so close to really breaking out as one of the best creators in the league, hopefully he manages it this season.

  **Lovren** - Biggest defensive addition, so he should make the biggest improvement to overall results for Liverpool. Seems poised to anchor our defense and also feed some balls to the attackers from deep. Really excited to see how he changes us defensively.

 Honourable mention: Sturridge, excited to see how he will take on the role of primary goal scorer.

3. http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=421r - Sakho, Moreno and Flanagan will start often too.

Or we start of really bad and then get in gear to achieve CL future. I agree, this season we were lucky that Manchester United had a terrible season to their standards, Spurs lost their best player and transfer market dealings weren't the best. And then of course, after we lost 3-0 it was looking very unlikely we were going to get it. However we got our ass in gear and you got unlucky, this season I think the top 6-7 will be very competitive. And with the intent of signing Lukaku and especially if (I'm pretty sure it's going to happen?) you get Atsu, I think you can get a CL place.

In return for you kind words, the thing I love about Everton is your talent producing. For example, Rooney and Barkley. I think your Manager Martinez is amazing, and will bring Everton lots of trophies. Also, your new signing Muhamed Bešić I didn't see anything other than those amazing touches, but damn they were good.

On Bristol specifically, I was going to add Dick's Climbing (to OSM and coinmap at the same time) but I've not been yet and wouldn't want to violate the OSM prime directive of ""don't copy from other maps"".  I hear there's a café somewhere up Whiteladies too.  I'd imagine independents, charity shops and stuff near the uni would be first.  There aren't many places I buy from around here, and the one place I do use completely ignored me when I pledged a year's custom if they'd accept payment in Bitcoin.

&gt; I do not understand why after so much publicity and how easy and free it is to set up a wallet why more places are not accepting Bitcoin?

Probably because what they'd save on fees/chargebacks would be very easily lost in the volatility, so they don't want to take the risk of holding it.  BitPay and friends that convert on receipt either have very high minimum withdrawals (£1000) or just don't service the UK, probably owing to ongoing UK bank frostiness towards Bitcoin-related businesses.

I'd also like to see more restrictions on second home expenses, maybe even abolishing them entirely and instead providing adequate London based properties instead, allowing for tighter control and less abuse of the expenses granted to them.

I sometimes have to travel for work for extended periods, and I certainly don't get to choose where I stay, but because my work generally rents out a decent place with adequate transport links, pays all of the expenses involved, and grants me an additional fixed amount per day I'm travelling that more than covers my costs, I have no complaints. Pretty much the only costs I might expense would be travel costs, assuming that my place of work hasn't organised travel for me.

So I don't see why we can't just assign MPs a place to live and fixed costs, with additional claimed expenses only going on travel.

**Markovic** is going to be a cog that fits nicely into our set-up. In a position where we have lots of talented attackers, Lazar's aggressiveness on offense is something we needed to replace after Suarez left. His speed is only bettered by his ability to beat defenders one on one in any situation. His offensive workrate will have teams terrified of him coming on late in the game. 

**Manquillo** is expected to take over for Johnson. If this is true and he gets plenty of game time the world will see exactly why he's a younger Jordi Alba. Assists from his side of the field should be plentiful this season and maybe even Johnson will play better knowing he's not guaranteed starter anymore. 

**Allen** isn't the biggest name, first choice or even second choice. With Lallana, Henderson, Gerrard, Çan, &amp; Lucas all playing similar positions it's easy to forget about him. But Allen is still one of the best long range passers on the team, brilliant through ball specialist and I believe he'll shine more this season with all our attacking players making runs and opening up opportunities for him to feed them.

The last sentence was maybe a bit lighthearted. In all seriousness, it's better to be a selling club and have this scale of talent for a few years than not. Young, talented players come to us knowing they'll move, and while that sounds like a bad thing, who would turn down a massive club like Barca or Real?

true,GoonSquad44,num42,,"For me it is an understandable gesture. While I have enjoyed his play the last couple of years, I can see why Levy/Poch want to send him on his way. 

For me it is a couple of things: 

1. He doesn't really fit the system Poch is trying to implement. Poch needs quick thinking and mobile midfielders. Something which Dembele really is not. Or at least is down the pecking order. 

2. Holtby comes before him in both Offensive creativity and work rate. They play a similar role and, in my opinion, Holtby is a bit better in all aspects(other than maybe size). 

3. Watching him last season was especially frustrating for me because I feel as though he doesn't match the intelligence/creativity of our other midfielders. He needs to be able to read the play makers' (Eriksen) mind to the point where the build up is going and I often found that Dembele was never able to reach that point. He was almost always at least 1 or 2 steps behind where Eriksen needed him to be. In Poch's high pressure system, Dembele is going to fall behind because he won't be performing at the same level as our week to week midfield regulars (Eriksen, Lamela, Holtby, Capoue, Townsend/Lennon). 

4. Excess of Central Midfielders. In terms of our CMs/DMs, I would rank Dembele in the lower half. I rate Holtby, Capoue, Paulinho, and Sandro all above him.

In fact, much sooner on any throwaway Reddit account I use, or forum, or anywhere else period. Some of the leaps I've seen in the past day over things I've said has literally left me sat there literally incredulous like...''what....are you actually kidding me? how did you even take xxx in that way all of a sudden?''.

In honesty, fear of her losing her final salary pension for something inferior. As cynical as it sounds I can't imagine the new scheme will be as good as the final salary scheme and we were worried that they'd rail road the final salary scheme and 'convert' it to the new scheme. 

Most of this is bourn from pension/info seeming intimidating! We were worried that the new scheme would be inferior and the old final salary scheme would be rail roaded and blended in to the new :S

The general concept is the same in both cases - the more copper wire you've got, the greater the resulting signal degradation, and hence the lower the speed you can get.

Where FTTP is available (it's not everywhere, and can be expensive where it is) then the fibre does indeed run straight into your house, and ludicrous speeds are to be expected.

FTTC is the norm, though. Your speed will vary, depending on the distance to the cabinet - in my case, the cabinet is some distance away and so I'm getting rather slower speeds than the 70+Mb/s some people report, but they're still considerably faster than I was getting on normal ADSL.
