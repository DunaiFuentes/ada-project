true,orwellsocietyguy,null,null,"&gt; This has got to be the only time in history that someone who is so anti religion has actually DEFENDED recording data on Christianity.

What? No. What am I defending? You're getting more and more abstract.

&gt;The Catholic church only records attendance, not who Identify as a Catholic.

They pay an independent body to do it they're called The Pastoral Research Centre Trust, an independent research organisation. The National Secular Society and The National Centre for Social Research also do their own number and they're LOWER. THE BHA and YouGov also did similar polls. The numbers aren't hugely different but they're LOWER. So take the highest number to be MORE than fair to them. It still only shows one thing - Catholics are over represented VASTLY more than muslims.

&gt;If this was any other situation, such as the Census you would be screaming from the rooftops

No I wouldn't, I'd be tutting as people like yourselves read too much in to a flawed poll. Of the 53% who identify as Christian in England only 29% of those say ""they are religious"" and ""believe in Jesus"".(Source March 2011 YouGov Poll) But have your 50% - it only works against your paper thin argument. 

The census has nothing to do with this. With 1 million attendance around 4 million is about right. You're either being deliberately dim or you're using ""we can't possibly know"" as an argument and it's stupid.

&gt; What I asked you was where did you get your figures from on the number of CATHOLICS in the UK, because that information is NOT recorded on the census.

Read the above. Google it. There's multiple sources. You really think we can't even begin to know how many Catholics in the UK?

&gt; if you are getting your figures from the Catholic church itself you are going to be making judgements on poor quality information.

It's not going to be WILDLY wrong. It's going to be HIGH which works in their favour and I'm slanting it towards their high numbers and it STILL shows that catholics are vastly higher than muslims.

You've lost this argument by being ridiculous.

&gt; It doesn't make any sense.

You don't make any sense. You've taken the prison population as a measure of ALL crime which is the most absurd thing I've heard all week. You then whelp on about Muslims but not about Catholics. You then go on to desperately defend them despite a multiple research, links and polls being shown to you.

The Met police, global UK corps, the army, faith schools, car drivers, football teams, churches, banks, the NHS, charities, utility firms, celebrities, newspapers, construction companies, the arms industry, drug companies, MP's - all committing tens of thousands of crimes of varying scales on a daily basis. They don't end up in prison or in your incredibly limited view of why people commit crime.

Yes, less than half of the country wouldn't get what they wanted this referendum. That's how a representative democracy works. The difference is that with the referendum they will be overruled by the majority of people who otherwise vote similarly in general elections, which means they have more similar values.

In general elections the entirety of Scotland more or less votes for one side of politics, and gets overruled fairly often by people in the south of England who have quite different values and therefore voting habits.

The democracy of the referendum is fairer (more representative) than the democracy of the elections it will change.

I have to say, though, it's a bafflingly half-baked notion of independence that wants to opt back in immediately to the institutions at the heart of the union you just left. If you want to be independent, you set up new institutions you don't beg back into old ones. Sure, you get your fair share of cash/debt and easily divisible assets, but you're a sovereign nation so just create a Central Bank of Scotland and create a Scottish Pound, or Groat or Dubloon or whatever. I just don't see why on earth anyone would think that it would be realistic to demand equal access to another country's currency. A 'Yes' vote doesn't create two new countries, it creates one new one (independent Scotland) and one existing one (rUK, to whom the pound and bank of England belong).

It's a little vague on that point, I suppose.  But you are right that it says ""between his twelfth and final"" regenerations, or possibly it uses the word ""incarnations"", not sure.  My only answer to that is that it's the Master who describes him that way, so it's debatable how accurate he was being.  I do still think he's a more likely choice than anyone else, unless there's something we completely haven't seen (from between the Metacrisis Doctor and Eleven).

Either way, I have to say, I REALLY hope that they do address that soon.  That particular plot thread can't just be ignored or retconned out--it was such a major part of Six's arc--and it's been just DANGLING there for all these years!  So I want to see it portrayed in some way.  Preferably soon.

I think we all want to see upsets and success stories (e.g. many people loves the Southampton narrative last year, and feel for them this year); the fact that all teams should have a (reasonable) chance of winning once they step on the field is one of the reasons people love sport, FFP is not helping with that.",0,1410316886,null,0,false,0,cke1wcr,t3_2fy29e,t1_cke1wcr,t1_ckdt5t8,null,1427098690,3,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,3

true,midnightking,null,null,"I have 2 problems with Doctor Who,but I can live with what you talked about about.

**Plot inconsistencies**

This is by far the biggest problem in Doctor Who in my opinion.Consistency and the internal logic of a universe permit me to suspend my disbelief and tell myself I am looking at another world,it allows me to not get confused by knowing that the events will progress in a somewhat sensible manner and I can then , based on what I know, have fun trying to figure out how the good guys will enact their plan to win.

DW robs me of that.Time travel just works in whichever way is convenient for the writers of the episode. The Doctor can't save Rory and Amy because he has foreknowledge of them living out their lives in N.Y. ,it doesn't matter if in Waters Of Mars he saved two people which he knew would die,it doesn't matter if In Journey To The Center Of The Tardis he prevents the plot of the episode by going back in his own timeline and it does not matter if in A Christmas Carrol he spends the whole episode going back in time to correct somebody's childhood,etc.He can't save Rory and Amy and you are just told to accept this arbitrary assertion and shut up about it.

11 is the last regeneration,it doesn't matter if he oozed regeneration energy and was starting to regenerate at the beginning of series 6 and that he gave regeneration energy to River.

50 years is no excuse to contradict events that happened just few episodes/season ago.While I know that writing Time Travel is hard,Doctor Who mainly uses it as a setting-maker,meaning that the stories don't have to involve it beyond just placing the Doctor at a certain spot.

**Bad Villainy**

The Daleks and Cybermen aren't compelling villains.They are pretty much just the ""Kill All Human"" archetype with a conversion twist.One dimensional as they are, the characters can never be truly compelling  due to their overall lack of personality beyond their generic goals.Add to that they are supposed to be scary and yet are almost completely incapable of killing the main characters that the audience identifies with.

They often come off as extremely cheesy,as they remind us of what we thought robots/cyborgs would be like in the 1960s,mainly due to there voice which makes Siri sound like a genius.

Aside from the villains,Doctor Who has this annoying tendency of creating bad moral dilemmas.The question ""Is Dexter Morgan a good man?"" is a good one because Dexter does a lot of good and a lot of bad both intentionally and he even says that his motives aren't always for the greater good.The question ""Is the Doctor a good man?"" isn't good and is played out.

He kills serial killers who prey on the innocent therefore saving innocents indirectly, but he also killed 3 innocent people, tried to kill Laguerta for uncovering him and framed Doakes.

He murdered a pedophile,but he also spared a serial killer simply because he boned her.

He goes after the killers which have evaded the law,but he also derails said law to be able to kill them himself.

But furthermore,we don't know if the killers can be rehabilitated as they are HUMANS.Daleks are pretty much built to be sociopaths.

The problem with Doctor Who is that it tries too hard to paint situations as moral dilemmas when they are not to most people.Most people understand that killing isn't always bad, if you are defending yourself or protecting people from death then no one thinks you are a monster for it. A person who would say that this guy is a monster for shooting a guy as he was about to rape/brutalize a woman would be seen as pretty unstable and as having unhealthy black and white morality.

But DW wants you to believe meta-ten was wrong for killing the daleks when they planned on killing all creation, DW wants you to believe that Ten killing the Racnoss before it went on to eat and kill the whole human population was bad, DW wants you to believe that the Cybermen shouldn't of been killed even know they are pretty much programmed to be killing/lobotomizing machines and they will keep on doing so as long as they are alive,DW wants you to think the Doctor hating the Daleks is wrong even though any person in his situation would rightfully hate them,DW wants you to believe saving a crew of people on Mars is less important than holding up the rules even when the Doctor tells a woman how to stay alive and still inspire her granddaughter, etc.",0,1410329920,null,0,1410354883,0,cke6j34,t3_2fz5bb,t1_cke6j34,t3_2fz5bb,null,1427096407,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

Not only that, but consider guys like Costa who has just scored 4 in his first 3 games. Obviously Costa *costa* fair bit more, but the point i'm making is it's not impossible for a top quality player to come in and hit the ground running. It is definitely not unreasonable that Soldado should be at least scoring a few goals after 14 odd months. Comparing some stats:

- Soldado - 28 - 6 goals in first season.
- Giroud - 25 - 11 goals in his first season, 
- Suarez - 24 - 10 goals in his first 12 months 
- Bony - 24 - 16 goals in his first season

Then you have to consider that Soldado scored 4 penalties. Suarez and Giroud were both not penalty takers. I can't find stats on how many pens Bony scored, but let's assume 4 goals from penalties. These three strikers scored 5 times more from open play in their first season, despite being at least 3 years younger at the time of transfer.

For guys like Lamela, we paid a lot for potential, if he had another average season this year, you'd still give him a bit of hope, but when you buy a 28 year old striker, you're not investing in the future. 14 months is more than long enough to find your feet if you're a 28 year old, 26m pound signing.",0,1410331532,null,0,false,0,cke6xku,t3_2fxznl,t1_cke6xku,t1_cke66at,null,1427096219,14,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,14

I also use examples like BitcoinLady in Botswana, who works within communities there to help women (who often don't have access to traditional banking) sell items they have made on sites like Etsy and set up btc addresses.

It's not really the people's fault, well - it is, in that they've been the ones voting in the terrible politicians that have brought us all down this road, but the reality is that, generally, everyone's just fed up, with all of it - the outdated bollix surrounding the Royal family, English self-superiority, London-centric thinking, lunatic right wing politicians, wealth inequality, a two-tier social system that no one outside England can even begin to identify with, the list goes on...

Ultimately, this is all still in the balance and if the English (and their politicians) want to learn from the experience, now would be the time to do it. But no, what will happen is, if Scotland do vote 'No,' the English will see this as a major victory and rub everyone's noses in it. Just watch.

You're making an assumption that a law that isn't law yet is stopping us from having a US style situation.

It isn't law (or if it is, it is extremely recent), but that has not prevented our ISPs from behaving relatively well for the last few years. There was/is nothing to stop them going down the US path (and indeed, some revisions of the EU law don't ban paid peering or traffic shaping). What has really prevented them is less about a kneejerk piece of recent EU legislation, and more to do with the fact that we have much more competition and shitty ISPs can be moved away from in days, whereas the US has no real competition.

Verizon and Comcast are the ones who have been accused of bad tactics. Our equivalent of those (BT and Virgin) have been peering freely with Netflix, the BBC and many others for some time, and they have not implemented traffic shaping based on where the traffic came from (any traffic shaping tends to affect entire protocols).

This is my point. The EU law would not change much because we haven't been having the problems the US has had, and if we left the EU this is unlikely to change.

I think people are suggesting that Sky should be paying the PSB broadcasters for a service Sky itself does not profit from (since the channels are transmitted free to air, the same video streams are used for Freesat, and you can use a Sky box without subscription to watch them). Some people compare this with Ireland, where the Irish channels are encrypted, and until 2012 or so, you had to pay Sky for the privilege of watching RTE on satellite.

Sky in the 90s didn't have any PSB channels on it at all (until Channel 5 launched) and Sky Digital didn't have ITV on it for a number of years. Didn't seem to hurt its growth.

I suspect an element of ""I hate Sky and love my BBC"" comes into it, and ITV just wants money. Viewers already pay the transmission costs as part of the licence fee or ad revenue.

There's no reason why Sky should be allowed to charge outrageous rates as they have done in the past (until Ofcom told them to cut it down), but at best it should be free for both sides (which for Sky is simply just a position in the programme guide, it's not really retransmission - a bit more like the difference between BBC getting the bbc.co.uk domain name for free, and expecting someone to host their website and iPlayer for free). 

I don't think ITV should be allowed that though - they say they are a public service broadcaster when it suits them, but otherwise they ignore or get Ofcom to reduce their PSB requirements (regional programming) the rest of the time.",0,1410334359,null,0,1410334666,0,cke7kbn,t3_2fz8bu,t1_cke7kbn,t3_2fz8bu,null,1427095924,2,false,BritishTV,t5_2rzot,2

There are about ten million other messages which are being made to people in more engaging ways which they will listen to instead. 

And they aren't wrong to do so, if a person hasn't made the minimal effort to present their message well, then it shows they are either incompetent or lazy. And in both cases, it is an indication that the message is probably not that important. 

Therefore you have two choices, either the message more interesting so when the BBC chooses to broadcast it for free, people are interested in it. Or pay for the air time so your message is not left to the discretion of editors. 

If the TUC is unwilling to do either of these simple things, then it cannot complain when its message is interrupted by events which people are interested in.

Salmond cannot even tell you with certainty what cash you will be earning or spending, whether you will be in the EU or trying to get in, or what share of the Oil money will eventually land in your coffers. That's unacceptable for a man who claims to have the answers.

Therefore there is no case to answer - although that does not mean that nothing should change. I think Scotland should have more power to shape it's own spending as suits its needs for example.

A formal currency union is a whole other thing to just using or pegging to another country's money.

I have no idea but if not then there is no fractional reserve banking, no ability to increase M4 money supply, no ability to raise sovereign debt against future tax receipts. And if so then the US can't stop East Timor from inflating the dollar to worthlessness by printing more. Likewise do you really think that the US has any kind of legal obligation to bail these countries out if they get in to financial trouble? Because that is what a currency union means.

somewhat of a thin diamond in the midfield. Don't have a lot of width there, but our wide players are pretty poor so I think it's better just sacrificing that element of the game. Liverpool are pretty strong in the midfield, particularly if they choose to go with just Balo up top, so let's match them by going heavy there too. They may be a little suspect defensively through the middle (with most of their mids attacking players), so Delph/Cleverley could make some inroads there. We have Zog, Grealish and Bacuna there on the bench in case we need to spread the field a bit more.

I won't be disappointed if Richardson starts though, he's been solid so far and has earned another start ahead of one of the new boys. Zog's struggled though, and I think we have better options to start right now. 3 at the back would be a decent option too (particularly to deal with the threat of Balo), but only if Okore's fit.

That being said, social media is important to all brands these days and that will only continue to grow (it's linked to from the main club website) so if anyone here knows a bit more about instagram than me I recommend you get in contact to explain how poorly these are coming across.

I'm not a fan of killing innocent people for political reasons in general, and renouncing violence doesn't, in my mind, automatically absolve you from the pain and suffering you've caused. That's as true for McGuinness as it is for Nelson Mandela. 

Gerry Adams continues to pretend he was never in the IRA. That in itself makes a mockery of the past, the troubles and his part in it. So, at least until he goes, that morally repugnant element isn't going away.

Sinn Fein, especially recently, constantly demand a place at the moral high ground when it comes to shaping the country and the past - and they're not above a bit of revisionism themselves. I'm getting a bit fed up of Sinn Fein supporters in general, pushing and demanding everyone subscribe to their belief systems, be they about disparaging protestants, rewriting the IRA's history or just generally being a pack of self-righteous bellends. I'm from a mixed family, so this isn't a victimised unionist's opinion. I don't believe either side has the answer and I hate that you're expected to pick one, or even put up with either. Fuck the lot of them, in my opinion. 

That's before we even get into whether or not there's any justice for victims, when the same men who murdered their brothers/sisters/children/parents are making a pretty penny in modern politics. 

All in all, you're right about one thing - Sinn Fein aren't going away, and I think that's a great shame.

I don't see Delph or Westwood being dropped any time soon. And Sanchez will almost definitely start against better teams to better free up Delph for the counter attacking phase.

There was no mechanism by which workers could disown the union completely.

Then the union bosses would arrange elections on short notice with all their supporters informed of where the voting booth would be. Miraculously these people always got re-elected. Similar mechanisms would be used whenever strike action was called. Votes, if held at all, would be made inconvenient unless you were part of the pro-strike club.

I don't have to have a better idea to identify a bad one.

We'll take a vote on it, knives, bottles, fists (I think Darling could do well if he was desperate). Hell I'll go full Australian and jump out of a plane, onto Downing Street and strangle Cameron myself if it gets approval.

&gt; Aside from the mandatory strangling of Posh Englishmen (and the Welsh) on sight I will also be funding my science team to create a new energy saving blend of Irn Bru and Guinness for todays modern Scot on the go in an effort to forge better relations between Scotland and Ireland (which I will also take eventually). 

&gt; An annual Purge will be held on one of the more remote Orkney islands where the most dangerous men in Europe (I'm charging them, €80,000 per head) will transported there to fight for survival against you Guinness-Bru fueled junkies.

&gt; Also I promise we will host the Alcohol and Manliness Olympics in 2018, hopefully in the Highlands so the foreigners don't see any of you up close. It will mostly be between us, my Russian friend and her co-workers, and the Australian army.

&gt; And finally I would just like to say, I love Scotland, a lot. My family come's from there and it shares the no.1 spot with Ireland as my favourite country in the world. You guy's were blessed with beautiful scenery, wonderful culture and traditions, inspiring history, and bountiful natural resources. You've got the opportunity to decide your country's future soon, I know that the decision will be a tough one and no matter if you stay or if you go things will be difficult for a while, but stuff like this doesn't come around everyday. Vote what you think is right for you, your loved one's, and your country.

Other than that, I think Soldado warrants a chance over Kane at the moment because a) he had a decent preseason, and b) he's been an absolutely deadly striker throughout his career and we're trying to play him back into form.

Think about it psychologically for him... he's one of the most feared strikers in La Liga, comes over here and bombs.  From now on, every game he sits on the bench, his confidence and morale dwindles.  Now imagine Kane starting over him... it would be that, only doubled.

Kane is still young, hungry, and has a lot to prove.  Him starting on the bench at this stage in his career is not just fair, it's to be expected.  His confidence and morale won't ebb away if he spends this season on the bench behind two big name, big money strikers.  Should Adebayor and Soldado habitually misfire, then yes Kane deserves a shot.  But we all know what Soldado actually CAN do when he's on song, and putting him third in the pecking order behind Kane only lowers our chances of ever seeing that Soldado in the Lilywhite.

When did our balls drop off and roll under the sofa? When did we lose our voice to say “get with the fucking programme, consensual homosexuality is fine and harms no-one – you’re living in the dark ages.” 

&gt; I don't have to have a better idea to identify a bad one.

You don't have to - but it would really help your case. You do have to justify it though – simply saying ‘that’s bad’ is a cop-out. 

&gt; You'd best get to Dubai then. For a start.

Can we not discuss and admit the faults in multiple cultures at once? Russia has recently been widely criticised for its handling of homosexuality - now here's China - Dubai (since you mention it) has its own issues. 

The existance of one doesn't mean we should ignore any of the others. Are we that one-track-minded? 

&gt; That's up to their country and social setup. Ireland still doesn't allow abortions - why not start there?

See above. *This* topic is about homosexuality - if you want to discuss Ireland and abortions then feel free to start a thread and we'll have a chat about it. 

&gt; but we've been here before, and strong-arming other countries... 

Fair enough, but I don't think that means we should give up on pushing the world - or giving it a firm shove where appropriate - towards being a better place to be *for everyone*. 

Hoping generation by generation that some countries will 'catch up' and stop stoning each other, honor killing, persecuting women or homosexuals etc... well it's a hell of a long game. I'm not prepared to sit down and shut up if someone is shouting that anything like that is OK - so it is here with the Chinese and this 'culture'.

No, that wasn't what I was referring to at all, and actually, I'd be all for all those things you mentioned, so, frankly, fuck knows where you're getting any of that that from. Unless you were being ironic or something...

I guess this the danger when two sides have such a huge majority rule, anyone with an opposing opinion must surely be automatically a stooge of one or the other! There's no way someone could possibly have an independent opinion, right?

I was referring specifically to the suggested proposals to invoke mechanisms that would have put in place restrictions on peaceful protests/gatherings - which were a further extension of the already ludicrous ones that were introduced after 9/11 by the Blair government.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;Not really. There’s a plethora of teaching and diplomatic techniques that could be applied to the issue at hand.

None of which involve simply berating them for not immediately making the changes we have.

&gt;Not just us though – other countries have / are also following suit.

And lots aren't. Are they being primitive in doing so? Yes. Should we educate them? Yes. Can we demand that they follow? No.

&gt;You don't have to - but it would really help your case. 

I don't need to build a case. I've just pointed out that lambasting other countries for not being quite as advanced as we are has been tried before, and doesn't work.

&gt;simply saying ‘that’s bad’ is a cop-out.

Not when it's an approach that's been tried. I can give plenty of examples of our country sneering at others for 'not being as advanced'. So why are so many other countries still basing their law on religion, for example?

&gt;The existance of one doesn't mean we should ignore any of the others. Are we that one-track-minded?

No, we're *diplomatic*.

&gt;See above. This topic is about homosexuality - if you want to discuss Ireland and abortions then feel free to start a thread and we'll have a chat about it.

And see my previous comment. There are many more, closer to home examples like Ireland that need addressing before we start dictating the law of a country halfway round the world.

&gt;or giving it a firm shove where appropriate - towards being a better place to be for everyone.

I agree - but I'd take the path of sanctions against countries that prosecute/ persecute married UK gay couples when they're abroad, for example. That way we're not dictating, but we are penalising countries that persecute our citizens for stuff we don't consider illegal.

&gt;I'm not prepared to sit down and shut up if someone is shouting that anything like that is OK - so it is here with the Chinese and this 'culture'

...that outnumbers us by something like twenty-to-one. I'm with you on not wanting to wait decades, but likewise expecting the world to catch up to a change we made *less than a year ago* is optimistic, to say the least.

Demonstrably untrue. On a fundamental level, no sporadic protests are allowed within a set distance of government buildings. This was done after 9/11, before that, it was possible to protest wherever, whenever and however you liked. Either you've a short memory, or you're too young to know any better. In either case, maybe you should do your homework and stop coming off with a load of uneducated shite.

Actually some teaching techniques do revolve around this psychology. 

&gt; And lots aren't. Are they being primitive in doing so? Yes. Should we educate them? Yes. Can we demand that they follow? No.

Who is demanding? Me? I'm in no position to *demand* an entire nation do anything. I can say what I think, though. 

&gt; I don't need to build a case. 

Wrong. 

&gt; I've just pointed out that lambasting other countries for not being quite as advanced as we are has been tried before, and doesn't work.

You've pointed out a lot more, but not substantiated it. 

&gt; No, we're diplomatic.

You mean self serving - but fair enough. *I* don't have to be diplomatic though - not here on Reddit. The people posting the comments in the original article aren't diplomatic either - fairs fair. We as a country could be part of a push towards better living conditions across the world, if only we'd care to be slightly less 'diplomatic'. 

&gt; And see my previous comment. There are many more, closer to home examples like Ireland that need addressing before we start dictating the law of a country halfway round the world.

So start a new thread, like I said. 

&gt; I agree - but I'd take the path of sanctions against countries that prosecute/ persecute married UK gay couples when they're abroad, for example. That way we're not dictating, but we are penalising countries that persecute our citizens for stuff we don't consider illegal.

That's a start - but we as a nation could take a leading role in not just being a huge defence supplier around the world (which we are) but also doing some good as well. We do try and be a big fish - it'd be great if we could get over ourselves and be a bit more frank about moving some nations on from their archaic beliefs. 

&gt; ...that outnumbers us by something like twenty-to-one. 

So we lobby others and don't do it alone. I agree that expecting a change in a week is unlikely - but we shouldn't mince our words either. My stance is one of 'look, we think how you do X is daft, outdated and harmful' - absolute honesty, not a demand or randsom or sanction but a simple comment. 

At least we'll garner some respect for taking a stance on something meaningful. As it is we seem to slime our way around everyone elses cultures - terrified of offending anyone.

*Go to every class.* Sounds dull, sounds well boring, but go to every class and do every assignment, even the annoying tutorial ones. There is more to life than studying, but at this moment in your life this is your main priority, give yourself the best shot. 

- Boyfriend of /u/stufstuf says! Make sure you're on top of  your work by the end of the first semester or you'll be playing catch up for the rest of your degree. 

*Get an internship*. The temptation to get a paid working gig doing some shop jobby is mighty tempting because you need the cash flow, but all my friends who did some sort of internship at university were able to walk into a job because they'd done something. I was left constantly being told no. I even had an agency laugh me out (fuck you REED) because I had no experience on there.

- Boyfriend of /u/stufstuf says! Try and get one lined up for your final semester at university. That way you'll have a company interested in you while you're on your way out. 

*Make friends with the career's advice people*. As soon as you can, find out where your CA is, and sign up for the first CV class you can. The hardest part of writing a CV is writing one so start early, even if you won't use it, the practice is good!

*Kitchen stuff*. Do you like to buy expensive pate and are you worried your roommates are shitting shitters who will eat your food? Probably right! I've lived in a dorm, house share with strangers and house share with friends. Trust. No-one. If you don't mind that it'll be eaten, then leave it out. Even if you talk to them about it, chances are someone will forget and nibble your food and forget to replace it before you notice. If you can, keep things you absolutely love in a mini fridge in your room.. or forgo keeping things for too long a time in the shared kitchen. Or cultivate a taste for things you know others hate, a guy in my block learned to love dark chocolate digestives because everyone else hated them!

- Boyfriend of /u/stufstuf says! Learn to eat super spicy food to punish those who steal from you.

*Bathroom*. Same goes for bathroom stuff tbh. Don't buy expensive shampoo and then leave it out. Someone will use it, and you'll be upset. Keep it in your room! It's a hassle, but you won't be out stuff. Also, buy flip flops! Not everyone cleans the bathroom after themselves!

- Boyfriend of /u/stufstuf says! Who leaves their stuff in the bathroom?! Don't leave your stuff in the bathroom.

He also adds. Don't sleep with anyone in Fresher's Week! You might end up seeing them really often and it might be super awkward. I agree. I full on made out with this guy in my block on the first night and that was what was on my Facebook page. Bearing in mind that was around the time FB opened up to the UK, so when people added me on FB that's pretty much all they saw of me. Wasn't a good look. Plus we weren't interested in each other AT ALL, but everyone thought it was hilarious and made it hard for us to live it down.

true,Taure,null,null,"Salmond is a canny operator. He knows that the average voter does not really understand how currencies and central banks work. He also knows that people don't really fully understand how Parliament works.

Salmond's primary concern is winning the referendum. So while he knows that these economic and political issues are complex, he also knows that pretending that they're simple and that Scotland has a strong negotiating position will help him win the vote. Once he's won the vote, *then* he can face the difficulties of the reality of an independent Scotland.

In reality, Scotland has no legal negotiating power at all. Until the Act of Parliament that creates Scottish independence is passed, Scotland remains under the control of Westminster. The powers of the Scottish Parliament are derived from the Westminster Parliament and they retain supremacy in law-making power.

The upshot of all this is that Westminster is essentially negotiating with itself the terms of an independent Scotland. The Act of Parliament which dictates the terms of Scottish independence will be passed by Westminster Parliament, and thus Westminster MPs decide what it contains.

Now, Scotland can of course simply declare itself independent and not subject to Westminster. No matter what Act Westminster passed, Scotland could ignore the legal situation and just do whatever they want. No one is going to invade them, as stated.

But the technical legal situation would still be the Act of Parliament, even if Scotland refused to recognise it, and that's the reality that international markets would follow. Finance depends on the rule of law. 

If Scotland disclaimed responsibility for debt that an Act of Parliament legally passed to them, international markets would treat that as a default. It doesn't matter what argument Scotland uses for why it shouldn't be theirs: legally, it is.

Similarly, if Scotland tried to ""fake"" a currency union without UK consent, e.g. by setting up their own central bank and saying that the currency it printed was the same as the UK pound, international markets would treat the pound printed by Scotland as a separate currency to that of the UK pound, no matter what Scotland said.

true,Undeadninjas,null,null,"The time travel being used the way it is... yeah, I'll agree with that. I like most of what Moffat has done with the series, but breaking your own rules for how time travel works, and coming up with arbitrary hooks that would change the past of the show had they been true before just because it suits a particular episode... kinda annoying. 

I deal with that internally because I figure the Doctor is not a perfect character, and doesn't actually know how the rules of time are supposed to work, especially now that the Time Lords are gone. He hasn't really explored them properly, and the more he tries to fix it, the more it tends to break. This can lead to some very poor decisions. 

Regarding the villains, once again, the Doctor isn't a perfect character, but he tries to be. His ideal of what perfection means is different than what most people would consider perfection. His ideal morality must be absolute on some level. It must be simple. It means if he gives one species a chance to live, he has to give all species a chance to live. It's something he struggles with. Sometimes he goes one way sometimes he goes the other. Usually his companion(s) keep him centered so that he never quite tips one way or another. 

The fact that these creatures are ruthless killing machines means he's very compelled to destroy them. But to paraphrase his line from _Genesis of the Daleks_, Does he have the right to commit genocide? How can anyone have that right? Even knowing what they will do, and what they are, he can't quite bring himself to destroy them. The villains don't matter, it's the Doctor that matters. The villains just make sure there's movement. 

That's how I see it. 

edit: The only thing that really bothers me, by the way, is the friggin Time War. You have two factions fully capable of time travel, using this in an attempt to annihilate one another. The entire universe is burning because of it. Their excuse for ending it doesn't make a snip of sense. They called it Time Locked. What does that mean? It's a no-fly zone for TARDIS's? He's broken every other rule at least once, why can't he show up there? Why can't he go there before the Time War? He certainly did several times in the classic series. Why can't he go back in time? He's got a Time Machine, that's what it does. The war clearly had a beginning, because there was a point in time when you could go to Gallifrey, and it wasn't all war-time. So if such a time exists, why can't you take the TARDIS and go there? So you've already been there, that's fine, show up a week later. It'd be great. He'd still be the Lord President of the High Council, and he could just take a vacation from saving everyone and be a President for a while. Why not? Who knows, maybe he did. Maybe he's already visited every place he could have gone to, and the only reason he can't go back there is because there's no place distant from where he's already been that he could go back to and not run into himself, which would be against the laws of time that he's trying so desperately to keep up even though from a technical standpoint, they cannot exist.

true,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"&gt; As it has also been made clear last season that Liverpool play best when they play with 2 strikers up-front

I have reservations about that statement. It is true when looking at a Liverpool with Suarez *and* Sturridge. But, as Suarez's early season ban showed, we can play effectively with one at the top as well. It's not about the formation: it's about finding the best formation to get the best out of the players you currently have available. 

So I don't think it is an 'A or B' scenario as the article postulates. Of the two, Lambert seems the better fit. But can 32 year-old Lambert last an entire match in a fast-paced Liverpool game? I'm not sure. Do I trust Borini to start or come on as a 60th minute substitute? No, I do not. Not as an inevitability, at least - he's a good bench option *if* the circumstances are right. 

With the players we have, playing one up top makes most sense. Let's say a 4-3-3 or a 4-2-3-1. Gerrard and Henderson in midfield are givens, Balotelli as the sole striker and then the creative AM and wings can be divided between the hive of Sterling, Lallana, Coutinho and possibly even Markovic. 

We get the best of our available players on the pitch and do not have to compromise by starting a past-his-physical-prime striker or, frankly, a highly uncertain entity.

&gt;*Go to every class.* Sounds dull, sounds well boring, but go to every class and do every assignment, even the annoying tutorial ones. There is more to life than studying, but at this moment in your life this is your main priority, give yourself the best shot. 

YES. Ok, so maybe I missed one class a semester, but no more than that. It's vital that you attend your lectures because you might miss stuff that's not in the lecture notes.

* Also, don't be afraid to speak in lectures. Maybe it's just because I was a little older when I started uni but I turned into a bit of a Hermione in lectures - maybe don't go to that extreme but don't sit there in silence in the back of the room. Lecturers like it if you ask and answer questions - besides, the lecturers who knew me were much more willing to give me help when I needed it! Don't be afraid of them. Show an interest in their subject and it'll get you far. (unless it's really boring, in which case grin and bear it)

* Regarding befriending your lecturers, if you want to work in the field of whatever you're studying, the more networking you do the better. Go to talks, mixers, lectures organised by your event. Do extracurricular stuff. We organised regular talks by lecturers in and around our department and it's a great thing to put on a CV/masters application. My friend got to know one of her lecturers, who put in a good word for her with a friend in the industry, and she got a job out of it. Just don't sleep with them.

* If you're one of the few with a Blackberry phone, please for the love of god don't use it during lectures. In first year those phones were all the rage and I couldn't sit in lectures without being surrounded by constant tapping noises. Drove me mad. If you are going to use your phone in lectures, keep quiet and don't distract others.

* Don't talk in lectures. DON'T TALK IN LECTURES. 

some more general uni tips:

* If there isn't one already, start a Facebook group for your course and class (e.g. Uni of Neverland, Playdoh Science 2014-2017). we had one of these and it was invaluable for checking deadlines, sharing tips, asking questions and generally supporting each other. I used to post cat gifs to keep everyone's motivation up.

* Perhaps this isn't true for every course, but in my experience, don't rush out and buy all the textbooks immediately. I did this in first year and barely used any of them. I found that most of the books I needed were available digitally or in the library, and often you could get by without using them at all. I mainly revised from lecture notes and journal articles.

* Finally, if you're *really* not happy, don't just sit there, change something. I started at a different uni doing a different course and it was dreadful - it was a language course where they cancelled all the orals because of budget cuts (wtf) so we had no dedicated speaking practice. I learnt so little in that year. I made up my mind that I wanted to leave about halfway through the year but they persuaded me to stay - instead of getting out of there with what's known as a ""false start"", I stayed til the end and got saddled with a whole years tuition fees for that year where I learnt nothing. That said, make sure you talk to your adviser, talk to lecturers and make sure you're making the right decision. It was only after I was really struggling in one class and the lecturer basically told me I was on my own that I knew it wasn't right for me. I left, changed course and uni, and had the best time ever. Don't do a shit degree because you feel you should. you'll do badly and get nothing out of it.

Sky doesn't own the satellites, just their platform.... you can watch the free to air channels on those satellites with a bog standard receiver or a system like Freesat

What they pay Sky for is the EPG space - which legally Sky must let them or any other broadcaster who wants it have. They pay a bit more than pay channels because they're free to air however they also pay a bit more because they are regionalised. The BBC in particular has about 30 EPG slots to pay for - there's about 15 versions of BBC1 and radio channels

However because their channels appear on Sky (and Virgin cable) the argument is that Sky are benefiting in some way because they are popular channels appearing as part of their package.

I don't really get the argument myself, all they are paying for is distribution, just like any other method.

Text books are the biggest scam ever! Don't buy them right away. Wait till the second week see how much they've referred to it in the module handbook.

Some other universities put textbooks online for free. So google the name of your textbook with PDF you might find a version of your textbook! There are other online sites you can use to find a copy of your textbook.

Libertarianism relies on an acceptance that humans will be motivated mostly only by self interest - and to design a society that works with, rather than against that plain fact.

It also treats government intervention as force - we all know democracy is a messy compromise and governments have the power to do a lot of damage if they get things wrong - even with the best of intentions, so libertarianism invests as much power with the individual as possible.

I suspect for Britain however it's not the right ideology. We like to whinge, give appeals to nebulous authorities and vest unaccountable power behind as many facades as we can find. Then we complain the government isn't sorting things out for us.

---

&gt;A suggested diagnosis of [tinnitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinnitus), a disturbance of the auditory system, is used by some physicians in response to complaints about The Hum. Tinnitus is generated internally by the auditory and nervous systems, with no external stimulus. However, the theory that the Hum is actually tinnitus fails to explain why the Hum can be heard only at certain geographical locations, to the degree those reports are accurate. There may exist individual differences as to the threshold of perception of acoustic or non-acoustic stimuli, or other normal individual variations that could contribute to the perception of the Hum by some people in the population and not by others.

If the UK debt specifies England as the legal system in which disputes are settled, then the UK government can basically get away with anything (legally speaking), as in English law Acts of Parliament are supreme.

How the market reacts is hard to predict. It is possible that the market would still consider rUK responsible for the debt. I think it more likely that it will follow the nominal legal owner, however, which, if specified so by an Act of Parliament, could be Scotland.

To be clear, I think it unlikely that the UK Parliament would do such a thing. Negotiations would have to completely break down for it to occur. All I'm saying is that it is within the UK's legal power.

Another point is that even with the supposed benefits of privatisation, our infrastructure is still massively underinvested - only difference is that now fare increases don't correlate with better investment... In fact it was only recently pointed out that the reliability of the trains since privatisation is in fact no better than it was a public service.

Owain Glyndŵr's banner was not the same as that of the Princes of Gwynedd. Gwynedd's banner was four lions *passant* (i.e. three paws resting, one paw raised), while Glyndŵr's was four lions *rampant* (two paws raised, standing on their hind legs). The reason for this difference was ancestry - Glyndwr was descended from the royal houses of Powys (whose sigil was a red lion *rampant* on a yellow field) and Deheubarth (whose sigil was a yellow lion *rampant* on a red field). His banner quartered these two sigils to signify the coming together of those two bloodlines in his veins, reinforcing his claim to the title Prince of Wales. The similarity to the banner of the Princes of Gwynedd was nothing more than a fortuitous accident, though I'm sure Glyndŵr himself wasn't displeased by the resemblance.

Edit: Actually as to the debt, there would be no change, the UK has already guaranteed all the debt, which earns the UK brownie points in the eyes of the world.

Edit2: your points in order -

A weakening of the pound is inevitable no matter the circumstances of Scotland's independence, it would actually help the UK's exporters though.

For debt see edit 1.

Peak oil production from the North Sea was in 1999, every barrel extracted today becomes less and less profitable due to increasing production and maintenance costs.

I would love to see your source for UK exports versus Scottish exports. The UK has a 2.1 trillion economy Scotland's would be at most 300 billion.

So would Scotland have a hostile, much larger, much better armed, with more alliances, neighbour on theirs.

The UK could buy more energy from the continent, who will you export yours to and how?

We could probably base Trident subs in American ports while we build new facilities, Scotland loses those jobs immediately.

EU exit is in no way guaranteed as the EU membership has above 40% support without anyone even trying to tell people the benefits we get from membership.

Yes we could wreck it each other, but who do you think would come out better? It would be better for everyone if politicians stopped making scaremongering deniable leaks.

true,comment_redacted,null,null,"1. I thought that was a bit odd too, but it could be for similar reasons as why they don't freak out in modern London every time an alien ship shows up... It's been happening regularly since 2005. In earlier seasons people seemed a lot more freaked out. Maybe it's old had now, and maybe there was a similar wave of oddities in Victorian London (The Doctor does seem to end up there a lot). 

2. Not sure. 

3. The nice thing about Docto Who is that in some ways the show resets every time we get a new Doctor, so there isn't a better time to start watching. They also do a really good job of restarting storylines with a new Doctor to make the show more accessible to new viewers. So I'd say watching earlier seasons isn't a necessity, but if you've got time there's some good stuff there to watch. 

4. Totally disagree, they are nearly totally irrelevant to the main show. 

5. Yeah I didn't quite get that either and felt like that was kind of weak. British TV.. It happens. 

6. In modern London they do because in the early 21st Century the planet has been invaded half a dozen times by aliens. They don't all know about time travel though, and it seems like only select few know of The Doctor himself. 

Some other things to know:  the TARDIS has a ""perception filter"" on it. Unless people are looking right at it, they may not ""notice it.""  There's some kind of psychic link between the TARDIS and it's occupants that allows for instantaneous understanding/translation of foreign languages. We also learned last season that it has the power to project into other people's minds imagery, such as ""holographic clothing"" that others see that The Doctor is not actually wearing.

true,Blue1878,flair,💋,"What the previous two posters has said covers a lot of stuff and it's great advice! Here's a few bits I'd add from my experience 

Be aware of all the facilities the Uni offers you. As another poster pointed out, you can get cv/careers advice and that department can also help you find the volunteer work recommended as well! There will also be student well being facilities available as well, these guys can help you with any issues you might have mentally adjusting to a completely new environment with new challenges etc. if you feel like you need them, they're always there to listen. 

Another thing regarding Uni facilities is be aware of the bonuses it offers! Mine offers free gym membership at a handful of local gyms, free entry to museums and art galleries with my Uni ID, and best of all I discovered the £50 credit the put on my account every year for the library also covers things like memory sticks etc that can be bought in the library. 

Another thing I'd mention is you're possibly in a new city, enjoy exploring but please bear in mind that this is a new exciting place for you but there are obviously many locals who've lived there for years, and things that may be acceptable in city A aren't necessarily acceptable in city B. Be aware of your surroundings, and be safe! 

Nights out... Keep your eyes on the student union bar, cheap drinks and they'll have flyers advertising the local clubs that have student nights. In my city no one cares about students at weekends because they know the clubs will be packed anyway, but the midweek nights are usually heavily discounted to get students in as the 9-5 crowd are less likely to go out mid week. If you and your friends don't have lectures on a Thursday, look for decent Wednesday night offers! 

Student discounts: I mentioned this in our /r/makeupaddictionuk thread, but I didn't go into a lot of detail, seriously, get the NUS extra card, tonnes of discounts in shops, restaurants, even stuff like glasses and broadband can get discounts! Amazon gives a discount, and will also give you 6 months prime free if you link your .ac.uk email address to it (you use your existing account but they send the confirmation to the ac email address as proof) 

When you get your student loan, prioritise what needs to be paid and pay it. It's tempting to have an asos binge I know, but you'll regret it when you haven't paid your rent and the bills are piling up. If possible, also look for a weekend job, if you're in a big city keep your eye out on indeed.co.uk they always seem to have lots of part time jobs, it's handy to have a weekly income plus it'll help you make new friends in your new city!

A lot of No voters seem to think that, if they get their desired result, we're destined for devo max. Frankly, I think that's a pipe dream, but if it did happen then we'd start to see the exact 'unravelling' of our economies that seems to have Ms Craig so terrified.

&gt;Yesterday the Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Krugman devoted his New York Times column to Scottish independence.

Folk who keep appealing to the authority of 'Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman' seem to conveniently forget that the SNP employed the aid of two Nobel Prize-winning economists when putting together their economic proposals. Neither of them share Krugman's views.

&gt;As George Orwell points out, nationalists typically believe their country will be stronger because of the superiority or their people. 

That's just wrong. Nobody can honestly say that the Yes campaign has been run on the back of ethnic superiority.

&gt;Some of the big hitters of the SNP's independence campaign are among Scotland's most ruthless, money-oriented business people

And George Galloway's been campaigning for a No vote, but I don't think anyone assumes that the UK's going to become a haven for the far left if he gets it. Of course big business will still exist in an independent Scotland. The only people who've been bandying about the idea of iScotland being a ""socialist utopia"" are people on the No side attacking a straw man.

&gt;If there is a No vote, there's still hope that all that energy can be used to help create the better world that many of us – Yes and No voters – long for. 

But of course there's no hope of that with a Yes vote.

&gt;There seems to be a political consensus that the sexual abuse of more than 1,400 girls in Rotherham, revealed in the recent Jay report, was caused by ‘political correctness’. And there is no doubt that race played a role in the horrors perpetrated in the town. **Plain-speaking Muslim commentators like Yasmin Alibhai-Brown have set out the issues.** She said in the Independent:

&gt;""I partly blame the families and communities. Too many Asian mothers spoil their boys, undervalue their girls and demean their daughters-in-law. Within some British Asian circles, the West is considered degenerate and immoral. So it is OK to take their girls and ruin them further. Some of the fiercest rows I have ever had have been with Asian women who hold these disgusting views.""

I think its the third paragraph that's actually upsetting you.

&gt;For warriors against PC it’s very satisfying to read such views. But there is a danger that, in stressing political correctness as the root cause, commentators are missing out some more fundamental reasons that industrial scale sex abuse could go on in Rotherham.

Say 4 Brothers go in for a business loan, they want to help their company, ""Union Records"" grow and prosper. It all goes well for a while, but eventually Edgar Land, one of the 4 decides to start throwing his weight around. Choices that were supposed to be made democratically started to consistently favour Edgar over his brothers. Edgar takes on a greater and greater portion of responsibility and focuses the spending of the loan on areas that he is most interested in. 

Scott decides, after a while of this, that rather than hoping Edgar will listen to him (Via a system designed, implemented and moderated by Edgar) he would strike off on his own. Scott found his votes seemed to have no effect on the decisions that were being made, and money was being taken from his share of the company and being spent on things that were not benefiting him. 

Scott decides to leave ""Union Records"" and form ""Indie Studio"" instead, he tells his brothers and while Walt and Irwin might not like it they accept that it's his choice. (Irwin in the past had his ex-wife set up a competing company and there is bad blood to this day, but that is a story for another time). Edgar however is reluctant to let him go, he makes a lot of big promises and tells Scoot things can change, but when Scott asks what will change Edgar just shrugs and says ""trust me"". 

Scott is adamant that he should be able to get out of a company that he fells he isn't getting any benefit out of, and if he wants to start a new job in a new company that should be his choice. Edgar decides to meet him halfway and decides that they should roll a dice, odds Scott has to stay, evens Scott can go, but he needs to take a chunk of the loan with him. 

Scott, naturally, protests. Why should he have to pay back a debt for a company he is leaving? Edgar says, ""Because you helped spend it *^(on my pre approved projects)* so you have to pay it back."" Scott thinks on this for a while and decides, ""OK, but only if I can share Sterling, that big band of ours, and get the benefits of having them on my new label.""

Edgar simply replies, ""No chance. Sterling is ours, and by ours I mean not yours, if you leave me... I mean us, then you leave Sterling. But you will still need to pay the bills incurred by them.""

Scott replies, ""That's madness, if I can't share Sterling then I'm sure as hell not paying their bills.""

""Then why don't you just go back to your office and let me worry about all that then, I will not negotiate on your terms but you *MUST* accept mine."" Edgar replies, trying to look like he's thinking about what's best for everyone but coming off as a selfish and condescending prick. 

""well how about we meet in the middle, I can't pay for something I'm not getting to use, but if I could use Sterling, which you'd still get a majority of control over, then I could consider taking some debt from them."" Scott says, but Edgar is already calling his lawyers, ""**NO**! I've already promised you nothing and I will not negotiate. Why are you being so unreasonable? You've not even rolled the dice yet so why should I have to worry about what could change? I'll just assume you'll bottle it and come crawling back. Nothing to worry about, just keep doing as I say and everything will be fine! Your decisions don't matter and they don't change anything now piss off, I've got to decide how i'm spending the income from that Black Gold band you found. ""

**TL;DR;** I'm bored and analogies are bullshit. Scotland can refuse to pay the debt of an organisation it is no longer associated with, especially one that doesn't listen to Scottish opinions on where to spend that money. Business default all the time, and partners leave companies all the time. While it might make it a little harder to borrow or make interest rates a little higher it won't stop banks form lending, because that's how they make their money. And if they get an excuse to add a few percent onto repayments they'd be jumping at the chance to lend to an Indie Scotland because they'd make more back out of it. By refusing to talk about the implications of a No vote they are just pushing people to vote Yes. Hell, Devolution only came up this week and the party leaders only seem to have noticed this is happening this week. The same week that Yes shows a 2% lead in a single poll.

---

A lot of Yes voters seem to think that they are somehow currently ""ruled"" from Westminster. Scotland elects MPs to Westminster (as well as Holyrood) just like anywhere else in the UK. They actually have far more independence and democratic representation than any other region/nation in the UK.

Scotland currently has separate laws, separately managed police, NHS, Education system, football team so on and so on. Scottish people are over represented proportionally both in the number of politicians at Westminster and also the fact that they can vote on English issues, but not the other way around. So I think its actually the hardcore Yes voters who are misguided about the current situation.

The trend has only been one way, more powers to Holyrood, no powers have been taken back since devolution. 

The Yes voters claim there will be no problems, everything will be better and any possible issues and negatives (of course there will be negatives!) are just scaremongering and point to the fact that Scottish people are clever and resourceful. The No campaign is far more honest, just not as exciting and hasn't resorted to basically just lying and countering everything with ""bullying"" as the SNP have.

true,fixmyfaceyface,null,null,"Just as an addendum, I have few extra comments to add.

Firstly, be kind to yourselves. Yes, you should go to every class and engage with all the material. But, if you are unwell (and it wasn't self inflicted) then you should be kind to yourself and not go to classes that day. 

And secondly, your academics are busy people, but in every department there will be plenty of academics who care about their students and are willing to help. If you need help, ask for it. Don't feel ashamed that you don't immediately understand something. 

Also, try to foster a relationship with your personal tutor/supervisor where you feel comfortable in asking them for help or advice. At some point, you will need their help with something and you want to be comfortable asking for that help. Plus, you'll probably want them to write you a reference some time, and if they know you a bit that reference will be more effective :-)

Make friends with people on your course, and I mean more than just seeing them in classes. Go for coffee, get lunch together, drink together in the evenings. You will need their support at some point during your studies. You will need their help with understanding something, and moaning about how hard an assignment is. Your flatmates/roommates/friends on other courses will find it hard to empathise with your course requirements and the stress points you will experience. Having friends that are doing the same work as you at the same time will make it easier.

Oh... And academic misconduct is a serious business. It's easy to plagiarise without meaning to. It's easy to collude without meaning to. But, it doesn't matter if you indented to plagiarise or not. Academics are really good at spotting misconduct (seriously, it's easy to find!). So learn the rules, and learn how to reference/cite properly and learn it early. You don't need the additional stress of an official warning (or worse).

Finally, have fun! Uni is about more than studying... But, don't forget you are primarily there to get a good degree.

No need to get passive-aggressive. It wasn't a clearly made point.

I quite specifically didn't argue against any of that. I don't think Scotland is under-represented at Westminster in terms of MPs, nor do I think we're under colonial rule.

Come on. That's not how it works. Banks don't advertise what they are willing to pay on a political issue on something that's not even likely to happen.

&gt;There is no default. This word does not mean what you think it means. A default leaves debt unpaid. It ruins credit ratings, you risk bank runs. No one, neither Salmond nor Cameron nor Scotland nor the rUK would want a default. It would be bad for all involved.

I work in finance. Like, this is actually my day to day job. Of course it would be bad for all involved. There also wouldn't be a run on the banks. Why would there? It's a sovereign default not a corporate one. You're betraying a lot of your lack of financial knowledge.

There is no precedent because this exact situation has never happened before. Do you realise that markets aren't mechanical? These things aren't priced by machines. They are priced by people exactly like me. And if Scotland has defaulted on it's debt to the UK then of course I'm going to factor that in if I'm going to loan to them.

&gt; What happens if we put away again the swords and spears, and think in terms of England as heptarchy? Divide 50 million by seven, and you would get a neat set of seven countries, each at seven million souls. Wessex gets the West country and Bristol and the Thames Valley and the South Coast. Cornwall has just been recognised as a distinct region, and this way the whole South West gets to control its own destiny.


&gt; Mercia would be the Midlands and up as far as Manchester, home of manufacturing, with heavy metal and indie music as important exports. Northumbria has the rest of the North. East Anglia could take over Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire as well as Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex. That leaves Kent and Sussex to fight over the South East, with London as a new statelet on its own. I haven't done the maths yet, but I imagine you could do something neat to balance it all out. So then you would have Scotland, Wales and seven English territories on the island of Britain, all of approximately the same scale, and all with a chance of building a sense of identity for themselves. It's no coincidence, that these statelets would be about the same size as the average American state or a Nordic country.

Scotland, Wales, Wessex, Cornwall, Mercia, Northumbria, East Anglia, Kent, Sussex, London.

[I'm not 100% but it sounds like he wants Cornwall to be part of Essex, which is why he lists 7 english states, and I've listed 8]

I could live with that. I think it'd be a great way to return a bit more balance to things.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Ok, leaving out the practical obstacles of actually having a Euro with 53 teams (of which I'm pretty certain there would be many), let's say UEFA do away with qualifiers.  What would be some consequences?  Off the top of my head:

* Every PL player from other federations would still go on international breaks to play qualifiers for their national teams.  This would have a huge impact on pretty much all European leagues, and would hurt teams in an unequal fashion by effectively punishing those who buy foreign players from South America and Africa instead of from Europe.

* Teams from outside Europe will have more time together, enabling them to build a more coherent team, drilled in a certain style of playing, which would give them a significant advantage over European national teams in the World Cup.  Imagine if Spurs and four other PL teams never had any preseason matches, and had to spend the first month or two of the PL getting the team to play as a team.  Hardly a fair deal, would you say?

* No home games for European national teams for two years, which means no opportunity for the public to see their players in action, get to know them, develop a relationship to them as the national team.

I'm sure there are several that I can't think of as well.

Let me also just say that I do not love these breaks either; every week that goes by without a Spurs game is just that much more grey and dull.  I do have to admit that this is probably in part because my country's national team is rather terrible, sleep-inducingly boring to watch, and hardly ever qualifies for either Euro or WC, so there's not a single reason to watch them except for ""national pride"", of which I have little.

It would not be cheaper for you just to start off at junk.

This is a common misconception amongst laymen. People equate sovereign debt to personal debt. It's not how it works. Countries effectively never pay off their debt they just re-finance or if you want a term that you'll understand they 're-mortgage'. It makes zero economic sense to ever fully pay off your debt.

When a government has debt coming due they just re-issue more debt and pay it back. If interest rates are low they do it a lot. Look at Spain they just issued 50y paper at 4%. Their liabilities are essentially 4% every year and when it comes due they will just issue more debt.

Probably the most important of these post is that of High Representative (""Foreign Secretary""), but the last HR was a British person, so we probably wouldn't get the post again. Although I think in those circles Catherine Ashton was seen as successful in the job.

true,canard_glasgow,null,null,"&gt; This is assuming that markets also agree that there is no connection between rUKs historic debt and iScotlands future debt, when I think there is quite an obvious connection and this will influence the markets attitude to lending money, at least initially (5-10 years) when iScotland's borrowing will most likely be at its peak.

I'm not contesting that. As I said, an iScotland would not be treated as a completely new country as many factors as already known. This has both good and bad points, but it does promote stability.  

&gt;In spite of what you say I believe there is a risk the markets could react badly, I couldn't put a % on it but to pretend its zero seems to miss a lot of the complexity in this situation.

I never said zero, it seems very likely that that Scotland will have a weaker credit rating than the rUK.

They don't seem to work on an international level.

&gt;Who is demanding? Me? I'm in no position to demand an entire nation do anything. I can say what I think, though.

In which you're pretty much demanding that other countries follow our example, now that we've finally made it. And I hope they do...but a lot of the time they don't.

&gt;Wrong.

So the status quo now has to build a case before you'll acknowledge it? Good luck with that.

&gt;You've pointed out a lot more, but not substantiated it.

Which you don't list, so I won't address them. Unless you want me to substantiate the Irish taking no notice of how out-of-date their abortion laws are.

&gt;You mean self serving

No, I don't. Not insulting another country simply because they don't follow *your* laws and morals isn't self-serving.

&gt;I don't have to be diplomatic though - not here on Reddit.

Well, you do if you want any comments to be taken at all seriously. And you obviously do, or you wouldn't be asking people to 'build a case'.

&gt;We as a country could be part of a push towards better living conditions across the world, if only we'd care to be slightly less 'diplomatic'.

I think (or like to think) that we already are. We don't have a good track record of trying the less diplomatic approach when we want something to happen or change.

&gt;The people posting the comments in the original article aren't diplomatic either - fairs fair.

I never read the comments from original articles, that's one reason I come here instead...and in any case, I'd never see comments on original articles and reddit comments as the same in the first place. You *won't* normally get a particle physicist or microbiologist debunking a relevant article for everyone on mumsnet.

&gt;That's a start - but we as a nation could take a leading role in not just being a huge defence supplier around the world (which we are) but also doing some good as well. We do try and be a big fish - it'd be great if we could get over ourselves and be a bit more frank about moving some nations on from their archaic beliefs.

Ultimately, I agree - but education (which ultimately, is our only tool) doesn't always triumph - and we're far from the first ones to work this out. We even have a terrorist organisation to deal with calling itself 'Western Education is Sinful'. Not sure how we get around that.

&gt;So we lobby others and don't do it alone. I agree that expecting a change in a week is unlikely - but we shouldn't mince our words either. My stance is one of 'look, we think how you do X is daft, outdated and harmful' - absolute honesty, not a demand or ransom or sanction but a simple comment.

But in cases like Japan, we've been lobbying them to stop killing whales for, what, thirty years? Or what about the Chinese, who have even *more* dodgy practices going on. I hold out hope that if *enough* countries bring in gay marriage law, the rest will follow...but we still have countries that want/ have the death penalty *just for being gay*, never mind marriage; we have to deal with those first as a priority - those countries are still rolling along, ignoring the rest of the world (and, I'd like to think, their own conscious) - if we're failing at getting *those* problems reversed, it highlights how, ultimately, gay marriage is a bit further down the list of priorities.

&gt;At least we'll garner some respect for taking a stance on something meaningful. As it is we seem to slime our way around everyone elses cultures - terrified of offending anyone.

We're already doing that by bringing in such new laws and sticking to them - and I like to think we're getting respect for that (even if it is in private). I agree that we do give too much preference to other cultures, but that's a society problem, not government - and I'm not sure how we can get away from the PC-brigade that now infect everything, IRL and online.

You realise that the rate a central bank sets is the rate at which *they* lend money at? The rate at which a sovereign borrows at is set by the market.

In the case of Australia the cash rate is 2.5%. So that is the lowest at which they can issue debt otherwise one could borrow off the central bank and buy the sovereign debt with no risk.

Japan's equivalent cash rate is 0%. They are also engaging in the worlds biggest QE (relative to size) which forces down interest rates.

Pretty much.

But we could go on indefinitely with all the wrongs in the world - right now I'm looking at *this* one - let's not get distracted? 

&gt; No, I don't. Not insulting another country simply because they don't follow your laws and morals isn't self-serving.

True, but insulting them because they cause suffering to their people and advocate electric shock therapy to 'treat' homosexuality seems quite approropriate. We insult people for a lot less. I'm not saying ""The Chinese"" are backwards - but that is a backwards belief. 

&gt; Well, you do if you want any comments to be taken at all seriously. 

I really don't though. We're part of a website where people post pictures of their cats and of dead women's bodies for 'votes'. You can take me seriously or not at my word - I don't need to be diplomatic about anything. You're not going to invade me or sanction me. The Chinese aren't going to change their ways simply because I wrote a more diplomatic post on /r/unitedkingdom. 

(The bits in the middle here I do agree with) 

&gt; But in cases like Japan, we've been lobbying them to stop killing whales for, what, thirty years? Or what about the Chinese, who have even more dodgy practices going on. I hold out hope that if enough countries bring in gay marriage law, the rest will follow...

The interesting thing here (I hope) is that there will be homosexuals in China who will also be in favour of this - there's a human interest. The whales don't have such a voice (though I agree that's another bad practice). 

&gt; but we still have countries that want/ have the death penalty just for being gay, never mind marriage; we have to deal with those first as a priority

Yup, that does make sense - though I guess it depends how we 'deal' with them - if we're just making public statements then I don't see why a blanket statement can't encompass those who frown on homosexuality AND those who kill for it. 

Ultimately I don't think we're completely at odds here - we both want the same thing, I'm just a bit less flexible in how we go about it.

I live in rural England too. I don't know if this is the case, but I think the average Scot would be better represented politically with independence. E.g. look at the[ last general election map](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/2432632/UK-General-Election-2010-political-map.html). In Scotland Lib Dems got a clear lead, followed by Labour with virtually no Conservative support. If they were an independent country, they would have totally different leadership to what they've ended up with.

I suppose some people value democratic and representative leadership more than they value economic perks. I'm sure some would argue ""what's the point in having more money if it's not spent on the people and ideas we voted for?""

I'm sure there's more to it than just this though.

Except as you say, central banks set the risk-free rate for short term debt. When sovereigns borrow on short term then, they simply get that rate with little variation.

After all, if you can borrow pounds at X% you're going to be willing to loan them to the government for a fortnight for X+Y% where Y is the tiniest of markups (that darn competition between everyone else wanting risk-free interest). The market only determines the rate so far as setting Y, but considering Y's always going to be low to negative who cares?

&gt; Why would Argentina or any of the other countries have defaulted if they could just set their own interest rate to zero and issue debt?

You're aware that Argentina doesn't have a free-floating currency right? That they [borrow USD](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304026304579449283459471874), and that's what their debt is denominated in? Because if so you'd realise they don't control that rate.

Their situation's just not relevant to the UK borrowing GBP or Scotland borrowing a newly created Scottish pound, the hypothetical we're discussing. Countries that are relevant are the UK today, US, Canada, Australia, Japan... but none of these monetary sovereigns have any problems servicing their debt today. Sure, some of them have a lot of it, the leaders of each of them say they have a debt problem, but the market hasn't stopped loaning any of them their respective currencies for the risk-free rate.

No, the pound is as strong as it is today as a result of the past. Currency is *all* about the past.

Scotland either gets it currency union and pays its share of debt, or it doesn't get its currency union and the UK then takes on that debt. If the UK is taking Scotland's ""shares"" so to speak, they must also take Scotland's debts.

Taxes pay for infrastructure, Scotland has paid its taxes. Trying to hold Scotland accountable for the national debt over a few buildings and vehicles while Westminster pisses the money away on arms deals and whatever else they are doing to try and stay relevant won't work here.

Scotland did not create that debt, Westminster did. Scotland will pay a share of that debt if it gets a currency union, with the currency it has helped build over 300 years. If it does not get that currency union, then it is being refused rights what it has helped build up, therefore it absolves Scotland of any liability for that which they have no right to.

To be able to fix the exchange rate, the Scottish bank would need to have enough GBP to buy a large portion of the Scottish currency (people below speculate that they might need to keep 100% reserve which could be the case). But the value of the GBP they keep in their vault would also be moving. That means they may be forced at times to purchase larger quantities of GBP in the case that the price falls low enough so they do not have sufficient reserves. This seems like it might be a mechanism by which the Scottish bank would actually be propping up the value of the GBP (which I am sure no Scottish person wants).

There is a long, and slightly no biased article on the economic aspects of Scottish independence that is definitely worth a read (regardless of your stance). It is a bit sensationalist, but the fundamental arguments seem quite sound.

true,chilari,eng-shropshire,Shropshire,"&gt; Scotland either gets it currency union and pays its share of debt, or it doesn't get its currency union and the UK then takes on that debt.

No, other way round. Scotland either accepts its debt and gets its share of UK assets on the ground, or it doesn't and the UK holds onto various pieces of land all over Scotland and cuts off Scotland from various other UK national assets. The currency union is something Salmond is demanding aside from all that. He's demanding it in spite of the problems it will cause and in spite of it being beyond the relevant assets linked to the debt.

The currency union thing is about the future. Where it is now, if the pound is tied to a foreign economy that the UK has no control over, Scotland could fuck it up, like Greece with the Euro, except bigger, because the pound isn't used in as many countries as the Euro so doesn't have the bulk to balance things out. If Scotland's economy tanks, Scotland fucks up itself *and* the rUK. That's why we don't want you having a currency union, because if you fuck up, we're fucked too in spite of you lot deciding to fuck right off.

an asset is something i can sell for money to someone, these include things like.

hospitals, police stations, Schools, government buildings, bridges, snow plows, police cars, ambulances, medical equipment etc. 

Currently all this assets in scotland were payed for and are owned by the UK goverment (which used the national debt to pay for them)

The powers of the bank of england arn't assets because they can't be sold for cash they are something a a government can do like been able to make laws or declare war it doesn't have a cash value.

The irony of trying to pretend powers of government are assets, is that most people in the yes campaign are ignoring the real assets Scotland needs to get from the UK (schools roads hospitals).

So if Scotland decides it doesn't want any assets or debts fine it can buy/rent everything on mass from rUK, of course it will need to borrow the money to do it, and that money will be lent at a worse rate then it was to the BoE, also due to inflation, quantitative easing and a bunch of other factors it would likely cost more than Scotlands share of the debt to do it that way.

So the debt is a pretty poor negotiation tool for Scotland better to get the assets even without a currency union than to get nothing at all which would be pretty catastrophic for Scotland, and perhaps a mild inconvenience for rUK which now has to sell a bunch of buildings and equipment to make its money back.",0,1410356299,null,0,1410356982,0,ckecmu8,t3_2fw0ae,t1_ckecmu8,t1_cke0q09,null,1427093530,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's important to remember that the debt will legally belong to rUK after independence, as the UK Government has accepted - so the Scottish Goverment could refuse to take on a share of the debt if rUK refused to offer a fair share of assets such as the Bank of England.  That's not in anyone's interests, and is therefore another reason why we can be confident Scotland and rUK will negotiate a sensible agreement to our mutual benefit after a Yes vote.

One person administers the bank account that is for bills and rent but all your names are on that bank account. Using that bank account, which you all pay into, you buy a number of appliances for the kitchen. A dishwasher, a blender, a microwave, a toaster and a kettle. Now, one housemate, let's call him Bob, decides he no longer likes his housemates. He wants to move out to a studio flat on his own. And he wants to take the microwave and the kettle with him, which amount to 1/4 of the purchase price of all five appliances, since he paid a quarter of the price to buy all the appliances. But the whole house is behind on rent, because all housemates paid in £50 less last month than they should have. The other housemates say ""pay the £50 you're behind on, and you can have the microwave and kettle"". But Bob doesn't want to pay the £50 he's behind on, and he does want to take the mircowave and kettle. That's what the debt and assets are like. Bob wants his share of the assets without paying his share of the debt.

&gt;That's complete nonsense. Scotland can use the pound, as Salmond is so keen to point out, what you are arguing for is more than that. You are arguing for a foreign country to tie themselves into a currency union with us

No shit Sherlock, welcome to the debate, we've all been waiting for you.

&gt;Something that we aren't owed in the slightest. The currency union you speak of isn't a ""shared asset"" or anything like that, it's a hypothetical idea that doesn't even exist yet. The UK wouldn't owe us it morally any more than Ireland or France would.

The currency union is shares in the bank of England and access to the treasury. Both of which we have paid into and helped build into what they are today. We are being refused this, so we are therefore not liable for them. Therefore, we are not liable for the debt. If the UK doesn't ""owe"" us anything for our contribution, then we do not ""owe"" the UK anything for the UK's debt.

&gt;Stop talking shite. ""Yes"" voters in /r/Scotland all pat themselves on the back for being the clued up generation, the internet generation that researches everything thoroughly and gets to the truth of the matter but as you've demonstrated this is far from the truth. You're just saying crap without even thinking about it.

true,AwwComeOnNow,capaldi,Capaldi,"1. I'd say this was a tad unusual. Some avid fans even complained that it was a weird reaction after the episode. When something is attacking the Earth in the show, there is generally a lot more panic.
2. In this particular episode, I think the police know that there is kind of a vigilante crime fighting gang, but they dont seem to particularly work with each other. Though this changes depending on what setting that particular episode takes place in  .
3. Season 8 is supposed to take the show in a new direction. There is some stuff that may be spoiled about past seasons by the current season. It would be best to go watch the first ones before S08, but not vital. I would start at the 2005 reboot, though.
4. You dont NEED to watch any. After the first couple season of DW, youll learn more about torchwood, and it become a good lead-in to that show. TorchWood is a really good show based in the same universe, but made for an older audience. I've never seen any SJA episodes though.
5. Pretty shoddy plot device used in that episode, nearly no one agreed with it. Not super typical, but yea, youll have to suspend disbelief every once in a while in the show.

The United Kingdom will be infinitely worse off, both economically and culturally, without Scotland. The English, and the Welsh have historical ties with Scotland that they do not have with Northern Ireland. We exist as an historical anomaly, but exist we do and that's a matter for another thread.

Constituationally nothing changes for Northern Ireland, but I think you would see calls for further devolution to Wales and NI, if not English regional devolution. I'm not convinced this is a good thing for us, given Stormont's track record.

It is likely to increase tensions, especially at flashpoints in Belfast.

On the plus side it will cement the call for NI to be given special treatment, especially with regards to corporation tax. We will be a part of the UK effectively surrounded by countries with more attractive tax regimes for businesses.

One benefit that is 'outside' for us is that I think it would shake up the political system quite a bit. Although UKIP have some 'undesirable' followers, they seem to offer the best chance of some sort of political change at least.

Personally though I think we have bigger problems than worrying about what Scotland does. We need to get our own devolution working properly and a lot more jobs like the ones announced recently. We need to entice more people to invest here, both in highly skilled technical/service jobs and low skilled industrial work. The only real resource we have is people.

The interests of South East England and Conservative MPs won't be merely diminished, they would be cemented as absolutely central in a newly created nationalist English state.

The only reason Conservatives and Liberals are upset about the prospect of the United Kingdom ending is against their self interest and the interests of the 'establishment'. They are literally putting the emotional, cultural and political bonds that unite us as a greater nation above other ideological interests.

&gt; Those assets were paid for using the debt the UK government has built up over the years.
&gt; If Scotland wants ownership of those assets, it would be expected to take on the debt that was created in order to build them.
&gt; If it doesn't want to do that the UK government can simply refuse to sign over ownership.

And what would they do exactly to stop us from using them? I don't think a piece of paper in London saying ""Property of H.M. government"" really means anything to people living in Scotland. Especially considering it will be a foreign government if there is a yes vote.

&gt;There is only one sensible option here Scotland needs to take on the debt and own its infrastructure not to do so would be a disaster for Scotland, and a inconvenience for rUK.

Scotland paid tax for that infrastructure, don't act like it was given on goodwill. The sensible thing is to refuse a currency union and refuse any debt. To do otherwise is to sign yourself into perpetual debt to the UK, and we're just not going to do that.

&gt;Refusing to take the debt is not a valid negotiating tactic for Scotland, because Scotland would be hurt far more by it than rUK.

No, it wouldn't. Scotland has no liability for a foreign country's debt, to say it is is scaremongering. Bringing up ""world banks"" and ""investors"" would be pure speculation on your part, so it's not an argument.

Only the UK is liable for UK debt.

I find it difficult to disagree with your point of view as I too am against being governed from afar (Brussels), and that shares similarities with your complaint of being governed from Westminster. Scotland is undoubtedly more left leaning than England.

The carnage of a Yes vote will be interesting on a political level, and I do genuinely fear for Scotlands future should you leave, but please do not take that as a personal attack on your abilities to govern yourself! 

I worry that Scotland will struggle economically, which will hamper any increase in social spending (Scotland already receives more per person than the UK average), and politically Scotland will be much weaker internationally out of the UK. But mostly, I fear that independence will be a great disappointment for the Scots, a mistake that would be pretty much impossible to undo.

For such a small group of islands, the UK has done miraculously well on all possible measures of achievement, global leaders in many areas. Breaking us into a divided group of small islands, can only be a bad thing in my mind.

true,Torquemada1970,english,Slurrey,"&gt;We've been talking of nothing specific so it's impossible to say that.

I've been talking about a number of other, arguably more important issues like basic rights for women - if there was a sure-fire way of educating (or applying some other approach to) these countries into not being quite so barbaric, it would be in place already. To my mind, religion wrapped up in cultural identity is a primary obstacle to progress. Again and again. It's depressing!

&gt;I can only say what I believe is right.

Oh indeed, and I'd agree - but we have to knuckle down and come up a better solution than 'I don't like X', yes?

&gt;Pretty much. (to the status quo having to build a case)

You might feel like that, but asking the world to justify itself to you in order to shape your opinions rarely works out well.

&gt;right now I'm looking at this one - let's not get distracted?

I wasn't listing the other examples as whataboutisms - more 'these issues are in a similar vein, and are more important, but we haven't found a way to resolve them yet', to illustrate why it's not as easy as it should be. I understand where you're coming from - given the choice, I'd ignore a large number of countries in the world simply because they still assume they can use ignorance as a shield...but that won't help anyone.

&gt;I'm not saying ""The Chinese"" are backwards - but that is a backwards belief.

It is indeed, and worse than that they have hundreds more beliefs like that. And while we can't dictate their own law for them, we can at least vote with our feet - which is why I get annoyed at how much we ignore globally if there's $ involved, from Google to Cameron. We didn't spend a thousand years fighting for social justice and equality in order for it all to be dismissed because China can build it for Apple cheaper using child slaves...and yet here we are.

&gt;I really don't though. We're part of a website where people post pictures of their cats and of dead women's bodies for 'votes'.

Not in this thread - you're oversimplifying by quite a lot.

&gt;You can take me seriously or not at my word - I don't need to be diplomatic about anything.

Correct, but you'll get the level of conversation that goes with that. If you just wanted cats and dead women, you'd be in another sub right now, yes?

&gt;You're not going to invade me or sanction me.

No, you get *dismissed* by those who see your posts regularly. Which is annoying if you then want a serious discussion, because you'll have been flagged and it's too late (I suppose you could make another account, but then you could get addressed as 'o redditor of three days', by someone like me).

&gt;The Chinese aren't going to change their ways simply because I wrote a more diplomatic post on /r/unitedkingdom.

Maybe not, but discussion is, after all, where ideas come from - and people won't be so inclined to do so further if you've assumed that being polite is optional earlier on, which is potentially dangerous as you could plant a seed with someone else, who enhances the idea, etc. - I don't like the idea of that not happening.

&gt;The interesting thing here (I hope) is that there will be homosexuals in China who will also be in favour of this - there's a human interest.

Oh indeed, the existence of homosexuals in these countries is what makes it a tragedy and nothing less. And to many locals, they're not much different from the whales - they're treated as subhuman, and their opinions are not considered. What bothers me is that by doing business with these people, we're legitimising their approach - but then, if that's a Uganda, it doesn't make that much difference; but if it's China or India, there's so much business to be done that if we (the UK) don't, someone else will; and there's a rule about morals being something you can *afford* to live by.

&gt;Yup, that does make sense - though I guess it depends how we 'deal' with them - if we're just making public statements then I don't see why a blanket statement can't encompass those who frown on homosexuality AND those who kill for it.

I would like the UK Gov/ EU/ etc. to go a bit further, maybe bring automatic sanctions to countries that outlaw stuff like being gay under the deliberate ignorance that it's 'a choice'. I've already turned down work at one site that wanted me to go to Uganda because I have a brother who's gay and didn't considering what they'd do to him simply for being who he is.

&gt;Ultimately I don't think we're completely at odds here - we both want the same thing, I'm just a bit less flexible in how we go about it.

Absolutely, we want the same result - and although I'm being the bad guy by pointing out the obstacles, I actually envy your inflexibility!

true,iheke,null,null,"For those needing a bit more detail.

A Local Authority (in this case Haringey) may authorise the compulsory purchase of a property in order to further certain aims (e.g. economic, social, environmental well-being) . The Secretary of State for the Department of Communities and Local Government may then confirm the order after conducting a consultation. The statutory provisions are provided [here](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/8/section/226).

There is only one remaining objector, the Josif Family and Archway Sheet Metal Works Family Ltd (Important note, this is not an invitation for idiot fans to harass them, its their property and they have a right to proper recourse under the law). They think the CPO is defective for a number of reasons - e.g. breach of state aid law, plans in breach of planning framework, no or modest regenerative contribution, poor assessment of alternatives, and poor negotiation (i.e. poor cash offer).

There was an detailed inquiry carried out and a report prepared by the inspector. In the end, the decision by the secretary of state came down to two things -- firstly whether affordable housing needed to be included in the scheme in order to be consistent with the planning framework, and secondly whether notice was properly served and if not whether the lack of proper service was prejudicial. On the first question, the Secretary of state sided with the club/local authority that the regeneration would be substantial even in the absence of affordable housing and that even though the decision appeared not to be consistent with the framework it was in spirit - the scheme was not viable if affordable housing was a requirement. (I'm guessing that this will be the main battleground for the judicial review). Secondly, the notice was defective but no prejudice arose from the defective notice. For those wanting the detailed view, the letter from DCLG is [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/329823/140711Spurs_CPOLE_-_final.pdf)
The actual CPO is available [here.](http://www.haringey.gov.uk/pn-ndp-compulsory-purchase-order-20140728.pdf)
For those planning geeks that are interested in all of the plans see [here.](http://www.haringey.gov.uk/index/housing_and_planning/planning-mainpage/strategicphysicalregeneration/ndp.htm)

So it appears that the decision by the LA/DCLG to grant the CPO will be challenged by Judicial Review. Frighteningly, it looks like it might actually be delicately balanced - if the Local Authority planning framework insists on affordable housing Haringey will have to have good reasons for thinking that a scheme without affordable housing is a good thing. Also, if the court weighs into the tricky points on state aid - all bets could be off. That said, you would expect commonsense to prevail, this is a massive multiple hundreds of millions deal that is already delivering regeneration to the area - this should mean that the club should be working as hard as it can to settle this matter out of court (i.e. give the business much more money than they will receive under a CPO).",0,1410359449,null,0,false,0,ckedzpi,t3_2fzv0n,t1_ckedzpi,t1_ckea496,null,1427092897,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

true,baconfaust,null,null,"The ""they're all the same"" issue is a valid concern though - ideologically, there's no real difference between the big three Westminster parties (they vary a little here and there but on most things they have very similar policies). There's a lot of reasons for this, democratic fatigue, safe seats etc.but it's a very real situation.

There's also a vicious circle that happens where political parties only represent older voters because they vote in large numbers, which means younger people don't bother voting because parties only represent old folks, and on and on it goes. PR is a reasonable solution to this because you can have parties (or my favourite, independents) who don't just represent one group of people having a voice.

I'm 27 and was pretty well engaged politically before the referendum (I've harassed my MP/MSP about all sorts of stuff), but if there is a No vote then I'm pretty much on course to disengage completely with Westminster - my vote is literally useless unless I vote for a big party, and if I vote at all, all I'm doing is legitimising the system. If there was a ""none of the above"" option on the ballot that actually had an impact (e.g. another election where none of the original candidates can stand if it wins) then I'd do it, but as it stands even a spoiled vote is pointless as they're not counted and don't influence anything.",0,1410359646,null,0,false,0,ckee2zj,t3_2fznak,t1_ckee2zj,t1_ckedbbt,null,1427092854,2,false,scottishpolitics,t5_2u66o,2

Housing is not in a crisis.  The housing situation is better than ever before, not perfect admittedly but far better now than for a long time.  House prices are high because the UK is a debt driven economy, it's when they fall that you should worry.

Youth unemployment is worrying and yes British society is unequal, but it always has been.  Stop watching terrestrial TV and reading the damned newspapers, their sole purpose is to show you how insignificant you are and how super duper important everyone else is.  Ignore it and you'll feel much better.

Corporate lobbyists are not really as bad as you're led to believe.  Corporations try to hash out the best deal for themselves but the result is almost always more jobs for Brits within that corporation.  Also, it's legal and all documents, minutes of meetings etc are accessible to the public.

Our education system is not the greatest, but the internet teaches everyone whatever they want to know.

London makes almost all of the money, remember - the UK is a debt driven economy, if you could see the eye watering amounts of money banks and insurance make you'd shut up and shuffle away.  Banking is where the majority of our loot comes from, not oil or manufacturing.  If you're in debt then you support this economy (we are all in debt).  No wonder London takes the lion's share.

NHS privatisation is happening because there is an awful lot of inefficiency within it.  You might not like it but it's cheaper to have private companies run certain aspects of it.  Although, I would prefer a fully nationalized NHS but it's not going to happen.

Quality of life in the UK is weird.  On the one hand we don't have much of a QOL, because we don't speak to our neighbors, there is zero sense of community, there's nothing to do except go to the pub etc.  you need to dig deeper and look at the huge amount of museums, many are free to enter, the public park land all over the place, the public forests where you can ride your bike or go for walks, libraries that still exist, the spending on town/city centres so they look nice, the art exhibitions, music festivals, special interest events etc.  the quality of life in the UK is truthfully the greatest on the planet, but you have to get off your sofa, turn off the tv, put down your newspaper and go outside to see it.

In the event of any Direct Democracy I have no doubt there will be cock-ups galore early on, but once people realise their view matters now, will become a lot more engaged and the cock-ups will become fewer and fewer and people become more responsible, and probably less harsh on the politicians they can't understand at the moment.

my sense is that it would be a concrete repudiation of the toxic way in which, and in who's interest, they have ruled the post-war uk.

it's certainly true that they'd be able to show their true colours during any negotiations, but after the scottish people would be free to make there own way.

while it's by no means the only possible outcome, my hope is that this is a chance to establish a social democracy in britain. if that happens it'll be an embarrassment for the establishment that has long fought against such a possibility, in favour of markets rigged in their favour.

if they had wanted to stop the independence movement, they'd could probably have done so by proactively supporting some of the obvious measures that would redistribute powers. which isn't some hand-waving about decentralisation, but a move towards a more federal model, a written constitution, reform (abolition) of the house of lords, regional assemblies, a modern electoral system, etc. instead they (arrogantly) thought that they'd win, and haven't acted until it's may well be too late.

You forget that freedom to marry who you desire is not even a universal principle, let alone whatever gender. Cultures frequently have different attitudes as to what constitutes appropriate sexual conduct and who one should marry. To suggest that our approach, which we have recently adopted, should be a basic human right is to ignore the fundamental principle of consensus in international human rights. 

A better example than the two you suggest would be a person from another nation conducting what we would judge to be forced marriage, for instance if either party is too young, with a British national in a London embassy. If we were made aware of it we would be unable to prevent it, but it would cause problems with diplomatic relations. Until there is an agreed international consensus on what is and is not acceptable, diplomats who ignore these problems are either ignorant of the complex cultural considerations around sexual conduct or place self interest above the interest of the foreign office.

It's not as simple as that, relocating a business is no small feat, you need to scout sort out new premises in an area where there is an existing worker pool capable of meeting your needs. Many will fail from that alone and those that succeed will take years to equal their previous situation. You need to move any equipment to the new location which is fine for an office, not so much for a machine shop or any other number of industries. 

&gt; Honestly I don't understand why people seem to think there is a snow balls chance in hell of a currency union given every single party imediately said no way,

These parties are proven liars and you should surely know this by now. There are many reasons why a currency union benefits rUK. For one you'll probably never get back up to a triple-AAA credit rating without it, North Sea oil is pretty much responsible for one of those letters as it represents a guaranteed ongoing asset. Creditors like stuff like that. 

&gt;  and it would essentially put rUK on the hook for Scotland debts.

No, it wouldn't, that's bullshit. The phrase ""lender of last resort"" has been thrown about wily-nilly by thousands of people who don't know what it means. 

There is nothing whatsoever that forces rUK to underwrite Scotland's debts, even in a currency union. It's usually in their interests to nudge it in the right direction (due to inter-linked economies) but even a total complete collapse of Scotland's economy would place no debts on rUK's shoulders. It still be bad for rUK but purely because they would lose one of their biggest trading partners. 

The reason why a currency union **will** happen is because we are so closely economically intertwined that not working in each other's best interests will only harm both of us equally. It's not like we are German/Greece with completely different economies, our needs are extremely closely aligned. 

A 5-10 year union will be agreed with a periodic review taking place to consider whether it's still a good idea. It goes beyond common sense and I can't believe that so many are accepting the word of proven liars over what obvious is common sense. 

&gt; Its like telling your parents you want to leave home you don't need there money and can take care of your self, but you want to take one of there no limit credit cards just incase you run out of money.

That's a terrible analogy and it infuriates me that you've been led to believe this be the UK's incredibly deceptive press. That's not what a currency union is!!

Right, so apart from where religion is mentioned (as part of a build up to a paragraph long diatribe of the culture around that religion) religion isn't mentioned.

While I can sympathise with your lack of optimism for politics and the future of the country (I'm not exactly horny for any of the politicians who stand a chance at the moment), that's a completely orthogonal problem to that of independence.  If we have an independent Scotland and continue to have the same situation politically here, there's only so many other parts of the country we can make independent to create more chances for something radical to occur, before we run out of places.

true,woocheese,null,null,"I will try my best to offer you an insight from the policing perspective and how we use force and why we need firearms officers within a reasonable distance of everywhere.

We do not want every police officer carrying a gun, we do not have an armed police force in the UK and I'd quite like it to stay that way. (Taser is a different matter).

While most police work is a mixture of problem solving, investigating crime and enforcing the law some of the job involves being the one to tackle violent behaviour as it's happening. Sometimes somebody will try to hurt someone and the police are the ones tasked with trying to get to them and stop them from doing so.

When this involves people fighting with their bodies all we really need are tasers, sprays and batons or just overwhelming numbers. We are not soldiers, we are not in the dojo learning martial arts everyday becoming perfect fighting machines we don't have the time. So we have tools that even the playing fields we don't want a fair fight because we could lose, we want the odds in out favour we need a back up option that we can fall back on that will stop us from dying should our first option fail! A punch to the head can kill, I'm not being punched in the head by anyone and will do anything necessary to stop them from doing so. Pre-emptive strikes are perfectly fine if justified.

But what happens when there is a person with knife threatening people? Should we send the local bobby with the stab vest and the taser? We can do but what happens if the bloke with the knife runs at him? What if the taser misses? Then are we expecting him to take on a man with a knife intent on killing him with nothing but a long metal stick and a stab vest? They would be at a disadvantage let alone on equal footing. I wouldn't fancy my chances. We've all seen the video of the two males charging the armed officers after they killed Lee Rigby, if they mean business they will do some real damage.

Which is why we need armed police. So that at that knife job we have the option of a baton gun or finally the lethal option of a firearm. So that when we are not able to talk them down and they make the choice to fight us and the tasers and baton rounds fail to hit their target there is that final solution of a bullet to stop that person before they kill someone.

Knife and firearms jobs are rarer than most other jobs but they still happen every couple days and we need a rapid response to those scenes like we do for any other call where lives are in danger. We need to have enough firearms officers all over the force so that we can get them to the scene within a reasonable time.

They still respond to other calls like anyone else would. They carry guns yes but they are police officers and as such they need to do police work.  So you'll see them going to thefts from Tesco's or showing up at your neighbours house after a domestic argument and they will be carrying their pistol but that is not because police are routinely armed it's because numbers are shrinking and firearms officers are being sent to none firearms jobs because they happen to be nearest. 

Why do they still carry guns at those low risk jobs? Because when the call comes in they may well find themselves in the car racing to the scene for 20 minutes driving as fast as possible giving that all their attention, then they could arrive at the scene and find themselves required to fire their weapons within seconds of being there. If there is an active shooter then they may not have the time to open up a safe and take out their weapon, load it then get out of the car.

WHL seats 36,000 and brings in £40.2m/pa.

To me Stadium:MK seems a non-starter with 22,000 capacity you're practically shaving one third off your potential matchday revenue for the year excluding any costs for renting the venue. I would probably exclude the Madjewski (24,000), Craven Cottage (26,000), Selhurst Park (26,000) and Charlton (27,000) for the same reason -- loftus and vicarage road have been excluded as sub 20,000.

Setting rivalries aside, the club would probably rank the most appropriate venues as being Emirates (60,000), Olympic Stadium (52,000) and Stamford Bridge (42,000). However putting the rivalries back in only the Olympic Stadium is even vaguely possible.

I know Twickenham (82,000) and Wembley (90,000) are two stadiums that have been regularly bandied about but the idea of our team knocking about in a quarter filled cavernous stadium which is really expensive to run is really the worse thing we could possibly do.

Thinking outside the box, I would actually like to see the club use the season to drum up some international support watching competitive Premier League games (I'm sure Scudamore would sign up for that) and grow some commercial revenue. Admittedly, it would not be ideal for home fans for that season but if we don't get the olympic stadium - we're facing trips out of London anyway. We've got 18 home games that we'll have to locate - I'd say have 9 in our UK home and then 9 premier league ""internationals"" - e.g. 2 US, 2 Asia, 1 S.America, 4 European. The big problem with the idea is that UK fans would probably lose the big games - I can easily see the game vs Man Utd and Pool being in Asia and City and Chelsea being in the US. You'd want the NLD to remain in UK (Wembley?) but could see that game selling out Stade France (82,000).

When Gerrard was out last season we played Lucas/Allen/Henderson through the middle. We didn't play long so much, play became tighter and we worked the ball on the ground more. But we still could hit on the counter lightning fast and transition play extremely well. Just because it isn't a 40+ yard diagonal cannon of a long ball sailing through the air doesn't mean it is necessarily a worse or even really slower counter. 

The shape and style change drastically when Gerrard is not involved because we can play around a defensive pivot as opposed to more of a deep playmaker, which opens the game up for the 2 midfielders more. It's no coincidence that Henderson picked up a handful of assists in Gerrard's absence last season, and then his rate declined again immediately once Gerrard was fit.

It is watch the European debates on a currency union they have nothing to do with the UK and yet the arguments and problems they are having are exactly the problems the UK government have said prevent a currency union.

Having said that I think both groups (Palestinian and Israeli) certainly feel a far far greater sense of kinship with their own group and a distance towards to the other. And of course there are extremists on both sides. 

I think it we look at [the toll of operations](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-28666562), and if we start from the premise that all human life is equal then it is pretty clear that while both IDF and Hamas both should be condemned, one side is responsible for far more death.

There are lots and lots of pubs on Rose street which is closer to Princes street, you can find plenty of choice or even pub crawl the street (if you are feeling brave).

For the most upmarket try George street, with plenty of bars beside the more glamorous clubs, expect to spend alot more money here.

Both had pretty solid pass completion stats (low to mid 80s%).

In terms of all around game - its a difficult call, Holtby had excellent throughball, assists and dribble stats at Schalke backed up with solid tackling and interceptions. Eriksen, is a key pass and assist monster. They both occupy a similar position but play it in a very different way.

Ted Knutson at Statsbomb.com has done a couple of radars illustrating my points which I've tweeted here: https://twitter.com/Iheke/status/509732552798904320

My personal view, having reflected upon our transfer window performance is that the transfers carried out were designed to reduce the wage bill rather than significantly strengthen the squad. I can only imagine that Stambouli is cheaper than Sandro - age is similar, stats are similar - he is less injury prone too but I don't believe that this was the key driver. The rumours around Lennon seemed to be another geared towards reducing the wage bill - I think everyone recognises we lack a bit of pace (without Walker) and I think everyone realises his offer is different to Townsend but having served at the club for so long I would suspect he is by now a high earner. Bearing in mind we already have Dembele/Paulinho/Townsend/Lennon in that area something had to give and it was Holtby.

I don't know. I can't help that feel that to beat ISIS and their ilk - I mean truly beat them on a fundamental ideological level, not just break their 'state' - we'll need to take cues from Islamic culture and heroes.

Saladin was known in part due to his gracious and generous treatment of prisoners. A curious thing about him is that he was remembered and lionized in the West for a long time when he wasn't in the East, despite the fact he was ""their"" greatest enemy, in a sense. While the Europeans somewhat embellished his good character - he was a medieval Sultan after all - the fact remains that two of the reasons he won were his fantastic intelligence network and his honourable treatment of his enemies. These are connected.

As Sun Tzu says, one should flatter and comfort prisoners and spies, so as to convert them. If you have a prisoner who is convinced that the world is opposed to him, out to hurt him and oppress him and his, that the servants of his enemy will try to visit every kind of horror on him and he is determined to die a martyr's death for the cause, how far do you think you're going to get with threats and pain and humiliation? Far better to relax him, feed him, convince him of your good intentions, and break his expectations. With time, not only will he tell you everything he knows, freely and willingly, but you'll then have a useful friend in the future. In this specific case, it is far more valuable to us to have reformed ISIS goons as an example to young men than more martyrs or more evidence of the US and their allies' war crimes against Muslims. This is not to mention that Islam itself encourages kindness and forgiveness in the face of your enemies, just as Christianity does.

To put it simply, treating ISIS prisoners, all prisoners kindly and humanely is supported by history, good military sense and both secular and Islamic morality.

This video's kind of treatment may feel like justice, but it is anything but.""

All of this put together is an argument that we should treat ISIS members or former members in a way that many would consider soft. It is the right approach to take, this kind of ""well they've made their beds"" sort of attitude is satisfying but short-sighted.

Bias here, 'cos I'm on the inside, but we can't even fart while prepping lists and updating membership records now for fear of a company challenging (often on spurious grounds, such as a person who died while in service, and neither company nor family notified us gets a ballot paper - so can we chuck the entire ballot out please, because you tried to get a dead person to vote...)

The laws in place now don't allow closed shop, unions aren't allowed to strike 'in sympathy', ballots for action have to be conducted via the Electoral Reform Service and people can be members of any union at any workplace (although further rules of law state that for a union to negotiate pay and conditions for workers X% have to be members of a specific union to allow it to do this.)

Strikes have to be announced after a properly verified ballot result is in favour, and can only be organised after seven days.  

Members regularly vote for their branch representatives, and the executive council body of Unite which decides where and how money is being spent, and what the rule book should say- is formed of lay-members, not waged members of union staff.

As for political striking - again, this isn't allowed.  This in the past was 'sympathy striking' - if company A is on a proper strike, then company B - nothing to do with company A - would strike to, to put more pressure on - that's just not allowed.

The point stands: should diplomats use their privileges, given to them by international law for the purposes of encouraging diplomatic relations between states, to conduct acts which are not only illegal but morally unacceptable in the host state? The answer is clearly no. Will it encourage the host state to change? I don't see why, if anything it creates animosity.  

The example of what we would judged to be ""forced marriage"" does not undermine freedom of consent, it's not perfect but it is a similar grey area in international law. You can have a  person under the age of 16 who in another state is deemed to have reached the age of majority as required by art 16 of the UDHR and thus can marry in that state's embassy. By our definition that cannot be a valid marriage because we have the culturally based legal requirement that both individuals are of at least 16 years, our culture arbitrarily judges that below that they have not reached the age of majority and are thus unable to consent. The UN recommends 18, some countries are 14, others even younger. 

Would it be appropriate for such a marriage to be conducted in London behind the protection of international law regardless of our position: that a 14 year old marrying a 35 year old can only be a forced marriage because one side cannot consent? Would it encourage us to change our opinions?  The answer to both is no.

Firstly, CPO's do not offer ""above market rates"" the compensation principle is equivalence - please bear in mind that CPO's are mostly used by public authorities wanting to carry out public works (e.g. Crossrail and/or HS2) if CPO's paid ""above market rates, then govt wouldn't be able to afford it.

Secondly, the business located here is definitely successful and profitable, its listed as having a turnover of &lt;£6.5m and a balance sheet total of &lt;£3.26m. It has premises specially adapted for the work it carries out and owns the property free of debt.

All of this probably makes striking a deal incredibly difficult. Obviously, the Local Authority wants the deal done. Spurs want to pay the least possible for the land - to drive down redevelopment costs. 

The business will have a valuation based on winding up (i.e. closing it down completely - this is call extinguishment) and relocation. As I mention above, it owns bespoke premises in a part of London where finding similar premises will be difficult. It has specialised heavy manufacturing equipment. The relocation costs will include: removal, legal fees for acquisition of new site/stamp duty/etc, adaptation, lost profits, depreciation of stock, marketing new location + business consumables (stationery, etc). Whereas extinguishment is like administration - i.e. value of business + forced sale of equipment, etc + redundancy and administration. It is quite easy to guess that there is a **BIG** difference between the two figures. The Local Authority and Club will argue that no reasonable businessman will pay the cost of relocation and therefore will seek to base the CPO figure on extinguishment.

For those that are keen on reading up about this see [this.](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11488/147642.pdf)

In my mind its a flaw in the law - a successful business basically has to accept a low ball offer from the LA and business or face a CPO based on winding them up. The only option for them, in reality, is to challenge the process in the hope of making the process so expensive for the other side that they cough up a bit more in the end.

Here's the Battle Of Hastings...   

I'll tell of the Battle of Hastings, 
As happened in days long gone by,
When Duke William became King of England, 
And 'Arold got shot in the eye.

It were this way - one day in October 
The Duke, who were always a toff
Having no battles on at the moment, 
Had given his lads a day off.

They'd all taken boats to go fishing, 
When some chap in t' Conqueror's ear
Said 'Let's go and put breeze up the Saxons;' 
Said Bill - 'By gum, that's an idea.'

Then turning around to his soldiers, 
He lifted his big Norman voice,
Shouting - 'Hands up who's coming to England.' 
That was swank 'cos they hadn't no choice.

They started away about tea-time - 
The sea was so calm and so still,
And at quarter to ten the next morning 
They arrived at a place called Bexhill.

King 'Arold came up as they landed - 
His face full of venom and 'ate - 
He said 'lf you've come for Regatta 
You've got here just six weeks too late.'

At this William rose, cool but 'aughty, 
And said 'Give us none of your cheek;
You'd best have your throne re-upholstered, 
I'll be wanting to use it next week.'

When 'Arold heard this 'ere defiance, 
With rage he turned purple and blue,
And shouted some rude words in Saxon, 
To which William answered - 'And you.'

'Twere a beautiful day for a battle; 
The Normans set off with a will,
And when both sides was duly assembled, 
They tossed for the top of the hill.

King 'Arold he won the advantage, 
On the hill-top he took up his stand,
With his knaves and his cads all around him, 
On his 'orse with his 'awk in his 'and.

The Normans had nowt in their favour, 
Their chance of a victory seemed small,
For the slope of the field were against them, 
And the wind in their faces an' all.

The kick-off were sharp at two-thirty, 
And soon as the whistle had went
Both sides started banging each other 
'Til the swineherds could hear them in Kent.

The Saxons had best line of forwards, 
Well armed both with buckler and sword - 
But the Normans had best combination, 
And when half-time came neither had scored.

So the Duke called his cohorts together 
And said - 'Let's pretend that we're beat,
Once we get Saxons down on the level 
We'll cut off their means of retreat.'

So they ran - and the Saxons ran after, 
Just exactly as William had planned,
Leaving 'Arold alone on the hill-top 
On his 'orse with his 'awk in his 'and.

When the Conqueror saw what had happened, 
A bow and an arrow he drew;
He went right up to 'Arold and shot him. 
He were off-side, but what could they do?

The Normans turned round in a fury, 
And gave back both parry and thrust,
Till the fight were all over bar shouting, 
And you couldn't see Saxons for dust.

And after the battle were over 
They found 'Arold so stately and grand,
Sitting there with an eye-full of arrow 
On his 'orse with his 'awk in his 'and.",0,1410367760,null,0,false,0,ckei5db,t3_2fzlh5,t1_ckei5db,t3_2fzlh5,null,1427089666,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Is there any evidence he did any of this? Who was he listening to? 

&gt; Head: because I believe we can better create a more equal, a more socially just society together than we can alone.

How? If it's my head you're talking to, you're going to have to expand on that one. 

&gt; Heart: because of the ties that bind us together and would be irreversibly broken by separation.

What a load of sentimental pap. That's not going to help get 100,000 kids out of poverty. 

&gt; And soul: because it is solidarity that built the great institutions like our National Health Service and can tackle the great injustices of our time.

So let us save the NHS by exempting it from TTIP, no? You've gone strangely quiet on that. Your MPs claim that Cameron is dismantling the NHS, but when the SNP agree with them, they're scaremongering? Which is it Ed pal? 

&gt; And making it easier for Scotland to deliver on social justice by devolving more powers on fairer tax, on work, on social security, to the Scottish Parliament. And we will meet the timetable set out by Gordon Brown and Johann Lamont earlier this week and agreed by other Scottish leaders yesterday.

In terms of Tate, he's unregistered for the league campaign and will probably be loaned out within the week for the next three months, so it's fair to say his days as a player for us are effectively over. However he has absolutely earned his place on that wall playing for us in all four divisions, and I think it's fitting that he is included now. Hopefully he'll be on the pitch before our next home game for the recognition he deserves.

As an aside, I hope he gets a testimonial at last next summer. He's a Manchester United youth product and they're his boyhood club, and it's who he wants to play. Extremely unfortunate bad luck has meant we've had them first game of the season twice in a row, which means neither club is willing to have that game so close to a competitive fixture with each other.

Then bringing in Can at 60 minute mark? You have all of last season to be convinced of what contribution Gerrard can make in the team. What has Can done that makes you think bringing off Gerrard and bringing in Can will change the game for the better? He may look like an old lad, but Can is only 20 years old... What are you expecting from this kid?

There are more things to a football game than having the best players on the pitch. You need an experienced player like Gerrard and you need a leader like Gerrard. Not to mention his set pieces give us an immense threat.

Only thing I do agree with is the fact that we do need a replacement. However, I don't see Gerrard passing on the torch just yet.

Firstly, it is amazing.

 The first thing you'll notice is a lack of other people and a huge amount of open space. We have 4million people in an area effectively 96‰ the size of the whole of the United Kingdom (inc N. Ireland). 

Secondly, the space and lack of people come at a price. Wages are low compared to England (you won't build a nest egg to take back) but living costs and housing is equally low (area dependant) the average house price in NZ is £200k. However as a professional you'll find that a major city is your target and given the small number of major 'serious' cities you're likely to be looking at double that price for a house. 

Good news. When I saw a house I literally means a full house. 1 story, fully detached,  3 bedroom, 1 bathroom, kitchen, lounge, separate garage / carport. I currently live in London and am constantly amazed at this point fact that in Auckland I rented a BEAUTIFUL villa, on its own plot, with garden front and back, garage and two stories for only £300 per week.  This was 5 minute drive from the city center (equivalent of London Bridge). 

Bad news. You have to drive. No public transportation. No national rail. Airfares are heinous and intercity rail / bus services are almost completely non existent. Everyone drives in NZ and our infrastructure only reinforces this.

Good news, we are a safe, cultural relaxed country with a high degree of integration and racial acceptance. Especially in the major cities of the north island, the south island is 95% white European, still fairly cool but a little less open of other cultures.

Money. Well the pound buys 2NZD at the moment, and living costs in Auckland (our biggest city) are about the same as London (dollar to pound) however since you'll essentially double your money when you arrive you should be okay. Depending on how big a property / where in the country you want to live you'll find the price is good. 

Bad news; our cities are full of houses and not apartments. As such there is a massive undersupply of properties, especially in our major city, Auckland. For this reason if you have children you'll find actually buying a house could be a torturous affair in terms of time. 

Good news, your property in the UK will probably mean you have the collateral to get a good deal on a house anywhere in NZ. I'm not a home owner so I'm honestly guessing a bit.

Let's get this straight, Gerrard is not a defensive midfielder. He never has been. Rafa had him on the right and then pushed forward to alleviate his defensive duties. He's now the deepest lying midfielder but he's not the most defensive. Allen and Henderson and Coutinho (2 out of those 3) who play ahead of him do most of the pressing and dirty work which allows Gerrard to spray balls from deep. People will argue with me with stats. Don't bother. Being honest *most* not all, of his goals and assists last year were from dead ball situations. 

We play the shape we do to accommodate Stevie, he's in that position and the players ahead of him play the way they play just to fit him in the team for 90 mins. This is fine in the short term, but the question is: How many yards of pace does Stevie have to lose before he's not the first name on the team sheet. Where else can we play him?

true,joethepro36,null,null,"It could be both of those things or neither of them. It could be that some of the girls/police/rapists made poor choices and it could be that the PC culture also prevented the police from acting or the girls coming forward. Life is not so black and white as the either/or shown in your false dichotomy.

The main point is that the girls were underage and any activity with them would be illegal. This grooming was performed entirely by Pakistani Muslims knowing perfectly well that their abuse was being ignored by the authorities for fear of being racist. Political correctness had at least some factor in the long term nature of the abuse in Rotherham.

The facts I would present are that the rapists were either entirely or almost 100% Pakistani Muslims, the police failed to act at least partially because of political correctness and that there very few convictions relating to the abuse. I'm sure you'll agree with these three points, as they are facts.

Religion is undoubtedly one of the factors, if not the main factor to cause the rapists to rape. There are many, many parts of the Koran that permit committing harm to those not Muslim. I know this because I have read it. Whether it has been more of an influence than culture is difficult to determine. From the article it claims that the culture of the men involved has taught them to disrespect women. Any apparent misogyny in this case is just a whitewashed way of saying ""Pakistani culture"". A way that is used to carefully make it sound as if men in general rather than the Pakistani culture are to blame. 

What is certain is that both of these factors have been the primary reasons used by the rapists to act in the way that they did. I take great issue with this article attempting to pin it on to class and simple misogyny. Class is completely irrelevant when it comes to raping someone, I can not possibly imagine a rapist carefully considering the socio-economic position of their victims. These girls may have been from the lower classes but it goes without saying that these victims were simply the easiest pickings around. Their class wouldn't have mattered in the eyes of the rapists, simply looking for easy targets. Misogyny in this case is derived from the apparent religious and cultural teachings taught to these fine gentlemen. Again, attempting to blame men in general through the term is poor writing. It came from their religion and/or their culture.

I mention the left wing specifically because there have been many attempts on the left wing to avoid the elephant in the room; that the perpetrators of the crimes were Pakistani Muslims. This has made those so proud of our multicultural society uncomfortable in admitting the issues of culture and race within our society. Differences in culture and religion have led to self-imposed segregation by these communities, who wish to live their lives the way they see fit, even if it involves preying on the young girls of this nation. This style of many cultures living side by side apparently without issue is laughably naive. Many immigrant communities have isolated themselves deliberately while taking what they can from our tolerant and prosperous society. It is still see as racist in many circles to even criticise multiculturalism or immigration in general. Indeed I have been called a racist just for expressing concern on immigration. It is this lack of criticism, banned under the ideas of political correctness that allowed the abuse to continue.

One of the main points of having an embassy is to improve relations between the countries. Just because staff there *can* do something doesn't necessarily mean they should.

&gt;Salah played his youth football with [El Mokawloon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mokawloon_SC) Hougang Warriors, making a $88 million move that shook the asia region.  He played his debut in their senior team in the [Egyptian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Premier_League) being substituted in on 3 May 2010 in the 1–1 away draw against [El Mansoura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mansoura_SC). During the [2010–11 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_Egyptian_Premier_League) Salah advanced and became a regular in the team. He scored his first goal for them on 25 December 2010 during the 1–1 away draw against [El Ahly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Ahly_SC). He remained a regular for El Mokawloon, appearing in every game of the [2011–12 season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011-12_Egyptian_Premier_League). However, following the [Port Said Stadium disaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Said_Stadium_disaster), early February 2012, the Egyptian Premier League stopped and all subsequent matches were postponed. On 10 March 2012, the [Egyptian Football Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Football_Association) announced their decision to cancel the remainder of the season.

All that said if Scotland does leave the union I think I will start to see it differently.  Certainly the SNP doesn't look like it wants to be a friend with the rest of the UK post-independence with threats about not paying their fair share of the debt etc.

I got this all the time when I moved up north even though it's the same country and less than 200 miles away. And I do the same to anyone who comes to Leicester (because why would you?!). It's because although people do move a lot more than they used to, many people still largely stay in the same areas. Even though we are a small country we don't tend to travel large distances. I think it's more about curiosity than a disconnect.

ouch. 

&gt; In our opinion Scotland would fall into a deep recession. We believe deposit flight is both highly likely and highly problematic (with banks assets of 12x GDP) and should the Bank of England move to guarantee Scottish deposits, we expect it to extract a high fiscal and regulatory price (probably insisting on a primary budget surplus). The re-domiciling of the financial sector and UK public service jobs, as well as a legal dispute over North Sea oil, would further accelerate any downturn. In our opinion, as North Sea oil production slows, we estimate that the non-oil economy would need a 10% to 20% devaluation to restore competitiveness. This would require a 5% to 10% fall in wages, driven by a steep rise in unemployment.

2) Police aren't in on it, Vastra is a known crime fighter in that time but you find out more about her in Season 5/6. As for the doctor, nobody *really* knows who he is unless they've met him before.


3)No, stop, turn around, go to the first season since the show's revival (the one with Christopher Ecclestone and Billie Piper). That first season isn't *fantastic* (you'll see what I did there) but I still liked it, and it gets better, and you have more knowledge of everything when you catch up.


4)Sarah Jane and Torchwood are only very slightly linked. Sarah Jane once traveled with the doctor and Torchwood, well, you'll see but both appear in the end of season 4. Doctor Who, Sarah Jane Advenutres and Torchwood are all set in the same world but are completly different shows that have crossovers now and then but aren't vital to the plot. I must say though, Torchwood is quite good, it's like a dark gritty crime-drama version of Doctor Who.

5) Yeah, sometimes there are some odd things that don't make the most sense, but does science fiction ever get the science part right?

6)The people? Who's that? Some people do, if they are from the future (relative to us) or if they've met the doctor, or if they are aliens. In most cases though they don't really, though by Season 8 the people of earth have lived through enough alien invasions to know something is up. That's the kind of thing you will see develop if you watch from the first season (*well* 'first' season, the one with Christopher Eccleston).

So yeah, hope that helps. I'm glad to see you're enjoying the show. You *can* carry on watching from this season if you want but you might enjoy it a bit more (and eveyrhting will make more sense) if you watch from the first season (2000's reboot first, not the 1950's original first, well, you could, but it would take you forever to catch up).",0,1410374271,null,0,false,0,ckelkqn,t3_2fzw63,t1_ckelkqn,t3_2fzw63,null,1427087531,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

And like I said, it is well known that stadiums have a terrible track record of improving the immediate area. They really only have a track record of making the sport team owner richer, at a cost to the public (even if its something as ""basic"" as years of construction blighting the neighborhood).
To quote an article (linked below):
“Independent academic research studies consistently conclude that new stadiums and arenas have no measurable effect on the level of real income or employment in the metropolitan areas in which they are located. Feasibility studies for professional sports facilities often fail to account for the substitution effect. Individuals generally maintain a consistent level of entertainment spending so money spent on sporting events typically comes at the expense of cash spent in restaurants, on travel, and at movie theaters.”

That's why I'm so excited for this year and the coming years, with Eriksen, Lamela, Walker, Dier, Bentaleb, Kane, etc.

If they come from a family with a large household income the expectation is that the parents contribute a little towards living expenses (£3000 or so maybe?) or that the student gets a part time job. If they come form a low income household then they get extra grants and can be loaned more (or they could get a part time job as well). 

While it may seem a good idea now to pay full tuition fees upfront there are several reasons not to:

* If you don't take the loan your tuition costs more (often &gt;£12,000).
* Student loan repayments aren't like other loan repayments, they only apply above a certain threshold and are deducted like NI or income tax.

* Eventually your student debt will be written off if you don't pay it all back with no consequences (most people don't).

It usually turns out that paying your tuition upfront or even paying it off quickly after graduation (With this kind of pot of money) will mean you effectively lose &gt;£10,000 which otherwise wouldn't have ended up needing to be paid.

I've travelled a bit through the country (Liverpool, Newcastle, Kent) and have never experienced anything other than a bit of ribbing from anyone, and I assume it's been the same for others.

We have a pretty unknown defence/keeper which could be good or could be average, a good midfield but IMO nowhere near Atletico. We do have a world class in form striker and and have good (very good if everyone performs at their best) attackers around him and we have a very good young manager, although he is a bit less experienced in Europe when compared to Simeone. 

The main differences IMO are that they were the top seed and were a lot more experienced than us. The top seed isn't as important as we should be able to get at least 2nd in the group and you have to beat the best teams anyway but it does make it slightly easier. A lot of our players haven't had a proper go in the champions league either which could be a problem but who knows.

Note also
&gt; The unofficial coalition with Goldie's party in the Scottish parliament allowed the SNP, which then had only one seat more than Labour, to outvote Labour and the Lib Dems; after the Scottish Green party provoked a brief crisis by refusing to endorse one budget package, only the Tories kept Salmond's budget package afloat.

Why would the Tories have kept the SNP afloat, if not for some quiet deal? It's not as though they have any great love for the SNP, after all.

The reason for the accusation of hypocrisy is the daft way that the Yes campaign have been accusing Labour of 'getting into bed' with the Tories, or being apologists for their policies, just because they - and the Liberal Democrats - all happen to agree that being part of the UK is the best future for Scotland, and are campaigning together on that point.

Well, yeah. That's what speaking from the heart means. He does explain some of this in the speech, his dad being stationed in Scotland during WW2 and so on.

&gt;That's not going to help get 100,000 kids out of poverty.

One of the few areas where Blairites can still hold their heads up high is in reducing child poverty - in the whole of the UK - against international trends. Labour have got good proposals in this area. I have no idea what the SNP have to say about it, so perhaps you're right. The UK as a whole has almost 2,000,000 children in poverty, so it's not a uniquely Scottish problem. Why not fix it together?

&gt;So let us save the NHS by exempting it from TTIP, no?

TTIP is an EU treaty, which an independent Scotland will presumably still be beholden to, including NHS bullshit, given most Scots' desire to remain in/join the EU.

&gt;So we have to vote no, and then vote for a Labour government (something we've been doing since the '50s without success), and then we might get some undefined powers?

Maybe this is because I have Scottish grandparents (from Kilmarnock) but I've been there many times, meeting family or going on holiday, and I've never felt foreign or unwelcome for being English. I enjoy the rivalry between our nations but I've nothing but respect for Scotland's heritage and I would be deeply saddened if Scotland left the UK - of course I accept that's for the Scots to decide though.

As for your points; don't you think a Shetland islander might also feel self-conscious about their identity in Edinburgh or Glasgow, as if they were abroad?

true,xzisium,null,null,"His defensive work is hit and miss but I don't think it is so drastic that he needs dropping for it. When I look at the alternatives, I see Lucas, Allen, and Can as the ones who would be in line to play that position if Gerrard stepped down. 

I am not a fan of Lucas anymore (injuries ruined what could have been a great player) so he's out straight away. I like what I have seen of Can but he is still a bit of an unknown in a Liverpool shirt so I couldn't honestly say whether I think he could step up or not.

Allen would have a good case for it - his short passing around corners, in tight angles, and under pressure is superb. This type of thing would be very handy in those times where he's facing our goal with an opposition player pressing him. His defensive ability is probably on a par with Gerrard aswell. What he doesn't have is the range of passing that Gerrard does and, in my view the most important thing Gerrard has over the others, the leadership qualities. The long passing is not vital to the way we play but sometimes being able to pick out a fullback high up the pitch with a 40 yard ball is very useful. As for the leadership, well, no one in our squad matches Gerrard for that.

In Gerrard's favour too is the set piece ability - I think his corners could be replaced by Coutinho but his whipped free kick into the box like Newcastle last season are brilliant and I'm not sure anyone else could do that as well and as regularly as him. We don't really have anyone that is a free kick scoring specialist so it's not like he's stopping someone from doing that. Maybe one day Raheem Sterling will decide to conquer free kicks for a bit and become dead good at them, I wouldn't put it past him.

So, after all that rambling, I think Gerrard should stay. Allen could be a good alternative for when he needs resting as a different style of holding midfielder (and potentially Can) but the first man for me would be Gerrard. He has certain qualities I don't think anyone else does in our squad. Clearly Rodgers thinks this way too and who am I to say the man who gave us last season is wrong?

As you say, sorting out a big move and a new place is hard work, especially when settling into a new job too. Although the challenge would have its rewards if I can get everything figured out.

Ideally I'd live in Cambridge as it looks nice and there seems to be a lot going on, more people my age group too, with the university. But you're right, finding a nearby village or town might be a better bet!

There are some exceptions to this rule on night work – for those working in hospitals, agriculture, retail, hotels, catering. In addition the rules on night work for this group does not apply when the employer needs the young worker to maintain continuity of service or production, or to respond to a sudden run in demand, and no adult is available to do the work, and compensatory rest is given at the earliest practical opportunity.

It proved deeply unpopular and was seen as the labour government of the time setting the referendum up to fail. The SNP withdrew support for the minority administration, ultimately leading to parliament being dissolved and Thatcher being elected.

For my part I don't think it was a completely bad thing to do, I agree with you that it makes sense to impose more than just a 50%+ requirement regardless of turnout. Peoples' opinions fluctuate and a 51% yes might have been a 51% no had the referendum held place a day or two later. It's also the case that a lot of referendums have poor turnout (though the independence one probably won't), and not placing any turnout requirements leads to major changes being passed based on the wishes of a small share of the population.

A recent example is the 1997 Welsh devolution referendum: 50.3% yes vs 49.7% no on 50.1% turnout. The difference in the votes was 6721 - a major change affecting the whole of Wales was put through based on a number of voters equivalent to the population of a small town, resulting in some regions of Wales where the yes vote was very small being subject to an assembly they did not want. Most people in Wales have come to accept the assembly and want its continued existence, including myself, but I still believe that's absolutely no way to run a referendum. The result did not show beyond reasonable doubt that the will of the welsh people was to have an assembly.

With the 79 referendum though the turnout requirement they imposed was ridiculous, at least 40% of the electorate voting yes would have required at least 80% turnout, a ridiculous figure. Had they set it to 30% instead (meaning a minimum turnout of 60%), that would have been far more realistic and the proposal would have passed.

true,The_Juggler17,null,null,"I'm kind of conflicted on what advice to give. Telling someone to start at the beginning is difficult because there are so many episodes if they just want to catch up.

The show, as a whole, is not serial. (but the plot arc within a single season is) It's not like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad where you need to start from the beginning to enjoy or understand any of it.

.

If you want to start at the beginning (of the new 2005 show) then start with the 9th Doctor, Christopher Eccleston. This is called Series 1. [Here is a pretty good episode guide](http://liztellsfrank.com/2011/07/06/doctor-who-2005-2009-the-skip-itwatch-it-guide/) that shows if you can skip an episode and not miss anything, and which ones you shouldn't miss. Even if you start from here, know that this is a very old show that some people have been following since the 70s. That background is part of the new show, but not necessary to watch. (kind of like Star Trek)

Perhaps you could start with Series 2 with the 10th Doctor, David Tennant. He is widely considered the favorite Doctor by many fans, and his more lighthearted and silly demeanor is very entertaining. He'll be a great contrast compared to the new guy, the dark and grumpy Peter Capaldi.

Perhaps you could start with Series 5 with the 11th Doctor, Matt Smith. He's also very lighthearted and comical, and his companion Amy Pond is a favorite of many fans. His episodes are more grand in scale and dramatic than the others.

And then it would be just fine to start with Series 8 (the currently running season) with the 12th Doctor, Peter Capaldi. Just watch it and enjoy it how it is. Then maybe go back and watch the old stuff after this season is over.

.

Hope this isn't too overwhelming.

The show shouldn't be overwhelming - it's a lighthearted show full of nonsense. It's not meant to be taken too seriously.

Also there might be implications IF the poll holds onto referendum day that the independence supporters loses every region except the central belt.



Glasgow and Highlands have switched back barely into the No camp.

From Issues in British Politics by Colin Pilkington
&gt;During the nineteenth century the ideals of liberty and equality inherited from the French Revolution created the value patterns for two very different, and often opposed, visions of society.

&gt;Liberty, as an aim, became synonymous with libertarianism or the freedom of the individual; which, in turn, came to represent freedom from government interference, defence of an individual's rights and property, the supremacy of the laws of supply and demand, the desirability of competition, and the maintenance of a country's ancient liberties and independence.

&gt;Equality, [which is to say, the aims of modern social liberalism] on the other hand, stressed the collective rather than the individual, so that the individual is prepared to surrender some rights for the common good. From this viewpoint there has to be a distribution of property according to the criterion of fairness...the strong must help the weak, the injustices of the past must be righted and there should be cooperation for the common good both nationally and internationally.

Libertarianism refers to a very different view of what liberty is; centred around freedom rather than equality. I am fairly socially conservative and would call myself a Libertarian Conservative. In the British context, this most likely refers to Thatcherism.",0,1410381553,null,0,false,0,ckephxe,t3_2fxtyg,t1_ckephxe,t1_ckds9jc,null,1427085203,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

It's a map I've made showing etymologies for (Welsh language) place names in and around Wales. It comes with a couple of health warnings, however:
 
1. The meanings provided on the map should be taken with a pinch of salt. There is a very good chance that at least a few of the more obscure etymologies I've included in the map are erroneous. Multiple competing etymologies exist for a number of place names in Wales. Gwynedd, for example, here given as ""Land of the Wild People"", is derived from Proto Irish *Weidh-n-, via Old Irish Féni and Brythonic Vened- to give Welsh Gwynedd. Or, perhaps, it isn't. Perhaps it's derived from the Pictish tribal name Venicones - Gwynedd's semi-mythical founders. Perhaps it's derived from Old Irish fían, meaning ""war band"". Perhaps none of these explanations are correct.
 
2. The map is, as of yet, unfinished. There are quite a few river names on the map (Gele, Mawddach, Aeron, Ogwr, Honddu, Tawe and Hafren), that I haven't been able to find any information on. If anyone can suggest a likely derivation, please let me know. If there are any towns or villages that I've left out and you would like to see included, get in touch! I think I've got room for a few more.

If you get lost, a map showing the untranslated names is available [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kaisermaccleg/14576338576/sizes/l).

In contrast, the No voters are happy being part of the UK, and a Yes vote would permanently deprive them of that (or semi-permanently; there almost certainly wouldn't be a referendum to re-join the UK in most people's lifetimes).

And secondly, the fallout will effect the Conservatives disproportionately. This is why Major has already tried to blame Blair for the referendum (which he's not totally wrong on). However, the Conservatives remain the only party big enough to stop Labour. UKIP won't do it as their support is sporadic and national, rather than focused and constituent based.

**Economic consequences of a surprise ‘Yes’ vote could be significantly negative**

What would happen if we are wrong and Scotland registers a surprise ‘Yes’ vote? In the long run, we see little reason why an independent Scotland could not prosper: there is no evidence to suggest that smaller countries are richer or poorer, on average, than larger countries. However, in the short- to medium-term, the consequences of a surprise ‘Yes’ vote for the Scottish economy, and for the UK more broadly, could be severely negative.

The UK government’s position is that an independent Scotland would not be able to retain Sterling as its currency. Pro-independence campaigners argue that, in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote, the UK government would quickly change its stance because retaining a monetary union would be “overwhelmingly” in its interests.

However, in our view, the threat to disband the Sterling monetary union with Scotland is credible. One of the main lessons from the Euro area crisis is that a reasonably high degree of fiscal and/or financial integration is necessary, as a means of effective risk sharing, for a monetary union to work. Without political and fiscal integration, it is difficult to see the rest of the UK agreeing to provide a monetary and financial backstop to Scotland.

A separate challenge for an independent Scotland is that it would face a significant budget adjustment if it is to put its fiscal position on to a more sustainable path. Under the terms of the existing ‘Barnett formula’ – a mechanism used by the UK Treasury to adjust the amounts of public expenditure allocated to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland – public spending per head of population in Scotland is materially higher than in the rest of the UK, despite income per capita in Scotland being broadly in line with the rest of the UK. Scotland currently receives significant fiscal transfers from the rest of the UK and, given that it has an older demographic profile than the rest of the UK, the size of the net transfers from the rest of the UK to Scotland is likely to increase over time.

Filling this gap in the event of independence would be painful and is likely to require a significant reduction in the provision of public services. In the long run, an independent Scotland would likely have a smaller public sector than would be the case if it maintained its union with the UK.

An additional burden for an independent Scotland as it makes this fiscal adjustment is that, with no track record in the sovereign debt market and with institutions that are as yet untested, the Scottish government (and Scottish households and corporates) would likely face a higher rate of interest on their borrowing.

The consequences of a 'No' vote would largely depend on the size of the majority. If the majority is reasonably large (say, 5-10 percentage points or more), then the referendum is likely to draw a line under the issue for some time. However, if the majority is less than 0-5pp, there are likely to be moves towards greater Scottish independence within the UK ('devo max') and the process of seeking another referendum could start again reasonably quickly.",0,1410383566,null,0,1410384383,0,ckeqlf1,t3_2g146p,t1_ckeqlf1,t3_2g146p,null,1427084691,74,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,74

Quite Frankly playing at the Emirates makes the absolute most sense. 


Firstly, we get to stay in North London, where we belong. Where the fans can reach. Where we have a connection. And despite having to walk in Arsenal areas for the matches, how is that different to walking through West Ham areas? Or Milton Fucking Keynes? I don't know if anyones been to watch a game up there, but if you're not driving, good luck. It's in the middle of fucking nowhere. Yes there might be more of an atmosphere before the game with some of their fans in the area, but is that not why we go to the game? For the atmosphere? Surely, walking down a lively highstreet before the game beats the empty heartlessness of Milton Keynes, or the neutrality of Wembley, which would most likely be empty in places.


Secondly, We can fill it every week. We know we can. Everyone does. Thats why our capacity is coming in at sixty, not a hundred thousand. We know we can fill it, and we won't look stupid. MK has a small stadium, thereby a large amount of us fans would be unable to get to see the games. Going to a reduced stadium capacity that far out of London makes no sense. 


Thirdly and my last point for now. You have to admit it would give us the urgency to ensure that the stadium is delivered. We wouldn't want to be in arsenal stadium for a long time, but imagine we moved a large distance away, and the chairman 'liked it'. The push would be reduced i feel somewhat. 


Regardless, I know my opinion of this is most likely heavily unpopular, but rest assure I've been to a lot of games at WHL.

I grew up there til I was 18 + a few uni holidays so like I say my perspective isn't that of a adult with a job, but fwiw. 

Plus

- Small town, very flat and bike friendly, so even if you live somewhere pretty well on the outskirts, assuming you're fit and healthy your transport costs can be approx 0
- Obviously lots of beautiful uni architecture, punting on the river, loads of parks and all that shit (as a local I'm obliged to slightly snark at it but in serious mode I do think urban realm of that quality can really affect quality of life)
- the population is [much more professional and educated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge#Demography) than most places, obviously not saying all manual workers or non degree holders are idiots or dickheads, but, well, ""Idiocracy"" / anti-intellectual sentiments don't thrive in Cambridge, there's something in the air that's sort of intellectually aspirational... ah, hard to describe 
- Sort of relating to the above - good economy, silicon fen, science park, uni spin offs and startups ahoy, so plenty of possibilities for new &amp; improved career changes/directions
- 45 mins to KX; if you get bored of small town you could possibly beat me to Fabric and I live in london
- unlike many towns that close to London, it's not economically dependent on it / dormitory town
- nightlife isn't overall a big plus imo tbh (see below) but the Junction &amp; Corn Exchange do pull some good names so it's not a dead loss by any means either
- pretty much my favourite thing in Cambridge, lol: [Reality Checkpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_Checkpoint)

Minus

- small town.  let's be honest here it's not even the biggest town in cambridgeshire, a county not known for its metropolii
- town v gown.  added to which, because the colleges have their own bars and balls and events, it doesn't even get the nightlife boost you might expect from a uni city really.  can be a bit jarring when you know Clare College had &lt;famous band/DJ&gt; and your only option is &lt;whatever Chicago's is called this year&gt;, again.  go in some pubs and all that classy uni stuff is a million miles away, it's proper sawdust on the vom patch, LEAVE HIM SHIRLEY E'S NOT WORF IT, same as any other small town nightlife.  i suppose this may count as a plus point lol
- town v gown 2: moron boogaloo.  moron students on bikes mowing you down on the pavent or drifting in front of your car, moron clouds of moron tourists dithering in your way, their moron tour bus blocking the road, etc, etc
- the scenery, as you have already observed, is flat and dull as fuck

Brown as Chancellor saw the largest deregulation of the UK derivatives market there's ever been. This led to the UK controlling over 40% of the entire world's derivatives- the very market that US sub-prime mortgages were repackaged and traded in, the cause of the crash. Brown in 2007 boasted of this deregulation, only a year before his government's policy and the UK banking sector were utterly complicit in market failure.

Yet we claim that we were the victims of a global systemic collapse. As economist  Irwin Stelzer (also a huge critic of George Osborne) said: ""It seems Britain is the victim of a disease that originated in America, and magically crossed the ocean to infect perfectly healthy British banks — the very institutions that were writing mortgages valued at 125 per cent of the value of homes, issuing millions of credit cards and not checking financial statements of borrowers, all under the eyes of regulators attempting to implement the trifurcated regime created by then chancellor Gordon Brown.""

But even if UK deregulation didn't help cause the failure of the global financial system (which it did), the UK was uniquely poorly positioned due only to a decade of government irresponsibility. Household debt doubled, manufacturing shrank within the economy 4x as much as it did under the entirety of *Thatcher's* time as PM, down both comparatively and in real terms. Where everything else in the economy shrunk financial services increased by 40% and real estate 33%, the only growing parts of the economy. We essentially had a decade long productivity contraction whilst overseeing an asset and debt bubble.

Then with a shitload of government debt following even the good times, and bailing out the market that the government turned into a bubble, there was not the slack to spend our way out of trouble and only monetarism and thus austerity represented a way out. All that after inheriting the strongest economy in UK history.

So yeah, Brown empirically did damage the nation's economy, global crisis or not. He himself too, along with Alan Greenspan, was the most culpable public figure for creating the framework under which the credit crunch could happen.

I understand the dissatisfaction with British politics, but breaking up the UK because of that would have far bigger and more damaging consequences. I'd say it's far more likely life would be harder for all involved; Scotland would suddenly have all the troubles of being a small nation on the global stage, combined with being a new country with no currency or treaties, and trying to sort out a constitution under the rule of brand new MPs in a brand new parliament, under the guidance of a left-leaning, nationalist party with a leader who has nothing more to offer than sound-bites and Braveheart.  

Meanwhile, the remainder of the UK would have a Tory government with a majority of 42, or 108 if you count the Lib Dems. This would be concerning, purely from a democratic stand point.
