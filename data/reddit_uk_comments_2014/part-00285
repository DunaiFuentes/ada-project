My base went from 18k to 18.25k. My point is commission and the way in which you are targeted and paid on your results can make a huge difference in sales.

It's vital you speak to your colleagues in the role you are going into and get an understanding of if the targets are realistic, what on target earnings would be, what you will get if you over or under achieve. Ask them what they earned in their 1st, 2nd year etc, and then decide if you feel comfortable with the base against realistic earning potential. Ultimately if most of your salary will be commission based, what your expected commission will be is far more important than your underlying 'salary', and it's likely the management and directors would expect someone going into sales to be far more interested in the commission structure than their predictable, base salary.

That would be quite difficult to analyse. Schools in special measures or assessed as ""inadequate"" are coerced by DfE to convert into sponsored academies, with a private sector sponsor chosen by DfE. (*)

Obviously a failing school has only one way to go; the question is whether becoming an academy helps it to improve faster than it would under the status quo ante.

If you live anywhere with hedgerows, you might be familiar with the two great blooms of white blossom each spring - the hawthorn, which flowers before it sets leaf in late February or March; and the blackthorn or maythorn which sets leaf first and then flowers in April or early May, and those are literally the darling buds of May. Remember where the blackthorn blossoms and from September until the first hard frosts there you will find sloes.

 We have to accept our role in causing this mess (the last time we invaded, for example, but also a much longer rotten history in the ME). The instinct to act may come from a good moral impulse for lots of people, but the reality is that Britain has assisted in reducing Iraq to rubble, fuelling sectarianism, destablising the region, supporting authoritarian states, carving up artificial borders, leading us to the current awful situation. It is an asinine assumption that *something* must be done by Britain.

Nevetheless, on the provisio that that much is understood by policy makers, there are concrete things that could be done: Basic assistance to Kurdish forces, encouragement to other regional powers to play a role (Iran, Turkey) in containing ISIL.

The Battle of the Diamond was a defining moment for Unionism in general. I mean, wasn't the Battle of the Diamond the catalyst for the Orange Order? It seems like a minor squabble to raise that one in particular, given what happened in the subsequent months to Catholics in the surrounding area. The Battle of the Diamond was an event that defined the notion of Unionism that we see today.

false,[deleted],null,null,"Personally I don't think so.

Background: IT contractor. Very suspicious, dubious about recruiters.

What's the job of a recruiter? Make a commission. How? Volume. They want to place people into jobs as quickly as possible.

How does a recruiter get his candidate placed? Talk them down in salary so that the company gets a great candidate at a bargain price.

So your CV gets picked up by automated keyword search functions at each agency. Then you get a half ton of phone calls and e-mails asking if you're appropriate for a job and, if not, do you know someone who is? Recruiters are lazy and they want you to find candidates for them.

You end up fielding spam calls and spam e-mails all trying to place you into positions for which you're underqualified while expecting you to take a fraction of your current salary.

---

Me? I basically find a role advertised I think is appropriate. Then I'll call the specific agent at his agency and talk to him (or her) directly - asking where is the role based, what salary, etc. Only after we've had a chit chat will I forward my CV with the express stipulation my CV is not to be forwarded without my written permission.

Note that recruitment agents believe (rightly or, in my opinion, wrongly) that if they are the first ones to forward your CV to a particular company then they have the right to a commission if that company employs you later.

---

Agents do not work for you. They kinda work for the companies they are recruiting for.

Agents do not see you as a human being. They see you as a means of making an income. How you feel, what is respectful, etc does not enter into an agent's thinking.

Agents do not want you to know the truth. They stand between you and a potential company. What they tell you could be anything different from what they're telling the company. You'll never know.

They have no 2G network, so it means you will always get good speeds, at this point all 2G masts have been upgraded to 3G masts or 4G masts so you won't miss out on any signal.

Three has a service called Feel at Home with all of their contracts which allows you to use your calls, texts and data abroad for no extra cost in certain countries (they are trying to expand that though).

They have started sharing mast locations and backhaul with EE to speed up their 4G rollout, in my city it's going well. I can easily pull 30Mb/s down 30Mb/s up with 3-5 bars.

**All of Three's contracts are 4G contracts, usually at the same or cheaper than other phone providers costs for comparable 3G contracts**

If you have previously tried them and been disappointed with their signal, they have definitely improved, but like every phone provider they do have black spots.

Three's ""fair use policy"" is pretty good, you can use as much as you like without throttling but if you use P2P (torrenting) past 3PM (Correct me if I'm wrong) it will be throttled a lot.

Here's some extra things to consider though: Three's indoor signal penetration isn't great (though not terrible for me) because of the 3G frequencies they use being suited for speed rather than building penetration. They do have band 20 4G which runs on the old TV frequencies, this is fast and has good building penetration so hopefully as 4G expands signal indoors will get better.

Also despite what other people have experienced, I've found Three's customer support to be easy, efficient and helpful.

I then get a car come up behind me, and stay close for 5-10 minutes. When I start to come into a small village further on, the lights come on, I instantly put my indicators on and pull into a layby as soon as possible, expecting them to carry on past me. They follow me into the layby and I start to think 'Shit. Was I speeding? (My speedo isn't lit so I have to guess the speed). I couldn't have been speeding, it was a natioal speed limit, what the fuck did I do?'

I put the stand out, turn off the engine and the officer comes up to me and says 'Are you aware you're rear light is out?'.

My response 'Ah shit no I wasn't.' I had a screwdriver under the seat, so I pop the lens off and sure enough, the filament for the rear light is gone, but the brake light is still good. I ask what he suggests, I didn't exactly have a spare bulb with me. 

He then checks I my name, so he knows I am insured and legal to ride the bike. After, he comes back from the car, asks me where I am headed. I tell him where, he replies 'OK, we are on our way through there, so we will follow you there to make sure no-one hits you because they didn't see you, and you need to get a new bulb and get it sorted as soon as possible. And don't ride til it is sorted' 

All very reasonable of him, I was expecting a fine or something.

false,intangible-tangerine,eng-Bristol,Brizzlefoshizzle,"The debate here seems to mirror very closely that for religious schools. Divided between the people who attended them and know that the majority are really good learning institutions and those who blanket oppose them for political reasons or because they have a very stereotyped view which takes the worst outlier examples and tars every one with the same brush. 

I attended a City Technology College which is now an academy. Overall my experience was good. We stuck to the national curriculum, the sponsorship companies didn't have any direct input on lessons other than funding and offering a few work experience and apprenticeship places. Their motive for getting involved was that Bristol has lots of companies that need engineers, mathematicians, mechanics etc. It was nothing underhand, it wasn't evil market capitalism, it was just local companies trying to help a school give kids the skills they'd need in the workplace. We had a normal mixed comprehensive intake, the same as any other local comprehensive school, but we had exam results that were miles ahead of them. The money helped, but really the key was that our school felt special. The fact that we had industry involvement meant we understood why we were there, we understand why we needed GCSE maths and what it would mean for our future employment opportunities. I really want to stress here, it wasn't Pepsi and Coca-cola at our school, it was local businesses and international ones with strong local presences who had relationships with us that lasted years. Many of my friends owe their careers to this.   

I also went to a Church of England infant school that was fairly good under difficult circumstances. Huge classes (60 kids in one class!) and a crumbling building because it was during the last Tory government who wouldn't invest in the public sector as a matter of principle. If we hadn't had CofE support I don't know if the school would have survived. 

People who moan about PFI and 'wasted spending' under Labour annoy me greatly, sometimes when it rained our roof would leak, we had 120 children crowded in to two rooms so we used a portacabin as a makeshift classroom for a bit, but it was freezing in the winter. We needed building repairs and it needed to happen quickly. It simply wasn't within the capability of the public sector to do that within a reasonable time frame, it needed private sector expertise and funding. Yes of course it was expensive, but if you ignore the basic structural needs of buildings for decades there's going to be a big cost involved if you're making emergency repairs to a deadline, or sometimes having to rebuild from the foundations. 

I also went to a normal government run, LEA comprehensive school. It was not terrible, but it didn't have the driving ethos of the Church of England school or the Technology college. It lacked a sense of identity and purpose other than ticking boxes for OFSTED and SATS results. 

My CofE school and the Technology college both sought to offer something above and beyond the core curriculum. For the CofE school this was an understanding of one's own internal moral compass and an appreciation of how we impact others. (Contrary to what some might think there was no pressure to be Christian and the intake was mixed faith.) and for the Technology College this was an understanding of the Workplace, particularly in the technology sector. 

My Political Ideology wants the LEA comprehensives to be the best ones. I'm a left-wing agnostic Labour voter. I really want the Government run, secular schools to be head and shoulders above the rest. But my own experience tells me otherwise. 

I'm aware that I had the fortune of going to a good CofE school and a good Technology college. Of course there are instances when these institutions go wrong for whatever reason. But we'd be making a huge mistake to bar all non-governmental bodies from being involved in eduction, it's just a case of managing that input so that it's productive and benefits all kids, not just a lucky few.

In an ideal world you'd ask this question and get honest answers. In the real world, people will judge you for even asking, assume you're after their job, look down on you if you don't earn the same commission as they did in their first few years, and perhaps even report you to their bosses for asking in the first place. Not everyone, but many. Enought to make the risk not worth taking, especially as OP is a newb. Asking colleagues what they earn is a huge, unwritten no-no. If they volunteer the information, that's absolutely fine. But in a commission based environment I would take the majority of answers with a pinch of salt unless they are really, really good mates of yours.

People are REALLY bloody funny about their earnings, and employers even more so. So it's best not to even go there.

&gt;It's vital you speak to your colleagues in the role you are going into and get an understanding of if the targets are realistic, what on target earnings would be, what you will get if you over or under achieve.

This is acceptable, but I'd prefer it if OP approached the boss rather than colleagues. 'He got so I should get' is a really shit method of doing your financial planning. You want to take it straight from the boss, take notes of what was said, and set a reminder for when the boss said it was time to review financial stuff to ensure it happens. Go to that meeting prepared; because you've taken notes at the initial discussion, you'll be able to repeat back to them what they said and promised. It's important not to paraphrase here. Write down their *exact* words. Focus in on the most important things if you are a bit crap at writing quickly.

I know clandonwick's intentions are only good for you, but you could make a lot of people feel uncomfortable and open yourself up to some trouble in the future if you start asking colleagues about money. It's almost as un-British as not drinking tea or not standing politely in a queue, except it could get you in an awful lot more shit.

We goto the rental offices and I advised we had all our paperwork and the details of the place we were renting but as I was a first time renter I was simply looking to clarify some of the fee's and charges.   Letting fee, occupancy fee, signing fee, keyring fee, etc. I was told that they were standard administration fees for filing official documentation, I casually looked at the 3 younger other people in the office who weren't doing anything and stated that £150 administration fee for photocopying the forms that **I** spent time filling out seemed ridiculous.  I've never seen someone turn from the nicest old lady to the most sour face bitch so fast. She was the oldest person of the three in the office so I would say she was likely part owner or wife of owner of the company.  Her words were pure venom, when she said that in fact that property was no longer available.  I simply said thank you and that I wouldn't take up anymore of your valuable time, I'm not usually this quick witted but it makes me smile still.  
That place was still on the market for 3 months. The problem is that they have the keys, if you want them you'll have to pay for them, if you want to keep them you'll have to keep paying them.  
When we rented our first place in Australia I queried the lack of fees with our agent and she was shocked that they were able to get away with that.

No political activity was permitted in the Congo whatsoever. That wasn't the Belgians ""going over"". That was the Belgians *forcible invading* the Congo.  You think the Congo welcomed the Belgians with tea and biscuits?

&gt; **Killed some people, treated others harshly**

Oh, silly Africans, shouldn't be getting killed by the white man! Their typical burden! 

But hang on...

&gt; Failure to meet the rubber collection quotas was punishable by death.

&gt; Meanwhile, the Force Publique were required to provide a hand of their victims as proof when they had shot and killed someone

&gt; As a consequence, the rubber quotas were in part paid off in chopped-off hands.

&gt; Soldiers made young men kill or rape their own mothers and sisters.

&gt; s a young man, I saw [Fiévez's] soldier Molili, then guarding the village of Boyeka, take a net, put ten arrested natives in it, attach big stones to the net, and make it tumble into the river...

&gt; In practice, soldiers sometimes ""cheated"" by simply cutting off the hand and leaving the victim to live or die.

The casualty rates are assumed to be about 15% of the Congolese population, or perhaps 5 - 10 million Congolese native Africans.

&gt; **but paid for and built infrastructure**

No. No no no no no no. This is the *worst* excuse used for colonialism. Everyone assumes that the term ""infrastructure"" equals life improvement. However, do you think that the steam trains were state funded transport for the Congolese natives? No, it was operated by harshly treated Africans, who faced the threat of death, where it went straight from mines to the coast.

&gt; barring blacks from entering the same establishments whites frequented

Yes, that includes ""infrastructure"".

&gt; **albeit on the resources of the country**

Understatement of the year. Huge amounts of copper, cobalt and gold were mined from parts of the Congo. They weren't used to fund the Congolese economy, they were used to be sold to the European Empires.

&gt; **created jobs**

Top kek!

&gt; Congolese peasants were forced to grow certain cash crops (cotton, coffee, groundnuts) destined for the European market. 

You think these cash crops were used to spice their morning and make them designer clothes? Again, fuck no. They were used to exploit and profit for the Belgians.

&gt; an extensive plantation economy developed.

This wasn't friendly Mexican plantations. The white colonists came in, confiscated the land, killed the Africans, and farmed the land using their forced labour.

Our presence is largely cosmetic- we don't *have* to be doing the work in Syria, as long as we're seen standing with the Americans in the dirty work in Iraq- which, in fairness, is where most of the heavy lifting is.. 

The RAF, against the USAF, is a fairly small force. We wouldn't really make all that much difference either way, given the sheer amount of British air power that's been scrapped under this government and the last. The last time the RAF was militaraily relevant was the Cold War- nowadays, Britain's force projection abilities are at best a convenient part of NATO.

I'm sad we're going in, but only because the UN ought to have authorised an intervention sooner. This case is *exactly* what the R2P idea was built around- if we don't go in here, where the aggressive power is *committing genocide and taking slaves*, where would we go in? A time portal to 1943?

I wouldn't object to placing NATO troops on the ground, but, frankly, only if conditions were such that they'd be the best option.

“I left Doctor Who because I could not get along with the senior people. I left because of politics. I did not see eye-to-eye with them. I didn’t agree with the way things were being run. I didn’t like the culture that had grown up, around the series. **So I left, I felt, over a principle.**

I thought to remain, which would have made me a lot of money and given me huge visibility, the price I would have had to pay was to eat a lot of shit. I’m not being funny about that. I didn’t want to do that and it comes to the art of it, in a way. I feel that if you run your career and– we are vulnerable as actors and we are constantly humiliating ourselves auditioning. But if you allow that to go on, on a grand scale you will lose whatever it is about you and it will be present in your work.

If you allow your desire to be successful and visible and financially secure – if you allow that to make you throw shades on your parents, on your upbringing, then you’re knackered. You’ve got to keep something back, for yourself, because it’ll be present in your work.  A purity or an idealism is essential or you’ll become– you’ve got to have standards, no matter how hard work that is. So it makes it a hard road, really.

You know, it’s easy to find a job when you’ve got no morals, you’ve got nothing to be compromised, you can go, ‘Yeah, yeah. That doesn’t matter. That director can bully that prop man and I won’t say anything about it’. But then when that director comes to you and says ‘I think you should play it like this’ you’ve surely got to go ‘How can I respect you, when you behave like that?’

So, that’s why I left. My face didn’t fit and I’m sure they were glad to see the back of me. The important thing is that I succeeded. **It was a great part. I loved playing him. I loved connecting with that audience.** Because I’ve always acted for adults and then suddenly you’re acting for children, who are far more tasteful; they will not be bullshitted. It’s either good, or it’s bad.

Definitely agree that this is a textbook R2P issue.

I don't need to tell you which historical criminal organization I'm referring to; you were already thinking it.

Ruling out putting boots on the ground would be foolish - because it would be dishonest; if boots need to be put on the ground any political leader worth his salt will break that promise, and anyway it doesn't make sense to publicize to the enemy what you won't do.

The current strategy of letting neighbouring countries take a leading role is an important one, but are they truly equipped for dealing with this threat? Iraq's soldiers have received quite a substantial amount of training, has it helped them at all? If we supply them with ground-based hardware, do they have the expertise to use it properly, in a way that could possibly compare to Western forces? How loyal are they really to this fledgling government?

People argue that intervening in this part of the world creates fertile ground for organizations like ISIS to thrive - I've always found that a bit of a contentious point anyway, but when ISIS is already thriving, it surprises me that they still cling to this argument.

Just to counter that view I'd like to illustrate to OP why it's worth having your CV online, but not necessarily with Monster.

Agents search for key words when they are desperate. There are times in the market in which people will absolutely refuse to move job, which is almost always for financial reasons. The job market from October through to the end of January (industry dependent, obvs) is pretty dire. Towards the end of the year, people don't want the faff of changing jobs because they have Christmas present/travel plan commitments. In December and January they stay in their jobs to pay off their post-Christmas sizeable credit card bills. At the end of Jan that is usually all done and dusted, so people start to look for roles until approximately July when most of the UK pisses off on holiday.

I found my last job via having a CV uploaded online and getting a call out of the blue from an agent, and I've since had at least four in-house recruiters contact me via job sites or LinkedIn.

The key to being successful in these searches is to have the right key words in your CV.

I seriously doubt the kid or the glass breaking in Listen have anything to do with it though.  

What I do think might be possible is the idea that the TARDIS possibly when to Gallifrey, if that is really where the young Doctor was. Here is my theory on what could happen:

We know that Clara told him to take off and not to look where they had been, so he has no idea that they were on Gallifrey (This theory assumes that it actually was Gallifrey).  At some point, maybe the Doctor learns that Clara witheld this information from him and it adds another complication to their relationship which is already being complicated by her interest in Danny Pink.  I could imagine the Doctor being so angry about the fact that she lied to him that he kicks her off the TARDIS.  It would be quite a twist on the companion exit.  All of the recent companions have either left without drama, or their leaving has caused great sadness for the Doctor.  I think it would be an excellent twist to have the Doctor be so angry at Clara that he tells her to leave.  It would be made even more significant by the fact that it is Clara, who has had such a major impact on his life.  We've certainly seen a darker angrier side of the Doctor with Capaldi, so I don't think it could be out of the realm of possibility that he would snap.

Clara drops a bit of a bomb shell on Danny that shifts the tone of the conversation. What's a common sound that when heard would interrupt whatever it is you're doing? Something smashing. Smashing sound effects also give the impression that something is wrong, you fucked up because you're not supposed to drop a glass of wine and make a mess on the floor. Damn it, you ruined the carpet! Clara and Danny were in a restaurant, the most likely thing that can be dropped in this setting are the drinks (plates of food too but a glass is more subtle and waiters are much more competent than customers).  

All the semiotics of a smashing glass sound effect are in place because everyone knows what it means. So when one character makes a shocking revelation that ruins the evening, you can drop in a subtle little sound effect that reinforces to the viewer that the situation just got difficult. That Clara just made an epic fuck up.

Also, you neglected to point out the tender music between them cuts out at exactly the same time, making the conversation very awkward. Say, you don't think this sudden stopping of music has anything to do with the series 8 story arc, do you? Will this epidemic of ceasing music be explained in the last episode? No, because that's another little audio trick.

No coincidence, no paranoid theories about how this broken wine glass will somehow be explained in the finale and reveal the truth about Missy and The Promise Land. Just very good audio design in an episode with already impeccable audio.

Why Geoffrey used lions it's hard to say. The badge was granted by Henry I, but was probably just making official an emblem he already used. Lions in heraldry symbolise strength, valour and royalty.

He controls the Harris Federation, which holds over a dozen schools in London. Lord Harris has also donated almost half a million pounds to the Conservatives in recent years.


Lord Stanley Fink, another Conservative member of Lords, and both formerly and presently treasurer of the Conservative Party (he's taken the post twice). Chairman of ARK Academies, which controls 18 schools. Lord Fink has donated over $2.6 Million to the Conservative party. 


Lord John Nash, yet another Conservative member of Lords. Established Future Academies, which holds 4 schools in London. Lord Nash's lordship made him eligible to become Parliamentary Under Secretary for Schools, which he did, immediately after becoming a Lord. Whether that's a coincidence, or whether David Cameron awarded him the Lordship specifically to allow him to take that job is something I won't speculate on here. Lord Nash has also donated £300k to the Conservative Party.


Alan Lewis, another former Conservative Party Treasurer is the 'patron' of an academy in Bradford, and also owns the land on which the school resides. Mr Lewis is set to be paid £12 million in public funds as rent for the land on which the academy exists. The academy in question was investigated by the Department of Education's Internal Audit team, and found guilty of financial irregularities, nepotism and fraud.


All of the aforementioned Academy chains practice something called 'topslicing', in which the Academies write off profits (which, as charities, they cannot make) by paying six figure salaries to 'administrative staff' and headteachers, who perform jobs which are performed for dramatically lower pay in the public sector (I will also note that several of these staff have also been awarded knighthoods by David Cameron in the past few years). Topslicing is one of a few methods which these pseudocharities use to extract profits. This wouldn't be quite so bad if the academies were truly privatised, and the profit was just that, profit. Unfortunately it isn't. Taxpayer money still funds these schools, enabling the pseudocharities that run them to engage in creative accounting to allow them to funnel taxpayer money (as opposed to actual profit) into their pockets.",0,1411790537,null,0,false,0,cktp7xa,t3_2hifjs,t1_cktp7xa,t1_cktb88t,null,1426802958,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

&gt;

&gt;___The Herbs___ is a television series for young children made for the [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) by Graham Clutterbuck's [FilmFair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FilmFair) company. It was written by [Michael Bond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bond) (creator of [Paddington Bear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddington_Bear)), directed by [Ivor Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivor_Wood) using 3D [stop motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion) model animation and first transmitted from 12 February 1968 in the [BBC1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC1) *[Watch with Mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_with_Mother)* timeslot. There were 13 episodes in the series, each one 15 minutes long.

&gt;A spin-off series entitled *[The Adventures of Parsley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Parsley)* was transmitted from 6 April 1970 in the 5-minute period between the end of children's TV and the BBC Evening News. This had 32 episodes, some of which were released on VHS as *Parsley the Lion and Friends*.

&gt;*The Herbs* consisted of a fantasy mix of human and animal characters inhabiting the magical walled garden of a country estate. At the beginning of each episode, the narrator ([Gordon Rollings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Rollings)) spoke the magic word, ""Herbidacious"", which caused the garden gate to open.

In the future he may prove  me wrong and rehab it.   I doubt it though.   

Boyata and Savic are two players who have more natural athletic and footballing ability than Nastasic (imo).    Both though are mistake prone.   Savic seems to have righted this problem since his move away.   I believe Boyata can do the same.

It seems like a minor squabble to raise that one in particular, given what happened in the subsequent months to Catholics in the surrounding area. The Battle of the Diamond was an event that defined the notion of Unionism that we see today. 

I mentioned it specifically it may look the closest to a unionism/nationalism battle but at the time both sides viewed themselves as Irish, certainly a defining moment in the history of unionism but not about unionists. If you look at the battles and skirmishes in that area at the time it would be almost be easily over looked, there was massive sectarian violence in that area. 


Early GOLI meetings the consensus was against Ireland joining the union, 4 or 5 years after the battle of the diamond, I don't know how unanimous that decision was but a year after the 1798 rebellion where there were massive attacks on Anglicans by Catholics and Presbyterians you could understand them being concerned about them getting the vote.
So definitely not unionists, albeit not nationalists either, considering they practically all formed militias or yeomanries in 1798 (which further confuses things as some northern militias literately turned coat when they got to the battle field).

As would I.  To be clear, I'm **not** condoning what his parents did and I hope that the NHS take steps to recover the additional costs from them.  However I don't believe that Ashya should suffer any longer than he has to because his parents are numpties.

&gt;So why are the NHS paying?

The gist of the article seems to be that they don't really have much choice, we have the reciprocal healthcare agreement to cover treatment in other EU countries and the parents have basically forced the NHS's hand.  If they didn't pay up they'd have been ripped to shreds in the press for 'letting poor Ashya die' and now that they have they'll be ripped into for paying for it.

Housing prices - and I say this as a homeowner - are absolutely ludicrous. I honestly have no idea how a young couple fresh out of university - probably with about £80k+ debt between them - are expected to get on the housing ladder. The areas of the country with a strong economy and plenty of jobs for young graduates are exactly the areas with astronomical house prices.

Every answer to this I have seen has revolved around the same basic idea: ""let's increase the amount of debt they have to take on and let them pay it off over a longer time period"", rather than fixing the fundamental problem which is that accommodation and education has increased in price a helluva lot faster than wages have gone up.

This isn't something I've imagined - I graduated in 2002 and typical graduate salaries then for someone with my degree were around £18-22k. Allowing for inflation, they should be £27-30k today.

false,_The_Editor_,null,null,"&gt;1) Because it's September-September, I'll be working in two different tax years. So Both of those years I'll earn under £10k, so I won't pay tax will I?

True. If you earn under the tax allowance in the tax year, you owe no income tax. However the payroll dept at your workplace *may* deduct tax and pay on your behalf. You'll receive this back as a rebate the following year. 

&gt;2) Even though I won't have to pay income tax (I think), will I have to fill out any tax forms in April/May that I've always seen those adverts reminding people to do? Or is it only self employed people that have to do them? My income ill still be taxable, it's just that the government have set it to 0%.

No it should all be handled by payroll/HR. 

&gt;3) My course leader said that I'll still count as a student, so I don't think I'll have to pay council tax? But I'll double check what my status is...

If you pay tuition fees, you owe no council tax. Get a letter/certificate from your uni confirming your status. 

&gt;4) I know that I'll be paying national insurance because of the amount I'll earn. Is there anything else I should be aware of? I do need to check if I'm liable for any tuition fees for that year and if student finance give me anything. 

Yes, you'll provably owe tuition fees.. And you're probably eligible for grant/loan again.

false,Nymthae,null,null,"1) You should be just about fine. Depending on the exact salary you may well end up with a bit of tax on your last payslip. Obviously, throughout the year NI will come out, but shouldn't be anything else. Any company benefits are usually taxable, so if your company reimburses gym memberships for instance - that £200 or whatever will add on to your tax limit. If you qualify for a bonus this also counts.

2) You'll be on PAYE (pay as you earn) so don't worry about it for the first part. Just fill in your P45/P46, check you're being taxed correctly (correct tax code) on your first pay slip and then everything will be sorted. The year after (i.e. after your placement) you might have to fill in something to get tax back, not 100% sure at this point. PAYE I think will keep your tax code over the changing tax year, and you claim back afterwards - incase you earn anything more after your placement. 

3) Correct. Get a certificate of student status from your university stamped/signed and give it to the council office wherever you go. You might live with other students anyway, or if you rent a room from someone as a lodger then speak to them as the discount always helps. They might not change your rental rate though, because it might already be a good deal.

4) Tuition fees are institution dependent. I paid half fees, but with the rise to 9k they might have frozen it at a figure way below half because that's just ridiculous otherwise. You can get a loan from SF for it, and you can also take a maintenance loan I believe. It's pretty much the minimum though because of your earnings.

The LA receives funding from the Treasury proportional to the 100 or so schools that they manage, and it is up to them to dish out the funding as they see fit. They can allocate more funding to needy schools than to schools with a plush intake, and they can choose to keep some funding for centrally provided shared services (anything from IT support to Educational Psychologists). LAs were also responsible for the school's performance, for ensuring there is enough school provision for their area, and for ensuring good staffing and governance.

Academies are not part of a Local Authority. They receive their funding directly from the Treasury, and are not compelled to cooperate with any other schools. Schools in posh areas are not compelled to balance their funding with needier neighbours. Monitoring schools' performance, governance, and staffing is the responsibility of the Department of Education in London. Academies can be founded in places where there is no need for extra school places, or in places where they might damage existing schools. LAs still have legal obligation to ensure that there are enough schools in their area, but are no longer able to build schools directly (as they are not responsible for academies and the DoE will not allow them to build comprehensives).

Furthermore, while conventional state schools are bound by a number of nationally consistent regulations, academies are not. Academies are free to not follow the national curriculum, and are free to pay staff anything they want unbound by pay scales (including paying experienced teachers less and ""superstar"" Heads much more, for example). They are also free to hire ""teachers"" without any formal training or qualifications, or to put unqualified Teaching Assistants in charge of taking classes or planning lessons.

Academies are also free to seek funding outside of normal channels, such as through corporate sponsorship or through monetising services to their students. Although academies are officially not allowed to run selective entry requirements, they are free to use their new fee-charging powers to discourage the ""wrong sort"" of students (for example, by charging large amounts for lunches, mandatory homework text books, or uniforms).

The only thing you have to worry about is setting a strong **personalised** network key. DO NOT use the default one on the router.

A long as you do that, you are more or less perfectly safe. The SSID is irrelevant, set this to whatever you like (e.g. I kept mine the same as default ""VirginMedia8456854"").

There are ways and additional details to make it slightly more secure but the difficulty to effectiveness/worthwhileness ratio for these is not really appropriate. Just stick with changing your network key.

In the future, please post to /r/TechSupport or similar subreddits.

1) Its a drop in the bucket for the number of houses we actually need. I think the last time I saw the figures for a university assignment I was part of, London alone needs to build *100k houses a year for a decade* just to deal with the backlog of demand and linearly modelled population growth.

UK wide, that figure jumps to [300,000 homes a year for a decade according to RIBA](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/300000-extra-homes-need-to-be-built-every-year-to-curb-housing-crisis-urges-report-8227467.html).

2) 

&gt;The homes would be exempt ""from a raft of taxes"", Mr Cameron said, such as the community infrastructure levy and a requirement to build social housing as part of any development.

So these houses are probably going to be for rich people (I mean, come on, they're going to be for rich people anyway because good fucking luck saving for a deposit on minimum wage, which comprises the majority of the UK workforce) since builders wouldnt have to build social housing as part of the development - they dont need to be affordable to the average man on the street.

On top of this, the removal of the infrastructure levy means that any development estate is going to be poorly served by local infrastructure (roads, electricity/water/gas grid/schools/hospitals/etc) that suddenly has to deal with a bunch of extra people.

3) 
&gt;Some building regulations - like the zero carbon homes standard - would also not apply to the new units.

Exemption from regulations on energy use and insulation, combined with that 20% reduction means houses will be built cheaply, and will piss energy through the walls and windows. In short, buyers would be getting a lemon.

4) As with help to buy, its a move that serves to affect the housing market in a negative way by pumping prices, with the added bonus that if the shit hits the fan like it did in 2008 then the government is on the hook for 20% of a houses' negative equity. The government (afaik) cant declare itself bankrupt and discharge its debts so that money has to come from other things.

5) This only helps 100,000 (or 200,000) people lucky enough to get on the scheme.

Sturridge to come on and score his usual off the bench goal, he is just excellent at spreading his goals over the season.

Yes, it would be fair for a CEO to pay 10,000X what the average employee makes if they've made the company profitable and the shareholders agree. 

&gt; Is it fair for a rich Western country to benefit from slave labour in a far flung foreign land?

Slave labour is internationally illegal. No one benefits from it and people found to be doing so would rightly be prosecuted and jailed. However, different countries have different labour laws and international companies can and should use whichever legal avenues enable them to return the most profit to their shareholders. 

&gt; The point of foreign aid and redistributive taxes is to try to do something to correct existing injustices.

No it is not. Foreign Aid is about improving the quality of life of the disenfranchised around the world. Redistributive taxes are a separate issue and are not about correcting existing injustices but about taking from each according to their ability and giving to each according to their need.

Is that right? Because the justification I heard we're using is ""A direct request has been made for our assistance.""

I could be wrong, but I don't recall the authorities from Somalia, Pakistan, Ukraine, Yemen, China or Colombia doing anything of the kind. I guess you know different though.

&gt;Bullshit. Is it Iraq State of Iraq and the Levant that we're after, or is it Abu Sayyaf, or Boko Haram, or...

Yeah, not being funny, but just because you haven't done your due diligence in finding out exactly what the scope of this operation is or what it's even meant to achieve or who exactly it is or will be directed against, doesn't mean the people who actually have responsibility haven't. Suffice to say the situation remains as it is before: People in a certain area have asked for assistance. Assistance will be rendered *in that area*. If and when we decide to broaden the scope of to encompass additional actions based on things that might come out of that, then we can talk about that.

And they will have come to that decision in the same way they've come to a decision on how to act with regards to every other group or situation on the planet you can come up with: Preclusion by diplomacy, military preemption, or various other methods of mitigation. You think because we've chosen to go military here that somehow every other terror group everywhere else on the planet requires the same action. Well, no bruv. For all these decisions - for over a decade now - there has been a way of determining what action to take based upon the hypothetical state of affairs that we'd like not to happen. An airstrike against a terror group in a sensitive region that directly impinges on our interests is one thing - unlimited war against scum in remote parts of China or deepest Africa does not necessarily qualify.

Until until you find a better way of doing things (or unlimited money and materiel), don't embarrass yourself by pretending you understand what's going on just because you can look up some colourful names on Google, or pretending you understand what any given action is designed to achieve (Who told you the purpose of these airstrikes is to wipe ISIS or whoever out?), or by making weak excuses for inaction ""It's hard and it'll take a long time, therefore fuck it"" (yeah, I think Parmenides came up with that one before you did, bro).",0,1411816410,null,0,false,0,cktuo8e,t3_2hjexp,t1_cktuo8e,t1_cktk0yr,null,1426800065,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Ignoring possible results it's also nice that Markovic is being given time to show his worth rather than simply being benched until we have crises out wide. He was pretty bad first half at Benfica (huge jump in league quality, much larger than Portugal-&gt;England one) and become their best player second half (despite the not too impressive numbers). Let's see what he can do under a manager that trusts him.


Sad about Sturridge, but Lambert has already shown promise, I really want to see him being given more time if we aren't working out. He has shown huge contributions when he came on against City/So'ton. Just needs to keep that positive impact and settle quickly.

Their philosophy was to teach you how to *ride*, now how to pass the test.

Now, here in Manchester, it's a different style completely.

Then the day of the mod 1 test is hour on the 500cc again, before the rest of the lesson on a 650cc. You then do a road ride to the test centre out Stockport way [through busy traffic areas, and a wide range of different conditions]

false,themanifoldcuriosity,null,null,"&gt; You can't just pick and choose who you fancy invading, it leaves you totally unable to justify your actions.

This is like saying doctors cannot pick and choose who they fancy treating - it leaves them unable to justify their actions. No mate. There is this thing called ""triage"", and the entire purpose is that it sets out principles and justifications that determine exactly who you can treat, in what order and why it has to be you.

As I said to a dude somewhere else in this thread: There is a set triage procedure we use to determine what actions to take against any given group of troublemakers. Adhering to that gives us whatever justification we need.

And to complicate things further, every decision we make has ramifications elsewhere: We're ostensibly trying to stop 1) Terror groups, 2) WMD proliferation and 3) Actual people getting killed all at once. And yet nothing we can do can deal with all three of those concerns at once. In fact, going after one, negatively impacts the other two. THAT is the consideration to weigh when deciding on air strikes, invasion, diplomacy, doing nothing etc etc - and something you clearly haven't thought about.

What if, as you suggest, we go balls deep on Saudi Arabia because their human rights are so shit. What is stopping every other nation with comparably dodgy human rights records (of which I could go on all day) from deciding ""Damn, America really fucked them up - we should probably get a bunch of guns and gunships and nukes to stop them doing the same thing to us in the future!"". Congratulations, now you have a dodgy state with a bunch of hardcore weapons ensuring that we can't do anything to help THEIR brutalised people. Well done.

And that is just one consideration. I doubt you've bothered to get up to speed on any of the other couple of ways we could try to help while simultaneously disadvantaging ourselves. Much easier to just say ""Fuck it, let's just buy some more nurses!""

&gt;We're almost certainly going to kill countless more civilians than ISIS will because our bombs are indiscriminate and only so accurate. We killed over half a million innocents in Iraq because Saddam was a bad guy and now look at Iraq.

You have literally no idea what you're talking about. You have no clue whatsoever about the accuracy of any given bomb. You're not even aware that the thousands that have been killed in Iraq over the last decade *have been through the actions of militants and other Iraqis, not us* (Jesus wept!). And perhaps worst of all, you can't even appreciate the irony of smugly proclaiming ""look at Iraq"" and the only reason we're in the mess right now is because people like you demanded that the only people in a position to protect Iraq from people like ISIS were brought home... because why should our troops die for them, right?

If you take measures to sharply bring down house prices you'll be unelectable for decades.

On occasion, this principle has been suspended; most notably in the 1930s when in Britain the National Government allowed its Liberal members to oppose the introduction of protective tariffs; and again when Harold Wilson allowed Cabinet members to campaign both for and against the 1975 referendum on whether the UK should remain in the European Economic Community. In 2003, Tony Blair allowed Clare Short to stay in the cabinet, despite her public opposition to the 2003 Iraq War. However, she later resigned.

It strikes me that there was originally a good case for prosecuting the parents for their actions if the state had wanted to. While their end goal was clearly admirable and their actions can perhaps be attributed to the difficult circumstances they were in, never the less their means were far from safe. My impression was the charges only got dropped because the government didn't particularly want to criminalize a pair of desperate, and perhaps slightly odd, parents... dragging the issue out in the media and courts, which may have been conflated into a *""why don't' we have a proton beam centre but the Czech republic does""* anti-NHS witch hunt.  

Ultimately a group of NHS doctors decided there was no benefit to proton beam therapy as his cancer had already spread too far. When the parents removed him from the hospital the police were involved and an international arrest warrant issued for the parents. That was ultimatley dropped and the state conceeded to let them pay for the proton beam therapy ONLY AFTER having the treatment (radiotherapy I think) that the NHS had recommended. 

Now we've gone further and have effectively incentivised this sort of behavior, by saying if you bend the rules far enough, and can rally social media to your cause then the state will just cave in - and not only accept your behavior, but also fund it.

If the bank decides that for whatever reason, they don't want to refund, your options to force them to are pretty limited.

Mastercard and Visa don't really talk to the general public - they'll refer you back to your bank. It's unlikely they'll even write them a rude letter demanding they process your refund; they certainly won't take your bank to court or refer them to the FCA if the bank refuse. And they're not about to cut the bank out of the payment processing system over a few pissed off customers. 

AIUI the FCA can look into it if the bank have broken the law, but if the bank have broken an agreement between themselves and Visa that's quite different. You're left with little choice but to jump up and down, shout and scream until such time as you run out of breath or you get through to someone who'll settle for a quiet life.

The absolute most you can do is say ""Your contract with Visa doesn't give you any choice in the matter"". Problem is, nobody outside the banks' head office knows exactly what those contracts say - the customer service reps certainly don't. They do, however, know what they're told they can and can't do.

That's not true with a credit card. With a credit card, it's much more cut and dried - they'll have a team dedicated to S75 refunds who know precisely what the rules say and are less likely to put up a big fight when they know you're in the right.",0,1411819912,null,0,false,0,cktva7m,t3_2hjspb,t1_cktva7m,t1_cktuxh9,null,1426799672,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

false,SirTwill,eng-devon,Plymouth,"I never got my A-levels, only an E in AS maths, and a U in AS Chemistry and Physics. I didn't want to retake the year so I signed up to a two year BTEC course in IT, got a D*D* (highest mark) which got me into uni.

I decided on my Uni because it was close to my family mainly and I really liked that the campus was literally the center of the city so I settled with Plymouth. I decided on my course, Computer Science, because it felt like a natural progression from IT BETC. Although most of my friends from the BTEC went and did computing I prefered the more theory and AI based stuff that came with Computer Science.

In my first year I studied a lot, signed up to the Gaming, Robotics and the Computing Socities and spent a lot of time socialising with them and getting my foot int he door as to say. This way when I had less time to socialise in my second year I had already done the networking with people on the years above me and could easily ask for advice. On top of that it got me a nice large friend group really quickly. At the end of my first year I ran for treasurer of the Computing Soc and got the position.

During my second year I helped run the Computer Soc as my role as tresasurer demanded and studied a lot, many nights in the library till 4am.

YES, YES, YES. You most certianly can apply for a placements in your second year as long as your course has a ""Sandwich"" equivelent. The Sandwich version of your course allows you to take a year out of uni at a work placement whilst still be a registered student and still getting some (very little) financial support from Student finance, you will also need to still pay £900 of tution fees for the year you work. I got a placement with Plymouth City Council in their IT Department and I'm going to do a little bit of everything (I'm currenlty on the support desk atm, but they are going to move me around to the different departments slowly through the year) and after speaking to the right people I found out they offer a full time job to pretty much all of the students that work with them once they graduate so I'm pretty much already sorted for then.

If there is anything I'd wish I'd considered before I started it would be to not go into my overdraft. If you get the full SF payment over the year (~£7.2K) and you pay about £80 a week rent you DON'T need an overdraft. I fucking stupid with my money and I'm going to be using money from my placement to pay it off.

Is it worth it? I'd say so, but my degree is theory heavy and not so easily self taught as graphical design.

false,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"5 minutes before the European elections, the party still officially supported a flat tax rate. You have high ranking members like Paul Nuttall (deputy leader, had posts on his blog supporting more privatisation) and Roger Helmer (called NHS a '60 year mistake' and praised the American system), who have been in the party for years and still hold positions of influence, advocating privatisation. You have other members like David Coburn, a self proclaimed libertarian, who would also support privatisation of the NHS. The party somehow suggest absolutely slashing taxes, including inheritance tax and corporation tax, yet will apparently be able to both afford this and putting more funding into the NHS by leaving the EU and stopping foreign aid. 

Unless all these MEPs suddenly radically changed their views, and got behind the NHS and higher taxes for it, I'm more inclined to believe they are simply being populist, and understand if they want to get the working class vote they can't stand on libertarian policies. They know they won't get a majority, or even into a position of serious power, so know they can say whatever populist rhetoric they want, and blame the other parties if it isn't followed through.

 It seems ludicrous that people are so sceptical of Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dem, but seem perfectly willing to accept everything UKIP say at face value (except if what they say doesn't make UKIP look good, in which case they'll ignore it).

But *everyone* gets a job because they want to be paid. It's not like its charity work; teaching is a full time job. While teachers typically get into teaching because they have some appreciation for the type of work that they do, that doesn't mean they'd do it if they didn't have to get a job like everyone else to begin with. Teachers are human, after all. 

Also, lots of people who could be good (or are good) at teaching can be good at many other professions as well, as the interpersonal, communication and planning skills that one needs to be a good teacher cross over to many other career paths. So many people who *could* be excellent teachers choose jobs where those skills are better rewarded.

- A lot of senior politicians are paedophiles and needed to hide evidence
- Thomas hamilton was a paedophile and needed to hide evidence
- Political parties needed to ban are least some forms of guns to meet their promises

So it was arranged that thomas hamilton would go into a class full of abused children and execute specific children. Some even say the politicians gave him his guns since he was actually denied them before, but who knows since the records were probably burned. Once this was done the political parties now had reason to ban handguns, so they could meet their promises! Yay!

But unfortunately this happiness could not last, because alas they needed a constant supply of victims to fulfil their addiction and this drew attention.
The CIA noticed that high level politicians in the party in power at the time were paedophiles and informed the president. The prime minister has a choice, become the slave of the USA or face the public humiliation and arrest of his political party and complete loss of career. He chose slavery.

false,Boatus,eng-essex,Colchester,"I think you a few of you need to understand the way the system works before you make remarks about something you've obviously misunderstood. You have come across as a little foolish at best.

I'm a Brit but I live out in Slovakia and I've been waiting for comments like some of these to hit my facebook feed. Still, I'll explain what's going on quickly as the article fudges it. 

Slovakia and the Czech republic aren't asking for the UK to pay JSA (Job seekers allowance) to their citizens. Instead, they are asking for the NI (National Insurance) contributions that they paid while their citizens worked in the UK. If you look at your payslips or e-payslips for those that don't know we pay two lots of tax, NI and our 'normal taxes' (for Police, medical services, parliament to award itself etc). 

The NI is designed to pay for those that can't work or are unemployed and it all goes into a kitty that's then split up. If you were in the UK it would be JSA. These citizens have been paying the NI but aren't getting anything from it because they're citizens of another country and are no longer residents. Like all other insurance schemes, if you don't pay your dues you don't get anything back (a bit simplified but the principle is there). So what in effect the Czech and Slovak governments are asking for are the 'subs' from it's citizens so it can use them to pay their equivalent of JSA.

There's a lot of comments about UKIP in here but the only reason they get any attention is they go out to confuse, gloss over facts and don't explain. I only hope this comment helps some see through their bullshit and Sabre rattling. I know of another political party that did the same thing a few years back.

For religious people, society's ethics should be structured around revealed truths and divine commandments.

For secular humanists, society should determine a set of inviolable human rights, place these above the the rights and powers of any individual nation or political party, and attempt to give each human being on the planet protection from their own rulers by holding everyone accountable to human rights courts.

But for Theresa May and Benito Mussolini, rights are not the inviolable birthright of each human being.

But seriously: yes, NAT isn't a firewall. Nor is NAPT, which is what you're probably talking about (unless you'd argue that most homes have multiple public IP addresses, which seems to me to be far less likely than that they have a hardware firewall!). However, NAPT defaults tend to be to drop all inbound traffic, which - for a home user - meets a large part of their firewall needs and is (usually) far safer than allowing traffic on all ports to be routed through to a computer on the network.",0,1411825151,null,0,false,0,cktwiny,t3_2hlqp6,t1_cktwiny,t1_cktuzc2,null,1426799042,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

But humans are generally poor judges of fast developing situations. You hear footsteps approaching fast behind you in the dark.. is it a threat? We surely don't want people to shoot first, ask questions later in that situation.

Now look at some of the bad cases. You know those dickheads on every estate who keep an unpleasant dog or two? Those guys will start keeping guns now. People who feel threatened by social workers worried about their kids or policemen responding to reports of a domestic incident - those people will have guns ready for when there's a knock on the door. Mothers who aren't capable of cooking their kids a hot meal - they'll be the people we count on not to leave the family Glock on the bed with the safety off.

We would be likely to see our gun-related homicide rate move from its current level of 0.04 per 100 000 citizens to something close to 3 per 100 000 which is the rate in the USA.

-Henderson was amazing. Especially in the first half.  Lallana was also great but needs to practice his corners.

- Markovic seems to be playing with zero confidence or passion (the same can be said for Mignolet).

- I feel like Balotelli keeps making the wrong decisions. Shoots when he should pass, tries to get the ball under control when he should pull the trigger immediately.

We’re still not creating enough chances. It’s especially disappointing that we barely crate anything after we go 1-0 up and Everton needs to push forward.

Meanwhile, we have an excellent example of what happens when money is splashed around - Digital Region in South Yorkshire - an attempt to build an FTTC network. It never really had great traction because of the no-name ISPs that used it (the likes of TalkTalk and Sky didn't touch it), it was a money pit from the start, and it eventually went bust and has since closed down. Those people not fortunate enough to have a BT FTTC cabinet serving them are now back on ADSL.

At least some big ISPs are involved in this project, but I still think it is rather dubious, and ultimately will never get the breadth BT enjoys. If we actually thought about this as a country, we could have gone down the Australian NBN approach and had a single, government owned network that everyone could use and everyone would be connected to.

false,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; That depends on the cost and time required compared to the results of running fibre to the distribution point rather than completely into the home.

Not that much different compared to copper I'd imagine.

&gt; There's also no reason we can't have both, but if this gets us half a gig at 100m with significantly lower costs than FTTP it sounds like a good solution. 

But every time we do something like FTTC, FTTdp, it's yet another round of money being used for something that is pretty dead-end. How many ""significantly lower cost"" projects do we have to do before we finally just do FTTP? How much money will we have burnt on masses of redundant FTTC/FTTdp hardware? There's also the question of money saved on being able to decommission copper.

&gt; And how much is running that final bit going to cost? It's not like there's one distribution point per home.

My understanding of BT's network is that the distribution point is the box on top of a pole - so you're asking for most/all poles to have fibre, power, battery backup and an expensive DSLAM plonked on top. This isn't cheap, and the ongoing costs are likely to be higher than FTTP (which uses a passive splitter, that is maintenance free for the most part). Just plonk a splitter onto the fibre you'll be running anyway and run cables into homes.

Around here everyone is on overhead wiring. I honestly can't see the massive cost advantages for FTTdp. There will definitely be instances where FTTdp is cheaper and great to use, but I hope this doesn't mean BT will use it everywhere.

&gt; (and perhaps even more so if the FTTC work covers a lot of the same work).

My understanding is that FTTC has meant that the fibre now extends to street level, but you'll still be digging up to put fibre up to the poles from there. This is the challenging and expensive bit, not stringing it across the road. You're paying most of the cost of FTTP but getting none of the benefit.

Your quote is a bit naff. It's from a company whose business is building Gfast chips. Of course they're going to say FTTP is expensive, they want people buying Gfast hardware with their chips!",0,1411826451,null,0,1411827374,0,cktwwmk,t3_2hip2p,t1_cktwwmk,t1_ckttlei,null,1426798764,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

As something that was such an integral part of how we played last year, not having as much up top has really become an issue for us. Sturridge provides that and we missed him dearly today, running into the channels and creating space/opportunities for Ste/Lal/Mar.

What really winds me up these days is that I expect us to have to do something the hard way, all the time. We were the better side today and had chance after chance to close out the game, but didn't because our players seem incapable of creating that killer pass or getting the ball into the areas it needs to be. Once again, it's come back to bite us on the arse. Again.


Lallana/Moreno excellent today, full of purpose and direct running which made them a real threat throughout. Feel sorry for the defence, they couldn't have worked harder today, only to be let down by a stroke of magic. People calling for Mignolet after that need to have a hard look at themselves, don't think any keeper in the world would have saved that, he hit it so sweetly.

We played a much better game today than we did in the last two, Aston Villa and West Ham, and I'm hoping we see positive results from here on out.

Jags and Stones have to be 100% first choice starters now, just 1 goal from a set piece that neither could stop in the 2 games they've started together.

Didn't think Hibbo was too bad either he was actually stable enough defence wise but Browning was great when he came on and I'd say through this baptism of fire he has cemented his place as 2nd choice RB.

Baines had another Bainesy game except set pieces weren't the best today.

McCarthy looked solid enough as usual. Barry I felt should've been taken off at half time not because he was bad or anything but we knew he couldn't play as usual after being booked so early. Thought it was very unfair on Besic to be taken off, thought he deserved the 90 in my opinion very good from him. 

Naisy done well today in his usual role of being an annoyance to their defence and he did his job well maybe his decision making wasn't the greatest but that's it really. Really disappointed about Kev, key player for us so far probably the best behind Naisy so far. Hopefully it won't be too long out for him because we'll miss him. McGeady was frustrating at times for both Liverpool and me to watch. I rate him as the second best winger at the club but he has to find a good consistency. Still believe he's going to have a big part this season especially now Kev is sidelined.

My only real negative from the game is Rom. I don't think he was good enough today now at all ( I know he was playing slightly out of position) he couldn't do many basics right at all from passing and running with the ball. He was very wasteful and didn't seem to give 100%. Is he fully fit yet I honestly don't know. I think if he got a few games behind Eto'o on the bench it would do him and the team best. Especially if he's not fit yet no point pushing him and pushing when he's not yet able and when we have a perfectly capable replacement for him until he regains fitness.",0,1411827198,null,0,false,0,cktx4q5,t3_2hm1gg,t1_cktx4q5,t3_2hm1gg,null,1426798578,7,false,Everton,t5_2qpfg,7

And Balotelli has performed well IMO.

It's not about what individuals are doing or even little snippets of interplay between them. Some of that looks promising. But the entire team looks aimless in attack and with our defence that's an awful combination.

I'd be happy to just roll with it and give Brendan time if he was really trying out different things. But, except for West Ham which is an older problem that occurs when Lucas and Gerrard play together, we've mostly played with 1 up front and it just doesn't work.

I still think BR's signings have been good and, given time, will develop and improve. Our full backs are exceptionally talented, in particular Moreno, who will go on to be something of a cult figure I believe. He reminds me of John Arne Riise who was loved so think he'll do well. MB, AL, DL and JM have all looked good at times and are the sort of players that BR likes to work with. His record of improving players and adapting them to his styles is certainly second to none, that's for sure. Only player i'm concerned about is Lambert, who I'm not sure will be there for long and will be more of a cameo star, if anything.

Cool, it'd be awesome to see your studies on that then.

&gt; You're paying most of the cost of FTTP but getting none of the benefit.

Numbers would be handy.

&gt; How many ""significantly lower cost"" projects do we have to do before we finally just do FTTP?

Probably as many as it takes before the final cost is acceptable to people. 

&gt; I honestly can't see the massive cost advantages for FTTdp.

Well it's going to be important to know how many people are connected to each distribution point, and the cost per distribution point vs the cost of running to each house. It will also vary from region to region, and it's important to know if this gets us closer (i.e. how much is wasted doing this, then doing FTTP later vs doing it right now). 

&gt; Your quote is a bit naff. It's from a company whose business is building Gfast chips. Of course they're going to say FTTP is expensive, they want people buying Gfast hardware with their chips!

At least it's something. Without anything else, all we're going from is you saying ""Oh well I think it'd cost about the same"". Alcatel Lucent say savings of up to 25%, but then I don't think that includes work already done for FTTC, which would suggest much more than 25%.

&gt; That's wrong. If you have access to the WPA key, you can sniff others' data on that network.

No you cant, you cant decrypt traffic with a WPA key


TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)   
    The RC4 stream cipher is used with a 128-bit per-packet key, meaning that it dynamically generates a new key for each packet. Used by WPA.


CCMP (Counter Cipher Mode with block chaining message authentication code Protocol)   
    An AES-based encryption mechanism that is stronger than TKIP. Used by WPA2. Among informal names are ""AES"" and ""AES-CCMP"". According to the 802.11n specification, this encryption protocol must be used to achieve the fast 802.11n high bitrate schemes, though not all implementations enforce this.[29] Otherwise, the data rate will not exceed 54 MBit/s. 

&gt;I think you're getting muddled with the inherent weakness of WEP encryption, that it's trivially easy for somebody to crack and access the data without the key?

What?

You crack the key, which is fairly easy due to flaws in the encryption.

You'd need a Saddam Hussein-level grip on the country to legalise hard drugs and have it actually work in terms of preventing criminal activity and costs.

Even in a world of legalisation these people would still be prosecuted and sent to prison, as they'd be screwing the government out of tax money.

Making addictive hard drugs legal (and therefore marketable on a large scale) isn't likely to turn out too well for society either for rather obvious reasons. I doubt many politicians would want to face another industry as large and morally bankrupt as the tobacco industry at the height of its power, it would just make regulating it an absolute nightmare politically. Cannabis growing meanwhile is suited towards small and medium sized businesses, that industry would have about as much political lobbying power as the carrot industry, and so regulating Cannabis would be fairly easy politically.

In general it comes down to control, once you understand how each brake effects your bike in different ways you can use them in different scenarios to have a more controlled stop. Although there are general rules for this, specifics vary from bike to bike. My VFR took longer to get used to because it has linked brakes, the rear brake also engages the front break (Albeit less than using the front brake myself).

Plus, personally I prefer the idea of only being able to lock up one wheel rather than two. We only have small contact points and if both of my brakes were on one control, locking a wheel up would most likely lock both and guarantee a crash, whereas with two controls I can continue to decrease my speed while freeing the locked wheel and then continuing to brake.

That's interesting. When my almost new 1200 GS was stolen in Camden a couple of years ago I got a very detailed letter from the police explaining why they couldn't use CCTV (lots of words that basically added up to 'we're too busy'). 

When I called them back to as what they were doing about my bike I was told, in a round about way, pretty much nothing. They were more than happy to expedite the police report for my insurance claim, but that was the start and end of it.

Are there different policies for different parts of London? Any tips for getting the police to take stolen/damaged bikes more seriously?

And don't get me started on the commentators - of course you all know that already.

We had chances late on to win the game 3-2, but as usual the ref and linos were against us from the start. We showed our typical lack of luck as well with Shrek scoring with a flying shin and RVP with his weak foot. We gave the captain's band to Song, who single-handedly caused their second goal and should never have had it to begin with, too. Where was Noble? Why was Nolan brought on when we've seen we're better without him? Yes, he scored what should have been our second, but any of the three on the end of that cross could have got to it.

And then the linesman blows for full time whilst we're standing outside of their box with everyone forward. Fine decision, Lee Mason, you fucking bellend.

It would make politicians less representative to a local electorate, less in touch with the needs of people of disparate areas of the United Kingdom and much harder to dislodge unpopular politicians from Parliament. It is fair and right that different areas of the people can elect the politician that represents the majority of people from that area. That is local, democratic and accountable. Proportional Representation might seem fairer at a cursory level in that 24.4% of the votes equals 24.4% of the seats, but the reality of such a system is complete power in the hands of the Westminster party elites in deciding who would govern us. There is almost no way the public can unseat a Government and absolutely no way the public can unseat a poltician.

AV was not a miserable fudge. It is the best electoral system possible, especially coupled with a mechanism to recall MPs by petition and a system of primaries so that local people could directly choose local candidates.",0,1411834502,null,0,false,0,cktzs3x,t3_2hm5ia,t1_cktzs3x,t1_cktywsi,null,1426797130,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Although, as I said, the vast majority of the tax they pay they can't request. I've just checked my payslip from the summer when I was at home from uni and worked for about £7.50 an hour. So still technically in the 'minimum wage' bracket (Which I think is about up to £8.00/hour). When I was emergency taxed I paid £32.60 in income tax for a week and £1.27 in NI. The Slovak and Czech governments are requesting the £1.27 part of the tax, that 30 odd quid they can't touch.

At the time, these shootings were *highly* contentious, and was front page news for weeks on end. The IRA suspects didn't have an assembled bomb, and there was no remote control detonator to go for, the authorities likely knew this because they apparently had the suspects followed right through Spain (at least, that was what government ministers initially claimed to Parliament; later on, they changed their story once people pointed out the consequences, to one where they apparently lost the squad somewhere in Spain - but still they didn't think to arrest the terrorists at the border, instead of letting them into Gibraltar to be killed) and that the description of events by the SAS members who killed them was disputed point blank by a number of eye witnesses, including the pathologist who examined the bodies. Having people killed in dodgy circumstances like these definitely warrants looking into.

This was by no means the only incident around these times that warranted looking into; there were a number of other cases, related to Northern Ireland which suggested something like a policy of tacitly allowing 'death squad' type assassinations was in effect.

These guys, particularly Party General Eoin O'Duffy supported Franco and were instrumental in keeping Ireland out of WWII and in building links with Nazi Germany. 

What are you talking about? The blueshirts had no influence whatsoever over De valera, in fact Dev Dismissed O'Duffy from his position of Police Commisioner as soon as he was Elected, O'Duffy in his quest for power took over the ACA, turning them into the Blueshirts ,the Neutrality position had nothing to do with them, where you picked up that bizarre little factoid is beyond me.

The quasi Fascist grouping (note the quasi, as they where described in the [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Blueshirts-Maurice-Manning/dp/0717140091/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=) you linked to) where a bizarre corporatist catholic outfit filled with pro-treaty freestaters with delusions of grandeur, they where regularly attacked by the [IRA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueshirts#History). The Blueshirts where banned outright in 1933. There Foray into Spain was a farce, they never even saw action and came home in disarray, Ending the pompous little fuckwit O'Duffy's Political Career. The subsequent Development of Fine Gael, which was a Centre Right party that dropped all pretense of its ridiculous quasi fascistic leanings.

They only came into any power within a Coalition Government which included the Labour Party, Clann na Poblachta, Clann na Talmhan and the National Labour Party in [1948-1951](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_13th_D%C3%A1il).

I also recommend spending everything on the 123 credit card to get e.g. 3% off your fuel - but make sure you set up a Direct Debit to pay it off in *full* automatically every month.

Once you've done that, look into opening a First Direct 6% (4.8% after tax) regular saver, which needs another current account. By then you'll think opening new accounts isn't hard, so go for 2 x TSB 5% accounts next. Anyway, that'll keep you occupied for now making your money work harder for you.

Yes, the USS is very good, just note that it's a ""final salary"" scheme (not ""defined contribution"") - this is traditionally a good thing since you expect your salary to rise over time. Especially so, given your age, you're likely to move jobs before you retire.

So if they were to get their way and the ECHR was done away with technically all those rights will still remain but will be determined by British politics in the future rather than international politics.

I do believe human rights should be one of the ""big picture"" policies that apply to everyone equally across all countries and really do hope that for that reason we continue to share the same human rights as our brothers and sisters across the channel because while our cultures are different along with our languages we are all still human and we should look out for each other at the very least for our shared human rights, human rights that we all came together to agree on after WW2 so we could do our best to avoid any shit like that ever happening again even on a small scale.

If we do leave Europe and/or the ECHR we won't end up loosing everything you list above, but it means that our government alone can determine what human rights are rather than a larger multi-cultural and multi-national group.

- Hibbo was OK. Not bad but obviously would be a liability against pacey widemen. But again who wouldn't be troubled by Sterling? But obviously Browning should be given a run when Seamus is out. Ty's touches looked a bit heavy but that kid was fast. Probably even faster than Seamus.


- Bainesy wasn't bad either, but his corner kicks haven't been good for a while now. Rarely got past the first man, which is not acceptable really.


- Jags and Stonesy look really solid and should be the go-to pairing from now on. And obviously that goal. Talk about having a dream derby.


- Barry was hindered all game by the early yellow. Otherwise had a decent game. James was his usual self again, being an engine and was doing all the dirty work in the midfield. Besic has shown why he's so highly rated and why he hasn't gotten too much play time yet. Great talent but still quite raw at this point. 


- Rom shouldn't be on the wing. His dribbling while he was running isn't bad, but he's not gonna use tricks and feints to get past any good defenders. Put him back at the 9 please.


- Naisy made some bad decisions but can't fault him for his efforts and running. What a pest and he's out pest. Love him.


- Gutted for Kev, but seems like a tradeoff for being an explosive player with the hammy injuries once in a while. McGeady needs to just run at players once in a while and stop relying on tricks alone.


What a game. We never gave up and we never stopped asking questions. We have young players who can challenge the starting spots and wily vets who will provide experience. I hope this game serves as a springboard to kickstart our season.

Without knowing how many doctors looked at this thought 'fuck the parents might have a point', could be why the NHS decided to cover this.

It may not even be a purely home trained issue, just that Dr's working for the NHS who have came from abroad have a qualification that is easier to acquire but in reality and in treating people can fall short.

* Lamela pls that clearance hurts :(

* Michael Oliver did fine in terms of big decisions, but my lord did he give some soft yellows. 6 for spurs and while I don't remember Lamela's, the only one that I remember being deserved was Mason's. A yellow for shushing the crowd? Seriously? A yellow for Danny Rose coming off too early or wasting time? Come on...

* Adebayor looked dead (effort level: 8/10, tepid jog) for almost the entire second half. After 1-0, I was begging to see a sub so we could get some kind of tempo or counter-attack back instead of sitting back all the time and watching Ade lightly jog around.

false,unnatural_rights,num23,,"Couple of thoughts:

* Hard fought by our boys, and a deserved point.  Overall it was a frustrating game but we weren't universally embarrassing which happens too often.

* Adebayor needs to sit on the bench.  For, like, a month.  Let him play in Europe or as a sub.  But for the *love of God* give Soldado some fucking playing time.  Ade was silent most of the match and when he did make himself heard it was with the ""pfffft"" of a wet fart.  Soldado has better communication with Lamela (and with both Eriksen and Lamela when they play together), and deserves to be given a *chance*, at least, to prove himself.  The way things are going right now I'm worried we're going to kill his career dead, and he doesn't deserve that.

* Eriksen and Lamela's communication needs work.  The rotational AM lineup only works if everyone remembers to rotate; too often I saw Lamela crowding up into Eriksen's space, which left gaps in our attack and even led to us being dispossessed a few times.  If Eriksen isn't getting out of the way, *don't cut inside*.  If Lamela's coming in, run forward so that the play can continue.  But having them both occupy the same physical space is just a recipe for unforced errors in our play.

* Chadli had a few defensive stumbles but sweet Jesus when that man gets a goal he *gets a fucking goal*.  I'm up, I'm down, I'm talking shit, I'm praising the heavens.  He's like a personification of Spursiness.  Also, that card was bullshit.

* In fact, most of these cards were bullshit.  NINE yellows in a single match, for fuck's sake.

* Ryan Mason carried himself well today.  I look forward to seeing more of the same from him.

* Kaboul, baby, I've dumped on you before.  I still might not be certain you're the best possible captain we could have appointed.  But you did a fantastic fucking job and I'm proud to have you on my team.  THAT is passion.

false,ShadowOfTheWasp,null,null,"there was a helpful [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/bristol/comments/2epkov/good_tattoo_artist/) a few weeks ago that you might get a few useful recommendations from. 

You also asked for general tips so I'll add that it's important to find an artist that you feel comfortable with and can do the work in the style you want. The latter is easy enough, check their portfolio photos online and/or ask to see their book of photos in the tattoo shop, all decent tattooists have a book in the shop, it's there so you can see what they can do and are proud of. If the book is full of tribal blackwork and you're looking for a colour photo-realistic portrait then you'll be able to see they don't do that usually, find someone who does.

As for being comfortable with them as a person, that might be a bit of a luxury but I've found that the best tattooists are friendly and make you feel like your design input matters, or at the least is taken into consideration. Conversely, some tattooists are just pricks that just want to do it their way, don't listen, don't care and the customer possibly ends up with a regretful tattoo, they're just grumps with ego problems.  So if you can (tattooists are often very busy and unable to chat with everyone that's 'just enquiring') have a quick chat and see if they do the sort of work you want, are enthusiastic about doing it, and aren't a prick - you'll be able to tell.

Other than that, the best artists are booked up months in advance so be prepared for that, it's not unusual to find someone and the next free slot they have is over six months ahead. Might not be an issue for a small tattoo if you're lucky though, cancellations can open up gaps in their schedules.

Ok Hands up from the start here. I am a ‘conspiracy theorist’, I choose to define that term as follows

I question the statements of known liars. 

Now that is out in the open I shall continue. Here is the relevant part of DC's speech

&gt;""To defeat Isil - and organisations like it - we must defeat this ideology in all its forms.

&gt;As evidence emerges about the backgrounds of those convicted of terrorist offences, it is clear that many of them were initially influenced by preachers who claim not to encourage violence, but whose world view can be used as a justification for it.

&gt;The peddling of lies: that 9/11 was a Jewish plot and the 7/7 London attacks were staged.""

 The terminology here is very vague and far reaching

Preacher: This could be anyone, although normally associated with religion. I have heard people say Bill Hicks was a preacher. Should Bill Hicks be locked up for telling 'jokes' with truth intertwined in them?

Peddling of lies?: What does this even mean? Let’s take the abuse scandal as an example. The BBC says there is no child abuse, many victims and journalists investigate and say yes there is abuse. The BBC would call them liars so then would they be caught up in this massive net and locked away?

I would say DC’s speech is ground work for thought crime. There I said a 1984 term…..wish I never read that book so I could join you guys laughing at all the nutters who believe the world is going to down the gutter.

The UK pays interest on its outstanding bonds, and at some point each bond 'matures', and the full principal is then owed back to the entity with the bond. This is kind of equivalent to you having an 'interest-only' mortgage on your house, and you suddenly owe the band the full amount you borrowed.

The standard approach then is just to issue a new bond to cover the value of the old bond. As long as your borrowing costs are low, it's not really an issue. The problems start when your borrowing costs go up, or if people literally stop buying your bonds, like what has happened with certain nations in the past few years (Argentina, Greece, Venezuela, even Germany had some failed auctions a few years back)

It's not really that useful to try and compare personal debt with the debt obligations of nations though, as technically a nation like the UK should never ever default because we can literally print the money to pay off our debts (most of the bonds are denominated in GBP).

I am an admissions representative for Cambridge University and to give one example where privately educated people and people who attend grammar schools had a massive advantage is Maths.

A condition of entry to study maths at Cambridge is passing the STEP exam (to give you some idea of how hard this is, just shy of half of all applicants that are given Cambridge offers fail this exam and thus don't get a place). Privately educated students will get STEP coaching which massively helps for this sort of exam (you may be a complete genius but to pass this exam you need to know how to precisely format a mathematical proof, something which requires teaching and lots of feedback on your attempts to get right).

Until recently, someone in a regular comprehensive would have been massively disadvantaged because they would have not received the help that is available in a private school and to a lesser but still substantial extent in most grammar schools. To combat this Cambridge now run easter STEP camps for students that don't go to grammar or private schools to give them every chance of fulfilling their potential.

I am a big believer in access (as is the university) which is why I give up a not insignificant amount of my time going to state schools and giving talks to try and give people the help and advice that I know their peers in private and grammar schools are getting.

Whilst it is certainly true that someone in a state school can excel and can get into a top University with all things being equal they are disadvantaged  by the fact they are in a state school. You only need to look at the admissions statistics for the top universities to see this is true - a grossly disproportionate number of successful applicants are from private schools and unless you attribute intelligence to parents wealth this can only be from the extra support they get. Grammar schools are accessible to all bright children, regardless of background and I believe that they are instrumental in allowing many gifted children from unprivileged backgrounds to reach their full potential. 

**TL;DR**

&gt;You're utterly deluded if you believe that those not in grammar schools are intrinsically less able to excel.

If you had two identical, gifted people with ambitions to study at Cambridge and one went to study at a state comprehensive and the other at a grammar school, whilst it is entirely possible (maybe even probable) that both will get in to Cambridge it is more likely that the grammar school student will get in whilst the state school student won't rather than the other way around. This is simply down to the extra coaching (interview coaching, STEP coaching, better academic reference etc.). I'm not entirely sure how I'm meant to interpret ""those not in grammar schools are intrinsically less able to excel"" but if you interpret this paragraph to be contradictory to your statement then I guess I am in your opinion ""utterly deluded"" and you are in my opinion ""utterly deluded"".",0,1411851258,null,0,1411851745,0,cku6vs9,t3_2hifjs,t1_cku6vs9,t1_cku3eza,null,1426793746,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I'm not arguing about the current implementation of inheritance tax and whether it's effective, I'm arguing the idea that inheritance tax is the best &amp; easiest way to break down social immobility in this country.  

It's a bit perverse that we're taking the feelings of dead people into account to argue that inheritance shouldn't be taxed when the government could use the money to actually help living people, don't you think?  
You say that it's only fair that parents shouldn't be taxed for leaving something to their children to give them the best start in life? Well presumably they'd have given the best start in life when they were still alive (fancy schools, holidays etc.), so it's not as if you're forcing these people's children into poverty by taking away their inheritance.  
The idea of a meritocracy and not taxing inheritance don't go together - receivers of inheritance are getting something for nothing.  
Poorer people are constantly priced out of getting decent jobs, a healthy inheritance can pay for your living costs for years while you can volunteer and get experience in an industry which a less wealthy person couldn't, ensuring the rich still get the best opportunities.  
Want to start a business? If you're poor, lol good luck. No problem for you if you've got a healthy inheritance though, you can afford to take the risk. Even if you lose it all, you're back where you were when you started, it's win/draw.  
Fancy getting real power? Use your inheritance money to fund your political campaign! 

The point I'm ultimately trying to make is this: Think of Rawls's thought experiment about how you would design a society if you had a 'veil of ignorance' - you were going to live in this society, but you had no idea in what position you would be in (i.e. you could be royalty or a pleb or anywhere in between).

I think this Doctor definitely has feelings for Clara but being stuck in an old body he's struggling with them not being reciprocated, after how easily Rose and Martha (and Jack tehe) fell for him, and how Amy chose Rory. So that's why it's hard for him to deal with Clara preferring Pink. It hit me right in the feels because The Doctor is so much cooler than Pink will ever be, backflips and all.


It made me really dislike him. He just decided he knew who the Doctor was within a few minutes of meeting him.


Clara knows the Doctor has insane regret for his part in the Time War and what he did so it is not cool that she just left her boyfriend walk over 12 and make him feel like shit. Clara is not a good friend for letting Pink do that.


Pink's comparison to the Doctor being every other officer or soldier, when he has the fate of entire species in his hands. It makes me hate Pink, because Pink and 12 are in similar situations with regards to past war activity so Pink should be able to empathise with him, but he just acts like a huge dick to 12.

This is factually incorrect. The ECHR stands for the European Court/Convention of/on Human Rights. The European Court of Human Rights its pan-national. It is completely independent of British Politics. When the ECHR was first ratified the governing body of it (the judges) didn't manage it infer half of the handing downs it has now, including prisoners getting votes. 

The ECHR has overstretched on its original purpose. Some of the rulings we see now are utterly bizarre and deviate heavily from original interpretations by judicial precedent. 

Do not think me as someone who disregards Human Rights. I have every intention of pursuing Human Rights law at the end of my Law degree. However, it is vital to distinguish between what are most defiantly rights and what most defiantly are not. The simple matter is that the HRA is ill equipped to protect rights in the 21st century. The document the HRA was based off was written shortly after WWII. That is a *very* long time ago and a lot of the issues that exist today would not have been issues at the time. 

Let me give you a classic example: only years after the HRA was introduced as law in the UK the most atrocious affronts to liberty happened under Blair. Whilst the HRA was able to nullify a number of the more extreme steps, the simply fact is that the HRA was ill-equipped to protect citizens from human rights abuses to the fullest. Why? Because international terrorism did not exist as it does today when the HRA was formed. The sort of things that need to exist to protect citizens in the 21st century are simply not covered enough in the HRA. 

So my argument for you is two-fold: (1) that the politics of the UK have 0 effect on the ECHR which was a awesomely funny claim to make given the nature of the ECHR's legal relationship to the UK. And (2) that ECHR does not do exactly what it was intended for. That is not because it was poorly authored or wasn't far-reaching enough. It is simply because it did not have the foresight necessary to predict 21st century problems (and it could not be expected to).

From the Labour viewpoint it's great because there will be fewer Tories to keep them out.

From the Tory viewpoint it's not too bad because although a by-election will take place come the general election they will have a more Tory-centric candidate to contest the vote.

From the UKIP viewpoint they've picked off another seat, but the people that voted Tory because, well, Tory, might not be so inclined to vote for a turncoat next year. Sure, it's a short term incursion but there's a lot of work to do to keep the momentum up.

From the Lib Dem and Green perspective it probably wouldn't make much difference.

To the undecided (neolib) voter it probably adds to their inner turmoil: would it be better to vote for the Tories or UKIP, geez, I dunno... probably UKIP.

To the undecided (left-leaning) voter it will probably shift them more towards UKIP.

The biggest gain locally will probably be Labour due to the split caused by UKIP. UKIP's gain will most likely be short term because the British people are at heart conservative (small ""c"").

What did ISIS do when it started this latest offensive? The first thing they did was start killing Shia soldiers left right and centre. Why? Every Iraqi commentator I saw said it was to start stirring the sectarian tensions in Iraq. Turn this into a Sunni vs. Shia thing and get the holy war started. They wanted the Shias to start arming and fighting so they could get Iraqi sunnis who don't like ISIS to see the situation as sunni vs shia and fall into line, conveniently, behind ISIS.

Now they are doing this same thing on a different scale with the west. If they can stir up shit enough to goad NATO into attacking them full on then they can try and push this as Islam vs. the west, draw the line on the sand and force people to start taking sides for a big international holy war. They want to radicalise other muslims and force them into action towards ISIS's own goals.

Now, I'm all for defending these innocent cultures from ISIS's onslaught. I've been following the Kurdish situation long before reddit started loving the Kurds. I've been bringing them up as a cause worth supporting back when no one would listen to me. I was one of the earliest adopters of the Kurdish flair on /r/syriancivilwar. And I've been watching in horror at what is unfolding near Kobani. But I still think Western Intervention can to little but give some short term breathing space for those already fighting ISIS.

Boots on the ground is completely unnecessary and is exactly what ISIS wants NATO to do. NATO should do no more than prevent serious genocide if they can but stay back and let the war unfold itself.

false,arselona,null,null,"I was at a round table where an old chap who should know better was trying to convince the room that foreign property purchases were one of the main reasons for property price inflation in London. This claim was met with broad derision across the room. 

He replied with an anecdote, claiming that some property developer friends of his believed some £50bln had flooded in from overseas locations like Russia, China and the middle east in 2013.

It may sound impressive, if not for two points.

1) Overseas investment is overly concentrated in certain areas of London. Mayfair, Knightsbridge, Hampstead etc. The fact that Prince Faisel Al Saud has bought a penthouse in Knightbridge has no bearing on the price that Mr Okonkwo will pay for his home in Holmerton.

What will be more of a driving factor for the price Mr Okonkwo's pays will be the the demand from young professionals from the UK, and increasingly the rest of the world for central London locations. 

You can still buy a nice Edwardian style home in quite a few parts of East London for close to £200k, and be within 15 minutes of the City, Canary Wharf, Silicon Round About, City Airport or Eurostar.

Do not discount that London has quickly become the capital of the world again in the last 10 years, and of all working European graduates, London is the primary overseas location.

2) Savills estimate that the London property market is valued at circa £1.1 trillion. That £50bln represents 4.5%. Other sources I have found believe that the £50bln is actually closer to £15bln. Thats not really the point however.

I believe that increasing stamp duty on foreigners to the extent that you advocate would be suicide. Overseas investors like us for simple reasons. Primarily that we make it easy for people to come here with their money. Despite what some have convinced themselves, the UK is an oasis of safety and respectability.

When you look at the moneyed elites of the emerging markets and where they are coming from and their options its obvious. The Chinese are desperate to get money out point blank, Russians have to deal with a mafia/kgb hybrid government, the middle east is a powder keg waiting to explode.

Capital is not rushing into Europe in its current state, and money from Europe is coming to the UK. The US is less of an attractive destination either since completely losing the plot just over a decade ago. 

30% of all UK debt is owned by overseas investors. These investors are not necessary living overseas, but were just born overseas. I've seen the process first hand, so I will explain. 

Rich Foreigner A (RFA) wants to come to the UK with their multi-million fortunes. Sees risk in homeland and wants security. Actually not so easy as one might think. 

RFA approaches private bank/wealth manager (PBWM) for a plan to move their £200m from Kazakstan to the UK. PBWM goes through the proper due diligence processes and starts process for RFA and family to apply for investor visas. 

Typically they will arrange for a property to be bought or rented in the usual areas. Remember, these people are coming to the UK for security, not opportunity. So long as they have a nice home, nice school for the kids, and pocket money they are happy for the bank to do what they want with money, so long as its not lost.

If we take the £200m fortune, and subtract £3-5m for a house in Kensington, £5-10m to be put aside for emergencies and living expenses. That leaves £175m to invest. 

Most of that will likely go into UK Government bonds paying 2.5% interest = £4.3m a year.

These banks are fighting over people coming to them to get into the UK as they will take a circa 1% management fee on assets under management (AUM). On £200m, thats £2m.

Lets look at the relationship. 

RFA gets UK Investor visa, property, £4.3 return on UK PLC investment safety and security.
PBWM gets £2m annual fees.
Uk Govt gets £175m funding.
UK public get entitlement programme funding.

The problem with the London housing market is really quite simple. We opened our borders to mass immigration and neglected to build any new homes for over a decade.

Its really that simple. 

I don't want to live in a country where the Government can dictate how many properties I can own. I don't particularly want to own lots, but I believe we deserve the right to have the economic freedom to do so.

Its very easy to bash the government on this, but 100k new homes is a really big deal. It is estimated that we need 800,000 more homes in and around London. Now that the economy has stabilised and is now the best performing developed economy in the world, these are the type of projects we can expect more of. 

Everywhere I go in London I see home building. Its just the start. 

I would encourage you to be pleased that after over a decade of neglect, a government is trying to do something about it.

false,FooFighterJL,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;I don't doubt that there should be more rights.

When formulating Human Rights law you always need to play a game of careful distinctions. If you state that somethings are rights (let's say right of prisoners to vote) in the same legislation as something like freedom of speech you will be faced with a dilemma. No one will like the former part. If that happens then you may, under the pressure of demographics, have an erosion of legislature's significance which can lead to the abuse of 'actual rights' which in this case would be the free-speech. 

Now I find it interesting that you would describe the ECHR as 'very successful'. In reality its about as important as a man on the street corner voicing his opinions. What happens if Cameron decides to ignore the ECHR? The ECHR's army will threaten invasion? Oh wait. Accountability under the ECHR only comes from the media/populous and maybe a little in Parliament for its decisions to actually be followed. This allowed Tony Blair to ignore some significant parts of the ECHR's rulings (if they were actually able to rule on anything he did which a lot of the time they couldn't because the document just simply didn't cover for the 21st century). So the fact you call the ECHR a 'very successful system' is utterly bizarre to me. 

&gt;If we want ECHR2 we should get our partners together and start negotiating.

I get this so often. 'Oh well if we're going to make a new one we should get all the nations back together.' What I have to tell these bloack-heads every time is that judicial rulings/legislation is *always* better when its sovereign. **ALWAYS!** This is just a simple law of political science. People take laws more seriously when they're coming from home-turf (and that goes for the politicians too). Your proposition would be unworkable in today's political environment. 

Let's take a basic example to show this. How toes the UK feel about banning the Burqa? Hm not to keen. How about you France? Hm pretty keen since that decision was based off their freakin' constitution. Well, this isn't going well. 

And what if, say, the UK wins on this one and Burqas are chill now. How are France going to react? Not nicely. What will they do? Probably just ignore the part that a huge part of population disagrees with, ultimately devaluing the entire nature of this new Human Rights Convention. 

Finally: the ECHR would not be scrapped if Cameron's plan succeeds. The HRA would simply be replaced and the UK would leave the increasingly pointless ECHR and go by its own Bill of Rights. Other nations would still adhere to [the parts they like of] the ECHR. So that was a strange comment too.

You either get criticised for focusing on one policy (I praise the one policy) or criticised for taking the party as a whole (I disagree with their stance on social welfare and believe they cannot afford some of the changes they suggest). 

You can tell me they have always suggested it and I can accept that. But if you don't believe that they brought it out as a cornerstone of their campaign against Labour then you're going against the exact words of the Ukip leader. If that's your stance then I don't know what to tell you. 

I think you're being very sensitive to some of the outrage against Ukip on here, but in which case you're wrong to direct your outage at me. Take a look at my post history. I think Ukip has done good to challenge the status quo in Westminster and I believe that it is up to the Green party to provide credible competition.

Edit: Either you're an adult at 18 or you aren't. If the government refuses to provide services to 18-21 year olds and insists on classifying them as children, they can certainly increase the child benefit threshold to 22, provide free prescriptions to under 22s, child tax credit up to 22, increase council tax exemption threshold from 18 to 22, and increase the threshold for any other benefits relating to children. 

Or not, fuck young people and their families, right?

Edit2: And if the government is deciding not to assist 18-21 year olds, perhaps 18-21 year olds should in return enjoy a lower rate of income tax when they are in employment? If I buy fish and chips from my local chippy, then they decide they're not going to give me any fish, just the chips, I don't expect to pay the full price for fish and chips. Why should this be any different? It would also mean that young people have a better chance of surviving the low pay they can expect when they're starting out, and possibly even begin saving so they can have their own safety net, given the government has basically told them to get fucked.

Look into different phone providers, they all have suit different needs, I use O2 as I find them easiest for communication. But others are better for people looking for internet data or regular international calls.

In terms of supermarkets I'm assuming you'll be on a student's budget; you can't go wrong with Aldi Or Lidl for basic food at a low cost. If you want more upmarket stuff and have money to spend I'd go with Waitrose, their stuff is generally good.

Also, think about social constructs that are consistent to British life. Be respectful when queueing and wait patiently, learn key phrases to talk about the weather (useful when there is nothing to discuss or to start a conversation).

Now obviously there are exceptions and cases where that doesn't work but I'm going to take it the policy has been even a little bit thought out and there will be a system of dealing with those. (probably further complicating our tax/benefits system, which I can't say I'm a fan of) We won't know until we see more than a tweet.

I honestly don't know much about the data on this as to how many would be affected, what the saving is, etc. so I don't know if its worth it. I don't think removing both benefits completely is sensible. Especially JSA, young people do still have costs, even if living with parents. But I can at least see a rational defence for not giving u21's housing allowance, or a very minimal amount which allows them to contribute to a family accommodation bill but not get their own place. I don't think someone under 21 automatically has a right to be able to move out from their parents, most of my friends who didn't go to university still live at home.

But my point is *why* does he want to leave the EU. I showed that he doesn't care about the principle of sovereignty (support for Israel and Putin), and he doesn't care about the principle of trying to be factually correct (bends facts to make EU look bad). He only seems to oppose the EU *because* it is the EU, not because of a combination of rationally thought out reasons.

&gt; I don't know about his private life but if they are properly bilingual rather than first-and-second languages then that wouldn't seem to be the target of his disdain

But the fact is that by using those statistics, he *is* making those types of children the target of his disdain, counting every child with a non-English language as a first language as a 'bloody immigrant, coming over here from the EU and making our schools less efficient'. He is, indirectly admittedly, demonising his own children to promote his political views, and also completely and knowingly bending the facts to promote his views as well, two types of thing we really shouldn't support. 

&gt; I don't know what Putin or Israel have to do with this, if anything they are very good at maintaining their own sovereignty.

Did you actually read what I said mate? On the one hand, Farage complains about the EU removing British sovereignty, and uses it as a justification to leave the EU. On the other hand, he and his party support Israel's actions in Palestine, which is removing Palestinian sovereignty, and puts primary blame for the Ukraine crisis on the EU, not Russia, showing he opposes the EU more than he opposes Russia directly attacking the sovereignty of Ukraine. It shows, again, he has no principle for supporting sovereignty, rather uses it as another argument to oppose the EU for the sake of opposing the EU.

&gt; If by EU inefficiencies you mean MEP allowances and by profiting you mean ""being an MEP"" I think it's not at all immoral to try to change a system from the inside.

But the point is they aren't trying to change anything. It is self serving, costing British tax payers money so they can line their own pockets. If they actually cared primarily about opposing EU inefficiencies, they would either bring it up in the European Parliament (where they are too busy turning their backs to flags and calling Germans Nazis), or they would take that money but donate it to charity.

GlossyboxUK sucks. Every few months they include a full-size item to appease subscribers, but a vast majority of the samples are tiny.

There really is no Ipsy equivalent. Ipsy was almost all make-up products with maybe one hair/skin product each month. Everything I've found here has less make-up.

But then, you lose your job! Oh no, what now? You can move in with your parents but what about the house you're renting? You'll only be out of work for a couple of months at most but now you're being evicted and your whole world is crumbling - you'll have to rebuild it from scratch in a couple of months, just so that David Cameron can talk about how he's reduced the welfare spend by x% this year.

I don't think it's hugely relevant whether someone's parents can support them or not, or whether or not someone has a good relationship with their parents or not. I think where we must differ is that I believe the right to live independently is indeed a right, and not one that needs to be bought.

In my personal case, just to put my cards on the table, I have an awful relationship with my mother and I can't even let her know my address. I don't know where my father even lives. I was out of work for a while and while I was actually over 21, I could easily have been in the 18-21 range under different circumstances. I for one have really come into my own since leaving home, and I would not be the same person if I was forced to be dependent on my parents again.

I think you may find that your ""exceptions"" are much more common than you might think. Which would either make the system unworkable, or it would produce a system that is so convoluted and difficult to negotiate that it works by simply making it too hard to claim, leaving young people out in the cold anyway.

Let's call a spade a spade; this is a cost cutting exercise targeting the lowest turnout demographic on election day, because that will result in the least actual backlash. It helps absolutely nobody, and screws young people and their parents simultaneously.

false,mr-strange,null,null,"Two points:

1\. You seem to have fundamentally misunderstood /u/G_Morgan's point.

He wrote:

&gt; The ECHR does exactly what it was intended for. What has changed is the politics in this country.

Your response:

&gt; the politics of the UK have 0 effect on the ECHR

The argument isn't that UK politics have somehow undermined the ECHR, but that rights which were considered inalienable when the Convention was drafted are now routinely and systematically violated by UK politicians. Those politicians now see the ECHR as a threat to their desire to continue violating our rights, and so they have done all they can to undermine it, and now finally, to attempt to withdraw from it.

For example, having detained Abu Qatada without trial for some years, the UK wished to deport him, but was [prevented by the ECHR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othman_(Abu_Qatada)_v._United_Kingdom) because the judges said it would violate his right to a fair trial. This is exactly the kind of state abuse that the ECHR was explicitly designed to stop. That's ""exactly what it was intended for"". The concept and meaning of a ""fair trial"" hasn't changed since the ECHR was signed. What has changed is the willingness of UK politicians to violate that right when they consider it inconvenient. Hence, ""What has changed is the politics in this country.""

Now you may disagree with /u/G_Morgan's analysis, but you can't credibly argue against him unless you actually address his points.

2\. You really need to proof read.

&gt; it (the judges) did **manage it infer** half of the handing downs it has now

This is gibberish.

&gt; However, it is vital to distinguish between what are most **defiantly** rights and what most **defiantly** are not.

I think if we were going to stick with Mignolet then we couldn't afford to have Reina as well, as great as his history with us is. And I don't think Reina felt estranged in the end either, his final statement was warm. 

Same with Agger. He never said anything against Rodgers, there was one quote taken out of context but on a whole he understood why things happened how they did. He acknowledged his injury issues as well. I don't think it's fair to say poor man management when there are other clear reasons why these players are offloaded. 

I also don't know what you mean by Alberto, unless you're confusing a player needing more time to develop and being sent on loan for poor man management. Like Aspas, sometimes these transfers don't work out. 

Sahin's situation has been extensively discussed--Brendan brought him in to play the deeper role that Gerrard ended up doing well in. Sahin-Gerrard would've been a worse combination than Lucas-Gerrard.
