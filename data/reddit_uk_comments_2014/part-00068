Finding out that all the nodding heads and encouragement was only because they were making money from having you at their university.

I'm sure graduates will go forward with a more appropriate sense of scepticism, but did we really need it to cost them 4 (3 in England) years?

There's only a finite number of well above average jobs. Not everybody can have them. Unless you've got a 2:1 from one of the top few universities in your field you should probably forget university.

Nobody at any point along the journey is interested in telling students that their dream career won't be waiting for them at the end of their degree. 

I'm not sure what the solution is.  Perhaps tuition fees paid where there's a significantly above average employment rate at above average salary within x number of years of graduation? That will obviously drive the best applicants into the best courses.. but will it be good in the long run?

I am writing to you to express my concern at the decision to remove the advert relating to the six nations rugby located at the following link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbvbQPq4LXk

The decision to remove the advert is a misuse of resource and in my view an offence to the majority of people who pay the licence fee.

I would ask you send me the full reasoning as to why this advert was removed, if you are unable to i would ask you consider this under a freedom of information request.

Finally i would ask that the decision to remove the advert is reversed.

&gt; Limited liability partnerships... joined the lexicon of British corporate law only in 2000 as a result of heavy lobbying from Britain's big accountancy partnerships, which wanted to limit their liability for carrying out dodgy audits without becoming limited companies and so incurring extra taxes. The new corporate vehicle allowed them to have it both ways by stipulating that an LLP would have limited liability but would not be a taxable entity itself.
&gt;
&gt; The new hybrid had great appeal: not just to respectable accountants, but also to those who were up to no good. For if an LLP's members can also claim that they are not taxable in the UK, there is nothing to trouble the taxman and no inconvenient questions will be asked by the authorities about what the LLP is up to.

Essentially LLPs whose constitutive members are offshore, and who do not conduct business in the UK, do not provide reasons to attract attention from HMRC. However, as UK-resident corporate bodies, they are not generally of interest to any other country's tax authorities either. From Companies House having no power to investigate false accounts; such as those of a shell agency claiming to be dormant, through to suspicions needing to be routed to the Serious Organised Crime Agency to investigate international crime (and SOCA are not going to pay attention to you if you have no evidence which, of course, you cannot gain because of the shell LLPs which you would need SOCA to investigate) it should be absolutely apparent that when we discuss the use of LLPs to launder money we are talking about a structural problem in HMG's approach to financial crime.",0,1394337895,null,0,false,0,cfxz5lq,t3_1zxe1u,t1_cfxz5lq,t1_cfxyar5,null,1432719914,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

There may well be problems in how false accounts can be investigated etc and in fact that may be HMGs fault but the point I hoped to get across was there is nothing inherently wrong with such a structure; it can be and is used for totally transparent legitimate purposes.

How would that be any different to someone just killing a rich relative anyway? You make it sound as if there'd be thousands of rich people being coerced into going to a suicide clinic to top themselves. It's nonsense. If someone was so intent on doing that then they could buy a one way ticket to Dignitas and get it done there. I'm happy to be proven wrong but I've not heard a story of that happening.

Even the governments very own fucking website states
&gt;Clare’s Law – the Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme – is designed to provide victims with information that may protect them from an abusive situation before it ends in tragedy. The scheme allows the police to disclose information about a partner’s previous history of domestic violence or violent acts.


As for 

&gt;To mark International Women's Day the government also announced the introduction of domestic violence protection orders (DVPOs), designed to provide protection for women in the initial aftermath of an attack by imposing conditions that can immediately prevent contact.

Well that's a load of fucking bollocks as well because the governments very own fucking website also states

&gt;From today Domestic Violence Protection Orders (DVPOs) are also being rolled out across England and Wales.This new power will enable police and magistrates’ courts to provide protection to victims in the immediate aftermath of a domestic violence incident.

While that *may* be reasonable - I have (maybe naively) come to expect more from this country; after hearing it preach to other countries about racism, gay marriage, health for all, for example, one would expect it to *lead by example*.

I've been extraordinarily let down by the BBC's reporting of events in Crimea - instead parroting hyperbole from the USA without providing a shred of balance from the other side. That I have to actually watch RT (Russia Today) to find out what the other side thinks/feels is utterly appalling.

BBC journalists used to be welcomed worldwide - even by terrorist organisations - who wanted to put their side of the story across. But you can understand how such journalists may be attacked or killed now given how twisted a view of events they now show.

And if you had opinions about racial relations, gay marriage, or immigration in this country that didn't conform to the ""BBC ideal"" would you honestly welcome a BBC reporter asking your opinion? No! You'd attack them or walk away. Because they sure as hell don't respect your opinion.

I wasn't impressed the way, after the Russian Winter Olympics closing ceremony, the BBC reporter then had a dig at the Russians on gay rights. She wasn't interested in sport! The BBC weren't covering sport! They were a vehicle interested only in gay rights.

I got two phone interviews and two assessment centres (one of which led to my current job.) I'm willing to guess it's partly down to the stuff I was doing outside of my course (club officer roles) and partly that I had work experience from the summer - even if it was running a till. When you're applying with a 2.2, you've got to accept that 70% or so of the 'big' employers won't let you apply. I don't know for chemistry, but for engineers there are a hell of a lot of smaller companies who take on one to two grads a year and may be your route in. As well as that,  I'd recommend keeping an eye on gradcracker.com, which has several vacancies for 2.2 chemists open atm.


Don't give up! Having been there I appreciate the grind of applying for jobs, and the kick in the teeth when an assessment centre you thought went well comes back with nothing.

Though I note that these have become unavailable - I suppose newer models are coming out at a rapid pace.

It's worth checking http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/buffalo/start to see if a router's hardware is supported by OpenWRT.

Apart from the first flashing, which is always a little tricky, these devices have been great! Though they can be around the £70-90 mark the Gigabit switch on the back is wonderful.

On another point - this approach does not necessarily work in cup competitions where you only need to lose once.

Benitez' approach was to systematically analyse the players, systems and strengths of each opposing team and to draw upon a vast squad of chess pieces to deny that team success; hence a system that worked particularly well in cup competitions but did not produce enough 'wins' to place consistently highly in a points tallying league system.

This creativity kept him out of position all the time and then he had to try and rely on his pace to get back. 

Walker is not this. Kyle Walker in my opinion is one of the best RBs in the premiership. Certainly the most athletic. He defends well, and has some of the best overlapping runs I've seen short of Alaba and Lahm. However Kyle Walker does possess the same blistering pace and creativity that Bale did before he converted. So I think in the short term he might provide a much needed spark to the attack. There are drawbacks to this though. His right foot, is not even half of Bale's left, this is apparent in he less than stellar placement of crosses and passes. Also he is prone to mistakes which could be a killer to the attack.

Basically we really won't know until we try, however he does have a similar make up to what our 18 year old Welshman had some years ago.

When I was 17/18 and applying to Uni in 2007 prior to the economy turning sour, the advice we had received was to study something preferably academic that we enjoyed - because transferable skills would be the dominant marketable attribute (rather than vocational transfer-ability of the course at hand). This was simply due to high availability of jobs, especially within the public sector.

By the time we all graduated in 2010/11, the game had completely changed and we had a job market that really didn't give too much of a shit about traditional academic subjects and ultimately had the power to preference those with the vocational strengths (always useful to limit spend on training costs). The public sector had put up a wall to graduates, with the remaining Fast Track scheme being extremely hard (and highly favouring private school children - there is a study out there I believe). 

I'm not saying our career advisors could have anticipated the future years, but it goes to say that if those advising us got it entirely wrong, asking a 17 year old to seriously rate their future chances of employment and earnings given their subject choice would be rather limited at best.",0,1394359603,null,0,false,0,cfy4hi4,t3_1zvvp9,t1_cfy4hi4,t1_cfxgi0c,null,1432722486,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Your insurance is going to be your biggest bill. It'll be disgustingly big. Look at coop young drivers insurance, they put a black box in your car that measures speed/braking etc. Speeding will put your premium up after 6 months (up to 20%), driving normally will reduce it (15%). In my experience, they're pretty lenient. I have done the good old 'get your 11y/o car to 100MPH' a couple of times and my insurance has stayed low.

Now, if your parents are still about and have clean records, PUT THEM ON THE INSURANCE AS SECOND DRIVERS. Or your grandparents/aunt with 10 years no claims. In the coop insurance form, you set how many miles each person will be doing. I set myself to be doing 3-4k and my mum and dad to be doing 2-3k each (I'm still the main driver so it's legal  and I build no claims. I get 10k miles a year to drive and if I crash I'm covered as far as I can tell) this reduces your premium even more.. I'll give you numbers: most people in my year paid £2500+ for insurance first year! mine was £1300. Fully comp. this year was £650, next year I get to play the market I think.

&gt; Gender pay gap among self-employed widens to 40% as workers failing to find jobs register as business owners

First, starting one's own business is not the resort of someone who's failed. It is not a negative thing. It's a brave move that can lead to an incredibly successful future for them and that can create jobs for many others, and it's something entirely to be applauded, and not spun with the usual cynical Guardian light. Self-employed people aren't failures, they're pioneers, and people who've asserted control of their own destiny. They deserve respect, not derision. 

Secondly, the nature of self-employment is that pay ceases to be a thing. You don't get paid, you earn directly based on the success and the value of your endeavour or your service. This article doesn't portray inequality, it infers that women are shit at being self-employed. And that's bollocks.

It's this sort of article that makes me dislike the Guardian. It's blatantly clear how they're cherry-picking sources (""some economists...""), dismissing any counter-argument (""There may be perfectly good reasons for being self-employed...""), ignoring any positives, taking a very incomplete view of the figures (for example, a woman earning £10k with self-employment could claim an additional £7800 in benefits and tax credits, according to EntitledTo.co.uk), and writing in the usual vague anecdotal conspiracy garbage (""Evidence has emerged..."").

&gt;Money alone means nothing if you're not surrounded by the right people and buy shitty players

I know it's crazy that Chelsea have all this money but fail to win everything every year isn't it.

Spurs have a net transfer spend of 20m. They earnt their money the right way - by buying a youngster for cheap and turning him into a world class player and selling him for a magnificent price. They were limited on who to buy however, as Spurs aren't exactly a top club in the Champions League.

&gt;How about Real Madrid. One of the richest clubs on the planet... Can't win a CL

They've won nine.

&gt;You're club chooses to have a nice bank balance and now tolerates mediocrity and a 4th place trophy. Go cry somewhere else.

Your*.

Last time I checked we bought a world class player and are challenging for trophies.

Whether we win trophies or not: the fact that we are challenging and buying world class players with the money we received from Champions League football and sponsorships clearly shows that we are not settling for mediocrity.

Edit: Anyway, Henderson had resale value, if Lallana doesn't perform to the same standard whoever bought him is going to take a big loss.

It also depends on who decides to come in for him, if someone like us, Chelsea or United come in for him, then fair play he'll probably go for at least 20m, maybe more.  However those teams may also feel they can get more quality elsewhere for that price.  If it comes down to a team like Newcastle or Everton looking to sign him I doubt they'd be willing to spend 20m on a player with little resale value if he doesn't continue playing the way he has.  I also don't know what Southampton's books look like or who they have coming through their youth system, which are all factors in determining how much you're going to demand/settle for.  

Basically, I could see him going for 20m if the right teams are in for him but unless it's one of the teams near the top 5-6 I don't think anyone else is going to be willing to spend that much money on him.  When you take away Us, United, City, Spurs, Arsenal and Chelsea you're talking about a record transfer fee for most teams at 20m.  Some teams like Everton, Newcastle and Villa are right around their already, but not many others.  Like I said, Southampton might not be willing to let him go for less than 20m but I don't think it's a given someone will come in and pay that.

I remember seeing on the news of a guy who went to court asking to be euthanized but then 4 days later he died because he refused to eat. It's sad that he became so depressed and probably felt like he was being let down by his own country before his death.

I know there's a risk that people could murder someone and say they euthanized them but there's a lot of measures which could prevent this. You could get a lawyer/police officer to come in and witness the person who wants to be euthanized sign a contract (or film them saying they would like to be euthanized if they're unable to sign it). Without the signature or the evidence, the euthanasia couldn't take place and if someone *did* murder someone but then said it was euthanasia, they'd know it was murder.

We do need more creativity on the pitch, but I think part of our problem is the tentativeness.

This tentative play most often results in giving our opponents too much time to re-form their lines and, once again, we are facing a crowded midfield and too many defenders in the box.

The thing is, I think we can still do a lot better with the players we have.  There are some glaring oversights in the current roster (left back, centre back, striker), but we've got more than enough talent to be competitive.  Look at other teams this season that have overachieved on similar or lesser resources - is Jordan Henderson an outright better play than any of our midfielders?

The most galling thing to me is the utter lack of consistency, from club vision all the way down to player selection.  Every manager that comes in seems to be the antithesis of the last (swinging back and forth from old school British 'ave a go-ers to cultured continentals), and every game seems to be a random selection of players because evidently no one is putting in the kind of performances that make them an automatic selection aside from Ade, Walker and Eriksen.

We need more consistency.  A good manager can work with these materials, buying/selling a select handful, but shaping this team into something with greater mental fortitude.  Our psychology is obviously what's wrong... whether it's Soldado, or the team's caving in time and time again.  But it's likely going to take some time to undo all the shit that's weighed us down the last couple of years, and start slowly crafting a side capable of playing decent football.

Is he choosing to start out on his own, to advertise his services, to find clients and so on?

Is his current employer encouraging him to become self employed and contract with them, so he'll work at the same place just under a different contract?

-----

The reason I bring it up is your wording suggests *someone else* will be deciding his pay, that it's the latter, which isn't how self employment is intended to work. You become a business unto yourself and you can earn as much or as little as you are capable of dragging through the door.

*However* some companies like to convince their employees to go to 'self employed contracts' where nothing really changes, you still show up to the same place to work every day but now you do your own taxes.

In a lot of cases that arrangement is **illegal**, it's the company offloading tax obligations to the employee so rather than paying them £18,000/year and then paying the related tax to the government in addition.. they just pay the employee £18k/year and make them pay their own tax, meaning you don't actually earn £18k/year.

Self employment comes with some benefits but also gives up some that regular employees get. For example a self employed person can set their own hours, can hire someone to do the work for them, provides their own equipment, is not entitled to sick/maternity or redundancy pay.

An employer can't just decide you are going to be self employed, if you look like an employee and think you're an employee then as far as HMRC are concerned you are and the company has tax and employee rights obligations.

true,inmyendismybeginning,null,null,"After leaving Carberry Hill, Orkney fled with Seton to Dunbar, but was unable to raise troops in the Borders. Having sailed to Linlithgow, he travelled by land to Dumbarton. This proved a more successful rallying point, with fifty men of rank joining him, including Lord John and Archbishop Hamilton and Fleming, who still held Dumbarton Castle on Mary’s behalf. They realised that an immediate attack on Lochleven would risk her life, but, while they dithered, support for Bothwell melted away. Still looking for assistance, he commandeered four men-of-war as Lord High Admiral and sailed with Seton and Fleming to Aberdeenshire. On arrival, he visited Strathbogie, but Huntly ‘heartily wished both his sister and the Queen rid of so wicked a husband’ [1] and would not raise the north to help him. Feeling suddenly isolated, Seton and Fleming refused him further assistance. He had sailed north and by the end of July was with his kinsman the Bishop of Moray at Spynie, but his arrival was betrayed  and he moved on with 200 men to Kirkwall in Orkney. As Duke, he controlled Orkney Castle, but its bailiff, Gilbert Balfour, Sir James’s brother, trained the castle guns on his ships to prevent them from landing, so he headed on for Shetland. where three of his vessels were captured with all those on board, including his henchmen from Kirk o’ Field, Cullen, Hay of Talla and Hepburn of Bolton, but Orkney escaped with two ships to Norway.

When Orkney arrived in Norway (then part of Denmark) he hove to at Karm Island, north of Stavanger, but he was arrested for suspected piracy. On 2 September, he was taken with his two ships and 140 men to the castle at Bergen, where the Governor, Eric Rosencrantz, uncertain whether he really was the Duke of Orkney, entertained him lavishly, while awaiting instructions. Yet Orkney’s luck ran out. Anna Throndssen was now living in Bergen with her mother, and immediately sued him for breach of promise to marry her, sending some of her kinsmen to arrest him with creditors from his earlier visit to Denmark. To stop their action, Orkney promised to pay Anna an annuity in Scotland and handed over the smaller of his two ships. On 23 September, he was carried to Copenhagen on one of Frederick’s ships for ‘honourable confinement’ in the castle. [12] He was permitted to write to Charles IX seeking French assistance for Mary’s release. When Moray asked Charles IX to put pressure on Frederick to repatriate Orkney to Scotland, the French King does not appear to have done so, and Orkney was left as a potentially lucrative political hostage in Denmark. Although confined to his rooms, he was allowed visitors and books to read and initially was held in some comfort dressed in velvet clothes, even being escorted hunting.  

On 5 January 1568, Orkney completed his memoirs, setting out a version of events aimed at procuring his release. He dictated them in French to a Danish secretary, later having them published as Les Affaires du Conte Boduel. He depicted himself as a chivalrous knight seeking to rescue Mary from the ‘seditious lords’, who ‘did all they could to oppose her’, especially Moray, who was attempting to usurp the throne. 

After making manuscript corrections, he arranged for a second copy to be sent to Frederick, but the Danish King remained unsympathetic and transferred him for greater security to Malmö Castle (now in Sweden) on the eastern side of the Sound into the Baltic. Yet he remained decently housed in a large vaulted chamber below the royal apartments. 

Moray was determined to silence Orkney. Mary had been able to send him messages fairly freely from Lochleven, through his Danish page, Herman; Hepburn of Riccarton provided another communication conduit. On 13 January 1568, Mary had given Orkney authority to offer the Orkney and Shetland islands to Frederick II, if he would send Danish troops and ships to her assistance. Yet she was by then already deposed, and Moray, as Regent, would never have agreed. With Frederick hoping to recover the islands as a ransom for Orkney’s release without having to risk a military invasion, Orkney remained in captivity. 

When Mary escaped from Lochleven, Moray feared that Orkney might be freed by the Danes to give evidence at an enquiry into the King’s death. Shortly before the Conference at York, he again pressed Frederick for his extradition to Scotland. He sent Captain John Clark, a Scottish mercenary serving in Denmark, to arrange for him to be extradited with Paris, but with instructions to take him ‘dead or alive’ or to allow Clark to execute him. On 30 October 1568, Clark gave their keeper, Peter Oxe, a receipt for Paris and William Murray, intending to bring them to Scotland for trial. Yet Frederick still saw Orkney as a bartering counter and again refused his extradition. Clark had come to Scotland in early 1567 with Danish money to raise mercenaries for Frederick’s army, but Orkney warned Frederick that the money had been used to fund the Confederates at Carberry Hill. This led to Clark being court-martialled and imprisoned in Dragsholm Castle on the north-west Jutland coast.  

As has been seen, there was no urgency to repatriate Paris and Murray. They did not reach Scotland until the Conferences in England had ended, after which Paris’s two conflicting depositions were made under torture. Although Moray had assured Cecil that they would be found ‘so authentic as the credit thereof shall not seem doubtful’, [16] Cecil could see their obvious shortcomings and wrote to prevent Paris’s execution.  He called for Paris to be sent to London, but his letter (as perhaps he hoped) arrived too late. Moray had already arranged for him to be hung, drawn and quartered without trial. 
In 1571, during Lennox’s Regency, Thomas Buchanan renewed efforts for Orkney to be extradited back to Scotland. It had been discovered that Orkney was again discussing with Mary the transfer of the Orkney and Shetland Islands to Denmark in return for his freedom, which ‘was prejudicial and hurtful to both our countries and to the discontentment of the Queen’s Majesty of England’. [17] Yet again Frederick refused his release. It was not until 1573, after Elizabeth had at last recognised James as King of Scotland, that Frederick realised that he would never collect a ransom in return for freeing Orkney and moved him to join Clark at Dragsholm. Despite Morton making one further effort at extradition in June 1574, Frederick still refused. 

Orkney was rumoured to have lived out his remaining days at Dragsholm in solitary confinement, chained to a post in a dungeon too small for him to stand. Yet the truth was less austere. Having resolved his differences with Clark, they drowned their sorrows in wine, resulting in Clark’s death from alcoholic excess in July 1575. Although it was reported that Orkney had died four months later, he was ‘but great swollen and not yet dead’, but suffering from liver or kidney failure. [18]

He lived on for three more years in increasing insanity until 14 April 1578. He was buried at Dragsholm in the parish church, where it is claimed that his ghost still haunts the castle, now a hotel. Herries, who later visited Dragsholm, reported that Orkney had latterly become overgrown with hair and filth.

So, no one goes to a spring training game expecting to see a World Series lineup.  In this case, the Marlins had a home game against the Red Sox, one of the most popular teams, and charged a premium ticket price.  So people paid extra to see a bunch of Red Sox reserves play, and the Marlins deflected blame to the Red Sox.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"This is one of those things that keeps popping up and it is really a case of the club suffering from its own success.

Before Levy got here we were a mess virtually every season, sure we would jump up here and there and do well but we would slip back the next season and wonder if we would climb the hill again and if so when.

Since Levy (and lets not forget rich Uncle Joe) has arrived we have climbed up the table and now sit in an area where we are consistently competing for Europa/CL slots.  This is much, MUCH more preferable to where we were before they came to the club.

The catch is of course with the success we have experienced the expectations have been raised. I don't know that as a club (certainly as supporters) we have learned to adapt to the new reality. From the aspect of the club we certainly don't seem to have a grasp on how exactly build a squad, we can recognize talent but we don't seem to be great at molding a squad (this was true under Tim, AVB and in truth 'Arry). As supporters we are in an odd slot, we absolutely feel that we should be better, that we should be up the table...those are the expectations that have been set by the club, but when we don't meet the expectations we have no idea how to deal with it, we may be playing better than we have in decades but it is still a failure in the eyes of many. Perspective for a Spurs supporter (really from most fans/supporters of any sports team) seems to be very narrow and as a result we are continually struggling to come to terms with who we actually are as a club.

As for this season it generally feels a bit like things are just broken. Under AVB it was reported that a schism had opened between AVB and the the rest of the club, that he no longer spoke with the front office, that he all but banished Freund, Les and Tim from dealing with the first team and certainly didn't seem to respect their opinions on the youth players, he froze out Ade etc, etc, etc. 
 
Under Tim we had the bump in performance for a bit, like the the pressure was relieved from the squad. Ade was back in the lineup, Bentaleb was introduced (and at this rate potentially Veljković and Shaq) and Freund and Les were involved. But this seems to be a patch, as if we were winning not because of Tim but because we were allowing the talent to play more freely than it had been allowed under AVB, we seem to be winning a number of our matches simply because we are more talented than the other team.  Now we are seeing the patch slip off a little and issues old and new are surfacing.

One of the major issues we seem to be facing is a sense of apathy on the squad. I've said it yesterday, our squad seems to ""like"" Tim but i am not sure they truly respect him for one reason or another. The same seemed to be the case under AVB.  Additionally we don't have the fiery leader of the squad on the pitch, we seem to have a few players who can rise to a challenge and some genuine competitors but we don't seem to have a unifying player that can demand a teammate respond to the challenge in front of them.

I saw it said it yesterday by someone that we spent the summer worrying about how to replace Bale, the summer before it was how do we replace Modric.  However now it seems like the questions we should have been asking wasn't just how to replace Modders/Bale/VDV but how do we replace Ledley, Gallas and Parker? We brought in a group of new players and didn't have an anchor to help them adjust to the squad, to push them to serve as a guidepost on the pitch.  I think this affected not only the new players but AVB and now Tim is having the same issue.

We are in an odd slot at the moment, we are close enough where a series of fuckups (and it will take other teams having issues for us move up) by other teams will land us in the seeming ""promised land"", but we are also in an area where if we slip then it will be considered a catastrophic failure for the season.

The only way i see us really correcting what is going on is to make a bold move in the summer.  To me the easiest is the LVG rumor, if he is available and wants to come then go all out and bring him in let him clean house and create a new identity for the club, one that can be bought into from the bottom up and fostered for several years forward. This would be a step to help address the expectations that the club and the supporters in this new era of Spurs.

To go along with LvG i would say we need to identify a player or two that we can bring in who have that ""field general"" attitude who will bring back the fire we are missing. This would be more a short term solution, but would serve as a bridge until we identify a new leader on the pitch.

We have issues, but i think we can fix them. If we can fix the issues then the expectations of both the club and the supporters will seem more in line and instead of complaining about failure in a period of success as a club we can start building to setting new expectations and definitions of success.

-----------------

[Long version, copied from the [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1zuu4y/clares_law_introduced_to_tackle_domestic_violence/) a couple of days ago:]

[Its not](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/1zuu4y/clares_law_introduced_to_tackle_domestic_violence/cfx7hue) a law. It is a scheme that uses the existing law under which the police can disclose information if doing so is necessary to prevent a crime.

The way the scheme works is as follows:

If someone (including social services etc.) has reason to suspect that someone they or another person are in a relationship with may be violent, they can mention this to the police.

If the police believe them, they can check if they have information that might be relevant (e.g. a record of violent offences), and if there is they will decide (in consultation with social services, iirc) whether they can or should disclose some or all of this.

They are still bound by normal confidentiality/privacy rules, so can only disclose what is necessary and proportionate in order to prevent a crime.

----

[In response to more questions:]

If you want more information there are leaflets about the scheme on the websites of some of the Police forces who ran the trials (there may be some overlap), in particular:

* [Dorset Police's guide](http://www.dorset.police.uk/pdf/Clare%27s%20Law%20-%20Booklet.pdf)

* [Guide for 3rd Parties](http://www.nottinghamshire.police.uk/sites/default/files/documents/files/DomesticViolenceDisclosureSchemeLeafletThirdParty_0-11.pdf) from the Home Office,

&gt; How would I prove I am someones partner to request info about them?

That will be up to the police; they will require some evidence of this, along with details of who you are. Perhaps evidence that the person lives at the same address, perhaps photographs; whatever it takes for the police to be convinced (and they will carry out their own checks).

&gt; Would it be limited to only me who can ask?

No. From the Dorset leaflet: ""Any concerned third party, such as your parent, neighbour or friend can also make an application if they are concerned about you."" However the police will only give information out to ""someone who is in a position to use the information to protect"" the potential victim.

So if a mother-in-law raises a concern with the police, the police may still notify the potential victim.

The beauty of probation is you can stipulate in the contract that you can terminate their employment with no notice. Make sure you take the best candidate from your applicant pool and then pay them the wage that the job after training will pay.

Personally I would never ever work for free for anything that is not charitable. So employers who were seeking work experience staff or interns would automatically have ruled me out as a prospective employee. Even when I was unemployed and living of JSA! If you offer a professional salary you will get professional applicants.

You will be putting a lot of faith into the person you hire but thats why your interview process and assessment process needs to be top notch. Get the person best for the post and then actually hire them, don't mess them about with no pay or living allowances just because others get away with it.

Only extend their contract if you are happy that they fit in and can make a long term contribution. The business about if they get one sale is flawed on any number of levels, eg the slow starter who might become a star performer or even worse, the problem employee who makes that one sale on the last day.

It's about 10 miles, and you basically walk from the village of Elgol right into the heart of the Cuillins. There's a bothy in Camusunary, if you're getting tired of the tent. You can fairly easily walk to Loch Coruisk (one tricky section called, not very inventively, The Bad Step) from Camusunary. It is very beautiful, but there are boat trips a few times a day from Easter onwards so it might break the peace a little bit. You could walk right through the glen, out to Sligachan, which is another 9 miles or so. This, I think, is part of the Skye trail, which you can continue around the Braes to Portree (I think about 13 miles, mostly on the road), then start on the Trotternish ridge, ending up eventually at Duntulmn in the North end (can't remember how long this part is, but it's usually a two-dayer for most people). I agree with Lukeyhear that to see all of Skye you would be better off with a car, but with this, you'd see a lot of the best bits - Cuillins, Coruisk, Storr, Quirang; with hills, glens and coastal sections. I don't think you'd be disappointed. You could always get a lift out to Neist Point (which would pretty much be an epic slog from the North End) or the from Sligachan to the Fairy Pools (Glen Sligachan is the wrong side of the ridge).

I just want everyone to get a little context on this situation because it's deeper than the Red Sox didn't field a high quality squad.

The Marlins ownership is pathetic.  They exist only to skim money off the team.  They pay 35m in wages against a league average of ~100m.  They fleeced and threatened the city of Miami into building them a new stadium, stuck the tax payers with a $2 billion bill and then gutted the team and payroll so they could suck all the revenue off the top.  (Edit: It's quite a story- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlins_Park#Planning_and_controversy)

For anyone who doesn't know there's no salary cap in baseball like there is in the NFL, NHL and NBA.  In the MLB there's a tax threshold, once you spend a certain amount of money on players you put a percentage of the money that is over the threshold into a pool with other teams who are over the threshold.  That money is then split up and given to the remaining teams who didn't break the threshold.  This is done to help small market teams who don't make as much money as the Red Sox/Yankees/Dodgers compete in the player market, it discourages big teams from spending obscene amounts on wages and helps smaller teams spend more.

Only 5 teams have ever broken that threshold.  The Red Sox have broken that threshold 6 times.  The Yankees have broken it 11 times (every year since it's existed).  The Marlins have never broken it.

The Marlins owner wants everyone else to spend money so he can take it off the top.  He wants the city to build the stadium.  He wants the other team to attract his fans and he even wants the other teams to subsidize his player wages.  He's a fucking skunk and I'm glad JH gave him a big ""fuck you."" because owners like him ruin sports.

PC Keith Wallis was jailed for what Mr Justice Sweeney described as his guilt of *sustained, and in significant measure, devious misconduct which fell far below the standards expected of a police officer*. He was fired alongside PC James Glanville, who passed information to the Sun despite not having been present at the event himself but having met up with several of the other officers later. This by no means proves that he was lying about the material passed on. Three more officers are currently under investigation for gross misconduct.

The original claim that Andrew Mitchell used the phrase 'pleb' was made by PC Toby Rowland; regardless of what we might be able to prove in the future, it is certain that either him or Andrew Mitchell are liars, and mutual suits for libel are ongoing, and there is good reason to question the validity of witness statements given in defence of Rowland's claims. Indeed, the continuing investigation into police misconduct over the issue and the previous conviction ought proves Andrew Mitchell's claim that this was a 'stitch-up'. However, as you've said, as of writing only one officer has been proven in court to have lied.

&gt;Neoliberalism is in the first instance a theory of political economic practices that proposes that human well-being can best be advanced by liberating individual entrepreneurial freedoms and skills within an institutional framework characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade. The role of the state is to create and preserve an institutional framework appropriate to such practices. (p. 2) 

In economic terms, it's a mixture of a number of schools of thought: 

&gt;The economic ideas marshalled in support of the neoliberal turn amounted, Blyth suggests, to a complex fusion of monetarism (Friedman), rational expectations (Robert Lucas), public choice (James Buchanan, and Gordon Tullock), and the less respectable but by no means uninfluential ‘supply-side’ ideas of Arthur Laffer, who went so far as to suggest that the incentive effects of tax cuts would so increase economic activity as to automatically increase tax revenues (Reagan was enamoured of this idea). 

&gt;The more acceptable commonality to these arguments was that government intervention was the problem rather than the solution, and that ‘a stable monetary policy, plus radical tax cuts in the top brackets, would produce a healthier economy’ by getting the incentives for entrepreneurial activity aligned correctly.

Shelvey had plenty of chances at this club and BR decided that he wasn't up to snuff.

Moses is on loan and BR hasn't really had a single successful loan player yet.  Sahin was a tragedy, Cissokho is not good, and Moses couldn't care less based on the way he looks when he's on the pitch.

Holtby isn't 20% of what he's made out to be on this sub. He's hailed as some sort of creative genius which he's not. He's not half the player Coutinho is, since you brought him up, and the only reason this sub likes him so much is because he has the right attitude and a good personality. He's a likable fellow, and probably a positive influence on the squad - but on the pitch he's very average. He's a workhorse, he's run around and he'll put in a tackle and every now and then he'll find a good pass, but he isn't close to what Eriksen is nor is he close to being ""the player we need"" as of now.

3 years later, who knows?

He set up Sidwell (I think) for a good goal against United, he scored a cracker against Fulham, and he had a really nice pass through to Defoe in the Europa league which Defoe slammed home, and Holtby set up Lamela for a nice pass to Paulinho which got us the winner against Cardiff.

Those are his highlights for all the time he's spent at Spurs. I can list them out on one hand. There was too much of a craze around him being signed for a ridiculously low fee, but the matter of the fact is that he needs 2-3 years of development in the English league before he can come good for us.

Mind you - I think he most definitely can, he has the potential.

But as of now, him coming back to the squad would give us nothing additional. It's hilarious if you think about it. Each time Holtby did play for us, 90% of the fans here always said, ""I love Holtby but he has to do more than run around and ""TRY"" hard."" - and now all of a sudden he's the most missed player?

&gt; but the matter of the fact is that he needs 2-3 years of development in the English league before he can come good for us.
Mind you - I think he most definitely can, he has the potential.

Hes getting a good run of games for Fulham and is doing really well.. I think that he could play a decent part for us next season.

As far as Tim being manager - I agree. We have a manager who could stay here for 10+ years, and we need that. We need stability. If he can to improve every match and consistently keep us around the top with a severely underperforming and seemingly disinterested squad then I thin he could do very very well with a squad that has the guys he seeks with dedicated players.

In my opinion I think we should keep Tim and do an overhaul this summer. Get rid of the players that don't give their all - Capoue, Paulinho, Vertonghen, Lennon, Gomes, Friedel, and hope Dawson retires. Use that money to bring in one or two solid players that have heart and will inspire our boys - Pirlo has been mentioned - and then bring up youth for the rest. Tim has great rapport with the youth sides and seems to know exactly when to promote youth and how to mold them.

His comments about players having guts explains his constant selection of Bentaleb IMO. Bentaleb is one of the few who plays with all his heart, and you can see it on the pitch. Get 6-7 players like that, a couple calm and collected players like Dembele and Eriksen, and throw in a leader to inspire like Pirlo and you have a great team.

We need to rebuild next year. This year has been a sacrifice. It's growing pains. We need to accept the loss and move on. Next year we are going to try something new, probably with several new players, and it will be tough.

Pellegrini has 1 substitution left and decides to go for it all. Off comes Martin Demichelis who has had a quiet game, but the board isn't displaying the player being subbed on. 

Uwe is standing there patiently, not minding the time being wasted as he knows it is to his team's advantage. Everyone stands patiently awaiting to see the green numbers, players and fans alike. 

Then, in a moment of absolute madness, Uwe turns around and clotheslines his assistant manager, and upon standing over his body, begins to strip down, revealing the famous sky blue kit he has been wearing underneath his suit all along. He slowly jogs out towards the Wigan 18 yard box while everyone stands in absolute shock. Wigan fans in the stands of the Etihad are furious. City fans are dumbfounded.

The referee blows the whistle to resume play, and Uwe immediately gains control of the ball before hammering home a wonderstrike from 40yds out that hits the underside of the bar before crossing the line. City win 1-0. Pellegrini and Uwe hug. They have been playing the long con for months to exact revenge for last year's Cup final defeat. Uwe immediately re-retires from playing football at the end of the match and is never seen or heard from again in England.

Also this line-up is really lacking the balance and grit Milner brings; he should really be starting a match like this.

1. The Orange Order was from its inception nearly 200 years ago set up deliberately as a sectarian instrument of British colonial domination in Ireland. The Order was exclusively Protestant, pro-British and rabidly anti-Catholic. The British colonial authorities fomented the Order and its vicious sectarianism as a way of driving a wedge between the communities and in particular to subjugate the rebellious Irish.   

2. Every year, the pro-British Orangemen would march through the mainly Catholic nationalist villages, towns and areas of Belfast in a demonstration of the second-class status that the native Irish were assigned by the British authorities.  

3. One of the popular songs of hatred sung by the Orangemen has the lyrics “We’re up to our knees in Fenian blood.”   

4. Here is another example of the depraved mentality of these Orange marches. In one mainly Catholic area of Belfast called the Lower Ormeau a group of five unarmed men in a sporting office was slaughtered by a British paramilitary death squad in 1992. In subsequent years when the Orange marchers would parade past the Catholic residents, the Orangemen would in unison raise their arms with five fingers pointed at the households and neighbors of the murdered men. That was meant as a sickening degradation of that community aimed to demonstrate British-state-sanctioned superiority of the Orangemen.

9 out of 10 new companies fail within the first three years has long been the mantra of start-ups.  Some including this as a factor isn't really news.  It's how it is.  It is also why everyone who's self employed says there is no shame in it.  There are also often tax advantages to shutting down a business after say a year, often due to good reasons, rather than bad ones.

So most of your links come from a guy called Mike Sivier, I can't help but feel he has an axe to grind, as there is zero evidence for his claims.

The BBC is the only remotely useful one of out of the bunch.  Even then the claims make little sense to me.  They suggest that it is somehow dodgy to suggest that she would still pay herself for 16 hours a week of work during the off season.  What the hell?  That is important good advice, you should always keep working capital in your small company and pay yourself the minimum you can afford to live on, taking the extra only when you are sure you won't need it.

Its harder to protest things when buying a meal out (say, if you're out on the street all day standing holding signs) can cost half of your week's budget and the same for travel; when you're living on a measly loan not a grant and whatever savings you can scrape up; all the while mentally tired from the heavy-duty research and high-precision tasks you're paying an institution to let you do.

Nuclear is much, much safer than public opinion believes. It is almost impossible for a modern plant to suffer a catastrophic melt-down; outside of some kind of natural disaster, absolute worst case scenario, boron dust gets dumped into the reactor chamber and shuts the whole thing right down, practically instantly. So, absolute worst case, utterly catastrophic scenario: you have to completely refit the reactor chamber. That's it. We've come a *long* way from Chernobyl.

Frankly, I have no idea why you don't think it's economical. We've been busy buying nuclear power off the French for years, do you think they've been subsidising us or something?

Cleaning up and decommissioning? The thing about power plants is that they don't really have a set lifespan. They're not made out of bits of rotting wood, they're made out of concrete; as long as you have regular inspections and renovate them every couple of decades, they'll keep going pretty much forever, if you want them to.

Where does the fuel come from? [Try googling it.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_mining) So, a lot of it comes from Canada and Australia. Those famously lawless, corrupt nations. As for enrichment plants, well, the UK has already got them, so it's probably a bit late to worry about it now.

As for the whole 'nobody is really responsible for them' thing, that's a bizarre fantasy. I have no idea where you got the idea that nuclear fission is some kind of Wild West industry; it's regulated to shit by every nation that has them (with the possible and worrying exception of Russia), and the UN keeps tabs on top of that. It's much better regulated and controlled than pretty much any other industry, anywhere, in fact, for obvious reasons.

I realise I'm coming across as a bit offensive, but you don't seem to have any connection to the reality of the situation. It's not the 1950s any more, radiation isn't this terrifying new invisible monster, and nuclear fission isn't a worrying new scientific frontier. It's 2014. Nuclear fission is really, really, *really* old hat, and we've got very good at doing it safely and efficiently. Sure, it requires a chunk of initial investment, but it pays that off surprisingly quickly. As for the rest of your comments, they're just bizarre.

1) This could be said to be a case of classic denial of child sexuality; she admits to instigating it; he should not maybe have been hounded so much by the press and treated like a paedophile and a creep and taking advantage of her. It could be argued that if she was persistent and as the teacher he could not 'escape' from contact with her and not see her, she should take some of the blame; and she wasnt suddenly going to become an adult when she hit 16

However:

2) The law is the law, and if they were serious about the attraction and the relationship, they should have waited until she was 16. As an adult especially, he should have known better, and if she seriously cared, she should also have known better. It was foolish to do what they did, no matter who's idea it was.

Also, its a bit odd how laid back the parents are about this relationship! Although the newspaper's obviously trying to push the 'teacher' angle to make a story out of it, about the new teaching assistant (isnt that like a special needs assistant or something) which I think is probably unfair to the man.

I tell you, I'm at university, and it hurts, man. It hurts to see these unpaid internships going, because you can't afford to do them. Unless you're from a rich family, you can't afford to do ANYTHING at university. I've worked all my life before this; part-time jobs, summer jobs, all that. I'd love to have an internship this summer, but I'm struggling to find a paid one. Yeah, it's great to get experience, but we live in a society where most people; (I'm guessing) 50-60% at least work to live. It just...it astounds me. That an unpaid internship can be a thing. Most people; and this may be a surprise to you, and I don't mean it offensively, but most people rely on the month's pay packet or the one beyond that to get them through to the next week.

When I finish uni for the summer, I have a month to find work. I'm probably going to have to take some time out beforehand to look for work; because if I don't find a decent job, I still need to pay my rent, which will mean working a shit job like I did last summer; (£30 a day for 12 hour days) or selling my stuff. That's all there is to it, for a lot of people.

There really is a huge, huge gap nowadays. But as well, I think if you paid someone a minimum wage or a living wage; that person would appreciate it. I don't know if you care about making friends (or allies, whatever) in the field you work in, but the person would truly be grateful.

Because, so many employers don't want to help. Theyre fine going just to rich people, keeping the status quo, keeping the rich minority in jobs and power. Maybe they don't even realise they're doing it, realise how little a lot of people have these days. It's tough man. But it's your call, ultimately. I think it'd be cool to help someone out.

Like, just pure commissions seems risky and to be smacks of a weak business if they can't afford to pay you NMW and I'd never take a commission only job unless I was rich enough to afford to do so. Just generally (to me) this seems unstable and I'd be looking while working there for another job that was stable income. 

But then, for what sounds like it's quite a demanding job *just* NMW seems a bit low and as someone else mentioned, seems a bit like they're just working for you to make money. Which is fair enough I guess if you're open about it and that's the environment. 

But having said that I'm probably a bit fussy and have a fairly strong skill set behind me, so while I'm only young I can afford to be a bit fussy with jobs.

While those situations may not be ideal, the original problem is absolutely and without question our midfield. We have absolutely zero fluidity through the midfield and could not be more predictable. Our true CM's in Dembele, Paulinho, and Bentaleb are all entirely too similar in that they are constantly looking for the horizontal ball and almost never vertically through the attacking third. We have no one who can pick up the ball from the CDM and back line, and with pace get the ball to the CAM, wingers, and striker. Our wingers are also entirely too predictable. We pass out wide, the wingers are incapable of picking out a pass because opposing managers easily instruct their players to quickly double the winger, and our attack is already fizzled out and we're forced to reset if we even hold on to possession. Because we often lose the ball with this format, our back line problems are exposed more often than they should be. 

We desperately need a new LW and possibly a true CM of athleticism, grit, and drive to get the ball forward. Paulinho isn't enough. He puts an incredibly small fraction of the effort he puts into Brazil into his games in Lillywhite. It's a shocking disparity.

One would consistently leave the washing up in the sink and never do it, so we'd have to do it, and would order takeaways on the two occasions we tried leaving the dirty dishes in front of her door (after putting the dirty stuff back in the kitchen sink), One would never replace the toilet paper after using a shitload of it (pun not intented) and the guy in the room next to me used to practise martial arts moves with a staff (broomhandle) at 6 in the morning.

true,beard-maketh-the-man,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"What you read about US prisons might be correct.

From what I've read over the years, there are many federal prisons that are nothing short of brutal.  So many of their prisons basically produce animals and when they're released they have no chance.  Justice in the US seems more about retribution rather than rehabilitation.  But that doesn't help society when you've got someone with PTSD leaving prison and released back into the community.

Over here, sure there is violence, although it's mostly fighting (extreme violence does happen - an inmate was murdered at one of my family members prisons not long ago.  I'll ask this evening what it was about, but when I asked not long ago, they thought it was linked to a feud that was already brewing outside of prison.)

There is a racial / cultural dived much like there is in a lot of workplaces across the UK.  But in general it's not like what you see on American TV shows (OZ, justified, ermmm and others. . . where there are blacks, Mexicans, aryan nation etc).  That said, the worse the prison, the more likely there is to be these divides.  When we treat people like animals, they will act like them.

Things like rape are a massive issue in the US.  Over here, it does happen, but on a much smaller scale.  I know rape is all about power, but in the UK it's still ""a bit gay"".

Most people in prison are just normal people that got caught doing something illegal (some crimes are morally wrong, some aren't).  In one of my families prison, the vast majority are in there for drug dealing.  It's understandable.  I work a minimum wage job and earn about £7000 a year (pathetic I know).  I know full well, I could set up a small cannabis grow easily earn that much, so I can see why it's more than tempting for people to start doing it.  After all, people enjoy drugs.  There will never not be a demand for them.

From what I've listened to over the years, my understanding is that in general, most people just keep their head down.  After all, what's the point in being a total cunt?  They're all locked up, but at least it's clean, they have meals, they can take advantage of things like education and  training (sadly, another thing that's being slashed) and we don't treat them like total animals.

true,Aeiedil,eng-kent,Kent,"I share a house with a couple of others, of which 1 is the owner.  I have previously house/flat shared a few other times, and generally it's worked out well enough.

Key points + issues to look out for

1 : Bills - in my current case these are included in my rent and so there's no issue with chasing up contributions.  In a previous share though the bills were split between 4 people and it was a nightmare to look after.  If you can get an arrangement which includes bills in your rent, it's 1 less issue to cause contention down the line.

2 : Cleaning - Some people will undoubtedly clean more than others, or have different standards of cleaning, or prefer different frequencies etc.  This has caused the most arguments in any house share between all involved.  At the end of the day, the best you can do is to clean up after yourself as you should be doing really anyway (in particular bathroom if shared and of course the kitchen)

3 : Repairs - There are things that need repairing but this is an issue shared with renting in general.  A positive of having the landlord being within the houseshare is that if, for example, heating fails then it affects him directly and so it has proven so far to result in far faster repairs than when I've been a tenant elsewhere.

4 : Privacy - This shouldn't really be an issue but potentially can be.  I've got a nice amount of space that's outside of the communal house area as do others in the house.  So long as people respect others private areas then it's fine and so far this hasn't proved to be a problem.

5 : Cost - It's far cheaper than renting or buying.  That's about all there is to say on that.  Currently I'm paying approximately what I would spend on bills/subscriptions etc if I had my own house in the area that I'd like and so there's no point buying / renting elsewhere from a purely financial point of view as I would still have the outlay I currently have, but with additional for rent/mortgage.

6 : Social - This can be a good or a bad thing.  Generally I go on the side of it being positive that, especially for a single person like myself, it's nice to have others in the house.  You of course might not always get on with your housemate and all that, but if you do then it can be nice to have them around.  You don't get that if you're renting on your own.  Having a roast dinner on sundays is certainly nicer when it's for more than just yourself.

Overall, I'm happy in this house-share in general.  In the long run I am potentially going to look at buying, however with my current arrangement I have freedom to move if circumstances change.  All in all, it's hard to really justify buying just yet when I'm not quite in a position to consider myself settled.

There will be pros and cons, and as with anything in life your experience may vary.  If you take care to evaluate both the house and the people in it though, then a house share will cut your bills and potentially give you a nice house to live in with a social aspect to it.

I hope this rambling text is of use - if you have any questions feel free to ask.

true,jazimov,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottingham,"Inequality is a direct objective of a capitalist. Your goal is always to employ someone such that you can take as much of the surplus away from the products of their labour as possible. It that this can be done in a nice way, you simply cannot survive in a competitive market if you do not have this mindset.

The valuable rights we have; a right to paid holidays, maternity/paternity leave, safer working conditions, tax funded healthcare and so much more that we literally just take for granted, are violently opposed by a capitalist mode of thought because *every single one of these things reduces the amount of surplus that a capitalist can extract*. It is beyond naivety to think otherwise.

The idea of a happy medium is not compatible with a good capitalist; it must be opposed because there is always another, more ruthless, capitalist to compete who will probably win, given sufficient amount of time. Opposition to capitalist excess will never come from within,  any compromise to the extraction of surplus must come from an external force that is very willing to destroy it if the capitalists are not willing to settle. These are all products of Socalist movements willing to fight for much much more.

Today we are virtually powerless. We do not need a movement that should not fight for a middle ground, perhaps we should be willing to make concessions that genuinely improve peoples lives in the short term, but the only way capitalism will ever be constrained is if it has no other choice than to exist inside constraints. I find the notion of fighting for some middle ground to be a bit of a joke - maybe we have to settle because we don't want a civil war, but there should always be a line we are not willing to cross, something we will literally die to protect if it is worth that. Otherwise the capitalists will have won, because they never want to have to compromise and they will turn up to the negotiating table willing to bully anyone into submission.

true,mosestrod,null,null,"&gt;However I think it's very much a case of hypocrisy from the Stop the War coalition to find reasons to dismiss the Russian invasion. 

perhaps, as I said I think the original analysis was correct and that the Stop the War coalition does have this problem. However when I watch the news I'm a lot more anti-western purely because I see largely correct criticisms of Russia’s imperialism, but a complete ignorance of western imperialism. In an abstract sense we should treat both equally, but in a very real sense we live in the UK, and they aren't treated equally, the favour here is for the west. So our criticism must place the west in correct relation to Russia, Russia which in our nations discourse is placed in broadly the correct geopolitical position. 

&gt;It seems to me that this shows more of a general anti-Western ethos as opposed to an anti-War ethos.

I don't think these are mutually exclusive. The problem here is your assumption that we should just automatically support western states, and I think that kind of mentality is what generates Stop the War Coalition et al. focusing a lot more on 'our', or western, crimes. I think being anti-west is fine, and actually very healthy. Of course it depends what you mean by 'west', I support the people who live in western nations, I don't, a priori, support western governments and states who have a horrible history.

&gt; You say it's a voice of big business but they often lambast big businesses.

As I would expect them to. Someone who criticised the military and argues how it can be improved or what things should be changes isn't against the military, in fact they prove themselves as greater and more committed supporter – practical or strategic disagreement is **not** the same as ideological disagreement. This is the same with the economist vis-a-vie the business class.

&gt;However in their main articles they are upfront with the facts and what is their opinion of that facts

The facts are most obvious from their exclusion. My friend subscribes to the Economist and we can predict, *par excellence*, what the Economists opinions will be on every current topic, for we just assume the mentality of the businessman. Like all the best propaganda they don't lie, their facts are accurate, propaganda occurs on what facts they choose to include. I think the Economist is useful to judge the general mood and attitude of big business towards certain events and processes.

&gt;I think the idea of a uniform 'business class' is a gross simplification of The Economists editorial position and society in general. 

No one has that idea though. The idea of a business class, like with any other class, is never one of homogeneity, but of generally shared interests. This doesn't mean there aren't conflicts, disputes, ideological disagreements, but they are all contained within broadly shared interests and points of view. For example you won't get businessmen arguing over whether the means of production should be taken into collective ownership, but you will get arguments over emerging markets, intellectual property rights, the EU etc. For those are real issues that the business class must, in various ways, solve and negotiate is they are to maintain and reproduce themselves.

true,w0ss4g3,cnty-wales,Not Welsh but I live here,"The way I've read your original post, that is at least partly what you were suggesting. In your description, you specifically mentioned answering phones and work on lead generation (as well as other sales related tasks). That is labour, and I don't believe it falls within the remit of a trainee.

If you mean that you're going to spend 3 months training someone to man a phone and attempt sales then I think that's ridiculous. I'd imagine a week of explaining things to the person, followed by a tapered off supervision would be all that's required. Fact is, they're at the place of work and their time should be compensated.

In my experience, companies who are ""training"" people for this kind of thing will always take the person on a temporary basis and then they will be offered a permanent position once they have demonstrated an ability (some may stay on a temporary basis if they want).

Finally, If I were looking for work and I was offered a job where I was told I *might* be given money to cover my expenses (travel/food/living) but without any explicit amount given, then I'd be very wary of working for you.

Someone with less experience may well hear you giving the possibility of expenses and think that it is definite, or have much higher expectations on the amounts you will cover. This could lead to a breakdown in your working relationship and end up wasting both your time and theirs. It seems a lot wiser to have things written down and definite so that no one can be disappointed or confused by things.

As others have said: If you can't afford to pay someone a liveable wage then I'd hold off until you can.

I can afford to do it for the probationary period i'm just fearful of doing so and even with all my best intentions hire the wrong person for the role who'll want to do the bare min for the wage and then just waste my time, money and energy on a nonstarter. 

And thanks for your POV, it's certainly helped having the collective responses of many.

I don't trust the people who say it's safe. I don't trust the people who are responsible for stating the costs. 

Canada and Australia are as corrupt as any other countries. How can I trust what you say when you sound so naive? 

The corporations that operate nuclear facilities, and other dangerous industries show themselves over and over to be untrustworthy, to be liars and to give not a damn about the consequences of their behaviour and they take no responsibility for messes they make. 

As I understand it, the profits from nuclear benefit the corporations and the costs are borne by the public purse. 

Since I don't have the background to do full research on the matter, I would rather not support further involvement in this industry. I am reliant on sources that sound credible on the matter and I favour those who are doubtful that this is a responsible way to supply power. 

You are not at all credible based on your obvious naivte. The economy is going down the toilet. Talk of recovers is very obviously propaganda disseminated by governments. If you believe any such thing, I doubt your good sense.

I am living on a planet being destroyed by pollution. I am living on a planet where people lie about the consequences of their activities in order to get wealth and power. I am living on a planet where industry pays scientists to lie about the damage they do. I am living on a planet where sufficient numbers of people will do something very dangerous for short term gain and not think twice about future generations paying. I am living on a planet where a small percentage of people live a very good life at the expense of the rest.

Sure, there's little things like people not taking the bin out, pissing on the toilet rim or pots not being washed.  But I think a part of making a house run smoothly is accepting that and just dealing with it.

For example, if I'm washing my own pots up and there's somebody elses, I'll clean them too.  A little bit of give and take.  Obviously if someone is taking the piss, you need to call them out on it sooner rather than later.

""Asked whether his link to the England job was affecting Spurs' players, Redknapp said: ""[That's] the biggest load of nonsense I've ever heard in my life. **They don't care whether I'm the manager next year, they wouldn't lose any sleep over that.

true,devineman,logo,,"It's one aspect of it.  Demichelis doesn't continuously make mistakes, he's just going through a sticky patch of form which everybody does.  His mistakes are highlighted though as we play a higher line than most and (to an extent) the English press already dislike him when Lescott is on the bench.  I'm much more concerned about Negredo if I'm honest than I am Demichelis.

If I did have a problem with Demichelis it's that he's a square peg in a round hole in terms of distribution.  Pellegrini asks both of our centre backs to be a bit more direct in passing at times to start off counter attacking situations and I don't think Demi has the range of passing to do this which results in him trying something ambitious and giving the ball away.  I'm pleased however that he's still trying it; it would be very easy for him to shrink into himself like Nastasic did and play everything as safe as possible in spite of the job he is asked.  Instead he always tries to play for the team at the cost of personal ridicule which I respect in a professional footballer.  In fact, I greatly respect this and admire the character it demands.

I don't think he's as slow as people make out, and he's faster than Lescott.  His problem is that he lacks agility to swivel his hips quickly enough to turn and his speed of thought is slower than I think it should be.  The Barca game is a great example of this.  Many people actually forget that he completely shut Messi down for the entire game until that tackle where he went off, and on occasion beat him in a straight race.  His straight line speed and his acceleration over 15 yards is just not the issue it is made out to be.

I think he's good in the air, in particularly when he's competing one on one, and he's confident enough to bring it down to feet and move 5 yards with it.  There's a good reason why he has played in midfield for both us and Bayern Munich; he is good on the ball when not asked to execute passes obviously outside of his range.  He's also got a bit of a shot on him that we rarely see.

Mostly though, I think his positioning is very good and by far his biggest attribute.  Many of his ""mistakes"" come from other defenders not getting into position which leaves Demi to be the focal point in cleaning up with a 5 yard gap which is why people think he's ""slow"".  I think he's very good at showing attackers wide , I think he's very good at standing up well/knowing when to commit and I think he's very good in staying composed and organised during high pressure attacking.

Again, the man competes for hundreds of challenges and people judge him on about three that isn't reflective of his overall game.  They also use a highly convenient memory, Kompany went through a period of making a mistake every couple of games too last year.  The difference here seems to be in media attention and thus neutral fan attention.

I think Demichelis is one of those people that we can potentially upgrade and if we presume a simple Rekik for Lescott straight swap, Demi will probably be Kompany's rotation rather than next to him with AN Other to come in.

Another point to raise here is that Demi is average for City.  He'd walk into many teams.

    x = MarketCap / Employees

In those firms I would argue that listening to just some employees voices isn't really the best idea, as those which require such market cap require extreme investment over a considerable period of time.  The people who have provided that surely have a right to say where the company should be going.

The best way to of course solve this, is by having good employee mobility.

However, a few years after my husband and I bought our first house together we ended up sharing again for a while and that was a very different story. 

I had to take a pay cut to go back to uni and retrain and so we decided to rent out the two spare rooms to help us with the mortgage until I finished my degree. The problem was that, to the people we shared with, our house was just somewhere temporary until they could afford their own place so they didn't feel any sense of responsibility not to fuck it up. To us it was our home and we actually gave a shit about it so it was frustrating when they broke our stuff, moved girlfriends/boyfriends in without asking, refused to clean up after themselves, started a small fire when drunk etc. 

If you can find housemates who are not only good company but also considerate and reliable then I can see how it could be fun. Unfortunately, we found that even people who you really like and enjoy spending time with can be a nightmare to live with.

&gt;8th Doctor to 9th Doctor: Who knows?

&gt;Ranking The Regenerations Of Doctor Who
&gt;
&gt;Since Russell T. Davies (wisely) began the revived series with Christopher Eccleston already in place as the Ninth Doctor, we still don't have any definitive idea as to the fate of the Eighth Doctor. Though there's a slight chance the second part of ""The End of Time"" might shed some light on the subject, this will likely remain unexplained for the foreseeable future. The closest thing I've ever found to an official word on the subject — and this takes a hell of a lot of digging to uncover — can be found buried deep within the archives of the old tie-in website ""Who Is Doctor Who?"", which was the first of a bunch of quickie websites the BBC created to promote the first series of new Doctor Who. If you click through to the ""Sightings"" page on the original incarnation of the website, you'll find this nugget:

&gt;Steven Hudson
""I saw him a couple a years ago outside a new building development in Totters Lane, East London. The guy seemed really confused and keep muttering, ""They're all gone, I'm the only one left"". The man was either a complete loon or was drunk. Looking back I think he was probably drunk as he looked as if he'd been to a fancy dress party. He was wearing some old Edwardian outfit, not a leather jacket.

&gt;So, if I may add 2 and 2 together to make 100, this obviously means the eighth Doctor regenerated right at the end of the Time War, in which he wiped out Daleks and Time Lords alike, and then the ninth Doctor went to Totters Lane in 2003 — exactly forty Earth years after his adventures began in that very same location! — to try and get his bearings while still wearing his predecessor's clothes. Obviously. Or we can just file all that away as massively non-canonical and move on.""",0,1394395813,null,0,1394395995,0,cfyeeer,t3_1zyarq,t1_cfyeeer,t1_cfy4y3l,null,1432727224,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

He needs a fantastic game where he's the best player on the pitch next to Aguero to get him firing again.

true,LordAnubis12,null,null,"I don't think there's any real solution to interviews as each has been different, but one of the key things really I've found useful was asking them questions. 

I once got a really good response from a job which I didn't take (retail) and I think it was mostly because I just sat there and ended up interviewing the owner - taking apart every part of their business plan, how are they going to do X, compete with X, differentiate from X etc. 

I was really interested how they were going to do XYZ, and it was a fresh start up so it helped that I wanted to know both out of genuine interest, but also because it was a big risk and investment from me if I took the job. I think this came across that I was just a drone and I was only going to take the job if I liked it and that frankly, they had to convince me to take it because I knew I was good enough. 

Obviously this won't help everyone and it's a contextual situation, but I do think that asking questions about the people and the business (Do you like your job here, what are company plans in the next year etc) shows a genuine interest and will really help with the job. 

I've never been that nervous in interviews, obviously a bit but I think asking questions helps as for me it made me feel like I was more in control which thus calmed some nerves. Telling people how amazing you are might work, but I feel like your friend probably just got lucky. I've only really worked in smaller organisations but don't think that would fly with them, at least not long term. I was a bit intense with my questions in above interview, but having a few to ask a long the way helps I think and makes you seem less generic. 

I know if I was an employer if I was interviewing someone with a perfect CV, but then just answered the questions in a too generic way, I'd hire the person with actual personality and interest in the job. I am, however, not an employer so this could be bull shit ;)

For example, as a student in student accommodation I watch BBC programming for free on the internet. A subscription could give me a means cheaper than the licence fee where I could affordably pay for live TV and catch-up. They could also set up an additional subscription package, called BBC+ or something, that gets you instant uploads of programmes and the BBC catalogue of all its past programming, that lots of people want to watch.

Also, instead of just requiring a simple licence fee, the university that pays the standard price per TV could have to pay a much higher corporate fee, as having BBC TV would become a selling point, much like having sports channels at a pub.

In addition to this, their news content they do could remain free to air and paid for by general taxation. Same with their radio programming and all the other public services they do. **The BBC as a public service could remain free to everyone and well supported.

This went on for two years, then I got a job in London and as things were moving quickly, I just contracted an agency to slot me into a houseshare as I needed a cheap place to live (and seeing as I was 150 miles away at the time, I couldn't afford the luxury of taking the time to view places on a whim etc)

This period of my life was awful to be honest. The houseshare was full of people who didn't talk to one another and the agency kept on air-dropping new people in as others left. I hated having to share a house again too, as I was used to having my own place, my own things and my own kitchen to take care of and enjoy. People used to leave dirty pots and pans everywhere, steal food from others and generally keep out of everyone's way.

I became depressed over this and became a bit of a hermit. Thankfully I got promoted at work so I could move out and get my own flat again and I've been living here happily for nearly 3 years now.

It can get lonely, but everything in here is mine. I worked for it and no one can take it away from me, I can choose who I have over to stay or entertain and I maintain the responsibility to clean it without having to rely on others.

&gt; *My reaction was I wanted to be treated in Germany, but my doctor said, ‘No, Uwe, you have to go in now or you won’t survive past Easter*

&gt; *From believing I had, at worst, a chest infection, I was now being told that, as things stood, I had about a week to live. I needed to start ­chemotherapy immediately to have any chance at all.*

&gt; *I didn’t know which type of cancer was specific to my tumour, but I did know two of them are deadly while the third is the most aggressive, but curable, if you catch it at the right time and the cancer has not spread.*

&gt; Rosler’s gruelling battle included intravenous chemotherapy, radiotherapy and a series of bone marrow ­injections.

&gt;But during one course of treatment, he took the call which gave his recovery a rocket boost.

&gt; *My mobile phone began to ring as I came out of a listless sleep. With wires in my arm, I was in my hospital bed ­recovering from the latest dose of ­chemotherapy and I barely had the strength to lift the handset.*

&gt; *I picked it up and saw the name of an old friend from Manchester, Mark Buckley, displayed on the screen.*

&gt; *He said, Uwe, can you hear it? Listen to this...*

&gt; *He held his phone at arm’s length and I realised my friend was calling from the City of Manchester Stadium. The City fans were singing my name, and I could hear it echoing around the ground.*

&gt; *They were willing me to beat the cancer and they had not given up on me.*

&gt; *I ended the call and smiled for the first time in a long while. It was exactly what I needed.*

&gt;*I had my wife, sons, family and close friends helping me. Now I had 46,000 Mancunians willing me back to health.*

&gt; *With that kind of backing, how could I possibly fail?*

&gt; *It was incredibly uplifting. I can’t express how much that meant.*

&gt; *If I had a bond to the club [before], it became unbreakable at that moment and it’s something I’ll never forget.*

&gt; *Cards and telegrams started to arrive from City fans. I read each and every one, and I have kept them. It steeled my resolve to return one day and thank the City fans myself.*

&gt;Rosler had only begun the long haul back towards rude health when City asked him to take a bow as their VIP guest at a home game.

&gt;*It had been a very exhausting few months, which I would not wish on anybody* said the 44-year-old in his ­autobiography, Knocking Down Walls.

&gt;*But, gradually, I began to regain my strength. Around then I received an ­invitation from City to fly over, all expenses paid, and say hello to the supporters at half-time.*

&gt;*I was very weak, but I couldn’t let the City fans down. I was sweating and shaking, but when I walked on the pitch, the whole stadium gave me a standing ovation. Once again, those fans had given me a jump-start when I needed it most.*

true,jimicus,eng-somerset,"Where your aunt, your sister and your mum are the same person.","Ah, the Creature Wot Lived by the Stairs. Where do I begin?

I shall call him Dave, for that was his name.

Dave was a chap in his 40s - he had studied philosophy many years previously and eventually concluded it wasn't a particularly good subject for a lucrative career. So he went back to college in order to study the repair and maintenance of aircraft. A somewhat stressful career, mostly taught (and for that matter studied) by ex-RAF fitters who wanted to adapt their experience for a career working on civilian airliners.

Not, in short, the sort of profession that has much patience for idiots.

In order to fund this, he'd sold a flat he owned and was left with £20,000 or so. Into our student house, he brought a tumble dryer and a set of disgusting habits. Most of them were fairly standard grim-student fare of the sort we all know; there were some nastier habits that I'll come to later.

Those habits included:

 - Never cleaning anything. Ever.
 - Seldom showering. He could be smelled from some distance away.
 - Curious dietary habits. Prior to meeting this chap, I had no idea that you could purchase frozen doner kebabs. Nor did I know you could buy tinned food simply labelled ""Dinner"", containing mystery meat in mystery gravy. 
 - Curious conversational habits. On learning that one of our housemates was a nurse, he asked for her advice regarding his haemorrhoids. She foolishly mentioned that he was a little young to suffer from these, to which he explained a fondness for asking prostitutes to fuck him up the arse with a strap-on. 
 - Curious recreational habits. Many of us have experimented with soft drugs at university, but seldom went much farther than a bit of cannabis. Dave was different. He decided to go straight for crack cocaine.
 - Curious sexual habits. There's nothing wrong with wanting a healthy sex life - it's something we all desire. Dave decided the easiest way to arrange this was to chase after under-age prostitutes. This was something Dave was quite proud of - he just wanted to have fun, he didn't care if he caught AIDS. Needless to say, this combined with his drugs habit burned through his £20,000 in fairly short order and attracted the attention of the local constabulary. Apparently they frown on fucking 14 year olds and smoking crack.

Consider that since the 00/01 season our average finishing position is 8th(7.7), in the same time period Everton's average finishing position is 9th (8.7). Each of us have appeared in the CL once in that time period. In the past 5 years we have averaged finishing in 5th and Everton has averaged finishing in 7th (6.6). That's a pretty remarkable similarity between the two clubs in terms of where we finish.

Basically we already are on the same level as Everton, what we are trying to do...what the club tells us and the expectations that are told to us is to move up from the 5-10 range to the 1-4 range in the table.

The issue is the 1-4 range is pretty damn difficult to get into especially when you have City, Chelsea and United (who are going to spend a ton this summer) outspending everyone and then Arsenal with the most stable club around and (as much as i utterly loathe the man with every fiber of my being) a pretty damn good coach and LFC will be trying to make sure that they make the CL consistently again.  Throw into the mix a team like Everton who will jump up now and then and compete and the upper reaches of the league is extremely difficult to crack. 

It is hard to crack the top 4 consistently if you don't spend cash, have a great manager or both. We don't spend like Chelsea, City or United and we don't have a manager on par with Chelsea, City, Arsenal or LFC. 

So that means we can either temper our expectations and be happy that the club is now in a slot where at least we are in conversation for CL competition. Or we can move to push up which means spending money  or getting a great coach.",0,1394400526,null,0,false,0,cfygdrw,t3_1zyji8,t1_cfygdrw,t1_cfye7zu,null,1432728475,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

Just because there are two opposing sides does not mean there is an equality in terms of who is stirring shit up. The OO is a sectarian, supremacist and anti-catholic organisation which insists upon marching through Catholic areas. Why are they to blame rather than republicans? Because there is no green equivalent. I'm not saying there aren't Catholic religious cults which don't admit protestants. But they don't go marching through Protestant areas proclaiming some kind of superiority over the opposing side. If there was a green equivalent which did that on any comparable scale - then I could happily say that it's an even handed problem between both communities. But it's not. Yes there are republican bands who parade, but where do they parade generally speaking? Do they have a regular, annual desire to march en masse through areas they are unwelcome? And that's what this stupid loyalist camp thing at Twaddell is all about. The primary antagonists in civil disorder in Belfast and further afield are not republicans - they're loyalists. People should just call a spade a spade rather than contrive this bogus, neutral position.

This is tricky - because what you've described isn't really an internship. Its more of a ""try before you buy"". If your intern wanted to push it they could get you in a lot of trouble for not paying them if the job is as described. And that doesn't just extend to paying them a wage (which you've said you will) it also means provision of tax, NI, employer contributions, workplace insurances etc.

Effectively an intern is someone who is employed for a fixed period of time on a **training basis**. It is not purely to gain experience as the term is generally taken to mean. So you cannot employee that person in ""service provision"" aspects of your business. i.e. if they are providing essential services then they are more likely to be classed as an employee by the government, regardless of what you call them or advertised for.

Basically, **[have a read of this](https://www.gov.uk/employment-rights-for-interns)**. Your idea isn't terrible, it just needs some fairly substantial reconsidering and adjusting to fit in with the law.

In my personal opinion, if you a person of non-white ethnicity but you were born and raised in Britain then you have just as much a right to scream ""British pride"" as someone who's family has been on the island since 1066. Hell, as long as you identify as being British you can have British pride. 

Those two groups also falsely equate patriotism with nationalism. Patriotism is being proud of where you're from, nationalism is saying that where you're from is better than everywhere else. The BNP/EDL often say, ""We just want to show our pride for being English/British."" That by itself is fine, but the way they go about doing it is by attacking other non-British people and cultures. That's when their perverted acts of patriotism spill over into nationalism.

I think in general, the manifestation and handling of confidence is mostly tied to your culture, based both on how you were raised and where you're living now.

I don't really know much about where Vertonghen comes from, but he was a very important player at Ajax and we've seen what winning means to him. He's extremely passionate and maybe too much so at times.

The scouting staff will say who they're aware of that fits that description and that might be available, while Ayre tells them whether we can afford him. One of the jobs of scouts is finding out whether players can be signed, and at what cost. Once they've said ""player X is available for somewhere between £12m-18m"", it's Ayre's job to sign the player for as little as possible. The TC probably decides they don't want to pay more than Y (say £15m) and if we can't get the player for less, we look at other options.

Essentially, it's lots of people to-ing and fro-ing to get the best players we can for the money we've got.

Winning at OT, still in title race, 9 points over Spurs, 14 points over mancs. It isn't lacking, what is the point of adding something that we won't care about the day after.
Losing:
Might drop back to 4th, only 6 points ahead of spurs, loss of 3 points etc.

I have the £12 goody bag, been on it since December 2012, all was good until September 2013, my signal was all over the place, 3G dropping out etc it steadied itself around December 2013, but since early January I've been stuck on gprs, it's just ultra slow. 3G comes and goes, it's better now than it was in January. 

I posted on the forums and all I ever got was the same copy &amp; pasted answers because you get payback points for posting, so people just spam with generic solutions for free credit. I contacted giffgaff themselves and got the same generic response, I told them that I've tried literally everything, new sim, checked the O2 service website, reset my phone etc, and they just reeled off all the solutions that I've tried, like they'd not even bothered to read my complaint. I contacted O2 directly about faults with masts, they said they can't help me because I'm actually a giffgaff customer. I asked Apple if it was a phone fault and the diagnostics suggest it's not. Dunno why my signal has dropped to nothing, the only thing I can think is that it all happened at the same time as 4G was switched on in my area. 

It really used to be good, if I can get that reliable data connection back I'd give them a lot more praise, I used to use around 10gb a month though streaming TV and Netflix, now I barely use 3gb because it never works. So yeah, customer service is nonexistent, but if you can get signal then it's probably a good move. I'm looking at switching to 3 because their unlimited data (very similar bundle as the giffgaff one) is only £12.90, for 90p extra its worth it for a more reliable connection and actual customer support if I need it.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Been in shared households for the past 6 years. In that time I've been in 5 different shared households in a variety of financial circumstances. I can't say anymore than the general experience is hit-and-miss. i've never been fortunate enough to move in with my friends like many people do (I'm not lonely I just don't have friends who have rooms going very often) so it's always been with random people. One thing I've learned is first impressions are a shitty way to judge people but you always do it. You meet people you'll be living with and you never get them right. The people you think you'll hate you end up loving and the people you think you'll love you end up hating. At this point in time, when I'm attempting to rent a spare room, I simply judge them on how stable they appear during the viewing. People put up a front they never stick to when they first meet people.

When it's good you live with people who you genuinely look forward to just sitting and chatting with on a Tuesday night about nothing, using obscure in-jokes and references no one else could possibly understand. I once lived with a guy who I became really good friends with. i remember when I'd come home from work and go into the kitchen he'd come in. At the start he'd pretend to prepare something then I called him on it then he admitted ""I just enjoy talking to you, so when I hear someone in the kitchen I come in to see if it's you"". Sadly our friendship fell apart for stupid reasons and I moved abroad for a year, I've not seen him since but I can tell you that year was one of the best of my life, just because I enjoyed being with him so much.

When it's bad, it's just awful. You'd be amazed the amount of unbelievably stupid people who live out there and the people who will go to any lengths to be anti-social assholes. I had one of these characters recently. She had no idea how to live by herself and she didn't have to because her mum came round on a weekly basis to help her out with stuff (her mum stayed the night a lot too, it was weird). I started off thinking she was shy so I kept inviting her out when I was going out with other housemates or just to come and watch TV with us. She said she'd think about it but she never left her room. Then I realized she never used the kitchen and found out later she had a fridge and microwave in her room just to avoid having to cook with the rest of the house. Shit really hit the fan when I attempted to add her on facebook and found she'd been posting complete BS about the rest of the house on her page. Stuff like ""OMG, that akward moment when you go to make a cup of tea and your creepy housemate is there. Think the bedroom door is getting locked tonight LOL"". Called her on it, she denied it, made up a long BS story about ""oh, my facebook is acting weird, that's an old status"". She refused to pay bills she didn't think she had to pay (the amount of times I had to explain to her what council tax was made me want to puke with rage). Eventually she left. We didn't know she'd left until the letting agent called us saying she'd not paid rent for that month. Opened the door to her room- empty. Called her- she hung up the moment she heard my voice.

I'm moving into a house with my partner at the end of the summer. I hope that'll be the end of my housemate adventures. It's not that I'm ungrateful for the experience. I wouldn't want to change a thing. I've got a couple of friends who've been living with their GFs since high school and you know what's happened to them? Absolutely nothing. It's dull. They have no stories to tell about living with other people. Life, imo, is a collection of experiences and living with other people can give you that. Though, the turbulence of it is just tiring and that's why I'm going to stop doing it. Then there is an issue of privacy and just wanting to have a place you can call your own.

No. 

AVB tried to play the hand he was dealt and heavy possession/slow build-up was the result. The problem was not AVB as much as the make-up of the team. We have too many strong, ball winning central midfield types and too few artful passing types who can split a team open or create a chance.

You only have to look at how we play with Eriksen to see it unfortunately. Maybe we pick up another playmaker type in the summer, i hope we don't, but it seems to me we *have* to lose some weight. We have too many of the same player - Pauli, Dembele, Sandro, Bentaleb etc etc.

I love my country, but there is a difference between being a nationalist and being patriotic. Nationalism is ""*an extreme form of patriotism marked by a feeling of superiority over other countries.*"" I don't feel that Britain is 'superior' just because we've contributed hugely to music, science, politics and whatever else you can imagine, and I don't think you should be proud of wherever you happened to have been born - it's not a personal achievement.

Eg. there isn't any serious racist component in English-speaking Canadian politics, so people generally regard Canadian pride with a smile. Frog-speaking Canada, while not really having racist parties still manages to have such stridently pro-poutine policies that Quebec pride is still derided. Germany had a very serious racist component to nationalism within the last 100 years, so being patriotic in Germany is seriously frowned upon - I have kraut friends born and raised in the 80's and 90's who get very uncomfortable at displaying even innocuous pride over things like their flag. Greece is probably headed there too in the near future. 

Britain unfortunately has a bunch of openly racist twats touting the banner of patriotism as a political platform, so that taints anyone else being patriotic (although I'd think still only really in Britain - most Americans wouldn't think there's anything wrong with a Briton being proud of his country, because they're not aware of British politics and race relations).

I'm not necessarily sure the BBC getting less money would be a bad thing, as it would mean the BBC could focus their programming on an audience who are specifically there for it.

From a lot of comments on here, as well as personal experience, it seems a lot of people who support paying the license fee prefer the more 'intellectual' programmes on the BBC, such as the documentaries or BBC 4. This suggests that the people who don't want to pay for the BBC prefer other channels, which tend to have less intellectual programmes on them. An example is my nan, who only watches Coronation Street and Emmerdale, and therefore doesn't want to pay the license fee, which I think is fair enough. 

This means that if the BBC did go subscription based, it would leave this core 'intellectual' audience, and lose the 'casual' audience (see what I mean about sounding a little pretentious). This means they could tailor their programmes to this audience, meaning more programmes I like, while spending a lower percentage of their budget on other programmes that were primarily a grab at the audience who moved away. 

This would hopefully also mean that the BBC could get a lot more independence, as they wouldn't have the threat of the government cutting funding if they say something the government don't like.

The popular star laced up his boots and took to the field in Sutton Coldfield for only the second time since his top-flight career was tragically cut short due to leukaemia in March 2012.

And in a match for his new charity The Stiliyan Petrov Foundation, set up to help others with leukaemia, the 34-year-old rolled back the years by scoring from the spot at the Boldmere St Michael’s pitch in Church Lane, Sutton Coldfield.

He was joined on the field by a host of Villa legends.

Paul Merson, Alan Wright and Julian Joachim signed up for the Petrov XI, while former favourites from the 1980s European Cup winning side, including Gordon Cowans, Ken McNaught and Tony Morley turned out for the Legends and Lions side.

Aston Villa fans, perhaps suffering from big match withdrawal symptoms due to the lack of a competitive fixture this weekend, were able to console themselves by cheering on their former stars.

Lee Hendrie set up Tony Morely for a goal for the Legends and Lions, but Julian Joachim netted an equaliser before the captain grabbed his penalty to send the crowd wild.

Because of this, the word ""doctor"" doesn't always relate to the character from Doctor Who and as such doesn't always belong on /r/DoctorWho.

I'm probably going to get on this soon. I'm on their PAYG, for £15 I get the £15 for calls and then next month I get unlimited texts and data which is decent and handy when I'm completely skint and the £15 can be better spent elsewhere. Coverage is very good around Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, Chester, Manchester and the roads/rails in between, it drops a bit in the sticks but I do better than most others. I've been with them for 8 years, customer support is not bad on the phone and very good in store.

The only thing stopping me is they're offering a deal for a contract with a phone (Moto G 16Gb) with the top call package which works out at about £50 more over the course of 24 months than buying the phone outright then doing the rolling contract and I can't really afford the phone outright.

Fifth is all well and good in some ways, but I don't think there's a single person on this sub that would argue we deserve to be there.  We're lucky to be 5th... had Ferguson not retired, we'd likely be 6th or 7th.  Our performances this year have been uninspired at best, transcendently awful at worst.

And the thing is, even if we appoint someone like a Van Gaal or a Prandelli for next term, there's no guarantee that they'll turn us into a top 4 club overnight.  It'll take time for them to craft us into something with more tactical and mental strength, and I'd be ok with that.

**First 2 years**: PostDoc. Loads of research. Publish publish publish!

**Next 5 years**: Junior Lecturer on a 9 month contract. Now you have to keep up the research whilst also teaching and taking on admin duties. Best to take on as many pointless committee roles as possible, because if you're not indispensable come your contract review, you're out on your arse mate! Hope you like 100 hour weeks at £25k a year!

**Next 15 years**: Lecturer. Phew you have a permanent contract! Now you can sit back, relax and occasionally take a Sunday off. Your pay is doubled and you now only work 80 hour weeks.

**15 years up?** Are you a world renowned expert with a publication list so long the British Library has a wing named after you? No? Well now you're a ""Senior Lecturer"". Pay increase but same hours as before. Yes? Well done! Now you're a Professor, you can pull the big bucks and actually go home at 5pm!


So yeah. Screw that. I'd rather go back to industry where I can earn twice as much from the get go and actually have a social + private life!

And over supply is a serious issue, in most subjects far less than 5% of PhD students go on to academia. Much as the media like to harp on about ""useless"" degrees, oversupply is everywhere.

I've never been without pain in my life, I have between 20 and 30 dislocations each day, including my spine and ribs which can be fatal as well as agonisingly painful. The older I get, the worse it becomes and each year seems to bring a new problem that drastically reduces my quality of life.

I now have a paralysed stomach and I'm fed via a tube through my abdomen and into my small intestine. I require a powered wheelchair, ceiling hoists and remote control doors just to move around and even with such adaptations, I spend most of my time chained to my bed by my feeding pump as the bottles of liquid feed I require are not compatible with my mobile feeding backpack.

I have mild seizures. I collapse regularly because my heart is too weak to pump blood to my brain and my blood pressure is low. I'm extremely underweight as even with a feeding tube, I can't absorb all I need.

I'm at risk of strokes, aneurysms and arterial dissection (that's just the beginning of the list!)


Right now, I'm happy, I get by. I may not have my health but I have an incredible husband, a beautiful dog, a fantastic PA (carer), a wonderful family, amazing friends, a fully adapted house and garden, caring Doctors and Nurses and the love and support of people all over the world because of the internet.

Still...there will come a day where I can't take any more. Where my body fails me badly but doesn't actually kill me. I'll beg for somebody to end it, the way I'd end my dog's suffering if she ever got so sick. 

I'd hate to think that a person could end up imprisoned just for giving me the same respect they'd give to a dying animal. For caring enough about me to end my pain when I wish for it to end.

I understand the worries about people being forced into the decision but with the right safeguards in place, it could be made to work.

* Holtby's energy is great. I like it. He runs around and presses a lot. That's great and everything, he's just the guy to bring on at the 65-70th minute mark when we're up by 2 or 3 goals and are looking to contain sides. But his energy, 75% of the time does not transform to adding to build-up play going forward.

* With Lennon and Townsend in the squad, we don't have to worry about playing slow. Holtby isn't exactly electrifying - he won't solve the pace problem. In fact, he was most at fault at times for a lot of the lack in pace because he did pass sideways a lot in the final third.

* Quick movement and passing for us = Soldado, Lennon, Townsend, Dembele, Eriksen.

* Holtby was the WORST to break down defences. Don't you remember when he was being played and Eriksen wasn't getting regular games? We were cribbing about penetration and ERIKSEN ERIKSEN ERIKSEN was being chanted all the time.

I think you're forgetting what he was like for us, and remembering only the highlights. He's standing out at Fulham and making you think that he'd do the same for us. No mate, not yet.",0,1394424773,null,0,false,0,cfyqkbc,t3_1zyofb,t1_cfyqkbc,t1_cfylgly,null,1432733329,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,smokey815,num11,,"I'm not talking about pace.  At all.  I'm talking about speed of build up.  Entirely different.  Holtby plays faster than Bentaleb, Paulinho, and Mousa.  Mousa is not a quick passer.  He consistently slows the game down.  I'm not saying we should be using him to break down defenses.  Eriksen is the only one we have with a consistent ability to do that.  But we need to transition faster.  The faster we transition, the better chance we have of not having to break that defense down.  That's what I want to see.  Get the ball end to end quickly.  Don't let the defense pack 8-9 guys behind the ball.

Eriksen + Dembele have played fairly well together because Dembele always picks out Eriksen in space and he gets the final ball in. And him dribbling to get past players and venture into the final third is not slowing down the game, it allows others to make runs as well, but sadly Ade and Soldado don't do that.

Him dribbling up the field and dishing it to Eriksen isn't anything that can't be replicated with one or two smart passes.  And passes get it done faster.
