I am pretty sure during the last Malaysian stream, a loss to Reading, I was able to remove the proxy settings midstream and it worked well. I removed the proxy initially during the Reading game because of the occasional buffering.

I think you are right in that each team picks the Player content they want to offer. Just surprised QPR doesn't have the match on replay with Ads like Derby. I would guess this allows them to make more money and increase their fanbase.

I'd say there's no definitive proof of that because we've never had a proper referendum on it. But those who do support the monarchy mainly do so because they are ignorant of how an alternative would work, and give in to scaremongering about ""President Blair"" or ""President Thatcher"". Many also take the monarchy for granted and don't realise that perpetuating this symbol of imperialism, supremacy, inequality and racism, actually says a lot about the kind of society we wish to create - so I would disagree with it being ""good PR"". 

During the Irish presidential election there is a national dialogue around such issues and who they want to represent their country, based upon what values. The whole point about electing a president is that you won't get one who *nobody* likes, which is why this scaremongering about ""president blair/thatcher"" is bullshit - they'd be too unpopular to win. In fact, the Irish president ends up being a very unifying figure for the people of that nation.

Therefore, a lion is not evil.

A man eating a pig is not evil.

A man eating a pig after whipping it to near-death for hours and roasting it alive is evil (or rather, has performed an evil act, if we're making that distinction).

A man who kills and devours a woman is evil.

A man who kills a woman who wished to commit assisted suicide is not evil.

A man who eats parts of the flesh of a woman who has consented to masochistic cannibalism is not evil, although they're both pretty weird.

Try places like GumTree, sure there will be scams, lots probably, but a little bit of street wise sense will help with that.

Find out what the exit clause is for your current place, I say because if you find a great place, they don't want it empty for 2 months, I mean that's like 15% change in rent.  This means if you find a place, move as soon as you can, that will please the landlord.  Be honest with the landlord about your situation, find someone sympathetic to your pets, because realistically five cats is a lot.

Once you've done that you could potentially use your last months rent (ie not pay your current landlord), as the deposit, when it comes to the first months rent, so long as your landlord is happy with you paying that the day you move in, you could then have that money as normal (ie it's one month since you paid the deposit).

I don't know how old you are, or what shocks have happened recently, but given that my mum's cat (which as it used to belong to my flat mate, is still technically my cat) costs me a lot of money each year in vaccinations, de-worming, de-fleeing stuff, that is before a vet check-up and when she does stupid stuff, like try to fight a fox.

The post you made about doubling the money adding more incentive completely ignores what I was saying to you about the way bankers, the example I chose, seem to view the value in how much money they get.

Once you've gone past a certain level of wealth, adding more is just a way of keeping score, so decreasing, say, all banker's pay by the same amount will not decrease their incentive by that amount.

If you were a business, I would say you were not a viable business. I'd recommend a long hard look at the employment situation of both of you, with a view to changing things so that one or both of you sees a rise in income. That may involve retraining, or moving to a new job, but you need to think about the future and the long term.

I'm sure you'll find a resolution to your current situation, but unless you change your base financial situation, this will happen again and again. And the older you get, the harder it becomes to change your working and living conditions.

true,ArkonOlacar,EN,england,"Roman wants to win stuff. Ideally while playing an attractive, swashbuckling brand of football, but he would rather win titles playing attractive football than become Arsenal, win nothing aside from some Robbie Savage articles about passing triangles. Ancelotti's Chelsea was a beautiful team to watch when firing on all cylinders, and with it we claimed the title and the record for number of goals scored in a single season. However that side was leaky, and did not always perform, and that points total would have finished 3rd the following season and 2nd last season, as well as failing to match our points totals in our other title winning seasons. 

Which would I prefer? 95 points with 72 goals scored 15 conceeded and a title over 86 points with 103 scored 32 conceeded and finish runners up most seasons.

Feel free to call me an optimist, but I sincerely believe still that this Chelsea side Mourinho is building will be remembered as one of the Premier League greats. As he repeatedly has made clear we are not the finished article, and after toying with jumping straight into his end-game vision of attacking football (leading to some highscoring, unsuccessful games) he has reverted to archetypal Mourinho team development:

1) Sort your defense out, stop conceeding

2) Develop a winning mentality, grind out 1-0's even when playing poorly

3) Use this solid, successful framework as a platform for your attacking players to have fun

I don't think we saw this full evolution at Inter, and in his first spell his more conservative setup had proven successful enough that he did not see the need to make wholesale changes. At Real you can see this evolution to the full; and his 'final product' broke the record for points scored (100), goals scored (121), longest unbeaten run (23 games) and both away and overall wins in a season (16 and 32). Lets just let the magnitude of those numbers sink in for a moment.

Mourinho has showed he is capable of producing powerful attacking teams. Can he do the same with our current team roster? No. It's been rehashed to death, but we need a truly great goalscorer. Torres and Eto'o are currently good strikers - good is not enough, we need great. Combine that with a number of key players both needing time to mesh into the team while also being at a relatively early stage in their careers, and it's obvious why myself and many others wrote off this season as a transition season in August. With one or two fantastic additions we will be capable of breaking records; but for now we are doing what works, and laying the foundations for what is to come.

My 2p, take it or leave it.

Edit: To clarify; I didn't make the distinction between attractive football = pretty pointless passing a la Arsenal or Barca, and attractive football = powerful forwards shredding teams while dominating games as we saw with Mourinho's Real and recent Bayern sides. I don't think we are building a possession-based team; I think we are building a dominating, free-scoring team that will likely only be in the 50's in terms of possession, yet be in enough control in terms of territory to safely dominate games. In my view the latter is far more exciting and attractive than the former.",0,1395046134,null,0,1395046444,0,cg4mgo0,t3_20m4hs,t1_cg4mgo0,t3_20m4hs,null,1432942553,4,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,4

When the pub was closed for the night 
Out of his hole crept a wee brown mouse 
and stood in the pale moonlight. 
He lapped up the frothy foam from the floor 
then back on his haunches he sat. 
All night long you could hear him roar,

I thought Townsend had one of his better games in a Spurs shirt, he played well against Gibbs and found a lot of crosses, granted many of them didn't find Ade or Chadli, but I still thought there were a lot of positives in his game yesterday.

Vertonghen is losing me a little bit, he's such a good defender and cleans up, but there just seems to be something in his attitude that maybe I'm only noticing because I'm more aware of him, I'm not sure. But I honestly thought Younes was an absolute rock and I hope he can stay fit. If he does, please give him a new contract!

Bentaleb was our worst player, got in some good positions with the ball but could not find a pass and had some terrible decision making and bottled it in some tackles, but I'm not sure if Paulinho is deserving a place over him.

Everyone loves a fucking signing, but when we've got Sterling asserting himself and other players eager to break in, are we really going to get a guy who has not (THE KEY POINT...) proven he can be up to the demands of the PL?

I think we all are looking beyond 4th at this point, but I don't even want to do that for this conversation. If we can secure CL, we need players who are going to be more than Aspas types. Which is basically a player who did well at a club where they were the main man. It's not to say those players can't be good, it's just to say we can't know.

I don't mind spending money, but let it be on players who have proven something in a league somewhat equitable. I have to feel that if we do secure 4th, those players will be available to us. 

And with this Rodgers Revolution underway, there aren't many clubs that will be more attractive to attacking players.

No signing is a guarantee and it'd be more fair of anyone to note that. But there are certainly signings where you'd be more surprised when it didn't work out.

&gt;

&gt;The __broken windows theory__ is a [criminological](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminology) theory of the norm-setting and signalling effect of urban disorder and [vandalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism) on additional [crime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime) and [anti-social behavior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-social_behavior). The theory states that maintaining and monitoring [urban environments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area) in a well-ordered condition may stop further [vandalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism) and escalation into more serious crime.

&gt;The theory was introduced in a 1982 article by social scientists [James Q. Wilson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Q._Wilson) and [George L. Kelling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_L._Kelling). Since then it has been subject to great debate both within the [social sciences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science) and the public sphere. The theory has been used as a motivation for several reforms in criminal policy, including the controversial mass use of ""stop, question, and frisk"" by the New York Police Department.

true,samceeh,null,null,"Definitely a valid point. Nostalgia gets the better of us when our team is struggling. Everyone remembers VDV's artistry, for example, but forgets that he rarely had enough in the tank to finish out 90 minutes, and his hamstrings were a constant worry. 

In terms of squad, I think we are definitely better. Super Pav used to drive me up the wall. If he wasn't scoring- and he was never prolific for us- then he was basically invisible. Talented in a languid, Berba-esque way for sure, but Soldado is a big upgrade despite this poor season. I never rated Dempsey that highly, and I wasn't sorry when he was sold. Didn't seem to understand what kind of player to be for us, even though I'm not Chadli's biggest fan either, I'm glad we bought a winger. Townsend is a good squad player too. 

You'll never hear me say a bad word about Kranjcar. I absolutely loved him as a footballer, and was always annoyed Redknapp didn't play him more often- doubly so when Bale was out for a stretch and Pienaar was preferred over the Croatian. Yes, he was slow, but he was creative and fucking handsome.

Corluka...are memories so short? Corluka who had to battle with the supreme Alan Hutton for a spot at RB? Walker may lose his head occasionally, and doesn't seem to be decisive enough yet to be top class, but he is streets ahead of what we used to have. Naughton looked a capable replacement against Chelsea and Arsenal, I thought. 

Huddlestone was a passenger. Yes, better passing range than anyone we have. But that's it, that's all he brings. His lack of pace means he's a poor defender, and a liability when put up against anyone with more pace than him. Which is everybody. He was an excellent servant to THFC, and I like him as a guy, but I fully understood the decision to sell.

My main point, which I guess I'll reach eventually, is that it's a faulty comparison from the get go. When Redknapp introduced a squad player for whatever reason (injury etc), it was into a settled team that knew how they were supposed to play (pass to Modric, essentially). We have no real idea what our new squad is capable of because of the upheaval, confusion and general fuckery at WHL this season. We are relying on pure talent alone at the moment, which is why we can't do it against the big boys who are all settled and organised. Not Sherwood's fault necessarily, we need time and the summer. I'd argue that we still have no idea what our strongest XI is, so who is a 'squad' player, truly?

https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-how-biased-is-the-bbc-17028

&gt; Among political sources, Labour and Conservatives dominate coverage accounting for 86% of source appearances in 2007 and 79.7% in 2012. Our data also show that Conservatives get more airtime than Labour. Bearing in mind that incumbents always receive more coverage than opposition politicians, the ratio was much more pronounced when the Conservatives were in power in 2012.
&gt; 

&gt; In strand one (reporting of immigration, the EU and religion), Gordon Brown outnumbered David Cameron in appearances by a ratio of less than two to one (47 vs 26) in 2007. In 2012 David Cameron outnumbered Ed Milliband by a factor of nearly four to one (53 vs 15). Labour cabinet members and ministers outnumbered Conservative shadow cabinet and ministers by approximately two to one (90 vs 46) in 2007; in 2012, Conservative cabinet members and ministers outnumbered their Labour counterparts by more than four to one (67 to 15).
&gt; 
&gt; In strand two (reporting of all topics) Conservative politicians were featured more than 50% more often than Labour ones (24 vs 15) across the two time periods on the BBC News at Six. So the evidence is clear that BBC does not lean to the left it actually provides more space for Conservative voices.

In a word, no. At least, not claiming JSA. I saw people with poor English, but they were notable more for their scarcity than anything else. Some brought friends to translate, but often we just had to struggle through. It could be frustrating for both parties, and we naturally enjoyed limited success. The government certainly needs to provide half-decent translation services or start referring people to English lessons. Luckily, one of my fellow volunteers was able to speak Portuguese, so he was able to help a fair few of the customers. Those foreigners I did see were trying just as hard (or not) as any British citizen.

I hate the word 'foreign.' In modern English it’s used as an insult more often than not :(.

So you live in the middle of nowhere and pretend this reflects the entire country? Fuck you.

People claiming bias are not calling for 50:50 coverage between government and opposition, they are comparing like with like.

https://theconversation.com/hard-evidence-how-biased-is-the-bbc-17028

&gt; Among political sources, Labour and Conservatives dominate coverage accounting for 86% of source appearances in 2007 and 79.7% in 2012. Our data also show that Conservatives get more airtime than Labour. Bearing in mind that incumbents always receive more coverage than opposition politicians, the ratio was much more pronounced when the Conservatives were in power in 2012.
&gt; 

&gt; In strand one (reporting of immigration, the EU and religion), Gordon Brown outnumbered David Cameron in appearances by a ratio of less than two to one (47 vs 26) in 2007. In 2012 David Cameron outnumbered Ed Milliband by a factor of nearly four to one (53 vs 15). Labour cabinet members and ministers outnumbered Conservative shadow cabinet and ministers by approximately two to one (90 vs 46) in 2007; in 2012, Conservative cabinet members and ministers outnumbered their Labour counterparts by more than four to one (67 to 15).
&gt; 
&gt; In strand two (reporting of all topics) Conservative politicians were featured more than 50% more often than Labour ones (24 vs 15) across the two time periods on the BBC News at Six. So the evidence is clear that BBC does not lean to the left it actually provides more space for Conservative voices.

City have the extra burden of intense pressure on them, too: they *have* to win their remaining games to catch up and that creates a lot of worry and a lot of stress. I wouldn't be surprised if they end up dropping points in games they should easily win just through that. 

Chelsea are a fantastic defensive unit but they're often caught out with counter-attacking play and they hate being on the backfoot: see Saturday's Aston Villa game for proof of that. Luckily, we just happen to be one of the most fearsome counter-attacking teams in Europe right now. 

Arsenal have their annual capitulation to worry about, as well as their poor form: by the end of the derby yesterday, they had 6 defenders on the pitch and only Giroud up front. That's not a performance of champions but of desperation, of a manager who needed points so badly that he completely negated his team's usual way of playing and asked them to create a 9-man wall so the opposition couldn't get through.

true,Glitter-Herpes,eng-lancashire,Wigan - Land of the Pies,"People who constantly slate BBC Three as being shit are missing the point.  

Yes, there is crap on it, but it's a good channel depending on your age and what you're interested in.  

They have shown plenty of programmes that raise awareness of binge drinking, drug use, and sexual diseases/infections. The reason why they're presented by ""pop presenters"" is because they're trying to target a younger audience. If those same programmes were done in BBC Four fashion, I doubt most of the young people who watch BBC Three would be interested in it. That programme they did about the sexual clinics in Leeds and (I think) Exeter were pretty light-hearted and humourous, but if it gets teenagers talking about it in school the next day then they've done their job. It makes those young people aware of such issues and talk about it. That's the point.  

If you think BBC Three really is awful and terrible, why do you watch it? If you much prefer BBC Two and Four, then watch those, stop watching BBC Three, then bitching about how shit it is.  

People like us who pay for the BBC get a lot of good stuff from it. Attenborough documentaries, BBC Two, Four, The Writer's Room on the website. If having all that means also paying for something like Snog, Marry, Avoid? then I don't mind that.  

People need to get over themselves. Viewers aren't automatically philistines and have a couple of brain cells just because once a week they enjoy some light relief and entertainment by sticking Sun, Sex and Suspicious Parents on.  

If you think BBC Three is genuinely god-awful and not worth 5 seconds of airtime, that isn't because it's a shit channel, it's because it's obviously not aimed at you in particular. I think Eastenders is god-awful and terrible, but I don't shout from the rooftops that it should be pulled.

But it is a different argument from the one you were making that these searches were leading to discoveries. The article gives absolutely no information whatsoever about whether or not that is the case. Given that police in this country have the ability conduct searches based on a vague suspicion they have no requirement to particularly substantiate the threshold for a search is not high. 

There is no reason for them not to go fishing for weaponry in the event of a tresspasser, or for someone making threats. Such a search would not be remotely problematic to justify by the current threshold set by the Met, but would also be a quite unreasonable violation. Nor is it hard to construe a suspicion that there may be a weapon, and even moreso for drugs. 

I would point out that the suspicions they are required to have are the SAME as for the one of the horrendously abused stop and search powers, which results in an unfathomably low number of charges resulting from the searches. They too are required to suspect weapons or drugs. The Met suspect and search for weapons and drugs at the drop of a hat, with very limited or vague justification, are overwhelmingly wrong in their suspicions, and are backed up by their superiors to the hilt in doing so.

So if you do not believe they would strop search a trespasser for weaponry, or a vandal for class A drugs, you don't have much experience of the Met's approach to searches.

If you wish to have confidence in the ability of the Met and the IPCC to investigate and respond to complaints, and that they take the process seriously, that is good. However given that the IPCC itself does not share that confidence I cannot share that position.

No one has suggested that this is a result of lechery. Note, I am still not saying these searches are bad or too high. Just that a belief that these searches resulted in a large number of charges directly resulting from material found is both unfounded by the article, or any other evidence we have and also quite unlikely given what is public information about the Met's general approach to searches.

We simply don't know the success rate. It may be high, but it is not 62%. Assumption that is high returns to trusting in the Met, and its safeguards.

&gt;""More productive firms in cities like London will be able to serve distant markets in northern cities much more efficiently from their existing base rather than from bases located in the northern cities,"" he says.

&gt;""So, if the time to market is reduced between London and the northern cities, that is going to mainly benefit firms that are already located in London. That seems to be what happens in most of the cases around the world where these railway lines have been introduced.""

You could try something like eminent domain to force the owners to sell most of their land to the government at a fair price and leave the government in charge of selling the property to the public, with specific people barred from buying and strict limits on how much could be purchased at a time. That requires a lot of trust in the government, though, and would risk running foul of lobbyists and their ability to encourage loopholes in the legislation. You could go for a more straightforward approach and simply require all landholding above X amount to be sold, with X remaining the upper limit of ownership. 

One obvious practical problem with both solutions is there's no guarantee enough people can afford to buy the land, so I suppose you'd have to auction or artificially deflate the selling price. Or, you could take the long view and limit how much property can be transferred as inheritance to force some land to be sold on to third parties. This solution would take time, but would, in the long run, spread out the landholding, though who knows by how much.

true,pretzpretz,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"There are no news organisations which demonstrate no political bias. Owen Jones isn't any more biased than most commentators, it's just that his bias breaks with neoliberalism whereas most other commentators do not so his bias appears more pronounced because it's less common.

If more 'mainstream' commentators appear biased then that is because their bias is repeated over and over until it appears to be common sense.

As to why those commentators appear more frequently, with the same people being given similar jobs over the course of decades, I think that this interview by Andrew Marr of Noam Chomsky way back in 1996 is really illustrative.

http://www.aithne.net/index.php?e=news&amp;id=4&amp;lang=0

Marr: I’m just interested in this because I was brought up, like a lot of people, probably post-Watergate film and so on, to believe that journalism was a crusading craft, and that there were a lot of disputatious, stroppy, difficult people in journalism, and I have to say, I think I know some of them. 

Chomsky: Well, I know some of the best... best-known investigative reporters in the United States - I won’t mention names - whose attitude toward the media is much more cynical than mine. In fact, they regard the media as a sham. And they know, and they constantly talk about how they try to... play it like a violin: If they see a little opening they’ll try to squeeze something in that ordinarily wouldn’t make it through. And it’s perfectly true that this is a crusading profession, adversarial, ""We stand up against power"", very self-serving view. On the other hand, in my opinion, I hate to make a value judgement but, the better journalists, and in fact, the ones who are often regarded as the best journalists, have quite a different picture and, I think, a very realistic one. 

Marr: How can you know that I’m self-censoring? How can you know that journalists are... 

Chomsky: I don’t say you’re self-censoring - I’m sure you believe everything you’re saying; but what I’m saying is, if you believed something different, you wouldn’t be sitting where you’re sitting.

The problem then becomes, as with all the ""Russell Brands"" here on Reddit, they never supply a workable alternative, or even if they do, they haven't thought it through to it's logical conclusion or they choose to ignore 50,000 years of human nature and suddenly assume everyone will not find a way to cheat any new system that is put in place.

I've said this before ... if you took all the wealth of this nation, and divided it equally amongst the populace, many would simply piss it up the wall, while the Ark-ark-arkwrights amongst us would find myriad inventive ways to separate people from their money in exchange for needed goods and services.

End result ... the wealth accumulates with a small percentage of people, just as it is now. Problem is, there's no safety net for those who wasted their share, no jobs to earn more (because Kulture doesn't believe in us wasting our lives doing ""trivial unnecessary tasks"" for fiat), and I assume it would lead to an even bigger divide between the haves and have-nots than we see today.

Socialism (true socialism) cannot work because it is at odds with human nature. First eliminate greed, stupidity, self-determination and choice, and then, only then, it might work.

People are not equal, we are all different, and hence have different needs.

However, at the end of this season, I really think he's showed he's got a lot of development left.  He routinely finds himself out of position, he makes a lot of rash tackles, and he's made quite a few absent-minded plays this year.  Add in a long term injury this season, and I just don't see him being courted by clubs bigger than Tottenham.

No, you assume that to be the case. There is nothing to show that Prince Charles has any more influence on MPs than an average voter. Ministers give him time because his estate pays millions upon millions of pounds into the government every year.

One rough year (5th and we were at record points) and people are starting to shit the bed with over the top negativity. I am embarrassed to watch a fan go crazy about the benefica fans taking over a large portion of his section in front of his own 5 year old child yelling and swearing. he left the game early and carried on all game and didn't watch hardly any of the game. Sure i would be angry but i would write a letter and complain and get a refund to show my disapproval or if these guys had signs stubhub out i could get on board but it's nothing constructive and not is going to help our club.

This is an example of the negativity and the same negativity which I witnessed vs Hull city when avb critiscised the fans. People yelling and swearing at our own players. When I go to other games and watch teams like crystal palace. Their fans go mental and I see positive fans with hardly any negativity even though they are fighting for survival. Our fans are expecting to win every game.

I don't have blind faith in Levy but i do not believe it is constructive to start this arsenal/piers morgan style fickle bullshit from our own fans #levyout etc. What good does it achieve? We look like dicks. We look like Arsenal fans.

Sure let's have the conversation and scrutinise his actions between fans but still you have to realise the good things he has done for the club as well as the bad things or things he could've done better.At this stage it is a bit extreme to start saying levy out....

The horrible thing is pretty much everyone gets into this mentality where they think their consumer choice of mass produced furniture says something really exquisite and interesting about them.

no you just think ""looks nice"" and thats it.

Newcastle is a great city, there's plenty to do for free. I recommend a walk down the quay side from the Newcastle side of town. Take in the tyne bridge (The father and inspiration for your own Sydney harbor bridge) then keep walking and cross the millennium eye bridge to the Gateshead side. Here you can go into the Balltic art gallery, it's free and has cool cool pieces in atm inspired by Phillip Pullman's His Dark Materials work. It also gives you an amazing view of Newcastle from the top floor.

Newcastle city centre is great, it's full of old Georgian buildings. The nightlife is fantastic. If your student age check out Digital or World Head Quarters, if your a bit older ""The Gate"" has some nice bars, restaurants and a cinema all under one roof or if you want something a bit more refined (expensive) check out the quayside bars and restaurants. 

There is Some great old tradition english pubs can be found dotted around town too such as [Bob Trollops](http://www.happycow.net/review_photos/hcmp778_10303_s3.jpeg) 

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Bob_Trollop,_Newcastle_upon_Tyne.jpg

It literally looks like a pub has been time warped from the Victorian times.

Avoid the ""Big Market"" at night, this is where are the local chavs and scallywags like to drink, it's cheap and nasty. Alot of people who drink around the big market go out with the soul purpose of getting so drunk they can't walk then start fights. Don't let this put you off going out in newcastle tho, there is always a police presence and as long as you avoid the tasteless clubs you'll have a great time. 

The Metro Centre is about 3 or 4 miles out of Newcastle city center and is the largest shopping mall in the UK. It's great if you want to shop all day but is a bit lifeless in my opinion. Personally if I want to shop I go to Newcastle, the shops are a bit more spread out but walking among the Georgian and Shakespearean building is much more stimulating than the cold steel and plastic of the metro center.

Geordies can be a bit hard to understand for people who've never heard the accent before. You'll quickly pick it up and be telling your mates ""wey aye hinny just picked the bairns up now gannin for a bottle o' dog then gannin yem"" in no time.

This season has seen SEVERAL own goals or mistakes leading to goals. Skrtel's  2 own goals against Stoke comes to mind, Kolo has had a poor season imo after starting quite strongly and Agger seems to have started becoming more prone to mistakes (handball in the first game of the season). Certainly mistakes like these aren't acceptable at this level of the game as it could've turned our great season into a good season or worse  HOWEVER, it didn't. Due to our potent attack in some way we can afford to have these kind of slip-ups due to the high-risk all out attack methods we're adopting. I feel in some way that because of these tactics we're deploying we're more prone to coming across mistakes in our back line. I'd also like to feel that if we weren't so clinical up front and were under more pressure, that our back line would perform to a much higher standard. Complacency is inevitable to some extent when you play with such arrogant swagger which we do.

TL;DR first choice CBs unavailable for most of the season leading to more mistakes. Mistakes that have happened are not the end of the world seeing as overall our attack more than makes up for the defense. and first choice CB pairing will be back very soon.

Apologies for stereotyping, but if you surf, there is actually the potential to do so here, Tynemouth has surfing, but it'll seem like plunging into the arctic by AU standards.

The first comments he made when he was asked if he would move in the summer was something along the lines of ""I am focused on the season at hand and then the WC, after that who knows""....basically telling everyone he isn't considering anythign aside from the task at hand and the WC.  Fairly standard response...however the media spun it into ""Vertonghen refuses to commit to Spurs for the rest of his life and is clearly going to move if they miss CL.""

So he learns his lesson after that fiasco and says in one of the  interviews comes out and says...""I 100% see myself at Spurs next season but we haven't spoken about a contract, and yes i think i have been playing poorly and deserved to get called out by Sherwood""...which is him being accountable and also stating we haven't spoken about a contract (which Spurs had been rumored to be preparing to offer) but again we will see after the season what happens (again, he is saying focused on season and WC), which the media spin into ""Spurs unhappy with Vertonghen and will move him on if they miss CL""

So in this one he says ""i think we can make CL next season and i am committed to Spurs""...which is called a ""hint"" that he may stay, somehow the media will probably say he is leaving and start the stories of it happening again.

I feel bad for him, he just can't win....he really hasn't said anything out of line but the media keep spinning a non-starter of a story into a tabloid headline, if i were him i would just pull a Mou and say ""I don't want to talk about it""....unfortunately if he did that the story in the Mail would probably be ""Spurs tragedy as angry Vertonghen demands to leave WHL""",0,1395069636,null,0,false,0,cg4ry3e,t3_20mg6m,t1_cg4ry3e,t1_cg4oe63,null,1432945202,9,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,9

They are often looking for evening/weekend staff, pay relatively well, and usually provide full training and don't require much/any experience. Depending on what kind of call centre it is, there are often perks (I worked in for Sky for a while &amp; got free satelitte telly, which made me very popular!)

Other jobs include cleaning work (again, not fun, but usually early in the morning before college, so don't impede your social life of an evening/weekend).

Check in bars/pubs to see if they need someone to set quizzes? You don't usually need much to get going (there's usually some really good reference books in libraries which would set a half decent quiz), the pub provides a prize &amp; pays you a fee (&amp; usually a free drink while you are working). I used to do three pubs each week, earned around £20 from each (long time ago now though), and basically work was a pub quiz three nights per week.

Depending on your skills, and where you live. Check to see if local stables require any help. Very often they can get the younger riders to do in exchange for cheap lessons/livery, but sometimes they need a grown up, or a few hours that students can't do (like in the dark in the winter). It's hard work, and often very cold, but if you like horses, it's good.

Also, do you like children? Some people do. There are lots of childrens clubs (weekends/afternoons/midweek) that are usually looking for helpers. Look for a Tumbletots or Yogabugs group? You will need to be CRB checked, but most often, the employer will pay for that.

Luxembourg may be similar in terms of population, but it has benefited from an exceptional confluence of circumstances in its history. It has managed to carve out a niche as a tax haven aided by centuries of political stability and a strategic location (surrounded by Europe's strongest economies). 

Northern Ireland doesn't have those advantages. Northern Ireland lacks the territorial isolation of a country like Scotland or Iceland, and a strong sense of unified nationhood and heritage like the latter states and Luxembourg. 

Moreover, there are already three overlapping concepts of national identity in Northern Ireland: Irish, Northern Irish, and British. Across the three camps there are those who are uncomfortable* with the idea of joining a nation with which they don't identify (i.e. Ireland or the UK). However, an independent NI wouldn't address this: rather than pissing off one side of the community, it just pisses off both sides to roughly the same extent. I'm not sure that that's better.

There's also the fact that we have no unique selling point economically: we don't have a strong industrial sector any more, we've never had a strong service industry, and there's no big money in agriculture. The backwards political/social situation here has precluded any serious foreign investment of the sort that the Republic has attracted (especially in technology and pharmaceuticals) - and considering the sort of anarchy that erupts over a change in the vexillological calendar, it's not a stretch to suggest that that social situation would get worse in the inevitable upheaval of independence. 

*and around here, ""uncomfortable"" is obviously a shorthand for ""prepared to blow things up""

10 Drunken lads are standing around outside a night club, all smoking weed and shouting stuff like 'BABE I COULD TAKE YOU OUT TO PRIMARK AND GET YOU LOOKIN A LOT NICER THAN YOU ARE RIGHT NOW HAHA YA LITTLE SCRUFF', basically, being knob heads.

The knob head attitude these lads portray gets the attention of the police. EVERY ONE OF THESE TEN LADS HAS A JOINT IN THEIR HANDS, 8 of them throw them down a grid and then run away. The UK &amp; US stand there still, with the joints in their hands, apologising to officers. They get dragged into the back of the police van and have to have a nights kip in a police cell, then get fined £60 for drunk and disorderly. 

The other 8 lads are Russia, China, Germany, France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India. 

Hardly fair that the US &amp; UK had to pay the money and sleep on the hard bed with no cover, softly shivering, stoned and drunk, gasping for a cup of tea, while having to listen to the other naughty men kicking their doors and shouting 'POLICE SCUM', surrounded by thick white walls, a huge metal door, with slight munchies and a restless feeling due to slight feelings of anxiety and the fact that they want to go home and fry that pulled pork they got from that Asian shop in the city centre. 

Meanwhile, the other 8nations are still out drinking, one of them is getting sucked off in the nightclub toilets, 2 of them are doing lines outside the cubical and the others are fighting outside with the doormen. 

Poor UK &amp; US, they just want to lie in bed comfortably with full stomachs in the warmth, watching a David Attenborough documentary and softly wanking off under the covers with their eyes closed (because they can't be arsed moving to actually watch porn). 

Then when they get released the next day everybody talks about how they got arrested and they're worse than all the rest of their mates. ",0,1395071757,null,0,false,0,cg4stev,t3_20mo6l,t1_cg4stev,t1_cg4sa9o,null,1432945611,-4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-4

&gt;__St Peter's Church__ is a former [Anglican](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England) church in the [Preston Village](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_Village,_Brighton) area of [Brighton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton), in the [English](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) city of [Brighton and Hove](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_and_Hove). The 13th-century building, standing on the site of two older churches, was [restored](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_restoration) in the late 19th century and again after a serious fire in 1906. It was the [parish church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parish_church) of Preston until 1908, when the newly built [St John the Evangelist's Church](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_the_Evangelist%27s_Church,_Preston_Village,_Brighton) gained this status. The [Diocese of Chichester](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_of_Chichester) declared St Peter's redundant in 1990, and it is now owned by the [Churches Conservation Trust](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churches_Conservation_Trust). It has [Grade II* listed status](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listed_building), reflecting its architectural and historical importance.

Not necessarily. 

Without reading all of the comments here, I suspect I may have been beaten to making this point, but the BBC is probably biased towards reciprocal altruism, which sadly is seen as left wing, because it employs intelligent people that aren't working in an environment where they have to make direct sales, so they can afford to be largely compassionate.

However, the claims of bias towards the right are based on the numbers of right-wingers that are offered guest spots outweighing those on the left. This is empirically measurable information, but in itself probably doesn't strongly suggest ideological bias on the BBC's part. 

It may be that right-wingers are more strident about insisting they appear on the BBC, whilst left-wingers (now Alistair Campbell is mostly retired) aren't quite so pushy. That's just speculation though.

Having more right wingers as guests isn't indicative of ideology. Writers, journalists and creative types are probably more likely to be altruistic, but that's just a bit left-leaning rather than full on socialist. Criticising business and corporate vested interests, which is what journalists should be doing, when they've good reason to, isn't left-wing either. Unfortunately, the right-wing feels it can criticise them for doing this on ideological grounds.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"Why would the Saxons necessarily have failed? It took a pretty overwhelming set of circumstances to lead to the Norman invasion. I mean these things happened simultaneously:

1. The normative royal family went extinct in the male line.  
2. A vicious scary hard bastard became King in Norway. Who happened to be the grandson of Canute.  
3. A vicious scary bastard became Duke of Normandy. The scariest duchy in France. Hammering dozens of rebellious lords in the process.  
4. A particularly politically minded pope came into existence.  
5. The obvious Saxon alternative to the old Wessex line just happened to get bloody ship wrecked in Normandy earlier in his life.  

Even then Godwin defeated the terrifying Norwegian bloke and was moments away from beating the Normans before a lack of experience in his troops did him in. If any one of these conditions were different the Norman invasion likely fails or never happens at all.

Now a bigger question is what happens with the various unions in the UK. The Normans weren't nearly as hated as the Saxons were. Strangely enough the say so of the pope meant they were seen as more legitimate than the Saxons. Also the Normans propagated the old stories about Saxon invaders as the dejure real history (which is why King Arthur is an English folk tale).

I don't think you understand exactly the logistics of a supply-chain. What we're talking about here is the entire north of England having problems getting supplies that they currently get from Scotland because importing becomes too problematic. One good example of this is seafood, entire restraunts will either have to cull their profits or simply go out of business as they would no longer be able to source the product as efficiently.

Those businesses may move south, but it'll mean that people in the North suffer badly. Premises will close, people will lose their jobs, etc. 


&gt;The importance of Scotland is possibly overstated by the nats. I see no reason why we should help a country that plans to undermine us anyway.

It doesn't seek to ""undermine"" the UK. Lowering corporate tax isn't an intentional effort to undermine the UK. It's a policy that's incredibly popular to Scottish sensibilities, a form of social corporatism, that doesn't sell in Westminster because it's full of millionaires. Adjusting our tax rates a little to encourage investment isn't undermining the UK, businesses will still be relatively attracted to the UK as more ""stable"" and I don't think it's mature, or economically valid, for English economists to think that Scotland doesn't need to offer additional insentive to survive.


&gt;As for water, I think only a portion of the country will be effected. My tap won't have a drop of ""Scottish water"" coming out of it, and if you mean mineral water there is always Buxton, Harrogate, volvic, evian, etc.

Yes, only a portion of the country would be affected. The North of England, despite getting lots of Scottish water, still suffers the occasional hose-pipe ban and other drought mitigation measures. For humanitarian reasons I doubt this would change very much, assuming England was willing to actually facilitate an Independent Scotland to some extent. However if we're assuming the vast measures of spite and competitiveness that you are I'm entirely sure that cities in the North of England would suffer near water-poverty in summer.",0,1395074089,null,0,false,0,cg4tugp,t3_20jq6a,t1_cg4tugp,t1_cg4tdnn,null,1432946096,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

That's a pretty vulnerable attribute for a CB, and it's something that's very difficult to change.

Ultimately it's up to you to decide. I would go to open days and apply anyway, you can turn offers down but it keeps your options open until the last possible minute.

So how do you go about getting them? You do two things: First, you make sure that your rehabilitation programs are totally useless - get people into your prisons, and make sure they're stuck there. Second, you lobby government to unbalance the justice system - make sure that those most likely to commit crimes (the poor) cannot afford proper legal cover, try to get longer prison terms, and even ""three strikes and you're out"" life terms. 

Now I know this sounds a bit tinfoil hat, but think about it, but lobbying is huge in this country - country suppers with the PM, huge ""consultancy"" fees for MPs and Lords, old boy networks, cozy relationships with HMRC... &amp;etc. If the head of G4S calls up No.10 I bet they pick up the phone.

If you are going to go to a top 10 uni then sure, but beyond that it's just words on a CV that don't mean much to 90% of the people hiring. There are some subjects (notably engineering) that are still a good way of getting a good job, but in IT they aren't really important to employers, and i say that as someone who's both worked in IT for 11 years and has hired and interviewed people for IT jobs. 




In the current UK IT market there is a strong demand for *experienced* people. Having 3-4 years experience instead of a degree will put you in a much better position to both get a job and earn from it - having 4 more years experience in sysadmin for example would up my wages by a good 15k or more a year. Going to university cost me a good £18k which I'll be paying back for at least another 7 years (plus another ~10k in overdraft and credit card debt accrued at uni) , and I don't feel that I got anything of value from it. I wish I'd gotten an IT job and spent 4 years working, I'd be in a far better position both career and financially wise than i am now. 




As another option, why limit yourself to the uk ? There are plenty of European options that teach in English and cost much less - ie, Germany, The Netherlands (iirc its about £350 per term there), where you'd still get a degree but would cost you a lot less than the UK unis charge.

I'm not really arguing that we would fine refs for missing penalty calls or the odd bad decision because of a poor angle. What I'm saying is that 6 reds in 8 games is a little suspicious to me along with the no-calls that we've seen him miss. At some point, to me at least, it stops being a series of unrelated incorrect decisions and becomes an active bias. 

Refs are always going to make bad calls because there is only one of them out there and they can't always see everything 5 times from 5 different angles like we do. It's worth thinking of ways to help the refs in those situations with the use of technology, but that's a different discussion altogether.

I honestly have not watched Livermore play even once for Hull, because I haven't watched any of their games aside from playing us. From what I understand though, he's been a regular starter? I'd surprised if he came back to warm the bench again, no matter how solid his year has been. 

I remember a couple of occasions when Livermore genuinely played very well for us, in a kind of muscular but unspectacular way. I don't hate him, but I think he's 24 now? He's unlikely to get that much better than he is. I'd prefer him to stay at Hull and carve himself a career, rather than waste his time with us. Bentaleb seems like much more of a prospect. 

However, there have been some serious question marks over the attitude of several players this season, something i've not seen at Spurs for a couple of years, and rarely this deep malaise that seems to hang over the club.

I think university can teach you things that throwing yourself straight into work can't, so don't see it as just a means to get a job, as it offers so much more than that (At least that is my impression).

Where I work we hire paid interns in our junior positions, and whilst we prefer them to have some form of IT qualification it isn't critical, and we have some really promising guys that couldn't change directory when they started with us.

Nevertheless they managed to run the intercity routes at cost, compare that to today where those routes are heavily subsidised (except East Coast which went from being a massive loss making private route, to just about being in profit, with the highest customer ratings, all after it was nationalised a few years ago), BR managed to run so efficiently that they actually consulted the continental railways, which you will notice are still nationalised and in fact ultimately own many of the companies running our routes. If we had had a similar amount of investment to the continent, and BR hadn't been run into the ground in preparation for privatisation we might have a service to rival the rest of Europe (take Ireland who have over a 99% record on being on time, thats with a 5 minutes window of the eta, after privatisation here in the UK we now have a 30minute window and don't get anywhere close to that on time rate. 

As for state owned, invested, or guaranteed industry, well yes it would be mad to subsidise clearly uneconomic projects, no ones talking about that. The point is more Mines were closed under the Wilson government than Thatcher, the difference was that uneconomic mines were identified in partnership with the Unions, closed, and new jobs found. A good example of this is with Michael Foot, who had to close the steel works in his own constituency Ebwr Vale, he genuinely thought he was going to be lynched when it was announced. When it closed they re-tooled, and up-skilled the workforce and opened a steel plating plant, which was a huge success. What happened under Thatcher was a politically motivated attack (this is all coming out with the 30 year rule cabinet papers) to close both uneconomic mines yes, but a huge number of profitable mines also (there was one mine which was targeted as 'uneconomical' which was taken over as a worker coop that only closed a couple of years ago, there is still a small amount of mining in the UK). They cynically left entire communities with no other option when they were closed, no investment to create new jobs, nothing.  And it turned out to be a false economy, it costs a lot more to put thousands on the dole, destroying local economies and satellite businesses etc, than it is to wind down one industry as you build up another. 

Ok as for the deficit, you have to go back to the planned mixed economy period to find constant budget surplices, its under the neoliberal, hands-off, economy where we find budget deficits. Both Thatcher and Major ran bigger deficits than Labour, Labours deficit compared very favourably to other countries in fact, to the point that George Osbourne promised to match Labour spending pound for pound. Then the crash hit, and because we had shifted our economy so far away from industry towards the service and finance sector we were far more exposed than any other country (say like Germany which maintains a strong SME industry). As people lost their jobs, and we bailed out the financial sector the deficit ballooned, we weren't living beyond our means, we were simply too exposed, thanks in part also to light touch regulation (Osbourne was calling for more deregulation beforehand if you remember). 

We're not a poor country, private wealth in this country has never been higher, £7 trillion, wealth inequality has never been higher either and this is the reason were having such issues with growth and deficit reduction. The fact that the top earners contribute 30% of tax revenue is a huge problem, not something to boast about as the Tories keep doing. A huge amount of money is being withheld from the real economy. Start ups, and even long established companies simply cannot get the investment they need to expand to create more jobs, this is where the state needs to step in. 

The 'good times' under Constervative and New Labour were built on a fib, it required unsustainable amounts of private debt, the subsidising of companies through tax credits, and the madness of subsidising private landlords rather than building social housing. It also required a large amount of people circulating through unemployment, in a job - on the dole for 6 months - in a job - repeat (there are only 2000 families with two generations out of work, and those out of work for more than 2 years has only skyrocketed after the crash) this kept wages low, as full employment allows for much stronger bargaining power. 

So if our country is so rich, whats there to do about it?  Well actually crack down on tax evasion and avoidance, currently HRMC have 3000 people investigating benefit fraud, but only 300 people investigating tax evasion which represents 170 times the loss than benefit fraud. a 5% one off wealth tax on the very richest in this country would eliminate the deficit for a year, allowing that money to spent on investing in new jobs. Full employment with well payed productive workers paying tax will pay off the deficit quicker than the massive shift to low pay and no pay weve seen. 

Anyway I've gone on too much, sorry about that, I probably havn't explained the position too well as there is a hell of a lot of factors to it.  If you're interested in seeing another side than the Austerity narritive I recommend two books which will explain it a lot better than me. 
Richistan by Robert Frank shows how trickle down economics is a fantasy, and also shows an insight into how the other half live, really well written, a bit like an American Louis Theroux - http://www.amazon.com/Richistan-Journey-Through-American-Wealth/dp/0307341453 

And Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein, which was published not long after the crash, and explains scarily presciently the ideological underpinning to Austerity, as well as the roots of neoliberalism. http://www.amazon.com/Shock-Doctrine-Rise-Disaster-Capitalism/dp/0312427999/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1395079797&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Shock+Doctrine 

***Edit*** Sorry, missed off a point about taking over industry etc costing money. Things like the railway you can simply allow the franchises to pass, or allow the Nationalised East Coast company to bid on the other franchises. Things like Water, or industry you want to support, you simply swap their shares for government bonds, it doesnt cost anything, and the shareholders get a secure longterm invetment, everyone wins.

We are all on the same wage, they dont regret uni, but they talk like it was a waste of time.

The problem tends to be the course that people take and the future job opportunities it has. Each person is to make their own decision but saying that just going to uni makes job opportunities better is ridiculous. Theres a reason that apprenticeship numbers have risen so dramatically. 

Which in my eyes is a better a route for someone in this situation, if he can find a apprenticeship that is suited to him it will be much better as he can earn money while learning and also get qualifications needed.

true,Silent_Ranger,null,null,"let's put this in perspective: Flanagan is 3rd on our defense in minutes played this season, there are only 3 defenders who have played half the available minutes, there is only one defender who has played consistently (more than 3/4 of the minutes this season) - these things are not due to squad rotation but injuries (Sakho, Agger, Enrique, Johnson).

Additionally Liverpool has lead for the most minutes of any team this season, there are statistical studies that show that teams that lead tend to concede more goals than teams that trail or are tied (this is seen in the 5 or so consolation goals given up by Liverpool late in games this season).

When you put these two things together there is story that begins to unfold of a team whose defensive liabilities are not quite as severe as they might seem on paper (conceding goals up 3 or 4 isn't really a big deal) that has seen an unusually high rate of turnover in defense due to injuries. Having said this Liverpool have show they have the depth to cope adequately with these injuries. 

As a side not consider that if you had to choose between the whole defense getting injured and the whole offense getting injured we ended up on the right side of that deal this season

The question I ask is in which games can you say Liverpool defended poorly. The answer is probably around 5 or so. Now how many games can you say Liverpool defended well - this is more like 10 or 15, particularly in a few noted big games against direct rivals. This says to me that Liverpool's defensive capabilities are actually at a very high level but are not the most consistent. Consistency is an issue that all teams must deal with but when injuries remove your plan B then you must learn to live with the inconsistencies. 

Over the past two weeks Liverpool have gone on the road against teams fighting for Europa League spots and kept back-to-back clean sheets. While it's not a guarantee I think it is very possible that Liverpool will continue with that sort of strong defensive performance down the stretch (maybe accumulating 5 or 6 clean sheets in the last 9 games).",0,1395081125,null,0,false,0,cg4x55r,t3_20mm73,t1_cg4x55r,t3_20mm73,null,1432947717,6,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,6

Regardless of the financial situation, Moyes' overall attitude was seriously lacking in ambition. Things like the infamous 'knife to a gunfight' quote are good examples of this manifestation. A club like Everton should ALWAYS be aiming as high as possible, even if it is unattainable in the current financial climate. I do agree with most of what you said about the owners, finances etc but I honestly believe that CANNOT be used as a reason to accept a lack of ambition. Martinez has touched upon this numerous times since taking over. At the end of the day we are in the situation we are in for the time being. Yes, we could get bought by a billionaire but as things stand, we are where we are. You can either choose to accept that and work with it by trying to use creative ways to bridge the financial gap (focus on youngsters, impose a strong footballing philosophy throughout all levels of the club - basically what Martinez is doing) or you can use that as a method of insulating yourself from criticism in the media and generally excusing a lack of ambition and defending for your lives against the likes of Liverpool and United away from home (basically what Moyes did).

Finally, you say we aren't going to finish any higher this season - how can you possibly make that comment? We finished 6th last season. This season we are in the same position yes, but we have two games in hand on Spurs and we have a realistic chance of finishing 5th. We havent finished 5th since the 08/09 season five years ago. That would certainly be huge progress given the significant transition of changing manager (look at how Brendan Rodgers did in his first full season). Plus we are on target for our highest ever premier league points total. If we carry on at the current rate we will end up on 69 points which is 4 more points than we have ever had in the premier league. So maybe we havent quite hit the glass ceiling you refer to.

Setting type was the nail in the coffin of the thorn in English, rather than the start of its demise.

Funnily enough, the thorn's sibling ð - which in fact used to be the thorn - suffered a similar fate, and ended up being written ""d"". So where Old English and Norse were once identical in sound, we now have in modern(ish) English and Danish the words ""thee"" and ""de"" (for ""you""), or ""thy"" and ""du"" (for ""your""). 

You can still hear ""your"" pronounced the old way, ""thy"", in South Yorkshire. Indeed, natives of England's fifth-largest city, Sheffield, are often teased by their neighbours and called ""Deedars"", because of how they say and pronounce ""thee"" and ""thy"" (sounds like ""thar"") instead of ""you"" and ""your"".

However, as a concept, as a basic principle, a degree is not required for *programming*/*software development*. The degree will give you sound theory to understand what the code is *physically* doing, down at a very very low level, and on the whole this is not an exact recipe into ""I can code, gimme a job"". I've interviewed many graduates who know (probably far more than I do) about what happens at a low level when I wrote some code, but you give them a physical coding task and the code they produce is shocking. It's not their fault, it's the fact they've not been taught real world practices at university.

This has been true for years and still is. University isn't going to teach you how to code. Only real world commerical experience will.

This is why maybe, *maybe*, for game development it's a little more required (i.e performance is key, maths will be your friend, your enemy).

* Is he the same player now?

* How do you expect the team to respond?

&gt; We have no reaction to Villa Park as we would bring the game into disrepute.

* Would you like Zanetti to be your assistant at some pint?

&gt; No, he belongs to Inter.

* Mancini has said he would like to pay for a meal with you if he wins, would you like a meal with him?

&gt; No.

* Is there any Turkish player that you have your eye on?

&gt; I like lots of them, but we can't compete with their salaries.

* Why wouldn't you like to eat with Mancini?

&gt; I don't do things based on results.

* Do you expect an on-field reaction to the game?

* Have you spoken to Ramires?

&gt; Do you have anything more important to talk about the game than a red card in the 92^nd minute? I feel that what happened is a consequence of the previous 92 minutes. 

* What were the more important things than the red?

&gt; I won't comment, I bring the game into the disrepute.

* Grant and RDM brought Chelsea to the final, do you feel pressure to take Chelsea to the final?

&gt; [No, no pressure.](https://twitter.com/chelseafc/status/445636655257780224)

Which sort of suggests that the commercial channels are only there thanks to the BBC's generosity, when in fact all of the commercial multiplexes transmission costs and their share of the HD multiplex are paid for by the commercial broadcasters, not the BBC. The transmission costs that are currently shared between several companies (mast and site maintenance, electricity/comms, engineers) would be a lot more expensive if the BBC had to pay for it on their own - which is probably why they've never done this, even in the days of two TV channels (the BBC owned some transmitters, the government owned the rest on behalf of the ITV companies, both parties shared each other's sites)

Everything Brendan has said, whether it's about tactics and discipline, or growing the history of the club, or developing young players, suggests he's planning to be here for the long haul. Long live Brendan tbh.

edit: it should be noted I'm not saying he doesnt want to challenge for titles here, just that when he took over that pressure wasnt there so it gave him space to implement his vision. that wouldnt exist at Barca or Man City, just as it won't exist next season for us, but the difference is that in staying with Liverpool there are the same expectations for next season (title, champions league) but it's with a crop of players playing his game plan to the letter.",0,1395083521,null,0,false,0,cg4yauc,t3_20ne9d,t1_cg4yauc,t3_20ne9d,null,1432948262,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I do not want to criticize Liverpool, but if I would be interested in footballer, as they showed in the last few days, I would do it for a week or two weeks before. ""

""I have contact with the president of Tottenham, I communicate with him. He is interested in Konoplyanka. We are in the stage of negotiations and, perhaps even close to signing a contract if Eugene agree. I would chose his place Tottenham, London, rather than Liverpool.

true,geongeaetheling,eng-northumberland,Northumberland,"&gt; William's strategy, implemented during the winter of 1069–1070 (he spent Christmas 1069 in York), has been described by some modern scholars (including William E. Kapelle) as an act of genocide. Contemporary biographers of William also considered it to be his cruelest act and a stain upon his soul. 

1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG):

&gt; Article 2 of this convention defines genocide as ""any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.""

How does the fact it happened a thousand years ago not make it a genocide just because the term was coined recently? Was Caesar's invasion of Gaul not a genocide? Or do those 1 Million Gaulish people not matter?

Perhaps he may not have considered it a genocide, perhaps we shouldn't consider the actions of the past to be genocidal. But we must consider the fact that William I killed 100,000 people and ruined countless lives. Is that not worth commemorating?

true,vzzzbux,eng-Cornwall,Cornwall,"&gt; I don't think you understand exactly the logistics of a supply-chain. What we're talking about here is the entire north of England having problems getting supplies that they currently get from Scotland because importing becomes too problematic. One good example of this is seafood, entire restraunts will either have to cull their profits or simply go out of business as they would no longer be able to source the product as efficiently.

Do they not do fishing in the north of England? Or is it exclusively a north of the border thing? I'm not sure why it would be a big deal without a currency union, it's not exactly difficult for British business to buy food from other European countries despite the completely different currencies. It would be even easier if Scotland simply had their own pound pegged to the pound sterling.

&gt; It doesn't seek to ""undermine"" the UK. Lowering corporate tax isn't an intentional effort to undermine the UK. It's a policy that's incredibly popular to Scottish sensibilities, a form of social corporatism, that doesn't sell in Westminster because it's full of millionaires. Adjusting our tax rates a little to encourage investment isn't undermining the UK, businesses will still be relatively attracted to the UK as more ""stable"" and I don't think it's mature, or economically valid, for English economists to think that Scotland doesn't need to offer additional insentive to survive.

Any attempt to undercut the UK in taxation is undermining it - a clear attempt to grab business that might currently locate in the UK (be it Scotland or elsewhere). It might be popular in Scotland, but it doesn't mean the UK should countenance it and help it along with a currency union.

Businesses might be attracted to either country. Both governments can work in the interests of their respective countries to gain investment, rather than the UK working in the interests of what would be a foreign country.

&gt; Yes, only a portion of the country would be affected. The North of England, despite getting lots of Scottish water, still suffers the occasional hose-pipe ban and other drought mitigation measures. For humanitarian reasons I doubt this would change very much, assuming England was willing to actually facilitate an Independent Scotland to some extent. However if we're assuming the vast measures of spite and competitiveness that you are I'm entirely sure that cities in the North of England would suffer near water-poverty in summer.

Can you cite a source that the north relies on Scottish water? I can only find articles discussing the possibility of having it piped down during the last south eastern drought, but nothing since, and they'll have hardly built anything in the last 18-24 months. As far as I'm aware, the only real ""foreign"" import is Welsh water in the Midlands.

Even so, I think it's not a safe assumption that Scotland would turn the tap off - they'll be happy with whatever we pay for it, and of course there'd be a bit of a PR nightmare if the North really was dependent on the stuff and they decided to put money or spite over basic human needs.

I'm not sure why it would be a big deal without a currency union, it's not exactly difficult for British business to buy food from European countries despite the completely different currencies. It would be even easier if Scotland simply had their own pound pegged to the pound sterling.

They do, but the fish that they catch are different and the scale of Scottish fishing is really large which means that currently many people use Scottish supply because of it's cheapness. The reason this comes into the currency union debate is about cross-border tax, and the idea that trade with Scotland would be hindered by a transaction tax is the main issue.

&gt; It would be even easier if Scotland simply had their own pound pegged to the pound sterling.

I agree. Sadly I don't write the Independence campaign, though these small details are not enough to make me want to stay apart of Westminster.


&gt;Any attempt to undercut the UK in taxation is undermining it - a clear attempt to grab business that might currently locate in the UK (be it Scotland or elsewhere). It might be popular in Scotland, but it doesn't mean the UK should countenance it and help it along with a currency union.

There are certain things that Scotland could not possibly undermine, due to the fact that many corporations will choose England based on population size and density instead of corporate tax. But the whole spirit of the Edinburgh agreement is to give Scotland autonomy, and yet the debate seems to say that Westminster would not really acknowledge or appreciate that autonomy on matters that deviate from Westminsters typical line. 


That's not very clear so I'll illustrate with example. Corporate tax and incentives are almost entirely politically motivated and determined. What we're seeing is Westminster acknolweding that Scotland should have a right to political autonomy if it chooses it (in the referendum). However what we're also seeing is before the referendum even happens Westminster saying that any deviation from their norms will be treated as an attack, or ""undermining"" them instead of just giving Scotland it's own distinct polity which many believe is a fundamental national right.


&gt;an you cite a source that the north relies on Scottish water? I can only find articles discussing the possibility of having it piped down during the last south eastern drought, but nothing since, and they'll have hardly built anything in the last 18-24 months.
Even so, I think it's not a safe assumption that Scotland would turn the tap off - they'll be happy with whatever we pay for it, and of course there'd be a bit of a PR nightmare if the North really was dependent on the stuff and they decided to put money or spite over basic human needs.

It's a difficult thing to find a specific story for as the details of water being sent to England will probably be internal company documents for Scottish water. The north doesn't ""rely"" on Scottish water but the infrastructure transports it freely and this helds with Englands slightly more unstable water-table. At the very least we can agree Scotland's abundance of water is a bit of a truism and also that there are frequently droughts in England.

&gt;Even so, I think it's not a safe assumption that Scotland would turn the tap off - they'll be happy with whatever we pay for it, and of course there'd be a bit of a PR nightmare if the North really was dependent on the stuff and they decided to put money or spite over basic human needs.

I think you're right on that one, but it's a negotiation card in what could be the PR nightmare of Westminster doing everything to prohibit an Independent Scotland from flourishing.

When I was growing up the Irish were seen as suspected terrorists ( sweeping generalisation but to support it I used to drink with Irish guys in the 90s and they were often stopped by police when out in town). 
The current celebrations are very much to do with the black stuff.  They promote heavily in bars, often those promotions are very good for the landlords, not just by getting people through the door but with discounted stock etc. 
I am not a fan of celebrating another countries patron saint but Patrick no more or less Andrew or David. 
As for St George's day.  After the far right and football hooligans stole the flag from us it is hard to celebrate without being associated with the morons.  
And I read comments about the empire etc. England was not alone in this.  Scotland was there too, and across the world European counties were making land grabs. 
But it's because English and British is seen as the same thing, such as in the comments about empire.  I'm an English man but then a child of the world before British.  Again, as an old fit, I remember the flag of the union being used for the English rather than the George cross.  Look at old football matches to see the change happen around 96.  If you google england flag and look at the images it still shows loads of union flags. 
So summing up a St George's Day celebration for England doesn't have the corporate sponsorship and identity to break free from nationalist over tones that it would currently bring.

'Football Factory' star hasn't taken kindly to BBC Radio 5 Live movie critic's parodies

Danny Dyer has claimed he would ""probably"" headbutt Mark Kermode if he ever met him after failing to see the funny side of the film critic's on-air impersonations. The Football Factory star claimed that the BBC Radio 5 Live broadcaster's impressions of him are inaccurate - you can judge for yourself by scrolling [up] and clicking [above].

Speaking to PureMovies.co.uk, Dyer suggested that there ""won't be no talking"" if he ever crosses paths with Kermode.

""It'll probably just be a headbutt straight to the fucking nose, and then he can go off and do his impressions with a broken nose. That'd be good, wouldn't it?"" Dyer commented.

He added that Kermode's perception of him is ""very odd"" considering the serious roles he's taken on throughout his career.

""I think he does tend to forget that I've done Pinter and stuff like that. I don't think he takes me seriously as an actor,"" Dyer said, referencing his stints in Harold Pinter plays Celebration and No Man's Land earlier in his career.

Positions needing strengthening I had LB, DM and CD. I would probably add RB at this point too, but otherwise I think that is mostly accurate. We need someone in place of Kolo at CD for next season.

Had Allen as needing to improve most from last season. He hasn't had the smoothest ride, but he has definitely improved. His performance yesterday was great.

All in all, I didn't do too horribly, but I was definitely overestimating United and underestimating Henderson.",0,1395086222,null,0,false,0,cg4zn92,t3_20mbqx,t1_cg4zn92,t3_20mbqx,null,1432948896,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Of course driving is not the best parallel to draw, but perhaps the a better would be the tension between drivers and cyclists, in this context 'professional' seamen are drivers, and leisure sailors are cyclists. Cyclists have a reputation for a general disregard for the rule of the road (almost certainly a minority, as it surely is in the leisure sailing community), but the drivers seem to bear a disproportionate amount of the risk and consequence for any accidents. (Except for the consequences physically of course.)

For example, Ellen Macarthur's single-handed sailing, while an incredible feat, is black-and-white illegal, but it just generally accepted. Frustrating.

Just to be clear, I don't think leisure sailors should be made, or even aspire, to be anything like professional sailors. We aren't perfect and I fully accept that. But I do find it mad any Joe off the street can buy a boat and tootle off, totally out of whack with our nanny state reputation.

Compared to those seasons he now plays a more commanding and 'slow' role. Right now he doesn't seem to be winning games on his own anymore (which is ok since our current team is superior to what we had in the last decade in my opinion).

Incredible player. Yesterday's performance reminded me of that wonderful article from the Guardian about the 'top top' chop. It said how Gerrard was expected to become this midfield general, but was lacked discipline and had too much attacking impact to be in a way limited to that. But yesterday, he was exactly that type of Keane or Vieira player. From the beginning of the game United tried to get stuck in, Gerrard won the ball numerous times, thundered in on Jones and Fellaini. Set the tone for us, protected us and led us.

One thing we could do is end such trusts - allow intergenerational trusts only in the case that they're doing genuine charitable works, and they're not just for the good of one family.

Shamrocks would often be worn, Catholics would attend mass, and the whole affair would be quite solemn. It is the anniversary of the death of St Patrick, after all. It was celebrated by Irish Protestants and Catholics alike, and for those who fast for Lent, it is a day outside those restrictions.

In the late 19^th century, an influx of Irish refugees to the USA and the rising tide of Irish nationalism lead to changes in the day. These refugees all had people they had left behind, alive and dead, and found themselves facing significant discrimination in the USA. In those circumstances, the day became a celebration of shared identity. It was then simple enough for solemn parades to become exuberant ones, and for a day of plenty in the middle of a religious fasting period to become a day of excess.

A hundred years on from that shift, Irish independence had become a reality and there had been an Irish American president. The Irish in America had become a large and prosperous group. Marketers had moved in and formed a symbiotic relationship with the parades and events - the more spectacular the parade, the more attention it will receive and the more alcohol sales will increase in the vicinity. The celebration spread from the Irish Americans to other Americans who wanted a parade, ten beers, and an excuse.

At around this point, the Irish government began to realize that they could capitalize on the American popularization of St Patrick's day. They have since been using it as a focus for events around the world, trying to raise the profile of Irish culture. 

They also imported the American tradition, as it attracts American tourists and their gold. The tourists usually mistakenly believe that the current style of St Patrick's Day is somehow traditional, or at least Irish rather than American in character, so they are surprised when the Dublin parade is smaller than that in Boston.

As a marketing holiday, it has now spread across the globe into just about every place with either a large Irish diaspora or a large group of people who want to spend a day getting drunk in face paint.

Neither St Andrew's Day nor St George's Day have the fortune of being celebrated in the middle of Lent. Neither of them were associated with a persecuted people or a significant independence movement in the 19^th century. Neither of them had the right pre-conditions to become a marketer's dream. Both of them remained niche holidays.

Mostly it amounts to minor inconvenience and only in very very rare cases any sort of damage or injury. 

I have experienced both sides, working on MCA coded boats with professional crews and being a Solent yacht racer in my spare time.

In my view many pros tend to consider leisure sailors an inconvenience which makes their job more difficult. I have seen them get angry at leisure boats breaking no rules simply for inconveniencing them.

&gt; ""why dont they just go behind me""

&gt; ""well they are stand on vessel""

&gt; ""so, they are just pissing about out here""

Is a not uncommon exchange. Because of this selection bias kick in and means they remember every time someone does break a rule and hold it against the community as a whole. Also as a minor aside, a lot of professional sailors on power vessels don't necessarily understand the challenges and quirks of manoeuvring a small boat under sail.

As for leisure users there is a huge variation in skill and knowledge levels, regular users in my experience tend to know the rules and have a healthy respect for commercial traffic (especially in the Solent) 

The problems are caused by those who use their boat 2/3 times a year and I agree the community has to work to educate and instil a safety concious ethos in these but given how rare this leads to a serious incident I don't think the burden of regulation is the answer.",0,1395092441,null,0,false,0,cg52q3m,t3_20melh,t1_cg52q3m,t1_cg4zvzr,null,1432950346,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,condeh,null,null,"&gt;Limits on behaviour =/= Censorship of media and esoteric material.

I am not sure how else to describe censorship. They are exercising their power to prevent you from viewing a media type, that's a limit on behaviour in my book.

&gt;I don't accept limitations on what I can eat. Who is imposing restrictions on what we eat beyond say the banning of food products that don't meet health guidelines (that could be still be imported anyway)?

You answered your own question. Just because it is possible to circumvent a limit doesn't mean the limit is non-existant.

&gt;Where are we being restricted in what we can wear?

I said '(or don't)' for a reason. Try walking down the street naked. Try entering a bank with a motorcycle helmet on. Try wearing a KKK outfit anywhere (ps. do the outfits they wear have names?) Try wearing a defamatory t-shirt. Limits exist on all of those.

&gt;Matter of public safety. Not comparable to censoring media content.

Still a limit on behaviour, widely accepted as being for the 'greater good'. Many view censorship in the same light.

&gt;I asked the question: Why should some books, films and television programs be censored either offline or online?
&gt;I ask this regardless of the internet. Why should they?

I am not saying they should, or shouldn't. I'm interested that basically no-one gives a hoot about the films that get banned, but censoring the internet provokes a much wider response. The question isn't why should they, because they already do. The question, to me, is why do people treat the internet as a special case instead of tackling censorship as a whole?

1. He wants more money, so wants to wait and negotiate

2. The club wants to give him more money (or less, if we don't make top 4) so they want to wait to negotiate.

&gt;The __Twelfth Doctor__ is an incarnation of [the Doctor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)), the protagonist of the long-running [BBC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) [television science fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) programme *[Doctor Who](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*. He is portrayed by Scottish actor [Peter Capaldi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Capaldi).  Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a [time travelling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel), [humanoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid) [alien](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life) from a race known as the [Time Lords](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lords). When the Doctor is critically injured, he can [regenerate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(Doctor_Who\)) his body, and in doing so gain a new physical appearance, and with it a distinct new personality; this plot mechanism has allowed the Doctor to be portrayed by a series of actors over the decades since the programme's inception in 1963.

I'm thinking Man City a few years ago. Remember them buying up talent and getting on their way to becoming a dominant force? A team with Tevez, Kompany, Adebayor and Zabaleta in it couldn't beat us to the Champions league. Kompany was a defensive midfielder when they bought him, now he's one of the best defenders in Europe. 


I'd ask that everyone keep this moment in mind, but from Man City's point of view: **City's directors, draped in sky blue scarves, applauded politely at the final whistle - but faces set in stone betrayed the scale of their disappointment. The Champions League was the target when Mancini replaced the harshly-dismissed Mark Hughes, and the question remains whether Hughes would have done any worse than the Italian with the vast resources on offer.**

Feels familiar...

Levy is going to spend in the summer, I'm sure of it. We will sell, I'm also certain, but we will bring in a couple of top class players, no matter what the finishing spot. Despite some of the noises coming out of WHL, I'd be surprised honestly if we sold any of the six players you mentioned. Levy will want *at least* to get his money back on players like Chadli and Capoue- but will he get it? Chadli could still go to the WC, so maybe. But who knows with Capoue.

Preventing someone from viewing a television show, reading a book, playing a video game, accessing particular esoteric content is censorship. But rational limits on behaviour are there, are limited on the basis that it harms others. Why is censorship ever acceptable?

&gt;I said '(or don't)' for a reason. Try walking down the street naked. Try entering a bank with a motorcycle helmet on. Try wearing a KKK outfit anywhere (ps. do the outfits they wear have names?) Try wearing a defamatory t-shirt. Limits exist on all of those.

Nudity I'll give you and on shirts that have hate messages on it.

I do not think that wearing a KKK-esque outfit would be specifically illegal, just socially unacceptable.

&gt;Still a limit on behaviour, widely accepted as being for the 'greater good'. Many view censorship in the same light.

Do you?

&gt;I am not saying they should, or shouldn't. I'm interested that basically no-one gives a hoot about the films that get banned, but censoring the internet provokes a much wider response

I do care about that personally and the internet allowing bans to be ignored and bypassed ensures that people are aware of censored material. Before the internet it was harder for more people to be aware of blatant censorship.

&gt;The question, to me, is why do people treat the internet as a special case instead of tackling censorship as a whole?

I'm glad to see him back but is this the first sighting of Louis since the Jimmy Saville story? I didn't hear Louis' take on the abuse revelations which I found suprising given he got so close to him; on his DVD he does a whole extra load of filming with him looking at other films in the series to allow Saville to give his opinions.

Michael’s analysis is good as always, even though painful reading as a Spurs fan.

He's right in that the midfield zone is our biggest problem. There has been a complete lack of consistency in team selection, which is hurting the overall fluidity and understanding in attack. The team, for all its possession, is completely blunt because without true understanding, they constantly play safe balls sideways and backwards to each other. It’s absolutely galling to me that with eight games to go we still do not have a clear best starting XI. It seems to change with every match, even without midweek games. Part of it has been us being unusually unlucky with injuries, but it has felt for most of the season that both Sherwood and AVB have just been randomly tinkering like a child playing with a Rubik’s Cube, hoping that eventually they’ll luck onto the right combination.

A big problem is overbuying in some areas such as central midfield (where it is hard to pick a single standout player who should always start), and a clutch moderately talented wingers, none of whom have true game-changing potential. No one save for Adebayor, Walker and Lloris are crying out to be picked through performances alone.

Michael’s right in saying that our deep-lying midfielders are two average people doing the job of one good player… had we bought a single player like Matic instead of two in Capoue and Paulinho, we’d arguably be in a much better position. The last minute transfer window cock-up of missing out on Moutinho looks more and more damning with each passing game.

At present, we have virtually no penetration from midfield into attacking zones, which is why Wenger can cynically sit deep all game and know we can’t hurt them. Adebayor has kept us fifth with sheer physicality and force of will alone, but performance-wise I’m still surprised we’re still above Everton and Man Utd.",0,1395099570,null,0,false,0,cg565hr,t3_20mkzs,t1_cg565hr,t3_20mkzs,null,1432952029,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"If we're going to persist with a stupidly high defensive line with no real pressure high up the pitch and a complete lack of vertical penetration, sadly a three man CB is our only real choice.

We're currently playing our fullbacks so high up the pitch and pinned so tightly to the wings that our two CBs are having to cover the entire width of the pitch on their own.  They regularly get split by through balls, dragged out of position by forwards, and then overrun by midfield runners bursting through.  Plus, our lack of forward thrust from our deep-lying CMs (Sandro/Demeble/Paulinho/Bentaleb) means that the ball is most often kept around the zone just in front of our CBs, which means if we lose possession at any point, we're immediately under threat.

We've given away so many cheap goals this way, and the first port of call of any manager who comes in during the summer is to tighten us up at the back.  We threaten so little in attack that we can't keep giving out shitty goals so easily.  72 seconds into Sunday's match and I knew we were pretty much screwed because we struggle to break down organised teams.  An early goal is like a death sentence for us.

A back five would be something I'd like to see tried until the summer.  Walker/Naughton and Rose/Fryers can be posted high up on the wing, joining the attack but manning the opposition wingers without constant threat of being caught out of position.  Against teams with a single striker, one of our CBs can bring the ball out of defence (most likely Vertonghen), and then screen the other two or drop back into position without possession.  Then we only need to play one CDM, with the rest of the players committing to attacking roles.

Juve often play this kind of system under Conte, and do it exceptionally well.  Although they do have better quality players than us all over the park, especially their midfield trio of Pirlo/Vidal/Pogba.

I'm not sure if it'll work, but I reckon it plugs a gaping hole in our current tactics, and can't really do any worse than a lot of the other formations we've attempted this year.

I hope I'm wrong, but it is a big presumption at this point in time.

Siggy I don't particularly rate (and with only 11 starting appearances for us this season, it doesn't seem like our managers do either).  He is moderately talented, but goes missing completely in most games.  He can be useful as a second striker because he can score the odd goal, but I wouldn't burden him with the playmaking responsibilities of a dysfunctional attacking side such as ours.

And Chadli has his place, but I don't know that it's as a CAM.  In a pinch, perhaps, but I'm yet to see a single decisive performance from him this season.

Basically, the other sides we're competing against have playmakers like Ozil, Cazorla, Silva, Nasri, Mata, Hazard, Oscar, etc.  We have no one up to their level yet, even though Eriksen is close.  And even if Eriksen is as as good as those names, you'll notice that the top teams have at least two midfield playmakers who play off each other to devastating effect.  One lone CAM with a bit of skill is not enough to break down organised teams in the EPL at present, which is precisely why we're struggling so much.

My grandparents and others like them are very adamant about instilling Irish pride and culture in every generation of offspring. Unfortunately for a lot of stupid people, that means getting drunk and wearing green things. We can't help our stupid people. I think that's a global problem. I think this resentment comes more from stupid people than anything else. I can tell you that I passed a slew of drunken 15 year olds in the train station this morning on their way to the parade. That's fucking stupid.  But for many of us, that's not what Irish heritage means and it's hard to ask us to think otherwise, since that pride and sense of history gives us a lot to base our existence on. 

For the rest of us, Irish identity has been pressed for a long time. Most Americans feel a loss for a cultural connection and hope to hold on to those ties as long as they can. And this is true whether you're Puerto Rican, Irish, German, Russian, whatever it is--most families here want to hold on to their heritage and not lose their family traditions and ties.  If you moved here, would you tell your grandkids that they were American, not Irish? Would you keep your political beliefs to yourself and not tell them how you feel about what's happening? 

All this said, I don't think I'd ever identify myself to an Irish person as Irish.  I will say that everywhere we went, from Portrush to Kinsale, anyone I met asked me if I was, or if my family was, or if I had some sort of relative from Ireland, so of course I said yes, with a caveat that I don't think that automatically makes me ""Irish"" or an expert on Irish politics. I was more interested in gaining perspective from citizens of the country than I was in voicing my own (and so I maybe subjected my husband to listening to hours of RTE while we were driving). 

Also, traveling is a luxury for most Americans. From the time I was little, I remember my mom talking about going to visit her family in Ireland and how she had always wanted to go (her mom was born in Cork, came here, had 9 kids, never had the money to bring her kids back to meet the rest of her family). Anyway, I only got the chance to visit last year, 30 years old and 15 years after my mom passed. It took me years to save for this trip, and I'm hoping that I can maybe go back in the next 10 years at some point.

Yeesh, apparently I can't say anything short. The point is, I think we have no choice but to appropriate when most of us can't travel and the only perspective we have comes from parents/grandparents. I try to be the better sort, so I hope you know the shitty kind is not all of us.

Quite a few became mercenaries for the Byzantines to the point that the Varangian Guard became primarily Anglo-Saxon. Many others fled to Scotland and Scandinavian countries.

But for the majority of the population that didn't have some status such as soldiers or nobility, they stayed and became serfs - there isn't really a huge genetic imprint from the Norman invasion as a result.

Their advisor sounds like a right twat (or simply didn't inform them correctly), because most advisors with half a brain would have simply told hem that they should have been fine as long as they signed on during the same day, whether they came in early or turned up late. As long as you call them and arrange a change of time, most job centres are pretty good about it.

You're only allowed two weeks off sick during any 12 month period. This doesn't actually mean two full weeks, but rather two signing on days. So if you're only ill for one day and miss a signing because of it, and this happens again within a year, missing a third day will get you a sanction.

For a player of Gerrard's age and experience, and considering he's worked with and won trophies under managers like Houllier and Benitez, even Dalglish, this is the biggest point of the article for me. For Stevie to have that much respect and to come out and speak that highly of BR suggests that there's genuinely something there. It's not just that he's inherited a squad with Gerrard and Suarez, made some smart signings like Sturridge, but that he's also tactically astute, has great man-management and all the other qualities that you'd want from a manager.

How many times have you see our CM players actually try a forward pass to our strikers other then Sandro once last week? None, because they aren't creative players.

Apparently the  average lifespan of a manager in the PL is 2 years, so he's not any more or less trigger happy than say, Abramovich), it's unbelievable that ruthless progress like this has been made. Yeah, eleventh richest club in the world sounds lofty and nice, but when you consider even Man U to be four times our size, it's a very respectable ship he's running. 

Being Levy, there's probably an endgame to all this, which is probably the stadium, allowing us to get more revenue from ticket sales and all. And like the post said, in a few years it's not hard to see Eriksen going elsewhere, but I'm sure by then we can pay higher wages, allowing us to keep our players. 

In all fairness, though, Bale and Modric went to *Real Madrid* of all places. If it was Manchester United (Carrick, Berba) or City (There's a huge ex-Arsenal population of Clichy, Nasri, once Kolo, etc.), it'd be another thing. Levy isn't stupid that he'd turn down Galacticos level fees. Even in that example, what a fucking leap Modric is from Carrick. Modric, one of the best midfielders in the world right now, had his breakout year with us. Not too bad for a club that was flirting with relegation ten years ago.

And while I agree that Lewa doesn't really dive much he certainly has if we're considering those dives (and for the record he rolled around on the ground like he'd been shot in that instance, not exactly ""not appealing"").
