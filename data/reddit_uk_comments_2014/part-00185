I actually live in Whitechapel, where those idiots were harassing gay people/people drinking etc., and it's also where the EDL and other morons target regularly. I get really pissed off with how the area is portrayed in the media and by people talking about it without ever having been here, let alone lived here!

If you believe the media/idiots, then Whitechapel is under Sharia law and anyone not obeying it gets beaten up. In reality that couldn't be further from the truth - there's little to no tension here at all. My street is a mixture of Muslim families and young people house shares, and everyone gets along fine! My Muslim next door neighbours are the most tolerant neighbours I've ever had, there's a mutual respect (also during Ramadan they bring us iftar leftovers so I'm pretty hyped for this month ha). Last night as people were leaving the famed East London Mosque after the Ramadan service, I was drinking on the street outside a pub directly opposite... no issues at all, just greetings from the worshippers leaving.

The trouble is that obviously nobody sees that unless they're here. The vision of it given to them is one of intolerant Muslims taking over the area, and that (possibly understandably) makes people angry and adds fuel to the Islamophobia. Someone in the rural north who has no day-to-day contact with Muslims reads that Muslims are taking over and persecuting white/christian/whatever people, and they repeat it to their friends and so on...

Brochu played for an AHL (minor league) team called the Portland Pirates during the late 90s to early 00s that my father had half-season tickets to. He is the Pirates all time leader in wins but he never got a real shot at the NHL because the Washington Capitals (the Pirates parent club) already had a solid staring goalie named Olaf Kolzig. Martin got called up to the big show a couple times but was never able to secure a starting job.

Martin Brochu retired without a single NHL win, but he will always be my favorite hockey player.

Hidden cameras are a big hassle. You have to go out of your way to buy and use them specifically for the purpose of surveillance.

Google Glass will provide all sorts of 'convenience' features, and assurances will be made about privacy and data collection to get people past the initial discomfort. Then once everyone is wearing them, Google will announce an amazing new feature that streams audio and video from the cameras 24/7 to their servers to improve Google Now, make your search results more personalised and link the people you're looking at to their social media accounts. Even if you turn off the uplink, backdoors will be built in so the authorities can start recording without your knowledge. Because the firmware at the very lowest-level will be non-free and proprietary (Qualcomm is very protective of their intellectual property) you won't be able to find and disable these backdoors. The UK privacy watchdog mentioned in the headline will take no notice of any of this.

I used to work the doors in Gorgie during match days at Tynecastle.

I used to live in Murieston Crescent and later Wardlaw Place too, no car breaks ins or house robberies or anything crazy. 

I would avoid most of the local bars like Lucky's or the Wheatfield Inn especially on match days but yes, Diggers aka The Athletic Arms is very nice though but a short walk from your place to Roseburn/Murrayfield will see you in some nice bars.  You're also not too far away from Slateford for a couple of okay boozers.

Gorgie is fine mate, it's the sort of place that if you're a troublemaker then trouble will find you but if not, you'll be just grand.

To your last bit, we have professional scouts and it seems they've seen Davies as our best option budget and talent wise. Clearly they'd like shaw or Rodriguez too, but they have to see something in him or else we wouldn't be in for him. I'm no scout myself but I like what I do recognize and the fact that the scouts agree gives me all the more confidence that Davies is a good option.

I'm not a Marxist myself but (as I do with nutty philosophies like post-modernism) sometimes you have to notice just how spot on it can be sometime. We are infinitely more manipulable than we think - some even argue it's an inherent frailty in the human brain; an inability to see macro-relationships the way they really are and thus unable to divine what your best interests are.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"Nope - the guns are in cars. They are normally called ""trojan"" units and are usually found in either blacked-out unmarked Range Rovers or more normally in BMW Saloons or X5s. They are distinguished by having an orange/yellow (can't remember which) circle easily visible on the sides, rear and roof of the cars.

The officers keep their pistols on them at all times, even on normal patrol, but their rifles are normally kept in a gun lockbox in the boot, or occasionally in the centre console of the car between the driver and the front seat passenger.

In other places in the UK they use different vehicles and don't have the orange/yellow dot, but the guns are still kept in lockboxes except for the pistols which stay on the officers at all times.

Officers are required to get authorisation to pre-emptively arm on someone they know will be dangerous, however if the situation they are in requires them to draw for any reason they don't have to ask to do so - they can shoot anyone that is threatening the life of someone else, if they can justify why they've done so. This is the same right that applies to anyone in the UK - you can use any justifiable force against anyone who is threatening the life of another, or yourself, as long as you are certain the suspect will kill or seriously injure the victim(s).",0,1404115849,null,0,false,0,cikowne,t3_29f1ji,t1_cikowne,t1_cikck39,null,1434474452,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

Aside from being the greatest book ever written and the only book I have heard from various people to make them literally laugh out loud on public transport - it also teaches you about bureaucracy and the insanity that it can cause, and that you should question it at all times.

A good overview of the themes

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1868619.stm

One issue with the book however is that all other books will seem inferior afterwards.

As the writer quoted

'When I read something saying I've not done anything as good as 'Catch-22' I'm tempted to reply, 'Who has?'

We are not allowed to carry or possess any object with the sole or main purpose of self-defence, however we are allowed to use reasonable and justifiable force to defend ourselves. Thus if you were coming home from a game of rounders or cricket and you had the bat in the car, and you were attacked, legally you could use the bat to defend yourself if the attacker had something similar, but if the police stopped you for a traffic offence and found the bat you couldn't tell them it was for self-defence.

This study also found that men showed lower levels of intimate partner violence (IPV) than they showed violence towards same-sex non intimates whereas in women the opposite was true.

It also found that lots of relationships where the partners are violent to another are mutual rather than one partner being the victim.

Another potential limitation of the study is that it only compares two categories of relationships, intimate partners and same sex non intimates.

&gt;Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

&gt;But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

Reading that as a wet behind the ears 20-something was a real light bulb moment for me.

true,PopeGregoryIX,eng-Cornwall,Kernow,"&gt;That question captures the essence of the problem. Why is a Christian ethos or a Jewish ethos acceptable in schools, but not an Islamic ethos?

&gt;The only rational answer, and the only possible justification for Ofsted banning what was going on in those Muslim Birmingham schools (which academically were excellent) is the one given by the straight-talking Allison Pearson of the Daily Telegraph, who boldly stated that our Western values are superior and must be thoroughly defended throughout the country.

This is somewhat weaselly. He's answering a different question to the one he quotes Martha Kearney asking earlier in the article. She asks : “would there be the same fuss if these were Catholic governors?”. He appears to assume that the actions of Catholic schools are radically different to those of the so-called Islamic schools. This may be true (although doubtfully) but the specific actions he condemns said schools for are:

&gt;The separation of boys and girls in class, with girls sitting at the back. Veil wearing. The call to prayer over loudspeakers throughout the school.

Clearly these are things that happen in some form or other in all religious schools. The segregation of boys and girls within the school system is as old as the hills and is carried out not just in religious schools but in secular schools. A call to prayer over loudspeakers? Firstly, so what? and secondly, is this really any different from the morning christian prayers said in school assemblies?

So the question really is: why is it alright for Christian/Jewish/Western schools to segregate boys and girls, and to heavily promote religion but not for Islamic schools? 

And the conclusion he comes to? It must be because Western religions/cultures are simply and inherently ""superior"". As if it's obvious. As if the people who espouse such arrogant rubbish are, in fact, brave and not just bigots and hypocrites. 

As always, it boils down to people not liking Islam, which in itself is fine. You don't have to like it, but in looking at the reasons why, we need to look at our own culture first and foremost. What exactly are they doing that we haven't been doing ourselves for hundreds of years?

From the article, 
&gt; Berkshire MP Benyon is a director of his family’s 300-year-old Englefield Estate, which owns 20,000 acres of land from Hampshire to Scotland.

&gt; Its portfolio includes the 250-property Benyon Estate in East London which is now a “minority shareholder” in the flats on the New Era Estate.

So the properties **haven't** been bought by the MP personally.

The MP is a director of a family firm, Englefield Estates, and that firm has bought a share of the estate here - it's not the outright owner either.

Looking at https://www.duedil.com/company/02065923/englefield-estate-trust-corporation-limited/people - the MP in question doesn't own the family firm either, it's owned by William Benyon &amp; Patrick William Mcgrath.",0,1404122896,null,0,false,0,cikq3t6,t3_29gc71,t1_cikq3t6,t3_29gc71,null,1434475206,77,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,77

All boys school and all girls schools are based on a different philosophy to separating out classes and the justification for a large number of them isn't religious in nature: that boys and girls could learn better with an entire school dedicated to a single sex. The only classes that get split up in normal schools are (usually very small parts of) sex education and PE, both of which are because of physical differences 

In Islamic schools, separating out pupils isn't done because of potential educational benefits, it's done because mixing pupils is seen as indecent and immoral.

I agree that there are plenty of aspects of Islamic culture which are negative and I am happy to support these arguments where they are present. 

If you want to, though, lets. 

Islam is not the only religion that condemns homosexuality and Islamic countries are not alone is legislating against it. Here's a list of countries in which homosexuality is illegal:

http://76crimes.com/76-countries-where-homosexuality-is-illegal/ 

Also, just because Islamic governments in other countries are anti-gay to this extent, does not mean that Muslims living in the UK are. It's that kind of assumption that makes arguments definable as bigoted. You cannot simply say that every member of a specific culture will have the same views. If they did, given that we are from the same country, I would be agreeing with you.

The point I was making is not the Islam is wonderful, but that western culture is not automatically better (or even, necessarily, that different). We do need to look at what children are being taught in schools in terms of their cultural values, but this should be across the board. We all need to be better.

This is laughably stupid. I know the Shia community very well, I used to be one. They are a bunch of pussies, and they have never done anything remotely resembling like what is suggested. It's simply not in their character. Plus, how would they know who's going to Syria? Stupid suggestion.

Sunnis, on the other hand, have already attacked Shias in this country and will likely do it again, in quite a serious way. Sunnis are violent and have the balls and conviction to actually do things.

Of course not. However they should not have influence on policy or legislation which directly impacts on their business interests. If this means that more than 50% of parliament can't vote on BTL legislation then that's a significant problem for our democracy isn't it?

Instead, if people have knowledge of an industry they should be the ones putting together the reports and analysis which goes infront of other MPs and based on their recommendations. People are always talking about a more meritocratic approach to policy making, this would be conducive towards that.

&gt;The challenge is probably to get more MPs from the non-management classes so you get a broader range of financial interests represented but that is a massive stretch with the current system.

Business, Law and Finance make up the 3 biggest qualifications of the Conservatives and Lib Dems. Labour's surprisingly is Media (maybe explaining their luvvie approach to education?). [Source](http://www.smith-institute.org.uk/file/Who-Governs-Britain.pdf)

 I have a deep understanding of their culture and beliefs from having been part of the community for a very long time (but I'm still young enough to have my finger on the pulse of the sentiment of the youth). Muslims don't spontaneously commit acts of violence, they get radicalised. Shia radicalisation is a whole different thing to Sunni radicalisation, completely different· The religion and culture is different. They really are like two different religions, which to outsiders is not obvious.

My gut feeling is that MI5 and co. spend a lot of time chasing useless leads. They probably don't understand Muslims, the culture is too alien to them.

In cases where other schools are seen to be over stepping the boundary of religious indoctrination, we treat these as isolated problems which need to be rectified and progressed from. When Muslims do it we assume that they are trying to take over the country and make us all into Muslims. This view is preposterous.

What we need to understand about all religions, is that the people who believe in them are simply doing what they think is right. They want their children to follow their rules because they genuinely believe there is no other option.

They get *gigantic* tax exemptions on their fibre infrastructure that no other company does. Virgin Media get a lesser tax break, again, for no particular reason. It's totally political and totally corrupt.

A decent analysis is here: [Link](http://br0kent3l3ph0n3.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/how-bt-scores-in-the-fibre-rates-wars/)

&gt;The current rateable value applied to Other Operators is £230 per fibre pair-kilometre. On a multiplier of 45.2% for 2012/3, this gives rise to a tax charge of £103.96 per pair, or £51.98 per fibre.

&gt;Other Operators therefore pay some 18.43 times the rate paid by Openreach for link fibre on a FAC, and some 49.98 times that on a LRIC basis. If BT’s measure of link fibre was per fibre pair, then the difference would be 37 times and 100 times respectively.

It makes you wonder about the influence of our own society on their views. We are by no means a nation of 100% pro-homosexuality. There are non-Muslim sections of our society that would argue that homosexuality and sex before marriage are against traditional British values (some of them in the government).

Say we gave Poch £30m + sales (could be more, i can't remember the figure quoted by papers) to make moves.  We just sold Jake for somewhere between £7m - £8m meaning that Davies would be brought in without affecting our original amount of a transfer pot.

Looking at it we will have sold Jake, a player who wasn't going to make the cut in our deep midfield group, and replaced him with Davies, a young player who fits into our weakest position.

Seems like solid business.  

I would take Davies over Rose simply for the fact that Davies is a more defensively aware LB than Rose as it stands and then working with Poch i think he can really thrive (and to be fair i think there is a chance that Rose could have a revival under Poch as well).  Seems like good business to strengthen a position of weakness.

&gt;The __Can-can__ (sometimes non-hyphenated as in the original French: __cancan__ French pronunciation: ​[kɑ̃kɑ̃]) is a high-energy and physically demanding [music hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_hall) dance, traditionally performed by a [chorus line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorus_line) of female dancers who wear costumes with long skirts, [petticoats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petticoat), and black stockings. The main features of the dance are the lifting and manipulation of the skirts, with [high kicking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_ballet_terms#Battement) and suggestive, provocative body movements. The *Infernal Galop* from [Jacques Offenbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Offenbach)'s *[Orpheus in the Underworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orpheus_in_the_Underworld)* is the tune most associated with the can-can.

I'd say that the actual violence is rarely the issue, I doubt many of these end in death, but that the constant threats and intimidation cause psychological problems. I think this will be equivalent in both cases but men typically don't seek help for this.

To quote Wikipedia:

The problem arises where the two parties have different interests and asymmetric information (the agent having more information), such that the principal cannot directly ensure that the agent is always acting in its (the principal's) best interests, particularly when activities that are useful to the principal are costly to the agent, and where elements of what the agent does are costly for the principal to observe. Moral hazard and conflict of interest may arise. Indeed, the principal may be sufficiently concerned at the possibility of being exploited by the agent that he chooses not to enter into a transaction at all, when that deal would have actually been in both parties' best interests: a suboptimal outcome that lowers welfare overall. The deviation from the principal's interest by the agent is called 'agency costs.'

Why do I raise this?

Because the BMA wants increased funding in the same way as everyone who is lobbying for more money does. As one of the best ways they have of doing so is to claim that the NHS is under threat and underfunded. This applies not just to the BMA, but campaigners, nurses, doctors, and politicians aiming to acquire political capital.

The question I'm basically asking is: how do we know this isn't just a campaigning technique? Because the head of the BMA would be saying this irrespective of if it were true if he got political capital and money from it.

The NHS already does procure a lot (practically everything) from the private sector, the issue is that outside of the provision of care it's actually pretty rubbish at doing a lot of those things. Regardless I've yet to see a single case where adding additional layers of management and complexity, which privatisation introduces, has lead to positive outcomes. Ultimately in every case either the service has ceased to exist or the taxpayer had to bail out the private sector through tax breaks or direct intervention. Even the energy sector has pretty much failed to construct sufficient infrastructure to meet the UK's energy demands because it is *always* more cost effective to create artificial scarcity and ramp up prices than to compete.

&gt;If there was a compelling case for reducing funding for Higher Education in the national interest, or for opening up the NHS to private providers, would you expect Huppert and Wollaston to vote impartially if they knew it meant a reduction in their terms and conditions as NHS / University employees? If the criticism is that MPs will vote in their self-interest rather than for the right policy the same surely applies to the two examples above?

I fail to understand how people can simultaneously hold a full time job as an MP as well as work elsewhere. That screams conflict of interest by it's very nature.

In the UK, we spend about $3405 per head on healthcare. Again, take the nominal UK GDP/capita of $43,830 and we get a figure of about 7.8%. 

Obviously this is not a fair comparison in itself because, as nations we have different healthcare models and social welfare systems. But the fact remains that other, more successful (economically speaking) countries are capable of pouring more of their national budget into healthcare without setting up a huge deficit.

Please enlighten me. NB: I'm neither German nor French, and I've lived in 5 different EU countries and am pretty familiar with their politics.

What are those ""EU interests"" and how do they ""subsume"" their national interests?

Believe me: each country plays very hard bargains in the EU. This is why Spain hasn't joined the EU unitary patent, why Sweden is outside the ""reinforced cooperation"" in matters concerning divorce, or why France has so far managed to ensure that the European Parliament remains in Strasbourg, to cite but three quick examples.

The image of the ""plucky Brits standing to Brussels"" while everybody else demurs is a ridiculous and misleading caricature.

Thank you, and *yumm*, yes please.  

Switzerland has of course built its treaties one on top of the other over years, so of course it makes sense that if they pull one it is like a game of Jenga, and it builds as it develops...but then we'd be starting in 2014 with a very much now centralised EU (which is part of the reason for wanting to leave in the first place).  Our bilateral trade agreement could be a very simplified AA deal - which the pro-federalists in the Union of European Federalists have already offered the UK as a get-out-of-the-way carrot.

So in doing what Switzerland has done, but applying it to the UK in 2014+, and under Article 50 and not drawn out, then it'd be a lot cleaner, crisper, and simpler.

Don't really need the good luck, of course.  After all, Switzerland was a net, reliant *exporter* to the EU.  The UK is a net *importer*; a trend which is growing.

&gt;Wishfull thinking. What makes you think the UK will have more influence i n the common wealth?

Not influence in the commonwealth.  We're not jumping from one political union to another!

More influence at the WTO.    
Do I think we have more in common with Commonwealth countries that many European countries on several counts?  Yes, because by hook or by crook we exported much of our legal, political and domestic systems, along with aspects of our language and common culture to them.  In a nation sense today's UK shares a common ancestor with much of the Commonwealth.  

What makes me think the UK would have greater influence at the WTO?  Well, we'd be able to have a seat beyond being an observer, for a start.

&gt;The empire is over...

Y'up, thank God!       

Barroso on the other hand has called the [EU an empire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2Ralocq9uE).  It is protectionist, expansionist, and increasingly destabilising.  Only what Barroso calls a non-imperial empire, and the reasons he gives for it, doesn't quite ring true when we look at treatment of Ireland, Greece, Italy, Cyprus, overturned referendums, the nature of Lisbon's passing,...



&gt;UKs abilities to shap eoutcomes on the world stage is extremely limited, especially as we look further into the future.

Also, thank God.  I want to trade with it.  Not adopt it or rule it.  Been there, done that.    
The US used to be known for it's political isolationism.  The Bush Doctrine and the whole world stage Kissinger has been an unmitigated disaster.   

&gt;The EU has 7 times the GDP of the UK.

And pretty much 7x the problems and types of economy all pulling it apart.   Small is the new beautiful.

Russia has roughly 7x the GDP of Switzerland, Norway or Singapore.  Where would you rather live?    

[Even the EU admits flexible has its strengths...](http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/danielhannan/100255422/proof-at-last-eurocrats-secretly-admit-that-countries-are-better-off-out/?fb)

But as a global power the protectionist EU is actually on the wane.  When Britain joined the EEC in 1973, Western Europe was 36% of the world economy. Today it's 24%. In 2020 it'll be 15%.  Only this week we've had two reports that show that UK membership of EU's Single Maket has no lasting benefit, and 'No Evidence' that being in EU brought foreign investment to the UK as opposed to being out.

&gt;&gt;increasingly less UK-representative EU delegation.

&gt;That's what democracy is about.

That's what EU democracy and sovereignty is about.   
If we had UK democracy and sovereignty we'd have more UK representation because we wouldn't be going through an EU delegation.

&gt;No nation holds anywhere near a majority in Europe. You are represented proportionaly. Seems like that's not enough for you.

No.  It is not.  But then again I don't want to rule either.  I want to leave (and it's all coming together nicely too).

&gt;For better or worse a British exit would also accelerate EU integration, too, resulting in an internationally much stronger EU.

Good luck to them in return.  None of my concern.

&gt; Society and culture of the time, in that area, created the ""hood"" culture.


Perhaps you missed the point here, no one is ""passing the buck"", this virulent anti social problem exists in all western post industrial countries, it is not unique to Northern Ireland.

&gt; It's what happens when there is no real police presence

In most societies it is still the police services duty to uphold the law not ignore it to spy on the **whole community**

&gt; Of course the ""hoods"" were going to talk about the people who shot and beat them. You can't claim it's ""touting"" as they were not being disloyal or defectors of any sort. The ira was their enemy.

It was the Community who demanded that the IRA fulfill the role left the absence of of Normal Policing, **it is a mistake to believe their was no police presence; there was, they simply didn't tackle crime**. In every working class nationalist district there were highly fortified military style compounds used by the police as well as an extensive surveillance networks. They deliberately used existing social problems to further antagonise entire communities not simply Republicans. Hoods were in fact encouraged to carry out their activities, many of them having been arrested for serious crimes would be free the same day. It is in these circumstances that the IRA was dragged into a policing role.

&gt; The ira created ""hoods"". That whole DAAD period created the most joyriders ever.

Would you care to qualify this statement? Have you got figures handy or did you assemble this random ""fact"" in your imagination?

[DAAD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Action_Against_Drugs) operated for around five years targeting and assassinating high profile **drug dealers**, they did not target random drug users that is simply absurd, as well as an impossible task. Joyriding is a separate anti social problem.

The Republican movement was well aware of the negative impact that it would have if it continued in this capacity, it sought to redress the issue by using non punitive means. It began programs such as the [Community Restorative Justice](http://crji.ie/about/history/) initiative. This response began in the early nineties with discussions between Academics and the Republican movement around alternative measures to deal with anti social behaviour. 

A consequence of this debate was that violent responses to anti social behaviour was counter productive, in that for hoods, it was a badge of honour to have been maimed, it gave them a sense of legitimacy and purpose as well as bragging rights among their peers. This theory is covered extensively in this [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Hoods-Crime-Punishment-Belfast/dp/0691119635)

&gt; In The Hoods, Heather Hamill explains why this informal system of policing and punishment developed and endured and why such harsh punishments as beatings, ""kneecappings,"" and exile have not stopped hoods from offending. Drawing on a variety of sources, including interviews with perpetrators and victims of this violence, the book argues that the hoods' risky offending may amount to a game in which hoods gain prestige by displaying hard-to-fake signals of toughness to each other. Violent physical punishment feeds into this signaling game, increasing the hoods' status by proving that they have committed serious offenses and can ""manfully"" take punishment yet remained undeterred. A rare combination of frontline research and pioneering ideas, The Hoods has important implications for our fundamental understanding of crime and punishment.

Gone are the days when elected officials ordinarily have degrees and experience in their chosen sector. Education secretaries without a shred of experience in education. Business secretaries without a business degree...

We have to have a system that is not disproportionately stacked against any other sector of people but our current system is anything but that. Very few MP's in the house of commons came from an ordinary background. Most of them are from Eton for crying out loud! 

A position of great responsibility has slowly morphed into a position of great privilege, with entitled wankers passing legislation which benefits their friends first, and no one else second. This trend must be reversed because if the house of commons is fully staffed by elitist assholes, then how is anything ever going to work for the common person ever again?

The answer is, it won't. That's why this article happened. There are people in charge of this country without a frame of reference for how ordinary people live their lives, and consequently, they make decisions like the one in this article. How could they have an understanding of 'real life' if all they know is teak-panelled mansions, butlers and summer homes in St Tropez?

I think your figures are a little off, the 13.8% rate only kicks in on earnings over £153/week (EDIT: mistaken about the rest) and then it goes to 2% at £805. Anyway, let's pretend we don't have thresholds and so on:

If it were merged, the employer would make a contribution of 13.8% on your salary and you'd be taxed at 32% up until you earn over the higher threshold, then the rest would be taxed at 42%, with the employer continuing to make the 13.8% contribution.

The tricky bit is actually the different thresholds making everything overly complicated. It'd make far more sense to join up the income tax and NI bands and then apply employer contributions on the same basis.

Another thing is that NI is calculated on a weekly earnings basis rather than annual.

I guess you could look at buying somewhere near where you intend to go to university, rent it out for a couple of years then move in while studying (having housemates whose rent covers your mortgage). That would mean you'd make a considerable saving on housing costs while studying, maybe even a small profit.

At the end of your university course you'll then have 5-6 years of equity built up in the property and will hopefully still have a good portion of your student loans intact.

It sounds like you want to be saving up cash in interest-bearing accounts but not, at this point, investing it (where your capital is at risk). This is a call for you to make, but it sounds like the money would be best employed, for now, as an emergency fund and to help you avoid any non-student-loan debt while at university. (UK student loan debt has characteristics which make it less bad in many ways than other forms of debt.)

If I were you I'd make sure I took advantage of as much of my ISA allowance as I could (up to £15k this tax year). However, since there are generally higher interest rates availably on non-ISA accounts (in particular, current accounts and ""regular saver"" savings accounts) I would look to put it in these and then move it into an instant-access ISA (as cash, not stocks and shares/etc investments) before the cut-off in April 2015.

You'll have to look at what offers are available on accounts and what you qualify for. Moneysavingexpert has a comparison page on these. A couple of points to note:

* You can generally satisfy requirements re monthly deposits my having a coupleof standing orders bounce the requisite amount out into an account with a different institution, and back, each month.

* You may need a certain number of direct debits set up. I don't *think* these generally need to actually take money on a monthly basis. Personally, I use direct debits that pay off my credit card balances to do this. If you have at least one credit card but need more for this purpose consider applying for another credit card (with no fees) from the same provider (usually under a different brand - eg I have an MBNA card and an Amazon.co.uk card which is also provided my MBNA) - then (in my experience) you're already ""approved"" if you just transfer some of your credit limit over. As always, watch out for fees and don't pay interest on your credit card balances (pay in full each month).

(If you don't have the time and inclination for this it wouldn't be a completely stupid idea just to stick it into the highest interest instant-access cash ISA you can find - but I think it's worth understanding and optimising your personal finances - it's a good habit to get into.)",0,1404136813,null,0,1404137100,0,cikt85s,t3_29gw6g,t1_cikt85s,t3_29gw6g,null,1434477256,3,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,3

true,UnfortunatelyEvil,hartnell,Hartnell,"I'm not saying you are wrong, and in fact that may very well be true.

I am saying that I would disagree with that decision~ There are three things different between now and then. 

* The first is that the show has history now. Even with all the continuity problems, most have built upon the past, with minimal ret-conning, trying to build up the story, keeping it entertaining, and fixing problems that were not foreseen at creation. Now, the show is established, and the things that need to be changed are more in tune with keeping the show 'current'.
* Secondly, the connected fandom is HUGE. We were actually able to get a world-wide simulcast netting [77 million viewers](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Doctor_%28TV_story%29#Ratings). Now, [the 3rd &amp; 4th Doctors had more average viewers than the new Doctors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials#Overview_of_seasons_and_series), which brings us to this point: While many generations have been obsessed with continuity (Need I mention Sherlock Holmes' fandom?), my generation (Gen Y) has a huge advantage in the internet. Every current fandom and many past ones have Wiki's dedicated to them. Before, we had Dr Who Fact Books, if we noticed something that wasn't in there, it was up to us to get the word out via word-of-mouth, or writing letters in to suggest it to the next fact books. With a wiki, we have an immediate place to look to see if anyone else noticed it, and get immediate feedback when we suggest it. Add in all the various fan-forums (this subreddit has 200k subscribers), and tiny things can explode into huge debates much faster than ever before.
* Third: Again with my generation, I've noticed (in my limited experience) that a lot of people my age care about where things came from. Seeing something we like leads us to want to see what came before. With video games this gets into playing the originals. With movies, there are always groans about remaking old movies, regardless of if they were good or bad. This could just be unique to me and the fandoms I enjoy, so a very limited point here.

All together &amp; **tl;dr**, I feel the show has led towards continuity being important. Whenever something came up, they tried to change things to make sense in-universe. Going out and stating that we don't know much, so we can't complain when he changes something (if that is what he did) sounds a lot like he doesn't care about what came before. So, he doesn't get a free pass to do whatever he wants, instead what he wants has an uphill battle to be so good that trashing the past is worth it. And to be honest, nothing he has done has impressed me to that extent (even though I am impressed with a lot that has occurred).",0,1404137270,null,0,false,0,ciktdp6,t3_298zb3,t1_ciktdp6,t1_ciisy4v,null,1434477364,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;Britain’s housing crisis is worsened by weak legal protection for private tenants, who can be forced out of homes they have lived in for years at a few weeks’ notice.

ok, so in the UK you have to give either two months and two weeks notice to a tennant if you are evicting them for a legal reason (EG they broke the contract). If there's no legal reason, that means you give 2 months notice as well. Assuming you've done nothing wrong, that's 60 days notice you get.

Now, there's nothing actually stopping you from ignoring the notice completely, and the landlord has no legal right to bring in bayliffs once two months have passed. If you decide to stay, they will need to apply for ""accelerated posession"". When they do this, you get another 2 weeks notice once it actually gets through, even if the landlord has done everything right. It will also take about a month for the court to grant the notice in the first place. So far, 104 days have passed since the eviction process started. 

*then*, after these 14 days have passed, you will be granted either 14 or 28 days to leave the property (42 in exceptional circumstances, but that's unusual). Even if the landlord does *everything* legally, either 118 or 132 days have passed since they first gave notice. At this point, they can get bayliffs in to forcibly evict you. 


Tennants don't have ""weak legal protection"" at all, they get 4 months notice unless they've done something wrong and even then, they get 3. Nobody gets evicted after 'a few weeks', that's horse shit.

From my knowledge, the people you may need to speak to would be Openreach. They deal primarily with the installation and upgrade side of broadband. There could be a multitude of reasons though that they cannot install fibre optic or improve what you have currently. If new cable is required, the local council could be blocking it on grounds of cost or conservation.

I think to say that BT ""don't care"" is a bit harsh. BT have no control over the installation/upgrade of broadband services and will be limited to what Openreach of installed or been allowed to install.

Eccleston was the best at relaunching the show. Without him I don't believe the show would have gained the momentum it needed, he was awesome. I don't really think any of them sucked, nor do I believe any of the companions sucked, you're taking away from the show if you judge harshly on a companion or Doctor because you're not focusing on what the show is meant for, you're just finding irrational ways to make what you like about the show look better to you. Tennant was my personal favorite Doctor and the one I believe is ""THE"" best doctor, his portrayal of the Doctor showed what it meant to be the Doctor the most. Matt Smith had the most mind blowing arcs and stories. He's GREAT but just shy of Tennant, personally.

How do they exert that ""dominance""? Mind control? The reality is that Germany, France, Italy and the UK have each the same number of votes in the Council (which means that Germany is seriously underrepresented, BTW). Together, Germany and France have just 58 votes out of 352 in the Council.

At the European Parliament, Germany has 99 seats and France 72. The UK and Italy also have 72 each. Together, Germany and France have 171 seats out of a total of 736 (and MEPs rarely vote along national lines).

Moreover, there are plenty of matters on which Germany and France disagree and vote differently. Right now, Germany has a center-right chancellor, and France a center-left president and PM. France wanted Eurobonds, whereas Germany was dead set against them, and won that argument.

&gt; EU interests are those which either the EU or majority voting block in the EU have which differ from the national interests of states. In case you hadn't noticed, the EU is not a homogeneous group.

I *had* noticed, and that was my point: if the EU is not a homogeneous group, how can it have ""EU interests"". There isn't a stable ""majority voting group"" either: different coalitions form on different subjects, and the UK is in fact pretty often on the majority side.

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"The whole paedophilia hysteria only really started around the late 80s/early 90s - before that it wasn't exactly *classy* for people to sexually molest a young teenager or pubescent adolescent, but it also wasn't exactly the ""burn him as a witch on the merest allegation"" instinctive social taboo it is these days.

As such (and especially given much of this stuff apparently happened in the 60s and 70s) people generally had a much more... robust attitude to inappropriate sexual touching, sexual harassment and the like - it was generally swept under the carpet or treated as a bit of a joke or an amusing sexual peccadillo, especially if you were famous.  Exaggerating both tendencies for illustration, Jimmy Saville groping a teenager's boob would have been greeted with less ""oh my god you poor dear - you're a victim now so we'd better book you some therapy and hopefully in time you can agonisingly scrape your ruined life back together and be a whole person again"" and more ""... so what?"".

I remember reading a really interesting article on the history of child pornography that said it wasn't *that* unusual to see naked images of underage teenage girls on porn sites until the mid 90s, because in many places the laws and culture simply didn't prohibit it.  Even relatively ""classy"" places like MetArt(sp?) apparently used to feature 15 and 16 year-old models when it first started, and they were phased out during the 90s as attitudes gradually changed and the modern paedophilia hysteria got into full swing.

Remember, we're judging their behaviour in a social context that's informed by fifty years of women's rights, sexual harassment legislation, education on the issues surrounding consent and ""rape culture"", etc.  At the time they were committing most of these crimes (and certainly at the time they were establishing their patterns of behaviour and personal sense of morality around such issues) none of that had happened.  **That's not to say we're wrong to judge them**, but it does explain why so many of these well-known figures have these kinds of skeletons in their closets.

Society was a very different place back then - it wasn't until [1976](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_Offences_\(Amendment\)_Act_1976) that we even *had* a statutory definition of rape, and non-consensual sex within a marriage [wasn't even defined as rape](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marital_rape#England_and_Wales) until 1991(**!**) in England and Wales.

**None of this excuses what they did for even a second**, but it might serve to explain why so many of these previously beloved and cherished public figures are now being outed as sex-offenders and paedophiles - sexual harassment/coercion just wasn't seen as so much of a taboo at the time, and the age of consent wasn't necessarily treated as such a rigid dividing line as we conceptualise it these days - more a question of decency and good taste than an absolute ethical barrier that only a morally-vacuous monster would cross.

Given all that it's not surprising either that famous celebrities at the time (let's be honest, a class of people who are hardly *unknown* for their sense of entitlement or their sexual dalliances) were a lot more sexually coercive and indulged in sexual harassment or even straight-out rape a lot more than you'd expect now, *or* that the ages of their victims (which often correlates to both their vulnerability and responsiveness to coercion) included a lot of younger teenagers and even kids that today no healthy adult would even *consider* as a possible sexual partner.

Again: **none of this excuses anything** - I offer the comment only to try to explain why we're suddenly seeing a rash of retroactive prosecutions of famous figures from the 60s, 70s and 80s who were apparently indulging in behaviour that we now find incomprehensibly disgusting and abhorrent, instead of merely ""risque"" or ""a bit off"".",0,1404141615,null,0,1404147876,0,cikv3fw,t3_29h0o2,t1_cikv3fw,t1_cikt9ur,null,1434478593,145,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,145

For getting between cities trains will be readily available and will take you into the city centre, and you won't have to mess about trying to find, and pay for parking - which is almost always ridiculously expensive in cities, and the traffic is never fun.

Wales has an abundance of beautiful and dramatic scenery, if you like that sort of thing, I'd say Snowdon is worth a visit.  You can get a train up to the peak of Snowdon from Llanberis which is a picturesque village depsite being touristy,  and would basically cover some of the best scenery in Wales, and get you to the peak of the highest point in Wales:

Alternatively, you could walk if, if you like a good stout walk.

That said, you will also find some gorgeous scenery all over the country, and the Lake District and plenty of Scotland will provide you with amazing vistas too (except, think small scale I guess - we're smaller than most countries) so I wouldn't stress it too much, tbh :)

&gt;To be able to say that it definitely didn't affect the outcome is to say that it couldn't possibly have done so. Or to turn it around, if there is the possibility that it could have affected the outcome, then you can't say that it definitely didn't. 

Huh? If you falsely claim that you committed a crime and you were found not guilty, it seems pretty clear to me that your false claim *didn't actually* affect the outcome (unless you're suggesting that the person would have been found guilty if they hadn't admitted to it). 

However it also clearly *could have* influenced the outcome - the person *could have* been found guilty as a result of that claim.

Since his work with the institutions for so long, we can presume their administrations were either unaware of his crimes or even permitted them to go on.

There's an interesting paragraph in that interview:

&gt;“And all my people, at Leeds Infirmary, at Broadmoor, Stoke Mandeville, were all ringing each other up saying ‘Here. What’s wrong with the Godfather?’ They thought I was sickening for something.""

It sounds as though he had a network of people around him within these hospitals who were looking after him. They were in the perfect positions to assist and cover for him. Especially if they were higher up in the hospitals administration. They would have been able to discourage patients and staff from going to the police of the papers, and if any did, they could then lie to them.

This is more plausible than a government whitewash, because it involves fewer assumptions (Occam's razor).

If you're in Pennsylvania you could count yourself as one of the ""original"" supporters of the new NYCFC, who join MLS next year.

I've been a Hammer fan for about 12 years now. If you're glory hunting, this isn't the place for you. The team will let you down as often as it excites you, but it's that roller coaster that makes the team so endearing to most. Familiarize yourself with the squad and their tactics. We generally play a single target man up top with a ""route one"" style under Big Sam. Some people hate it, but it has proven very effective at times. A lot of fans (myself included) are hoping for some variety in the attack this fall. Sam is stubborn by nature and doesn't ever seem to want to change tactics if one isn't working. We all hope that changes.

Mark Noble is kind of the golden boy of the current group. He's an East Londoner by birth and grew up idolizing greats like Bobby Moore and Geoff Hurst. He came up through our youth academy and has now spent the better part of a decade with the first team. He's a classic box-to-box midfielder who will cover every blade of grass over the course of a match. Winston Reid is our most talented player, a dominant centre back and one of the better ones in the Premier. Then there's Ravel Morrison, a former Manchester United youth player with all the potential in the world, but a few screws loose upstairs. A lot of us are biting our nails over what becomes of him. Finally, Andy Carroll is our oft-injured centerpiece. The best aerial winner in the world, but also prone to banging himself up in the process. We pay him an outrageous amount of money and thus far he hasn't really lived up to the billing. Hopefully a full season of fitness changes that this year.

No, I immediately said that ""my explanation was a bit off"" and I accept that. However, you seem quite determined that if it wasn't completely accurate, it was ""entirely invalidated"", which I reject. My original point had at least two elements:

- That the statement must be material; it is not enough for it simply to be false. This is true.
- That it will only have been material if it led to the outcome. This is false. It will have been material under those circumstances, but it will also have been material if somebody relied on that statement and not doing so *might* have led to another outcome.  

As far as I can infer from the rest of your post, the crucial point that you're missing is that somebody has to have relied on the statement for it to be material. If you said ""I committed the crime"" during a procedure, it would only be material if somebody involved in the procedure acted or chose not to act in reliance on that statement.

However he's a good defender, has a good work rate, and makes great late runs into the box. He suffered from our slow playstyle last year. Bentaleb us great. Seriously, the kid is good. Hes great defensively. His positioning and tackling are way better than you'd expect from someone with his age and experience. When playing in a deeper role, he passes safely and quickly. When playing further forward, his passing has been suitably more ambitious. He raw still, and could use some.more.development, but he's a good player already. Dembele plays slow. That's my only complaint with him. He's incredibly string on the dribble, can shoot well when he wants to. He's just not a playmaker. Townsend gets way too much shit for his shooting. After his initial spell in the first team where it seemed like that's all he did, he stopped completely. Sig is surplus to requirements.

true,Shaper_pmp,null,null,"The reason I refer to it as hysteria is not to diminish the evil of child abuse - it's to differentiate between a reviled and hated social phenomenon that we all agree is unacceptable but *can reason calmly and rationally about* and a reviled and hated social phenomenon that we all agree is unacceptable that hits us at *such a fundamental, core part of our psyche* that we tend to lose all sense of perspective and start making emotional, non-rational, knee-jerk judgements and decisions that we would never even consider in any other context.

Paedophilia is the dominant popular contemporary hysteria of our age.  That's not to say it isn't also heinous and disgusting, but it also occupies that special place in our hearts that means when someone's accused of it our rational, conscious brains shut off and the emotional, knee-jerk lizard brain-stem takes over that says nothing but ""**BURN HIM**"".

A comparison is useful here - I think we can all agree that instances of murder or terrorism usually have far worse *effects* than child abuse - they actually lead to deaths and bereavement for entire families and social groups, for starters.  conversely, while child abuse is a heinous crime it's also one that victims can and do often recover from and go on to lead happy, fulfilled lives.  (Should anyone be tempted to argue this point, incidentally, consider why we don't simply euthanise abused children if death is really preferable to a life after child abuse.)

However *unlike* murder or terrorism the mere spectre of child sexual abuse has the ability to make most people turn off their rational, intellectual mind and start acting from the brain-stem, rapidly devolving into a mindless baying mob.

Immediately considerations like ""innocent until proven guilty"" go out the window, accusation is treated as proof, and people start handing out torches and pitchforks before formal charges are even laid.  Even if the accused is acquitted they're often tainted for life merely by the suspicion.

It's a nuanced point I'm making here - I'm not arguing that paedophilia is good, or acceptable, or anything other than utterly heinous and disgusting.  I am arguing, however, that it's a *profound social taboo* that has the ability to *turn off most people's rational thought processes* in the way that even murder or similar heinous crimes can't... and that as such, we should be careful to inspect our automatic responses to ensure they are fair, just, proportionate and all those other noble qualities that we recognise are desirable.

The tabloid press aside, even when someone's accused of murder people are generally capable of reasoning calmly and proportionately about it, and if they're conclusively proven innocent then they can usually shed the stigma over time.

As soon as someone's accused of paedophilia we almost *want* to believe it - we rush to judgement, we make knee-jerk emotive assessments of guilt without knowing even the first thing about the circumstances, and even if the accused is found innocent we keep them away from children and say things like ""no smoke without fire"".

Historically people used to act this way about things like accusations of witchcraft or Satanism (or communism in the USA) - each at a different time such a great taboo that it could make even normal, reasonable people lose their minds and advocate lynching or imprisoning their neighbours on mere suspicion.

I know people feel this way - I feel it myself when someone brings up the subject.  the only difference is that I know and recognise that this urge to race headlong to judgement is motivated by a subconscious, socially-inculcated taboo that's been programmed into me, rather than a cool-headed, calm rationale that people can easily consider and discuss dispassionately... and believing that emotional flailing is an improper basis from which to make decisions I make a *sustained and conscious effort* to rein in that emotive lizard brain-stem and try to consider the issue the way I would any other.

Child abuse is heinous and disgusting and evil, and I'm thoroughly glad we're rooting it out of society, but that doesn't mean it isn't *also* the subject of a powerful and profound emotional taboo, or that whatever emotional assumptions and non-rational attitudes and actions people intuitively and non-rationally jump to in response to that emotional upset are necessarily the most productive and optimal course of action.",0,1404146330,null,0,1404150194,0,cikxadd,t3_29h0o2,t1_cikxadd,t1_cikwi6w,null,1434480148,43,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,43

In fact, the same report shows [improvement from their 2004 reports onwards](http://i.imgur.com/0hKqd5R.jpg) 

Although if the 2014 report is referencing 2007 data for their ""healthy lives"" findings I would question the accuracy of it now as we've been more focussed on lifestyle changes and better monitoring for a while. 

The report also states: 

&gt;""Any attempt to assess the relative performance of countries has inherent limitations. These rankings summarize evidence on measures of high performance based on national mortality data and the perceptions and experiences of patients and physicians.

You could just as easily say that it is a result of ""matriarchy"" that men are seen as disposable cannon fodder whereas women are worthy of protection.

This is perhaps the most sickening things feminists do. They turn any problems men have back into their own narrative, so they can ignore them, or indeed claim that they are trying to help them (while ignoring them). When feminist organisations oppose more funding for male domestic violence services, or oppose joint custody legislation that would give fathers equal treatment in family court.. they then have the gall to say ""oh, but all the problems men face are a result of patriarchy, which we are trying to smash! just leave it to us guys!"".

They say they're trying to help yet their organisations oppose any legislation that would benefit men, at every chance they get.

They also bang on about male privilege. Well, even if we grant that men being treated as disposable cannon fodder is a result of patriarchy, wouldn't the fact that women are seen as worthy of protection, in cases of disaster ""women and children first"" etc, would that not be an example of female privilege.....?

But whatever, carry on pretending its all the patriarchy.

I can hardly say I'm an expert on the classics, but I've certainly seen a fair bit of 4 and he is undeniably fantastic. He's charming and dangerous and totally deserves the respect he has of being The doctor of doctors.

Who doesn't get enough credit or screen time is Paul McGann. The doctor who movie is riddled with issues of course, but it's such a product of the 90s. Being as I did most of my growing up in that decade, the movie with all of it's camp, and flaws, and scenes which make absolutely no sense is actually quite charming. It reminds me of the old ninja turtles movies. That being said, the real treat is McGann. He's fantastic! It's a real shame he didn't get more time with the role, even his brief bit in night of the doctor is great.

At some point it's semantics, we'll certainly play with players advanced in wide positions, but when it's appropriate to call that player a ""winger"" instead of a wide forward isn't at all clear to me. If we're talking about quick guys who get to the byline and cross and not much else, sure we have two guys who do that, but in the modern game, that's far less valuable than a player who can do that (perhaps not quite as well) and also cut inside, play through balls, win a header, etc.

For me, it's about getting your best eleven guys on the pitch, and then suiting your tactics to best harness the talents you've deployed.

The SFI (Special Faults Investigation) aka Broadband engineers will have to prove the port is faulty, this is normally changed by ISPs as a last resort (since it means the port in theory can never be used again until it is 'fixed')

If the DS/Us rates are similar to each other then you have some kind of connection problem.

Log into the router, get the Line Attenuation reading from it, dependent on the Attn you will get your sync rate. (if you tell me what it is I can confirm what sync rates your 'should' get.

The reason I'm anti-feminist is because I've actually tried to affect change in our legislation, and in every case it is the feminist organisations that oppose us. When we try to get more funding for male victims of domestic violence, we are opposed by feminist groups. Never mind the fact that men make up 40% of DV victims yet receive 1% of the funding. 

I mean, does this even matter to you? Do you actually care that it is the feminist organisations that oppose the changes in legislation that would bring about some equity? That's why I say this whole ""patriarchy"" business is just a way of dismissing something you don't really care about.

I hope that isn't the case, but I have to say it seems that way when talking to feminists. ""Oh men, all your problems are a result of patriarchy, now leave us to it, and support US!"" 

Also, even if I grant that women being seen as worthy of protection is a result of ""patriarchy"", that still doesn't change the fact that it is a female privilege, does it?

After all, feminists often say ""patriarchy hurts men too"", but simultaneously talk about male privilege. So it seems as if being hurt by patriarchy doesn't therefore mean you don't have privileges. In what way is not having to fight in wars not a privilege? Oh, because of ""patriarchy"", yeah.

&gt;I'm not arguing that it may well not have been perjury for other reasons, but on that specific point, you are simply wrong. The fact that it didn't affect the outcome is irrelevant.  

No it isn't. If you want to be an arse about it, on this point, you are ""simply wrong"". The fact that the statement didn't directly affect the outcome is relevant because it is one of only two closely related ways in which the statement can be material. The other closely related way - which I wasn't aware of when I wrote that first comment - is if it was relied on in such a way that the outcome of the procedure might have been something other than what it was.

Both of these require the statement to have had a particular relationship to the range of possible outcomes and the actual outcome of the procedure. Neither of them appears to be true of Rebekah Brooks's statement.

&gt;Under what circumstance would ""I'm guilty of the crime I'm accused of"" be treated as irrelevant or insignificant?  

I can think of one or two fairly unlikely situations, but shall we try to apply it to the matter under discussion rather than the one that you've just made up? Let's suppose that her statement was false, the reality being that they had never paid police for information. The statement cannot be material unless a member or members of the select committee relied on it in such a way that it might have affected the outcome. If they didn't rely on it at all, then clearly it cannot be material and is not perjury.  

Hopefully we're both now clear on what the law actually is, at least.

Now your course might not be as 'industry friendly' as mine or your department may not be as keen on placements as mine was but there are still opportunities out there, both in the UK and abroad (if you fancy a little adventure). 

I'd say the best time to start thinking properly about this is summer of year one. Talk to your tutor, talk to your careers service.

Make sure your ready for when the september (year 2) application window opens. I know all the civil service tracks (plus big 4 accountancy) closed way before Christmas the year I did it.

Given that you've probably worked for a year or two (a big plus over a good number of your peers), try your damnedest get yourself a reasonable set of grades in the first year and then follow your departments advice. Depending on your target profession, you might also want to try for a soc management post at the start of your second year. YMMV.

Firstly, nothing to do with Barca, there is a rather large question there as to whether they will be willing to meet the £80m clause. If they don't, I doubt he's sold. I also, apologies to the dreamers' do not think Sanchez will agree to move to LFC as part of a swap deal. LFC will wait at least until Suarez is back on merseyside and take it from there. It's just sensationalist stuff at the moment, Suarez is hot news, so stories about him increase. Textbook.

Secondly, nothing to do with the appeal either as the language has been carefully chosen to retain an element of deniability of the actual charge. Expect appeal against the punishment will still be forthcoming.

Lastly, of course it sounds forced, he is the fulcrum of a huge PR machine.

I made clear I obviously don't believe that false accusers shouldn't be prosecuted. 

&gt;  there would need to be prima facia evidence of a false allegation

I don't have the legal knowledge to respond to this, and I don't claim to - I was merely making the point that its a complex issue that isn't clear cut as 'omg everyone who doesn't want to immediately introduce the death sentence for false accusation is a nazi-feminist!!11!!' (hyperbole obviously...). 

&gt; Thirdly the idea that any case that doesn't result in a conviction will leave the accuser on the hook for a false allegation prosecution is wrong

In no way can you make that claim. Rape is still notoriously under-reported in no small part to mistrust between victims and police/legal system: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25964991. Obviously I equally can't, and don't, concretely say 'if you increase severity of punishment for false accusations, it will affect the number of victims that do come forward'. But that's my point, it's a complex issue that needs serious evidence-based consideration and investigation and you are doing it a disservice by treating it as a simple one.

False accusers should be suitably punished. We should ensure that victims are supported and not dissuaded from pressing charges.

You seem to think that feminism wants to get rid of the male gender role, when in reality it doesn't. It likes the male gender role.

That's why MRAs are shamed as being ""neckbeards"", ""virgins"", who ""can't get laid"". If you yourself are a feminist and are involved in feminist circles then you will know that it is extremely common to talk of MRAs in this way. I've been called a ""little boy"" myself, which is a form of shaming, as if to suggest that I am not a ""real man"". You can dismiss this as just the worst of the Tumblr lot if you like, but if you're honest I think you'd have to admit it is actually very common. I see this sort of thing on 2X all the time.

If the problem is the fact that the male gender role is limiting, and that is a result of ""patriarchy"", then I honestly can not think of a group that does more to shame men into conforming to their role than feminists.

This passage needs a reply all of its own. What are you basing this on? You do realise these punishment attacks where not random events. I've taken this quote from the article (published in JAN 1999) you linked to above.

&gt; But there is a basis for the republican claim that punishment beatings enjoy some local support. A total of 9,500 stolen cars were recovered in west Belfast last year. Misery caused by “joy-riding” may breed support for paramilitary punishments.

There is no distinction in the law on evidence between forensic evidence (in the sense you mean: expert evidence) and witness evidence. The question of weight and relevance after it is admitted is a matter for the jury. That is all I meant. 

I don't think juries are as simple as you seem to think they are.
 
I don't think expert evidence has the effect you think it does. 

Experts are sometimes brilliant and sometimes poor, as are lay witnesses. The experts to 'prove' the indecent images charges would, in fact, be police computer technicians. They can only say the information was on, say, a hard drive and cannot confirm that a specific person accessed it. They are rarely brilliant in court, the subject matter is fairly dry. 

You don't necessarily need an expert to cross-examine an expert. You tend to need experience and common-sense.

In any event- the information would not go in. Read the case of Hanson. It's a single conviction (I think). Just to follow one of the lines of reasoning in Hanson, a single conviction cannot establish a propensity unless there is a striking similarity between that conviction and the offence which is being tried. There are many more. 

You say any prosecution worth its salt. The prosecution has a duty to make a bad character application where it is appropriate, considering it's own guidelines (published on the CPS website). The guidelines are based on case-law. Any prosecutor worth his salt would carefully consider the facts of the present case, the facts of the previous conviction and likely (I hesitate from saying definitely- depend on the facts) conclude that it is not appropriate to make an application.

Take a typical journey - commuting between Peterborough and London. A weekly ticket will cost £149.50 (or 177.50 if you want a bit more flexibility). I think that's a pretty fair price for ten journeys (five days, two directions) of 80-ish miles. It's about 18p per mile.

An atypical journey now - Hastings to Barmouth. An off-peak return is £96.80 for 640-ish miles (15p per mile), and that's if you're too stupid to book in advance.

Now let's look at the most recent journey I did in Germany. Munich to Munchberg is €72/£57 for 270-ish km/167 miles, again assuming no discounts. Or 34p per mile. So tell me, which is the expensive country?

However, you made the initial point about the prosecution 'fighting tooth and nail' to have the convictions in. Well, they have to have that fight in front of the judge- who will regard forensic evidence equal to the evidence of witnesses, which is the law. Therefore, your point about some evidence being 'better' than other evidence has no bearing on whether it will go before the jury or not. I should probably also say: do you actually expect that if (in the extremely unlikely) circumstances the bad character evidence is adduced the prosecution will turn to the jury with a flourish and say ""this, members of the jury is a conviction founded on forensic evidence!"". Don't you think that would undermine the prosecution brought on the basis of lay witnesses' evidence?

I think your approach to juries is wrong. I suspect you don't have any real experience of jury advocacy. I suspect you don't have any real grounding in criminal law because you don't know the case of Hanson. 

I would not make the application on the basis of what I know. Prosecution should be fair.

You're not trying to get the precons in to sway the judge.

&gt;Therefore, your point about some evidence being 'better' than other evidence has no bearing on whether it will go before the jury or not.

No, its all about the impact it has on the case and how the jury view it, not if they get to see it at all.

&gt;the prosecution will turn to the jury with a flourish and say ""this, members of the jury is a conviction founded on forensic evidence!"". Don't you think that would undermine the prosecution brought on the basis of lay witnesses' evidence?

No, that would be a terrible way to present your evidence, yes it would serve to undermine your witness based case if you presented it in that manor. Your line of questioning is very leading...

Best case scenario in my mind would be if there was no plea and the charges were heard together, so the jury are given the science on the way through the totality of the evidence.

&gt;I would not make the application on the basis of what I know. Prosecution should be fair. 

Seems fair to me that previous convictions are brought up where relevant, rather than being wrapped up in red tape for the fear of giving the jury the whole truth.

&gt;I suspect you don't have any real experience of jury advocacy.

Never claimed any. Wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole.

What they did would be akin to Labour entering a coalition and reducing the minimum wage or privatising parts of the NHS as far as I'm concerned.

I don't think I'll ever be able to see it as more than a short-term power grab that perfectly encapsulates why politicians are generally not trusted, and why there are so many youths not interested in politics. Clegg can go about trying to justify it or try to win back support by backing the legalisation of cannabis but considering it is completely unrealistic to expect the Lib Dems to be anything more than a minority coalition partner, he'll never get my support because I'll never trust what policies he is unwilling to sacrifice.

As I said though, I recognise that my focus on tuition fees might just be indicative of my own outlook on politics.

He supported the abolition of tuition fees for a reason so to try to justify such a large increase is just in bad taste.

If you pay through PAYE and earn over £153/week, you pay NI contributions of 12% (up to £805/wk) and your employer also pays 13.8% which does not come off your wages. ",0,1404155197,null,0,false,0,cil1qir,t3_29gk0m,t1_cil1qir,t1_cil15y2,null,1434483369,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Really we should only look to bring in some competition for Rose on the left and call it a day.

It's not prudent business to buy a young player who just had a superb world cup. If you're looking for a winger then Konoplyanka is a better deal. He'll probably cost half the money and we won't have to go in on a bidding war to get him. 

I really don't think we need a LW, though, as Chadli should have that spot sewn up next season. Ade with Chadli-Eriksen-Lamela behind him, Bentaleb - Capoue after them is the idea midfield IMO. Throwing Depay or Konoplyanka won't be a huge improvement over Chadli. Chadli firing on all cylinders is a great thing to watch - Chadli isolated on the left because no one is paying enough attention to go out and meet him (as we saw last season) isn't. 

It all comes down to what Pochettino wants - I could see him preferring someone like Depay or Konoplyanka, but I think we'll stick with Chadli.

There's plenty to stop them. For a start, it's very difficult to get a landlord who wants to rent to someone on a low income. My cousin had over 20 estate agents fail to find her somewhere that would accept her because people with more respectable jobs look better on an application. Secondly, if you are finding it hard to pay £800p/m rent, you would probably also find it hard to scrape together a £1000+ deposit and agency/landlord/referencing fees as well as costs associated with moving.

Some staff will allow you to present a driving licence with an address printed on it as ID and evidence of your address, opening a fee-free basic account for you with a Visa Electron card, but keeping it at the branch until you can prove you have a UK address at which point they'll change the address to the UK one.

Basically - when you enter the UK - read up a little on the bank you're intending to open up at - and be prepared to ask for the fee-free account. I got lucky by walking into HSBC in Covent Garden, London, with nothing but my passport and overseas drivers licence.

Birth rates that allow for maintaining a stable population enable manageable levels of infrastructure including schools, hospitals, jails, etc. Were the birth rate to be half of the necessary replenishment level you would need to attract massive levels of immigration.

Immigrants, unlike the indigenous population, tend not to be spread out evenly enabling the cost-effective maintenance of nation-wide infrastructure. Instead they tend to congregate at urban centres and where jobs are, meaning that new infrastructure is required and existing infrastructure no longer proves cost effective to maintain. 

This has a massive cost which means that either taxes need to rise to pay for it (making everyone poorer) or people have to go without/have longer wait times (reducing everyone's quality of life). On top of this large-scale immigration has the potential to cause/exacerbate inter-community tensions, particularly when coupled with a reduction in quality of life.

true,prof_hobart,null,null,"&gt;The fact that the statement didn't directly affect the outcome is relevant because it is one of only two closely related ways in which the statement can be material.

No it's not relevant. You weren't simply claiming that you could be done for perjury if it affected the outcome of the trial - your claim was specifically that it could be perjury if, **and only if**, it affected the outcome of a trial, and therefore it could not be perjury. That statement is simply not true. You've now agreed that it's not true, yet you still also seem to be claiming that it's sort of true. 

Let me give you an analogy. If you asked ""is that red fruit there an apple?"", and I replied with ""No. An apple can only be green"", I would be wrong. The fact that an apple *can* be green is irrelevant.

&gt;The statement cannot be material unless a member or members of the select committee relied on it in such a way that it might have affected the outcome. If they didn't rely on it at all, then clearly it cannot be material and is not perjury.

OK, but you're not explaining *why* the committee would possibly choose to completely disregard her statement and consider it completely unimportant. They may well not let it decide their final decision, but that - as I keep pointing out - is a different matter. And even if they chose to ignore it, that doesn't change whether it's perjury. 

As you yourself stated it is ""whether a statement might have affected the outcome of the proceedings, not that it would have done"". What matters is whether they *might* have taken notice of it, not whether they *did*. What you would need to show to demonstrate that it wouldn't be perjury is that there is no realistic chance that it would have affected proceedings.

Let me give you another example - if I'm a witness for the defence and I falsely claim the accused couldn't have committed the crime because they were in Spain with me at the time, that would probably be perjury - regardless of whether anyone in the court actually believed me - because it was a lie that could possibly have fooled people.

For a long time people were oblivious to domestic violence, now they're talking about it more and discovering that men are victims too. 

Some examples of the first 4 sites that showed up from one google search:

[#1](http://www.helpguide.org/mental/domestic-violence-men-abused-by-women.htm)

[#2](http://www.mensadviceline.org.uk/mens_advice.php.html)

[#3](http://heart-2-heart.ca/men/)

[#4](http://www.mankind.org.uk/)

I know there is more help for women but that's purely because women get abused in relationships more than men, but there is still lots of support for male victims. There is stigma (being weak, needing to man up) which is held by some but not from everyone. I know two guys who've been in abusive/controlling relationships and I've believed them, supported and sympathised with them with no questions. I didn't believe they were weak because I know how the mind games go and how much control they can have. I also know another guy who was raped when he was younger, I didn't view him as weak either. In fact, it opened my eyes to the level of abuse that happens against men that goes on behind closed doors.

As I stated, at that time there were valid reason for that community to hate the police. The police were not welcome in those areas. If they got out of their meat wagons they were regularly attacked by the IRA, supporters and residents. 

How could they uphold the law if they were constantly attacked when investigating or responding to crimes? 

&gt;Would you care to qualify this statement? Have you got figures handy or did you assemble this random ""fact"" in your imagination?
&gt;DAAD operated for around five years targeting and assassinating high profile drug dealers, they did not target random drug users that is simply absurd, as well as an impossible task. Joyriding is a separate anti social problem.

""DAAD""  did not exist in isolation. **It was part of a punish drugs movement**. People were getting beaten by the ""IRA"" for ""drug taking"" FACT. I know of a few people, one who I worked with who got beat for specifically that. They called at his door and told his mum exactly that. Before taking him outside and beating him. People were also beat because of guilt by association and stupid disagreements. 

Call people ""hoods"" for taking drugs, punishing them for it, make them outcasts in their own community......tell them not to take drugs or steal cars.....they are going to take drugs and steal cars for spite.

DAAD existed the same time when ""hoods"" were at their greatest. Coincidence? 

Punishment beatings for ""drug taking"" were also rife at that time. Coincidence?

When the retardation of the punishments stopped, the ""hoods"" became less ""hoody"". They didn't need to be ""hoods"", they could go out and take an E or smoke weed without being as much of an antisocial outcast for doing it. 

I maintain the stance, the IRA and the policing situation created hood culture. 

**The war on ""drugs"" made the whole thing 1000000 times worse.**   

*(""drugs"" should be legalised and regulated like the drug alcohol is)*

The action taken by republicans &amp; loyalists against **drug takers** and dealers makes for some very shocking reading. It is often described in detail and the victims and many protagonists are named. The paramilitaries, act as judge, jury and mete out the punishments or executions often with some public support.

I agree; Suarez needs to leave. He was exceptional last season, no doubt about that. But I honestly can't see him repeating it. If he were to get 31 goals this season, it'd be a miracle. So if we add in decent options, like Lallana and Sanchez, who can give us extra goals from other parts of the field, I think we'll have more that compensated for the sale of his lunacy to elsewhere.

That said, as I've mentioned elsewhere, I'd be in favor of Liverpool keeping him, making him sit out for 6 months or however long it takes to get his psychology on the right track (and to prove that's the case).

If it becomes *easy*(or is perceived as easy as per the deterrent) to prosecute people for false allegations of rape then serial abusers will use the *no one will believe you* line followed by *...and I'll have you done for false accusations* giving serial abusers extra leverage over their victims making it easier to continue the cycle of abuse. Also it could conceivably create a situation where people would have to be double innocent of rape i.e the accuser must be charged with false allegations, which would be a bad road to go down.

Ultimately rape already has very low prosecution rates and as terrible as they are I'd imagine malicious false accusations are quite uncommon as a percentage of reported rapes. It would be good to have a mechanism for blatant false accusations such as this but there would remain the question as to whether it would actually have a negative effect on rape victims themselves. Ultimately it is better to be the victim of false accusations of rape than to be a victim of rape, so maybe moving in a direction that favours the accused is not best overall.

true,Ghoul12,null,null,"When I see feminist organisations actively opposing legislation that would benefit men, and then I also see next to no feminists actually come out against it, in fact many of them supporting it, then I can consider that to mean that most of them at the very best, just don't care, and at the worst, actually want to disadvantage men.

I'm sorry but I hear it all the time from feminists that ""that's only the minority"". So where are all the feminists who speak out against it? Where are they? If they're the majority, then where are they?

Any feminists that do speak out against it and say ""hold up a second this stuff hurts men"", are viciously sidelined and ruthlessly thrown out of the ""sisterhood"". 

Christina Hoff Summers and Warren Farrell are examples of this. These are people that were once feminists, powerful ones that did their very best to help the women's movement. The moment they voiced their concerns that aspects of feminism and feminist-backed legislation were hurting men? They were thrown out of the movement.

Every time they try to hold a talk they are protested and verbally abused, often with fire alarms being pulled.

Now where are the feminists who speak out against this? I don't think you understand, MRA groups are not anti-feminist just for kicks. They are anti-feminist because in most cases, it is actually feminist organisations that support the legislation that hurts men.

The Duluth model of domestic violence is a good example. This was a feminist backed legislation that states that in a case of domestic violence it is the physically larger person who should be arrested. This results in men being arrested in almost every case, despite in many cases, having personally called the police themselves as a victim of abuse. Now feminists say ""the reason men are arrested is because patriarchy says women are innocent!"".

Yet in reality, the reason men are arrested even if they call the police themselves is because of the Duluth model, which was supported by practically every single feminist organisation. 

I'm sorry but your idea that modern feminism wants to help men is simply absurd. They may say they do, but the legislation they support overwhelmingly harms men.

b) **it's not part of football/it's taboo etc.** - a bite is considered violent conduct. There are specific mentions of other things that are considered taboo (like spitting or attacking the referee) and allow for longer punishments. Biting isn't one of them.

c) **it's at the World Cup and the world is watching** - leaving aside the absurdity of this argument (Sunday League football would be mayhem if bans were based on how many people are watching) there's no reference to it at all in the FIFA regulations.

It's not the most attractive place in the world and has all the amenities you'd expect for a town of it's size (i.e. not very much). Don't know about nightlife, but as for the beer you could try and find somewhere that's to your liking on [tripadvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurants-g186443-Holyhead_Island_of_Anglesey_North_Wales_Wales.html), or just be on the look out for a decent looking pub. 

I'd recommend hopping on the train to Bangor. It's not a hell of a lot bigger than Holyhead, but it is much livelier. It's a university town, so there are plenty of pubs and the occasional nightclub that cater for the students. It's also something of a regional center, so the town centre isn't dead like Holyhead's. Plenty to see as well - the cathedral in the town centre, the university on its hill, Bangor Pier out on the Menai Strait (which has an excellent cafe famous for its scones), Penrhyn Castle and its grounds (a National Trust property so be prepared to pay), and Thomas Telford's beautiful suspension bridge over the Menai. 

If you don't fancy that, you could always explore Holyhead Mountain (weather permitting of course). It's just to the west of town, offering some easy walks that come with great views back over the town, with Anglesey and Snowdonia as a backdrop. You could aim for [South Stack](http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g186443-d1140582-Reviews-South_Stack_Lighthouse-Holyhead_Island_of_Anglesey_North_Wales_Wales.html) as an end point.

true,kddean66,num18,,"With this post I was trying to convey the idea that our strikers were poor because our midfield play was poor. They kept possession as long as they could pass sideways and to the back 4 but rarely did we have quality moving forward in the middle or on the wings - at least not at a top 4 level. Also, with the exception of Siggy and Paulinho (whose other failings I detailed in the op) we didn't really have midfielders crashing the box with regularity. If we want to claim that it is because they were all settling in, then we also have to cut Soldado slack.

As I said in my op, I would look to move out 5 or so midfielders and bring in 2-3 quality mids/wingers with the proceeds. That's not a wholesale squad change as some have suggested, especially since we played so many different midfield combinations last year anyway. It's not like I'm suggesting that we break up a solidified midfield - far from it. I would rather have 2 - 3 players of quality than 5 of lesser quality.

Again, if I were King, I start the season playing Sandro, Eriksen, Paulinho, Lamela and perhaps a new lw and see how it plays out from there. Four of the five are currently in the squad.

P.S. Obviously, LB is a crucial requirement - no dispute. I'm merely pointing out that striker seems to be getting the press when imo, midfield was more troubling.

If you do a Google Scholar search rather than a normal Google one you'll find quite a few articles detailing how the riots happened along the borders between rich and poor areas, where people were most marginalised and felt most 'out of the loop' as to how a neoliberal city works. 'The disaffected youth' or words to that effect come up a lot. This probably shows in the fact that such a large part of the riots ended up just being looting.

This article in particular says the riots were a lot to do with consumerism, and you could argue neoliberal policy and changes in urban governance in the Thatcher years helped create more consumerism. This sentence in the introduction is very interesting:
&gt;Thus, the riots can be read as a macabre demonstration of the contemporary vigour of the ideal of the consumer, largely unencumbered by the regulations of an overbearing state or the restraining norms of a robust civil society.http://www.socresonline.org.uk/16/4/19.html",0,1404167967,null,0,false,0,cil838k,t3_29hxfq,t1_cil838k,t3_29hxfq,null,1434487923,7,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,7

The story proved too tabloid-esque for the Eye - true.

And it's also true that it was awkward for me (I took the interview). 

Let's see about the 'teasers' you mention.

1. attempts to discredit the reporter: ""So we sort of assume that you’re not part of an oil company."" that's just one instance. 

2. a complete denial that Lush took dirty oil money although it did: ""He’s built Lush himself with his money and he has not taken money from Wolverton Securities. His older brother runs Wolverton Securities. So when the dad dies, he owned property in Vancouver, so all of [them] Mark and his family owned property."" - ie property bought with oil and mining cash; Lush wasn't given away to Mr Wolverton, it was sold (""a few quid"") 

3. an admission of his own hypocrisy: ""we’re all hypocrites, you know, I run a vegetarian company and I eat fish. They all tease me I’m a fish and chipocryte. Everyone’s the same, it’s all the same.""

4. a candid admission that his top CEO isn’t ‘a big environmentalist’: ""When Mark Wolverton came into the business, he said quite clearly, ‘I’m not signing up for all this environmental stuff, I’m not that strongly environmental. ""

5. a dig at the reporter personally: ""What does your brother do?/ I haven’t got a brother, sir./  A sister?/  No.""

6. an attempted bribery in the form of a veiled job offer to the reporter, swiftly withdrawn after refusal: ""It’d be much more fun to do something dramatic and dynamic about the situation in there that we can support than to attack us."" - he's talking about a Lush campaign here, which he invites me to join. Support means money, I believe.

So they would be the staple of my starting XI. Martin the core. In terms of departures, I feel Hooper will go to a premier league club and Becchio will leave as the club has been shite to him. I also worry for Hoolahan after he was left on the bench. He could maybe join Lambert. I do worry that Olsson may also be snapped up as he's a quality young LB and those are all the range at the moment.  

With all that in mind, I'd like the squad to look a bit like this...


GK: Ruddy, ? .  

DEFENCE: Martin, Bennet, Turner, Olsson (hopefully), Garrido, Whittaker + 2 CBS.  

MIDFIELD: Bennett, Pilkington (could go), Redmond, Murphy Brothers, Howson, Fer (hopefully), Johnson, Tettey + Replacements for maybe Tettey and Fer.  

FORWARDS: RVW, Grabban, Lafferty, Loza + 1 More.  

I think that the Josh Murphy and *maybe* Loza are the only youth players ready to step up. Jacob Murphy too but not McGeehan as we have too many CMs. Toffolo needs more experience as the championship is tough.
