But it isn't unreasonable to compare to alcohol - which is cheap to make yourself and expensive to buy... and yet people don't bother to make it themselves in the main. Because it takes time and effort and its much more convenient to buy it instead. Cannabis will be no different.

Only addresses some of the more cynical reasons that alcohol and tobacco are legalised. 

All I've been addressing since then is the difficulties of *taxing* cannabis given that it *can* be grown at home *and* assuming it's legalised everywhere - there's no way of keeping track of what is store bought and what is home grown. 

Alcohol on the other hand is bulkier and more obviously either store bought or home grown - and only drinkable in certain environments.

false,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; Neither is there of tobacco

Is it possible to home grow viable quantities of tobacco? I didn't realise... 

&gt; The smell is overwhelming and the environment it can be grown in must be very bright and very humid which consumes a lot of power, and its almost impossible to smoke a joint discretely anywhere public making it only consumable ""in certain environments"" much the same as alcohol or tobacco.

The smell is irrelevant - if it's legal to smoke it, you'll know what it is. You *won't* know whether it was grown in someone's home or via industrial scale production. Again if it's legal you won't need to be discreet *and* you can carry it anywhere in small quantities much more easily than a can of beer or bottle of wine. 

You're right about the production methods - but out on the high street, who will know? Are we to keep home production illegal then? That will require the same police resources to follow up on as we already have. Depending on the need and tenacity of some people, they might try it anyway. 

&gt; What environments cant you drink alcohol in when its disguised as, lets say a bottle of water or perhaps wrapped in a brown paper bag?

Fair point - can't say I see this happen on a frequent basis though and it's still more effort than the zero effort required to disguise your home grown weed from indistinguishable store bought weed. 

&gt; Also whats stopping a person from just putting their home made alcohol in an empty store bought alcohol container like a vodka bottle if spirits or a beer bottle if beer.

Depending on where you're drinking - and society is already at a stage where people *tend* not to drink on the street - you'll be hard pressed to get any bottle or container into a restaurant openly - or pub, bar etc.

To you these things may seem ""pointless"" or ""needless"", but similarly there are those poorer than you that may think the same about you having a nice PC or games console etc.

As an example, I know some guy who is building a basement to his mansion that's 3 stories **underground** with swimmingpool, bowling alley and cinema room (not just a projector a chairs I can tell you that!).

Chances are he'll actually use the swimming pool quite a bit as he want it for exercise (it's next to his gym), and maybe he enjoys a good film, but I don't know the reasoning behind the bowling alley (maybe he plays it a lot, I don't know).

To be fair, I don't think he has yet to invest in foreign holiday homes yet (I think he just likes renting the larger villas etc). But that's another example of something he *could* spend his money on.

At some point, it's no longer necessary to accumulate more money. But then you want to make sure it's secure for your children! That's a 40% inheritance tax, and you may have multiple children! Surely you could try to provide fully for them like you have yourself. So that requires at least doubling your wealth.

I'm not saying it's justified to have the wealth split like it is. I'm just trying to show that until you get mega rich (like, I own a fleet of yachts rich) there's still stuff you could potentially spend your money on.

With any other relationships (e.g. two 13-years olds) they could still be free to use their discretion.

There are a number of forums specifically dedicated to giving the general public tips and tricks on which are the best strains to use and how to do it.

&gt; The smell is irrelevant

The smell is absolutely relevant when we are talking about growing it at home or consuming it in ""certain environments"" as you said before.

&gt; Are we to keep home production illegal then? That will require the same police resources to follow up on as we already have.

Bullshit, where is your evidence for this? Home growing viable amounts of weed requires either a lot of time or a lot of expensive equipment (that consume a lot of energy) and space. It would be much easier to simply purchase it (using current street prices).

&gt; Depending on the need and tenacity of some people, they might try it anyway.

There will always be people who do things illegally whatever the law states, people grow tobacco and brew beer already and its illegal too whilst you claim its still easier to buy it legally. But people still continue to homebrew/grow tobacco.

&gt; can't say I see this happen on a frequent basis though and it's still more effort than the zero effort required to disguise your home grown weed from indistinguishable store bought weed.

I would say the efforts are pretty equal, pouring your brewed beer into empty bottles isnt exactly difficult, and neither is taking weed buds from homegrown plants and placing it in bags. Whats difficult is actually growing/brewing the stuff and the expensive equipment required to do so if you want a viable source.

&gt; Depending on where you're drinking - and society is already at a stage where people tend not to drink on the street - you'll be hard pressed to get any bottle or container into a restaurant openly - or pub, bar etc.

Cant really argue this point, there is no consensus on where its ok to take a joint, as its currently illegal.

&gt; The simplicities involved are not proportionate, much though it would be great if they were.

The simplicities involved most certainly are proportionate. beer is just a liquid, you can pour it into any container and no one would question you. Why do you think its so hard to disguise beer? its really not.",0,1413377161,null,0,1413377528,0,cla2b6f,t3_2jaqh7,t1_cla2b6f,t1_cla22i3,null,1426518108,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

And it makes sense when you think about it:  If you have 100 identical people and you give them all the same opportunity, some of them will not take it, some of them will, so you get inequality of outcome from equality of opportunity *entirely naturally*.

Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of inequality of opportunity floating about in the UK and I'd like to see less.  But having a tiny bump in wealth inequality is neither significant nor evidence of a fall in equality of opportunity.

Do you need some form of cover in case someone who is letting injures themselves on your premises? Will you be liable? What  happens if their possessions go missing? Or somebody dies? There is the potential for serious amounts of compensation being sought if so.

AirBnB may have their own guidance on this, but I suppose you'll effectively be running a guesthouse/bed and breakfast, and may need similar insurances.

[HMRC's guidance on letting](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/cgt/property/sell-own-home.htm#4) all or part of your home states:

&gt; Letting all or part of your home
&gt; 
&gt; If you've let out all or part of your home you may not get full Private Residence Relief when you sell or dispose of it. But you may get another relief known as 'Letting Relief'.
&gt; 
&gt; The maximum amount of Letting Relief due is the lower of:
&gt; 
&gt;     £40,000
&gt;     the amount of Private Residence Relief due
&gt;     the amount of gain you've made on the let part of the property
&gt; 
&gt; Example
&gt; 
&gt; You used 60% of your house as your home and let out the other 40%.
&gt; 
&gt; You sell the property, making a gain of £60,000.
&gt; 
&gt; You're entitled to Private Residence Relief of £36,000 on the part used as your home (60% of the £60,000 gain).
&gt; 
&gt; The remaining gain on the part of your home that's been let is £24,000.
&gt; 
&gt; The maximum Letting Relief due is £24,000 as this is the lower of:
&gt; 
&gt;     £40,000
&gt;     £36,000 (the Private Residence Relief due)
&gt;     £24,000 (the gain on the part of the property that's been let)
&gt; 
&gt; There's no Capital Gains Tax to pay - the gain of £60,000 is covered by the £36,000 Private Residence Relief and the £24,000 Letting Relief.

To be fair though, HMRC seem to imply that rent-a-room relief may apple [here](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/pimmanual/pim4001.htm)

&gt; What income does it apply to?
&gt; 
&gt; The scheme applies to income from providing furnished accommodation (or from providing goods and services in connection with that accommodation) in the individual's only or main residence. This obviously covers income from lodgers. It may also be applied to bed and breakfast or guest house businesses (assessable as trading income) provided that:
&gt; 
&gt;     the house in which the business is carried on is also the individual's only or main residence,
&gt;     the normal rent-a-room conditions are met.
&gt; 
&gt; Rent-a-room applies to income otherwise assessable as trading income and/or property income.
&gt; 
&gt;It is available whether the residence is owned or rented.

Given that the room will (I guess) be furnished and not self-contained I can't remember ever seeing reference to it only applying to a single lodger.

RAR relief is handy; you can either choose to pay tax only on the excess of £4,250 PA income, or on the income less any expenses associated with lodgings, whichever is more tax efficient. This election can be made each year.

edit:

In general, you may find you have a better time with a traditional lodging arrangement; nobody will be taking a cut and you will have more consistent income. If you live near a university you may find that hosting a post-graduate PHD student or similar would work well.

If you think about this prison thing, if they ever were to get into a position where they could action it, I'm sure it would be refined and even if it was still exclusive to women, it wouldn't be too difficult for a case to be made that it goes against Article 14 of HRA (prohibition of discrimination) and groups like Fathers for Justice could take it to court to be challenged.  But no policy is ever set in stone and once a public discussion has been had it could well be that it would be applied across the board.
Their intention is a good one, and I think moves us in the right direction, just doesn't take us far enough, partly because society is still stuck with a an out-dated view about child care.

I know what you mean about LibDems, I side with them on a lot of things too although again, I wouldn't write them off because of one thing.  True education costs is quite a big thing, but that was mainly the Tories, right at the start of a coalition. I doubt it would have gone well for the LibDems to immediately disagree with the larger power and show a division in Government.  Though I can completely understand why so many/all students were upset by it.*

I don't think you're being cynical, it is tough, just have to find a balance where you can see the good intentions of something, others that you're willing to accept if they create better things elsewhere etc.  Who knows, Green's might be complete fucking loonies, but we really don't know because we rarely hear about them and rarely does the country have a conversation about them.

*my own experience re education costs, I'm nearly 27 and have just started Open University so I applied for my first Student Financing for the degree over the summer.  I was surprised at just how little it has to be paid back.  Granted £30 a month for 30 years seems a lot, but it's only £10,000! Less than the course and £30 a month when you were over 20k isn't that noticable.  Even if you hit the next bracket and pay £67 a month by that point you'd have to earn over 30k.

I know it's much more of a principle of things when it comes to it, and I do agree, I think it's mad how much we charge for University Education, but at the same time, it's not as though we're stuck with 29k loans with mounting interest to pay back in a set amount of time.",0,1413379779,null,0,false,0,cla377k,t3_2j76mz,t1_cla377k,t1_cla1kmg,null,1426517693,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Do you think having cannabis in great quantities will be legal? Have you ever been to a country where cannabis is de-criminalised/legalised. There is a maximum amount you are allowed to carry and its usually a very small amount (1g-5g at most).

&gt;""Interesting that Labour’s Anne Begg admitted on Sky News that she had not been told the context of Lord Freud’s comments by party spinners, heavily caveating her criticism accordingly. The Adam Smith Institute have come out in support of Freud, condemning Labour for misrepresenting what he said:

&gt;“Lord Freud has been shamefully mistreated by Ed Miliband. His point was that the market value of some people’s wages is below the minimum wage. This is often true of the severely disabled and can have appalling consequences for their self-esteem and quality of life. Fixing this problem was the justification for Remploy, a government-funded firm that gave jobs to disabled people who could not find work elsewhere.

&gt;To point out that someone’s market value is less than minimum wage has nothing to do with their moral value as human beings. Freud’s point was that we should help people in this situation by allowing them to find jobs paying below the minimum wage and topping up their pay directly to make up the difference.

&gt;Even if you don’t agree with this method, it is motivated by compassion for the disabled and an understanding of the unpleasant side-effects of our minimum wage laws. Freud’s only crime was to speak bluntly: it is disgraceful to use his words against him in the way Miliband has.”

&gt;Not like a spinner to take something out of context…

&gt;UPDATE: Freud mea culpa:

&gt;“I would like to offer a full and unreserved apology. I was foolish to accept the premise of the question. To be clear, all disabled people should be paid at least the minimum wage, without exception, and I accept that it is offensive to suggest anything else.

&gt;I care passionately about disabled people…. I am profoundly sorry for any offence I have caused to any disabled people.”",0,1413379909,null,0,false,0,cla38yg,t3_2jb7lt,t1_cla38yg,t3_2jb7lt,null,1426517669,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

&gt; Thank you for contacting us regarding the BBC One programme ‘Sunday Politics’ on 12 October.

false,sync0pate,uk,West Mids,"&gt; Um... Anarchists have zero problem with inequality (of either opportunity or outcome) unless it's state sponsored somehow. In fact an anarchist would say it was really none of their business what someone else was earning\accruing.

I'm an anarchist, and this is entirely wrong. Being an anarchist is fundamentally about being against social inequality, being anti-hierarchy (An - Archy). It's literally the most important part of the theory.

Honestly you've really got all of these terms very wrong. I don't expect to ""convert"" you, but if you'd like a better understanding you can check out /r/Anarchy101 it's pretty friendly!

---

&gt;And socialism just says that the means of production should be controlled by the workers. IMHO, that would go a long way to reducing inequality. But it wouldn't stop one worker earning 10, 100, or 1,000,000 times more than another. A socialist nation still has CEOs and minimum wage earners.

It seems very unlikely to me that a socialist organisation would vote to pay the CEO 1,000,000 times the salary of the other staff. It's possible, sure, but it seems unlikely.

&gt;It really is just communism that says everyone gets the same out no matter whether they work hard or not or save and invest or not.

If you're buying privately then unless the car was grossly misrepresented at the point of sale, then in the eyes of the law, you're on your own as soon as you drive it away. 

In terms of choosing a car, buy on condition and age, not mileage.  A 2008 car with 70K miles on the clock is likely to be in better overall condition than a 2002 car with 30k miles on the clock.

However in the real world we are way beyond any natural equality.

The truth is that of those 100 island-people, they all agreed to divide the land between them and some got lucky with fertile soil, others didn't. The one's with fertile soil were able to produce lots of good things, and buy land from the others, or convince some of the less fortunate to come work for them on their fertile lands.

Pretty soon, after much trading, 2 or 3 of those 100 people had accumulated much of the wealth, most of the rest were working for them and those who weren't were just managing to get by with their own smaller plots of land.

Then they all had families, and those who had done well, handed it down to their children, who were able to take that wealth and generate even more wealth with it, including influence to make laws that keep them wealthy. Those who inherited little to nothing have no choice but to take up the jobs of their parents... and occasionally look for opportunities to gain wealth that no-one (including the wealthy - who now employ people to find opportunities for them) has discovered yet.

So you have this unequal society, some are even going hungry and those who haven't worked for their riches are using their inherited wealth to ensure that they stay rich by paying enough islanders to make favourable laws, coming up with complicated terms for money that confuse the majority of islanders and generally trying to suppress any political movements or creative ideas that favour redistributing wealth.

Now either you agree with the way things are, and are happy to let the rich get richer and the poor go hungry. Or you look to rebalance things so that every islander gets at least a fair share of the island. The trouble is, you can only do that by laws that seize some of the assets (via taxation, land grab) from the rich to redistribute to the rest.

The real question is, should the rich be able to 'own' so much of the island in the first place as to force families into poverty and rent, or should the island be considered a shared resource of which everyone benefits?",0,1413381772,null,0,false,0,cla3zkx,t3_2javlt,t1_cla3zkx,t1_cla2bd5,null,1426517324,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

Or to put it another way: the maximum the employee can get.

Wages are just a price, and like everything else in the market, the buyer wants to pay as little as possible, and the seller wants to charge as much as possible.

With employment there is an upper limit in that if you aren't a net benefit to your employer (i.e. what you earn for the company, directly or indirectly, is more than you are paid) then your employer would be insane to keep that job in existence.  Now, it's not easy to measure that net benefit, but it certainly exists.

Painting employers as if they are evil because they want to pay as little as possible for what they are purchasing is as short-sighted as painting shoppers as evil when they shop at Aldi instead of Sainsbury's -- do you want all the Sainsbury's employees to lose their jobs you evil bastard?

As long as people have opportunities, they have the power to change their own lot.  And with the power comes the responsibility.

I totally agree that inherited wealth and the tendency of wealth to accumulate are serious problems (Inheritance tax should really be 100% of anything aside from a few keep-sakes IMHO).  But as long as people have access to education and credit and there is some social safety net people can and should look after themselves.  And (IMHO, Iin the UK) access has really never been better.

I guess what I am saying is:  It's all very well saying that the islands land should be communal but what do you say when someone else sits on their arse and watches you plant, water and harvest a crop and then demands an equal share?

I think we both agree that neither feudalism (the end result of free market capitalism) nor communism will work.  We need to find a happy medium where people can expect a return when they work hard, save or take risks but where we prevent generational wealth transfers and guarantee a minimum level of access (to education, to finance, to healthcare and welfare).

*1996 vs Forest*. Tense and exciting FA Cup replay, Spurs had loads of chances. Extra-time had chance after chance either hit the post or be cleared off the line. It ended with Forest winning on penalties, but it was the first penalty shoot out I'd witnessed live a the Lane.

*1996 vs Arsenal*. Fantastic atmosphere. Spurs coming back from behind with two goals from the largely underrated partnership of Sheringham and Armstrong.

*1991 vs Oxford*. One of those difficult matches against an in-form Division 2 side. Erik Thorsvedt stopped them from scoring more and kept Spurs in the tie. Gazza was pretty amazing in his prime. I've said it elsewhere recently - Gazza and Lineker were inspired.

&gt;  If you are a bystander/victim, you have nothing to worry about. 

To ensure that this is the case, you will have to have such a high burden of proof for actually proving that charging someone is valid, given the difficulty in proving the case, I'm not sure that the measure would be a) cost-effective or b) much of a deterrent.

Somebody living on the breadline wouldn't have the same opportunity to start a business. If a poor man left his job to start a business, and that business failed, he'd go bankrupt.

If an already well off person starts a business that fails, they have a fall back.

Wealth gives you more opportunities in life. Very few, if any, millionaires started out being dirt poor. They already had some form of capital (trust fund, rich parents etc) to fall back on.

EDIT: I've just realised that I've sort of created a strawman here. Bill Gates *did* create a highly profitable business from the ground up.

false,Locke66,null,null,"While I dont disagree with what you are saying in theory I think the issue people really have is when having money just creates the opportunity to create more money to the detriment of everyone else.  

For example if I had inherited say £1 million I could go buy a few extra houses or business units in a decent area that people want to live in and rent them out for say £5000 a month.  If I had the means to repeat this multiple times over I could continuously add new properties until my income was many times in excess of what others could ever aspire to reach in their lifetimes, I could hire an agency to look after my houses/units further reducing the work load involved and when it came time for my children to inherit I would have the money to afford an expensive accountant/lawyer to find a way to bypass the inheritance tax.  The net result of all this is anyone starting out without this money is at a major disadvantage, the housing market becomes inflated and buying a house becomes totally unaffordable for the average person.  A few generations down the line and the problem just gets worse and worse as my children now start out with say £10 million and their children £100 million.

Another example of this is businesses on the stock market and how their shares are in the majority owned by people who are entirely interested in the money it can make them.  Businesses on it ""have"" to be growing to increase their value or they are seen as failing so they take more and more extreme measures to increase their profitability many of which do not actually benefit the average consumer, the employees who work for these companies or society in general.

To name a few that stand out in recent memory:

**Spurs 4-0 Young Boys** (6-3 on agg.) (2010)

This was the second leg of our Champions League qualifier to get into the group stages. We lost the first leg 3-2 after going down 3-0 in the first 30 minutes of the game. A Bassong header and a thunderbolt from Super Pav gave us hope for the return leg.

So this was our first official Champions League game at WHL. The crowd was electric, the noise was deafening and everyone got a free flag on their seat. Was a majestic sight. We completed the aggregate comeback thanks to a Peter Crouch hat-trick and a controversial Jermain Defoe goal. Unforgettable night.

**Spurs 2-1 Lyon** (2013)

This Europa League encounter was particularly special as it was an absolute Gareth Bale masterclass. The Welshman scored a dipping free-kick from 35 yards to cancel out Samuel Umtiti’s wonder-strike in the first half. 

It was in the 90th minute that Bale grabbed his brace through another free-kick from the edge of the area. It was perfect. Got it all on my phone. And to make it that much better, he celebrated literally yards away from me. I could smell the gel in his sculpted hair.

**Spurs 3-1 City** (2013)

It's already been covered but it was the last time I would see the likes of Bale and Dempsey in the lilywhite shirt. Incredible game and incredible comeback.

In the Time Lord Academy, Gallifreyans attempting to become Time Lords will often choose a name. There was a Gallifreyan that chose the name ""The Doctor"" because on Gallifrey it means ""healer, good man, or wise man"" (explained in The Name of the Doctor).

During the Time War, the Doctor still wanted to be a good man (ie he wanted to preserve the meaning of his name), so refused to become an active participant in the war. However, upon the situation of the universe being explained to him, he was given two choices: Regenerate (because his body died) into anything he needed to fight in the war, or let the universe die (explained in Name of the Doctor, seen in Night of the Doctor).

The Doctor chose to turn his back on being a good man (ie being the Doctor) and chose to regenerate into a warrior (the War Doctor [seen in Night of the Doctor]). Once the Eleventh and Tenth Doctors realised he was as much the Doctor as they were, they stopped demonising him, and he is included in the Eleventh Doctors dream of finding Gallifrey. However, only the eldest could retain the memories so as to preserve the timestream, and subsequently both the War and Tenth Doctors forgot.

false,Firefox7275,null,null,"**Name of product:** NSPA Skin Renewal Gel

**Price of product:** £4 for 125ml

**Where did you purchase:** Exclusive to Asda, two for £8 offer

**Product claims:** *""Reveal a soft, bright complexion with this kind yet effective exfoliator. There are no harsh grains, instead the gel transforms into oil after it’s worked into the skin, releasing exfoliating orange, lemon and bilberry fruit acids to break down dead skin cells. Grapeseed oil helps skin look radiant and refreshed.""*

**About you:** Sensitive eczematous skin which is easily dried out, first fine lines. I have mild papulopustular rosacea. Purchased because I am intrigued by the concept of gel to oil and impressed by the ingredients list.

**Your opinion:** This is so similar to the NSPA Melting Cleansing Gel that I do not see the point in having both. Although it is advised to use once or twice a week, the exfoliating action appears to be mild enough for daily use. The price point is incredible considering the largely natural base, little water and no mineral oil which are both super cheap ingredients.

The cleanser goes onto the skin as a super silky rather than greasy oil, yet is far less messy that a regular cleansing oil due to the gel formulation. I haven't experienced any irritation or stinging even around the delicate eye area, and it rinses squeaky clean with warm water. IMO is suitable for all skin types even sensitive due to the acidic pH.

Overall it feels, smells and looks very luxurious so I would repurchase. Not yet tested on waterproof mascara, I will update when I have.

**Ingredients:** *""Grapeseed oil, glycerin, water, sucrose laurate, bilberry fruit extract, sucrose palmitate, fragrance, Neroli flower oil, panax ginseng root extract, sugar cane extract, orange fruit extract, lemon fruit extract, sugar maple extract, apricot kernel oil, avocado oil, vitamin E, alcohol, sucrose myristate, isopropyl myristate, phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol, mica, silica, benzophenone-3, BHT, linalool, alpha-isomethyl ionone, limonene, CI 77891, CI 16035, CI 19140.""*

Tests with universal indicator paper at pH 5, not confident this is accurate because the product contains so little water.

I tend to find that one x is usually just a ""sweet"" signoff - my mam and grandma type one x when they text me, and some of my female friends and even a couple of guys who do it by force of habit.

Anything more than that can be a sign of affection, but you need to read it within the confines of your relationship with that person. If they're someone you know to be romantically interested in you, and they keep adding more kisses (xx or xxx) then perhaps they're trying to send you a sign. If you want to 'step up' your flirtiness with someone, you can add more kisses.

A good cultural equivalent in the south of Europe is kissing people when you meet them - I lived in the south of France for three months and had no idea about the etiquette or what it meant.

I'm fairly certain that we have been using ""x"" for a long while as shorthand for 'kiss' - love letters from my granda to my grandma from the 60s have x's on them.

I'm currently buying another car because of that very convenience :)

My issue is not with those who need cars (ill own 3 soon), but with those who choose to use a car as a default option for every journey, regardless of distance or weather.

And of course there are parents who wish to drop there kids off at school - but why cant the kids make the journey themselves? Most parents would say because its too dangerous (and I would agree with them). Well....you need to ask yourself why its too dangerous and what can we do about it.

And that's what I mean when I say we need an attitude change. The default is car car car. The default should be different. But I accept its not (but it could be someday!?).

false,kingofthejaffacakes,uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; The measurement of the value of work is somewhat arbitrary when it's determined by the willingness of that next nearest potential employee

Price is the great arbiter though.  Quite on the contrary from being unvalued, your value is known to the penny.  The mistake people make is to confuse value to the market, which can only offer an economic valuation in units of currency, with value as a human -- which has no reasonable scale for valuation.  Since we're talking about jobs, then only the economic valuation is relevant.

&gt; But I digress. My main bone of contention here is twofold: 1) I rankle at the idea that someone's pay ought to be determined by a label of 'disability'

I agree, you should be paid what you are worth, not according to a label.

The sad truth is that, for some jobs (certainly not all), a disability is a disadvantage.  That doesn't make you any less valuable as a human, but it might make you less valuable as a bricklayer.  Is it fair?

&gt; 2) I'm cynical enough to suspect this approach could be expanded to erode the concept of the minimum wage on a wider scale.

I'd be glad; the minimum wage is bad for exactly the reasons Lord Freud has observed in relation to the disabled.  If your labour is not worth the minimum wage (regardless of whether you are disabled or not), then a job for you cannot exist.  The minimum wage doesn't raise wages, it lowers the number of jobs.

For example, here's what a below-minimum wage cashier looks like:

http://sayanythingblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/self-checkout.jpg

Those machines exist because of the minimum wage, the employees they replaced have not had an increase in wage, they have a decrease in job.

My personal solution to the minimum wage problem is to scrap it, and in fact most other benefits, replacing them with a citizens income, where _everyone_ receives a standard payment, and then each contributes according to income.  That is the least distorting method, and leaves those above the average net worse off (as it should be) and those below average better off.  Then we can argue about how much citizen's income should be, and leave business to negotiate wages without government intervention.",0,1413388785,null,0,1413389513,0,cla79da,t3_2jb7lt,t1_cla79da,t1_cla5ra9,null,1426515786,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I struggle to see why people are so hostile to this.  Also for the record I never asked for a smoking ban, it was made due to the arguments for health benefits.

This isn't a nanny state issue banning people smoking at home.

This is about a shared public resource.  What amazes me is the level of outright hostility towards this issue.

If someone smokes, it has an impact on others, there is an environmental concern.  [The majority of the population does not smoke](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/causes/tobacco-statistics/) so to me it's just a question of how much of a benefit is it to those who smoke, being able to do so in a park vs the cost to others.  It's one persons enjoyment against anothers.

So we've got less than 20% of the population who smoke, I wonder what percentage of people find smoke irritating?  Heck one in twelve are been treated for Asthma alone, so some may even have medical issues with it, I know that pre-smoking ban I had to use more steroids, but this is just anecdotal rather than real objective analysis.

To me it comes down to a simple benefit / cost analysis, of a shared public resource.

&gt;Thank you for contacting us about the proposed format for the 2015 General Election debates. We have received a wide range of feedback from supporters of different political parties across the UK. In order to use our TV licence fee resources efficiently, this response aims to answer the key concerns, but we apologise in advance if it doesn’t address your specific points in the manner you would prefer.

&gt;The BBC is working with other broadcasters to try and make election debates happen in 2015 and we believe we have set out a fair and realistic formula. Twenty two million people saw some of the debates in 2010. They were very successful in engaging the electorate, especially first time voters and the broadcasters would like them to happen again at next year’s general election. We are also putting forward our own proposals for other debates across the UK.

&gt;Ensuring impartiality during an election campaign is a priority and judgements about debates, and other programmes, are taken on the basis of objective editorial assessments of a number of factors, including the levels of past and current electoral support for each party.

&gt;Although UKIP did not win a seat in the 2010 general election, they polled more than three times as many votes as the Green Party, which did win a seat. In the 2014 European elections, UKIP topped the poll, beating all the Westminster parties in terms of seats (24) and share of the vote (more than 27% - up more than 10% on 2009). The Greens won three seats in the European election, with just under 8% of the vote (a small drop since 2009).

&gt;UKIP have also performed strongly in local government elections in England for the past two years and have more councillors than the Greens. Before their victory in Clacton, UKIP had come second in every Westminster by-election for the last two years – the Greens’ best performance was around 4%.

&gt;We also take account of opinion polls, when there is a robust and consistent trend: UKIP have been regularly polling in the mid-teens for more than two years, well ahead, for instance, of the Liberal Democrats and around 10 percentage points ahead of the Greens.

&gt;In Scotland, the BBC is proposing a debate, in peak time on BBC One, involving the leaders of the SNP, Scottish Labour, the Scottish Conservative and Scottish Liberal Democrat parties. We are proposing a similar format of debate on BBC One from Wales, involving the leaders of Plaid Cymru, Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and UKIP. We have written to the parties to begin discussions about our proposals and we will ensure impartiality during the Election in Scotland and Wales. Full details of our content will be released over the coming months once they are finalised.

&gt;We hope this goes some way in addressing your concerns, thanks again for taking the time to contact us.

Similarly, a person with a learning disability might not be any good at those jobs, but might make an excellent bricklayer. I used to know a fella who worked as a choreographer despite his severe cerebral palsy, as he pointed out (slowly, due to him having to use an electronic communication aid), he spent much more time thinking about movement than most able bodied people, and it made him damn good at his job.

I'm sure you are correct; but in those particular case they will certainly be paid as much as their non-disabled counterparts.  We're not talking about particular cases though, those cherry-picked ones were you find a perfect fit.  We're talking about those cases were the disabled person is not a perfect fit for a job.  In those cases, the minimum wage means they are unemployable because (as the minister said) they aren't ""worth"" the minimum wage, so saying that companies are ""getting away"" with something because they don't want to end up out of pocket seems to be demanding too much of companies.

Is it fair?  No of course not; but then being disabled in the first place isn't fair.  Life isn't fair.  There are some who are cleverer, more handsome, better at sports, have good memories, are artistic, are personable, are good leaders, etc, etc.  No one is equally gifted, and some people get a rough hand dealt to them, some get a positively negative hand dealt to them.  Legislation can't fix that.  As an enlightened welfare society, we can try to ease the burden of those who are in such a position, but we shouldn't do it by passing King Cnut style acts of parliament.  We ask companies to pay taxes, which they do, and that is already their duty done for welfare.

Nah.  Just because someone tried to find some number (£20,000 in your example) doesn't mean that's what we're each worth.

What is the value of the human who would have cured cancer had only the NHS allocated £22,000 for their care, but died because a vital piece of equipment wasn't available when they were in a skiing accident?  What's the value of the child killer who ruins 100 lives?  What's the value of the father to the son?  What's the value of the father to the stranger?  What's the value of the man who pushes the millionaire philanthropist from out of the way of an oncoming bus?  Is the man who accidentally runs over the next Adolph Hitler worth more or less than that?

There is no reasonable answer to any of those questions, and no sensible scale for measuring human worth.  It is both subjective and non-quantifiable.  It's certainly not ""what the NHS budget for them"".

&gt; humans and money are both finite, and you can convert from one to the other.

Economically, yes.  Otherwise, no.  Any one kilo of lead is replaceable with any other.  Any one human is not replaceable with any other.

&gt; In the other direction, people sell parts of their lives to employers in return for a salary.

How things are said is the be all and end all.  The arts wouldn't exists if different ways of saying the same thing didn't matter.  

&gt;Actually it's a true thing to say. Some people cannot earn a company more money than the minimum wage they have to be paid. Thus they are not worth the wage, since the company loses money employing them. Therefore, they stay unemployed. It's a fairly simple concept.

None of that fairly simple concept has anything to do with being disabled though.  I assume all the lazy able-bodied twats at work will have their wages cut to reflect what they lose the companies everyday?  I also assume that the C-level executives who bring fuck all in and rely on their teams of sales and support staff to do all money making, they'll be cut to £2 an hour too?

The different names given to this payment from time to time reflect the current social attitude to those who receive it.

**Welfare:** When the whole concept of the welfare state was born out of the mass poverty generated by the industrial revolution, the subsistence paid in money or in kind to those in need took the name: welfare. This is still the generic name by which it is universally known. I believe that in other countries this basic survival payment is known by other names. The most universal is, however, still welfare, but bearing in mind its miserly magnitude, I cannot imagine anybody ever faring well on it!

**The 'Social':** When I first became unemployed this payment was commonly known as Social Security, or colloquially simply as the Social. It was viewed as a safety net against destitution. It reflected an attitude that every human being should be protected from starvation and homelessness. As such, anybody who was deemed to need it received it.

**Income Support:** Later the name of the state subsistence payment was changed to Income Support. The idea was that everybody, no matter who they were or whatever their means, was obliged to try to obtain an income through their own initiative. However, if the free-market worth of their labour were not sufficient for them to subsist, then the state would top it up or support it with an extra payment. The attitude of society-at-large was that everybody needed - and should by some means receive - an income sufficient for the purpose of sustaining their lives. However, in my case, as I suspect for most, the term 'support' was a misnomer. It did not merely support my income: it was my income.

**Job-Seeker's Allowance:** Later still, the name was changed again to Job-Seeker's Allowance. This reflected a hardening of social attitude. This name implied that everybody had an obligation to find paid work and that the payment was specifically to meet the expenses of seeking that paid work. If any recipient found himself for any reason unable to convince the relevant authority that he was actively seeking work then the payment was stopped. It reflected the hardening attitude that if one were not seen to be seeking paid work - for any reason - then one had no right to live.

That is happening despite the financial industry, not because of it.

The other thing capitalists are happy to crow about is the wealth generated from tapping into millions of years of energy reserve, aka fossil fuels, but that wasn't exactly the free lunch they made it out to be either, was it (carbon emmisions)?  No one will doubt the efficiency of capitalism to exploit natural resources and local labor.  What we are questioning is if this is a good deal for the worker as is being promised.  What we are questiong is privatized profits with publicly sudsidized costs, as happens again and again as the capitalists leave a trail of pollution and destruction for the rest of us to clean up.

And if you are living in the first world, you might say yes, because you are a beneficiary of the collective oppression of capitalist markets on the third world that keeps your labor over valued relative to the worker in China.

false,BooksBiscuitsTea,null,null,"&gt;To head off claims of a back-door tax rise, the Government would offset the £5-a-week payments by reducing workers’ national insurance contributions.

&gt;The payments from workers would raise £8bn a year, £2bn of which would go into an unemployment insurance scheme. It would replace the £72-a-week contributory jobseeker’s allowance (JSA), currently payable for six months to people who have been in work for two years regardless of their savings. The 4.6 million self-employed would qualify for the first time.

&gt;The other £6bn raised would go into the individual accounts.

&gt;Under the proposed scheme, the jobless could increase their benefit by £20 a week by dipping into their personal welfare account and draw it for longer than six months.

&gt;If they wished, higher earners could pay in up to an extra £100 a week, and could use their fund to retrain if they lost their job or during other emergencies such as ill-health. If they did not need the money during their working life, it would provide a £10,000 top-up to their pension pot when they retired.

Getting past the knee-jerk DAE Tory killing Welfare recipients response, there are aspects to this that aren't that daft. The idea of allowing people to offset an element of NI contributions into a sort of unemployment insurance scheme isn't that bad an idea.

Provided it's implemented in such a way that doesn't hinder the current system. So, for example, say I opt to pay £25 a month. According to the proposal £5 of that would be offset against my NI contributions, so it'd cost me £20 a month / £240 a year.

If, after three years I lost my job, that'd be £720. If the Government expected me to dip into that as a replacement for contribution based JSA? That'd piss me the fuck off, not to put too fine a point on it.

If, however, I could still claim contribution-based JSA and in addition, tap into that £720 at a pre-determined rate that didn't count as income - so it wouldn't' affect any welfare claims, I think that's not too bad an idea.

Of course, it'd be much easier for the Government not to stick their oar in, in the first place. Or why it should be run by private companies, for that matter.",0,1413392673,null,0,false,0,cla9cln,t3_2jbw8s,t1_cla9cln,t3_2jbw8s,null,1426514812,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I got a catalogue through the door this week that rather brought home the reality of how bad things have got.

The catalogue was for PS4's, TVs and mobile phones on a 3 year financing, and the company has door-to-door collectors who take payment each week.

Weekly payments and door-to-door collectors reminds me of how my dad talked about growing up poor in Oldham in the 1940s, but what astonished me was how much of a markup people are paying for their immediate gratification.

Each page had the offerings marked up as ""only £399"" or whatever, but then at the bottom it had a table showing the weekly payments and the real prices. People are paying £5 a week over 3 years for this stuff, and in exchange for credit they're effectively paying a markup of 35% or 40% over retail.

In a free market, you may earn half as much as everyone else for being half as productive, but if they earn £12/hour, paying you £6/hour would be illegal. Instead of being unemployable, the government may decide to allow the company to hire you for a fair wage of £6/hour, and then supplement that to ensure you receive more than you would if you were still unemployed. 

In theory, it should save the government money as the company is providing some of your income through a wage, and it allows you to get a job to increase your income rather than being unemployable and limited to disability benefits. It could work through some sort of taxation-like system, where for every £10 you earn you lose maybe £1 of benefits.

You might go from £8,000/year (?) benefit money and no job to £7,200/year benefit money and an £8,000 salary despite earning only getting £6 an hour wage. The company would not be greatly affected by it, the government would save up to £800 and you would get more money and the ability to  have a job if you wanted one.

At &gt;9,000 words long enjoy Barroso's thoughts on the future. Notably:-

&gt;*Here is maybe the moment to make a comment on the relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom. I passionately believe that Europe is stronger with the UK as its member, and that the UK is stronger as a member of the European Union than on its own. But I do acknowledge that for historical, geopolitical and economic reasons the case of the UK may be seen as a special one. Precisely because of this, it would be a mistake to transform an exception for the UK into a rule for everybody else. We can, and should, find ways to cater to the UK's specificity, inasmuch as this does not threaten the Union's overall coherence.*

&gt;*But we should not confound this specificity – even if in some issues it is shared at some moments by several governments – with an overall situation of the Union.*

Whether or not colonialism is economically beneficial to the colonizer has been disputed since Adam Smith. They do provide a military advantage and allow certain goods to be imported that could not be otherwise, but colonies have always been very expensive to maintain.

Train is out because by the time I've paid to park at the station all weekend (£9) and driven there (£8 round trip) then paid for two single tube journeys at the other end (~£7.40) then bought the train ticket itself (£78.50 for a super off peak return)

Expected goals is how much a player would expect to score, based on the shots they've taken. Where the shot was taken, whether it was a header, if it was from a cross, a through ball, a counterattack, after beating a defender off the dribble, etc. This guy (Michael Caley) has written a whole lot on developing this metric at Cartilage Free Captain, [here](http://cartilagefreecaptain.sbnation.com/2014/9/11/6131661/premier-league-projections-2014#methoderology)

So a typical Andros Townsend shot would contribute maybe 0.1 expected goals (10% chance of going in), whereas Chadli, after snatching up a Lamela through ball into the box, would shoot for maybe .6 expected goals (60% chance of a goal).

Expected assists just measure how many expected goals the player assists - so Lamela would get .6 expected assists from that through ball, and Dier or whoever passed to Townsend would get .1.",0,1413395644,null,0,false,0,claaz6b,t3_2j965e,t1_claaz6b,t3_2j965e,null,1426514053,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

&gt;Yesterday evening, if you were fortunate enough to tune into Newsnight, you would have been privy to the ultimate expression of Slackerism, a political theory with roots in teenage angst, mild rebelliousness, and a pie-in-the-sky leftism that wants to pull down the walls of the politics then sit around smoking pot in the ruins. Russell Brand was being interviewed by Paxman. It was a car crash.

Pulling down society without a plan to replace it is just a way to ruin us all. The young need to vote more, stop being lazy and get out to just do it. I've been encouraging my peers to do so from an early age and it seems now approaching my mid-twenties my peers are starting to take notice.

A lack of vote is just as Johnny Rotten said:

&gt;“If you’re not voting, not contributing, you’re demanding to be ignored. Not very smart at all. You don’t get nothing because you’ve done nothing. Stand up and be counted, make your voice heard or else you’re just going to fade into insignificance. You can see it, can’t you!”

If you don't vote, you have no voice and achieve nothing. If the situation is really so terrible you don't want to vote for anyone, stand up as the local MP yourself. You can't change things by sitting on your ass doing nothing and expecting the Gods to change things for you.",0,1413396574,null,0,false,0,clabhe7,t3_2jbs6k,t1_clabhe7,t3_2jbs6k,null,1426513820,2,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,2

It comes down to the fact that he is, at his core, the same man.  Or, the same Time Lord as it were.  They recognize that there are a certain number of bodies, but not a number of different Doctors.  I haven't seen *The Five Doctors*, but I just found the transcript and could not find any instance of any one of them saying anything close to ""I'm the Xth Doctor.""  The closest I could find was this exchange:

Hurdnall: Me? Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so. Regeneration?

Davison: Fourth.

But he seems to be referring to the number of regenerations/bodies he's had.  This doesn't, to me, sound like he's referring to himself as a different Doctor.  Hurdnall does say, ""the original if you will,"" but he again seems to be referring to the body, not necessarily to himself as a different Doctor.

The only point I know of at which he says anything even suggesting he is a different man is when Tennant is lamenting his future regeneration and says, ""Some new man goes sauntering away, and I'm dead.""  But this point is countered later by Smith when he confirms that Tennant's incarnation had vanity issues which likely led to his attitude towards his pending regeneration, an attitude which no other incarnation shared.  It is countered again by Smith and Capaldi in *Deep Breath* when, after Smith's phone call with Clara, Capaldi knows exactly what they discussed.  Clara says Capaldi shouldn't have been listening in on her call and he says, ""I wasn't. I didn't need to.

That is currently partly determined by their employer, who will pay them more if they are thought to be a possible inventor of the cure for cancer. That salary may then be used to buy expensive health insurance, ensuring they live where otherwise they would die. The NHS does not currently price that in, as the NHS only value the years of healthy life of those eligible to be treated. Why that is is complicated, as it involves the values of the electorates, governments and others in the UK since the 1940s.

&gt;What's the value of the child killer who ruins 100 lives?

We currently partly determine that through the budget for the police, who may be able to stop them, for the education department, who may be able to decrease their chance of offending through better education, for the NHS, who may be able to detect they are a threat and give them counselling to reduce the risk of that happening, and so on.

&gt; What's the value of the father to the son? What's the value of the father to the stranger?

The value of the father is usually higher to the son than to the stranger. We can see this through the relative willingness of people to pay ransoms of various sizes for family members as opposed to strangers. We can look at this data to work out the rough difference in value for the father between the stranger and the son. 

&gt;What's the value of the man who pushes the millionaire philanthropist from out of the way of an oncoming bus?

We can get an idea of the value of a philanthropist to a man by seeing how much money it would take for a man to push a philanthropist in front of a bus, and comparing this to the amount it would take for a man to push someone else in front of a bus. The value of the philanthropist will be higher to some people than to others.

If a Welshman would kill philanthropists for £10 a go, but a Lithuanian would kill them for €1,000, we can convert between pounds and euros at a rate of 100:1 if we have enough philanthropists to be murdered. 

&gt; Is the man who accidentally runs over the next Adolph Hitler worth more or less than that?

The value of the Hitler-killer may be lower than the philanthropist-saver for a philanthropy beneficiary, but higher for a Jewish person who does not need any charity. The economic value for the world could go either way. If killing this Hitler led to a more effective Hitler then the Hitler-killer would probably be less valuable. 


Your examples are impossible to accurately value as there are too many unknown variables, not because humans are somehow beyond value. We can get a good idea of the value of human life through things like ransom prices and government budgets though, but even then there are other variables to consider (such as paying a ransom increasing the likelihood of further kidnappings).",0,1413397681,null,0,1413398238,0,clac35j,t3_2jb7lt,t1_clac35j,t1_cla8yjl,null,1426513535,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The context of the question was that those disabled people he worls with were unable to get minimum wage jobs because their ability to carry out work was two or three times (at least) less than others (including other disabled people). This left them sitting at home feeling they had no purpose in life, furthering their mental illness.

The question asked was, wouldn't it make more sense to allow companies to pay less than minimum wage to some specially selected workers in order to get them meaningful employment which would benefit both society and the mental wellbeing of the disabled people concerned. The intent would then be that the government would top up their wages to at least the value of the minimum wage. This would be a win for everyone, on all levels. It may even work out slightly cheaper in benefits for the government allowing the money to be diverted to other projects.

Paying less than the minimum wage this way is not something that is new, and it certainly isn't something that is just for the disabled. In areas of high unemployment the government has incentives for employers to employ people under the age of 25 where they will pay half of the employees wages to help them learn skills and get them off of the dole.

Prior to his election to the Assembly, he was an adviser to [First Minister of Northern Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Northern_Ireland) [David Trimble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Trimble). He stood for the [party leadership in 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Unionist_Party_leadership_election,_2005) along with [Alan McFarland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_McFarland) and Lord [Reg Empey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reg_Empey) which Empey went on to win. Following the contest, he was appointed as the UUP education spokesman.  He is a former chairman of the [Ulster Young Unionist Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Young_Unionist_Council).

There are certain ""tourist traps"" which will charge you a lot of money for an underwhelming experience. So don't bother. Madam Tussauds in particular is fucking awful and fucking expensive. 

In London, there are *hundreds* of fantastic events, exhibitions, museums, art galleries, etc., etc., which are completely free. Off the top of my head, check out the Imperial War Museum, British Museum, Tate &amp; Tate Modern, Science Museum, Natural History Museum, and so on. All have free admission (although you might be charged for special exhibits). 

If you want to avoid being ripped off for food or water, try to avoid buying anything in central London. If you visit a newsagent in Central, you *will* pay an exorbitant amount. Avoid them like the plague. Stock up before you leave.

Walk around! Walk along the Thames, explore Covent Garden (they've got a really cool ""levitating building"" thing at the moment, check it out), relax in one of the many, many parks. Go to Camden and get a cheapish pint in a dirty dive bar. Check out the street performers. Maybe go to Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park and listen to a lunatic rant at you through a megaphone.

&gt; http://policy.greenparty.org.uk/ar.html

I don't think you read your own link.

It says here:

&gt; AR414 The Green Party would ban all experimentation and research which harms animals, including harmful procedures used to obtain animal-derived materials. 'Harmful' is defined in this context as 'having the potential to cause pain, suffering, distress, lasting harm or death in animals, except where it is designed to benefit the individual animals concerned

&gt; AR415 Government research funds will be transferred from animal tests to non-animal technologies, including epidemiology, computer models, micro-dosing, imaging, DNA chips, microfluidics chips and the use of human tissue. Much greater use will be made of epidemiological evidence and clinical data. Greens would also fund more research into prevention of disease, looking at diet, environment, family history and lifestyle.

&gt;AR416 The Green Party is opposed to the harmful use in education of animals and of animal-derived materials where the animals have been killed specifically for this purpose. The Party supports the replacement of the use of animals and animal material with methods such as models, mannequins, mechanical and computer-based simulators, films and interactive videos, plant experiments and observational and field studies, and human studies including self-experimentation. The Party supports the educational use of animal cadavers and animal-derived materials where these have been ethically sourced, such as animals who have died naturally and animals who have been euthanased for humane reasons.

Saying ""want to ban animal testing"" is stretching the truth there by quite a bit...

EDIT: I just remembered that Liberal Democrat Norman Baker wanted what you say, ""ban animal testing"", only a few months ago I think...

Here we go:

""Minister Norman Baker wants end to UK animal tests""  
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-28580792

and Reddit UK's response to it I found is here:  
https://pay.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2c89wa

From the BBC article:

&gt; ...Chris Magee, of the Understanding Animal Research campaign, expressed reservations about Mr Baker's call for an end to testing.

&gt; He said: ""I think we all agree that alternatives should be developed and used wherever possible, and it should be noted that more than 15,000 fewer animals were used in 2013 than 2012. It is already against the law to use an animal for research if there's an alternative method available.

&gt; ""We should also be clear that it is illegal to test cosmetics or their ingredients on animals. Experiments are for medical, scientific, veterinary and environmental research, and over half of experiments are the breeding of genetically altered animals, mainly mice.

&gt; ""We have long argued for increased funding for developing alternatives and reform of Section 24, however a hurdle to the minister's vision may be that a great deal of research is about discovering how biological systems work in the first place. You cannot simulate the unknown.""

What is the difference between what the Green Party and the Animal Research campaign spokesperson is saying?

I just cooked a lovely cajun stir fry chicken pasta with some veg and cajun sauce and it was lovely. 

fuck all effort too - pasta is easy to do, the rest you just fry up in a pan onions and peppers (sainsburys sell frozen chopped versions of both so no need to get fresh in) give them a few mins to fry up , chop up and add 100g of chicken per person , keep stirring it, add [this](http://greatbritishfood.de/images/articles/3577b970b6a9d51fad17625fcfd5ac67_5.jpg) sauce for flavour , stir more. Add some pesto as well for a little more flavour, and whatever mixed spices you like. 

takes 15-20 mins (i used pre-cooked chicken in this case, if you have to fully fry it might take a little but not much longer), and is delicious. And now i have more for tomorrow :D",0,1413399635,null,0,false,0,clad5k0,t3_2jcc7a,t1_clad5k0,t3_2jcc7a,null,1426512968,4,false,TheRedLion,t5_2vrbs,4

The context of the question was that those disabled people he worls with were unable to get minimum wage jobs because their ability to carry out work was two or three times (at least) less than others (including other disabled people). This left them sitting at home feeling they had no purpose in life, furthering their mental illness.

The question asked was, wouldn't it make more sense to allow companies to pay less than minimum wage to some specially selected workers in order to get them meaningful employment which would benefit both society and the mental wellbeing of the disabled people concerned. The intent would then be that the government would top up their wages to at least the value of the minimum wage. This would be a win for everyone, on all levels. It may even work out slightly cheaper in benefits for the government allowing the money to be diverted to other projects.

Paying less than the minimum wage this way is not something that is new, and it certainly isn't something that is just for the disabled. In areas of high unemployment the government has incentives for employers to employ people under the age of 25 where they will pay half of the employees wages to help them learn skills and get them off of the dole.

If Kane is a good dribbler to your eyes, I'd highly recommend you expand your football viewing. I think he still holds decent potential especially because dribbling ability is one of the easier traits to improve and he's surprisingly intelligent with his passing, but he does still have a ways to go in the dribbling category.

As for Bentaleb, he simply offers no forward drive or incisive play. We are simply far too toothless when he plays the role, but rather solid when he's playing a set No 6. He's very good at reading and breaking up play, but not good enough of yet at flipping to attack. Just far too safe with his passing. It's no coincidence Poch was lamenting how poor we were to get the ball forward from midfield in the beginning of the season (especially in his postmatch comments after West Brom), and since then Bentaleb has been dropped in favor of Mason.

Our midfield play of the last two seasons has been appalling for our level. Extremely lacking in incisiveness and forward push, with plenty of lethargy, horizontal thinking, and safe play.

Bentaleb a better distributor though? I think we may agree on more than it may seem from these posts, but I can't agree with that. Bentaleb may be more accurate, but Mason is far more effective because of how quickly he releases and how quickly he gets the ball forward. There is absolutely no coincidence that Poch commented on how frustrated he was with our forward transitional play from midfield on multiple occasions, and Bentaleb has since been dropped for Mason.

Indeed, but missing a turn in the promotion queue is obviously not the same as having your wages cut by two-thirds.  

&gt;What world do you live in? How else is a business supposed to function? Everything is a value judgement, the company needs to make money to continue to provide its goods and services to its customers. 

Spoken like a true blue.  Just because businesses do something, doesn't mean it's the *right* way to do something.  If these people are so disabled a business will give them £2 an hour for their troubles, chances are these people shouldn't be working.  That's what the state is there for.  But then he wouldn't like that either I'm sure.  So the best solution is to put them to work for a pittance.  Businesses get their hour of work for just above slave labour rates, and the state pays less to support the vulnerable in society.  He reaps his share of his investment in said companies, and gets a pat on the back from his Tory chums. 

&gt;Trying to make a value judgement in business is something a cunt would do?

Read the post again.  Making that judgement along the lines of percieved disability is something a cunt would do.  Who the fuck is he to say what level of ""ability"" would be deemed to be up to the minimum wage requirements (which would be a mockery anyway, since this would effectively destroy the minimum wage).  The government can't even get disability *benefit* assessments right, let alone assements to deprive people of a basic wage.

This is very true, but it isn't Bentaleb specifically. Opposing teams know that we're very horizontal in our passing from deep, but rather threatening once we have Eriksen especially in space (and now Lamela). So the key is choke off our midfield finding Eriksen centrally, because after that point we actually have bite. If our midfielders had broader skillsets (this includes Mason unfortunately as he still has room for improvement in this regard) including speed and aggression to drive the ball forward at their feet, then we would force the opposition to change their gameplan/open up those choked off central channels. 

This is why I like Bentaleb as a No 6 but with the freedom to get forward on occasion.

false,jagershark,null,null,"&gt; If he earned it honestly then what is the problem?

The problem is the inequality of opportunity in the first place. 

Most rich people come from rich families. The best way to generate wealth is not to be hard working and innovative but to have lots of wealth in the first place.  Sure there are a few examples of people who've made it from a market stall in the East End of London to being a billionaire, but these people are very rare. I've never heard of a single Pakistani orphan in a sweatshop who went on to become a billionaire.

The real question is, when we design the structure of our society, what should be rewarded? 

Should race or gender be rewarded? Of course not. We all agree that earning more than someone similar because you are a different race is somehow wrong. Why is it wrong? Because it's an arbitrary characteristic that you had no control over. 

If you define the value of a person in a strictly capitalist sense, a woman of child-bearing age is less valuable than a similar man of the same age. I, though not all, agree that a pay gap should not exist despite this. (Whether or not a pay gap actually does exist is actually irrelevant here.)

What about intelligence? Does a naturally bright kid who does well in school and becomes a successful accountant or engineer deserve double or triple what the unintelligent child who ends up working just as hard in a warehouse earns? Are these two humans not equally valuable? Most capitalists would say 'No' - that's where I fundamentally disagree.

Most of what goes in to making a person wealthy is completely out of their control. The country they were born is a huge factor, as is their parental income/education. Luck is of course very important. Hard work, or whatever it is you decide deserves reward, actually plays a very small part.

I would go as far as to say that people do not deserve wealth that they did not earn. And most rich people did not 'earn' most, if any, of their outrageous wealth - they gained that wealth as a result of factors beyond their control.

The solution? I don't know. How about a global wealth tax and large scale redistribution of wealth to make the world less unequal? Study after study has shown that any income over ~$75,000 a year has no correlation with happiness and well-being anyway. Nobody needs or deserves a millionaire's lifestyle while there are billions of people short of food.

I admit I misanlysed the change from 2012 to 2013 but immigration figures are up this year, contra the year before. 560k people settled in the uk during the year up to March 2014. The previous year, i.e. the year to March 2013, that figure was 492k. This year was essentially the same number of migrants as in 2012. 

According to [this](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/migration1/migration-statistics-quarterly-report/august-2012/index.html), it's broadly the same as it had been since 2004. 

So, since 2004, with a trough in the year to March 2013, and statistically insignificant fluctuations otherwise, immigration has stayed broadly the same.

Below that is the medium-term policy:

&gt; MG300 We will work to achieve greater equity between the UK and non-Western countries. In step with this, we will progressively reduce UK immigration controls.

i.e. accepting that unlimited immigration could not be immediately imposed, and finally the short-term policies, which are ones conceivably achievable over one five-year term:

&gt; MG400 We will replace existing British Immigration law with an Immigration law which does not discriminate directly on the grounds listed above (see MG205). This law will be based on the principle of fair and prompt treatment of applicants rather than on excluding dishonest applicants whatever the cost to the honest ones. We will consult widely with affected groups to ensure that features of the current law which are of concern to them are addressed.

&gt; MG401 We will allow the partners, prospective partners, immediate families and prospective families of British residents to join them without excessive delays or unreasonable requirements for proof of relationship. This will be independent of the financial status of the resident and will not be dependent on her/him providing accommodation (We recognise that this must be implemented in association with a housing policy).

&gt; MG402 A person's right to stay will not be linked to that of partners or families but will be independent. Families will not be divided by deportation unless the deportee poses a serious danger to public safety.

&gt; MG403 We will abolish the 'primary purpose' rule under which partners are refused entry if it is thought that the primary purpose of relationship is for them to gain entry to the UK.

If a disabled person can't get hired on a measly wage of £6.50 an hour, but are instead given a job if they agree to work for even less it may allow some employers to automatically lower the wages of any new disabled applicant to £2 an hour.  

Even if the £2 an hour wage were only legally implemented under a scheme (similar to apprenticeships) then an employer would be able to say ""I'll just take disabled people from this scheme so I can lower my costs"", shutting some people out of fair pay for their work.  

Yes I would rather be working than sitting around the house if I were disabled, but if the government can put effort into creating new jobs for others which pay minimum wage or more, why should disabled people not be given the same too?

These are not mutually exclusive. 

&gt;Why is attacking Iran in the interest of of USA?

Because Iran is perceived to be an obstacle to US interests in the region. It's especially a threat because it can close the Strait of Hormuz. If Iran gets nuclear weapons then it becomes an obstacle that's difficult to shift.

&gt;The main beneficiary of this is Israel. This is nothing more that the US taxpayer buying american weapons for Israel. Talking about america ""benefiting"" is disingenuous.

The US doesn't benefit from the arms sales. Some US businesses and investors who lobby and donate benefit.

&gt;The american bases in Suadi, Qatar, Oman Kuwait and Bahrain are all better placed to help america in the it fights in the middle east.

There are no US bases in KSA any more. [The US presence in KSA tended to upset people.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2984547.stm) Qatar and Kuwait have been funding IS and are unreliable. Bahrain is unstable. One of the motivations of invading Iraq was to create a US dependency, and look how that worked out. 

&gt;But again this idea that Israel is the 51st state in the middle east is NOT based on evidence. 

Israel's marketing department would like people to think that, but it's not the case. Nevertheless Israel has its uses in meeting US regional objectives.

Where we have to be careful is in assuming that Israel also helps the UK meet its objectives. [The US and Israel have been aggressively marketing the idea that UK interests are very much aligned to those of the US and Israel.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic_Bridge)  This is an assumption I would question.

You've already made your decision, and now you're only accepting arguments that fit. There are quite a few millionaires - I don't know their stories. I'm sure most of them, at some point in their life, came across some opportunity that, in your mind, disqualifies them. Oh well.

I'm also sure a lot of poverty-stricken people had that opportunity at some point and didn't take that, but I very much doubt that matters to you.

I don't know much about him, but [Duncan Bannatyne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Bannatyne)? He apparently has &gt;£100m. 

&gt; As a child Duncan lived in one room with his parents and siblings in a large house shared with 6 other families.

&gt; He only enjoyed PE and woodwork at the High School and left at 15 without any qualifications.

&gt; In 1964 after a few weeks working for a local cabinet-maker he joined the Royal Navy, initially enlisting for twelve years as a junior second class engineering mechanic (stoker) at RNTE Shotley near Ipswich, better known as the boys' training establishment HMS Ganges. He served in the Navy for several years including a spell on the aircraft carrier HMS Eagle, before receiving a dishonourable discharge for throwing an officer off a boat landing jetty in Scotland.

&gt; Bannatyne was nineteen years old when this happened. After the incident he had to serve nine months in Colchester military detention centre before being discharged aged 20.[3] He later spent ten days in Glasgow's Barlinnie prison for not paying a £10 fine in relation to a charge of breach of the peace and resisting arrest.

&gt; Bannatyne spent his twenties moving from one job to another.

&gt; He has stated that he was penniless and did not have a bank account until the age of 30

There are services that check your cars history, some are free, others charge. One service that comes to mind is www.totalcarcheck.co.uk (never used the service myself but friends have)

You can also check the MOT history at www.gov.uk and search MOT.

In terms of the insurance, you can get that all sorted before you purchase the car. When you speak to your chosen insurer, tell them you don't own the vehicle yet, but will buy the car on Saturday, and wish the insurance to start on Saturday. May be easier doing it at home then on the roadside/garage forecourt.

As for the tax, I believe it works of a monthly basis, eg. buying the tax on Saturday, will cover you to the end of October next year (if you buy 12 months). So in effect your tax year will run from 1st October 2014 to 31st October 2015.

It will be worth, if you haven't done so already, getting a garage/or mechanic you trust a quick once over to double check everything is as it should be, preferably before you hand over any more money, but if you can't do it whilst its in its guarantee period.

Cirrhosis of the liver is mostly seen in old piss-heads but not exclusively.

**Education**
------------------------------
There are monumental benefits to having an All Island approach to Education, especially in Regards to research and development, that would [benefit the whole Island](http://www.hea.ie/sites/default/files/cross_border_programme_for_research_and_education_contributing_to_peace_and_reconcilliation.pdf)

&gt; In 2003, the National Centre for Sensor Research at DCU (Dublin) and the Northern Ireland
&gt; Bioengineering Centre at UUJ (Belfast) developed a strategy to establish an internationally
&gt; competitive Virtual Centre in Point of Care Technology. The centre was to be known as POC-
&gt; Sensors Ireland. The Cross-Border Programme provided the opportunity to put the strategy
&gt; into effect for potential long term economic and social benefit, on the island of Ireland.

There are huge undertakings already underway to fund collectively research projects between Universities on an [All-Ireland Basis.](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/universities-in-northern-ireland-given-access-to-republics-funding-scheme/2010791.article)

&gt; The agreement to permit Queen’s University Belfast and the University of Ulster to participate in Science Foundation Ireland’s Investigators Programme was signed on 22 January by Stephen Farry, Northern Ireland’s employment and learning minister, and Richard Bruton, the Republic’s minister for jobs, enterprise and innovation.
&gt; 
&gt; The agreement – which comes with an £8.4million funding pledge from the Northern Ireland Executive - will apply specifically to collaborative projects involving universities from both jurisdictions; Northern Irish universities will remain unable to apply for awards in their own right.
&gt; 
&gt; Mr Farry said the initiative provided a “real opportunity to develop new cross-border research collaborations with the potential, in the longer term, to bring further success under Horizon 2020, the European Commission’s latest research framework programme and a major priority for both governments”.

There are other areas especially in the Border region where there is a [massive dissconnect](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-17581757) between the needs of a local community as opposed to the invisible boundary that demarcates both states.

&gt; ""We have growing cross-border travel in terms of health care, now we are looking at education. How can we improve the service in terms of education for border communities?""
&gt; 
&gt; One school in Fermanagh believes cross-border co-operation could be the key to its survival.
&gt; 
&gt; St Mary's High School, Brollagh, near Belleek is one of the smallest post-primary schools in Northern Ireland with just 132 pupils.
&gt; 
&gt; A consultation is due to begin on Monday over plans to close it. The local community is campaigning to keep the school open.
&gt; 
&gt; School principal Michael Burns believes a cross-border partnership could secure its future. 

**Business**
------------------------------
&gt; we are competing for investment (at a handicap) with the Republic.

That isn't the whole picture, ""competing for investment"" is one aspect of the Economy, and essentially means a race to the bottom in competition for low wage jobs by lowering Corporation Tax but an obvious solution is a [harmonised tax](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/business/opinion/business-view-we-should-copy-republics-budget-boost-30664880.html) throughout the Island.

&gt; That the south has had to get even more creative with its tax offering has led commentators to point out that Northern Ireland needs to be doing the same.

The greatest strength of the peace process has been cross border co-operation between businesses. It is undoubtably greatest success story, every effort has been to minimise the effect of the border.

&gt; There is now general agreement that inter-firm cooperation through networks, partnerships and supply-chains can, by facilitating knowledge exchange and reducing
&gt; transaction costs, contribute both to innovation and company competitiveness (Oerlemans et al, 1998). Dense patterns of “association’, alongside links between firms and other support institutions, have also been linked to cluster and regional growth(Cooke and Morgan, 1998). Case-studies of areas with high levels of such inter-organisational cooperation have generally also been characterised by social and economic uniformity, geographical contiguity, high levels of social capital (including, in particular, trust), and stable and supportive governance and support institutions (Braczyk et al., 1998). **Border regions are often characterised by exactly the opposite conditions: economic discontinuity, low levels of social capital, and governance which is at best divided, and at worst, antagonistic (Mitko et al., 2003). The result can be both a lack of knowledge sharing, diffusion and organisational learning (Petrakos and Tsiapa, 2001), and disproportionately low levels of trade. In this context, cross-border cooperation can play an important role, countering the structural discontinuity of border regions and generating a potentially positive growth dynamic**. ^[Source](http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforInternationalBordersResearch/Publications/WorkingPapers/MappingFrontiersworkingpapers/Filetoupload,175403,en.pdf)


**Tourism**
------------------------------
It doesn't take genius to figure out why Tourism in NI suffers, in a fairly disingenous piece of reporting the Belfast Telegraph reported heavily on supposed [frictions](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/all-ireland-tourism-bosses-are-giving-greater-exposure-to-galway-bay-and-not-giants-causeway-30542848.html) within all island tourism from the outgoing executive Alan Clarke and paid little if any attention to the upcoming cuts to the tourist sector he warned of, they where buried deep within the article, The Headline ran with the all too obvious North/South division rather than the [real threat](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/blow-for-northern-irelands-big-events-as-tourism-fund-cut-30637017.html) looming over the Tourism Industry, which was of course an internal sabotage in the form of cuts.

&gt; ""The big danger in terms of public sector cuts is that there will be, I guess, a desire from some people to say, 'Well tourism, you can just cut that budget for a couple of years',"" he said.
&gt; 
&gt; ""But if you cut it for a couple of years, you can't just turn it on again. You have to invest consistently to get that return on all the capital investment that has gone in over the last number of years.""

The truth of the matter is that Tourism Ireland plays a key role in [Marketing Northern Ireland](http://www.tourismireland.com/Home/Our_Marketing_Overseas.aspx) and it is a key area of interest for the southern Government, who in the last few days announced a [€500 million boost](http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/business/dublin-announces-500m-boost-for-border-counties-1-6357502) for tourism for the Border Counties.

&gt;  “The government attaches a high priority to these cross-border programmes, and I am pleased to say that draft programmes have now been submitted to the commission by the government in partnership with the Northern Ireland Executive.”


Now is not the time for insulation but greater cooperation with the south with regards to tourism.

&gt; The figures bear out this importance. In 2006 tourism generated over €4 billion in revenue and employed over 250,000 people North and South. Numbers of tourists visiting the island are also on the increase to 8.8 million in 2006, an 8% increase on 2005 figures*. This equates to over four times as many tourists visiting the island in 2005 compared to 1980. The North’s share of these figures has been steadily rising from 15% in 2001 to 21% in 2005. Despite these figures there is room for improvement.There are new challenges to contend with such as shorter lengths of stay, tougher international competition and pressures on the island’s relative competitive positioning
&gt; Northern Ireland’s share of tourists may have increased but there remains a belief that the industry has room for further growth and income generation. ^[Source](http://www.crossborder.ie/wp-content/uploads/BI-01842.pdf)

This always bothers me. I'm not really certain about this, but don't most governments get thrown out of office when things get bad? It's probably not unique to the Labour party.

I'm left wing on almost all social issues.

I think the government has a responsibility to ensure a decent standard of living for all citizens, because this is something (I don't think) an unregulated capitalist system can provide. Governments should regulate markets in the sense that they should force companies to comply with safety, environmental, and employment legislation. 

Government should also supply basic needs, such as housing, healthcare, and education. They should also enforce a progressive tax system, which taxes higher income earners.

I normally vote Labour or Green!

Leeds is pretty good, know a few people that went there and they seem to like it. One of my friends went there for phD and enjoys it so much more than his undergrad it seems so there's that. Though I know nothing about graphics.

Just look up league tables like times/guardian/complete university guide etc they should be pretty similar if you're looking at UK rankings.

I'm not sure about it being the Russell Group per se but I'd say that it is true that course difficulty does vary from uni to uni. I can't give you any hard evidence to support it but I have lots of anecdotal evidence. A result/indicator of this is what universities companies hire from.

That being said, if you get the grades for your course and work when you're there, then I'd expect a 2:1 to be achievable. As for finding a placement, I imagine that graphics is off your own back more than is based on institution/grade.

false,PhillipPriddy,eccleston,Eccleston,"This episode was the best so far, for me because of a few things

1) The Aesthetic- Capaldi's Doctor seems to breed Analog, with Cyber, and it looks AMAZING! I loved how this episode looked, felt, and just sounded. It was like watching Doctor Who going to Rapture. Everything, from Capaldi's TARDIS, to the Train's blend of High-Tech services, like the ""AI"" Gus (dunno if it's actually an AI, or someone on a speaker) and the small slideshow monitors on the doors' keypad was just right. Hell, even the timer before each death fit beautifully, didn't obscure everything,and made the mood that much more dire, by having a constant countdown.

2) Capaldi- He's getting better and better. The creepy eyes and smile when he says ""Nosey Parker"" and that nonchalant attitude of ""Keep going, can't mourn now, gotta finish what we're doing"" is BRILLIANT. In a way, this season seems to be their way of answering ""Am I a Good Man?"" My answer? No, but he tries to be, because he WANTS to be a good man. Plus, how easily they're slipping small references in, and allowing us to be like ""Did he just...omg he did"" instead of ""Yes, we get it, Tom Baker was a Doctor too, that's nice..."" The references he makes are small, and, unless you know what to look for, well hidden enough to be a treat for people who know them.

3) Danny- This may sound weird, but Danny's attitude of ""Cautiously Interested"" is just great. He cares, he's there, and he's listening, but does wish she'd move on.

There are a few famous pubs outside the ground that will be packed but you'll get the kinda pre game atmosphere that you probably want. The queens on green street is an old style pub and on match day is always rammed. The basement bar feels like something out of an air raid, so if thats your thing go there. There is a pub on the corner of green street where the ground is called, the Boleyn this is a big old victorian pub that is decked out in claret and blue. It is also packed pre game and is a good atmosphere, lots of singing and lots of drinking. Don't think however that there is a problem with the jukebox if you hear Spandau Ballet gold 5 times in a row, its just because they sing 'Always believe in... Carlton Cole' to the tune which is an awesome song that you should sing along with. 

Beer is not allowed on the stands no but can be drank where it is served. There are tv's in all the stands now so if you want to watch from there with a beer go for it, but I'm sure wanna get the atmosphere of the real game so, drink quick and go onto the stand.

The big song you really need to learn to go to a west ham game is 'Im forever blowing bubbles', its the club song  and is sung along before the game starts both halves.

Fabregas was deemed as a failure in Barcelona and he did score more goals and had more assist than him when he was at Barca. Please, don't tell me Iniesta does other things in the field.

1) You'll want to head to a pub a few hours before the match.  That being a home match, you'll have more than a few in walking distance of Upton Park right there on Green Street.

2) I can't comment; haven't been across the pond for a match yet.

3) Alcohol is not allowed anywhere within view of the playing field.  It's an old rule from when hooliganism was a major problem, but it's still in place.  Couldn't tell you what they sell there.

4)  There are a number of chants that we have.  The most famous is on the side of our subreddit in its entirety (""I'm forever blowing bubbles..."").  There are a few other common ones, but knowing that one will get you far.  No need to wear any specific colors or anything -- again, hooliganism is essentially dead, and East London != Compton -- but West Ham's colors are claret and blue, so if you're trying to blend in, find a wine colored shirt. 

Bonus: ""Go Hammers,"" while getting the point across, will draw an amused look or two, I'd wager.

Don't ever let them push you into going self employed. This will make it much harder to sign on again when that  dream job turns out to be a scam/pyramid scheme.

Don't ever tell them you have been offered a job until you have actually been in the job for at least a week. If the job somehow goes to someone else, some cunt of an advisor might take this as you turning down work. Just tell them you haven't heard anything yet but you will ring back a week after the closing date of the job ad to see what happened.

Have them send or print you a letter for all appointments. Use Google calendar to send yourself alerts to remind you a couple of days in advance.

Do not let them have access to your account on the government research website. Most of the jobs on there are crap, and not applying for enough jobs on there could get you sanctioned.

I think this is a very unfair comment because it depends partly on what you value. Yes economy is doing well when the Tories left in 1997, but schools, hospitals and general facilities not so good. Labour initiates one of the biggest school rebuilding programs ever seen and facilities improve dramatically - proves a cost on the economy but the people enjoy new facilities and better quality of living and provision. On the same note Labour introduces the minimum wage, Conservatives said this would increase unemployment and the result is it proves negligible.

To me, the deficit is not a massive problem, and is not 'rightfully' the big issue - what is a massive problem is that people are still starving, house prices are increasing dramatically and wages are being driven down whilst the gap between the rich and poor expands exponentially. Minimum wage should be at least upwards of £8 - especially in London. When 'work doesn't pay' and a high percentage of people are working but on benefits or poor, the 'deficit' should be the last concern.

I think you've already answered your own question by commenting that the parents weren't interested in what their children are up to. I can imagine it would be difficult growing up in an environment without stability and deference from your parents. The home environment may not be one they particularly enjoy being in, leading them to be out in the city with little to do. I can imagine if my parents were so unconerned with me that my being dragged home by the Police didn't even bother them it would play havoc with my sense of self-worth. It's unfortunate that the personal problems of some parents can affect the way their raise their children, but the answer is to help people, not to punish them. 

Combine this with the fact that at the of 14/15 people tend to be at their least responsible, being at a formative point in their lives when they want to push the limits of the rules around them and work out how the world works. Just because someone engages in activity like that which you've unfortunately had a problem with at that age, doesn't mean they will do it throughout their whole life. There are plenty of people I know now that are intelligent, happy adults that were absolute shits when they were about that age! Calling people scum is hardly helping - how would you feel if someone referred to as 'scum', even if they thought it was justified?

You're title claims ""anti-social behaviour is plaguing the UK"", and then you go on to talk about some personal experiences you have had: hardly evidence of a nationwide plague! I'm sorry to hear that you've had abuse from people, nobody should have to deal with that. But how many individuals have you actually had trouble with?

false,grollcool,null,null,"&gt; I feel like you still think Barcelona are the premier force in Europe

Barcelona are one of the best teams in the world. Do you disagree? I think most avid footballing fans all agree that while Barcelona haven't been winning the CL recently they are still easily one of the top teams in Europe. Not believing that is incredibly short-sighted.

&gt; Hate to burst your bubble but Barca really aren't that untouchable anymore

I never said they were. I really don't get where you are getting this from.

&gt; Messi, Neymar, Suarez are much greater match winners right now than Iniesta

Messi is obviously, but Neymar isn't more integral to the Barcelona team than Iniesta is, and that is a fact. Barcelona can win trophies without Neymar, without Iniesta its a whole other story. Nobody defines Barcelona like Xavi, Iniesta, Messi, and Busquets. Those players are pretty much what makes Barcelona the way they are right now. And Suarez hasn't even played a second of competitive football for Barca so trying to argue whether he is more important to Barcelona than Iniesta is absolutely ridiculous.

&gt; Find me a win last season that Iniesta has been the biggest factor in and I'll find you 3 that each of those players have

Iniesta *is* always a big factor when Barcelona wins, but it tends to be hard to be the *biggest* when you have the best player in the planet in your team scoring nearly every single game. 

Are you saying that because Adam Lallana had more MotM's for Southampton that he is better than Iniesta? And because him and Charlie Adam have more goals and assists they are the better players?

So my theory is it all comes down to economics, Stoke has seen a huge rise in unemployment while London has not suffered as badly. People in Stoke see their neighbourhoods changing (it literally has become a shithole in the past 15 years) and also feel their livelihoods threatened, whereas people in London probably don't feel the same level of threat. 

And this is where the disconnect between the voter and the main parties have come in, people in Stoke don't seem themselves as racist, they integrate well with the established Asian community, they're just worried about jobs and their future. Telling them they're just being racist without addressing the issues just drives them into the arms of the parties who are, back then it was the BNP, now it's UKIP.

I understand you may have unwittingly worded it poorly but you have to consider being on a US-centric website a lot of UK folk are a bit tired of that sort of remark and it definitely gets peoples' backs up. Others have mentioned it too so I can probably assume you've realised why the initial reception was a bit chilly. Let's move on.

I'll respond to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/2jdd5p/citizen_by_descent_considering_moving_to_the_uk/clann78) post and others here too for the sake of not cluttering the thread up with bit-part responses.

|Like, my bro lives in Birmingham and he just gets drunk at the pub and watches villa and says super sexist things.

Maybe your bro is just some guy who's a bit ignorant / old fashioned (I'm assuming he's not being malicious with these remarks, just one of those.. well, ""lad"" types) and likes his football and a quiet uneventful life? There are people like that everywhere, all over the world and most definitely in the USA. Even in Oregon.

&gt;I know there's lots of sexism, homophobia, racism, christianity

Maybe, but less than you'd think. In day to day life here you'll rarely meet anyone who takes issue with what you do in your personal life or with your personal parts here, so if you're looking for a ""safe"" place to be gay, bi, pansexual or the plethora of different ways to identify and express yourself, you'll get along just fine pretty much anywhere. Especially traditional university towns. As for Christianity, the UK is probably one of the *least* known for that.

Brighton is the UK's biggest/most famous LGBT community so you'll definitely find a hint of SF about it, places like Bristol and aforementioned well known Uni towns will also have thriving communities for students &amp; young people in general and the arts, music, craft &amp; communities that go with said demographic. Christ even my fairly plain home city of Nottingham has plenty going on and more within easy reach. The biggest cities, obviously, will always have more places, people and things that cater to you. London (obviously, it's huge) would need a whole separate post to get into but you'd most definitely find plenty to match your interests there.

As you mentioned a specific subject you'd be looking at getting into, your best bet would be to research and consider what universities are rated the highest in it, if you're coming all the way over to study it'd be daft to go short change yourself on education. Someone who's studied a similar field would probably be able to help you out more on which is the best but the UK uni's are ranked damn highly on the whole, some of the best and most prestigious in many subjects. Of course, depends on the uni and the subject, so research it well. A generally poor rated Uni can sometimes surprisingly have a fantastic department in one specific thing, and vice versa.  But anywhere there's a decent sized university there will be a community and social life that suits your tastes not far away.

Basically, you'd find things you're looking for, if you look, in most places. It might be a little different to what you're used to but it's there nonetheless. We don't really have an equivalent of the bible belt where there's absolutely nothing happening ever for people who have interests and lifestyles outside the mainstream, and so long as you're a decent person and nice to be around you certainly won't find yourself ostracised or alienated from general society for your choices, identity and beliefs.

My point isn't that Barca are a bad team, nor that Iniesta is a bad player. This whole time I have been saying that Iniesta had a comparatively poor season last season compared to times gone by, and that other players Messi, Ronaldo, Costa, Suarez, Bale et. al had much better seasons than him. *Whether or not* you still believe he is a great player, that is undeniable. In my opinion, Hazard's achievements taking into account the difficulty of the EPL and the lack of striker were more impressive than Iniesta's achievements in a receding Barca side who got overtaken my comparative minnows. That's my opinion. Disagree freely. 

PS. I watch Barca play in big games, I am a neutral, I observed that Barca was comparatively poor last season, I don't care if you watch them play against the minnows of La Liga. I don't care if Iniesta is outstanding against teams like Almeria. The best players show their best on the biggest stage. Iniesta did not do that last season

If he is no longer in a position where he is in an appropriate job (I.e. his authorization has been revoked), it's a breach of the Computer Misuse Act to log into the system (All BT systems warn you of this when you log in). 

Not that I'm going to call the police or anything :P I'm sure loads of people forget or ""forget"" to remove their access to systems all the time.
