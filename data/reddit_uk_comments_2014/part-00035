Time passes and those couples fall apart. They go to a lawyer to begin divorce procedures, but because the state they live in doesn't see them as legally married, they can't gain a legal divorce.

It's unfortunate in many ways, but the financial power employed by City have really relegated us from the traditional big 4 of old.  City and Arsenal are our closest competitors in terms of annual turnover and they are still nearly 40M better off per season than us, added to which Arsenal is sitting on top of a cash pile nearly the same size as every other club in the PL combined.  I guess my point is it's always going to be difficult for us to break back into the top 4 and I think the expectation that we should simply be there all the time should probably be replaced with getting there would be a massive achievement given the gap between us and the other clubs in terms of financial capability.

I mean for the most part that's still whats been happening, most of the cfcuk guys still comment here and still are generally liked.  It's only when the letters C.F.C.U. and K. enter into it that because we now have a negative connotation someone says something negative about us, and that's usually when the circlejerks and long-winded discussions happen because we (I) feel the need to defend our (my) selves .

Kalas can play RB and CB, and was most used at RB last year. Given he hasn't played much at all this year I had him pegged as cover for Ivanovic mainly. So Ivan/Kalas, Azpi/Cole, Terry/Cahill/Ake with Luiz pushing up.

Maybe a direct order from Jose to prepare him more for LB, but I think there are also other explanations.

Plus, in the long-term he's best served playing his strongest position during these formative years isn't he? I'd rather him be at CB/CM because that's his best shot professionally and he has the potential to be great.

also, he was bought for 26m, and he is 28. we have no re-sale value on him. we aren't going to ship him off to spain and make a 15m loss on him, Levy wouldn't allow it. hence why he will be here for a while i reckon. he just needs to get his confidence back, and we need to have a settled system. he is a good striker, he can play with the ball at his feet, we just have to keep going.",0,1391577962,null,0,false,0,cf7fo6f,t3_1x20a1,t1_cf7fo6f,t1_cf7fh8p,null,1432258856,7,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,7

AVB played him whilst stubbornly persisting with inverted wingers, a tactic that narrowed our field of play and stopped sharp service from the wings behind the defensive line... ie. the exact kind of balls that the Valencian Soldado thrived on.

Sherwood comes in and due to a combination of factors (injuries to key wingers, Adebayor coming back into form), doesn't really address the problem.  The team is still not playing in a way to maximise Soldado's abilities.

The thing is, Soldado is a striker of limited qualities.  He is not fast, he is not a dribbler, he is not powerful and strong, he cannot hold the ball up.  Negredo (who was rumoured to be higher on our target priority list, along with Benteke, Villa and more) is better suited to the way AVB and Sherwood have wanted to play, but we missed out on him.  So you can't go and spend 26mil quid on Soldado and expect the weaknesses in his game to disappear because of his price tag.

* IRL, this episode was written before the notion of a War Doctor was created. Moffat wrote this episode with the idea that the Doctor was going to have one more regeneration after Matt Smith.

* In the universe, the Doctor needed to die at Lake Silencio. The Silence knew about the Time Lord's ability to regenerate. The Silence would not know if this was the last time. They needed a full show to be convinced.

* Who was on the Beach instead of the Doctor? The Teselecta, a race of Time Traveling Miniature Humans who go after criminals from different time periods to punish them, lent the Doctor one of their ships. He was inside the suit.

* Why did the Teselecta know to do that? They were in the room with Melody Pond when she transformed into River Song. They assumed this was part of the process. Also, the Doctor was inside the suit directing.

* How would the know how to copy it exactly? They have on staff a woman that prides herself on getting things perfect. She would want it done perfectly.

* Why did the Teselecta allow one of their suits to be used for this ruse? Having the Doctor owe them a favor is probably more valuable than a suit.

* How can the Teselecta fake that kind of energy? The first time we saw them, they faked a motorbike. Why would faking time energy be any more impossible?",0,1391581976,null,0,false,0,cf7h0ns,t3_1x26o9,t1_cf7h0ns,t3_1x26o9,null,1432259490,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

I think most people would be fine with fracking if they actually released all the chemicals they used and not leave a few ingredients out of the mix. 

However the chemicals include:

&gt;Researchers at the University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, Texas evaluated private well water quality in aquifers overlying the Barnett Shale formation. Arsenic, selenium, strontium and total dissolved solids (TDS) levels in some wells within 3km of active wells exceeded EPA MCLs. Levels of arsenic, selenium, strontium, and barium were lower at comparison sites located outside of 3 km from the wells, as well as outside the Barnett Shale region. Methanol and ethanol were found in 29% of samples. Researchers attributed the elevated levels to a variety of factors, including mobilization of natural constituents, the lowering of the water table, and faulty equipment. source http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es4011724

So frankly more people should be against fracking if they're against ground water contamination that will kill the little wild life we have left. It will also disproportionately affect people that rely on well water and nomads that rely on well water.

Dailymotion: Has tons of episodes, crappy quality.

Netflix: Has very few episodes, high quality.

Hulu Plus: Has a very respectable amount of popular episodes in high quality. (I recommend this personally. If you don't already have Hulu Plus, you can sign up for a free week. You still have to sign up via credit card, but you can easily cancel before the week is up.) 

**Option Two: Novels.**

Each Doctor has plenty of novels written for them, and I've started reading them myself. These are the novels reprinted for 9, 10, and 11 celebrating the 50th. 

9) [Only Human](http://www.amazon.com/Doctor-Who-Human-Gareth-Roberts/dp/1849905193/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391591509&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=doctor+who+only+human)

**Option Three: Audio dramas.**

Produced by Big Finish productions, these are audio only adventures that have the classic Doctor Who cast. They release content for the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Doctor. Since the audience is more niche, it can be more mature at times. My most highly recommended story is ""[The Holy Terror](http://www.bigfinish.com/releases/v/the-holy-terror-637)."" It's a deal for $3. Though if you want to try a free one, there's this. Just bear in mind this particular story is ""calmer"" than most. The entire episode consists of phone calls. I personally like it a lot though.

I sometimes feel the same way and my heart literally skips a beat every time somebody in our defense misplaces a pass or makes a mistake, because I'm thinking that we're going to concede every time it happens and get badly beaten.

Also, if you want a more tactical explanation it's because our players are projecting their nervousness on to you, because they themselves don't feel quite comfortable just passing the ball in between the centerbacks or back to the keeper. So it results in many many nervous moments and various mistakes, because we don't exactly pass it like Swansea used to do (with confidence and style).

Imagine Jermain Defoe on form but with the creativity and passing ability of say Lewis Holtby. 

The downsides are that he's no threat in the air, and may not be strong enough yet to stand toe to toe with premier league CB's

43 POLICE FORCES THROUGHOUT THE UK HAD OFFICERS FACING DISHONESTY CHARGES AND CORRUPTION - as stated in a 'TIMES SURVEY ' and the Home Secretary at the time - Jack Straw - said this alarming situation of crooked police posed a great risk to justice.  Many of the charges concerned drugs, misuse of police information, perverting the course of justice and assaults.  The survey revealed that it just didn't occur at constable level with a few sergeants, it also mentioned superintendents, chief inspectors and high ranking detectives.  In the light of this they said a new unit was to be formed called CIB3, and that would be assigned to root out corruption.  Ten years on -- and there has been no significant cases as a result of these findings 

SUSSEX CELL DEATHS NEED INQUIRY -- Disciplinary action was taken against three employees of The Sussex Police in the 'Reynolds Incident' which has triggered the reaction of some MP's who called for an inquiry in 2010 citing two other deaths - Brighton 2005 and the Crawley incident in 2007.

'THE DEATH OF LEON PATTERSON IN CUSTODY' -- He was found lying naked and in handcuffs on the cell floor at The Stockport Police Station. Deborah Coles of INQUEST said ' At an earlier hearing, a verdict of unlawful killing was made -- but on appeal after disagreement between medical opinions, it had been changed to a verdict of 'misadventure' which was a damning indictment of his treatment -- the attitude of the police and police doctors was one of callous indifference and appalling neglect'   (Patterson suffered heavy bruising in police hands)

'THE DEATH OF BRIAN DOUGLAS IN CUSTODY' -- He was taken after his arrest to Vauxhall Police Station, and was found dead in the cell with a 'fractured skull'.  Medical opinion suggested this was the result of a police baton. The Brixton Community were outraged and called for a public inquiry into his death.

'THE DEATH OF SHIJI LAPITE IN CUSTODY'  -- The death occurred while he was held at Stoke Newington Police Station. At the inquest Robert Howes in giving evidence, said 'there were terrible screams like someone being hurt'  It was further disclosed that officers unknown? had kicked him about the head -- Counsel for the victim and deceased said one of the assisting police officers, Constable Jonathan Ridley was lying to assist his brother officers.

' THE DEATH OF JAMIE STEWART IN CUSTODY' -- Incarcerated at Holloway Police Station, -- this incident caused people to look into the behaviour of the police, and officers at the station came quickly under suspicion.... as the medical examination of the deceased found that his tongue was cut and that no other bruises were found?  But it emerged later that there had been a violent struggle in the cell with several officers before his death. Another young man in a different cell said he could hear the banging about and crashes along with cops swearing and telling others to 'give him it' --- That young man lodged a complaint on his release. It also emerged that Jamie was handcuffed when they threw him into the cell -- and the young man said ' they went in mob-handed to teach him a lesson'

'THE DEATH OF JOSHUA WARD IN CUSTODY' -- This young man was arrested and taken to Whetstone Police Station. The medical examiner said that he died from a 'fractured skull' --- This incident might have been accepted it were not for one person, -- his father was Detective Constable Jon Ward, who was very unhappy with this explanation...he had visited his son after the arrest and talked to him in the custody cell, and was perfectly convinced that Joshua was lively and healthy --- he said 'there is an answer and I am going to get it whatever it takes to find it'

CUSTODY DEATHS TOO STRANGE TO IGNORE -- A call for a Commission with far-reaching powers followed after several similar cases and the fact that 75 black men had died in police cells....the final prod to get one going arrived when teenager Philip Knight 15, and 23 yr old Garry Grace met their deaths in police cells....and the list unhappily goes on.

DEATHS IN CUSTODY ARE SAID TO BE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL FOR EIGHT YEARS -- A new report (2012) has indicated that 230 people have died in cells  (prison too) making a fifteen percent rise. Last year alone their were 229 investigations carried out by the PPO.

**Buying players is not like buying a candy bar at the vending machine.**

It involves negotiations, hassling, legal officialties, all sorts of things. It is not a one-sided operation, where the price is tagged nicely and you just go and pay the money. 

**Information on transfers is always political.**

 Selling parties always have the incentive to 'leak' early interest, especially if the price is on the low side, in order to entice more potential buyers. The potential of a bidding war almost always benefits selling clubs and especially agents. When agents manage to secure a bigger contract, it inadvertently results in higher signing fees for the player individually, as well as higher wages, which is why the player allows it. 

In the case of Salah, Basel had no loss in concluding the deal at the end of January. What were they going to lose, Liverpool walking away? Additionally, all Chelsea needed to do was make a phonecall to Salah's agent saying ""We'll buy your kid for 30% more than Liverpool if we sell Mata. All deals are off if any part of this makes the press before we sell Mata."" and he would have kept his mouth shut. 

**Forcing the selling club to conclude the deal early doesn't make you a good negotiator, it makes you a good blackmailer.**

A negotiator who can make an unwilling party sell against their intentions is a fantasy. Such things happen, but seldom because of the negotiator. Usually, it's due to money. Or compromising pictures. 

**Release clauses are seldom worth the paper they are printed on.**

Outside of Germany and Spain, release clauses are included to make players happy and bait offers. In many countries, including England, release clauses are fulfilled more out of a sense of courtesy than anything else. 

**Comparing Sturridge and Coutinho with Konoplyanka and Salah is inane.**

Both Sturridge and Coutinho were players out of favour at their clubs when Liverpool came knocking. These were players that their holding clubs did not consider vital to their remaining campaign at January. Konoplyanka is arguable **THE** star player for Dnipro, and Salah had garnered enough attention as an upcoming star after his performances against Chelsea and Spurs in Europe. These were players whose value was unlikely to drop after 6 months. They had every right to hold out for a price that was satisfactory to them. Note here that this 'satisfactory price' is not a price set in stone. Salah's might have been 11 million at the beginning of January, but it easily became 11 million plus addons with Chelsea's involvement. Imagine if Real Madrid came into the fray, or Bayern Munich. The price would surely have had skyrocketed. A bidding war is exactly what happened in summer with Willian. 

So considering unavailability during January, increased prices as compensation for losing an important player for half the campaign, and the possibility of bidding wars, I don't know why Liverpool fans are so upset. Of the 3 teams above Liverpool, only Chelsea really upgraded with the purchase of Matic and maybe Salah, deals that were basically funded by the sale of Mata. Arsenal had Kallstrom in on loan, and City did not buy anybody. Of the 3 teams beneath Liverpool, only Everton had any significant investment. Considering the fact that Martinez is a new manager who needs to build his team, and also the fact that Everton are currently running on net profits from transfers due to the sale (more like scam) of Fellaini, it was always going to be expected. Spurs bought no one, and United bought Mata, a funny deal considering an attacking midfielder is probably the least of their worries. Liverpool are currently in the red by more than 20 million pounds. The idea that the manager can continue to 'squander' money on future investments like Ilori and Luis Alberto without any sort of impact in the near future, and buy someone like Aspas who has made next to no positive impact to the team, without consequences is ridiculous. So many Liverpool fans seem to react in such a way that they seem to expect the club to spend like City, Chelsea, Monaco and PSG, all the while lambasting those clubs for buying glory.

This one, for example, starts with a ""Of course the recession should not be compared to the second world war"", then adds a 'but', and proceeds to do exactly that. It also glosses over our debt doubling in recent years, and adds no opinions from experts who disagree, only those who do (several of whom make exactly the same leap mentioned above of assuming our economy of 1910 looked and worked anything like it does now). And most (if not all) of the quotes are from 2010, when (no doubt the same) experts were insisting that austerity wouldn't lead to a recovery *at all*.

Alternatively, consider this - if a ceiling is artificial, why haven't we been pushing it all the time instead of only after a world war? Why hasn't it been consistently pushed or ignored? Have all the other experts simply been wrong and we've had a cash-cow we could have been using instead of PFI?

It's such an absurd argument that it hardly even merits a response beyond derisive laughter.  I spend inordinate amounts of time trying to live ethically, and it's frankly impossible to do so consistently under capitalism.  Most large companies greenwash themselves these days, and some even make a stab at redwashing, their advertising is unsurprisingly deceptive, but their statements and policies often are too, even when made to regulators and government, and even when believed by their own staff; their ownership networks are complex beyond belief, often deliberately so, and a vast amount of the 'choice' on offer is actually delusory, with all the brands being owned by two or three major conglomerates which are all sourcing their products from the same list of factories.  Trying to source goods and services without the taint of capitalism, or even which don't exhibit th worst excesses of it, whilst living under it is a full time job - and, as one of the panellists mentioned on the night, does it make sense to criticise the death row prisoner for tucking into their last meal?

In the specific instance of the Starbucks queue at Occupy, it's worth noting that the majority of those queuing were queuing to use the loos before the site got properly established and sanitised, which may speak more to the lack of public toilet facilities in the city than to any love of corporate coffee.  But boycotting individual companies is really only relevant when particular anti-capitalists make personal judgement calls about certain companies being beyond the pale (as I have with many large well-known corporations, but by no means all), or where a specific campaign is ongoing to attempt to exert pressure on a Board/shareholders of a particular company to change a particular practice, policy, etc.",0,1391595643,null,0,false,0,cf7jukb,t3_1x01by,t1_cf7jukb,t1_cf7j7ps,null,1432260881,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

Madrid/Granada/Sevilla - might be pushing it to do all three, and it will likely be very hot (38-40C-ish).  But pick one and it could be within budget.  Granada is my favourite, the Alhambra is incredible and the tapas awesome.

Fly to Pisa (cheap), then you can get the train to Florence and/or Cinque Terre (google if you haven't heard of it).  All quite touristy and busy, but with very good reason and not ""resorty"".

Budapest - Beautiful city, fantastic nightlife, friendly locals, amazing public baths.

true,_SHOULD_BE_WORKING_,uk,Norwich,"&gt; So here am I, walking home after a few pints at the local and I'm stopped by a copper. He asks me for a sample of breath. The correct response is to tell them to mind their own fucking business but I suspect you'd open wide and let them slip it in there.

Actually in Norwich they were doing this recently to raise awareness of how intoxicated revellers were. A tactic I found a bit odd. Why would you want to show a person how drunk they are when they have gone on a night out with the sole intention of getting drunk?

&gt; There's no way I live in a country where people are that subservient that they think a copper is allowed to randomly breathalyse you and arrest you if you refuse.

I disagree. Used correctly it gives the police the power they need to prosecute drink drivers. It's not ideal to have 'nothing to hide, nothing to fear' legislation, but it's legislation that will save lives. 

If I found myself in the same situation as the journalist I would have been demanding to be breathalysed so I could prove my innocence.

Whilst I'm no expert, I myself went from a vanquis (no credit history at all) to a 3k balance transfer on 0% and had no issues with it.

If your credit file is OK. I.e. no late payments, history of managing credit, and your debt isn't too bad (3k isn't huge) then if your total available credit (vanquis limit + new balance transfer) doesn't make up too much of your income, then you should be golden.

You should also have a look at noddle for a free credit report. It's only callcredit (so not the other two) but for me it shows all my credit commitments, payment history etc. it should give you a wider understanding of your credit report too.

Thatcher bet everything on financial services and what a crock of shit that turned out to be.

In doing so she ignored or actively damaged manufacturing industry so she could undermine the unions.

Her heirs then took their chance to sell out UK every job they could to China, India or whatever other modern day slave plantation was prepared to offer the rankest conditions and the meanest wages on the planet.

The smokescreen for this was encouraging ever high levels of debt, ever bigger housing bubbles, more and more propaganda about ""free market economics"" or ""trickle down tax cuts"".

There isn't an employer in the country who doesn't think ""how can I send this job to China? How can I make it minimum wage? How can I make it zero hour?

A fair days work for a fair days pay does not even enter into their thinking.

The media plays along: Fifty Romanians coming to work in the UK is a scandal. Fifty thousand British jobs shipped off to call centers in India is fine if it helps shareholder dividends.

Now look where we are.

Spivs in charge of Britain's biggest business - financial services.

Spivs who see billion dollar fines as a cost of doing business to be paid out of the bonus pool in five years time when they are long gone. Spivs who lie, cheat and manipulate every market they can to con even the poorest out of their savings.

More old Etonians in cabinet than ever in the past. All of them intellectual and moral midgets. All of them beholden to the whoever is shoveling them the most in donations or backhanders. They even make Thatcher look good in comparison.

Is it any wonder the UK is falling behind?

No - the only surprise is that decades of neo-conservative, Tory policies haven't completely impoverished 99% of the country, while the 1% get more wealth than any person can ever spend in a lifetime - tax free for them of course.

But where we are going at an every faster rate is the bottom of the table if we don't get rid of these lunatics in power now.

true,HedonisticVibrations,null,null,"I thought we did really well out of the transfer window. 

**IN**: Pelly Ruddock, Fraser Franks (Both Permanent), Cameron McGeehan, Jernade Meade, Ryan Inniss, Kane Ferdinand (All Loans)

Bringing Pelly Ruddock back permanently is obviously the headline grabber, absolute cut above in the games he played on loan for us earlier in the season, if he maintains that performance then I think we will have one of the best midfield units in the league, with Lawless and Guttridge complimenting him so well. 

Fraser Franks is from what i can make out a highly regarded centre half and the fact we picked him up so cheap, activating the clause in his contract makes it a bit of a bargain too.  

Both McGeehan and Inniss have played well from what I have seen, especially McGeehan who was outstanding in tricky conditions against Nuneaton. Havent seen Meade play yet so cant comment but nice to have a local lad in the squad. Ferdinand I am really not sure about at all, some flashes from him but to me he seems like the type of guy you dont want around your squad, very petulant in the games I have seen especially in the Trophy game at Cambridge. Dont think he is needed anymore with the other midfield additions. 

**OUT**: Scott Rendell, Arnaud Mendy, Shaun Whalley (Loan), Solomon Taiwo (Loan), Alex Wall (Loan), JJ O'Donnell (Loan)

Two big wages off the books in Rendell and Mendy which is good and players going out on loan to either gain experience or match sharpness. Bit surprised Whalley went to a Conf North side but to be quite honest he has been a shadow of a player he was in pre season. Think that penalty miss on the opening day against his former club destroyed his confidence and he has never regained it, a shame as he looked so good in pre season. The loan of Wall has paid off already, helping Dartford get a point off Cambridge. 

Think Cambridge have had a poor window which also helped us. Failed to get their key loan players of Maxwell and Appiah back and the players they got to replace them have seemed poor, the GK from Portsmouth Sullivan coming in for particular criticism. Replacing a player like Appiah with Barnes-Homer, well im pretty pleased with that also. Dont think their style suits him at all. Having said that Ashley Chambers is a dangerous player and a good signing for them. 

So on the whole pretty pleased with the last months activities, got some good players in, and the players who went where either deadwood or needed to get game time under their belts. Never felt it was on the cards but keeping Andre Gray was huge also. 

Long way to go, but hopefully these moves will strengthen us further for the run in.

  You seem to have this wonderful magical notion that a contract trumps everything else.  If I made a contract with you to sell you guns would that trump the laws prohibiting gun sales? No, it wouldn't!  Similarly, in order that TFLs business is valid they have to meet their responsibility under law, which they are not.  What if they deemed that black people have to sit at the back of the bus?  Is that OK because you haven't made a contract with them yet? No! Stop being so stupid!  You need to engage that thing between your ears before you comment.
 
  The **fact** (I'm seemingly the only one here who cares about such things) remains that there is a legal responsibility for public transportation to meet the needs of the residents, this includes listening when 2 thirds of those surveyed oppose a proposed change to accepting legal tender.

 I have posted actual laws backing up my position, you have posted nothing but conjecture, you are the delusional one here.  Or perhaps you just don't like to admit when you are wrong?

Edit: To clarify, you say TFL have no responsibility before you buy a ticket. This is factually wrong. They DO have a legal responsibility to the public, they get their mandate to operate through meeting these responsibilities.

true,chamber37,,Joe le Tactics,"Before I get started, I just want to make it clear I'm not criticizing you specifically, or having a go... but I really think this country has a really unhealthy obsession with the supposed relationship between age and expected development levels of young players. 

This idea that people seem to have that players need to be developed by their early twenties is insane. And 24 is hardly prime age. Players continue to develop physically until 25, and most professionals seem to hit their ""prime"" at about 27-29. This is why we have plenty to be enthusiastic about with an average squad age of ~23.

There's also the issue of experience. It's arguably the single most important part of a player's development (part of the reason the NextGen series was created; and a massive part of why I'm pissed about UEFA hijacking it). When we consider Albrighton's limited experience to this point -- he still has less than 100 senior appearances in all competitions over six seasons; through a combination of injury and questionable team selections -- it's not unreasonable to think he could still improve a considerable amount over the next few years, given enough opportunity. Of course, he'll need to earn that, but I think he can do so. What he lacks in finishing compared to Weimann, he more than makes up for with creation, imo.

As a point of comparison in terms of experience, btw, Leandro Bacuna is two years younger and has about a season's worth of games (about 30) more experience than Super Marc. Yet I would argue there's not much between them in terms of current ability.

Look at Gareth Barry and Lee Hendrie. Two players who came through the same system, with similar quality players. One hit his best playing days at about 27-28, the other at about 22-23. Michu was 25-26 and a veteran of almost 250 appearances before he had his first really good season, for example.

Financial services pay a shitload of money to this country. Paid for the education you got for free, the NHS you've used your whole life. In what planet do you think the UK was ever going to compete with the developing world in the manufacture of cheap good or things like coal mining? Those industries were dying long before Maggie killed them off.

Internationally the UK still compares VERY well in almost every criteria of living quality.

&gt;There isn't an employer in the country who doesn't think ""how can I send this job to China? How can I make it minimum wage? How can I make it zero hour?

Utter bollocks. Plenty of great small employers out there who value a loyal workforce.

&gt;The media plays along: Fifty Romanians coming to work in the UK is a scandal. Fifty thousand British jobs shipped off to call centers in India is fine if it helps shareholder dividends.

Again, in what world do you expect the UK to be able to compete against India for cheap call centre workers? We can't. It's just not our game to play, and if we did somehow force businesses to keep those jobs here, we'd be bitching even more about rising costs. Like it or not, it's an international world so we are forced to compete against those countries whether we like it or not. A shift towards a service based economy was inevitable.

Also, failed to mention:

&gt;Hawksworth said the UK was now likely to start moving back up the table after better economic news in 2014.

So it's just another day at the guardian. A misleading headline, pessimistic about the UK, blame the tories (even though the article says the problem is due to the 2007-08 crash...). Guess I shouldn't expect any better.

Oh, and this doesn't look so bad either. One could almost conclude that Tory economic policy is working, minimised damage and is fixing the economy...

The problem with having yellow-boxed speed cameras on motorways (rather then the cameras positioned in accident-prone sections of A-roads) is that comuters quickly learn where they are, and only slow down for that section of motorway.

The variable speed controls are very effective at controlling conjestion, but only when people follow them. It doesn’t take many people doing 70mph in the outside lane to cause half the motorway to bunch up and slow down to 30.

true,DarkSayed,null,null,"I'm in my early thirties, and don't have much to say about governments prior to Labour's win in 1997. However, in the 13 years that Labour held power, I think they not only made huge mistakes, but also acted in a way that was treacherous. I feel like they essentially sold the country out for votes. They instituted policies which were harmful in the long term, but in the short term brought them popularity. Some examples: Education, public spending &amp; debt, immigration, the City of London, the Iraq war.

Education: In the 80s, the UK had a good education system. A levels were world class and getting three A's was quite an achievement. These days, getting 5 or 6 As at A level is common and its not because pupils are getting smarter. They are, if anything, worse. Employers find they are having trouble with graduates and universities are having to spend more time of the basics that should be known. At some point, we may even have to move to 4 year bachelors degrees to make up for it.
Labour gave the illusion of improvements in educational standards when all they did was make it easier to pass. They *reduced* standards to make themselves look like they were doing the exact opposite.

Public spending and debt. It's easy to make voters happy by throwing around lots of cash. Labour mismanaged the country's finances by excessive borrowing and insane amounts of waste on benefits and failed public-sector projects (the NHS IT projects come to mind). They wanted to make the voters happy by throwing lots of cash at them. But there are consequences to being irresponsible. Labour delayed those consequences by mounting up debt. They could buy votes now, deal with the consequences later. Being responsible can make you unpopular, but sometimes you have to cut back. 

Immigration: I am not against immigration, done properly, it's essential and healthy for the prosperity of the nation. However, Labour did no do this properly. They have themselves now admitted that they massively screwed this up and far more people came in than they said would come in. 

City of London: The over-reliance on the financial services sector, and Labour's close relationships with this industry is much like their attitude on everything else: short term gain to win votes, long term harm to the country. The city contributes a lot in tax. Unfortunately, an industry that produces nothing, take huge gambles with money, and innovates nothing, as well as drawing away human capital from useful, productive industries, is a cancer to a nation's economy, and eventually loses more than it makes. 

Iraq war: a disaster we should never have got involved in. I hope this haunts Tony Blair for the rest of his life.

Of course, a lot of these issues were initiated by preceding Tory governments, and the Tories don't exactly have a great. In general, I don't like the Tories, they are career politicians from a very narrow section of society. I don't agree with them on a lot of things (the HS2 railway, for example). However, there are some glimmers of hope for them:

-They have taken to unpopular but necessary spending cuts.
-They recognise the importance of science, technology and innovation to industry. 
-They are reforming education, promoting STEM subjects and opening lots of new research departments and training centres.
-They recognise the importance of infrastructure projects. They sometimes get it wrong (HS2, for example), but at least they see the value in it. 
-They seem prepared to listen when they are pissed off a lot of people (vote on Syria, for example). 

They are far from perfect, but I think they are making moves in the right direction.

""Bollocks! Fiat currency is legal tender if you offer to pay with cash and the driver refuses to accept it, I suggest you sit down and wait for him to drive. If he calls the police, advise them that you offered legal tender to cover the financial obligation.""

-Legal tender is only with regards to payment of debt.

-To get debt you have to have a contract.

-There is no contract between you and TFL.

-So with no debt to pay, what good is legal tender?

Do you understand? What do they need to accept legal tender for? Also the proposal was to accept cash fares, not legal tender, the wording may not mean much to you but it does in the eyes of the legal system.

Also if only ~1% of journeys are paid by cash, then surely they're meeting their mandated responsibility by catering to the other 99%, the majority, unless I somehow don't know maths either.

As well, they are providing their service, and so can dictate how you pay. There is no part of the transport act that says they have to accept cash. The needs of the people is public transport which TFL are providing. You just have to have an Oyster card. What if I needed transport as a resident for free. Do they have to provide that? In your scenario they would have to. But again, payment and options are not in the act.

Side-note:

I have posted the actual law many times, saying that legal tender does not need to be accepted. I've mentioned how, and repeated myself many times.

The legal system in the UK has 3 branches, the oldest being common law, the next being judicial law and the youngest being parliamentary law.

&gt; Non-built up (excluding motorways): 52% of the total killed, 32% of total seriously injured, 25% of total with slight injuries

&gt; Built up: 42% of the total killed, 65% of total seriously injured, 70% of total with slight injuries

&gt; Motorways: 6% of the total killed, 3% of total seriously injured, 5% of total with slight injuries. **Fatalities on motorways have decreased by 9% since 1994–98 in a period with traffic levels increased by 28%**

(My emphasis). Motorways are relatively safe. It's stop-start traffic in urban areas where most minor accidents occur, and winding A and B roads with sharp corners where you get the most fatalities.

If safety is the primary concern, then actions could include:

* reducing speed limits on winding roads to 50 instead of 60

* putting up signs announcing ""5 casualites on this road in the last 3 years. Slow down. Don't be the 6th"", ""Accdient blackspot"" or even just ""Kill your speed, not yourself""

* Empowering landlords and bar managers to do more to stop people driving if they've had too much to drink - maybe even going as far as confiscating keys

* Reducing the drink drive limit and promoting ""free soft drinks for designated drivers"" campaigns.

* Painting ""slow down"" lines on the road that make the surface bumpy on the approach to dangerous corners

* Using variable speed limits on congestion hotspots, with warning signs to give plenty of notice

* Educating about the gap that should be left between your vehicle and the vehicle in front, particularly at high speeds and in adverse weather conditions, and enforcing laws to maintain it. This could be achieved by introducing a ""gap"" camera, painting chevrons on some roads, and creating a TV campaign.",0,1391603613,null,0,false,0,cf7l50d,t3_1x2jwz,t1_cf7l50d,t1_cf7kfhf,null,1432261489,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

Do like kynaston and his books and think he makes a good point, especially the preponderance of those in power. However the % o people in private school has not been static. It was at lower ebbs, certainly at mine in the early 90s and 60s, when you could argue there was more confident in the state sector. Bring that confidence back and watch numbers fall. The big names will always succeed due to their now international brand recognition - British public school holds huge currency abroad.

true,first_time_caller_,eng-middlesex,Middlesex,"So let me get this straight. 

The big picture is that the rich and financial services are getting richer and the poor are getting screwed because of the UK governments since the 70’s. To further compound this, financial institutions (which have been supported by the governments) extend cheap credit to people as governments default thing to do is set low interest rates as to avoid inflation (as rampant inflation is bad), this in turn allows for people to buy assets despite their income is decreasing to add insult to injury the financial services are creating tools so that people lower on the wage scale can borrow more than they should ([case in point](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/pay-two-grand-on-your-credit-card-to-get-a-250k-flat-in-new-docklands-development-scheme-9106071.html)). The increased demand for assets causing an increase in prices and in turn creates a cycle of increased amount of credit available creating a viscous cycle. This increased value of assets causes them to be an attractive commodity so finical institutes begin to invest in them by siphoning money out of the circulation into assets, yet again causing the value of assets to increase. And the problem stems from the fact that this money should be siphoned off into local industry and manufacturing in the UK as loans and bonds however, since the UK government has not invested/protected secondary (manufacturing, industry etc) sectors, it has become an unattractive commodity to invest in. But if it was invested in by the financial institutions, it would put money back into the pockets of the UK “wage slaves” increasing the average wage, potentially allowing them to have lower debts.

Now the boom bust cycles, in each cycle due to accumulated wealth the rich and financial institutions are quite well protected and are tend to be the winners due to their accumulated wealth, the lending of credit to the average Joe and ability to ride out the recessions. Whereas the average working person is not protected due to this continuous cycle of increasing asset value (increased debt) and decreasing wages in addition they cannot ride out the recessions. So with every cycle they become poorer and the rich hold more of “money” (value) at the end of every cycle. In addition to this the government is exacerbating the problem by keeping interest rates low and creating right to buy schemes(which target people lower down with the wage scale) which again only add to this vicious cycle.
(Slight tangent) Would this would lead the UK economy to become weaker in the quaternary and tertiary sectors with respect to the “brain drain” where bright minds leave/do not come to country as prospects are greater/more stable elsewhere ([similar thing happening in US](http://rt.com/op-edge/us-brain-drain-sequestration-739/))? Does this not in turn reduce privately funded manufacturing in the UK, worsening the current problem?

Am I correct in my train of thought? As to me it looks like the UK governments of the past have been aiming at a short financial gain and stats on arbitrary leader boards which has made them blind to their duty to the people and their well being, i mean this is a developed country where people are struggling to put a roofs over their heads. This doesn't me angry it just makes me disappointed in this country. It has become about a group of people at the top who want instant gratification instead of a long term investment in its people.

It is sort of interesting how people diverge on what someone's identity is.

Because even though I was born in Jamaica, and I lived in Canada for 97% of my life, and my dad is from Jamaica, and my mom is from India, and none of my grandparents but one is from China, people still consider me to be Chinese.

Even in China. That's what everyone considers me to be. But why is that? I think it's because of looks. If Scottish people had a distinctive look, and some people from Scotland left, and re-established themselves elsewhere, that group still might be considered Scottish, even if it was generations ago.

&gt;**Bexhill-on-Sea** (often simply **Bexhill**) is a town in the [local government county](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_England) of [East Sussex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Sussex), within the ancient and historic county of Sussex, in the south of England, within the [District of Rother](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rother). It has a population of approximately 40,000. The Anglo-Saxon name for the settlement was Bexelei, from leah—a glade where the [box tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_(tree\)) grows.

So certain behaviours are acceptable only if they are *our* behaviours? Our way or the highway kind of thing? Doesn't that strike you as a tad arrogant? 

While I get where you are coming from, they are in many ways a backwards nation, imposing our will on them, presumably by diplomacy, which really means greasing the right palms, talking to the right people, owing some diplomat a favour in future etc etc is not the way to do it.

Yes, they need education, they need teaching that the world has moved on and they need to move with it ... but bribing them to make an exception in *just* this case is only teaching a lesson that certain nations will pay you to make an exception. It's doesn't encourage change, it teaches them to keep doing what they are doing, and get rewarded for it as a bonus.",0,1391606659,null,0,false,0,cf7ls0w,t3_1x2hv2,t1_cf7ls0w,t1_cf7k0er,null,1432261790,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1
true,theanonymousthing,logo,,"Fantastic news, if this is true our midfield will be one of the strongest in Europe although i hope we haven't burn't any bridges with Porto if we want to come back for Mangala and Porto are a club you generally want good relations with given their track record of producing quality players.

This summer i think we will see  a lot of (for a lack of better words) deadwood gone and Young talent loaned (i.e Lopes)

I know January's just ended but what i would like to see in the summer is the following

**OUT**

- Javi Garcia OR Rodwell
 Now with Fernando we cant keep both, feel bad for rodwell he hasn't had a break with injuries crippling any chance of imposing himself on the sqaud, that being said he's younger and has a lot more raw potential than Javi. Javi has so far been a bit of disaster but his recent form is really starting to get my hopes up so its a tough choice.

- Lescott, done a great job for the club but he's 31 plays a fringe role and is on (i believe) £90,000-£100,000/week wages

- Demichelis, at 32 either he's content with being a fringe player or he leaves, done well to cover so far

- Sinclair, time to accept defeat on this one, hasn't really imposed himself on the baggies either

**Loan**

-Lopes, preferably to a top 4 league ( Spain, Germany England, Italy) or to a big club like Porto

**In**

- Fernando

- Mangala

- Karim Rekik 

.

so we should have a squad that looks like:


**ST**

Jovetic

Aguero

Negredo

Dzeko (if he doesn't push for an exit)

**AM**

Silva

Nasri

Navas

Milner

**CM/CDM**

Yaya 

Fernandinho

Fernando

Javi/Rodwell

**LB/RB**

Zabaleta

Richards

Clichy

Kolarov

**CB**

Kompany

Nastasic

Mangala

Rekik

**GK**

Hart

Pantilimon

They really don't. 

The only way the US caught DPR was because he fucked up and they were able to link his SilkRoad name to several other accounts on the ""normal"" web with which he had posted personal information incriminating himself.

If it were as easy to ""chase you through TOR nodes"" they'd have had him years ago along with every other high profile SilkRoad member. 

Not to mention the legal myriad of trying to prove that an IP address links to an action you carried out is next to impossible. There is not a chance that GCHQ could hold someone accountable based only on TOR activity, there's too many variables and too many questions that can be raised for it to be deemed ""without reasonable doubt.""

If you're talking about DPR, the probability is that 'he' has not been one person, different people have used that handle.  

&gt;but to try claim they'd chase you through TOR is absolutely silly.

'Fraid not, they really do.  If they own the TOR entry and exit nodes they've got you.  If they are examining traffic from your entry point (i.e. have a vague suspicion of who you are) and are able to compare it with the suspect traffic, it's a relatively simple comparison job.  If they've got the legal power to requisition logs from the TOR nodes (depending upon the country - most TOR entry and exit nodes are in America, so natch), they've got you.  

&gt;Not to mention the legal myriad of trying to prove that an IP address links to an action you carried out is next to impossible.

Sure, but they'd be idiots to work like that.  What they'd actually do is lock you up as a suspect, probably under anti-terrorism laws, then use regular interrogation and / or threats to get you to give the encryption keys to your computer.  Once they've got physical access, they've don't need to piss about proving IP addresses, because they'll have a shit load of evidence against you.

If you think TOR is secure, look at the lectures given at Defcon by TOR programmers, look at their documents, *they* say it isn't safe from determined attacks.  Add on a bunch of browser and other application exploits as highlighted by Snowden, and yeah, if they want you they can get you.  It's a case of whether you're the money and time.

Personally, I'd see a case for it being better to be a left footed defender (although I obviously know a left/right together is ideal). 

It seems like there are far more right footed players in football? So, you have attackers wanting to work the ball to their right foot (strongest side) and shoot. If you're left footed and defending an oncoming right footed attacker, they're going to be taking the ball to your strongest side too!

true,OllyFunkster,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"&gt; Lower speeds enable cars to get closer together increasing the number of cars in a certain unit area therefore increasing the number of cars able to pass through a certain point per second.

This is not true. Speed and safe separation distance are linearly related (because the safe distance is based on reaction *time*), so if you reduce speed by half you also reduce the gap by half, and the same number of cars pass that point each second. Thus, throughput is not changed but every individual journey takes twice as long.

However, this fails to take into account the length of each car, as the separation distance is back-of-one-car to front-of-another, whereas the number of cars passing would be counted at e.g. the front of each car. The slower you go, the longer the car is in comparison to the separation distance, which means less percentage of road available to use as separation distance and thus throughput decreases slightly (exponentially in fact as speed is reduced).

The point about braking and waves is of course perfectly correct, but a similar effect could be achieved by doubling the separation distance (why aren't there tailgating cameras?) and keeping the speed the same.

true,TopdeBotton,null,null,"There was a [post-war golden age,](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/1671/1/WRAP_Crafts_CEPR-DP6863%5B1%5D.pdf) where the European countries did very well in terms of economic growth. This lasted from the early 1950s to about 1973 when commodity price spikes and oil crises caused massive inflation, which coupled with the stagnant economic growth gave us ""stagflation"". 

The developed world never really recovered from that period; the coping mechanism, if you like, was [financialisation](http://www.newstatesman.com/business/2013/11/financialisation-everyday-life-must-be-confronted). From the 1970s onwards, everything from healthcare to education to the railways began to be seen as candidates for privatisation and more generally, a culture developed that explicitly encouraged and celebrated greed. 

It was only once this climate was firmly established that the [Big Bang](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6081314.stm), the deregulation of London's financial markets, could take place. From then on, the UK became increasingly dependent on the banking sector for profits, while British industry declined. 

Fast forward two decades and the greatest financial crisis since the Wall Street Crash occurs, [for largely the same reasons.](http://www.euroresidentes.com/empresa_empresas/carta-reina.pdf) The financial sector gets carried away, only this time it's the public's money they're gambling with. 

There's a view that the fundamental cause of the long term malaise in the developed world is [a problem fundamental to capitalism.](http://monthlyreview.org/2007/04/01/the-financialization-of-capitalism) People in the richer countries get accustomed to high incomes and strive to maintain that standard of living. In order to do that, growth had to be sustained, even if it happened in a very risky way - through the growth of the financial sector. John Bellamy Foster argues that governments had to allow this to happen. 

It's not exactly a great time to be living through when your economy is gradually degenerating, but that's essentially what we have. Economies aren't meant to be dependent on financial services for growth. There's not a lot that can be done about it in the short term, but over the longer term, things will change.

I think the government often see it as 2 different approaches - 

1: inform people ahead of time, catch fewer people (even people who are bad drivers) BUT everyone will slow down and it will be safer. Or, 

2: don't inform people, catch more people especially bad drivers, but it won't stop bad drivers being bad drivers at the time, only after the fact when you fine them. It will end up being more dangerous at the time even if bad drivers are taken off the road later.

Only trains to Heathrow and Greenford could leave as their lines weren't blocked.

Until 18:30 trains showed as delayed, then they cancelled trains. They closed off the platforms and the station concourse filled with hundreds, if not thousands, of people. At one point they announced they closed the entrances to the underground due to overcrowding.

When they reopened the Platforms to allow boarding, everyone surged forwards, and people went to get on trains not knowing where they were going.

We got home about an hour and a half late, having found a train stopping at our station.

First seemed good to those who got on the wrong train, they were preparing to organize buses for those who needed to go further than our train was going, but in the end they organised an unscheduled stop on a train just behind which was going on further.

For example, how can you scientifically prove that in fact 40% brought more tax than having 50% tax rate? Have all points been taken into account? Like, what period that particular tax rate was applied, whether it was in recession or not, whether there existed some loopholes which don't exist now etc etc.

true,[deleted],null,null,"There are a few school systems in the UK. All school years run September-July(ish). Also this is just a basic overview; many schools run things slightly differently to how I've described.

State school starts at age 4/5, between age 4-11 you are at Primary School, and you then move on at age 11 to Secondary School. Your school is decided by catchment area (i.e. where you live). In Year 11, when you are about 16 years old, you take exams called GCSEs. You have to do Maths, Science, English and then you pick 5 or 6 other subjects; things like Geography, RS, IT etc.

After 16 you have Years 12 and 13. These years can be spent at the same Secondary School you went to from age 11, and are usually referred to as Sixth Form in such cases, but lots of schools finish at 16 so people go on to college for Years 12+13. At colleges people do A Levels which usually involves 3 subjects being studied fairly in depth. These, like GCSEs are exam based but also contained assessed courseworks.

The Independent School system (fee paying) is a little different. This also varies *massively* between schools, but for the more expensive, famous fee paying schools, ""public schools"", you go to a Preparatory until age 13 when you take exams to get into senior school which runs 13-18. 

There is also a Grammar School system that runs in some parts of the UK that requires you to take an exam at age 11 to gain entrance to a school (I don't know much about these schools).

Post A Level, age 18, you go to university. That's what Americans would call College. Entrance requirements vary hugely between institutions. Currently fees for undergraduate study in the UK is £9000 per year. Most undergraduate degrees take 3 years to complete, but Medicine is 5 (followed by several years of on the job training). You can do an undergraduate degree in Law but to be a qualified lawyer you need to take another 1 year course and then (I think) do 2 years in house training with a firm.

As you can see, it's not the most straight forward of systems! Our current Education Minister is also a fan of ""reform"" so this could all have been scrapped by the time you read this.

&gt;Using the most widely accepted statistical model, drawn up by a Norwegian academic using data from 100 studies in more than a dozen countries, an increase in average traffic speeds of just 3mph – a typical change for a 10mph rise – would be expected to cause more than 25 extra deaths a year on motorways and more than 100 serious injuries.

&gt;Advocates of the change cite existing flouting of the 70mph limit, saying an 80mph maximum would make little practical difference. But campaigners in the US, which has seen dozens of state-wide changes since the federal 55mph maximum was abolished in the late 1980s, say data shows drivers eventually revert to old habits. ""You can see that each time the speed limit went up, speeds went up as well. Drivers were still breaking the law – it took a little while till they broke the law as much as they used to, but people gradually tested the tolerance zone.""

true,harberton,null,null,"It's different in Scotland, but in England (some areas might still do a tertiary system of first school, middle school, high school):

ages 4/5-11: primary school.
11-16: secondary school.
16+: sixth form or college.

At the end of primary school you transition to secondary school regardless. It is possible to pick to apply to your own secondary school, but all primary schools have a kind of automatic progression to a certain local school (still, there will be paperwork). The secondary school might do some of their own tests to then stream brighter kids etc. but there's no official test for this. You will however do tests called SATS to assess your level. (pronounced sats as a word not an abbreviation)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Curriculum_assessment

At the end of secondary school you do GCSEs (General Certificate of Secondary Education). These are graded A*-E (and U for unclassified). You can do lots of these across all subjects. A*-C is considered a pass, and it is hoped you can gain at least 5 A*-C grades. The average is probably around 9 or 10 GCSEs.

Once you're 16 and if you're staying in education you can go to sixth form or college. A sixth form can be its own institution or part of a secondary school. You will generally need 5 GCSE passes (see earlier) for sixth form where you spend 2 years. In your first year you tend to pick 4 AS levels and then drop one in the second year to have 3 A levels. There is no B level, A level just means 'Advanced Level'. AS is Advanced Subsidiary. A levels are also graded A*-E. Exams are written. There will be oral exams for foreign languages, and practicals in things like music and sciences, but all have some written component. Some courses may have coursework to be prepared in advance. A levels and GCSEs are awarded by exam boards (OCR, Edexcel and AQA being the main ones) and each can have different requirements for the same subject. One board might do 100% exam while another might do 75% exam + 25% coursework, for example. They are all regulated so they're equivalent qualifications, but content of the same A level course might vary between exam boards. 

Colleges can also offer A levels. A levels tend to be 'traditional' subjects like English, Chemistry, French and so on. They also offer vocational qualifications such as BTECs or NVQs in a wide range of subjects for whatever you want to do, be that hairdressing, car repair, social care etc.

To progress to university you need to complete a UCAS application. Many qualifications are accepted, but A levels will be the most common. University is what an American person might call college. University is graded by 1st, 2:1, 2:2, Third (and maybe others depending on where you go). A 1st is generally scoring 70%+, 2:1 60%+ and so on.

I don't know how medicine and law differs from the US. But to become a medical doctor you can join a medicine course straight from your school or college at the age of 18. Courses tend to take 5 years (some are 6 years but often also include a BSc) after which you can be a doctor, but then you have at least 2 further years of foundation training outside university and there will be specialisation training after that. You can also do medicine as a graduate, and graduate courses are often only 4 years long.

With Law you join a law degree and you can an LLB as opposed to a BA or BSc. This takes 3 years like most other degrees. (It will be possible to do a 4 year course in some places). Once you have your LLB I'm not sure on the process, but obviously to be a barrister you need to pass the bar exams.

Education is free up to the age of 18. University costs a maximum of £9,000 per academic year for undergraduate. International students pay more. For postgraduate qualifications universities can charge whatever they want.

true,Shanessa,null,null,"Scotland's system is separate, though similar in many respects (though I don't think we have grammar schools, and we have separate 'private' schools that require fees).

Primary school is from age 5, years called P1, P2 etc until P7. Interestingly, in Scotland the cutoff in determining the year you will be in is between February and March, unlike England. So if you are born in March you'll be old for the year and if you're born in February you'll be young.

At 12 you go to secondary school and do various subjects. There are a total of 6 years. There's a new system coming in now which I'm not too sure on but I remember it as you do National 4 and 5 exams at 16 and Highers at 17. Nationals are like gcses and highers are our exams for university entrance. You normally do four or five of them. Then after you can go straight to university or stay on til S6 and do advanced highers or more highers or a mix of the two if you need more qualifications for uni or just want to learn more. Most people in my school stayed on, but we were very university orientated.

More recently, my children attended the same elementary school as the ""Dove Outreach center"" - with the brilliant pastor who managed to get Presidential attention by threatening to burn the Quoran, he was also part of sending kids to elementary school wearing T-shirts saying ""Islam is of the Devil"" - that school has a population of about 800, and I think at least 13 of the children there are associated with the Dove Outreach center.... the county sidestepped the free speech issues by requiring all public school students to wear uniforms.

The England and Wales version doesn't do this either, but nobody in the mainstream media seems to have understood that.

The Church of England is governed by its own separate laws.  If they wanted to solemnise same-sex marriages, they would have to introduce their own legislation.  I believe the procedure is that it has to be passed by their governing body, then approved by Parliament's Ecclesiastical Committee, then passed by a simple up-or-down vote in both the Commons and the Lords.  Including them in the law would have meant completely rewriting the relationship between church and state.  If they change their minds at some stage and decide they want to solemnise same-sex marriages, they can easily introduce the necessary legislation themselves and it's hard to imagine Parliament standing in their way.

The situation with the Church in Wales is a little more complicated.  At the moment, they don't support same-sex marriage and have a special legal duty to marry any couple in Wales who ask them (with certain exceptions).  They might change their mind about same-sex marriage in the future, in which case they may or may not want their legal duty to extend to same-sex couples.  The new law deals with this uncertainty by leaving the Church in Wales out for now, but providing the government with a power to allow the Church in Wales to opt in, and potentially amend their statutory duty, without new primary legislation.",0,1391614405,null,0,false,0,cf7o9sk,t3_1x08bt,t1_cf7o9sk,t1_cf71eb6,null,1432262967,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Uh, no. After grabbing the leftovers and not being satisfied, you gradually built up a stronger military force, and used them to win a series of wars. In particularly the War of Spanish Succession and the Seven Years' War, the combination which effectively neutered Spain, France and Portugal. 

Then later the Napoleonic Wars helped cement Britain's position, and left you guys free to wage a long string of smaller wars and invasions all over the globe with little serious opposition.

Housing benefit doesn't cost that much. It's more about pension costs, administration &amp; staffing, and PFI.

You clearly don't understand much about how the welfare system is run and how much it costs.  Housing benefit is expensive - sure - but even if we build hundreds of thousands of social houses, the taxpayer would still have to cough up the bn's needed to pay for them.

Taxes are high because government is huge (45% of GDP.) Therefore, to run it they need to take a large slice of your income. Want lower taxes? reduce the size of government. Start by paying off our debt.

1. Primary School: 4/5 - 11 years
2. Secondary School: 11 -16 years
3. A - Levels/ College/ Apprenticeship: 16 - 18 years
4. University 
5. Post graduate education (masters, for example) 

&gt; How do you transition from one level to another (written exams? orals? both?)?

At the end of primary school you do a written exam in Maths, English and Science. At the end of secondary school you do GCSEs (general certificate of secondary education)  you have to do Maths, English and Science, and 4 subjects of your choice, these are examined in various ways, coursework (usually for subjects like Art and Drama where practical stuff is involved ) written exams, and oral exam for foreign languages and English.  

&gt; What's the difference between ""college"" and ""university""?  

College is someone you have the option to go when you are 16, generally you go to get a diploma which will help you advance into a specific career path, childcare or catering, for example. University is where you go to get a degree, A-Levels (or a equivalent) are required to get into these.  

&gt; What does it mean to get a ""first""?

Highest grade at university level 

&gt;  What's an ""a-level"" and is there a ""b-level""? 

A Level stands for advanced level, as they optional after you finish your GCSEs 

&gt; How does studying law or medicine or getting a doctorate-level degree differ from the U.S?

Law is the same as any other degree, but if you want to go on and be a solicitor, barrister ect you need to do a a year of studying after university, and then job training. Medicine is similar to other degrees, but they take a couple of years longer and you also have to do job training afterwards . Not sure about doctorates, sorry.  

&gt; How much does it cost?

Free until university, then it is £9000 a year (unless you're Scottish, then it's free, but I'm not going to get in a rant about that)

Are you saying that they knowingly inserted a negotiation clause which allowed the club to reject offers and hence negating any point to the existence of a clause in the first place? Just because it's in a contract doesn't mean it is legal. There is zero legal precedent for release clauses in England, any players who have moved on the price of their release clause did so because their clubs decided to honour a gentlemen's agreement, and also because they knew that the release clause price is likely to be the best bid they would get. If a club decides to ignore it, then it means they can afford not earning the money, which is precisely what happened with Konoplyanka.

As for Salah, Liverpool had already come in with an initial bid. Chelsea, on the other hand, has shown a willingness to overbid other clubs, as was the case with Willian. Notice how the Salah rumours started the moment the Mata deal looked to be completed. Even if Chelsea did not make any requests to keep things quiet, they might have had made discreet enquiries much earlier. Salah's agent still had every incentive to drag the Liverpool deal for as long as possible, as long as he was sure there could be other potential suitors. The point I am making is that nobody, not Ian Ayre, not Daniel Levy and not David Gill, can force a club to conclude a deal early when it regards a player that is highly rated and an integral part of the team. Leverage only happens when the club is desperate to offload a player and wants to prevent suitors from looking elsewhere.

Then there's the next manager to consider, whether it's Gary Monk or someone else, they might be someone our current players want to stay and work with, or he might not fancy some of them and get rid anyway.

I went to an all girls grammar school. Beyond the entrance exam, there's really no obvious difference between a grammar and a state school that I'm aware of. The entrance exam at 11 is called the 11 Plus, and it tests you on maths, verbal reasoning and non verbal reasoning. The highest percentage of children who pass are offered entrance to the grammar school, so they basically cream off most of the most intelligent kids in the area. There are no fees to attend.

In my school we were very much expected to work to a higher standard than most, there wasn't that much 'set' separation other than in Maths and Science, and it was compulsory for us to study Latin.

true,amaurosisfugax,null,null,"Simply, it's frowned upon because you are not Scottish. Scottish is a nationality, it's not a race or an ethnicity. It means to have been born in, raised in or set up home in Scotland.

My grandmother was Irish, as was her father in law. My other side of the family of that generation were also irish. My name is so Irish that I've been assumed to be of the emerald isle by a good number of people outwith the british isles. I have living relatives in the Irish countryside, and I visit them at least once every couple of years.

But I'm not, and never would call myself, Irish. I'm Scottish. My forebears emigrated from ireland to here for work, love and a host of other reasons. 
Being from Glasgow, my heritage played an important part in my development. I was raised catholic, went to catholic school, holidayed in ireland, supported celtic, got to grips with the subtle separateness from the traditional institutions of scotland such as the kirk.

So I know where you're coming from when you want to identify with your heritage. It sets you apart from other americans and may have subtly influenced your development as a person. However, the ""cultural"" difference you lay claim to is really only a further manifestation of the overarching culture in which you grew up. In the same way that my ""Irishness"" is little more than identification with an immigrant tradition that split from, and developed separately from the actual, living, changing Irishness that characterises the lives of my relatives in Ireland.

Any Scottishness you identify with is, at best, an american interpretation, no doubt coloured by all the couthy haggis, tartan, bagpipes and shortbread shite that plays well in the scottish tourism industry (not that I don't like all these things, but they aren't exactly the defining characteristics of my existence). At worst it's a taxidermied museum piece from the mid-nineteenth centrury. 

This doesn't mean that your immigrant tradition is not important, distinctive or worthwhile. It just means that it's not properly Scottish as Scots understand the term. Any identification you can make as Scottish is only valid within America, compared to other Americans, because in the face of your myriad similarities, it is what sets you apart. However,  when compared with Scots, any scottish affinities we may share are swamped by the differences that exist due to your 'Americanness"".

Therefore, when you identify as Scottish to us, you trivialise us. You freeze our cultural development in time. You ignore the realities of modern, vibrant Scottishness, the realities which have formed us and which inform our day to day conduct. Frankly it makes me feel like a tourist attraction.

Not that I don't love that ""Scottish"" Americans want to connect with their ancestral culture in some way, but a vital part of that journey is to visit Scotland and admit to your own foreignness from it.",0,1391619166,null,0,false,0,cf7qe9v,t3_1x2f4k,t1_cf7qe9v,t3_1x2f4k,null,1432263966,11,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,11

Lack of competition, too unionised, not enough pressure/involvement from local government for the money they put in.

The running of the transport network should really be put out to tender, let companies EU wide submit bids as to how they'd run the network, how much they'd be costing users, how they'd create a cohesive strategy across all modes of transport. If that means bringing in cheap non-union drivers from the rest of the EU, so be it. Winner gets to run the network, government holds them to account if they don't deliver.

For example, underperforming but big salaried players could be loaned to these clubs and these clubs would then ostensibly be ""covering"" their wages, thus freeing up that cash for the parent club and making the balance sheet look healthier. In reality of course the parent club is still paying their wages since they own such a large stake in the smaller club, but the ownership is structured in such a way so as to make it appear like an independent entity (and not covered by UEFA for that matter). This can also go the other way, with players signed up by the smaller club being sent on loan to the larger club but still having their wages covered by the feeder.

true,shoryukenist,null,null,"Exactly right.  This whole thing boils down to linguistic differences.  In America, if you tell someone you are Italian, you are doing nothing more than saying that your great, great, great grandfather moved here from Italy in 1890.  I suppose you also convey that you belong to the ""Italian"" American culture, which has nothing to do with Italy, just like Irish American culture has nothing to do with Ireland.  But you are in no way stating that whatever subculture you belong to comes first, you are an American.  It does give a point of reference to other Americans however, and is useful in that regard.

However, these conventions do not work well abroad at all.  If you tell an Englishman you are Italian, he will think you are nuts, because he has met actual Italians, and this American probably doesn't even speak one word of Italian.  I'm sure it is more grating to hear an American say that to someone who is actually from that country.  

Funny though, I've seen it work the other way.  I studied in London in the late '90s, and our program was through a NY school, and we lived in the international dorms.  So you had many countries represented in the dorms.  Being from NY, we were a diverse group from a heritage perspective, lot of Jews, Indians (not Native American kind), Irish heritage, etc. etc.  I remember an Italian girl going to my ""Indian"" friend (who was born in NY and 1000% Americanized) and asking him ""what he was.""  He said American, and she goes ""No, you are brown, what are you really?""  Massive cringe, he was pissed.  She never asked any white Americans for their background, because to her perception, we were just plain old Americans. 

UK people didn't seem to have any of these issues with identity at all, and your outlook on ""heritage"" is very similar to ours.  If you are born in England, speak English and function as a member of society, you are going to be considered British, no matter what you look like.  Though I don't know if you guys are as enamored with immigrants who go through the process to become citizens as we are, it never came up.

Only thing we got from the Brits (and this was the very first day or two) were crazy stereotypes based on Jerry Springer.  They expected a bunch of kids from the NYC area to be evangelical Christians, and they seemed surprised non of us were fat.

O-levels were for the more academic people, who were likely to go on to do A-levels, and GCSE's for the less academically gifted etc. However, it was seen as bad for people to split up like that at 13/14 (when they started studying for them) so they joined O-levels and GCSE's into one thing and called it GCSE's. This was a while ago, I think my mum did O-levels and my dad did the new GCSE's ie. he didn't have the option of O-levels, because they weren't around any more. So, approximately a generation ago.

With the current 'reforms' which have been mentioned, many like to go on (particularly the media) about how O-levels were so much harder etc. 

So anyway, that's where A-levels come from, when there were ordinary levels and advanced levels, but changes got rid of one but kept the other. (Also, tiering in GCSE's takes part of the place of this splitting off. Lower tier exams are easier, but to get a C you need a higher percentage than on a higher tier paper.

As for the nationalist side, I couldn't go along with SF's left wing policies and have seen the mess they have made of the education system, scrapping transfer tests but not really replacing them, left the schools in a vacuum. Previously i would have been happy to see any of the RoI parties set up shop up north, although I understand that ideologically speaking that could only be Fianna Fail, I suppose they've shown themselves up a little in mishandling the Irish economy.

Ethnicity as far as I can make out is to do with the cultural background of a person. In that case, a ""Scottish"" American person *is still not ethnically Scottish* - they are American with Scottish heritage. There is *no way* that a ""Scottish"" American, on moving to Scotland, would just fit right in with the locals. They are *American*, NOT Scottish. Here's a quote from [this article](http://www.diffen.com/difference/Ethnicity_vs_Race) about it

&gt; there are many ethnicities within the Caucasian race e.g. Irish, Welsh, German, French, Slovak etc. What differentiates these ethnic groups from each other is their country of origin, language they speak, cultural heritage and traditions, beliefs and rituals.

*Country of origin*. IE Scottish people *are from Scotland*. 

*Language*. ""Scottish"" American people do NOT talk the same as actual Scottish people. 

*Cultural heritage* There is NO way that a ""Scottish"" American person has the same experience of Scottish culture, as someone who actually grew up in Scotland. DO NOT try to claim that they do, any attempt to do so will be extremely reductive as to what Scottish culture actually is. Hint: there is more to it than haggis, whisky, Burn's night, Irn Bru, Hogmanay and fried food...

*Traditions, beliefs and rituals* This is the ONE area where I think that a ""Scottish"" American and an actual Scottish person might be comparable BUT obviously the American person will also have *American* traditions, beliefs and rituals, making them different again from actual Scottish people.

The fact that we can stand our ground with the top half of the table, but not being able to show the same consistent form against teams like Villa, Hull, and West Brom? Shankly had some of the greatest quotes that should exemplify how Liverpool should play and deal with transfers:

Source: http://myliverpoolfc.org/quotes.htm

Complacency and lack of concentration played a huge part against West Brom. Not to mention, it seemed like we were happy with keeping a 1-0 lead.

""For a player to be good enough to play for Liverpool, he must be prepared
to run through a brick wall for me then come out fighting on the other side.""

We need to start signing the players that the manager wants. Imagine if we managed to bring in Mhkitaryan, Diego Costa, or Willian over the summer, or Salah/Konoplyanka this January? I think the increase in certainty in achieving Champions League next season, outweighs the amount of money spent on a player to help bolster the squad. In order to make money, you have to spend money.

""At a football club, there's a holy trinity - the players, the manager and the supporters.
Directors don't come into it. They are only there to sign the cheques.""

true,Simon_Riley,lfc68,,"who vs who is random when it's knockout but during group selection it depends on country: no same league in same group and it depends on the seed priority.  

there is only one group stage in the CL and that's the main one you see with 4 teams each and 8 groups total.  Now the CL we know is group stage --&gt; round of 16 --&gt; quarters --&gt; Semi --&gt; Final.  It is essentially the same as the World Cup with 32 teams total.  How those 32 teams got there will answer your question 2, 3, and 4.  

Of the 32 teams in the 22 teams around the world (Top 3 in EPL for example) gets in automatically.  the remaining 10 spots are decided in what's refered to as the: Qualifying + Playoff Round.  IT is still the CL but it's more obscure (only final round is on TV usually).  

Now the Qualiying and Playoff Round is made up of: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd qualifying rounds as well as a final playoff round (4th).  Teams may enter the CL qualification process at any round depending how their league is in term of competitiveness.  For example, EPL has high competitive rating so 4th in league means you start at the final Play Off round or the final round.  You beat one team in 2 legged fashion and you are in.  However, you may be champion of a small league in Europe but due to the low competitive rating, you may only enter in the 2nd round and 2nd place in the small league gets nothing in term of CL.  However, there is further division based on whether you get in as a champion of a small league or a high league finish in a bigger league (i.e. ukraine?)  This is termed the **champions route** and the **league route**.  This is to give a bit more advantage to those who actually wins the league, no matter how small it is. How it works is rather complicated so suffer with me.  

1st round: few small teams (4 this year) do the 2 legged match to see which 2 out of the 4 goes into 2nd round.  

2nd round: 32 teams enter this round + 2 from 1st round so 34 total .  In simple terms, teams are divided in seeded and unseeded fashion where seeded team play an unseeded team in home and away fashion (2 leg) and winner will advance.  The seeded team are champions of their league last year (or most recent when 2nd round starts? some league have diferent start/end time so im not sure). I.e. Celtics, the Scottish League champion entered CL in this round this season as a seeded team and played the unseeded team clifftonville (wut?)  

3rd round: 30 teams which is 17 teams from the 2nd round that won plus 13 more that enter in this round. Here's comes the division of Champ vs League route:  20 teams are considered to be Champions Route (17 from round 2 + 3 more league champs) and 10 teams are in the League Route who entered the qualification in this round. League Route teams play only league teams (those 10 makes 5 pairs) and champion route play champion route teams (20 teams make 10 pairs).  Now who's seeded vs who's not seeded depends on their respective rating/points.  FC Basel (swiss winner) entered in this round as champion route

4th round aka playoff: 20 teams (10 league and 10 champ route).  10 champ route teams are the 10 champ route winner of round 3.  10 league route teams are the 5 that won their games in round 3 + 5 new ones that enter here.  should Liverpool get 4th, we will be here and we are playing against a high league finisher (non-champ) of some other leagues.  who plays who is once again in a seed vs non seed fashion depending on league coefficient and pts and etc.  the winner of Khazakahstan actually made it all the way here this year as an unseeded team of champ route (they started in round 2 i think).  Liverpool will for sure be seeded  (like im 99% sure on this).  Lyon who played in 3rd round and won, is still seeded in 4th round.  The notable unseeded team of this years league route: PSV eindhove, Fenebache, Real Sociedad.  This means **4th in EPL almost gurantees a spot in group stage unless you majorly choke**  

Some fun facts: when we won in Istanbul but finished 5th in league, there was a debate whether or not we'd be in the next champions league.  People felt that liverpool deserved to defend their title and in the end both everton and Liverpool entered the CL.  Everton in the later rounds and liverpool had to start from 1st round.  Though the structure has changed a lot since then.  For the 2013-2014 qualifying: **3** teams out of 32 entering in **round 2** made it to group stage,  **3** teams out of 13 (either route) entering in **round 3** made it to group stage, and **4** teams out of 5 entering in **playoff round** made it to group stage.  nobody in round 1 made it obviously.  

hope you are a pro at CL now.

Come on, it's clear I'm not saying that if you get high increases in productivity then high wage growth will occur. Productivity growth is a necessary condition for sustained real wage growth, not a sufficient one.

Productivity growth since 2008 has been stagnant. Unemployment hasn't risen as high as economists thought it might, but at the cost of underemployment and a fall in productivity.

My understanding of the difference with medical degrees is that there is no pre-med and then medicine, you just start straight off on a 5 year medical degree.

One difference with doctorates here is you can go straight from undergraduate to a doctorate, although most people will typically do a master's first. But your master's and PhD are separate and you would graduate from your UG, then your master's, then your PhD. 

PhD's here are much more ""focussed"", in that you basically just crack on with your project and don't do much of a taught aspect. Then you'll do a viva and report in 1st year, then a final viva and your thesis in your final year (typically year 3 or 4 depending on your funding).

There are some striking similarities between the economies of the UK and the US of the 1990s-2000s and the 1910s-1920s. Both were periods in history characterised by a long boom, rampant speculation on the financial markets and a wide gulf between rich and poor. 

However, WWI and WWII had a massive social and political impact. [The ruling elites lost much of their power](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/15/firstworldwar) after WWI to people who refused to work as servants and now had the vote. In the late 1930s in the US and in the aftermath of WWII in the UK, Keynesian policies - as in recent years - essentially saved the market from collapsing in on itself. 

The 1920s didn't last. It was only generations later that laissez-faire began to be taken seriously again, and only then out of desperation. We had at least three decades of popular support for Keynesian and socialist policies - during which we established the NHS in 1948, the same year [social security was extended.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assistance_Act_1948)

In many ways, it was surprising that we didn't get a massive shift to the left after 2008 that was equivalent to the shift to the right in the 1970s. The Great Recession should have been just as destructive for the prevailing economic theory as the Great Inflation was in the 1970s. Robert Skidelsky says somewhere that perhaps the 2008-9 recession wasn't *deep* enough to prompt a radical change. 

Then again, [many have been talking seriously about ""the next economic crisis"",](http://www.bis.org/review/r091111e.pdf) which could be serious enough to prompt a real change. If we have a Japanese-style ""lost decade"" or lost decades, even, then enough support could build up to turn things in workers' favour.

For starters if City had taken one of their early chances then he doesn't write this article. Secondly the comparison with Mourinho's Chelsea is a non starter to begin with. He inherited a Chelsea side that finished 3rd last year, won the CL the year before and inherited a defence that includes Ivanovic (1 title, 3 FA cups, 1 CL), John Terry (3 titles, 5 FA cups, 1 CL), David Luiz (1 FA Cup, 1 CL £25m price tag at 22 years old), Ashley Cole (3 league titles, 7 FA cups, 1 CL) and Petr Cech (3 titles, 3 FA cups, 1 CL). Not only that but these guys have all been together for at least 2 and a half season before he arrived and been coached by Rafael Benitez, Andre Vilas-Boas and Carlo Ancelotti. And as he mentioned in the article: we've only conceded 9 less than they have this season and we have a higher goal difference.

He also went to City with no injuries - we went there with Aly Cissokho and Martin Skrtel starting (neither would be an automatic first choice)- along with an injured Glen Johnson - and 2 midfielders carrying knocks.

The reason Chelsea are talked about as being in the title race is obvious; a) they're 6 points ahead of us - in touching distance of top spot, b) they have a manager who's been there and done it before and is in the eye of the media the best in the business at the moment and c) because we've finished the last 4 seasons 7th, 8th, 6th and 8th. 

This writer compares Rodgers to Benitez, Houllier, Evans and no one else. As if the only the point of reference that Rodgers has is with his predecessors. So Houllier built his Liverpool side on bofbof2 and keeping a clean sheet. So fucking what? I don't remember him being in any title races (2002 doesn't count - we finished 2nd but we never looked like winning it). And the comparison with Benitez's 05/06 side, who cares? That was 8 years ago and the league's changed - not to mention that we have more points now than we did after 24 games that season.  


&gt;Of all the managerial eras at this club, Brendan’s has most resembled that of Roy Evans. He too had a deadly duo up front, Robbie Fowler and Stan Collymore. The midfield usually consisted of John Barnes, Jamie Redknapp and Steve McManaman; gifted and classy but, once under the cosh, apt to go AWOL. By his final year, Liverpool even struggled to win with three goals never mind two. That was despite trying to shore things up with the help of Paul Ince, Oyvind Leonhardsen and a dreary surrender to 4-4-2. When he tampered with his own formula, Evans lost what was good about his team originally. That is my fear for Brendan.

This is just bullshit. If he can compare Evans' Liverpool with Rodgers' Liverpool on the basis that both sides had 2 good fellas up front but didn't always keep a clean sheet then I can compare us to Guardiola's Barcelona, or Van Gaal's Ajax, or Michel's Ajax - because we like to pass the ball a bit and score a lot of goals (actually my comparison is a lot more apt because of the tactical similarities but I won't go into that now).  The part about changing systems is utter dross too - Rodgers' has played 3-5-2, 4-2-3-1, 4-4-2 and 4-3-3 this season and won with all of them. This is all nonsense.

&gt;While I don’t agree with religious inspired sentiments that oppose Gay marriage, I realise that these beliefs are firmly held and I do respect and tolerate this kind of viewpoint (although not understand them).

How are you using the word 'respect' here? I certainly tolerate such beliefs in that I don't think such beliefs should be made illegal, but I have absolutely no respect for a general viewpoint that views a verifiably normal, healthy sexual orientation as worthy of anything but totally equal treatment. I would attempt to remain polite during a discussion of homosexuality/gay marriage with a person who held such a view (and if this is the sense in which you meant 'respect' then I agree with you), but I have the absolute opposite of admiration for it and don't believe it deserves any due regard (beyond a polite engagement if relevant).

&gt;I also feel that it’s morally indefensible to force any religion to participate in a Gay Marriage ceremony against their beliefs. 

I think this is a slightly moot point - although the Coalition for Marriage managed to get one lawyer to insist that the legal protections that mean churches won't be forced to marry homosexuals are weak, it's clearly a religiously-motivated fringe opinion, as evidenced by the comprehensive debunking of his claims [here](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/212544/Response_to_Aidan_O_Neill_QC_s_legal_opinion.pdf).

I'm not saying your proposal is necessarily bad, just that the current gay marriage laws in the rest of the UK already allow marriage for all without trampling on some very strange, extremely discriminatory and deeply held religious views.

Agree to an extent, though personally I'd rather have a manager who speaks sense and realistic terms, than have a manager like Moyes claiming he still thinks Utd are still title contenders when they're currently sat on odds of 150/1. If the manager just seems to be talking hyperbole most of the time then he stops being someone people take seriously.

I'd say winning the title isn't impossible, but it's asking three teams that are playing well to all drop quite a few points, and it seems pretty unlikely.

In 1958, the City of Manchester issued it's first official coat of arms based heavily on the old heraldic coat of arms that had developed over centuries since the 1300s, and existed in many subtly different forms across the city.

Being ignorant of the contents of the sandwich between the slices, this sample lunch appears to be quite high in carbohydrates and severely lacking in protein. Should this be a regular occurrence and the school dedicated to improving diet, it would be enough to set up warning flags.

Seems pertinent, then, to look at [this source](http://www.windsorobserver.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2014/02/05/97444-headteacher-says-pupil-expelled-for-bringing-in-mini-cheddars-committed-persistent-and-deliberate-breaches-of-healthy-eating-policy/) which apparently gives more information on the dietary missteps.

&gt;We have not excluded a pupil for just having mini cheddars in their lunchbox, but where there is a persistent and deliberate breach of school policy, such as bringing in crisps, biscuits, sausage rolls, mini sausages, scotch eggs and similar, and all other avenues have been exhausted, the Governors would expect further action to be taken. 

So high carb/fat and low protein lunches were common place?

We have other players who fit that role better.  I think we just need to give him some proper minutes with an attacking group of players that suits him, and tell him to have at it.

The dystopian nightmare I paint *is* the logical extension of this way of thinking. The premise that parents *must* listen to Jamie Oliver and accept his mantra into their heart could extend to a multitude of issues (e.g. religion?) which essentially boil down to whether or not we're allowed to trust parents to raise their kids.

The counter-argument that I would posit is that we trust parents to raise their children. Creating a regional or national law to enforce the ideas that go beyond human rights are unfair to those that are in more unfortunate positions. Single parents would be an example of such an ""unfortunate"" position that they don't possess the additional time required to do all these things.

The USA vehemently seems to oppose any sort of European military alliance that might be seen as a shift in direction to NATO. This is unsurprising since NATO is effectively a US controlled proxy in exactly the same way as the Warsaw Pact was a proxy of the USSR. The recent spying allegations also suggest that NATO has probably been used a vehicle for US intelligence operations in Europe.

In essence, for it to happen;

* The UK and France would need to establish some sort of mutual understanding on how such a project would be embarked upon - since they would essentially form the backbone of it for the foreseeable mid-term at least. 

* Germany would need to *""get over""* it's issues with foreign policy and the use of force to achieve it. That is actually going to be surprisingly hard, as that mentality is beaten into Germans from a young age as a sort of post-war Dogma on the use of force for political ends. 

* It would need to have ascent from the other EU members. Since we would be forming the backbone of it, we would need to make sure that our own defense assets couldn't be hamstrung by disagreements within the EU. i.e. we end up contributing our forces only to find that we aren't able to use them when we would have been able to had we go it alone. In a nutshell, we can't be having Belgium tell our army what it can and cannot do.

Increasingly though it seems like the UK and Frances are losing the historical differences that made defense co-operation difficult. In particular I could see there extensive integration between their two navies as being a very obvious area we could work on. It is a great shame the french chose not to buy a carrier of the QE class like our two new carriers. It would have opened the door to a very deep level of integration.

It won't until you go there. You'll hear Z Cars come booming from the speakers and the crowd start to roar as the players take to the pitch. Every single hair on the back of your neck will stand on end and you will realise that this is where you were born to be.

Aside from being our home, it would be a massive shame to lose a traditional football ground like Goodison. The way the stands rise up from the surrounding rows of terraced houses show how this is a club that grew at the heart of a community. It's rare to see stadiums like that anymore. You walk down County Road and it feels like any local high street; pound shops, pubs, chippies and bookies. Yet, you are metres away from the home of one of the most successful football clubs in English history.

I've been to a few modern grounds, miles out of the city. Usually on the edge of a retail park or something. Pretty much what we'd have got with Kirkby to be honest. Good, modern grounds, but they just lack that bit of soul that you get from an old-fashioned stadium. Even the Emirates lacks the soul of Highbury despite only being a couple of streets over.

Personally, I'd love for them to redevelop Goodison in some way, but it is just not economically feasible. It would be a labour of love, not something that your average owner would consider doing.

However, like you, I wouldn't be completely against a new ground, as sad as it would be. You just have to wonder where the money will come from. A new stadium could hold us back financially for years. Look at what moving from Highbury to the Emirates did to Arsenal's financial situation. Ozil was their first big-money signing in absolutely ages. The prospect of developing a stadium in Stanley Park is an exciting one, as the shite look to be redeveloping their pit rather than looking to build anew. I just don't think most fans want the only viable option to be a stadium built into the side of a massive Tesco in Kikrby.

Just to warn you the course is expensive and you have to pay separately for the license (which you have to pay to renew every 3 years). Best bet is to find an employer that will put you through the course on the condition you then work for them. But the license itself will be yours, so if you wish to work for more than 1 company (i.e. shop security and bouncer) you can.

personally I would recommend being a bouncer over shop security.

The Flood was so used to infecting the Ice Warriors (It may have been elsewhere, but the Ice Warriors were native to Mars, so presumably they were the first infected) that they started to almost automatically mimic trace elements of the Ice Warriors when they were unfrozen (imagine a chameleon stuck on one color/pattern). That is my humble theory about the mouth cracks originating from The Flood.

EDIT: Im sure some of you have read this and gone ""Dumbass, The Ice Warriors are wearing armor"". look at the second Cold War pic. Thats what im imagining when i see the mouth cracks, not the armor

Again prohibition has made a relatively safe drug into a killer.

Things like silica, lead (in Germany - which caused poisoning) , glass have been added to weed - unless you 100% know where your weed is being produced its a case of buyer beware - again a fairly safe (one of the safest) drugs is being contaminated and made dangerous purely because of prohibition.

Regarding the contamination :-

Even the USA organisation Norml gave a warning ....

http://stash.norml.org/beware-the-grit-weed.

As well as not funding gang legalised weed would be safer for the majority.

The UK has been flooded with it since about 2006. Most weed sold by gangs/taxi drivers, etc is in some way fucked with - only trust stuff you know where it originates.

1. Split tickets. To separate tickets from a popular station to an unpopular station, then unpopular station to a popular station are usually cheaper than one ticket from a popular station to another popular station. Play around with some of the online train tools. 

2. Carnets - Some train providers will allow you to buy tickets in books of six or more with a 10 - 25% discount. Combine with step one above. You can't always buy these online, phone the operator and find out. You may be able to combine this with your 16-25 railcard. 

3. Advance - If you have a relatively fixed commute (i.e. travel to the same place at the same time) you can get advance tickets. Even if an advance ticket is unsuitable you can sometimes get a discount for booking up to 12 weeks in advance. Walk up fares are normally the most expensive.

Then I Googled another article using her name and the term 'mental health' and it gets stranger.   She'd done something similar  before in 2009.  

This time she's had her stepmother arrested after her biological father tracked her down after not seeing her for 21 years (so she was abandoned between the ages of 2 and 4).  In their first meeting she'd 'jumped' out of a moving car after an altercation. She's blamed for running a vendetta which is claimed ended up in the breakdown of her father's marriage.  They have restraining orders against her and the police have had to confiscate her computer.  And whilst of itself not indicative of anything her husband is 33 years her senior, who in her defence said she had mental health problems.  I think he's right.  It screams ongoing pathological daddy issues. 

How in the hell is this person being sent to prison?         
Now I'm wondering what the facilities and vacancies are in Cornwall for detainees under section 3 of the mental health act - and whether we're sending more people to prison because of a shortage of places.

       ""Mental health services have been under an inordinate 
        pressure over the past few weeks, with no inpatient 
        beds in the public or private sector available in the 
        whole of England according to several clinicians."" 

                                            former president Royal College 
                                            of Psychiatrists.     23.09.13

That suggests that towards the end of last year they physically ran out of all available beds across the whole of England!!!

Then there's a FoI report that says in real terms there's been a national 2% budget cut and we've seen an increase in demand of 16%.

I'll admit that this news story about a crisis in the shortage in mental health care has passed under my radar.  I knew they'd been warning about a breaking point for some time, but still.  Now I'm really interested to see if she was even evaluated under a 28 day section 2 notice, whether she passed,  and if not why was she given a restraining order when she should have been in care.  Or worse, did she fail an evaluation but there simply wasn't any room at the inn with no beds available for a 6 month section 3 referral?

I'm willing to accept it's probably coincidental until something more watertight appears, but that stretched Cornwall mental health facilities were the first to be mentioned in a top 10 list on a communitycare page Google threw up doesn't bode well...  

        Patients told Care Quality Commission inspectors that they 
        received “dismissive” advice when they rang Cornwall Partnership 
        NHS Trust’s home treatment team for crisis support. One patient 
        who phoned for help was told: “I am the only one working, don’t 
        kill yourself on my shift”.

[EDIT]  And apparently,

         Out-of-hours care is lacking. Just two nurses and a social worker were 
         expected to provide out-of-hours crisis response for Cornwall, a county 
         with a population of over 500,000, a CQC report shows.
                                                                                                     [/E]

On top of that, they have in-house response teams who actively monitor their networks for signs of compromise. Remember, they've got government-sponsored chinese hackers hitting them every day, and they're pretty serious about preventing that.

The only likely success they'd have is website defacement, on the grounds that the chinese wouldn't bother because there's no real reward worth paying intelligent people to spend all day working on. They might get XSS or CRLF attacks to work, as they're often considered lower priority to fix and sometimes the departments will rule that it's not worth updating software to fix it if it's going to cause other software to be incompatible with the upgraded versions. 

Another possibility would be if well-organised hacktivists somehow got hold of a list of all IPs held by those organisations, and systematically attacked them manually one by one until they found a way in. Large numbers of infrequently-used internet-facing systems held by the same organisation are often tested using automated scanning, which can miss things quite easily (and generates a lot of false positives, which sometimes results in genuine results being ignored). If they compromised a rarely-used web server on the same domain as something more important, they might have a way in.

Basically, what I'm saying is the French have a recent history of committing to large multi-nation projects (like the Eurofighter and the QE Class Carrier to name two big ones) and then backing out at later stages and perusing their own alternatives. But I just don't see their logic that their defense needs are that different to ours. In reality it seems to have more to do with the french industrial philosophy where they are far more aggressive about spending their money locally than we are here. Our governments spending plans are short-termist so if we can get an RfA tanker cheaper from South Korea than from Portsmouth or Govan, fuck Portsmouth or Govan they say. The french take the opposite approach and preferentially select their own vendors.

It's a shame because on paper the UK and French defense requirements are virtually identical - as are our spending capabilities. Yet we seem to end up with very different equipment strategies at the end.

Long before we start co-operating on EU defense, it seems like at least co-operating on procurement would be a good idea.",0,1391639747,null,0,false,0,cf80s0u,t3_1wyuty,t1_cf80s0u,t1_cf7yety,null,1435503004,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I once was on a train from Adelaide to Titanic that got delayed 30 mins, then changed to a Bangor express when it stopped at central. The conductor never came through to take fares as the train was bunged with people from two previously cancelled trains. When trying to leave, I got pulled at the gate for not having a ticket yet, even though the ticket kiosk is at the other side of the gate. Got taken in to an office. The station conductor tried to talk to me like a kid being scolded like a school principal threatening a fine and showing off to a co-worker. He said it was my fault for not finding the conductor and I should've made myself aware.I went on a full offensive gesturing for him to take the fare, correct change and all, from the hand I'd been holding it in.

When he buckled (after threatening fines, police and a lifetime ban) and let me back out to pay the fare, I asked for a ticket from Adelaide to Titanic. The ticket girl said that wasn't possible because I was in Central. Queue much 'aw now I have to pay my full fare here/ i can't cheat the system/ it wouldn't be right' from me.

And of course in the summer when we use the least amount of power it will be capable of generating the most amount of electricity....

If the pathologist thought the cannabis contributed to drowsiness that speed up him losing consciousness in a carbon monoxide rich environment, then it's a contributing factor in his death.

If the user was in a room with a CO leak, which is the rational explanation for his passing then the cannabis was inconsequential.

The ld50 of cannabis is retarded high, like a kilo of cannabis high, the two issues are simply not correlated and to subscribe the horrific and the tragic issue of CO death through faulty appliances to cannabis use is disingenuous and betrays the lives of anyone who died unjustly through carbon monoxide poisoning.

You cannot, create a fatal environment from 'hotboxing' cannabis. That entire premise is just fucking ridiculous.

Nope. Its a major problem when it comes to unreliable power sources like solar / wind etc..

The best type of storage currently In use is wind + hydro where the wind turbines pump the water back up the hill when it is not required. About 30% loss of energy doing this.

Compressed Air is about 10-40% loss of energy.

Liquid Air (Cooled) is about 30% loss of energy

Batteries is about 15-50% loss of energy

The problem isn't just about loss of energy for storage its also a question of how much can also be stored at that level of efficiently. The problem is basically scale. Here is an example.

Reservoir capacity of eight million cubic meters (2.1 billion U.S. gallons or the volume of water over Niagara Falls in 25 minutes). With a vertical distance of 600 m (1970 feet). The reservoir can provide about 13 GW·h of stored gravitational potential energy (convertible to electricity at about 80% efficiency), or about 2% of China's daily electricity consumption.

1) It would depend on the team we're playing and the way the game was progressing. Ideally I would want a Lucas-Hendo-Allen midfield as a general template. But in games where we really need a free-form style of movement (Arsenal, United, Lower half table), Coutinho should take the spot just to wreak havoc with passes and dribbles. With teams that have stronger defenders and more organized defensive lines, or with teams that we should look for counter-attacking play (Everton, Chelsea, City), I personally would go for Gerrard-Hendo-Allen. So long as Gerrard plays the way he has these past 2 days in the DM/CB position, I think it would work well. 

2) I think a 4-2-2-2 would lead to too much of a gap on the flanks and make it difficult for Flano and Cissokho to deal with pacy wingers. Our defense hasn't been bad by any means, but the defensive players have been sloppy. Personal errors are our Achilles heel and have cost us dearly.

We are the People's Club.  I want the youth players to come up and be able to start at 19 and 20 if they are quality; I want to have a team that has the feeling of a family, where players know we care about their development as footballers.  I want a team that embraces the city and lifts the spirit of the community not because they bought a winning team but because we made smart purchases and developed the youth.  I'm okay knowing we won't win the league every year because I'm not willing to sell our soul to make that happen.  We play the beautiful game with passion and tenacity and style and out work the other team because that is who we are.  I want our owner to understand this, welcome it, and never compromise.

Better instead to send players to Scottish clubs.

As /u/roobens posted below, this is more likely to be about FSG expanding their 'brand' and that, in turn, enhancing Liverpool's global 'brand'. It could also provide an opportunity to circumvent FFP in some ways; I don't think it will work the way /u/roobens suggested it will, but in City's most recent accounts, they listed 'intellectual property', referring to their NYRB and Melbourne Heart 'franchises' as an income source.
