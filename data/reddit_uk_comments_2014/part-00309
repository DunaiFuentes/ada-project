Good work, that was the best possible response. Remember as well that if you do get nervous or stressed or angry, pull over and clear your head.

You are going to be riding in an urban environment, likely in the wet (Go UK!). Watch out for sewer grates, white lines and other road ""dressing."" They can often be very slippery in the wet, again, take your time, ride smoothly and you will be fine.

There is one other thing. When you do venture out onto the bigger A-roads keep your speed up! So many new riders, or riders on smaller bikes, 50, 125 or 250cc are not acclimatised to high speed, and some of their bikes struggle to hit 60 mph, let alone the speeds that many cars will be driving at! Keeping your speed up to at least 60mph (assuming an open road and flowing traffic) means you won't have cars passing you at almost twice your speed, which can be damn scary! Many nervous riders in this situation let themselves be pushed to the left by their fear of the overtaking vehicles, which places them in a situation where cars are overtaking at 30 or 40 mph faster, but also not really changing lanes to do it!",0,1413585891,null,0,false,0,clch37b,t3_2jj4fh,t1_clch37b,t1_clcgiv9,null,1426475983,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2

If you are 17+, with a CBT including geared training you are limited by the power output allowed on your bike (11kw). But have no licence restriction on speed.

false,Dysphemistically,eng-durham,"Teesside, unfortunately","I agree, it is wrong to cause harm to someone without their consent in any form, be it genital or otherwise and I do not think you will find ANYONE in this sub who is claiming otherwise.

This is a conversation about female genital mutilation and you feel the need to adamantly insist that we also discuss male circumcision.

Can I ask why? Do you think there is a competition? Do you not understand how irksome it is that no conversation can be had about a gender related topic without someone saying ""but men suffer too""? Do you think the people against FGM are all for MGM?

Incidentally, MGM is, culturally, done as either a right of passage or in celebration of the male body and men's place within a culture. Outside of circumcision penile mutilation is nowhere near as frequent in this country as FGM is. I think you know this, I also think that you read the wikipedia article you linked further down and viewed the part that listed the (very small) ethnic groups that practise penile subincision. 

The groups that practise FGM are much more numerous and extend to entire countries instead of ethnic groups within a country. I think you know this because you are not stupid. 

That is not to say that having your penis cut in half isn't horrific, but the majority of FGM is severe and involves the removal or partial removal of the clitoris and is done to enirely subjugate a woman's ability to feel pleasure from the sex act. For men the majority of genital mutilation is circumsicion. 

The problem I have is this: you, or someone like you, come to threads to this and insist that we talk about men as well. I understand that there is only one pot of money, there is only so much attention and political and media will that go behind a campaign for something like this and women get a lot more exposure than men do, whilst both suffer. I understand this and emphasise. But when you or your ilk come to a thread and insist that we can't just have a discussion about women, we have to have a discussion about men all people can see is another man jumping up and down saying, ""Why are we talking about women things? Men things are much more important.""

Domestic abuse effects men as well as women, but women get a lot more money and media exposure. Reality and statistics suggest that women suffer more extreme consequences of domestic abuse, but men still suffer and should be catered for. The difference is rarely do topics of conversation about how men are abused and suffering end in a woman insisting we talk about women being abused because it's not getting enough attention. Any reasonable person would simply think that any abuse is abhorrent.

I know you know all this, so please understand I'm not trying to give offense, I'm just tired of being unable to have an adult discussion about an issue effecting women without someone interrupting about how men are so underrepresented.",0,1413587610,null,0,false,0,clchu1o,t3_2ji23e,t1_clchu1o,t1_clcfdhy,null,1426475634,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I'd personally prefer to have the Â£25 million from Warrior and let them do the merchandising, especially since the revenue potential isn't affected by on-pitch success during the duration of the deal, as it is when you are getting merchandising profits directly.

Not sure about the others, but I'd imagine big makers like Adidas, Nike and Puma would not be willing to give up all merchandise rights except for official training gear and shirt sales.

It's a quirk of the binary nature of a verdict and the jury's ability to reach a verdict however they want to without consequence. It's an implicit consequence of how the current system works rather than some explicit right conferred to juries but kept secret by the courts, and it works both ways.

The old example often given is a racist jury lets off a white man killing a black man even though he is obviously guilty, or the same kind of thing where they convict a black man on flimsy/no evidence just because he is black.

But obviously it can be used for good in cases where the public interest in prosecuting someone is clearly not there, a good example of that is a jury not finding someone killing a terminally ill or suffering spouse guilty of murder.",0,1413588447,null,0,false,0,clci6tc,t3_2jjl78,t1_clci6tc,t1_clcfhk7,null,1426475470,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

It's more that I don't feel the beliefs of one individual should result in any forced action upon another - particularly an infant with no concept of religion or culture and certainly no desire to practice it. 

Who is *anyone* to force that upon someone? 

And if we decide it's OK to force it upon someone then surely FGM and elf ears and tattooing your child green must all be OK provided they're done in the name of something you strongly believe in on a religious level.

My ""issue"" with Skrtel is his inconsistency. He seems, from my perspective at least, to be either amazing or awful. Sometimes within the same game. Good Skrtel is our best, but I never feel safe with him. 

Lovren is a joint 2nd because at this point he's had a shaky start but shows some good qualities, leadership and pace come to mind.

Anfield Cat has scored 0 OGs and assisted 0 WBA goals so is naturally above Kolo.

I rank Sakho top because he is aerially dominant, and even when Ba was beating him last year in the air he stopped challenging and won ever second ball. His passing stats are generally high, upwards of 90% completion. I like a ""front foot"" defender. Also, he makes good forward passes. He has hit some beauties which have cut the midfield out completely and would work well with our counter attacking style.

While I agree he hasn't been amazing for us so far; I feel he hasn't had a proper run at it. Injuries took a lot of last season from him, and why he was dropped Vs Everton I will never know. for France he is a monster. I know we leave our CBs exposed more than they do but there is no way France Sakho cant appear for us.

That being said, Skrtel looked a beast vs Spain. Maybe its our play style, or defensive coaching. If we could have the Skrtel and Sakho who both put Costa is their back pockets internationally then we'd do a lot better.

To be honest, this is all my opinion. I am a bit of a Sakho fan boy, have been for some time pre-LFC. I was very happy when we signed him and hope things pick up for him. He and Lovren are 24 and 25 so can be a partnership for the next 5/6 years potentially, unless ofc Ilori dethrones one. Who knows.

I said this before but you glossed over it, so I'll say it again, MGM is a cultural practise, no matter how abhorrent, done as a confirmation of the male body and a right of passage. It is part of a culture that prises masculinity.

FGM is done to subjugate women and their sexuality to male dominated cultures. 

You say you want to talk about both, but this particular topic is about women. Why do you feel the need to hijack that? 

Similarly one can't have a conversation about women being raped without *someone* saying men get raped too. We all know that, no one is denying it, but why can't we just have, for once, a gods damned discussion without it being hijacked. Can't talk about women being portrayed as sex objects in the gaming industry without ""sometimes men have stupid looking armour too"".

Negatives; Warnock looked like he has lost his spark, but I'm glad he's back in the match day squad, will re-evaluate after the next game. But he's had a tremendous start to the season.

Doukara; had a poor game and should have come off a lot earlier.

Final ball ffs; it was either a player missing the running man or taking it too far that a final ball couldn't be played, Antenucci was guilty of this all night despite his goal. He went left every single time and was drawn out of the play.

Officials; the last 6 minutes was a fucking joke. No one wants to watch that shit. 

Awareness; maybe it's a language barrier but on so many occasions players were not looking at the space around/weren't being told by teammates that they had plenty of space in which to hold the ball up or take a touch. The same can also be said for players passing the ball into channels where there was never going to be any space, Doukara did this on several occasions. 

Rotherham manager can sweat

Positives;

Adryan got about 25 minutes and showed his potential, he has a deft touch and sort of glides with the ball. His yellow card shows that he isn't just going to be that quiet player we thought he might've been. 

Movement was generally good, passing was 'ok' but some real woeful attempts brought the level down.

When Silvestri went down Bellucsi was straight in at Revell, I like a defender who shows what he's made off, but that dodgy touch which nearly allowed their 3rd was diabolical. 

Can't think of anymore, really quite drunk here! Apologies for formatting/spelling/grammar. On mobile.

I'm from 'Sconsin (Go Pack Go). I'm a student and study English linguistics and German language. I like it for the most part. I'm considering going to graduate school for linguistics, but I'm not the best at school. 

Music: Pretty wide variety. Favorites are They Might Be Giants, The Clash, Kanye West, Kendrick Lamar. My most recent obsessions are Stromae and Vampire Weekend. 

Movies: My favorite is The Graduate. Also anything directed by Jason Reitman. 

Shows: Don't really watch TV. Comedy mostly. SNL, Parks and Rec, South Park, and Key &amp; Peele are the only shows I watch religiously. I also love Seinfeld, 30 Rock, and the Office. 

Books: Pretty much all the ones they make you read in school. To Kill a Mockingbird, The Catcher in the Rye, and All Quiet on the Western Front are probably my favorites.

If ratings &amp; viewership numbers were to slip because fans are watching shows on other sources outside of the BBC's control, there could be a day when the BBC considers changing or even canceling said show due to misinformation. I don't know about you but I love QI the way it is, and I want to see it go all the way to Z and beyond! Therefore I'll show them that they've got a viewer they can count on week after week. Plus like I said it's by far the best quality, and still commercial free, quickly &amp; easily accessed. 

I see what your saying about putting strain on BBC's servers, but I wouldn't worry. As much as we love QI there are more popular shows where that may be an issue (i.e. Top Gear), but I doubt that's an issue with QI's audience. If an elf pops in here and tells me I'm wrong about this part then I'll gladly eat my words and change my stance on the issue.

Just that the UK players/teams don't qualify for any of the major tournaments.

I feel for pro gaming to be a viable career path, they either need to be in a country with a low cost of living and so it's more viable. Or they have to be wealthy enough that they can be supported by their family till they are noticed.

I feel the UK is too much in the middle between these 2 extremes. So it doesn't really foster a strong potential for growth. Example being, that Dendi and the other guys on Na'Vi were reported to make $2,000-ish a month. That's great for someone living in the Ukraine, because their cost of living (rent and food etc) is much lower. Someone in the UK earning the same, would not be so comfortable.

And in the US, many of the players in the early stages of their careers are entirely supported by their middle-upper class families. Big events like TI and ESL-One are legitimizing it, so they are now making serious sponsorship money that they can then make a living off of it. 

In the UK, sadly we don't have as strong a gaming culture... And we don't treat Pro-gaming with as much respect as other cultures around the world. So the UK players/teams struggle to find support and sponsorship that can sustain them in our economy. 

TL:DR There won't be a UK team at a TI or ESL-One event until the environment in the UK becomes more friendly to pro-gaming.

Costa for Spain is a completely different striker than Costa for Chelsea. Chelsea is pretty much the quintessential Diego Costa team. Diego Costa left Simeone's Atletico Madrid which is a Chelsea with possibly a better coach but less than half the talent. The only reason last year's Chelsea sucked was because they didn't have a Costa. But even though they sucked, they were a stable top 4 team last season. And so the addition of Fabregas, Matic (champions league), Courtois, Costa, and Luis Filipe into their squad has made them the most dominant team in England and could possibly win UCL with this team.

In terms of our defense, I think we need to punish more and replace Gerrard. Our defense is talented but awfully inconsistent. We don't have anyone who can defend consistently for 90 minutes. I think that's all it really is right now. People are trying to over analyze whatever is going on but in truth it's that we have yet to see one of them focus for an entire 90 minutes. Sure, they have these spurts where they'll dominate for a while. But eventually we'll start seeing them get broken down. And eventually they let one slip. And unfortunately we're not last year's team. So we can't make up for in front what we lack in the back. And since we're so dead in the front, we're letting people slip in the back. We saw that against Ludogoretz, where we honestly just lucked out against a goalkeeper who doesn't really play professionally, actually put in a great performance, but ended up making a huge mistake in the end on Manquillo lol.

Of course the 'pc gone mad' brigade wants to portray this as an issue of problematic pc, doesn't mean it is. And of course the 'muslims get a free pass' rubbish also wants to be applied. None of what this statement says has been proved, it's pure conjecture politically motivated. 

&gt;while social workers will hesitate to intervene in any case in which they could be accused of discriminating against ethnic minorities.

if you're talking about the recent case that's been hitting the media headlines non-stop, then why would this be a case of racism? The victims were mostly non-whites anyway. Of course in this case the media has cared very little about the victims of the crimes, instead preferring to attach whole sets of cultural, national and racial motives to the rapists. Such an implication without the fact amounts to a double racism: the idea that non-whites only act on cultural or religious grounds and have no individual agency themselves, and also that any case of non-white rape cannot be attributed to simply bad individuals but rather must say something more about the nature of a collective as a people. 

I really don't expect much from the mainstream media which is incredible racist already, usually without knowing it. As for the 'Islamophobia' trope, that just disgusting. If the kind of crimes committed against muslims in this country where committed against white christians, there would have been a national outcry and would be dominated the headlines, but it doesn't. So bomb attacks on mosques, the storming of mosques by 'Britain First' thugs, the massive increases in violence against muslims remains pages deep in the newspapers is recorded at all. And to then invert that and say 'Islamophobia' is caused by other muslims is to go beyond the pale; the EDL and soldiers planting pipe bombs are the fault of other Muslims ('militant' ones), of course those people have no agency themselves and cannot be blamed or held responsible for their acts and crimes. Such an idea is just apologism for racism, much like much of this narrative which - let's not ignore - is really to say the cause of anti-racism has gone to far, an idea originating from old white men in the press and society getting annoyed that they cannot say their reactionary views without being called a racist.

yeah because we certainly don't have toilets for different genders. I take it you've never heard of gender neutral toilets. Of course in our great country we care little about transgender people, to busy proclaiming our superiority over the backwards Africans

&gt;forcing your kids to marry

Force entails a multitude of practices many of which aren't immediately obvious. We certainly force our children to do lots of things they certainly wouldn't want to do. Enforcing gender binaries on children for example is perhaps one of the most brutal impositions possible; children feel no longer at home in their own bodies. But of course someone who's been told they're a boy but decides to wear a skirt or clothing assigned a particular gender can expect to be laugh at, jeered at, told off by parents and teachers alike and rejected by society. Very few things are so mentally scaring as that and it happens all the time so as to appear the norm.

They can even custom tailor the room to boost the recovery or increase the performance of individual players. sleeping in an altitude chamber increases red blood cells which is important for endurance and strength gains. 

Good rest is very important, along with nutrition. Sleeping in the hotel will give the scientists ability to monitor sleep patterns and gather data on recovery rate of players. 

These sort of cost is not really justified for small clubs as the gains are minimal.. but for elite clubs this could be the difference between winning a title or not.

He looked good pushing up at the end of the last game at least. Sterling and Lallana both have superb dribbling skills, but with Gerrard there I feel like there will be less focus on just trying to dribble through 3 players and more thought to one touch or killer passes. Though they are all brilliant, sometimes they overdo it trying to take on too many players instead of laying it off once the defenders are disorganised. I actually think both Balotelli and Sterling would benefit from having the experience and passing skills of Gerrard in close proximity. Henderson has the talent, but I think we're wasting what's left of Gerrard's talent by just solely using him for perfectly placed long balls from deep and his massive defensive duties, though he is one of the best distributors in the game.

Description | Amount
:--- | ---:
combined income before tax per annum | Â£60,000
combined income after tax per annum | Â£40,000
current rent at Â£1,000/mth | Â£12,000
current bills at Â£250/mth | Â£3,000
current commute at Â£350/mth x 2 | Â£8,400
maximum savings per annum | Â£16,600

So you could save Â£16,600 a year. What kind of deposit would you need for a Â£800,000 property? Well let's assume you need a standard 20% deposit to avoid mortgage insurance which I'd imagine was sizeable for such a property. Twenty percent of Â£800,000 is Â£160,000.

It would take you 10 years, saving at Â£16,600 a year, to save the required deposit of Â£160,000.

Now let's consider what the payments on an Â£640,000 mortgage would be (80% of Â£800k). At a mere 3.5% interest (good luck with that) your repayments would be Â£3,711.74 *every month*. Are you sure you could afford that?

Don't forget all your home insurances would be much higher. And stamp duty is the killer. The stamp duty on a Â£800,000 home is Â£32,000! You can't put stamp duty into a mortgage - you have to pay it in cash when buying a home. So you're going to have to save for *two more years* just to afford the stamp duty.

So, all told, a 20% mortgage and stamp duty for a Â£800,000 home will take you and your partner 12 years to save assuming you're both earning ~Â£30,000/year.

&gt; I was irked by one thing- the tendency of some people to automatically insert something along the lines of ""but it happens to men as well"" in a conversation about women.

But you're unable to deny that genital mutilation occurs in both sexes and continue to side step my very simple assertion that it's possible to send a message covering *both* sexes: *Genital Mutilation is wrong.* - Rather than breaking it down by sex. 

Perhaps you're unwilling or unable to find space for that notion in your world view, but nobody - not one person here - has been able to tell me how that simple statement would in any way damage men or women. 

Perhaps you can tell me? Are people so small minded they're unable to hold an idea in their heads that covers both sexes? Is it too complicated? 

I'd be genuinely keen to see why such a simple statement is proving so hard to swallow - you've already admitted that MGM is not OK, so surely stopping both is of importance and since both cover the mutilation of the genitals of infants - the message to do *neither* is easily made and understood?

I'm starting to get the impression that either there's an agenda at work that views men's rights as lesser than women's in this instance (?) or the only other logical conclusion I can think of is that the simple statement is too difficult for you to comprehend?

In a frying pan fry some onion and carrots until browned and then place into a slow cooker, then add a little but of oil and add around 500g of beef cut into chunks in batches so they get a decent colour onto them, season with salt and pepper. Remove and place into the slow cooker. Now you take a bottle of ale, the darker the better here none of these fancy IPA's here and de glaze the pan with the beer and add some stock.

Pour over the mix in the slow cooker and cook on low for 3 or 4 hours. You can do this on the stove on low in a heavy pan.

Check the beef from time to time, give it a stir when it is tender leave it to cool (I did this overnight)

Cook some spuds and leave to cool.

Make or buy pastry I made shortcrust using equal parts fat and plain flour with a little salt and water to bind (I went for butter and lard 70% butter 30% lard) roll it out and line the pie dish, then place the beef and spuds into the pastry with some of the gravy, cover with more pastry and apply an egg wash.

Put in oven at 180 degrees until the top is golden.

It's called collective bargaining with a union. While unions can sometimes strike over ridiculous things they are there primarily to stop employers taking the piss out of their staff.

A strike is the only 'nuclear' option employees have if they think they are being treated unfairly. They aren't striking to put you out, it's to try and make the employer back down. 

Each individual situation is different, sometimes they are in the right, sometimes they aren't.

I take the tube every day and I'm not overly concerned with the odd strike once in a blue moon if it helps better working conditions for thousands of people. It's just a shame in other industries in the UK employees are treated like shit because they aren't unionised.

I'm not sure how it would work in this case - it strikes me that Vodafone are in a stronger position if they don't take him to court:

 - They can set debt collectors on him. 
 - They can put a default against his credit rating.
 - They can hassle him more-or-less forever.

Whereas if they take him to court, it'd be a civil claim on the balance of probabilities. He just has to say ""I called them up, they told me to call when I was back in the UK with my IMEI"" and Vodafone - who have no evidence to the contrary - may well be told by a judge to fuck off.

But no one seems to have picked up on your idea of moving 6 times in 6 years to get to it.

Unless you're both going to double your income in the next 6 years, and put away about Â£10k a year as a deposit, you still won't be anywhere near affording it.

I'll assume you're quite young (mid to late 20s?). You don't start up in a 5 bed detached in a nice suburb of London unless Mum and Dad buy you it. You start in a flat in a not-so-nice area and work your way up as your pay rises allow you to. This may take 10 years and you move 3 or 4 times in that, it may take 40 and you move 15 times. It depends on a lot of things - pay rises, credit score, luck with house price rises, whether you get a sizeable inheritance to put towards it, etc. You also have to think your priorities might change. If you want a family then you obviously need a bigger house, good schools, etc. Maybe you've already thought of that and that's why you like this house, I don't know. 

The one thing you may be interested in looking at is help-to-buy. You only need a 5% deposit (I believe) and I'm fairly sure the government underwrites the mortgage so lenders may be more willing to lend, and there are some nice houses available on the scheme, at least in the area I live.

If the way you'd been driving was highly likely to have caused a crash if there was a car there, and you've got no way of knowing whether a car is there or not (e.g. bombing round a blind corner on the wrong side of the road), is it right that you manage to escape serious punishment simply because you were lucky and there wasn't a car coming the other way?

What I found most unpleasant about the whole experience was the worry I felt for the bloke I hit. Not the being threatened, backed into a corner or having someone's hands on my neck. I was seriously worried the bloke I hit was seriously hurt because of how he went to the floor.

Yeah, you've just pulled that number out of you arse. The answer is nobody knows because it isn't thought of as important enough to research. Ritual MGM (not in a western hospital, [but outside with ritual tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK6UXwrRu34&amp;t=2m20s)) of many types happens to millions of boys a year. Far more that FGM happens at all. Of those, there are complications in thousands of cases ranging from the inability to have sex over to a total penectomy. This is thought to happen to several hundred thousand a year but nobody knows the exact number. Death during circumcision is thought to happen to around 500 boys a year but it is thought that it could be *much* higher.

&gt;But of course we should never spend more money on women than men even if it actually matters a lot more.

I agree but thats often not the case. Take for example domestic violence. About 50% of domestic abuse victims are men. And before you say it's often worse for women because men are stronger: A third of domestic abuse victims that are hospitalised from the violence are men and 40% or murders from domestic abuse are men. 

Regarding were the money goes, there are 7,500 refuge places for battered women in the UK and 60 for men. A ratio of 125:1 versus 2:1 for the actual difference in prevalence.

I camped there in spring with my brother. Bear with me a few moments. Also realised there're only 86 of us here, no problem giving you directions on here.

Okay, so, generally when I go wild camping I like to camp near a water source. I think it's prettier and it usually allows access for washing etc. This time, however, we were in a rush as night was falling.

https://goo.gl/maps/qq0sp

I parked my car up there, and walked up the path. I think the path is used for forestry work, horses, and I'm sure the land is private. I would recommend exercising caution, and considering you're on BushcraftUK you know to practice leave no trace. We saw a lady trot past on her horse with her dogs in tow and look reasonably interested, but we didn't hear anything else. We only ever camp from PM to early AM so if anyone had a problem with us being there we didn't hear about it. We are always ready to feign ignorance and move on at someone's first request - we actually got asked to move on while camping in the lake district, but the bloke who asked us to leave commended us on our tidiness and respect for nature!

The woodland there is very dark, and it's all covered in a layer of moss, so be very careful when lighting a fire. I dug a big, big hole and cleared the area around it to make sure.

The place we camped was beautiful, very dark in the woodland, quite eerie, but right on the edge of the moors with big sweeping views out onto the red and orange and brown moorland. I'll see if I can find some pictures.

All in all, out of the places I've wild camped in England, Dartmoor has been the least 'interesting', but funnily it's the only national park in england where wild camping is actually allowed.

I love to workout.I was going to the gym, but now I am more of a street workout.

I speak three language, including Macedonian,which is my native language.Also German.And I am still learning French and Italian.

I'll admit I don't know much about this type of philosophy...but we're social animals and a large part of the punishment of the offender is to provide comfort and a sense of justice for the victim. In the case of the lamp post, there is no significant victim.

Perhaps the offense should be one of not driving defensively. That is, not driving in a manner that minimises unwanted outcomes, be it to a lamp post or a child.

There's no reason to assume that a certain *offense by itself* should incur a certain punishment....perhaps it's more reasonable to hold that a certain *outcome of an offence* should incur a certain punishment.

Yes, we need to investigate the cause of this *far* higher propensity for child abuse amongst Asians.

First of all, it should be understood that it isn't all Asians who have this higher propensity, but South Asians specifically, I suspect it's a cultural issue, in that certain cultures inherent to the South Asian community encourage or are simply lenient towards child abuse, especially when it's done to girls who are ""outside"" their community, IE white girls.",0,1413632090,null,0,1413632289,0,clcu022,t3_2jllka,t1_clcu022,t1_clctyd4,null,1426469820,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

So in total, 6 hours of class time. They make up for the short class time by giving you a large reading load.  
    There is not much homework, which is nice, but its very important to do the core readings because grades are based almost entirely on essays. Around two per class. The lectures themselves are essentially to solidify what you have read and the seminars are used to debate and argue. The professors seem a little distant, but I'm just used to a very small school.

I'm not sure about the ""care"" part, but they are doing something about it by increasing the minimum wage every year and not increasing the working age benefits at the same rate. This means that more and more people get a pay rise every year that reduces the amount of working age benefits they receive.

If they changed the minimum wage right now to Â£9 an hour it would take a hell of a lot of people off working tax credit. The problem is that they can't make that jump too fast because of the knock on effect it would have. The increase has to be done slowly, which it already is, just not quite fast as many people would like.

The problem we have with the welfare bill is that some of the most expensive parts of it ([pensions and disability living allowance](http://i.imgur.com/QeB520t.jpg)) are not means tested.

Benefits are supposed to be a safety net for the poor, not holiday money for the people who don't need it. And just because you *can* claim for something, doesn't mean you *should*. The citation here being every company who ever legally avoided paying tax.

But the government don't want to put focus on the benefits bill that actually matters, because the people it affects vote far more often. It's easier to attack young people because a large amount of them are politically apathetic. Even a lot of 30-50 year olds fall foul of the propaganda and blame young people and immigrants and think that they're taking all the benefits.

No it doesn't. Cannabis is neurogenetic -- it does the **opposite**. It actually creates brain cells, in a similar way to how SSRI's do.

&gt; it is unhealthy

Only when smoked, and the main reasons for it being more unhealthy than it would be is **because it is illegal**.

&gt; when smoked, it may cause lung cancer

No research has ever proven this, and there hasn't been a single case of someone having black lungs from only smoking cannabis. Let's not forget that cannabis is used to **kill cancer cells**.

Your home network can block the SIM altogether - which is exactly what happened here, Vodafone have anti-fraud systems in place to do just that - but it cannot block it the instant it starts racking up silly money because the home network does not know the instant it starts racking up silly money.

PAYG uses a totally different mechanism called CAMEL - that does allow for real-time call reporting; it was invented because without such a process, you couldn't operate a PAYG system of any sort. But pay monthly doesn't have to use that at all, at least not for voice calls - and by the sound of things, still doesn't, for Vodafone at least.

The downvotes just prove people have their heads up their arses over the Problem. Let me just spell it out for you:

Paedophillia can never be cured. Many pretend they are cured but they are not. They choose this sick perversion and once they do so they can never go back, ever. They are a cancer of society that have infected every community, organisation, religion, group and government. Despite the illusion that paedophillia is being punished paedophiles in the system make life easy for paedophiles. They're protected in the prisons, once released they are protected in society and allowed to come back into the paedophile world. Cultures all over the world have been manipulated to celebrate paedophillia with topless 16 year olds in our papers and sexualised children openly displayed everywhere. People are only talking about the Rotherham scandal because we can call it an ""Asian"" or ""Muslim"" problem. It's not, we're just ignoring the fact it's a worldwide problem, a worldwide conspiracy. Just using the ""C"" word may discredit what I just said, but there is nothing else that can describe it.

They are in *every* party and government that have ever had a taste in power. Even now, when a paedophile is revealed, the name of the childfuckers are hidden from us. They are in every religion, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism. The only way to solve this is to stop looking at the individual cases and go after the childfuckers as a whole. They are not human, always remember that. They don't feel anything for their victims, not even lust. They see every child like you would a sex doll. Their whole lives exist for one thing alone: to rape children. The Police won't do anything, the Government won't do anything, businesses won't do anything, they have been infected with paedophillia.

The refereeing was an absolute joke, of the American Horror Story rather than George Carlin variety.  The scoreline should have been much more comfortable but all those penalties took the wind out of our sails at the worst possible time.

Great work from Hugo, Eriksen, Rose, Soldado, Mason.  Some real positives to take from this match.  On the other side of the coin, I'm disappointed in Lamela, Kaboul, Fazio in particular.  Not sure I'd change anything in the line-up except that Jan should've been on the field from the start.

We play Newcastle in 8 days.  Ignore the scoreline, build on green shoots from this match, and we can dominate.

I might get stick for this - but I applauded his first and fourth goals. Absolutely crazy how he managed to find that space for the first one and that finish with his weak foot for the fourth one was crazy. He's an incredible player and had one of the games of his life - so there's nothing that any team could have done about that.

* Now about us. Soldado up front was very good before Fazio got sent off. He had some fantastic chemistry with Chadli and Lamela and he needs to be given game time to make something of it. I kept thinking that if Ade had been there, he would have slowed play down, tried to hold up the ball, tried to prove something by going up against Kompany. But Soldado was very slick and fluid and he really needs some game time. Not Ade or Kane, but Bobby.

* Fazio was very good. Yes it was a silly penalty to give away, but apart from that he was great in the back line, his passes were accurate, he played a very measured game and I think him and Vertonghen need to be given a run out.

* We were great in possession, passed the ball very well and played a good game - this was a very positive performance but when Aguero + Hart are in the form of their life and playing a crazy good game, you can't do much.

Whilst Psychobilin is not novel, by any strech. If we are having a dicusion about 'well can our countries drug policy be less fucked and framed around public health concerns (as it should be)' then I have and continue to propose for this particular drug, decriminalization only.

Drugs that are good candidates for recreational and wide spread should have minimal health risks (both psychologically and psychologically), relatively short action times and carry a low risk of inducing harm to others (do they promote risky or violent behavior). Things which are bad in all these regards are what I mean by 'liability'. 

We don't need people causing themselves or others harm and being in a state for a extended period of time because of the negative externalities incurred. 

Unfortunately Psycobilin whilst daily mail scare stories aside dose ok on the first (not null though), its got a long action time and impairs judgement to the point that it carries a fair risk of harm to others (not as bad as Alcohol of PCP though obviously).

So again, whilst interdiction is a pointless waste of time and money, wide spread adoption *is* something we'd want to avoid. Thus, simply decriminalizing whilst preventing large scale distribution and sale seems to be the best route. 

If people want to go out of their way to get hold of it, fine. Taking measures to stop that is just a waste of resources. But a world in which it becomes as popular as THC or Alcohol *is* somethnig we should avoid.",0,1413640312,null,0,1413640549,0,clcvrzk,t3_2jj960,t1_clcvrzk,t1_clcvmg0,null,1426468960,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

false,[deleted],null,null,"Here's the difference between Murder and Paedophilia:

99% of murders are spur of the moment things, the evil, super genius killers you find now and again don't exist in reality. They aren't planned, they are often done in moments of blindness where the judgement of the murderer is blurred. A bank robber only uses the gun as a way to convince a teller to hand the money over, only a stupid bank robber would go into a bank, get what they wanted and kill someone anyway. Even when the teller says ""No"" they don't want to use the gun.

100% of cases of Childrape are planned. All of them. To gain access to children and not get caught the paedophile has to go out of it's way to get access to children. They have to drive to a school, they have to gain the trust of a parent or guardian, they have to work with other childfuckers to gain access to children. Childfuckers have to plan, they have *no* choice if they want to rape kids. These Asians are an example of this, they used the gulf in their communities with the whites in the area to rape children. They were organised. Jimmy Saville too was organised. He got away with his plans right under our noses. He even showed off his methods on camera on national TV, showing off this land rover with a mattress in it so he could rape children in the remotest of locations. He gained access to vulnerable children through charity work. He worked with other paedophiles to rape children. This wasn't some dumb opportunist, he was a smart man who was a member of MENSA. They are organised, they are plotting. The death penalty was made for people who actively plot out horrific, sickening crimes. Prison doesn't work for paedophiles, only death will work.",0,1413641089,null,0,false,0,clcvzxr,t3_2jllka,t1_clcvzxr,t1_clcvmwo,null,1426468856,-11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-11

Finally, I agree that Soldado looked better today than he has all season. Unfortunately, that isn't saying much. Yeah, his passing was good and he at least tried to hold the ball up, but seriously, those are things Kane does just as well, and Kane has the added bonus of actually scoring.

false,fredisa4letterword,null,null,"Well, my thoughts:

Our first half was pretty good, and we were unlucky to be down 2-1. The first penalty was utter bs. The first City goal there was a legitimate shout for offside. We still put one away and had other good chances... I'm sure Mason is ruing that miss.

The second half though... really poor penalty and deserved red card from Fazio. We're already down at that point, but conceding that penalty effectively ended the game. Better to have just conceded the goal then given the penalty. I was looking the other way so I missed the long ball that led to that penalty, but I assume Rose is at fault there.

The free kick happened so fast, but it really brings home the point that our defenders are just too slow to play a high line, especially against a team with so much speed. It's so obvious and has been for so long, I don't know what else to say about it. 

Lamela did give away the ball leading to the first goal, but he didn't really have possession. He could have done better, but he was put in an awkward position. The penalty as I said was BS. Besides that, in the first half, he seemed solid on the ball, beat defenders, made good passes. He made a great run that led to Mason's chance. He did start giving away the ball poorly in the second half, and was rightly subbed for Andros.

I liked what I saw from Townsend... down to 10 men, he tracked back, but gave us our only chances at consolation goals. I know people don't like his shooting record, but he was pretty isolated and he'll come good eventually. Townsend can be a super sub; be brings such energy to our attack late in the game. Obviously it's his decision making that needs improvement, but I didn't see anything bad from him today.

Mason is the real deal IMO. I really think he deserves the gametime he's been getting. A little reckless but playing with confidence.

Kaboul: such a weak start, and we all must have known that Aguero would turn him inside out a couple times. For as good as he was against the scum, he was that poor against City today. I don't want to be too harsh, but that's how I feel about it. Having said that, I don't think playing Jan in his place would have been much better.

Capoue was solid afaicr. He seemed to have a lot of defensive responsibilities and didn't embarrass himself.

Rose had an ok game, but he gets caught out of position; you would have figured that he'd been instructed to be more conservative going forward. He had some good crosses though.

I'd say Dier played well; didn't get embarrassed in defense as far as I can remember, which is better than you can say about any of our other defenders.

Bobby had a great game, with an asterisk being the penalty miss. It was a good save, but he could have done better and we needed a goal.

Chadli looked ok. Earned some free kicks in good places.

MOTM between Hugo and Eriksen... Eriksen for the goal and a solid overall game, Hugo for making some pretty good saves... tough to get MOTM when you concede four goals though.

Anyway, this IS an improvement over this fixture from last year... especially in our first half form. Let's as fans take some positives from this game, and try to ignore the amount of shit we will get for capitulating again.",0,1413641292,null,0,false,0,clcw23x,t3_2jltjg,t1_clcw23x,t3_2jltjg,null,1426468829,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

Did you not read my post? The fact that 75% of the known abusers were Asian and 82% of the victims were white just *proves* my point. These paedophiles used the racial environment of the area to organise a child rape organisation. However, saying ""75% of all childfuckers known to the police are Asian, therefore there are no White or black childfuckers"" isn't a good idea. The reason why 75% of Childfuckers in the West Midlands are Asian is because they could get away with it and grow their numbers. If you have a Childfucker ring that only recruited certain people for a certain reason, would you be surprised that a big number of those childfuckers are from that group?

couple of genuine positives to be taken from the first hour or so of this match. 

- soldado looked sharp at times, if rusty at others - certainly enough to reinvigorate poch and fans' interest/faith, if it was waning. that front four had a nice look to it. 
- mason is an exciting prospect in midfield. we've played him deep but he loves getting box to box. priority in his development is to reel in all those wayward passes. 

a well-made point, but i'll repeat it 

- haven't got much patience for lamela's body language after a cock-up. i love seeing an attacking player chase back after they lose possession. can't stand when they make a choice to express frustration instead of doing this.

I love Kenyans, but strongly dislike and distrust Nigerians.
(this is because the Nigerians are well known for deceiving people and stealing.
Kenyans are lovely people I have a lot of reselect for them, and I find them very honest.

I Have no problems with the Chinese. In fact I like them. their culture is amazing, I often wonder how they will view us in the future though (in western Europe) we provided demand for manufactured goods which gave them jobs, but I have hear that working in a factory in China is worse than living off the land so I don't know if they will be angry with us in future. As general people I have no problems with them though. In England where I live, they are always quite and never cause trouble. (I only wish I could speak with them more).

Pakistanis are the worlds shit producers though. They claim they own England now, and this is their country. (I have actually had a paki shop owner tell me that. I was going to break his windows in retaliation (but i never did). I never liked them offering me African prostitutes for Â£10 in my own garden, and I have never liked this shitty attitude they have to local people. obviously that should be enough to cause trouble.

No one will do anything though as you can be arrested for that.

Americans.. hmm.. loud mouth fuckers, but I don;t see many of them.
The Polish don't want to know us and think England owes them something. (even though we declared war on Germany when Poland got invaded.

French are just French, we have loved and hated them 1000 times in the last 1000 years. I don;t suppose we love or hate them. but we have so much history that we really don't care either.

Other than that I have no other problems, at least not related to race.
(I personally think the Spanish are still pissed off when we sunk the Spanish armada. (would surprise me if they had something to do with the Titanic. but that's just harsh speculation I suppose.

Oh, out of 20 Roma gypsies I have met, I can say that only one of them as remotely honest. and he never tried to steal from me.
As it happens though he did ask my to help stage a crash for cash scheme, and obviously I was horrified at the idea, and never spoke with him since.

So, there you have it. I don;t hate anyone because of their skin colour. I hate them because of our relations,and their traits.

So, It does beg the question.... Am I actually really racist? or is it that I'm just simply honest? I'm not hating anybody because of their race. but more rather than their shitty and sub-respectably attitudes and behaviours against the British people, and also myself?

Oh one more thing that makes me a possible racist however, is that I hate it when low life foreign scum actually claim they are British. That is the worst annoying thing to me!

Essentially I've got no problem with the current rate, but I certainly don't believe it should be lowered or scrapped, maybe bring in some tiers?

Apparently its Â£325,000, the threshold, doubled for couples.  So, theoretically, if my mother dies, my father can keep the house worth Â£450,000 right? But when he dies, and the assets are passed onto the next of kin, we'll get hit for anything over Â£325,000? 

But, if we want to make it fairer, perhaps lower the rate at Â£325,000, then increase it at Â£500,000 by say 10%, and then again at Â£1m, Â£2m, Â£5m and perhaps even higher.

In exactly the same way that the vast majority of groomers are men does not mean that men as a whole are at fault and should be kept under constant watch and suspicion of being a pedo.

The actual way to solve this is to investigate the crimes and the reasons why it is happening, maybe it is cultural in these men. I don't know. We don't even have any numbers, only percentages. For all we know it is a gang of 20 asians doing 75% of the rapings. Does that mean all asians are at fault? We should come down hard on the people at fault instead of blaming the community as a whole.

Again we're assuming here that the default world view of an un-prosperous individual is to be criminal. It's only through education and prosperity that they learn not to be criminal? 

And again although crime will be higher amongst poor white areas than rich ones - why should sex crime with a high white-person target rate be the chosen-go to of these people and why are they primarily Asian, when there are plenty of white people in equally difficult circumstances in this country? 

Anything you've suggested can be applied to any culture - but it's Asians who seem the majority here. 

Could it be something specific to Asians, then - and not a simple lack of education or being impoverished - which is not an Asian specific issue?

I'm not sure how this addresses what i've said. 

&gt;Simply passing off the current situation as an ""unfortunate consequence of globalisation"" 

If labour costs go up, cost of production goes up and it makes more sense to move production to somewhere where labour costs are lower.

It's simple economics. Ghastly as it is, pretending we can just ashew it is stupid. 

&gt;not only institutionalises poverty wages and state subsidy, but also high consumer debt and a horrendously unbalanced world economy (i.e. the leading causes of the last crash).

The DUP are clearly concerned about this, sending two sitting MPS into a committee meeting. They know they have done wrong by the elected councillor and they are in damage control now. They either need to make an example of SPAD and publicly disassociate themselves from him or just get session after session suspended and drag it on until it is swept under the carpet in the next Assembly sittings.

Someone needs to help Sammy and Gregory pick their toys up as they have been well and truly thrown out of the pram.

Also, be prepared for a lot of fear mongering in the next year or two leading up to the Assembly elections in 2016.

false,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; Just because apparently asians are committing 75% of groomings in the west midlands does not mean that the fault is multiculturalism and immigration for allowing asians in the country.

It's a hard truth but if we weren't so invested as a country in forcing multiculturalism and immigration, there would be fewer Asian people and ergo the statistics would change. I say that without prejudice - that's just simple maths. 

&gt; The actual way to solve this is to investigate the crimes and the reasons why it is happening, maybe it is cultural in these men. I don't know. We don't even have any numbers, only percentages. For all we know it is a gang of 20 asians doing 75% of the rapings. Does that mean all asians are at fault? We should come down hard on the people at fault instead of blaming the community as a whole.

Well this really does depend on the reasons. You're right that we don't have the exact figures but assuming they're enough to be a problem (and you don't need thousands of child sex groomers on the streets, let's face it) - 75% is a strikingly large percentage. What is it about these specific men then? Is it all an accident that the majority are Asian or is it a cultural thing? 

&gt; the ONLY reason cases like this happen and Rotherham happen because of multiculturalism forcing police to ignore crimes by ethnic minorities because they are afraid of being called racists. Which is absolutely fucking insane.

And yet we do see evidence that the government, emergency services, public services and businesses are scared of being accused of racism - it's a black mark that *can* mean 'instant death' if society swings against a particular person etc. 

Do I agree that the police are definitely ignoring the problem? No. But I don't know for sure and I am also not prepared to discount that it may be a problem seriously rooted in some cultures that needs to be driven out of the country rather than allowed to grow under a shroud of fear of being branded a racist for looking in to it.

But in general these statistics will not capture the levels of abuse happening to girls within these Asian/Muslim/Pakistani communities, because they often have different attitudes towards the police, and cultures which shame the victim. Obviously that is a bad thing, and a problem in its own right, but this 'Asian men targeting young white girls' meme, which /pol/ are so keen on*, is very difficult to substantiate. 

I think it's an interesting companion to the attitudes that we have about paedophilia and child abuse in general - the public discussion centres on dramatic 'stranger danger' cases, like Madeleine McCann and the Soham Murders, when these cases are comparitively rare, and it's much more common for abuse to occur through people well known the child and in positions of trust - whether that be officials in charge of care homes, members of a family, or friends of a family. These stories, however, get less coverage because they make less interesting stories, and get less public attention, and less political action taken against them.

Having said that, this particular issue with street grooming does seem to be a problem, and action should be taken to prevent it. One of the principal ways we can make sure the law is applied to all cases is to remove the negative attitudes towards girls in the public authorities that are supposed to be protecting them (care homes, social services, police, etc) - 14/15 year olds being found in these situations were being dismissed as 'easy', and action not taken to deal with the situation. You need special units which can be brought in to pursue these cases, which will be guaranteed to treat the victims seriously and prosecute all offenders without prejudice.

The issue was that while I *had* a connection, I couldn't actually load any websites and I had 20k ms latency in online games before being thrown off. Switched to a new ISP and had no issues after that. Same BT lines, different ISP, which meant Virgin was clearly the guilty party.

Everyone else I knew who dealt with Virgin's ADSL broadband at the time had similar woes. Their cable broadband service wasn't much better, but that could've been NTL's fault too.

false,Morsrael,eng-Cheshire,Cheshire,"&gt;What is it about these specific men then? Is it all an accident that the majority are Asian or is it a cultural thing? 

It is difficult to say, we don't even know how many were abused. Another report said 111, but I'm not sure that relates to the 75% statistic. But like I said, for all we know its a gang of 20 men doing it all. Maybe it is cultural, but 20 rapists out of the total several hundred thousand non-rapist asians makes me think it isn't. But right now our energy should be focused on who did it and how and why it happened instead of wider blaming. Because I am willing to bet that in 99% of asian culture, or southern asian or even Pakistani culture in Britain child abuse is not acceptable. Bulldog and the rest of his rabid fools will politicise this and attempt to blame labour because they introduced multiculturalism and ignore the actual issues completely and that disgusts me.

&gt;scared of being accused of racism - it's a black mark that can mean 'instant death' if society swings against a particular person etc. 

You are right that is a problem. Especially when vile rags like the daily mail get hold of this and actually bring the issue into the wider society no matter if they were right or wrong. But that is a problem of pitchforking from the media and the people and not specifically about being painted as racism. For example the Daily Mail actually caused a transgender woman to commit suicide by hounding her because she was a teacher and they didn't like that.

&gt; But I don't know for sure and I am also not prepared to discount that it may be a problem seriously rooted in some cultures that needs to be driven out of the country rather than allowed to grow under a shroud of fear of being branded a racist for looking in to it. 

A fair viewpoint to have, however there is a huge danger of people jumping straight to its a problem of the people as a whole instead of the individuals at fault and in most cases it really is the individuals that are the problem. You don't think the West Borough Baptist church represents Christians as a whole and Christian culture any more than you don't think the scum on benefits street represent everyone on benefits or thieving gypsies represent all Romanians.

I don't believe the problem is because people are afraid of being called racists. If there is going to be a problem its because the police are stretched thin. I've not really heard of any large amount of cases of police reports being dismissed or asians who are without a doubt guilty getting off because they are being targeted via racism.",0,1413647513,null,0,false,0,clcy8mj,t3_2jllka,t1_clcy8mj,t1_clcxnq8,null,1426467781,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

Actually, while the Nazi strategy making the Jews into scapegoats clearly worked, wiping out those scapegoats wasn't just sociopathic - it was even stupid in a Machiavellian sense. Wiping out the scapegoats means you eventually run out of scapegoats. You can find new scapegoats, but you've already established the wipe-them out pattern.

We could paint a very different picture by looking at some national statistics from [this 2012 Ministry of Justice report on crime in general](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/269399/Race-and-cjs-2012.pdf), [this report on hate crimes](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/266358/hate-crime-2013.pdf), and [this one on sex crimes](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/214970/sexual-offending-overview-jan-2013.pdf):

* Black and Asian people are the targets of 24.5% of stop-and-searches and 14.2% of arrests, but only make up 12% of convictions (Asian people actually make up a smaller share of convictions than their share of the population)

* Black, Asian, and mixed-race people are all consistently more likely to be victims of crime than white people, with mixed-race people about twice as likely to be victims as white people

* Black and minority ethnic people are three times as likely to be victims of hate crimes than white people, and Muslims more than twice as likely as atheists

* Relative to their share of the population, white people are more likely to rape or sexually assault men or children than black and minority ethnic people are

So it turns out that white people are violent racist perverts who are more likely to be convicted of raping children even though the police disproportionately spend their time investigating black and Asian people.  Maybe white people should adopt the culture of immigrant communities?  Or maybe we should just accept that crime is complicated and that it isn't helpful to paint broad-brush pictures of entire ethnicities.

Also, I'm holding my breath for someone to point out that almost all sex offenders are men and call for men to adopt female culture.

Sure. You and I accept that. And it's easy for me to say. Hell, from my point of view it just means I can get someone to clean my house cheaper. But if you were a cleaner or some other low skill, low paid job, you'd find it hard to believe that immigration is good for you personally when you now have hundreds of thousands of people willing to work for cheaper than you.

That's partly who Farage is appealing to. I'm not saying I support UKIP (I don't), but I'm saying that you can't make an economic argument only for immigration. The same reddit audience here is happy to say that economy/profit isn't everything when it comes to things they DO like such as the NHS, schools, tuition fees etc. If we could have net economic benefit for the country by only treating taxpayers on the NHS, would people support it? Or maybe only sending the top 20% to University? But when it comes to immigration, people are more than happy to quote statistics showing economic benefits without considering how it FEELS for millions of people in the country. That is exactly why UKIP are gaining so much traction now - because those people have been written off as simply racist, xenophobic or crazy.

Even for culture, nobody really has a problem with Indian restaurants or Polish butchers. And immigrants certainly benefit the whole country culturally.

In reality a lot of people know it's fake but don't care because it helps them push their agenda, it's just appealing to easy prejudice and easy scapegoats and preying on the ignorant and gullible, it's nothing new like you said but it's always been effective propaganda because it appeals to prejudice in a way that distracts the recipient from being skeptical and questioning it's bearing on reality because it's an ""other"" where people's perception is rooted entirely in prejudice and they believe everything they read because they don't actually know many immigrants and don't have the motivation or the capacity to research immigration on an academic and rational level 

The press has always preyed on people's prejudice to peddle propaganda for cash, in the 80s it was gay and black people, now it's general immigrants, peadophiles or Muslims.  The press preys on the cultural climate of the time and shifts with people's attitudes, it drains every drop it can and feeds it as much as it can to keep the gravy train running until people's attitudes and prejudice shift, and
then the papers will shift with them and pick up on whatever the new ""other"" is and ramp
up the hate train again for cash. 

It's always been the same model, the faces just change with the times to reflect the hate of the people. I've never used a 1984 reference on reddit because le cringe but if anything can be fairly described as a realistic representation of the 2 minute hate then this is it. It's like a feedback loop; they first deliberately target a weak spot in the arsehole and shove a tube up there, drain the shit out, and then stick the other end of the tube in their mouths and feed the shit back to them until they get so full of shit they pop and it rains gold coins and shit 

It's probably one of the most revolting things in the world to me but people just lap it up, for many it seems they genuinely love to be full of hate and fear, poor people with little intellectual or material worth will always need a scapegoat to feel better about
their lives, and press will always feed it. 

The people in press or in power who help push this tradition are right at the bottom of the barrel for me, I think they're parasites and vampires who get fat off other peoples blood. They prey on people's prejudice like liposuction and then feed the pus and fat back to them through a straw, vom

&gt;Data compiled by Tell Mama UK, which monitors anti-Islamic hatred, reflects fears that the actions of IS are provoking Islamophobia in the UK.


&gt;In August it received 219 reports of abusive incidents targeted at Muslims in England - the same month as the IS beheading of US journalist James Foley.

&gt;This was almost double the 112 incidents recorded in January, though the organisation stresses its figures only show a glimpse of the full picture, with many victims of racial hate crime afraid to report abuse.

&gt;The findings of an inquiry into child sex abuse in Rotherham between 1997 and 2013 are also a cause of increased hate crime towards Muslims, Tell Mama UK suggests.


&gt;The report, commissioned by Rotherham Borough Council, found at least 1,400 children were sexually exploited by criminal gangs predominantly of Pakistani heritage.

&gt;In August, when it was made public, over a quarter of anti-Muslim hate crimes (58) recorded by Tell Mama UK were said to be provoked by the scandal.

Anyhow, the only tweak I'd like seen made is to tighten the balance between forward and defensive play. We'll terrify every team in the league off the counter, but we do leave ourselves exposed often. If we were playing a decent more clinical premier league side today, they could easily have put 4 or 5 past us. So, just reign it in ever so slightly, find a balance, stay healthy, and we may find ourselves at the head of the Peleton rounding the bend in '15.

The &lt;4 rule is not too fixed really, I think it is basically just a guideline so that we don't turn up at customer sites in clapped out old bangers. 

12K for the car + 3 years of running costs doesn't seem too bad to me; I am not going to be doing a ton of miles, maybe 8000 a year. I am also going to be paying Â£800 per annum less tax as a result of no longer having a P11D to worry about. 

I could go with nearly new, I've got the money in the bank, but at the moment I have that money mentally allocated to my mortgage deposit. The other option I guess I have is using a couple of grand as a deposit on a nearly new and taking a finance deal. The deals I have seen so far however don't make nearly new that much cheaper than new in most dealers. Benifits of buying new include some pretty significant discounts/dealership deposit contributions etc.

From watching the way we consistently play football I have to possible conclusions 1. Lambert didn't not trust in his players ability to go out play a proper game of football and score goals, only in their ability to stand on the goal line and stop shots then run down the other end. Or lambert has absolutely no tactical knowledge of the game at all, it's so rare to see him change a formation of tactic mid game when we are obviously loosing 30% possession at half time everything's fine boys go out and play them same again. 
Or maybe it's a mix of both ? 
But either way both of these would be having an impact on the players and there confidence if their constantly playing this way surely they would be thinking to themselves ""why can't we go and play take a game to them and play an open game, it must be that were not good enough to play like this""

The government can increase spending to stimulate the economy when necessary and then reduce spending at a later date to control inflation. 

What many people fail to understand is that some increases in government spending are supposed to be temporary. When they increase spending some people complain about the deficit, then when they decrease it again other people complain about spending cuts. Either way the government looks bad for doing something that benefits society. 

The end result is that the government is unable to fully utilise fiscal policy and when it does it has to spend the money on wasteful projects with a finite lifespan rather than the projects that provide the most benefit to society. It also makes fiscal policy a less viable alternative compared to monetary policy, so the government has to resort more to monetary policy that makes the rich richer.

Until then, continue living in your fantasy world where this actually happens to normal people on a regular enough basis for it to be a problem.

The legislation is how it is in order to allow confiscation and prosecution of people already committing crimes of a similar nature, so they don't have the equipment to do it anymore. It's pretty simple to understand why it is worded the way it is. It's not so that anyone can be arrested for owning a cable, that's just a silly imaginary case you just made up. I for one have plenty of JTAG adapters and other various items that are illegal to own with intent but I am not worried at all. Why?

You really need to look at Islam as a faith and religion to understand  why raping kids is ok to them.

Oh, raping white girls is also ok under sharia law also. so you might want to think about that when they bring in into UK law. (which they are trying to do.)

I've, personally, never been able to accept that Jews are ""special"" because they were targetted for death in World War 2. So what?

A lot of other people died in World War 2. Not just killed - raped, maimed, worked to death.

The problem with idolising Jewish deaths in World War 2 is that it minimises the horrors of World War 2. It diminishes the deaths that occurred to everyone else. It ignores the mass destruction of family ties and many people never saw their country again,

For the same reason idolising black slavery generations ago is minimising what happened to people in World War 2 - a far more recent event.

false,bruisedbollocks,newbadge,,"My weekly reports of gushing praise or damning criticism are becoming something of a routine now, and I feel it's a good way to outlet my feelings, so I'll get to work.

Firstly, this was an abysmal game, and both teams will really be struggling to stay up if they play like that consistently; the marking was poor and loose, the closing down was slow and half-hearted, but the passing and control of the ball was so shoddy that the chance creation remained low, and that goes for both sides. Even Cambiasso, an adept passer of the ball, had very poor accuracy in the first half particularly, and our ball retention for the first 20 minutes was terrible.

We slowly grew into the match though, and towards the end of the first 45 we looked more composed on the ball and looked like we had the ability to control the match. Our defensive weaknesses are clearly down the flanks, and crosses into the box have been a source of difficulty for Schmeichel. However, Newcastle's delivery of the final ball was very poor and they ended up reverting to long balls, which Morgan and Moore are very capable of defending. James and Coloccini both had fantastic chances in the first half, Albrighton's overhit cross almost went in, and both sides could have gone into the break 1-0 up. 0-0 was fair at the break though.

In the second half we actually came forward more and it was after two attacking substitutions and our first sustained period of pressure in the Newcastle half that (IIRC..) De laet hit a shot from the left-wing position (?), it was blocked, and then we were caught backtracking on the counter-attack. While I can fully encourage an attacking philosophy against teams who we feel are on a similar level to us, being caught on the counter at 0-0 away from home is something we should be more cautious against, and Cambiasso doesn't have the legs to defend against such quick attacks. On the other hand, I don't think we have been caught on the counter at all so far this season, although this is probably more a reflection of the way we have approached games. It was a good finish, however it is a goal we should be disappointed to concede and the absence of any pressure on the ball between losing it high up the pitch and our 18-yard box is unacceptable.

Our control of the ball in midfield was a massive let-down, and I think Cambiasso, Drinkwater and James should be able to perform to a better standard. Going forward, their creativity was also lacking, and it is perhaps telling that we have looked a more structured side defensively when King and Hammond have been on the pitch. Ulloa's hold-up play could have been better, although I think he was a little isolated when we had 5 in midfield.

Defensively I think we are starting to look sloppy. A number of times we gave the ball away carelessly in very dangerous situations (e.g. Konchesky to Cisse), and we made Obertan and Newcastle, a team who have really been struggling going forward, look quite threatening. Our defence hasn't come in for much criticism so far this season, and understandably so, because we have been getting results. However much of this praise has been for what I'll call ""last-ditch"" defending - Moore and Morgan have probably blocked more shots than any other defensive pairing so far (if anyone wants to find the stats to prove me wrong or right, please do so!). I feel Konchesky and De Laet are probably weak points too, as wingers running at them look to cause them a lot of problems, as Obertan did to great effect today.

In the context of the first 8 games, of course we would have taken 13th place and 9 points. However, given that we took 8 points from the first 5 games, which looked extremely tricky before the start of the season, we have really messed up in taking 1 point from the last 3 games. Crystal Palace, Burnley and Newcastle will most likely be in the bottom half of the table, along with us, come the end of the season, and I think Nigel will have been aiming for 4 points at the very least from these matches. To take 1 point from a very possible 9 is a real missed opportunity to put some daylight between us and the bottom end of the table.

The next 4 games could give us a real idea of how we will perform this season. Swansea away and Southampton away will be really tough games, and given the form of both of them we should be delighted if we were to come away with 2 points here. However, West Brom and Sunderland at home have now become must-win games for us, after the lack of points garnered from the previous 3 games. 6 points from the next 12 will put us in good position going towards the Christmas period. However, if we underperform over the next 4 games, we will end up involved in the relegation battle sooner than we intended.",0,1413656558,null,0,1413658435,0,cld21jb,t3_2jmd0i,t1_cld21jb,t3_2jmd0i,null,1426466007,7,false,lcfc,t5_2ukrz,7

 ""Hortapharm, whose chief grower is said to have created one of the most popular strains of marijuana, Skunk No. 1, has a licence from the Dutch government to grow marijuana for research purposes.""
Hortapharm also supply GW the seeds so im guessing that most of their cultivars are bred through skunk no. 1.

Cannabis contains Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), which doesn't have any psychoactive properties. In order for it to have psychoactive properties, it needs to be decarboxyated (which is type of chemical reaction which [removes a carboxyl group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decarboxylation) from a [carboxylic acid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboxylic_acid)). THCA is decarboxylated into Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (which is psychoactive) from either leaving cannabis to dry for a long time, or quickly by heating it. This is why you can't get high by eating raw cannabis, but you can get high by baking it into brownies or some other food.

Eating raw cannabis likely isn't that different to eating grass or some other leaf if you're a sheep, or a human.",0,1413658726,null,0,false,0,cld2yu0,t3_2jliau,t1_cld2yu0,t3_2jliau,null,1426465576,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Can I cap a contract phone?

Yes, you can usually cap your phone. Once you have your new phone, you simply need to ring Three's customer services team and ask them to put a spending cap on your contract. This includes a zero spending cap, meaning that once you have used up your allowances you will be unable to make any more calls or send anymore texts. 

**However, Three cannot guarantee that the spending cap will always work. For example, it may not work if you use your phone abroad or if important system maintenance is being carried out. There are also some numbers for which you will always be charged, regardless of whether you have used up your allowance. These include, and are not limited to, calls to Directory Enquiries, premium numbers, international numbers and free phone numbers that may not be free when called from a mobile.**",0,1413660040,null,0,false,0,cld3ivs,t3_2jk2jc,t1_cld3ivs,t1_clchbq8,null,1426465316,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Firstly, the idea that one's ethnicity can define behaviour does not make much sense. What would be more pertinent and interesting to examine is the cultural and subcultural environment of the individual, to see if there are any attitudes present that would make child sex offences more likely. However, ""Asian ethnicity"" implies such a broad range of cultures as to make this impossible (other than by racist stereotyping).

Secondly, just because a correlation has been described between ethnicity and a certain aberrant behaviour, does not mean that it is causative. Other factors will be involved - for example, broad categories such as socioeconomic status and age, but also more personal influences throughout life (such as, if the child sex groomers were abused as children themselves). It would be thoroughly irresponsible and inaccurate to imply from this article - as many commenters here seem to be doing - that Asians are child rapists.

Thirdly, we don't even know if this statistic is at all significant. At one extreme, we could be talking about just four child sex groomers, three of which have Asian ethnicity and one of which has non-Asian ethnicity. Without further information of how this data was gathered, and the actual numbers involved, then the statistic is meaningless.",0,1413661990,null,0,false,0,cld4dmb,t3_2jllka,t1_cld4dmb,t1_clctyd4,null,1426464905,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

&gt;A researcher in Britainâs Home Office, which is responsible for domestic security and border control, was reprimanded and sent to a âtwo day ethnicity and diversity courseâ for refering to the Pakistani rapists in Rotherham as âAsianâ.

&gt;The worker, who was speaking to the BBCâs Panorama programme, noted that senior officials in the department told them to ânever refer to that againâ when they raised the issue of Muslim men grooming young white girls in Rotherham.

Because it's indicative of a problem with that specific community, and you cannot fix problems without accepting they exist first.

First of all, these girls were underage, and second of all yes it is always rape if they've been heavily given alcohol and drugs to take advantage of them.

&gt;It's ""on the street offenders"" because they haven't been charged; they didn't actually do anything wrong.

To do that, there have to be laws, obviously (see '[Nulla poena sine lege](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nulla_poena_sine_lege)'), and since that requirement must exist, there can't laws that cover ever detail of a crime, or else there would either be an infinite number of laws, or a finite number that don't cover all possible variations of a category of crime. So we have laws that cover entire categories ""Theft"" for example can be a lipstick stolen for a supermarket, or a Lorry from a transportation company. The damage caused is obviously wildly different, and yet both things are theft and are made punishable by the same law, and therefore similar punishments.

The second relevant aspect here is that criminal law isn't there to somehow vindicate the victim. It is there to punish and better the perpetrator, and, indeally, get them to see their wrongdoing and become a law abiding citizen again.

The thing that IS there to vindicate, or rather ""reimburse"" (if this term can in any way be used in such cases where someone's life has essentially been irrevocably ruined) the victims is the civil lawsuit.

At least since his Villareal days when they domintate United and Inter playing like that.

To his malaga days when he was in the brink to CL seminfinals. 

And these two seasons I think with city, he plays faster (he has way more quality) but still tries and command to dominate possession, they never seat back contempt with not having the ball. In fact, like sfida95 pointed out City almost always dominates possession, and it's not just a matter of quality, it's a matter of philosophy.

I left out his Real Madrid side because I don't know too much about it.

Edit, I'd like to add that while city plays with 2 strikers, they tend to drift wide or fall deep to play the ball.

I've heard people says that Pelle's plays possession based football but only because he doesn't know how to defend properly (time to fire a few shots: almost always from Mourinho fans), so he mitigates this by trying to keep posession.  

I don't agree with the above statement, but I've heard it. I can argue on the contrary, saying that defense is where more changes on pelle's philosophy you can notice. At villareal he played with a very deep, static and solid defensive line 2 strong center backs shielded by the two in front(with the usual fullbacks overlaps to create triangles of passing -almost his trademark-) At city, on the contrary he plays sometimes with a very high and risky defensive line (a lot of goals where scored at the beginning of the last season because of that, the team were adjusting at that), much more fluid (I think the outstanding quality of Kompany has to do with that).

But, hey, opinions are opinions, the fact that someones has more knowledge of facts and such, don't necessarily proves his point or means that he is correct.

It has a Â£4000 street value (no weight or number of plants is mentioned in the article). At the price (Â£40 for a quarter, Â£160 for an ounce) I could get it for assuming I smoked it (of course I don't, that would be illegal ;)), that works out to be about 25 ounces when dried.

A quick bit of research seems to suggest that one cannabis plant can yield anywhere between 1.5-10 ounces depending on growing conditions (don't quote me on this, I don't know anything about growing cannabis, just a bit of chemistry about cannabis). That suggests there was likely between 2 and 17 plants, which I doubt is enough to heat up to 70Â°C. I also doubt 70Â°C is hot enough for a lot of decarboxylation to occur, so even if it was that temperature, the amount of active THC would likely be very low.

Also keep in mind that the police like to use high numbers when calculating the street value to give the final number a bigger impact, so it's of course possible that there was even less cannabis there than I estimated. The highest price I've come across is around Â£15 for a gram, which is Â£420 (weird coincidence, or probably why it was Â£15 per gram) per ounce. In this case, it would work out to be about 9.5 Oz (dry), and so that works out to be 1-7 plants instead.

ANYWAY;

So, to sum up your points against The Doctor (an alien who can presumably take any form) becoming a woman.:

* People might be upset.
* ""It's silly.""

My argument:

* Better representation for the other **50%** of the audience.
* A chance for interesting new experiences and stories.
* Why not? Seriously, though - why not?

Why are you so desperately clinging to the concept of a male Doctor? Even if you don't see the point of changing his gender, can you not understand that there may be an issue that he's been cast specifically as a white man 11+ times, despite how the character functions (regeneration)? I know you said that you don't personally have an issue with him being a person of colour, but many people do. How is that not an issue? Why aren't we addressing those issues?

Some people stopped watching the show because The Doctor became *old* after being young for three regenerations. Don't you think those people are silly? That's exactly what you sound like right now - resistant to change just because you don't like it. There is nothing stopping the character from changing gender, and there is no good argument against it besides 'it's always been this way'. So what if people are a bit upset - people were upset when Kirk kissed Uhura. People were upset when Watson was played Lucy Liu. Where are those people when Khan was cast as a white dude when he was specifically a person of colour?

* Be wary of being a game developer. It's a relatively cruel arm of the IT industry as a whole with long hours and (sometimes) unreasonable expectations in order to meet deadlines. Feel free to Google this for more information - but regular software development might be safer, especially for a graduate. 

* London, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds and Brighton are all great cities for software development. 

* Weather across the UK tends to be universal - but coastal areas bear the brunt of any storms rolling in off the surrounding seas. In the summer you can sometimes look forward to Mediterranean conditions - in the winter it can reach a sub-zero. 

* If you move to London you will probably not be able to drive. Living in London is *very* expensive and owning / insuring a car will only compound that. Unless you have some money put away, I wouldn't expect to regularly drive around London. 

* Yes, some cities are more friendly towards foreigners than others - but I doubt a Portuguese person will run into too many problems in any of them. I know of no prejudices but may be wrong (anyone with any other experience?). 

* A graduate software developer outside London can expect anywhere from Â£18,000 to Â£23,000 (roughly) annually. In London this should rise to Â£25,000 to compensate for the cost of living in London - which is more expensive than elsewhere in the country. 

(The exception to the above question of wages is in working for larger companies like British Telecom who will offer much higher graduate salaries - but are more choosy about who they take on.

&gt;Is there any city more oriented towards software development?

Not compared to Portugal.  Maybe if you're from the North (of Portugal) it won't be *as* bad, but still pretty bad.  And you feel worse when the weather is bad because the architecture here is all browns and greys.


&gt;If I move to London would I be able to have a car with ease? I quite like driving so having to give that up will devastating.

Depends where you live in London and what you use it for.  It can be expensive.  There is a [car club](http://www.citycarclub.co.uk/) if you just want to drive occasionally for fun.

&gt;Are some cities more friendly towards foreigners than others?

Some working class cities might be a little less friendly, but not a big difference.  There are plenty of other Portuguese people in London if that's what you're looking for.  I've never randomly met one that wasn't a tourist anywhere else, only through other Portuguese people, but I guess they kind of blend in.

Here are the [plain facts](http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Man-23-left-paralysed-brain-damaged-single-punch/story-18209245-detail/story.html) of the case, which I think wouldn't give people quite as strong an emotional response.

&gt; I do agree that this is written in a highly emotive fashion, but I think with good reason. It's not a bad thing to get the public involved with the process of the judiciary, and riling people up is probably an effective method.

I completely disagree, I think it's disastrous to base a judicial system on purely emotions and gut feelings rather than making evidence based decisions; you'll end up making the wrong decisions. If you base your world views on pieces like this then you'd think that the country is getting more and more violent when in reality most crimes are falling. You'd probably end up with a completely punitive justice system rather than a system based on rehabilitation, a revolving door prison system where people are locked up for a long time on flimsy evidence and just released with no chance of being able to function in society without going back to crime.

In this case maybe the sentence was too lenient, but the whole point of innocent until proven guilty is that it is hard to lock people up, not easy. Smith was charged with GHB without intent which only carries a maximum of 5 years, with an automatic 1/3rd off due to the guilty plea. Apparently there was no proof of premeditation so he couldn't be charged with GHB with intent.

There could also be other mitigating circumstances too, which we can't know without seeing all the court proceedings. It's certainly not possible to get an informed view of the case from this article as not only are the facts clouded by emotional writing, but the way it's written makes me feel that any facts which didn't fit the emotional narrative of the author would have been left out.",0,1413670545,null,0,false,0,cld81gq,t3_2jla2q,t1_cld81gq,t1_clcwqhm,null,1426463197,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

&gt;However, the explanation offered so far has been incomplete. Many are left wondering why condemning ISIS raises concerns about unfairly condemning all Muslims, whereas condemning Israel does not raise concerns about unfairly condemning all Israelis or Jews. Does labeling UKIP as a âracist, xenophobic, homophobic and sexist organizationâ not potentially condemn members of UKIP that do not hold such views?

&gt;Pretending that the issue is simply that NUS failed to condemn ISIS misses the point. The question that many are wondering, as explained in various articles, is what makes this motion on ISIS different from the sweeping condemnation of Israel and UKIP?

&gt;Until such explanation is provided, the media coverage of the issue is hardly âvery unfairâ.

The reason the NUS will Condemn Israel and UKIP is because it's the trendy left wing thing to do, while condemning anything remotely related to Islam is too ""islamophobic"".

&gt;___Carnival of Monsters___ is the second [serial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) of the [tenth season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(season_10\)) of the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*, which was first broadcast in four weekly parts from 27 January to 17 February 1973. It is the first serial since *[The War Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_Games)* in which the Doctor is allowed to pilot the [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS) completely under his own control.

&gt;It was also the title of a 1999 [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC) documentary looking at some of the adversaries that the Doctor had faced in the programme.

&gt;In September 2012, [Matt Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Smith_(actor\)) stated a desire to see an episode of *Doctor Who* directed by [Sir Peter Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson), the director of the *[Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series\))* trilogy. Jackson responded positively to the suggestion by saying ""name the time and place"".  In March 2013 he maintained his desire to have an involvement in the show, stating that he would happily accept a [Dalek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalek) in payment.  Steven Moffat stated in August 2013 that Jackson was serious about his desire to direct *Doctor Who*, and also said that, if it were to happen, there was a good likelihood of filming taking place in [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand).
