Johnson was our most threatening player throughout the entire first half, AND he made a handful of solid defensive plays.  He was even winning his aerial battles.  But you simply can't play with that type of line-to-line intensity for 90 minutes, and you could tell he was gassed in the second half.  His inability to track back was not down to his quality as a player, it was down to BR's gameplan wearing him down, and then not bringing on substitutes to cover any of that workload.  I'm gutted for Glen because he was frankly hung out to dry today.

Quick edit: before you say it, yes I know he dribbles himself off the ball sometimes.  I'm not arguing that he is a world-class fullback.

I've said this on here before, but I don't think the players are the problem Or rather, it's not that we lack talented players. Agger, Skrtel, and Johnson have all been part of much more airtight Liverpool defenses in the past. And Sakho is a French international. Who are we going to bring in that's better than them?

What we need is a coach who can do for the defense what Rodgers has done for the offense—instill confidence and belief in the system so that we can *cut out the stupid mistakes*. 

I think with the attacking players we have this is always going to be an attacking heavy side, which means we're going to concede some goals on the counter. That's something we probably just have to live with.

But if we cut out the stupid mistakes, it will go a long way towards making this a title-winning team. [This site claims](http://www.theliverpoolword.com/2014/03/analysis-of-liverpools-defensive-errors-in-conceding-goals/) that of the 35 goals we'd conceded at the beginning of March, a shocking 26 of them were down to individual errors. Now, obviously, a new coach isn't going to make any player perfect, but if we could cut out some of the more egregious errors (like passing the ball directly to the other team, Mr. Toure...), we'd have an incredible record.

Similarly, if we could shut games down the way Chelsea can—or even anything approaching that—we'd have more wins. Say what you will about BR's tactics today, but I think he knows this is a side that is confident going forward, and *not* confident when on the back foot trying to defend. I might still have played things more defensively than he did at 3-0, but I'm not sure we really have the defensive confidence to just park the bus and invite any team to try and break through our defense right now. 

So I think what we need is a new defensive coach who can help instill some of that confidence. We could use some depth and maybe some new talent in the wingback department, but I think those people suggesting replacing any of our CBs is going to fix anything are deluded. We bought a globally-respected international CB at the beginning of THIS season, and we're still making stupid errors. New players probably isn't going to fix the problem.",0,1399337266,null,0,false,0,chajt32,t3_24tamo,t1_chajt32,t3_24tamo,null,1433667970,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

true,dwils7,null,null,"Honestly think Rodgers panics at times and relies too much on the attack(obvious statement), when they scored we were obviously on the back foot and needed to just slow everything down and get control of the match but we kept pushing up and leaving space in midfield, really wish sakho would just show a reason as to why we paid the money for him and why keeps his place over agger, he has very little skill on the ball ALWAYS looks like he is gonna loose it or misplace a pass or just dives in with STUPID tackles no where near the ball. Lucas can't be a conventional midfielder, doesn't have the skill to do it, doesn't have the pace or the movement(missing hendo badly).

Personally think Allen did well no where near the level of hendo but think he put it a good shift. Struggling to see why suarez wasn't taken of when we were still 3-0 up I realize we needed goals but he was knackered, visibly looked like he was stuggling but we took sterling and sturridge off instead.

Seen a few posts about flanno aswell and have to agree that he isn't at a high enough level to play for liverpool week in week out but he is really all we have available just now with enrique being out, also think johnson played well, as always he could be better defensivley but thats just glen johnson for you he is far better in the oppositions half than his own. Defensively as a whole something has to be done, whether it is a new defensive coach or just better defenders lol, need at least a CB, LB and possibly an RB, all depends on which players leave think agger will go, since he cant get in the team and pretty sure johnson still hasn't signed a new contract.

Just my opinion guy and sorry for the long post it's good to vent a little lol!

true,jaywho,eng-nottinghamshire,Nottinghamshire,"/u/saviourman is right in that this thread is full of people who worked hard and didn't party. Uni's what you make of it, and you can do what you want. If you want to do drugs and fuck every night, you can do that and no one will stop you, provided you keep making 40%. Shit, there aren't even any real repercussions if you don't attend lectures and seminars. A guy I know was on frequent 'academic probation' for lack of attendance because he spent three years drinking and taking drugs and still graduated with a 2:1. But if you want to work your arse off for three years and get to know the inside of the library on an intimate basis, that's fine too. Hell, it's your life.

Either way, don't be worried. My university is also top 20, I did English  (""an easy english lit course because I don't have to study for it"" hurr durr) and loved it so much that I'm now doing an MA and have an offer for a PhD place. So it may surprise you that in my first year:

* Fresher's week ran from Sunday to Sunday. I went out every night, and to this day remember very little of those nights.
* I drank to the point of passing out every weekend, and, on occasion, midweek as well.
* I missed an exam, thus failing an entire module, because I got the time wrong
* Attended roughly 60% of my lectures/seminars across the year
* Read a grand total of three books (plus a few poems here and there)
* Took 0 books out of the library (this figure would rise to a whopping 17 by the end of my final year)

I finished the first year with an average of 57, and I didn't even have to do anything about the module I failed. The whole year basically counted for absolutely nothing, academically. I made a hell of a lot of friends, got a girlfriend in the same halls as me (living away from home is great ;)) who I'm still with coming up for 4 years later, and, in all honesty, had the best year of my life. The reason that I managed to still end up with a 2:1 was because I recognised that first year is just that. A Year. Out of three (or four, if you're on an MSci). A year which pretty much everywhere is pass/fail, and even if you're reliant on it for a placement, you only need a 2:1, which is incredibly easy to get with a bare minimum of effort.  I nearly managed to get a first at the end of my degree - laziness got the better of me because I needed a couple of 76s for the average to go up, but was guaranteed a high 2:1, and anything over 72 is pretty rare for English. Your first year won't affect your average, and it won't affect how your lecturers see you, but it will massively affect the quality of your life for the next three years.

For this reason, I always tell people to do what they enjoy. I could have done Maths or Physics - I have A-Levels in Maths, Physics, Further maths and English lit. It would have been a hard slog, and I would have much higher paying job prospects (the idea that English has no job prospects is rubbish - it has a far greater breadth of prospects than most courses, but not as much depth in each) but I wouldn't have enjoyed uni as much, nor the jobs that they lead into. What's the point of spending three years working your arse off so that you can work your arse off even harder for the rest of your life?

I didn't really start *working* until the third year (the books taken out remains low because Jstor is awesome and doesn't require leaving the house). Everything up until then was compulsory, or only an illusory choice, so it wasn't that interesting. But third year is where you start to feel like, yeah, I have actually learned something here. You have a dissertation, where you write something you're actually interested in, and I loved every minute of it. And it's not just English which is like this. I play intra-mural rugby for the physics society, and it's the same for them. Hard, boring work for the first couple of years, then a third year which is harder, before a fourth year where you do a project you're interested in which has a real academic impact, using everything you've actually learned.

Don't worry about this thread. People forget that uni isn't really about getting a degree. You're paying for an education, in the broadest possible sense; learning how to live. What OP, and a lot of others in this thread seem to not realise, is that learning how to live involves learning how to deal with arseholes and function as an independent adult. Shit, even the people you end up living with out of choice you'll probably end up hating at some point, simply because living together puts you under stress. You'll get that at pretty much any uni, so before you set your heart on one, go there, get a feel for the campus, the city and the people and then make a decision. I recommend my uni to everyone, and fully mean it, because the city's great, the campus is amazing and there's something for everyone to do, regardless of your interests.

Don't be put off because someone's got misplaced expectations about what uni is. It's not a dispensary of effortless knowledge, you won't be spoon fed, and your lecturers are not your teachers: they don't give a shit if you pass or fail for the most part. Don't approach them as though they do (initially, at least) and you'll find life much easier. I started going to office hours in my third year, and you know what? It helps massively. But not because they tell you all the answers. It's because they'll listen to your ideas, and give you feedback. They get to know you, and that means that you start to matter. Unlike your teachers, you may even get to know them. I still go for coffee with my old personal tutor, despite the fact that we work on completely different things, simply because he's a great guy and I enjoy talking to him.

The £9k you're paying isn't for you to be taught, it's for you to study and be given a qualification. There's an expectation that it entitles you to more contact hours, but it's bollocks. How are you going to develop intellectually if all you are is the composite of a load of lecturers? Putting it frankly, OP's post is a crock of shit. I'll bold one of the reasons why:
&gt;Awful teaching is passed off with the excuse that, '**you should be doing independent learning**', yet **they provide** no resources except for textbooks with no illustrations or anything of even the slightest hint of engagement or excitement. These books are quite frankly, shit.

Independent means you do it yourself. You set most of your own homework. You do your own reading. You don't have to do what someone tells you. If you happen across something difficult, by all means, go and ask for advice. It's what office hours are for.

I hope you're not genuinely worried as a result of this thread, because honestly, you should be looking forward to uni more than anything. It's three+ years of new experiences, new friends and new ideas which you won't find anywhere else. It's a reasonably safe place in which you can break away from your family and find out who you really are (on that note, never go to uni closer than an hour away from home unless the course is awesome). I have a job in which I phone up alumni to talk about their experience at university. I speak to people who graduated anywhere from 60 years ago to last year, and you know what? 99% of those people loved their time at uni, are still friends with their friends from uni, and appreciate what a hugely positive life experience it is - even if a significant number of them never used their degree in their working life ever again.

I've spent far too long over this post because it's easier to write about the awesomeness that is the university experience than to write about morality in the post-war British novel, so it might not make a lot of sense. Hopefully the message is clear though. Go to uni. Study something you love. Don't be a stuck up twat. Accept that lecturers are people too (and frequently work 50+ hour weeks because of stuck up twats who demand more teaching in order that they can still function as academics). Enjoy your life.

true,davie18,cnty-england,Newcastle Uni,"I particularly feel fury towards the government because of this. My mum suffers quite severely from bipolar, and in recent months it has perhaps been the worst it's ever been. Just a couple of weeks or so ago, she was going through a particularly bad patch, and without a doubt *had* to be in a hospital. She was taken in am ambulance to A&amp;E, because there were no beds at all free in the whole of the county. 24 hours later, they discharged her from A&amp;E as there were still no beds.

Completely fucking unacceptable. She was a danger to herself with the state she was in and they just released her because there was not one free bed for her to go to. 

It's a joke how mental health is treated, even in 2014, an absolute joke. It's as if it's still even now not taken seriously when the number of people having to travel long distances just to get treatment has DOUBLED in the last year despite the number of people being admitted FALLING.

I'm glad it's finally getting some media coverage and I hope the issue can gain some momentum and change can be made, but I can't fucking believe the cuts were made in the first place when the healthcare for mentally ill people was already simply nowhere near good enough and drastic improvements were required to bring it up to the standard that we should be expecting in 2014 in a developed country... and they go and make huge cuts to it. 

I've always thought the NHS was unfairly criticised in the past because I've personally had good experiences with it.... up until when my mum's bipolar started getting very bad. It has certainly opened my eyes.

On top of this, they completely fuck over mental health patients when they do get care too. My mum has simply been unable to work the last couple of years because of how bad she has been suffering from the illness, and so she has been on benefits. However, as soon as she goes into hospital the benefits are stopped completely. I know that might seem reasonable, however she still has bills to pay such as rent, mobile etc even when she is in hospital.... how exactly do they expect her to do that? It's putting her under even more stress and making her health deteriorate even more and it's just a fucking joke.",0,1399338412,null,0,1399338637,0,chakbow,t3_24tp6o,t1_chakbow,t3_24tp6o,null,1433668212,14,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,14

A great many of the students, when let of the parental leash, turned the halls in to a massive cesspit; it exemplifies the ""It's not mine I don't care about it"" attitude some people seem to have IMHO. 

The course, which was the first time they'd offered it, was poorly run, requirements disastrously miscommunicated and neither lecturers or other staff gave two shits about WHY 99% of people stopped turning up to lectures. 

Personally I see University these days as a massive waste of money if it fails to instill in the students how to learn in very short order; not a trivial skill by any stretch of the imagination yet one a LOT of students going to University seem to lack.

So you sound like you've got a goal. Awesome. You can see what you want and it's just on the other side of all this drunken noise. Nice.

But here's an idea, and please approach it with an open mind.

Just as university has surprised you, with it's sad drinking culture, it's overpriced everything, a complete lack of commitment by 9/10ths of the students and 7/10ths of the staff...

Yup, just as much as university has let you down - the world will bring you up.

I'm not talking about getting a placement, or finding a good career, or making your way into a nice six-figure salary so that you can have nice things and not worry too much about the mortgage.

I'm talking about travel, people, the world.

I'm saying - we're all going to die one day. The sun will rise and set, you'll be a day older and will it really matter if your bed cost $500 pounds or $5000?

What I'm getting at is - don't be in a rush. You sound like you're already pretty bloody smart. I have no doubt by the end of this you'll be an A student.

But that's the point - you'll be able to find a job no matter what you do. So why not consider traveling. I mean REALLY traveling. 

Go see the world. Go to places where you can't speak the language, where you don't know how you'll make money, where you don't know anyone and maybe haven't ever known anyone who knows anyone who's been?

At the end of the day you can come back home, take that awesome job, and kill at it - making all the money you need.

But you'll be richer before the plane hits the ground. 

All the kids who spent all day in the library or the pub - they won't know what a sunrise over the Grand Canyon looks like. Or how your fingers go numb in 5 seconds when in a Moscow winter. They wont understand how it feels to get in a punch up with a Malaysian taxi driver who tried of steal your phone and how you literally ran till the sun came up and your friends found you. They won't know what it feels like to ride a motorcycle across the Southern Alps of New Zealand and throw snowballs in the blazing summer sun, then 30 minutes later - be sweating your balls off and swimming naked in a freshwater lake that no one has visited in months, maybe years...

Wow. Okay so that ran away on me.

true,midnight-cheeseater,null,null,"I own a second floor flat (in a block of 8 flats) on the seafront road (Kingsway) in western Hove. It is at the southern end of St. Leonards Gardens, which is a road running at 90^o to the seafront, about 200 -----&gt; 300 yards east of Station Road, Portslade.

I have two long term lodgers already, but I have one spare bedroom. It is already furnished with a double bed, complete with mattress, sheet, pillows, duvet with duvet cover. It also has a built in wardrobe, two small chests of drawers and several built in shelves. It has a window facing west, complete with both curtain and roller blinds. There is a 3-way ceiling light, a bedside light and a double socket, although I can provide an extension lead with distribution board if more sockets are required.

You would both have to sign and agree to my ""non-exclusive occupancy agreement"" - the official definition of ""lodgings"". This is more or less the same as a ""tenancy agreement"", the only difference being that I am a live in landlord - I occupy one of the three bedrooms in the flat, and share the common areas. The non-exclusive occupancy agreement gives you exclusive use of one bedroom in the flat, as allocated by me. It also gives you shared use of the kitchen, bathroom, toilet, lounge and hallway - shared with myself and my other two lodgers.

As is standard for any person(s) staying for more than 1 week, you would pay the rent as set out in the agreement, which would be £90 per week. June 1st -----&gt; July 7th is 5 weeks + 1 day, which I would round down to 5 weeks, making your total rent £450 for a 5-week stay. I usually require long term lodgers to pay a minimum of 4 weeks rent up front on the day of moving in. This is not negotiable. Your remaining 1 weeks rent will be due at the end of the first 4 weeks of your stay - if not paid, this will be deducted from your deposit.

You would also be required to pay a deposit of £200 (per bedroom occupied, not per person) up front, on the day you first arrive. This is also not negotiable. The deposit is held by me as security against potential loss or damage of any items provided in the bedroom you occupy or from any of the shared areas. It is also held as security against the sets of keys I lend you for your access to the building and flat - the deposit will not be refunded until both sets of keys are returned. You are prohibited by law (as well as the terms of the non-exclusive occupancy agreement) from having any copies made of any keys. You are also prohibited by law from giving any keys or copies thereof to any third party.

One additional item which you should be aware of (this is also stipulated in the non-exclusive occupancy agreement) is that my flat is strictly a non-smoking flat. There is a fire escape / balcony at the rear of the building, accessible through the rear kitchen door. If you wish to smoke, you may do so outside. If I detect the smell of smoke from your bedroom or in any common areas (of tobacco or any other substance), your deposit will not be returned. The same applies if either I or my current lodgers observe or find evidence of illegal drug use, or any other illegal or criminal activity, whether in your bedroom or in any of the common areas.

Sorry if this sounds harsh - but I have had bad experiences in the past with short term lodgers who I had not personally known prior to them moving in. My current two lodgers are long term personal friends of mine - they and I are tolerant but mature people. I am a qualified chemist by profession - I hold a degree and Ph.D in Chemistry from the University of Sussex. I frequently answer comments related to this subject on the Chemistry and Chemhelp sub-reddit sections - feel free to examine my comment history for evidence of this.

If you are interested, please send me a private message containing your full names, phone numbers (mobile or landline) and email addresses. The latter would be useful so that I can email you a copy of my non-exclusive occupancy agreement ahead of time. I will also email you back with my full name, the full address of the flat and building it is part of, my landline and mobile numbers, and of course my email address.",0,1399339314,null,0,false,0,chakqwn,t3_24egin,t1_chakqwn,t3_24egin,null,1433668411,1,false,brighton,t5_2qprp,1

The lectures seems utterly pointless, everything we currently know is through our own research etc. Which when we bring this up to the proff they says ""Yeah this is uni, it is very self learning centred""

No fuck off, I'm paying your god damn wages, I want you to teach me. It makes going to the lectures meaningless, but if I don't show up for something like 75% of them my Assignments get auto down graded or something. Like wtf, how does my attendance to something I'm paying for, as an adult have any baring on how you should mark my final work.  

At the end of the day, all we're paying for is the ability to get a certificate, not to earn it. If that makes sense. 

We pay to go to uni so we're eligible to receive the bit of paper, as all the knowledge we could get from Youtube and Wikipedia but then we don't have an expensive bit of paper to show an employer regardless of how much you know..... and then for them to just say they want someone with experience. 

University should provide something you can't get from Google, it should be special, and nothing result in everything you learn being stuff you could Google in your spare time and learn. What are we actually paying for. I'd much rather get the Assignments all at the start of the year and not be aloud to go to any lectures if it would cost me less.

 It's funny, this topic came up a little while ago, and I was one of the ones saying we don't need to do too much squad revision. But then I actually mapped out who we have and what formations we play and I was like 'well damn'. One of the main weaknesses with the diamond this year is that the players on the sides need to be able to threaten the goal when they overlap with the strikers and end up in the penalty box. Hendo and Allen had been getting into good position lately, but they aren't the ones to be converting those shots. We can get a winger who can also play that side role, or update the CAM and maybe push Sterling or Coutinho back and see if they can do well there. Think Suso could do a job in the diamond, but he'll need to ease into it.  I don't really like Lucas there on the side at all, and see his role being increasing limited.

true,syntax,null,null,"This gets tricky, fast.

Firstly, wood movement.  The environment that wood is stored in prior to purchase is extremely unlikely to be the same as the final environment for the finished item.  Therefore the wood will move, and thus the previously PSE boards will cease to be quite so square edged.

It is possible to mitigate the effects of this to a degree, but eliminating it is virtually impossible.  So you need to take that into account.  This is the primary reason that many woodworkers have tools for smoothing and squaring off wood (from the machine end: jointer and planer/thicknesser, or a few hand planes, a square, and a lot more time…).  Once you go down that road, there's little advantage in getting things planed either, so fought sawn boards is the order of the day.

Still, if we're looking at way to not need that, then your best bet is to fins a sawmill, that will machine the wood for you.  It will not get cheaper than a sawmill, and there's precious few other places that one can get hardwood boards from.

You might have to call a few to find one that'll cover what you are looking for - it depends what wood they have in stock (the more obscure, the fewer will carry it), machining capabilities, and workload (most sawmills will raise the minimum order at busy times).

I'm not familiar with your area, but a quick google finds a few sawmills in the right sort of ballpark; it's just a matter of calling them up in advance.

(I'm surprised at the large minimum orders on a timber merchants - none of the one's I've spoken to seem to do that.  Perhaps you're asking for something that they consider to be obscure?)

2) I wouldn't worry too much about size. Cars are generally smaller but the roads do have to accommodate buses and lorries (trucks) so you should be fine unless you're planning to drive through the middle of old cities (and you won't drive through the middle of anywhere--unlike American towns/cities, it's impractical to drive into city centres so you will want to park further out and walk in the rest of the way).

3) Again, I wouldn't worry about road quality unless you're really going off the beaten track. A lot of people like to complain about potholes but the major roads are always very well-maintained.

4) Having never driven a Mustang, I'm not really sure, but it goes where you steer it, right? I'd bet the traffic would be just as bad whatever car you're driving.

5) Possibly. I know I'd watch a Mustang if it drove past, and in an envious way! I wouldn't expect people to mind you acting American as long as you're sensitive to British sensibilities (i.e. try not to be too loud or over-friendly) and can take some light-hearted ribbing (it's inevitable, don't take it seriously). If you can't drive a manual that might be the source of some amusement (over here, if you can't drive a manual, you can't really drive) but the car itself should be fine.

6) *Petrol* will be expensive, yep.

7) Cars are relatively cheap; the real cost of driving is in the insurance, tax and fuel. For just a couple of years, I'd look at getting a used one for a few hundred quid (but I'm no expert).

Weather - It'll be 20-30C on the good days for about 3 months a year at best, the rest of the time it could anything between 0-20, going as low as -10-0 is not that unusual especially at night in winter. It could rain at anytime of year, sometimes torrential rain, even in Summer, there's no guarantees. Do your electrics like rain?

Size - Won't make a blind bit of difference, although in the inner city it helps to be small for parallel parking, hardly a big issue though. If you're living in London generally a car is just a pain in the arse. 

Roads - Average I guess, occasional potholes tend to appear after a cold winter and take a few months to get fixed. More so in the rural areas. The roads aren't really any more full of holes than the US, but potholes do exist. 

Steering - Won't make any difference 

MURICA - Your car will get a fair bit of attention, American car fetishists might approach you and ask you about it. American cars here are rare (why would be want them with Germany just across the sea?), except the regular uninteresting Fords of course which seem to be universal. 

Petrol (gas can't be a liquid) - £1.30 a litre, that's £4.91 for one of your wacky american gallons, that's $8.28 wacky dollars per wacky gallon. If you're getting 20 miles per wacky gallon you can imagine it's not going to be cheap at all. 

Buying a car - How long is a piece of string? You could buy a Volvo with 50k on the clock for a few thousand pounds and it's unlikely to break down (at least not anything serious) within 2 years. 

There are numbers of reasons not to do this though, other than the cost of petrol. Waiting for the shipping, insurance prices in the UK, having to convert the car to UK standards within a year, expense of parts should the car break down, lack of knowledgeable mechanics available if it needs some serious work, driving on the left, possibility of not meeting emissions standards for an MOT.

true,gereth,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"It has been over twenty years since I attended a British university, and while that was a different time compared to now I can relate to these concerns.

I ended up attending a pretty shitty university in northern England and choose to study the subject of Sociology. This was a mistake because their was so little teaching and learning that it was not even funny. Most of my fellow student would prefer to drink and get pissed and yes I had to deal with damage to the accommodation that I knew nothing about until I started to get bills for damage.    

After the second year I just decided not to go back and then went and worked for several years. In that time I moved to the United States and ended up going to university in the U.S. 

The one thing that surprised me was the amount of work required at U.S. universities, American higher education is a lot of work but it was an excellent preparation for me eventual career choice.  

In short, if you have the means and/or opportunity I could recommend studying in the United States. With the tuition so expensive now in Britain their might not be much difference in price (depending which institution you choose). I do think you would get a better education.

A) As my favorite comedian and idol, Bill Burr says, 'don't take shit from nobody.' Someone pointed out that with Liverpool winning and playing like they are, we're going to be getting a lot of bandwagoners. In that same respect, we're going to get a lot of haters. And i'm astonished as to how my facebook news feed has transformed into a Liverpool-hate-fest. Take that all in stride. I was a mess 5 hours ago as my Arsenal, City, Chelsea, United supporter friends all had a field day on what happened today. But then I looked at it, no one can be as proud of their team as we are entitled to. I didn't even have much to say to shut my Arsenal friend up with Szczesny admitting this season was a flop. Chelsea with the millions they've spent couldn't win a trophy, and City - well with a squad that deep and millions on reserve 1) i'll be surprised if they don't face any UEFA sanctions, 2) double surprised they aren't going for the treble. So don't take shit from no one, cause we are one of the biggest reasons why the league is where it's at this season. Notice La Liga, first time in years it's a 3 horse race, yet the premier league has attracted everyone's attention, starting with Liverpool.

2) Everyone seems to be forgetting how Palace started their comeback. A freak, wicked deflected, screamer. The second that went in, I looked at my friend and reacted as if it was 3-4. No one was to be blamed for that. I'm sick of all this criticism pointed towards Rodgers or the defenders or anything. I hate it. For 65 mins you're risking going 6-0 at the expensive of playing into the hands of a counter attacking team? This is why I stay away from forums after a defeat, everyone becomes Captain Hindsight with a part-time tactical analyst job.

Having said all that, I have never, in my life, cried while watching this sport. Today was the first day I did, twice. First, at the sight of Suarez inconsolably being led to the dressing room by the ever so gentle Kolo. Second, at how freaking, unbelievably, incredible, this season has been. Just last year, most of us here were so quick to blame our misfortunes on Henderson, Allen, Agger, Skrtel etc. I hate to make this analogy but it's applicable for me. Rodgers has pulled a SAF this season. Taking a team that on paper looks to be fighting for top 4, and tapped into their winning spirit - making them a stellar and united force. 

I hate to be that guy that says, we have champions league next season and we're ahead of schedule, but today I have been heartbroken beyond belief - and it's taken me to this place where I've discovered newfound love for this magnificent club.",0,1399347408,null,0,1399347601,0,chaofsv,t3_24t62v,t1_chaofsv,t3_24t62v,null,1433670217,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,[deleted],null,null,"The issue here is most people's definition of racism. We've come to a place where unless there's direct and often violent hatred expressed people decide there's no discrimination at all involved.

What we found with the inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence investigation and subsequent inquiries into policies such as stop and search is that actions that seem perfectly reasonable on paper can have in some cases unforeseen consequences for certain communities.

Look at a couple of UKIP policies that cause me concern:

* Prioritise social housing for people whose parents and grandparents were born locally.

My parents emigrated here in 1972. They were not born here, but I was. This policy would see that people like myself who have lived in some areas our entire lives are not allowed to live there due to where our parents and grand parents were born. Now you say, where's the racism? But such a policy would have a sum negative effect on pretty much every ethnic minority in the country that requires social housing. Thankfully I don't.

* No to Political Correctness - it stifles free speech.

What does this mean? What is at stake here? We're all familiar with the now hackneyed cry ""it's political correctness gone mad"" which invariably comes from the mouth of someone who was just taken to task for saying something egregious only to be surprised they didn't command broad support for their stupid views. Anecdotal as it is I've only ever heard such things when the targets were the disabled, women, homosexuals and ethnic minorities and the religious. Give me examples of ""political correctness"" being applied to protect someone not in the aforementioned group. As we've seen in the last few weeks UKIP members *love* targetting the above and hate being called out for it. Such a policy is there specifically as a dog whistle to those who miss the good old days when you could calla wog a wog.

* Teach children positive messages and pride in their country. We want to unite through better integration.

Again, perfectly reasonable on paper, but the phrasing is deliberately adversarial. Any other party would frame this as a program to improve language skills and promote English learning centres in the most ill integrated communities. Maybe incentives for taking such courses like funding, etc. UKIP come across like a band of brown shirts going door to door to weed out the unintergrated.

Retail companies know full fucking well how many hours they need to cover on any department, how many heads are needed, yet they want zero hour contracts? why? sick and holiday pay.

I was on a flexi contract with tesco at 7 hours per week, hell yeah I took it, but every month or so, they would put an overtime ban in place. So any additional hours I was working were taken away and I was on around £150 a month. At the time my living situation was like many in the UK, terrible. 

I could not do anything on those hours. After THREE years of arguing and working free days to show willing (billion pound company here) I finally had them backed into a corner when I worked the same shifts for three months, making, by law, those shifts mine.

I had to use law to get my employer to contract me to hours I should have been given from the start.

The pressure put on others who had the contracts was ridiculous. They needed the workers but would not pay.

This ruling is in favour of the powerful to control the powerless, and once more the union does fuck all to prevent it. The union is the biggest joke in the UK. Bunch of greedy, self righteous, uneducated wankers who are only working for the union to further their own careers in politics. or to protect themselves, because the only people protected by the union are the reps.

Also, if you have worked, you have paid tax, therefore JSA is getting back what you are OWED. Most on JSA have not however, but in my opinion, if you have paid in, the system should pay out.

What kind of company is in such a mess, it does not know how many people they need to run it? Evil, corporate cocksuckers. But the people of the UK will just roll over and say ""OK sir no problem"" because they are idiots who cannot seem to see the bigger picture.

I highly doubt the 'training' part of it is anything like real training for the players, it was just fan service really which is fine.

true,stickerface,uk,Bristol/Bedford,"Copying out notes and knowing the material is bad technique? Fuck me I better hand back my first class degree since my technique must be awful!

You're right, the best technique is to learn shitty little acronyms, whilst not really understanding the material thoroughly. I forgot that's what university is about! It's about learning just enough to pass, just like A-levels and GCSE's!

No a degree is NOT like that AT ALL. If you want to get top marks, you will be working hard and you will begin to see the whole world through the prism of your study. If you do not completely immerse yourself that's your decision, but it makes it that much more difficult if you don't care about what you're doing.

My technique was this - don't have a technique. Learn the material by constant repetition and completely immersing yourself in your study. There is no compromise. I can't think of anybody who has gotten a first class degree who didn't have to work hard.

This is advice for people who want to do their degree and then use it afterwards. You want to be a banker? Makes no difference if you got an 1st or a 2:1 in biology then, so don't bother working as hard.

I found my degree an exhausting but extremely fulfilling experience. Working that hard was a given during exams (note I say exams, not all the time) because exams are important. Sorry but you don't get to marathon Homeland or breaking bad during finals - you have most important exams of your life coming up. If you aren't working hard then, when the hell are you going to?

Just as a side rant - there is this bizarre perception on reddit that being smart is good enough, and that everyone is some sort of underachieving genius. If only somebody saw my potential!

That's the issue - zero hour contracts offer no long term security. One week it could be 0 hours, the next 37, then 10. Try applying for a mortgage with one, or living a normal, stable life when you have no idea how much money you're earning each month. Even if benefits increase a bit to cover those costs it won't be instant and people can very easily be left at the bottom of the pile if they don't have enough savings to cover the benefit shortfall. And before you say that's down to poor financial management - there are all kinds of reasons that they may have spent those savings while on JSA for this exact scenario/reason. 



Obviously zero hour contracts have a place in certain roles and can be used to employee and employer advantage, however this is clearly a case of it just benefiting companies but with the guise of 'the poor are lazy if they complain about work' - which has so far worked for the government without a hitch.

Liverpool may have been the club affected but I think every football goer of the period cares. No one should go the match and not get to go home. 

For the people of Liverpool to force the country to challenge the disgusting way the police lied, the Sun reporting, the 'it must have been the hooligans' brigade casual dismissal and keep it at the forefront is an absolute credit to them and won't stop anytime soon. The mawkish element may be a symptom of that, but doesn't outweigh the rest.

Interesting stats from the Belfast Telegraph version of the article:

&gt;Figures obtained by the Belfast Telegraph showed a worrying 43% spike in reported attacks on ethnic minorities across Northern Ireland in the past year. More than two race attacks are reported to police every day, with equality campaigners concerned up to 80% of incidents go unreported. Our figures showed that there were 156 race crimes across Northern Ireland in the first three months of this year compared to 103 for the same period in 2013. The majority of incidents took place in north Belfast (27), followed by the east (23) and south (16) of the city.


Majority in North Belfast. So the east Belfast bashers can shoosh.

true,nicotineapache,english,Smoggie in Mancland,"I worked for 6 years before going to uni, so yes, absolutely it was a step backward. I accepted that at the time. I had wanted to go back into education for a while (failed all but 1 A-Level in college, went to work in customer service) so I had a lot of time to think about it. I had decided to do the extra-curricular, to be the reliable one, to show up to every lecture and actively try to learn.

My foundation degree was in music production, so it was creative arts. Some of it seemed too easy - a lot of my peers were very lax and flakey. My halls were a joke - a bit like you're describing. Had beer stolen (never leave your beer in a communal fridge), had my hot sauce stolen, had to hide any chocolate etc. What I observed was over the 2 years of the foundation degree, the worst of the group would slowly drop off as they realised it wasn't for them. The way I handled it was pretty much over-kill. Still, I left with the equivalent to a 2.1.

The tutors, by and large, were fantastic. Really helpful, some were genius-level engineers and producers and a few I still talk to now. I went onto a top-up degree for 3rd year where it all changed. Previously, the building we were in was a college building, separate from the main building by quarter of a mile. We were generally treat with respect, as artists and people.

In 3rd year a few of us started a Broadcasting degree with a lot of 'film-makers' who had done HND's. All of a sudden the situation was as described here. Undergrads were seen as time-wasters for the tutors. The teaching was by-and-large awful. One tutor was the opposite of engaging. One was a bumbling fool (the course leader) who spent the first hour of each lecture telling us how to re-link media-files in Adobe Premiere before doing a lecture on camera techniques and directing (it was an editing class). Another, sound-design, was so basic (to us music producers/sound engineers) that any of us could have taught the class better. Web Design was the only one I found really engaging - and even that was just basic html.

I came out with a very precarious first-class degree, which was hard-worked for because I also did sound for a short film outside of the course. Although it felt like a bullshit degree, it sounds impressive to people. ""Wow, a first class honours degree in Professional Broadcast Techniques? How impressive!"" Even when I mention how bullshit it was, people will actually contradict me. It's great.

Now I'm on an audio production masters and excuse me because I have to show off the sythesizer I designed in Reaktor for an assessment. First though, the gym!

TL;DR: It's what you make of it, and the piece of paper at the end impresses people.

Oh, on a side note, go to the gym. You've got more time than you'll ever have and some free-money. Go to the gym if you don't already.

First it will be Ubiquitous, autonomous trucks and delivery vans as there will be huge opex and capex savings to be made for companies. 

At this very moment you have the likes of Google and the Motor Industry battling away to file patients.

We already have Caterpillar running automated model 793f mining trucks. Each with 2,650 horsepower and more than 25 million lines of software code. 

Amazon recently showed off their delivery drones. If any thinks this is just something cute off a university campus and has no commercial stake, then you will find different in time.

Google see what is happening and have a decent self driving prototype out navigating city streets https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk3oc1Hr62g

So, what does this all have to do with fear?

I expect over the next twenty years, anyone who works in transport or delivery will be redundant and not able to compete with automated vehicles. It will be impossible, humans make mistake, have sick days, holidays, make the wrong decisions over the best route to take. An automated vehicle will always know the optimal route to take and always use the least amount of fuel. 

We as a society are very unprepared for this. Automation is going to invalidate the need for masses of 9-5 workers. If we don't have a social welfare system in place, and a guarenteed wage, things will get shitty beyond all belief.

It could go two ways....

Utopia. None of us need to work anymore, or rather the whole definition of work will change. We will no longer need to be defined by our occupation and spend 8 hours a day doing something to make money.

Everybody thought Spurs would play for the title this season after they spent 100m. They even had a very decent manager in AVB. Yet now they fight for a place in the Europa League. 

Manchester United will never get back to old strength in one season, it will take a longer time. They need a good manager as well as a lot of good players which is impossible to get in one window. And if they were to land Louis van Gaal, I'll be very much pleased because he's a dickhead and dictator and while he reached the Champions League final with Bayern, he poisened the entire club and it took Bayern two season to get back to strength after he left. 

If we buy quality midfielders and defenders, there is absolutely no reason why we wouldn't even get more points next season than we got this season. 

The club currently has very competent people working for it, which cannot be said for Manchester United and certainly not for Spurs, and we have plan. This plan will see us dominate national and international competitions for years to come and we are even ahead of schedule.

People say this but the rise of his fortunes pretty much coincided with the paucity of decent match players in the game. His bad days are often dictated by the opposition avoiding playing into his hands. He thrives against the ultra aggressive players that have dominated the game recently. Against defensive players he tends to go missing.

I'll always rate Henry higher just because he played great attacking snooker in an era where there were great safety players in the game. Henry would beat any player no matter what style they brought to the table. Even with a broken arm.

We'll never know how O'Sullivan would do now but I think people elevating him above Henry or Davis on the strength of him blowing over some players with no real answer other than hoping the balls split nicely are mad.

Who the fuck saw that coming? The answer: no one. 

So to pretend that we're not going to be close because ""Oh well other teams will also be good"" ignores everything that happened this year. Will it be harder? Well, if we get actual signings in, maybe it will be equally as difficult. Maybe it won't.

The only person I feel bad for is Steven Gerrard. But, at the end of the day, he's a leader who didn't lead in this stretch run. In past years we could put our failings off on others but this year I think, to be where we were going into the Chelsea match, his error and then his complete loss of composure really doomed our team. And, today again, he didn't have it within him to marshall the squad when we gave up the first goal.

I think Rodgers holds blame for today (not for Chelsea though). But I think Gerrard can know that he is also why we lost our momentum. We can criticize our defense for many things but we are a club that had deficiencies going into the season that saw most people thinking 6th would be an ask for us. We were in the title race with those deficiencies. And in vital games, we fell apart because of them but also because we didn't shield ourselves from them. And some of that falls on the captain. He's the dictator of tempo from back there. To have allowed us to not batten down the hatches immediately falls on him for leadership and Rodgers for tactics.

Sad as it may be. And a lot of our more senior players completely lost their nerve. Lucas, Johnson, and Skrtel. 

And I realize I might get shit for saying all that. Because I'm certainly aware that Gerrard is a big reason why we were even in the title race this year.

Look for a bike that's cheaper to insure. Gixxers are super popular with thieves. As in, I would basically expect that bike to get stolen once every 18 months or so if it were parked in the street. 

A bike that's even a small step down on the performance pecking order will be a less glittering target and a lot cheaper to insure (Triumph is a good place to start).

[Find a garage near you to rent] (http://www.parklet.co.uk)

Wait a couple more years and don't make a claim, even if your bike gets stolen. IME five years no claims seems to be the big tipping point for motorcycle insurance to start really dropping.

At the time the police officer asked if I thought there might be any evidence that they could send CID to collect. I informed them that I doubted there would be, as it appeared all the thief had done is forced the door and grabbed the bike, the only item in the room at the time. Nevertheless a member of Norfolk's Finest was shortly on the phone and seeing, as he reasoned, it was a sunny day he asked if I didn't mind if he dropped by to see if there was any forensic evidence to be collected.

Less than an hour later I was standing in the garden chatting to the detective as he dusted for prints and checked for various other items of forensic evidence. After about an hour of work he informed me that, sadly, there was no evidence to be found and went off on his way.

- He got a yellow for spitting on Ballack in 05

- He then spat on a Hull assistant in the tunnel then denied both incidents.

- Used to say we were lucky whenever we beat them.

- Said Mourinho should shut up.

- Lampard comes in to stop a fight round about 06, Fabregas instead pulls on his shirt and tries to pull him down and start fighting him instead.

- Made fun of Di Matteo saying Chelsea are a long ball team laughing at us before our tie.

- Then says after losing the tie and us winning that Chelsea are lucky to win the CL.

- He made a meal of Chelsea fans bringing and tossing celery at games after which Celery was banned for our fans and never has been allowed again. Most of you wont even understand how big this is to our fans.

- We even have chants specifically calling him a cunt. Used to ring around the Bridge and Emirates, even took them to Spain.

- He was the most booed Barcelona player when we faced him too. 


It isn't a matter of him wanting to play for us. We aren't that fucking low to sign him nor will anyone at the club. You think Rafa was hated for saying a couple of things, Fabregas is twice the cunt he is. These are just things I remember from memory, I can find a lot more via google.


How are so many people here saying ""oh i &lt;3 him but he wont play 4 us"". Absolute bellends. You want to say the same about Gerrard if he was 20 times the cunt than he is now? Thats Fibreglass.

If you're there to work, first year is a joke. Try not to let it get to you, or the frustration and the stress will consume you and you'll be unable to enjoy yourself. It's not forever. 

Once you move out into a rented residence that *isn't* halls, two things happen:

1. you get a house that is *your own*, that you have to look after, and clean, and cook in, and it's awesome. Word of advice - pick who you live with VERY carefully. You're getting upset about some of the shit that happens in halls, if one of your housemates is a bit grubby it's going to REALLY piss you off and damage a friendship. Pick people who live like you to live with.

2. All the fucking dunces who came to uni to party for 3 years who have done zero work in the first year will drop out. Best part of this? They'll be gone and the people left are likely to have a slightly better work ethic. Worst part of this? The people who drop out will probably be earning more money than you with better career options for at least 2 years after you get out of uni.

What I learned from uni was more valuable than what I learned from my degree. I got a degree in advertising. Every job I want to go for requires a 'relevant degree'. That is the only thing it is useful for. My degree was incredibly broad and dealt with semantics, marketing and communication theory, media production, graphic and web design, film production... it's a 'cover all the bases' degree. When people go 'how is your degree relevant?' I can blag it. That is *literally* all it is good for. I barely remember any of the stuff I 'learned', and all the stuff my degree says I can do now, I could do before I went to uni. This bit of paper is just a bit of paper that says 'hey, sdtp can do all of the shit he says he can. And I should know; I cost £8000.' (Yes, my whole 3 year course cost £1000 less than one year of your course. I'm so sorry, really.)

But degree aside, I learned a lot from uni:

1. How to manage money and finances, budget for the future, what I need and what I want
2. How to cook for myself and others. Every sunday I'd cook a roast dinner for the house, by myself, my sous chefs peeling potatoes and prepping chicken
3. How to chill the fuck out. I learned that some shit just doesn't really matter. My housemate's beard trimmings covering the sink, the brown stains in the toilet bowl. The broken garden furniture. Seeing my breath in winter. Sweating at night in summer (but unable to open windows due to noise). None of that fucking matters. I had food in my belly, money in my bank, a bed to sleep in, clothes to keep me warm, and some solid company for when the lights go out due to our electricity getting cut off. We made basketball hoops out of drainpipes and bin lids. I heard my housemates fucking their girlfriends. I got in arguments about petty shit, and I learned to pull myself together and own up to my mistakes like a man.
4. How to work. My first year was, shamefully, as you described. Partying, experimenting with less-than-legal chemicals, keeping people awake, being kept awake. Second year calmed down. Third year, I had almost zero support regarding my dissertation. That was when it hit me - this is what uni *should* be like. It shouldn't be getting fucked up and getting laid. It should be teaching kids how to live by themselves, and work towards their goals without adult supervision. Unfortunately, it isn't like this, but sure. It should be. I left some work to the last minute, and it would all be fine, cause I gave myself enough time to do the work... but then I got really ill and it all went tits up. I knew then that success is creating goals, and steady continual work to achieve those goals.

As it stands, I don't want to work in advertising (currently a graphic designer in an advertising firm and I *hate* it). I'm training to be a ski instructor. That will cost thousands more... but it's what I want to do right now and for the foreseeable future. My degree will always be there, should I want to come back to it in the future, but the dumb thing is, after a few years, degrees are irrelevant, and experience is key. Do I regret uni? Eh. Not really. I regret not spending longer figuring out what I wanted to do, choosing a better university, choosing a more enjoyable, more 'lucrative' course. I regret jumping in head first without checking the depth of the water. Do I regret going to uni? Not one bit.

I think too many people go into uni for 'something to do' - a way to extend their teenage years with drink and debauchery away from supervising eyes. That isn't what uni should be. Not every should go to uni. I'm reminded of a quote from Game of Thrones that went something like this:

&gt;Not everyone is destined to be a knight. The realm needs candlemakers just as much as it needs knights.

**TL:DR uni isn't, nor should it be, for everyone. Work hard, play hard, use your time wisely to learn valuable life skills. Network, network, network. Your degree will be useful for getting you a job, and that's about it, but don't let that get you down. You get as much from uni as you put into it. Don't waste your time there by sitting around being sad about all the wasters breaking shit and pissing against your wall - go and join societies, make some great friendships, do some awesome activities, and don't fret about the small stuff. You only do uni once. Do I recommend going to uni? Not really. Did I have the time of my life? Absolutely. Would I do it again with the knowledge I have now? Probably not. Make of that what you will.**",0,1399369642,null,0,false,0,chatvvl,t3_24s9g9,t1_chatvvl,t3_24s9g9,null,1433672849,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

true,LordMondando,null,null,"It's actually not as stupid a fear as you think, most of popular Sci-fi has done a bad job of explaining it, and there is a lot of futurist noise about the issue of the kind 'well computers will eventually just get so fast they'll punch through to a new reality'.

In reality, intelligence is actually largely defined by skillful interaction with your environment. We tend to over mythologize our own intelligence 'humans can write symphonies ' kinda stuff, so any sort of A.I is going to be some godlike being that'll try to nuke us off instantly. there's also this silly idea that at some point, the chunks of the internet are just going to reach sentience, which misses the fact that most of the web is data retrieval/storage with very little cognition going on.

It's cognition that's the bit you have to watch for, its not a linear thing. But we are only just a complex system of cognitive tools made out of neurons for a organic machine to navigate and form strategies from abstractions about our environment. 

In reality, drone tech, is coming very close to having the sort of visual-motor 'ofmpf' and ability to navigate its environment thats going to approach non-mammalian intelligence fairly soon (so something like a lizard). Not really 'so' much of a worry. But its one of the major hurdles to true A.I overcome. Stupidly complex programs that brute force solutions by massive list/tree/etc searches are what we already have (look at google's search abilities these days). But thats not really how 'intelligence works'.

The next big hurdle nad maybe the last one is meta-state. The ability of an intelligence information to have states about states. It looks a lot like in animals, this largely goes on the neo-mamlarian cortex, and evolved from being social animals in most cases. Because you need to have states about mere observation of behavior (that other rat is higher on the social ladder than me, because its doing x) in order to have good complex social structure without offloading loads of cognition to just complex patterns of pheromones (which in ants etc have a lot of good points, but a lot of drawbacks when you can't afford loose hundreds of individuals as a matter of course). This gradually getting more complex is what gives you humans abiltiy to think abstractly and thus innovate.

And this, we might stumble on accidentally. A huge amount of work is going into the meta-analysis of data and automating that due to the problems of big data (just too much for people to look at). More pointedly, teaching machines that already are close on the first visual-motor point how to properly differentiate between civilian and possible military targets or finding a human body in rubble. Involves a fair bit of this.

If we start actually building it into the chips, or construct a fine grained enough system in software with descent enough  heuristic systems for expanding that in novels was. Then you might for all intents and purposes, end up with a system that can be properly called 'intelligent' in the same way a human can. Likely radically different mentally, but it been chauvinism to say it was not *intelligent*.

The issue comes, and why this is reasonable, as that is marketable as fuck. So we might end up quite easily, and rapidly filling our world with what is in effect mechanical slaves, some of them weaponised. This is not a good idea.

It needs to be handled a lot more carefully than that. 


**tl:dr** lot of the lay interpretations of the issue are mistaken about the nature of the issue of what, but they are not entirely misunderstanding the scope of the likelihood of serious practical and ethical issues arising over the next few decades. The very existence of organic intelligence, makes synthetic intelligence not a question of 'if' (though issues like the frame problem are potentially throwing current architectures out of contention) its a question of when.

You can't choose the people you're lumped with in first year, usually, so don't let it get you down. I found that it's far easier to relate to those on your course, with whom you are assured at least one mutual interest, than the random people you're thrown in with in halls.

With regards to teaching, one small thing I'd warn you of: The first year of university is *generally* regarded as far easier than A-levels. That's not necessarily to say that it's going to take a huge step up in difficulty next year, but given that you're doing a technical course, it might. A-level teaching teaches you to get the grades. University teaching is much wider and better than this, and a lot of the first year really is 'unlearning' the mindset you've been given. You should indeed be doing independent learning, but I know that's not easy when people are unwilling to even point you in the right direction. The library will always prove an easier place to learn than your room (particularly if your accommodation is as awful as described) if only for the fact that you're free of most distractions and have the reference material available.

It simply looking at trends on grapths of things like increasing processing power, then ignoring that indenfine expansion of thoues trends is basically ruled out by hard constraint on what we can build do 'cognative tasks' in virtue of physics.

Transistors can only get, so small. You can only put so many in a certain space. If you make a circuit too large, latency becomes too much of an issue.

Quantum computing, is thrown around a lot like science woo at the moment, because people think its capable of overcoming these problems. It can improve upon current technology, sure. But at no point can it fundamentally eliminate these problems. Entanglement is not a simple point to point transfer of information. Most quantum circuits are simply the same basic ideas (fun fact, we don't actually have to use binary with current tech, adding qubits and many possible states is not something thats completely beyond us now, it's just that two voltage levels has a lot less chance for error in interpretation than 3, or 4.) instantiated at a lower level. 

In short, is the array of technologies known as 'quantum computing' a better faster way of doing it, than making computers on a fundamental level about connected swathes of Silicon transistors. Yes. It is magic, no. You can only do so much computing, with matter. And the smaller it gets, the more problems you get this information not being where its supposed to be. The more throughput your after, the more heat becomes a problem. The large and more parrealised you make the system, the more problems you have with threading and data consistency.

true,Vesuviian,,Belfast,"It seems to me that if both sides of the community accuse the police of being biased towards 'themmums' then the police are doing a pretty good job of being impartial.

The RUC (the PSNI's predecessor) was widely perceived (correctly, in many cases) as being biased against the Catholic community in the run up to, and during, the Troubles.  It was largely made up of Protestants, and they enforced laws that were handed down by an apartheid-like Stormont.  Seamus Mallon (SDLP, former Deputy First Minister) called the RUC '97% Protestant and 100% Unionist.' 

After the Good Friday Agreement, the RUC was reformed into the PSNI through the Patten Report (Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland) which implemented a form of 'positive discrimination' in order to increase the number of Catholic police officers, and the creation of a bunch of organisations and bodies that would ensure police accountability.  Sinn Féin, in 2007, joined the other political parties in supporting the PSNI. 

The Patten Report went a long way to increasing the support of the PSNI amongst the Catholic community.  However, many are still suspicious of them because of things that have happened in the past - and their handling of historical cases has been criticised by Sinn Féin and the SDLP for being too in favour of prosecuting former IRA men, instead of equally going after members of the UVF, police officers who were involved in collusion, and members of the security forces who killed innocent people (like those soldiers involved in Bloody Sunday).  

The Protestant community became disillusioned with the RUC (and later PSNI) when they began enforcing bans on parades.  When the Parades Commission decides that a parade can't go ahead because it's offensive to Catholics in the area, or because of public safety, the PSNI are the ones who go down there and enforce that decision.  Or when Belfast City Council decides that the Union flag can only be flown on designated days, the PSNI are the ones who are there to maintain order during the protests.  Thus the PSNI become the visible representation of 'Protestant cultural oppression' - which is why you see in Protestant areas of Belfast graffiti calling the PSNI the PSNIRA.  

The PSNI are not perfect, no police service is, and we all have a long way to go, but I think they're on the right track.

Even r/liverpoolfc's resident chelsea downvote brigade are funny.

true,nocaph,eng-manchester,Greater Manchester,"This has been my world for the past 2 years, and still is to some extent.  I was actually asked if I wanted to go on BBC Breakfast to talk about my experience because of my staggeringly poor asthma care by a leading charity, but refused because I genuinely fear the repercussions of talking negatively about my doctors on national TV.  I've fought so hard to get the care I'm getting now, I don't have the luxury to make it harder for myself.

My asthma (adult-onset) was in all probability entirely preventable.  There's a lot of asthma in my family, and the scientific literature points to that being a predisposing factor.  

About two years ago I got an extremely nasty chest infection that wasn't treated with antibiotics for 3 months because of a confounding psychiatric misdiagnosis at the time.  The misdiagnosis (somatisation disorder, now defunct) came with instructions to not ""investigate or treat me unless absolutely necessary because it might make my [""psych""] condition worse"".  Therefore I was kept at an arm's distance by anyone below Consultant level.  The only way I got around it was by seeing a nurse practitioner at Out of Hours who seemed shocked that my chest was full of crackles and rhonchi sounds when my GP said it was ""clear"" a few hours earlier.  By then the inflammation was so bad that it had triggered the asthma, and it was never to go away completely.

There was a problem with my normal peak flow being at least 900, when the average for my age and height is about 600.  I think most doctors don't realise that when they say a ""normal"" peak flow, they mean an ""average"" peak flow.

This carried on for well over a year - I couldn't breathe properly all day, every day.  When I presented at A&amp;E with a peak flow of 500 (almost 50% of MY normal), they said ""well it looks like your breathing's okay now"" and discharged me.  When I insisted my normal peak flow &gt;900, the doctor literally ignored me.  I had chest infection after chest infection, without a break.  I even got escorted off the premises by security on the request of the same doctor twice (once when querying whether my months of lying down + coughing up blood might be a DVT, then asking for a second opinion, the other time DURING a massive panic attack). 

Coughing up blood, chronic pain, constantly being refused antibiotics because my chest usually sounds QUIET rather than having abnormal sounds when I have an infection, and the misleading peak flow averages. 

I considered, and even attempted suicide on numerous occasions.  It's very difficult when you're in your early-mid 20s, already have depression, and then you're out of breath every night just trying to sleep, in pain so much you've forgotten what not being in pain feels like.  Oh and no one will treat you.  And the asthma nurse doesn't know what an asthma action plan is.

It's now about 2 years later.  Since the original infection wasn't treated in time, I'm stuck with this very difficult to treat asthma (I'm on the maximum dose of inhaled steroids they can get away with, daily prophylactic antibiotics, leukotriene receptor antagonist, regular painkillers etc).  

I'm debilitated by this on a daily basis, despite it being as under control as it can be.  There are so many, many things I can't do anymore, physically and mentally.  Faced with knowing this is the quality of the rest of my life, the Psychiatrist has done well to give me a depression and a disillusionment with life that's far more engrained now than it originally was.

**tldr: Developed entirely preventable severe asthma because I received astoundingly poor care over a period of almost two years, attempted suicide a few times.  Went from a relatively healthy 23 year old to a 25 year old with chronic breathing difficulties, chronic pain and even more severe depression.

true,devineman,logo,,"The key here is that City own the image rights of all of their players unlike many other Clubs.

When you see Joe Hart talking about anti-dandruff shampoo or razors, Head and Shoulders and Gillette are giving City money rather than Hart directly.  When he saves a penalty in a chocolate bar commercial, Mars are throwing money City's way.

For a long time I've spoken about the absolute genius of an idea that is the City Football Group.  Manchester City are in the European timezone and have numerous commercial contacts through UEFA competitions and their own business team.  NYCFC are in the biggest commercial market in the biggest English speaking sector of the Americas timezones.  Melbourne are one of the biggest commercial markets in the biggest English speaking sector of the Asian timezones.  And of course we already have the Middle East wrapped up nicely.

It's one of the reasons why I think many on /r/soccer are so small minded when it comes to City and what they are trying to achieve.  They call the CFG ""a way to dodge FFP"" which is so blinkered, it's unfathomable.

Does anybody here play chess?  I've always enjoyed a good game of chess though I'm not very good at it, but I enjoy teaching the kids the basics of the game.  One of the life lessons that you learn from chess is that if you attempt to attack the King directly, the opposition will park the bus then counter attack you whilst you're weak.  The trick is to slowly move your pieces into the correct position over time, patiently and diligently going about your business until the time comes to strike and you conquer the board in an attack nobody sees coming.

This is what City are doing.  We've put a bishop in Melbourne.  A knight in New York.  Our King is safe in Manchester. 
The attack will come several years from now, maybe a decade.  When NYCFC and Melbourne are both set up, are successful and are generating revenue, we will sell package commercial deals for sums that will blow away absolutely every other deal in global football many times over.  That's our checkmate in my opinion.

Lionel Messi would help us achieve this goal.  Forget football reasons for a minute, which is almost insulting to Messi I know.  Messi is an interesting case study.  Who is the biggest commercial powerhouse in the world of football?  David Beckham, a player who was great but not legendary.  The smart people are asking why Lionel Messi is not as big a brand as David Beckham and it comes down to the fact that nobody learnt any lessons from Beckham's immense management of his brand.  Football is so adverse to change that it's mad at times.  Beckham, despite being a retired football, STILL is the top earning football brand according to that company who releases the figures yearly.

City can give Messi access to a global marketplace in a manner which Barca currently cannot.  There's the difference between having a guy in Spain pick up a phone to a guy in New York and having a whole commercial office in New York stocked full of executives who know how their marketplace works.  This is why the Yankees are so important to the NYCFC idea, as they already have major contacts in the New York marketplace.  City have major commercial offices now in Manchester, London, New York, Abu Dhabi, and Melbourne.  We could make him bigger than Beckham.  And all of that lovely revenue would flow back into us.

Messi would have to be well compensated in his wage and bonus structures.  Maybe even cut him in for a percentage?

As far as the transfer fee goes, Soriano has already stated on record that this financial year City will be breaking even at least.  This is to be expected, our wage bill had numerous exceptional items including the cost of sacking Mancini and his staff who were all on new contracts and other wages that won't be here this year.  We developed a whole new stadium, Academy and offices that cost money and nobody seems to have pointed out.  The TV deal has risen by between 50% and 100% depending on the figures you believe.

Due to the way that amortisation of a transfer fee works, Messi would cost us around £30m a year with maybe £20m in wages.  £50m a year on one player.

However, the extra revenue he would bring from new commercial deals would pay about £10m of that absolutely immediately with a huge potential for growth.    The extra interest he would generate in the City brand is just as valuable for negotiating our own commercial deals (remember, most commercial deals are based on visibility).  Then there's the footballing cost.  Messi would definitely help us reach the further goals in the Champions League and Premier League which in turn raises our revenue.

I've seen people say that the Messi deal will pay for itself.  I think this is a little optimistic.  I do think that the total cost to our books will end up being about £20m a year which is about what Barry and Lescott are costing us in wages and amortisation.

The other big point here though is that if we did sign Messi, UEFA would suddenly become our bestest best mates and all that talk of reducing CL squads would go straight out of the window.  All we have to say is ""ok, well Messi is our highest earner so we'll cut him from the squad"".  They'd have a fucking heart attack if that happened.

Realistically, City can afford Messi and it helps us achieves our goals on and off the pitch.  It helps NYCFC and MHFC too if we're willing to share him around commercially the group to help kickstart their own commercial positions.  Whilst it would represent a bit more of a risk than usual transfers, if we did manage to pull it off (and there's no guarantee that we will either in transfer terms or in growth terms) it would accelerate the development of the CFG by several years.",0,1399372274,null,0,false,0,chau9sd,t3_24ulx7,t1_chau9sd,t1_chats8n,null,1433673032,19,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,19

Article 6(1) says that the EU's own Charter of Fundamental Rights applies, 6(2) that the EU will sign up to the ECHR and 6(3) that the ECHR shall be guiding principles of EU law.

That doesn't quite mean that the Member States are required to apply ECHR law in all cases, though. As with the Charter, I think that it would only apply when interpreting EU law, not purely domestic law. In theory a Member State could sign up to the ECHR, join the EU, then leave the ECHR and ECHR law would only apply to the parts of their law that come from the EU.

But it is all rather silly - why wouldn't a modern democracy want to be committed to protecting the fundamental rights of its people?

No unfortunately its a massive leap. Because as noted, the more complex a cognitive system gets is largely a function of its structural complexity. The more structural complexity the more problems you get. Again, just have to keep going back to heat, look at an intel 8086, not an issue. Look at a i5 3440 and its a massive problem. Look at the human brain, needs to stay in a sweet spot of 2-3 c or suffers irrecoverable damage in seconds. 

Something orders of magnitude greater, have to basically remove issues like electron tunneling harming data consistency and causing safety errors in opeartions( i.e electron or whatever A, Jumps across into process pipeline Y, when it should be in X -this then makes the result of that operation not what is expected. A far more serious problem than it sounds), or heat diseption (don't care what the circuit is made out of, run it too hot, whatever your using as the substrate of information has to move, and it will be capable of whacking ions/atoms out of the lattice which there in, think of it like slowly destroying a pillar by shooting at it_.

&gt;At which point, it takes over and starts figuring out how to improve itself.

Again dude this is just the 'godmachine' fallacy. Not to mention on a simple conceptual level, how does one go about improving your core cognative systems *whilst* your using them.

&gt;I imagine there's a fair amount of dumb inefficiency in our brains given how we essentially evolved using trial and error.

Not really, the brain is INCREADIBLY energy hungry, there is a HUGE selection pressure to have it running as efficent as possible at anytime. In certain respects like setting the frame of a concept, we are still many orders of magnitude ahead of machines and this is a sigificant problem (aka the frame problem) that still has to be overcome, if it indeed can be. 

Hell you even see organisms that will atrophere their entire brain if they no longer need to navigate their entire enviroment.

There is no tolerance for inefficeny in the brain.

You basically making a mistaken assumption that silicon (or whatever, graphine etc) is inherently better than using water, proteins and fatty acids.

It's not. There is literally no good reason to be belive that at all. Many good reasons from state of the art A.I reserch to believe otherwise. As noted, at best in the next 20 years we make in effect something of lizard intelligence, in terms of actual 'in the world' inteligence, not simply something that churns insanely complex algorithms on a data set.

The problem is, fees have gone up partly because funding has gone down, so it doesn't really stack up. A lot of lecturers are really only teaching because they can get the money to do the other stuff they want to do like writing books (which obviously they then peddle to the students- one of my lecturers was notorious for this.)

I thought uni was worth it but I hated living in halls. If you've had a sheltered life then it does seem to be an excuse to go a bit OTT when you first start living on your own. At least that's what it seemed like to me when looking at the people I had to live with.

 University is what you make it for the most part. I got more work done in cafes and my room than I ever did in the library and kept to myself for a lot of the time. But then that let me focus on my work and I did go on to get a decent grade.


In terms of bookprices it is ridiculous but sites like ABbooks and, errm, other avenues *cough piratebay cough* are good at beating that. My library was tiny so I had to fight for the books I needed, meaning I had to get creative in other ways. You can also use Google to get lecture notes from other universities- that helped massively when my lecturer was shit.

The group damage thing was probably written on your contract upon entering into halls though, so although it sucks it's up to all of you to ensure the communal areas are maintained.

But yeah. You can spend 3 years bitching about it or you can find parts of it you do like and focus on them. Flatshare with mature students next year or lodge somewhere if you don't get on with people your own age. Uni isn't perfect but the outside world isn't either.

How does that follow. Just because I can remove for example, parts of your lanauge center. Hell using TMS I can shut off your ability to see that numbers are larger or smaller, but *not* different*. Does it follow that

1) These modular cognative abilities do not confer a selective advantage
2) That they have been selected for to be relatively inefficent. 

Also note, and I thought I was being clear, but it could be my unclarity here. I was making a point from the get go in dintiguishing different types of inteligent behavior of a system, to underline the fact its not just a unitary Brain or CPU which produces 'inteligence'.


&gt;I'm not talking about 20 year time frames here. I'm talking hundreds of years.. I think it's completely insane to think we won't be able to do anything given enough time, let alone simulate a human brain.

And I think every prediction about the future state of technology based on current trends is at best conjecture, at worth lolflyingcars.

Unless there are good reasons now, to think that these fundametnal problems, caused by fundmental laws of physics itself. Then your definitely more on the flying cards side. 

&gt;I fear the singularity in the same way I fear global warming. It won't actually affect me, but it will the human race.

Bad example, because global warming is not a bit down the line and rests entirely on non-contencious science (its just heavily and badly politisied).

The best argument for the singularity tends to revolve around.

1) Look at that line trend on that grapth of computing throughput in (x)flops / time. It's a linear increase guess that will just keep on going.
2) A sort of whiggish interpretation of human progresss, in that since such amazing progress was made from pre-industrial to today, we are going to continue going at this pace.

As i've said, the information consistency and heat issues, are fundamental hard breaks on that when it comes to computational power. 

There is no good reason to dispense with thouse, and with respect, your not providing any.

&gt;You're using current material science and current material theories to poo poo the idea

I'm using science yes. Which though it has large unanswered questions, like the nature of dark matter or dark energy, does not have good reasons to believe that prohemenon like electron tunneling will just stop *or* fundamenals like thermodynamics are open to revision.

&gt;but we really have no idea what the future has in store.

**No, No, No, No, NO!**.
You *cannot* do that, you cannot move from establishing agnoistism about the state of knowledge in the domain of a field, then use it for your particular model of how the world will be. you cannot move from general skepticism to a positive argument. That's a subtle rhetorical device that gets thrown around a bit, but its a complete non-sequitor. 

If we just don't know, then all futurism has its conclusions in just as problematic a state. If your first premise is true, its just as likely that I am still right, or that magic unicorns could enter from the n'th dimension. It's not, we just don't know 'therefore the theory of singularity is likely'

That is all kinds of fallcious.

&gt;

&gt;There was little preparation for the conflict with Germany.  However at the time Lord Craigavon, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland since its inception in 1921, said: ""Ulster is ready when we get the word and always will be."" He was asked, in the N.I. parliament: ""if the government realized 'that these fast bombers can come to Northern Ireland in two and three quarter hours' "". His reply was: “We here today are in a state of war and we are prepared with the rest of the United Kingdom and [Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire) to face all the responsibilities that imposes on the [Ulster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster) people. There is no slacking in our loyalty.”

&gt;Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, simply refused to reply to army correspondence and when the Ministry of Home Affairs was informed by imperial defence experts that Belfast was a certain *Luftwaffe* target, nothing was done. 

&gt;Belfast, the city with the highest population density had the lowest proportion of air-raid shelters. Prior to the ""Belfast Blitz"" there were only 200 public shelters, although 4,000 households had built their own shelters. No searchlights were set up, as they had only arrived on 10 April. There were no night-fighters. On the night of the raid, no [Royal Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force) (RAF) aircraft took to the air. There were only 22 anti-aircraft guns, six light, and sixteen heavy. On the night, only seven were operated for a short time. There was no smokescreen ability. There were some [barrage balloons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrage_balloon).

&gt;These air-raid shelters were [Anderson shelters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raid_shelter#Anderson_shelter). They were sheets of [corrugated galvanised iron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrugated_galvanised_iron) covered in earth. Since most casualties were caused by falling masonry rather than by blast, they provided effective shelter for those who had them.

&gt;Unlike other British cities, few children had been evacuated. The ""Hiram Plan"" initiated by Dawson Bates, the Home Affairs Minister, had failed to materialise. Fewer than 4,000 women and children were evacuated. There were still 80,000 more in Belfast. Even the children of soldiers had not been evacuated, with calamitous results when the married quarters of Victoria Barracks received a direct hit.

&gt;From papers recovered after the war, we know of a *Luftwaffe* reconnaissance flight over Belfast on 30 November 1940. The Germans established that Belfast was defended by only seven anti-aircraft batteries, which made it the most poorly defended city in the United Kingdom. From their photographs, they identified suitable targets:

&gt;


&gt;* Harland and Wolff Ltd shipyard

&gt;* *Die Tankstelle* Conns Water

&gt;* Short and Harland aircraft factory

&gt;* The power station of Belfast

&gt;* Rank &amp; Co mill

&gt;* Belfast waterworks

&gt;* Victoria Barracks

&gt;

Farming became mechanised, making vast numbers of labourers unemployed and the lords richer - but it didn't end there. New markets appeared for manufactered goods, which employed more people. The population increased because the farms were more productive and it was easier to ship produce long distances.

Factories have improving their efficency constantly since the start of the industrial revolution, using fewer people to make more stuff and making the bosses richer - but every time the total size of the economy has grown, proving better jobs for more people.

Landlords are a business just like any other, they don't want people ""stealing"" their product, many are on a tight margin and a couple of months rent missing means food off their own children's plates. The last landlord who I rented a house off, that rent was 60% of the guy's income, he couldn't afford to run his car until he got a tenant!

You will also be required to register your car in the UK and it will have to have modifications to the head lights to convert them to the correct beam pattern and the turn signals to be compliant - stop lights have to be a steady light and direction indicators orange. It will be required to have an annual inspection (MOT) once its more than 3 years old and also a vehicle excise license which is quite expensive for a Mustang.

Winters are relatively mild here, sub -10C is rare. This last winter where I live we had no snow at all. Summer is an average of high teens. To someone from the southern states our summer will probably feel like spring/fall to you.

I love the Ford Mustang and the 2005- is on my list of cars to own. I've had left hand drive cars before so understand the shortfalls. The V6 is affordable to run here as a daily driver in the UK but the V8 isn't. 

You can buy 2005- Mustangs here in the UK for around £20,000. Other than that if you're prepared to have a car say 4 or 5 years old, the large engined ones depreciate like hell so make bargains. As we have a far far stricter set of regulations in regards to vehicle standards with the annual inspections a 4 or 5 year old car is likely to be in better condition than its American counterpart. Diesels are quite popular here and cheaper to run if you're likely to be doing more than 15,000 miles a year.

Oh and as a final comment we don't have lube changes every time we go to Walmart to do the weekly shopping. Most vehicles here in the UK are on around 10,000 mile oil changes and there's really no need to do it more often than that. My Ford Mondeo is on 12,500 mile oil changes and I sold my last one with 165,000 miles on it. 

Edit: You talked about car park spaces. My current 2010 Ford Mondeo is sold as the Ford Taurus in the USA. Its considered a largish car here and I have problems with being able to open the doors enough to get out of the car in typical British car parks as they all seem to have narrow bays nowadays.

I'm Maggie Parke, and I work at Bangor Uni talking to American students about coming to Bangor-- so I thought I'd put my two cents in!

There's a lot of comments on here that I have to say I don't quite agree with (I've lived here for ten years and don't have a car-- you don't need one, and everywhere out of Cardiff is not equivalent to rednecks), but I'm glad there's a lot of comments to help you get a feel for the place. Keep in mind that a lot of people don't actually know this place though-- they're commenting on what they think of the place/have heard about it!

I'm American, from Pennsylvania, and came here for a semester as an undergrad. I loved it. Absolutely loved it. I had the best semester of my life on the sea, in the mountains, with friendly people, in an affordable place, with easy access via direct trains to Chester, London, Cardiff, Manchester, and Liverpool. 

I came back to do my MA, stayed for a PhD in Film, and am now Dr. Maggie Parke, and the Uni hired me to help other students from North and South America come study in Wales (I also still work in film though).

So if you've questions, do drop me an email and I'm happy to set up a skype chat with you: maggie.parke@bangor.ac.uk  I'm also in the States a lot, so depending where you live I can chat with you in person, too. 

And info for US students: http://www.bangor.ac.uk/international/countries/usa/

In my opinion it's awesome, but you've gotta get a feel for the place through whatever means you can. It's beautiful, safe, affordable, and a great education, especially in a few key areas.

Talk to you soon, and do let me know what other questions you guys in the reddit community might have!

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"The problem here is two-fold.

Firstly the benefits system is terribly inefficient in terms of the time it takes to change anything.  I'm not completely sure this is the case for housing benefit, but for many benefits your benefit is just stopped when you advise of a change of circumstances and it can be several weeks until it resumes.  

I rent privately and don't receive any benefits, but I would be surprised if if my rent was more than a couple of days late I didn't start getting stroppy phone calls from the letting agent.I can't even fault my landlord for this.  The agreement between us is that I pay him money on or before the second day of each month and I get to live in his property.  If I don't pay and pay on time, it's entirely reasonably for him to get antsy about it.

The second thing is the practicality of legislating against discrimination.  It's illegal to discriminate on gender.  You might find it distasteful but many small employers **do** discriminate against women when considering who to employ.  They don't write on the application form, *""Female:  Likely to get pregnant and take off on maternity leave!""* in red biro, but they do it.  If pushed they would tell you, *""The man I employed was the best candidate.""* or even more nebulously, *""I felt the man I employed was a better fit for our corporate culture.""*

Setting aside the specific issue of housing benefit:  Imagine that you and I apply to rent the same flat.  You turn up for the showing in a suit and note that you're an accountant on the application.  I turn up in a scratty t-shirt and state that I'm a market trader.  Do you not suppose that many landlords would prefer to take you in?

On top of this, think about it in the context of the current, *""Your benefits may be stopped if you refuse a zero-hours contract job!""* thing!  You're renting and the guy at the Job Centre says you **must** take the zero-hours job.  You take it, because you have no choice.  Now they only give you four hours a day - In two split shifts!  You don't get paid enough to pay the rent and the split shifts mean you can't even find a second job in the other part of the time.  Your landlord doesn't get paid and this is no fault of his.  To be fair no fault of yours either.

So, in conclusion  - No, I don't think it should be illegal for landlords and letting agents to discriminate.

That would be a plaster stuck on the wrong part of the problem.  The core problem needs to be addressed and that means more housing.",0,1399377717,null,0,false,0,chavag2,t3_24ut67,t1_chavag2,t3_24ut67,null,1433673512,17,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,17

When we actually did concede, his first action should have been to bring in Agger, as we had been overrun a couple of times and were lucky not to have conceded earlier. The midfield of Lucas and Gerrard is not athletic enough, and don't cover enough ground, so he should have had them play next to each other, with Allen in front. Instead of Lucas and Allen more on the left and right, with Gerrard behind them. 

Don't get me wrong, the initial tactics to start off with was good and so was the execution early in the 2nd half, but you have to adjust and do better at in game management, when your team looked as tired and as sloppy as they did. 

Also, while I hate pointing fingers, a lot of the blame goes to Skrtel and Johnson, who lost their heads and made some crucial mistakes, that veterans shouldn't do. Johnson just fucking stood there while the attacker was running at him full speed and only started running after he went past him. He should have been clinical and brought him down right there.

true,notDvoiduRlooKin4,null,null,"That was fucking stupid. So fucking stupid. I mean what the hell are they thinking? We literally have NO CHANCE of beating city on goal difference. Before this match, assuming that city win all their games, we would need to close an 11 goal gap (assuming they win their games by 1 goal each), that is NOT going to happen, lets also remember that City have not lost any match this season by more than 1 goal, both their top goal scorers are in the squad and they are pretty much just as good as us at scoring goals.

Sure we lack depth and don't have a billionaire backing the club, but that doesn't give us the right to say we deserved it, fact is, we had our chances and we flopped. We had a very good shout at winning the league this year. The loss to Chelsea was very unlucky with the slip, but that was never the end of it. However, this match is a BIG, BIG problem. NO DISCIPLINE. Gerrard mate, what the fuck are you doing? This is the time to tell the team to keep their cool and take the 3 points. Most of these players have never played in a game like this with so much on the line, this is the time where real leadership and real experience comes into play. Not attack like rabid dogs and leave your defenders in 2v2/outnumbered situations. And sure the midfield fucked up in this respect, but the defense did fuck all as well here, letting them run in dangerous positions very easily.

I feel that Henderson would be the difference here, but he didn't do himself any favours with his challenge, a disappointing finish to a phenomenal season for him.

Pathetic display towards the end of the match, discipline, discipline discipline. This is why we dominated Arsenal and destroyed a lot of the teams just outside of the top 4, everyone applies so much defensive pressure that they end up giving up possession and its already too late because suarez or sturridge have found the back of the net.

There is still SOME hope. The top of La Liga is also tight, and all 3 top teams dropped points against much weaker opposition. Roma just lost 4-1 to a team in 20th spot. But manchester city are a much stronger team than us, they have dropped points of course, but they have never really crumpled for full matches and actually control/dominate games far more often than us.

Yes, at the start of the season, I'd love 2nd spot. But seeing us (most likely) lose out as a result of such poor decision making is frustrating as. Amazing season, a fair amount of players really established themselves as quality youngsters (Sturridge, Coutinho, Sterling, Henderson), Flanagan came in and made a decent name for himself. Gerrard was at it yet again, Skrtel played a big role, and of course motherfucking Suarez showed the world what happens when you give the king a little bit of service, could break the record (I'll just note that both Shearer and Ronaldo had 3-4 penalties and both had 34-35 apps). And its not just him either, hopefully we will break the 100 goal mark, I wonder what the odds of that were before the season started.

if you managed to read through this wall of shit then I congratulate you on making it this far, and fair play to city who I hope win the title if we don't. They are a good team that have spent, but are playing some excellent football and bringing their best every where they go, be it against us or bayern.",0,1399378042,null,0,1399378692,0,chavd3h,t3_24t1l5,t1_chavd3h,t3_24t1l5,null,1433673547,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,collinsl02,null,null,"Sorry if any of these have been answered already, but here is my take:

&gt; Weather: the most obvious one for convertibles. I'm used to sun about 8 months a year, and I know England won't have that. How are temperature averages? My car is comfortable to drive in the 20-30C range. How do winters tend to go when it comes to driving?

You will have to keep the top on the whole time unless you want the car to be flooded or you want to be frozen to death, sorry. Temperatures in winter never really get above 16^o C and will rarely go above 12.

&gt; Size: I understand that English roads and European cars tend to be much smaller than those of the States. Parking lots/spaces are even smaller. My car is sized somewhere between a BMW 3- and 5-series sedan, for reference. How will it fare?

That should be just about OK - lots of people have larger BMWs, Mercedes etc.

&gt;Roads: Followup to last, generally how is the road quality in eastern England? Potholes and sports cars are natural enemies.

Depends on where you need to go. Roads in Britain fall into 4 basic classes:

* Motorways - the equivalent of the US interstate system, these are generally in decent repair although there are some surfaces that may be challenging - for instance the inside lanes tend to get worn down by lorries (trucks) and you may notice slight depressions in the road where their wheel ruts are in the road surface. There are also some motorways that have high water runoff surfaces (generally laid in the 80s/90s) which are composed of concrete grooves and peaks perpendicular to the direction of travel. These of course produce a large vibration effect in any car but they may be particularly noticeable in cars with hard suspension. I don't think there are many of these surfaces left though.
* A roads - these are ""main roads"" that are the real arteries of the country. They are generally decent roads, normally with a single lane in each direction but on occasion they are ""dual carriageways"" where there are two lanes in at least one direction (sometimes on hills there are two lanes up and one down so people can pass slow lorries). These roads are generally in decent shape, although it depends on the road and the area - there are major A roads and minor A roads - the minor ones may have potholes and sometimes uneven patching on the road surface. 
* B roads - these are smaller roads that are generally narrower than A roads, and they don't get as much of the repair budget as they are more lightly used. They can have significant potholes, poor quality patching repairs, and are generally in what I would describe as poor condition.
* Unclassified roads - these are small country lanes that sometimes follow old farmer's tracks, or the walking routes from the middle ages. Generally in poor to atrocious condition, these roads may have significant potholes and are generally about 1 and a half cars wide at maximum so they have ""lay-bys"" where you can pass oncoming traffic - you may have to reverse to one of these depending on who has further to go to one or whether you come up against a tractor. These roads can be useful cut-throughs if you know the area but they are generally used for farm traffic, local residents, horse riders and cyclists. Avoid these roads if at all possible, whatever car you have.

&gt; Steering: American-styled car vs British-styled traffic. Daily struggle or easily overcome?

As long as your turning circle is better than a warship you should be OK. ;-)

&gt; 'MURICA: A big V8 American sports car seems like it will scream ""HEY LOOK AT ME, I'M AMERICAN, GETTING FREEDOM ALL OVER EVERYTHING!"" I'm proud of my home, but there is value in blending in at times. Will the car attract undue attention? Or no one cares?

Your car will attract attention if it is obviously American - read: US plates, ""wrong"" side steering wheel, deer strapped to the bonnet (hood) etc ;-) but most of the time people will just think ""oh, an American car. I wonder what deal the supermarket will have on washing powder when I go in today?"" You might attract more attention from thieves, but the rule over here anyway is don't leave anything valuable in the car, whatever car you have.

&gt; Gas: How many of my various limbs will I have to sell on the black market to fill up the tank?

Lots and lots. Fuel over here is over $12 per gallon (after taking in to account the difference in size of a gallon between the UK and the USA) so unless you start selling kidneys now I think you will be in trouble ;-)

&gt; Buying a car in England: It seems like the combination of the value of the pound and the ease of shipping makes cars that are usually very expensive in the US (BMWs, Mercedes, Volvos, etc) much more affordable. What would be a good deal for a reasonably priced car that needs to last two years or so?

You could probably get a decent small car (Seat Ibiza or so) for about £1800 if you go for an older model. Cars from the less well known manufacturers tend to be cheaper and will last that long with a decent resale price most of the time. Just have a good google on sites like autotrader and look at a car brand and model on sites like which car to find out if they are any good.

My final thought: Personally I wouldn't ship the car over - you would likely have to meet a lot of government rules for it to be allowed in, it might need an MOT depending on it's age and whether or not you decide to register it here, fuel will cost a ton, and you will likely pay more to ship it here and back than you would spend on storing it in the US (not selling it) and buying a cheap old car here.",0,1399378532,null,0,false,0,chavh83,t3_24td76,t1_chavh83,t3_24td76,null,1433673600,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,stickerface,uk,Bristol/Bedford,"Yeah fair enough, I was thinking that he was asking ""shall I make a collage of all the topics?"" Rather than ""how can I structure my time?"" When revising I would typically have two lecture courses spread over two days, half of one course in the morning and half of the other in the afternoon. This stopped me reaching saturation with either and kept me interested in what I was doing. Also, I made a point of covering a lecture per session- regardless of content. This was hard on the more content rich courses but actually made the breaks so much sweeter, and sometimes powering through made me understand things better since the precious material is still fresh in your mind. One lecture typically requires two hours work, so a brief break in the middle is reasonable. Cut off the internet or use it as a reward between working sessions. Reward yourself with a beer and TV in the evening to allow yourself time to relax so you can actually sleep. Working then just going to bed is bad sleep hygiene and you will sleep poorly.

I aimed to copy out all lecture notes twice in full, then immediately go on to problem classes so cement the intricacies of the course in my mind. Then reduce notes to a cruib sheet or two. Once this is done you can go onto past papers. A good thing to do is revise with friends so you get very thorough answers to questions on papers. There are a limited number of ways they can ask about a topic every year and learning the absolute best way to answer that question is key to high marks.

This is just my opinion, but artificially restricting yourself to 25 minute sessions or a time limit is bad. It means you can linger on a topic too long (the converse is that my method might make you want to skip ahead but hey, nobody's perfect).


This is the method that got me through my degree. Everyone is different and it is hard to get motivated sometimes - the horror of finals has permanently put me off doing another degree.

&gt;*how am i wrong on this? your 12/13 losses were about £50m.*

They were but those losses included the construction of the Academy/stadium, some exceptional wage items from management change and didn't include the new Premier League TV deal.  [Our CEO says that we'll break even this year on revenues of over £330m](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/02/11/uk-soccer-england-city-finance-idUKBREA1A18220140211).  You can essentially think of City right now as a company breaking even.


&gt;*you are already looking at a £50m fine over 3 years*

This fine, which may not even happen, would not affect the balance sheet and is paid by the owner.


&gt;*plus the need to bring in players whom you actually need*

It's a pretty simple one in and one out system.  You have to remember that the two biggest costs to City right now are wages and amortisation.  

Lescott alone costs us £11m a year in wages and amortisation. Mangala presuming the rumoured £20m fee and £80k wages which is around what Negredo, Navas and Fernandinho got give or take 20k either way would cost us £8m a year.  We save £3m and replace Lescott with a better player.

Sagna coming in for Richards would only mean a rise of £20k a week in wages or £1m a year extra
Dzeko costs us £14m a year which you would have to think will go if Messi comes in.  That's an immediate cost transference.
Barry is costing us around £8m a year.  That's a cost that City no longer have.

The transfer business side is actually a major advantage to City because we overpaid in a period where we needed players more than they needed us.  So our existing players are pricey in amortisation and wage costs and we actually tend to lower costs by replacing players strangely.

&gt;*especially given that £42m of last year's income was down to a one off sale of image rights*

true,greater_golem,null,null,"I see it as the only sensible way to raise elite talent. The current development league is much better than what we've had before, though there is still a huge gulf between u21 football and the sort of competition players get on loan. 

Unfortunately, loans are limited by the playing style of the team and the incentives of the receiving club (e.g. they want talent at a cheap price to fill in wherever required, not necessarily what the player requires - look at how many loans have turned out to be for squad depth only.)

Were we able to forge a competitive Chelsea B (and C, hopefully!) side then we could see the following outcomes:

* A large increase in the difficulty level - making the jump to the first team that much smaller
* Retention in loyalty to the club (i.e. no conflict between CFC and loan club)
* Experience in the style and formations of the first team
* Continuation of team-building (e.g. no need to break up that Swift/Baker/Loftus-Cheek trio that works so well together at u21)
* Continued tutelage from some of the best in the business, i.e. with all respect to coaches at other clubs, if their coaches were better than ours than we would hire them.
* Easier qualification for Homegrown status - as currently enjoyed in Spain, the Champion's League still counts B-teams as being the same club.
* Better development of UK-based players. For reasons best discussed elsewhere, UK players are less likely to play abroad, therefore those players are less likely to get quality loans (e.g. Vitesse). As a result, young British players will disproportionally benefit from B-teams.

Of course, there are some downsides, though they relate to other clubs in the football league. The argument is that B-teams will cannibalise the attendance and viewership of the other teams in the league, as well as ""use up"" promotion slots. Arguably, this could lead to multiple lower league clubs going out of business. Historically, the football league has viewed the downsides to be worse than the upsides.

Best advice I can give - or if I were to interview you what I like to see is - a passion for technology but also problem solving. Even if you're nervous it doesn't matter if you make minor/syntax mistakes so long as you show understanding of what you're doing. 

I interview one guy last week who knew what a singleton was (I asked him for a design pattern he was familar with) and I asked him to implement a rough and ready copy. He couldn't, but the killer was that he really put little effort in trying to talk it through, I was dragging him through it which made me think he really didnt have a clue (that and his written technical scores were not great).

The another guy said he thought recursion was bad. So, I tried to get him to discuss why he thought it was bad and how he might, for example, implement the classic Fibonnci sequence without recursion. He mumbled something about using dictionaries and then didnt answer much else. 

One guy i did hire, made a load of mistakes, but acknowledged them and suggested how he might correct it and I'm glad I did he is now a solid developer and contriubuting a lot.

And there has been many problems as a result. So much so that a new [team] (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9210312/NHS-team-to-test-English-of-foreign-doctors.html) has been set up within the NHS to ensure that foreign born doctors are up to the standards expected of British born doctors. 

Why do we need to rely of immigrants to perform these jobs anyway? Surely we can predict what sort of needs will be required in the job market in the long term and do things to encourage people here to take up these roles. 

Another negative effect has been that so many medical staff from poorer countries have been coming here that it is having a [negtive](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/britains-reliance-on-foreign-health-staff-blamed-for-crisis-in-poor-countries-8919980.html) effect on the provision of medical treatment in the countries they are coming from. Does this not show that the way we are doing things currently is not fair or sustainable?

true,ViridianPanther,cyberman,Cyberperson,"A synthesiser is specifically something that's capable of creating a *range* of different noises, by altering the timbre, waveform, filtering, envelope and also what’s known as the ‘low frequency oscillator’ (i.e. alters it slightly to add vibrato, tremolo, etc.)

The wobbulator/oscillator is only one *component* of this, because on its own it’s only capable of making a sine, sawtooth or square wave at different pitches. To make it capable of making different ‘noises', you need to be able to add the sound from multiple oscillators together (and also to be able to subtract them)—it’s just a process of adding and subtracting waveforms. You also need filtering (which amplifies, passes or attenuates different frequencies in the sound—e.g. you can filter out the lower frequencies to make it sound more hollow) and also to be able to control what’s known as the ‘envelope’ which affects how the sound behaves over time. The filtering is what controls how the sound behaves over time—i.e. the difference between the sound of a piano (which attacks and decays very quickly) and an organ (which continues to make a noise until you release the key.)

[Here’s a video from Tomorrow’s World on the Moog synthesiser, which was the first commercially-available ‘modern’ analogue synthesiser.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usl_TvIFtG0) Note particularly where the narrator says that, in the past, to create these sorts of noises would’ve taken radiophonic experts days—that’s because the recordings literally had to be passed through multiple units every single time. This is testament to both the ingenuity and patience of those working in the Radiophonic Workshop in the 60s, and to the explosion in electronic music that Moog’s synthesiser enabled—it really made it much more accessible.

Lastly, [I wish I had access to this in my undergrad](http://calnewport.com/blog/about/) - consistently the best advice on studying I've ever come across when you take the lessons to heart. Do work in he library. Think your lectures are unfulfilling? Go to other peoples lectures and learn something. 

Do these things and you will learn a lot. Don't get hung up on grades - they are a consequence of doing something well and understanding the material, so don't compare yourself to your course mates - start reading the material from the people you admire. When you hear someone ask how to get a good grade they are asking he wrong question. 

As for your living situation - if it's tolerable make the most of it: some of your room mates may be friends for life; don't squander the opportunity. If it's not tolerable, move accommodation and get asked to be put in with post grads. They're quiet and usually foreign, which means excellent food if you get chummy with them.

Not all cultures go forward, you know. Beirut and Baghdad in the 1100s were the global centre of art, culture, science, philosophy.. now look at them. There is nothing written in the starts that things always magically get better. And if you import hundreds of thousands of people who may not share your values, then you're only speeding that process up.

That report doesn't take into account the overcrowding of the NHS. We even have senior NHS officials saying we can't handle more patients. It also doesn't consider the amount of school places. Even those high up in education reform concede that we somehow need to magically summon 250,000 new primary school places. And it also doesn't cover the fact that we need to build more houses. The government are currently entertaining the idea of concreting over the countryside in order to build more houses.

I'm sorry but out net migration figure of 210,000 a YEAR has a lot to do with that.

And this is before we even START considering the fact that these immigrants will one day get old and need pensions and healthcare and the like. 

Besides, their approach misses the point. They claim that ""immigrants outside the EEA contribute 34% in taxes"". Even if I concede that, it doesn't change anything. Would you be in favor of letting in 40 million new people, tomorrow, if they all paid 34% more in taxes than native Brits?

Tax contributions aren't everything. We also have to take into the account the fact that we are a FINITE Island with not much physical space, and in some cities, we already have an extremely high population density.

I don't share your faith that we can simply carry on importing HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of people every year and somehow everything turn out fine. There comes a point where we have to say enough is enough.

There is also the issue of wage compression, and unemployment. We have seen wages go down by 14% in real terms, when factoring in inflation. [Migration watch do not concede that point, they actually say that impact on GDP is ""essentially negligible"". They then go on to say that there is a correlation between immigration and British unemployment.](http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/briefingPaper/document/235)

Um advice wise I would say that expect a relatively slow start to the year - semester one is quite nicely paced, so don't worry too much. Your main module (Chem10101) will build on things from A level and really won't be too difficult at all as long as you attend the lectures or at least catch up if you can't make it (amazing how this confuses so many people...) - you will have a nicer start than the life science students, for example, as they have waaay more exams in January and their year accounts for 10% of their grade! So feel lucky. Plus you're doing Chemistry so you're just luckier, smarter and more good looking than them anyway.*

Second semester things step up a bit course-wise but again, it isn't that bad as long as you keep up. A big time consuming thing will be lab reports for both semesters- first year labs are usually every Monday and you have a week to produce a report. They take a bit of getting used to but labs are worth 20 credits so take the time over them to get a good mark. Synthesis labs are MUCH better than measurements labs though, and the reports are easier!

There are PASS sessions which can be a bit hit and miss - ultimately they are good for meeting people and adjusting in your first few weeks though, so don't dismiss them outright because they seem useless, go at least a few times (I'm a PASS leader next year, I may see you there...).

Oh and there's a shitty module called Transferable Skills for Chemists. Yes it's rubbish and not worth the measly 10 credits but it can push your average up so don't get too lazy with it.

Hmm otherwise enjoy first year! Everyone else tells me second year is bloody difficult and a real step up so knowing your stuff from first year and having the social connections you've made will help in the future.

As for Fresher's week and settling in... don't worry if you don't like it all at the start. I found Fresher's to be a bit crap because no one really knows each other -I look forward to Fresher's next year though! Where are you thinking of living?

But not even remotely the same kind of injustices.

&gt;Bradford city stadium fire, the flammable materials in the stand shouldn't have been used. Someone fucked up. People died.

Yes it was terrible. Everyone accepted that the stadium was unsuitable but that it was a terribly unfortunate accident.

Were the Bradford fans accused of being drunk and causing the accident? Were the Bradford fans accused of urinating and stealing from the dead? Did the police outright lie about what happened?

It's just not the same at all.

&gt;It's horrible and efforts should be made so it never happens again but Christ almighty doesn't liverpool ham it up. 

In what way do they 'ham it up'? Is a minute's silence every anniversary that much to ask for?

&gt;They are, but not in some weird tribal 'the world is against scousers' way.

I don't know what kind of exposure you've had, but this simply doesn't happen. The rest of the footballing world is with the Liverpool fans and they know it.

true,gonnaloseweight,eng-westmidlands,Burminghum,"Going into halls isn't necessary but for some people it is the best option. The positives of halls are that you'll at least have a group of people to hang out with for the first few weeks, which makes socialising a lot easier and can be fun. Also, catering can be incredibly useful if you are coming straight from living at home and haven't done much cooking. It isn't necessary (I certainly wouldn't choose it) but it can make the transition from home to uni a bit smoother. You might also be put with people from your course (ask your uni) which will mean you can go to classes together or work on projects together (fun!). 

The downsides are that you are stuck living with a bunch of 18 year olds who have never lived on their own before and you will have to endure the potential drama that follows. People will be messy, people will probably eat your snacks, people will be loud and obnoxious and no one will care if you're trying to study or you have a test the next day. You also run the risk of not actually liking your housemates and then you're stuck with them for a year. Also, wifi can be an issue in halls. Most people I know have had issues with their wifi, from either not having it at all, to patchy signals or not being able to access certain websites. 

Personally, I never had any urge to live in halls and I'm really glad I didn't bother with it.

Not really.

Let's take that £50m.  We'd move on Dzeko who costs £14m a year, so now it's £36m.  We'd obviously have increased visibility on our own from having Messi at City.  Let's conservatively call that an extra £6m a year from new deals including the revaluation of our kit deal which is much too low if we had Messi who is an international shirt seller (kit deals are gone off shirts sold rather than visibility like shirt sponsors).

This leaves us £30m.  Add in the £10m in image right payments and this puts us at £20m.

Now the question becomes does Lionel Messi add £20m of footballing value to City in increased attendances, helping us to go further in the CL or helping us win the PL?

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;The problem many councils have had over the past 20 years is that they have sold off council homes in right to buy, yet didn't invest in more properties with that cash.

It's even worse than that.  It's been many years since I looked at it but something like 80% of the proceeds of a Right to Buy sale had to be reinvested in new housing.  The problem is that the proceeds were hugely subsidised and the new houses were within Right to Buy.  So, they'd sell off more than one house to get enough money to build one new one and then they had to sell that off for a discount price.

I believe this is the reason councils dumped the dregs of their housing stocks into Housing Associations, since it was the only way to break the cycle.

This was all entirely deliberate though.  The Conservatives were explicitly clear at the time that the point was to make people middle-class home-owners.  The other part is that they didn't believe that it was the job of government to provide things like housing.",0,1399384734,null,0,false,0,chaxbeu,t3_24ut67,t1_chaxbeu,t1_chawl5y,null,1433674466,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

But let's say they've got 3 kids in private school (£100k a year), a big mortgage on a four million pound house (£300k a year let's say), regular holidays to go on (£40k a year), a cleaner and gardener, to pay (£40k a year), a wife to 'keep' (let's say £50k if we're being cheap), expensive elderly care for old parents (£40-60k a year), a holiday home to maintain etc... it all adds up. 

I'm not saying that these people deserve to be pitied or anything, just that I know a few of these people with more than enough money who feel trapped and poor because they are just accustomed to a certain standard of living.  Can you imagine if Bob the banker came home and told his wife she's not getting any more spending money, the kids he's taking them out of school, the cleaner/gardener they're fired, and announced that he's selling the home so the family can go live in Appalachia and live a simple life?  Even if the guy wants it, he probably doesn't want to ruin his family or get divorced.   Getting out of a rut like that is really hard.  Might as well keep grinding the rat race, and hope retirement is alright.

Beirut and Baghdad in the 1100s were the global centre of art, culture, science, philosophy.. now look at them. There is nothing written in the starts that things always magically get better. And if you import hundreds of thousands of people who may not share your values, then you're only speeding that process up.

If you seriously think our democracy will crumble because of immigration in the near decades then you're wrong. Historically, democracies crumble for various reasons, but immigration has never been one as far as I know.

As for the validity of this report. Page 14 states that the average immigrant uses the NHS with the same frequency as the average Briton. In fact, [the growth rate of the population of the UK is falling](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.GROW). You'd be right in saying that the population is increasing due to immigration more than natural increase. I believe immigration is about 1.2x more than natural increase. In fact, with 0 immigrants, our population would begin to fall. However, we need immigration in order to keep our population from ageing significantly. 

If you want to talk about strain on the NHS, you want to be worried about an [aging population](http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-for-the-new-parliament/value-for-money-in-public-services/the-ageing-population/). 10 million in the UK are over 65, and that number will double within the next 35 years. By 2050, one in four people will be aged over 65. 65% of the Department for Work and Pensions benefit expenditure goes towards the elderly today, which is a seventh of the public expenditure. The average retired household uses nearly twice as much money as non-retired households on the NHS. 

We need immigration precisely *because* we live in such an excellent first world nation. Our NHS is too good at keeping people alive, and as a consequence, we need to find a replacement working population to support the quarter of the population which will be unable to work, and ""mooching"" off of our benefits system come 2050. 

&gt;And this is before we even START considering the fact that these immigrants will one day get old and need pensions and healthcare and the like.

Well, taxes pay for pensions, healthcare, education and the like. If the average immigrant contributes more tax than the average Briton, then the problem fixes itself. We'll even have a bit left over to spend on those fancy catapult aircraft carriers, or improve the quality of care in hospitals. I could go on.

&gt;Would you be in favor of letting in 40 million new people, tomorrow, if they all paid 34% more in taxes than native Brits?

Christ you aren't quoting the population of Bulgaria/Romania are you? Do you seriously believe that everybody is going to pack up and leave to come to the UK? Is that seriously what you're saying? No, our population will not increase by fifty percent by tomorrow morning, that is a ludicrous strawman :P

&gt;Tax contributions aren't everything. We also have to take into the account the fact that we are a FINITE Island with not much physical space, and in some cities, we already have an extremely high population density. 

A more rational worry here. There are reports that we're the most densely populated country in Europe. The obvious downsides of population density are pollution happening in a dense area, causing, in extreme cases, smog seen in China, as well as deforestation and other environmental concerns. However, on the upside, more money should flow to the UK, as we'll need more resources to accommodate for the higher population. A higher rate of flow of money is great for the economy.

&gt;I don't share your faith that we can simply carry on importing HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of people every year and somehow everything turn out fine. 

Quite the contrary. In the long term, we can't afford not to. See the above ageing population problem.

&gt; Migration watch do not concede that point

Strange. Their founder seemed to say otherwise on the [Radio 4 Today Programme](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24813467). It's unclear whether or not that report factors in EU immigration or not.

True after a fashion but huge numbers of those claims are unsuccessful.

A lot of them would probably never be pursued if the red top papers didn't run story after story about how some random toerag wanted compensation from someone or other after suffering injury from their own stupidity.  No one ever reports on the failed claims, so it leaves the impression that there are huge payouts to be had.

Sometimes there are, but usually there is strong evidence of neglect on the part of the person being sued for damaged to justify it.

true,gonnaloseweight,eng-westmidlands,Burminghum,"I'm just finishing up my first year on an arts course at an ex poly and I initially had the same complaints. Granted I don't live in halls but with regards to your course, the thing to remember is that you will get out of it what you put in. I hear so many people on my course with the same complaints as you - they're not learning anything, they're not teaching you anything you couldn't learn elsewhere, they barely have any lectures - but they never do anything about it. 

The best thing you can do at this point is to email your tutors and explain that you don't feel like you're getting the best out of your course and what can you do to change that? Can they give you some extra assignments or mini projects? Suggest more books to read? etc. I did the same thing after the first few months of my course and it has improved things ten fold for me. My tutors have set me extra projects, set me tasks, done individual crits. with me and yes, it's shit that my £9,000 a year doesn't make this standard fare but if you put in the effort, most tutors are happy to help out motivated students. It also means that when you graduate you'll have an awesome reference from a tutor who actually knows you and will fight harder to get you a job. They also might be able to help you with some contacts, if they know you'll be a good employee.. 

Another thing to consider is whether or not you're making the most of your uni's facilities. Don't forget that your £9,000 a year pays for computer labs, well stocked libraries, knowledgable technicians etc. and that you should be making the most of those aspects of your education too. Half the people on my course don't even use the library and then complain that they're not learning anything. Use everything at your disposal as much as physically possible - you probably won't get access to these sorts of facilities ever again! 

Also, start looking for internships and work experience now. Do not wait until 2nd year/3rd year, do it ASAP. Not only will it look awesome on your CV but it will give you more experience than the people who wait until their final year and it'll suck up some of the free time that probably makes you feel like you're not doing anything.

People getting all offended by some of the claims made on here should go visit some pubs around Anfield and listen to some of the conversations after the game by people who actually went to it - the stuff they'd hear there would be way worse than anything I've seen on here. Totally don't understand this bizarre mentality of ""real fans don't bitch about players"" that seems to have grown on here recently. Real fans don't go and actively abuse players on Twitter, but bitching and criticising to other fans about things is totally acceptable.

You must not be talking to the same people I've spoken to, or live in the same area. When I was jobseeking two years ago, there were jobs. Unfortunely, 70% of them were welding jobs - for which I had no training nor any means of gaining such training. 15% were 2-hour a week cleaning jobs at various rural and semi-rural locations around the county, where the cost of travelling there, and maintaining my car to enable continues travel, would have seen me just about break even. The other 15%, I applied for. But none of the shops and cafes wanted someone with two degrees who was over 21 and thus required a higher wage than a 17 year old, and the receptionist jobs wanted someone with experience.

So yeah, there are jobs. There are jobs I'm not qualified for, jobs that will leave me worse off than before, jobs I don't have enough experience for, and jobs that won't accept someone educated or over 21 (seriously, I know for a fact one of them decided not to hire me, after a trial shift, because of my age.

true,Cast_Me-Aside,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;I thought I had it bad when I only found on on the Sat what shifts I would be working the Monday onwards, I think I would have had a neverous breakdown if I had to call up daily to see if I was needed.

It's not even a new thing.  Zero-hours contracts have taken off in a big way in the last few years, but they're not new and neither is using agency staff to achieve the same thing.

Around fifteen years ago I had a temp job at a bank working overnight on cheques.  The full shift was somethign like 10PM to 6AM.  Maybe Midnight to 8AM.  I forget exactly.

This was a soul destroying job.  Cheques were hand sorted and then scanned.  The scanned images would pop up on a screen and I typed in the number.  Because I was looking at the same small patch of the screen and constantly typing numbers in the early hours of the morning my eyes used to dry out and stick open.

After a fairly short time you settle into the flow of a job like this and can do each cheque surprisingly fast.  This is what led to the stickied open eyes, since the cheques went so fast I sort of forgot to blink enough.

The reward for getting done early was to be sent home early.  but apart from the supervisor we were all agency staff being paid for the actual time worked.  The last morning I went we were put out at 3AM.  My journey to and from that job was about ninety minutes each way and that night it had cost me more to travel than I earned.

I called the agency as soon as they opened and told them I wouldn't be going back.  The woman from the agency was furious and demanded I work the agreed week's notice.  She didn't consider the fact that I wasn't getting the hours we agreed to be a relevent feature at all.

During the financial crisis, the bank I work for wanted to trim down its senior executives, so it had a voluntary retirement scheme not unlike most other companies.   Unlike the lower level people these guys were on good contracts and thus had some negotiation leverage (especially as the bank wanted them to agree to not work for the competition for 'x' years).   A lot of them took their £2m or £3m and went to Bermuda/Florida/Spain, bought a nice house and are living off the rest of their days.  We still get postcards from them occasionally.  They were generally the people with families, who worked to live more than the other way round.   

Others, however, felt differently.  My MD/boss is a great guy- friendly, smart, really worked his way up from a poor family in Greece to now being a senior guy making lots of money.  He got promoted back in 2008, when the bank's shares were in the shitter, and got given a lot of stock to be offloaded in 5 or 6 years.   Now that the market has partially recovered, he's sitting on millions, in addition to the money he made working trading.

He's the first in in the morning and the last out at night, and he works really hard so I don't begrudge him or anything, but he just loves money, and he loves being the big shot banker guy who has all the nice stuff.  

At the end of the day money does different things to different people.  I'm in the middle really (and I'm not very wealthy anyway, fwiw) , though much like you I still find myself refusing to pay for taxis or overpriced lunches. :)

With deBoer your getting a lot of skill and CL experience (that would hopefully translate to managing Spurs but you never know) and you're getting a higher profile that would prove beneficial when it comes to attracting higher profile players.

It really is a shame, because the system as designed would have fixed a good deal of the issues many on welfare face, the main one being that if they get 3 weeks work (which is good, because it might lead to more work, and possibly a full time job) currently their welfare claims can be screwed for months following this.",0,1399387790,null,0,false,0,chayhtp,t3_24ut67,t1_chayhtp,t1_chavag2,null,1433675022,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Automation isn't at all at odds with non-capitalist socio-economic theory. When almost all labour is automated, perhaps all people of working age will work for only a day or even a few hours a week each. The jist of what Lenin was saying is that it is unfair for people to benefit from the collective products of society if they are not involved in that production. That's something which holds true, but it does *not* necessarily entail a 40-hour work week.

Basic income isn't something other than capitalism or communism. It is capitalism's last gasp - it still allows for vast inequality, it still allows for some to profit massively and have assets at their disposal which perpetuate their wealth. Having lived on the dole (and BI by its very nature as 'basic' can hardly be expected to pay much more), it is pittance and leaves no room for anything like a healthy and enriching life. People may not be wage slaves in the way we are now, but they will still clamour over an ever-decreasing pool of work. The fundamental difference in a society with BI will be that those without work won't be coerced to go to the Jobcentre. If profit is still a factor, and under BI it is, any sensible company would rather have one, full-time trained employee who is thankful for their scarce job than employ five people for a day a week, all trained, having to supplement their income by a substantial-enough amount to make their effort worthwhile. The second option is not as profitable as the first, it simply isn't.

true,NibblyPig,english,Bristol,"It sounds bad until you consider the process of eviction at the moment.

A tenant on benefits stops paying their rent. After they've built up arrears, an eviction notice can be filed for non-payment, which gives them 1 month notice. At that point, they can pay the outstanding debt (bear in mind, they'll still be 1 month in arrears) which cancels the notice.

They cannot keep housing benefit if they leave of their own accord so landlords cannot negotiate some terms - people will deliberately refuse to leave until forced out.

The second route requires 2 months notice by filing a more general eviction notice. After 2 months they still don't have to leave, and the landlord has to apply to the courts. During this entire time, it's likely there is no money coming in to the landlord. They have to wait another month or more to apply to the court. At this point the court may decide that since they'd be homeless if evicted, they have to stay. So it was all for nothing.

Alternatively if they're lucky, the tenant could be forced out. Next the landlord has to apply to get the bailiffs in to actually drag them out.

This whole process can take 4-6 months in total, costing the landlord a few thousand quid, not to mention the tenants may completely destroy the place ripping up anything and everything they can find because there is no penalty for them doing this, costing the landlord potentially thousands more.

Given the choice, if I were a landlord, I wouldn't rent to DSS and I would absolutely want a better eviction process in place.",0,1399389060,null,0,false,0,chaz11i,t3_24ut67,t1_chaz11i,t1_chayvup,null,1433675274,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

Problem here is effective monopolies have been established, the threat of substitution is also non-existent, becuase I can't choose whether or not take first great western say, if I want to get to london in around 3 hours. This allows whoever runs a part of the line like a private fiefdom. The issue or privatization is largely irrelevant, because as it was constructed, and in part due to how they related to network rail. There is rarely if ever, any space for actual competition. 

With the energy companies, here people have to be really careful, if they want to not just talk empty rhetoric. Are prices high, yeap. But is there competition, actually yes. Quite a lot of it is driven by subsidiaries of the later companies to undercut each other. Yet companies like utility wharehouse do exist and are pretty competitive. The real issue there is that as an industry as people talk about it, they are allmost soley talking about the customer facing supply side. Not any of the infrastructure behind it. Which is actually one of the few success stories of intervention to stop naturally monopolies as despite wales for example being almost all supplied by SSE in terms of electricity, they can't leverage that to completely control the market. Likewise BG controls a huge portion of the actual gas supply, yet has its prices significantly raise to allow others to compete with it there.

So no, there is competition. Lot's actually. It's just that they are struggling to seriously out leverage each other, party because energy prices globally are on a steady upwards march. 

The real issue though is that when they say 'we need to charge lots to re-invest' that's only partly bullshit. Our infastructure is not in a good way and needs Billions of pounds of expansion. So people being pissed about prices of a basic commdity going steadily up not down, in part because moniez, in part for actual reasons. Is being conflated by some political players and narratives into 'privitisation doesn't work'. Actually no, it doesn't prove that at all. Nationalise energy wholesale from supply to point of delivery, prices will barely move. 

Where as with mail serice. Damn son, competition out of the ass, part of the reason royal mail is where it is, is because the purpose of a primary mail carrier is less and less relevant with email. In package delivery, you have firm like DPD running laps around it for years. Again though, this is largely because technology has changed to make natural monopolies less relevant.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I would argue quite the opposite.  Basic Income is merely the next in a long line of evolutions that capitalism has taken to adapt to new economic paradigms. 

Also, you utterly fail to account for the numerous positive effects of automation.   If there are no longer taxi drivers, the cost of hiring a taxi falls dramatically.  If shipping is automated, the cost of transporting goods fall dramatically.  If medicine/healthcare/surgery is automated, the cost of healthcare falls dramatically.  If manufacturing is fully automated, and work can be done by machines 24 hours a day instead of just 8 hours a day by humans, production and thus the supply of goods goes up massively, further lowering prices. 

Indeed in a fully automated supply chain there are only two major costs- raw materials and energy.   The cost of most widgets (consumer goods) is already falling, especially in heavily automated environments (like technology).   A new tablet that cost $500 three years ago can be had for $50 today, in production cost.    Food too, continues to fall in price on a global level, especially as transport becomes more efficient and less is wasted.   Building materials as well, and even whole houses, will fall hugely in price with 3D printing. 

So actually in the future it is quite possible (I would argue likely) that you will be able to lead a great and fulfilling life on a relatively small basic income.  I see from your posting history that you are a socialist so this argument is probably futile but civilization tends toward utopia.  In my opinion violent revolution that risks the collapse of the democratic system and the institutions that protect it is not worth it when a basic income could solve our problems, end poverty, and ease us into a post scarcity economy without major societal upheaval.

Why do you think this? I'm not necessarily saying we don't have a shot at the title next year, but I'm not so sure there's a ton of room to improve in the areas that matter. Our offense, for instance, will likely get worse, as this has been an extraordinary season for goalscoring and our two forwards. We also have had individual players playing above what was expected.

I don't even disagree with your points, you've just made a very poor effort at trying to support them. ""Rodgers has a plan and we should believe him when he says it"" is fine, but it isn't really reliable reasoning for why we should think a certain way.

I think what we should've learned from this year is that it takes an incredible amount of luck to win a title, or it takes weaker contenders. This year we performed extremely well, but we also had a bit of both luck and mistakes from other contenders. Perhaps we'll be able to overcome the loss of this luck via squad performance, but it isn't a given at all that our key players will elevate their game even further or even stay at the same level in the case of Suarez and Sturridge who both had banner years.",0,1399389889,null,0,false,0,chazedp,t3_24unj8,t1_chazedp,t3_24unj8,null,1433675448,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Unfortunately also, the issue on the side of this as well. As noted, a lot of the issues really do come down to the fact we need massive reinvestment in infrastructure. The rail network is in many places fucked. New high speed lines like HS2 are not actually... that shit an idea and have been politicized far too much. It is an appropriate place for government at this point to do several loss leading interventions in the market to make it less rickety and shit. I think power with nuclear, tidal and wind should also be on the table there. 

End of the day, the goverment could not instantly do better in any of these fields - indeed the real issue of its ability to respond to the price mechanism comes into play quickly. Not to mention the state now having to bare massive costs if it actually wanted to drive prices down to any significant level on any of these fronts. 

The issue then becomes without private investment coming in, we state than has to bare even more costs in unfucking the infastructure.

I'm not defending the status que, LOTS needs doing. And some sort of hybrid solution is a must. Goverment Bond yields are going to have to go up, but we are going to have to get private investment in spades as well.

I was at a friends house for a Birthday party, which was about a 30 minute walk away from my own house.  Obviously I had a few drinks at the party, and it was around 3:00am when I decided to start walking home.  I had an umbrella with me since it was pretty windy and rainy outside, but the rain was off by the time I was going home.  

Anyway, it's still pretty windy out and I'm walking up the road, nearing my own house, and I come to a fence which I start clicking my umbrella off as I walk past it.  As I'm nearing my own street I notice a Police Landrover sitting across the road.  I get to the top of my street and the Landrover takes off, turns 180 degrees back down towards me and stops.  Three Police Officers bounce out and grab me, asking where I've been, what I've been at, have I been drinking etc. the usual shite.  All the while searching me for evidence.

Standing around for at least half an hour, and still haven't been told what I've been stopped for at all when another meat wagon pulls up with, who I presumed to be, King Dick of the patrols that night.  Nods between them are had, and I'm arrested for Attempted Burglary and Criminal Damage.  At this point I'm forced into the Landrover, arms and hands twisted while I'm already handcuffed, and then Constable ""Big Lawd"" hops in and chokes me against the roof and drivers seat.  I'm taken to Lisburn Police Station.

The next day I'm questioned and released without charges.  Ends up that they investigated the crime scene and found out that the wind had blown a length of drain pipe off the side of the house, and the owners had shit their monks and rang the cops, thinking someone was trying to break in, and while they were on the phone they had heard me clicking my umbrella off their fence, so they gave my description to the police as the intruder.  Also the bastards took my new shoes, jumper and hat as ""evidence"" and I never seen them again, about £120 down the drain.

Not necessarily; as long as any employer could show it had made ""every reasonable effort"" to find a suitably-qualified EU candidate, but had failed, the employer could apply for a Tier 2 visa for a non-EU applicant.

Unfortunately the Home Office's definition of ""making every reasonable effort"" is hard to quantify. For a job such as PE teacher then simply advertising in the usual places (TES, Guardian Education) might be sufficient, it's unlikely they'd require the school to place adverts in every major educational publication across the entire EU.

However sponsoring a Tier 2 visa for an applicant is a complicated and expensive process, and it's unlikely many schools, especially state schools, would be prepared to do so for a bog-standard just-graduated PGCE student, unfortunately.

Edit: one other point -- a PGCE qualifies you as a teacher, full stop. There's no specific qualification as a ""physics teacher"" or ""maths teacher"", and no legal requirement for teachers to teach the subject in which their main degree is held. So in theory OP could do a PGCE and then apply for any teaching job, not just PE, but again unless he's going to be chasing the hard-to-fill jobs (failing inner-city schools and so on) it's not going to be at all easy.",0,1399391005,null,0,false,0,chazwl7,t3_24uw5u,t1_chazwl7,t1_chay12k,null,1433675687,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

true,peon2,null,null,"I'm not entirely sure how they want it to work with football but as an American I can explain how our baseball system works. A franchise such as the Redsox consists of the major league Red sox, the AAA (triple A) division Pawtucket Red Sox and the AA (double A) Portland Sea Dogs, and then even lower tier divisions that no one really pays attention to. The AA and AAA divisions are usually referred to as ""farm teams"" where players are grown and given experience. During the regular season of the major leagues the Red Sox must have a 25 man roster. If a player is under performing or injured they are usually sent down to the lower league and a player that is playing amazing in the lower league is brought up in his place. This can be done at any time during the season as long as you maintain only 25 players on the roster. So there is not really a transfer window. Some players are called up, show that they can shine and stick around. Others will come up, play a game or two, be sent back and never return, and other players will routinely make brief appearances throughout the whole season if they can play many different positions as they are good at replacing any injured player.
In baseball it is very common to see a AAA player come up and have a few games during the regular season,and I wonder how often it will be used in football if this is imlpemented.  Look at our CB situation, we have Terry, Cahill, and Luiz playing the starting roles and our next bet would probably be Nathan Ake. He is on the reserves most of the time so he doesn't really play much at all, but when he is on the reserves as opposed to the bench there is not chance of him being called up. It would be nice to see him playing in a lower division as to not get rusty without having to loan him out to another team so that we can bring him back at anytime. Imagine if Lukaku was sent to a B team instead of Everton. Once we saw that the striker situation was a little messy we could have pulled him back immediately and sent another player down in his place.",0,1399391168,null,0,false,0,chazz7e,t3_24utj7,t1_chazz7e,t1_chayy37,null,1433675721,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

But, by the time it was privatised, 60% of BT exchanges were already digital, and the remainder were converted out of revenue. Not a penny of the sell-off went to BT.

It's based on the notion that brussels are Tyrannical overlords who impose European values on everyone else.

One example is the [Block exemption law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Exemption_Regulation_(EU)), which allows countries to deviate from EU regulation in specific industries or sectors if it is neccesary for financial or social reasons.


Another example is Article 46 is of the Maastricht treaty (I think) which allows memberstates to forgo most of the formalities and quickly re-negotiate treaties in the case of international humanitarian disaster or looming financial crisis.

If you want to see this subreddit grow, the subreddit needs to be advertised more, be that /r/soccer or whatever, it needs more appeal, it also needs these weekly events that I have listed.

But the one biggest thing this subreddit needs is more mods, more mods who will do these things ive listed and make an attempt to make this subreddit grow, /r/Marzepans is an active user and probably the most active mod and does post on this subreddit every now and again, but is usually posting on /r/soccer, so the mods are there, just not doing anything.

Primary is an option, but makes staying and getting a tier 2 visa more difficult.

Then we had a three goal lead against the worst offense in the league with 11 minutes to go, and totally collapsed. There is no way to put a positive spin on this.

I want a bit of a bully, I dont care if they are playing in the CB or CDM role but someone from the mould of Carragher or Bellamy, not afraid to speak up and not allow themselves to get sucked into the flow of the game.
 
As the pundits for Sky Sports all said after the game, all of the players allowed themselves to be sucked into the game, and when we started pushing even harder, we needed someone who was going to turn round and tell people what their jobs are and what they should be doing, without question. 

And,I dont think we have that real vocal player any more, People will disagree, because we sometimes see the likes of Mignolet shouting now and then, but I think actually, he is one of the causes for our poor set pieces this season, as he just does not appear to have full command of his own box. Maybe thats just me, but everytime I see a player, no matter who they are take a shot outside the box, I know most of the time we are in safe hands with Mignolet, come to a set piece though, and I dont want to look. 


Sakho annoys me aswell, Good player no doubt, but for me in the last three or four games probably leading back to the challenge on a city player I think it was, I have noticed he has these musket type feet  where he will occasionally wildly stab at people, luckily he has never really been made to pay for it, but I just do not see a fully competent defender when I look at him *yet*.

I am not saying any of that would have changed the game, or was our problem but to me, I really miss that bull dog like player who runs around screaming at people to do their jobs, someone who can stop their selves getting caught up in the flow of the game sometimes, 

So I think, yes we do need to buy quality, but Hopefully a good player who can also be in charge of the defence. Or, Alternatively invest the money in age regression therapy and bring back Carragher, and Hyppia, and all the greats in fact.

Think about it, the guy is probably a Spurs fan and having a job at the club is probably the stuff of dreams for him, he wouldn't be stupid enough to do something like this on purpose and jeopardize his job.

Spurs are not going to state exactly how the mistake was made, just put out something about their account being hacked (which they didn't really need to say), they know people are not going to buy it, but as far as they are concerned it's dealt with publicly. The guy will get a bit of a telling off and told to make absolutely sure that he's logged into his own account before posting. I double check every time I post that I'm not logged into any of the other accounts I have control of and I can see how easily someone could mix it up.

It was an accident, and in the grand scheme of things it's not really costly. Do you honestly think Spurs are going to lose anything from this? Are they going to lose money? Are sponsors going to pull out? Are people going to refuse to do business with them? Are players going to refuse to sign for them? No to all. If a member of staff from our club rang Spurs this morning they would have got the explanation as to how it happened, an apology and that's it.

All that's happened here is that it's offended some Liverpool supporters who'll now think Spurs are a little less 'classier' than before.

Maybe some people want to subscribe to idea that a rival club care so much about us that they must release an official statement, but I don't, I find it hard to believe that a club finishing a couple of places below would feel the need to post something like this officially, the supporters can, they can do what they want, it doesn't bother me, but the club? naah.

BT weren't forced to improve installation times by the inexorable forces of competition. They improved because they could.

And, BT retained the final word on what could be connected to their lines, for many years after privatisation.

The problem wasn't the ownership of the corporation, it was the belief that telephony required control of the whole route (probably valid at the time of the GPO). That mistake was repeated with privatisation, with BT sold off *as a single company*.

I guess no ones doing the normally lazy as fuck 'source plz' crap, because its so uncontencious.

And heres the thing. Look at te German and French systems, its far more of a successful hybrid than our own. Why? Sure state controls and massively subsidies insurance essentially, but it looks like that is LEEPS AND BOUNDs better at responding to actual demand than our own system of primary healthcare trusts.

But what you've committed to is, saying no that as, it is basically opens up the door to private entities and profit to get involved. Seems like your just getting it wrong somewhere. 

So **tl;dr** acess to these basic all purpose goods is super important for welfare ,and needs to at least fall under the perview of a state in regards to 'if not well provision we are doing a shitty job'. But this NO PRIVITISATION EVARRRR PRIVISATION AND PRIVATE ENTITIES EVIL. Just seems like empty ideological rhetoric, I can't and won't get on board with.

&gt;perhaps you can quell my conspiracy theorist mind that thinks alot of what we see in science fiction is pre-emptive excuse making for human mistakes or actions. ie blame the robot not the programmer.

Hmm.Well a lot of sci-fi is simply 'look space stuff what makes my story exciting'. Lot is not. Azminov and Clark never really missed a beat and the guy could science. Though they are off a few times on this, but we didn't really have a good grasp of the limits of computing back then I suppose. So they can be forgiven.

Thing is, its hard to say at this point in time, exactly what extent you can frame intelligence. I can say with reasonable certainty its doable. But what form it will take is most likely like biological evolution as much going to be a string of accidents and breakthroughs as opposed to a giant 'plan for inteligence' that when it crosses the finally t's and dots i's. Something thats human but machine, will open its eyes and done. 

Hell another bit of intelligence is emotional intelligence and empathy. Again seems to relate to evolving as a social animal and so the ability to see other members of your familiar group as 'like you' in virtue of having similar emotional states about things in the world and each other, appears to aid not murdering each other for no good reason and alturism in general.

So yeah, I think you could have the two above things, maybe... maybe without that.

This would likely be a bad idea. In some respects. But its hard to say. Again, a machine that can to some extent have a complex meta-state like hate. Hmm.. good idea?

Likewise maybe the whole 3/4 laws of robotics stuff is actually doable to some degree. However, you know that going wrong is a good plausible basis for a lot Clark's stories. 

In short, I think its a big issue that needs a lot more work and thought. Creating a slave race that doesn't necessarily need rest and is far more durable than us, is going to cause serve problems at some point. That as it stands and likely due to accident is quite possible. ",0,1399394772,null,0,false,0,chb1nc4,t3_24ugyv,t1_chb1nc4,t1_chb11hf,null,1433676574,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Also, the spending isn't even comparable. Liverpool's net revenue between 2004 and 2014 is about -£250million, City's is about -£630million.

Go by their rules and everything is fine and they'll get you to the destination.

Print your boarding pass before you arrive, keep your bags within their size limits, arrive on time, don't expect free food and drinks. It's just being sensible. People have a go at Ryanair because they charge you for your bag being overweight. Well first of all that's your fault for not following their rules and secondly all airlines charge for overweight bags. Prices and tolerances may differ but in general this is standard procedure.

Things like ""if your flight is cancelled they won't care"" are misleading. Ryanair is bound by EU 261 regulations just like every other airline in Europe.

You're getting a low cost fare. So don't expect frills. If you want that, fly with BA or another legacy carrier. I personally don't like their cabins, I think the yellow and blue is a bit garish. But they're cheap and most of their flights are short, so I don't see the problem. I'd take Norwegian or Easyjet over Ryanair if I could, just because of onboard experience mostly, but there's no reason to avoid Ryanair.

Also while it is true that Ryanair often use airports further away from the cities, this is made clear. They don't say Milan, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Oslo etc. they say Milan Bergamo, Dusseldorf Weeze, Frankfurt Hahn, Oslo Rygge/Oslo Torp. If you don't research where the airport is beforehand, it isn't their fault. It's yours. If you bought a ticket from London you would check if it was Heathrow/Stansted/Gatwick/City/Luton/Southend before you travel. Same thing goes here.

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"&gt; Also, you utterly fail to account for the numerous positive effects of automation. If there are no longer taxi drivers, the cost of hiring a taxi falls dramatically. If shipping is automated, the cost of transporting goods fall dramatically. If medicine/healthcare/surgery is automated, the cost of healthcare falls dramatically. If manufacturing is fully automated, and work can be done by machines 24 hours a day instead of just 8 hours a day by humans, production and thus the supply of goods goes up massively, further lowering prices. 

The cost to the provider of a service and the price of the service to the consumer are not the same thing. Even when antitrust regulations prevent explicit agreements between competitors, the prices of the things we buy are determined in large part by the mutual consent of manufacturers/those that stand to profit from their sale. Every product, before its introduction, is priced based not just on the cost of its raw materials and the labour required to produce it, but on the products with which it is intended to compete. In short, companies charge what they think they can get, not what something costs plus a reasonable percentage profit margin.

&gt;  I see from your posting history that you are a socialist so this argument is probably futile but civilization tends toward utopia.

Presumptuous, and wrong. I am neither a socialist nor do I disagree that life, on the whole, gets better. 

 &gt; a basic income could solve our problems, end poverty, and ease us into a post scarcity economy without major societal upheaval.

It certainly can't and won't. For so long as there is profit to be had, those who profit will fight tooth and nail to protect themselves, their system and their unearned wealth. Scarcity is a lot more nuanced than just factories churning out hypothetical widgets as quickly and efficiently as they can. Artificial scarcity and commodification are ubiquitous in capitalist economies, and will continue to be. If people are guaranteed a relatively comfortable life, the standard for a comfortable life will change and prices will inflate with it.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"The best system remains state control of core interests with private contractors to fill individual roles.

The sad thing is people don't even understand why national industries were so odious. Their implementation was riddled with ideology that caused a huge amount of inefficiency. Every state service had its own arm dedicated to cleaning. They wouldn't contract that out. They'd have their own management structure, own resources and own staff hired permanently for it. There is zero reason for this other than the ideological stances of the socialists who created many of the services.

None of this means that nationalised industries and services are inherently broken. It means that when you set them up you don't embed in them the plan for the eventual proletarian victory over the bourgeois. A national rail service is precisely a national rail service. Its purpose is to run trains, not tie in huge amounts of workers and infrastructure to the state so that the revolution is easier when it finally comes. There is no reason for the guy who runs the shop to be affiliated to the rail at all. He rents a space and the rail service gets a rent cheque. If the rail was ever privatised he'd pay his rent to a company instead.

The point here isn't to derail the revolution. It is that once you bundle all this extraneous nonsense onto the mechanism of the state it is impossible to shift. This leads to inefficiency.

Regardless I see no reason why a tightly contained state service can't function. If anything the rails have improved greatly since rail track was nationalised without calling it nationalised. We see a lot more long term planning now that it isn't a proper private company. Most of the improving public perception of the rails stems from this action.",0,1399398410,null,0,1399398590,0,chb3ecf,t3_24uwuz,t1_chb3ecf,t1_chay93q,null,1433677399,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

He put it this way: we traded the immediate gains we get from playing Agger (who, regardless of what you think of his individual ability, has our defence playing best statistically speaking) for the future gains of Sakho, who is more of a Rodgers type defender. Sakho's development is important because I think Rodgers definitely sees him as a central part of our defence for years to come. And he's certainly got the talent. But I think it's clear now that it was a poor time to give him his introduction. 

He didn't play worse than Skrtel yesterday, though. But for one reason or another Rodgers is averse to pairing Sakho and Agger together. Ah well. I think he's a beast in the making once he gets a pre-season with us under his belt. If you've ever watched him play for France it should be clear that we have a monster defender in our hands. Just need to stop him retreating so deep.

Voting rights? Right to the Internet? Right to reading books (from outside the prison)? Right to play a steel-stringed guitar that you purchased whilst inside prison? All of this seems petty, yet how many of those things are *necessary* to restrict in order to protect the public?

Prison isn't about repaying your crimes to society, its about removing a person from the general population who may be a danger to it. Rehabilitation should be our top priority, not catering to the sadistic desires of the public.

At the end of the day, both courses are very diverse, and will be a good starting point to look for PhD positions in Physics. You are not missing out by not going through this procedure, orient your choice of subjects and your lab work towards more mathematically inclined topics if you wish.  

That said, if you wanted a serious training in theoretical and high energy physics, the Maths course would have been better suited for you, as it teaches a wide array of theoretical physics courses, far wider than the Physics department, but obviously it does not involve any lab work at all and if you want to do lab work in your PhD you are far better off going with Physics.",0,1399399743,null,0,false,0,chb42bs,t3_24virb,t1_chb42bs,t3_24virb,null,1433677712,14,false,cambridge_uni,t5_2s17x,14

Approx. 22% are abductions by a parent (i.e. a couple separate and one parent leaves country with the children).  So it's probably around 400 per year, or a little over one a day.

That's still far too many, but it's a lot less than 100,000.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The standard for a comfortable life changes because people are never satisfied (ie it is significantly 'more comfortable' than it was 50 or even 25 years ago), but that is hardly a negative of Capitalism- rather one of its many benefits that living standards may improve so quickly. 

And as for your first paragraph, that is correct, people will charge what they can.  But Capitalists and corporations are no unified cabal- the syndicates of the 1890s existed because single individuals often owned entire companies.  In the modern day corporations are more than happy to undercut their competition, leading to further undercutting and further price drops, as is happening in everywhere from televisions to space rockets today.   Indeed it is so commonplace that when 'trusts' do arise (ie with the US cable industry) it causes a massive ruckus. 

Finally your last paragraph, with that specious comment about 'unearned wealth' strongly suggests some kind of marxist basis for your reasoning at the very least.  I try not to deal in morals or ethics, rather empirical fact.  And the fact is that very very rarely has a complete and utter social, political and economic revolution at the same point in time led to improved conditions for the vast majority of people in both the short and medium term, and often the long term as well. 

Society is an evolutionary process.  We live today in an evolution of 50s and 60s social democracy, which was itself an evolution of 1880s and 1890s Liberal Democratic Capitalism, which was itself an evolution of 1850s and 1860s Laissez Faire Capitalism, which was itself an evolution of 1810s and 1820s Protectionist Capitalism, which was itself an evolution of 18th century Mercantilism, which was itself an evolution of the 'Renaissance Economics' of the 16th century onward, and so on and so forth.  

Never has there been a successful complete break in history.  The system has always evolved, rather than fully been restarted-  those restarts almost never work out.   Even countries that do opt to sweep away their foundations and start again often find themselves, as China and Russia have, returning to where they left off.  And for good reason. 

It seems to me you have a rather pessimistic view of the future.  Food, resources, luxury goods, shelter, is in more abundance than ever before.  We are approaching an age of ever cheaper energy, and after 50 years in the shitter, even Fusion energy is going places.  3D printing will revolutionise manufacturing, millions are lifted out of poverty each year, diseases are being cured across the world... etc..   We're finally thinking about going back to space.  I don't know about you, but I often wake up and wonder what a time it is to be alive!  The most exciting age in human history so far, that's for sure. 

Frankly I couldn't care less whether there are a few rich people taking more than their 'fair share', whatever that means.   Everyone is doing better.

true,tjcefc,null,null,"I definitely know what you're getting at but I think Sturridge has been at his best this season up top with Suarez slightly left. I thought that was the most common set-up Liverpool have adopted this season. I just don't really like Rooney as the main striker, he drops too deep and tries to do too much IMO. Especially when playing for England where there is even greater expectation on him and a lot of reliance on him in general. For me Sturridge has to play up top for the good of the team as a whole. We need to pick the best TEAM, rather than trying to cater to specific individuals like Rooney. This issue is something that has plagued the England set-up for well over a decade or so (most likely longer, that is just the period of time I have been noticing it as I'm 21y.o)

 
With regards to Barkley, I just think he could be a sort of 'secret-weapon' if you like, from the bench. If we need a goal I could see him coming on and completely changing the game. Given his inexperience and inconsistency I believe coming off the bench against a tired team is when he will be most effective. That being said, I could certainly envisage  situation whereby in one of the first couple of games he comes on, plays well, and subsequently starts the next game/s because of his performance. Put it this way, I would be extremely surprised if he started the opening game, but I wouldnt be incredibly surprised if he started one of the latter games. I think Rooney should probably start in the hole but to be perfectly honest, I would not be adverse to Rooney being on the bench and starting Wilshere/Barkley in the hole (not a chance it will happen though). But that is a pretty contraversial opinion and I can understand why for many people, Rooney's name is the first on the team sheet as he is our best player. As long as Sturridge starts up front, and Lallana and Sterling start I will be pretty happy as I think a team like that could cause a lot of damage.

For example, if you get PSC later in life, you may be at higher risk of particular cancers; these figures are an average, and don't cater for these differences between people.

Here we go,

If you've got motivation problems, always mark out your work into little tasks so when you conquer each and every, pat yourself on your back mentally. Don't try and reward yourself with something physical all the time. It's bad conditioning.

Work hard, but work smarter. Always ask yourself are you spending your time wisely. Depending on your degree, some degrees require you to spread your knowledge base to do well, some require you to specialise to own in the exams. Try to balance out and hit your stride. Are you studying information too obscure and wasting your time? move on. Are you not focusing enough and not getting to the contents of your work? sharpen your focus.

Find yourself. Look at your habits and weaknesses, then decide what makes you work better or worse. Mine was snacks. I told myself I needed snacks to get through studying. I ended up snacking a lot. Studying very little. And a very fat fuck.

Stress isn't all bad. Taken from my psych housemate: She said all humans have their comforts, the thing that they reach for when they're stressed. Sometimes if you reach for it prematurely, you over relax and you lose all urges to study. I miss you Rachel.

Refresh. Don't burn yourself out. Remember to take a break when your brain saturates. However don't take breaks all the time and keep the distractions out of the room. It's easier to refresh your brain between pages if you don't have that thing keeping you distracted.

Mind maps. Great for essays. Say you have all the info you want to write a particular essay. Draw a mind map of it. Google the technique and try to emulate it. Really helps for visual learners.

Teach someone. When you know your material enough to teach someone, you're ready to get tested on it too. The discussion also helps you reinforce your own knowledge. I went to uni with a guy who could barely read, he helped us all on our homework and fucking aced our faculty.

Stay away from drugs. Quite a few of us had ""habits"". We were functional people for the most part, however off our substances we really fell apart as people. I knew a few guys who needed to 420blazeit24-7 just to stay in uni. He had to stop coming to lectures and just stay home to keep burning in his attempt to keep up. He was the no.1 student in the year, but he was beyond blessed to begin with. The drugs only slowed him down.

Envision your problems. There's 2 parts to this. One is breaking it down and visualising how you're tackling each piece. This helps you view the end of your problems or how to discover the ends of your problems. The second is when you visualise your problem you form a shape of it and it's easier to remember and take apart. Try to fully imagine your scenarios in full vivid detail, don't give up it's tough initially but it's priceless once you can do it! I'm an engineer and I imagine up a HUD with all the details in little notes all over my situations. I have a phenomenal visual memory now from constantly doing this. It's taken years but it's been worth it.

Lastly when you write essays. Ask yourself with each sentence, ""did I add value?"" ""how can I add value to my essay with my next sentence?"" if you can't don't write down what you're thinking of and move on.

I hope this helps. I wasn't the best student either in Uni but these tricks helped me level the playing field.

If you have a specific problem you'd like help with PM me. I do more than engineering these days.",0,1399401322,null,0,false,0,chb4uht,t3_24s9g9,t1_chb4uht,t1_chabf2t,null,1433678082,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"To add to what others have said, the Courts of the EU don't really act as an appeal court, but a reference court. When a matter of EU law comes before a domestic court (say the English and Welsh High Court), if the law isn't clear the domestic court can refer specific questions about the law to the CJEU, who then provide answers (after hearings etc.). The domestic court then carries on with its case. Interested parties (including national governments) are given an opportunity to have their say, but the idea is that EU law should be interpreted the same way across all Member States.

Sometimes this is great; a quick reference from the High Court can clarify a bit of law for all 28 countries. Sometimes it fails horribly, as with bits of copyright law where the CJEU has to keep saying that [x] infringes copyright while [y] doesn't, and each time a copyright case comes before a national court it seems they have to refer a new set of questions... but that's arguably bad drafting on those who wrote the relevant copyright treaties.

The CJEU does hear other cases; for example cases brought by the Commission against member states, or companies or individuals who have broken EU law on a multi-state level or cases involving the internal running of the EU government, but when you hear about the CJEU ruling on something, they are usually just answering the questions of a national court.

The ECtHR is a completely different thing - that's more like an investor-state dispute resolution thing; various governments have signed up to a treaty (the ECHR) and individuals can go to the court to complain that one or more governments have broken it.

&gt;*""In 2015, it will be the landmark 40 years since the one and only (post-legislative) referendum the UK has held on it's membership of the EEC in 1975. Anyone under the age of 58yo has never voted on it, anyone who immigrated and received citizenship vote after that date has never voted on it, which is at least &gt;50% of the population of 64 million people ie &gt;32 million people.*

The ESCC -&gt; EEC -&gt; EC -EU -&gt; ? USE ?

During the above process there has been only one referendum. Of which there has been many promises of referendums, many major Treaties signing and changing the nature of what was agreed with the people in 1975 (Common Market) was inserted into the title not ""Ever Closer Union"" as you can see from the trend above.

So this again is just highlighting that the UK people have only ever had x1 vote and at least over half of them have had x0 votes on membership nor any participation at any stage of the transformation of the EU towards a Federal political union.

I've presented x1 Fact on the EU and it is the single most important fact of the affect the EU has had on the UK and if we are given a referendum again (some for the first time) you can probably conclude that we won't have a 3rd referendum for another 40 years if ever again if going on that track-record, if people were to vote to stay IN.

It is the most important argument for or against the EU: The democratic and sovereign status of the UK either IN the EU or OUT of the EU.

If we have a referendum again this is the most important question for the UK people to decide on for the future of their country. This is the single most important fact that all voters should appreciate: It's their choice only if they have been given a vote.",1,1399401881,null,0,false,0,chb54fx,t3_24v784,t1_chb54fx,t3_24v784,null,1433678211,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

These guys all have the potential to become the next ""Varane"". Remember that very few people knew about him before RM picked him up for Ligue 2? Then all of a sudden he becomes a star. Let me tell you that wasn't by coincidence, it was by giving him the opportunity to play that he became so well known.

If RM didn't play him we would just think he is another youth prospect. I am afraid that is what will happen to some of our players if we dont give them the chance to play. CB isn't an easy spot to shine in, unlike attacking midfield and the forward position, you are judged on how few mistakes you make instead of how many goals or assists you make. Its a lot easier to look bad and a lot harder to look good in.

edit: Also, talent wise you would be surprised in how little there is between players like Zouma, Kalas and Christinsen. At this age any of them can become better then the others, it all depends on the training they receive and the confidence they get from their manager.

The guy who ran our course (no longer staff) pretty much anticipated which name we were going to say when we said there's a shit lecturer, and then facepalmed hard afterward. They know full well that he's shit with marking. We'd joke that he's pretty much the only person in the country who gives a shit about HCI and therefore the university won't fire him as they can't get a replacement.

It took us a lot of work to get just the marks out of him. We never got feedback, and all of the marks, from people who do pretty well to the layabouts who are there to prolong having to think about what to do in life, were roughly in the same range. I bet he just picked numbers at random. More irritating than the oracle server going down again anyway. 

I commuted in from Cornwall on the train and so did he, I was tempted several times to deliberately sit next to him and ask what's going on.

Yeah the placement thing was pretty good. It wasn't a huge amount of force other than ""you really really really really should do it"". If you didn't, they'd transfer you to a similarly named degree with the same modules. The only guy who didn't was one of the layabouts who probably couldn't pay an employer to take him on as his grades were so shit. He retook at least one year and ended up with a third - and this is not a hard university. I think he may even have got his grades bumped up slightly just to avoid having him come back.

Military Spending: Nobody is campaigning for increases or reductions. The Lib Dems are however against maintaining the nuclear arsenal in its current state, whereas Labour appear to support it. Labour were against intervention in Syria. 9 Lib Dems out of 56 voted against it. But I'm not sure how they'd vote if they weren't in government. Nick Clegg 'wrestled with' the idea but ended up supporting it.

Currency: Nobody is suggesting joining the Eurozone.

Royal Mail: Already privatised. Labour changed their minds all the time. Their only issue with it now is that it was undervalued when it was sold.

Banking: Labour wants banks to be split up more, dividing retail operations from investment ones. It wants bonuses taxed more. Lib Dems don't seem too keen on excessive bonuses either.

For me it wouldn't matter what players were on the field, the manager has so thoroughly infused his attack at all costs mentality into the squad, and has obviously given the players license to bomb forward even when defending a lead, that he must bear the responsibility for the result. I'm not saying the players made no mistakes, I'm saying they lack the tactical discipline to stay at home and lock it down when the job has to be done, and that's because Rodgers has implanted that philosophy into them.

I'm not.

As I said previously, I'm a season ticket holder at City. I've been attending games since '98, when we were still at Maine Road. My first season ticket was in 2000, which I held until 2004. I still went to individual games during that period. I've had my most recent season ticket for 8 years, and I'll be renewing again in the summer. I travel to most away fixtures, which have included trips to Barcelona and Moscow this season. Plus, guess what? I actually hail from the City which my football club represents!!

Get your head around that!!!

I have nothing in common, whatsoever, with a gloryhunting Liverpool fan from the US - so here I shall cease to converse with you.

Even should we reach an understanding and things get amicable, I'd never respect your opinion on the football, so it's entirely worthless continuing this discussion.

In regards to his ridiculous marking and feedback, we often joke about him having ink stamps with various percentages on them. ""50%"", ""60%"", and ""70%"" are the most common.

We have sort of worked out *how* he marks our work, too. I took a dive and tested a theory of mine during a module in my second year. During his mandatory HCI module (during which he would not shut up about Chernobyl), I would write the first report as best I could. I did lots of research for that assignment and I ended up with around 50%.

The second assignment, with the same coursework weighting (50/50) I just wrote 3000 words about utter nonsense, but littered the entire thing with works like ""cognitive"" and ""Chernobyl"".

Needless to say, the mark I received for the latter of the two was somewhat higher, reaching around 60%. Considering I did little to no research for that paper I think he marks things based on keywords, which is stupid.

In regards to the final year project, I've got my demonstration on Monday. Was it Christ Johnson or Chris Sturley you are talking about, the latter I presume. Sturley was a great guy up until recently, I've realised his marking is very harsh, especially this year. I've managed to average around 55% for all my work this year (which is great relative to my failed first year), but he gave me a 43% for an assignment I actually put a lot of effort into.

Needless, he did go on about the project for a long while prior to this year. It was easy, too.

true,DHChemist,null,null,"&gt;Why on earth does the British and Portuguese police service continue to pour such a vast amount of time and effort into finding this particular child?

Probably because it's great PR for the British Police, and damage limitation for the Portuguese. Every one of the articles written in the last 5 or so years gives the impression that the Portuguese police messed up the initial investigation, and that they'd be lost without the British Police coming in and helping them. 

Does anyone know exactly how much money is spent by the British Police on this case? To make a complete guess, perhaps there's 5 members of staff working on it full-time, with more pulled in occasionally, £1m a year spent on this case is probably generous. [As of 2010/11, the Metropolitan police alone spent nearly £7m on PR and publicity, with at least 50 members of staff.] (https://www.london.gov.uk/media/assembly-member-press-releases/green-party/2010/03/news-from-jenny-jones-police-spend-more-on-public-relations-as) Granted I don't live in London, but I can't remember any particularly positive news I've heard about the Met in recent years. Meanwhile, every time the McCann case finds some new evidence, it seems to be to be reported as a victory for the British Police. It's not costing the police a great deal of money, and returns plenty of positive publicity, so I can see why they're happy to keep funding it.

Accomodation:

* I opted to live in a hall where the oldest buiding is the oldest accommodation in the university. I think it tends to attract a quieter type of student, and I've heard some horror stories about certain other halls
* Accommodation quality isn't as good as I'd like it to be, but I don't think it's unacceptable for what I'm paying. Given I'm in catered accomodation, I wouldn't be surprised if the budget for the staff in charge is still tight. Most of the issues I have are down to people mistreating the facilities (clog the shower with your hair again and I will cut you etc.)
* My catering is pretty good. I get 2 meals every day of the week. I'm sure catering varies between universities, and without trying to sound insulting, it's really important you know what catered accommodation is actually going to get you.
* Again, my hall doesn't seem to be a hive of drunks. You get the occasional person singing at 2am, but I think the rest of my hall is mostly muttering under their breaths with me

Teaching:

* I really don't thing the £9K/hours metric makes much sense. There are  thousands of costs your not accounting for there. Things like your computing equipment, the really nice and relatively expensive IPS monitors we have in our labs. Equipment you don't get to use in your first year like clean rooms, oscilloscopes etc. The hugeish server room your CS department likely has. Research projects, which are eternally going on all over your apartment. Manchester is building a new grapheme research building at goodness knows what cost (with partial outside funding admittedly). The staff teaching you are only a miniscule amount of the research staff working around the department. Our department set up labs for Raspberry Pis then gave all the first years Pis for £15000 plus what I'm sure is many thousands more per additional lab they set up later.
Then there are costs going to the university, not the department. You have costs for miscellaneous administration departments, careers services and societies. Manchester university runs the Manchester Museum, which asides from coin boxes, is probably mostly funded by the university. Your money goes a long way.

* Yes some teachers suck. But in our case, they all seem to be new lecturers. Perhaps your top 20 uni just isn't great in this aspect, but the majority of our lecturers are highly enthusiastic about what they teach, and some of them are even truly great teachers.

* My worksheets are fine, and usually perfectly challenging. I only get one a week per subject too, not sure about you.

* I had one textbook this year, written by my programming lecturer. It's £17.50 on amazon. He waived his royalties to sell it for £10 to us

* In regards to difficulty, at least it's easy for you to get a degree. I have to work for mine =P

Clearly if someone died and left you a house worth say £400,000 then that's a fairly common occurrence and the expectation is you will deal with it promptly because there are mechanisms in place that let you do that (like paying the debt in cash, mortgaging the property to pay the debt or simply selling it and paying the debt). 

Now on the other hand, inheriting an unusual and complex set of assets like an estate with titles and lands (of which this is only a small part) will be much harder to deal with. Given that many of the estates have been in the families history for hundreds of years (400 in respect to the mountain) it doesn't seem unfair to give the guy a more lax chance to pay up. It probably took several years simply to come up with a reliable sum for what was owed - as many of those estates won't have an off-the-cuff ""value"" in the same way that a house can be rapidly valued. 

He had an option to sell property on the main estate, which would have meant evicting the current tenants and opted not to do it - so that seems pretty reasonable.",0,1399405829,null,0,false,0,chb72zb,t3_24uki8,t1_chb72zb,t1_chau1rf,null,1433679135,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,threesquares,null,null,"It's *kind* of configurable, but not really? You study a huge span of things, though and you do get choice in what you study. There is one compulsory unit each year and one optional, and you get to choose your 'pathway' - I'm doing Broad Based History for example, and my aunt is doing the Heritage Pathway so there are slightly different courses. Next autumn is introducing a BA in Classical Studies too, if you like the Ancients.  

So for instance, my first year was AA100 Arts Past and Present, which is a multi discipline compulsory module for all Humanities students, not just history. We studied Cleopatra, divas (Maria Callas, Tina Turner, some medieval choral works), the Benin Bronzes, Victorian seaside holidays, Pliny's Roman villa, the development of modern art, poetry, Plato...all sorts. It helps give you an idea of what you enjoy studying and gives you a taster of content on other courses. 

Second year has one compulsory module, A200 Exploring History: Medieval to Modern 1400-1900 and one optional module. A200 is MASSIVE and goes from the Wars of the Roses to the Reformation to the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (English Civil War etc) to slavery to the Industrial Revolution and Empire. I'm writing my last assessment for it at the moment and it's a hell of a slog but very good. My optional is A219 Exploring the Classical World, which is all Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome and I *love* it. I'm tempted to switch to a Classics pathway, but I've already missed my chance to do the 2nd year Latin module and I want to go into teaching, so I need to keep my options open. 

My third year compulsory unit is going to be A307 War, Peace, Modernity which examines modern warfare from 1918 to the end of the Cold War. My optional is *probably* going to be A330 Myths in the Greek and Roman worlds, which will take me back to Classics again, but there is also an option of doing a module in Scottish history in collaboration with the University of Dundee if I wanted. I *might* do that but I haven't made up my mind. From what I also understand, 3rd year is like most unis and gives you more space to do independent study in areas that specifically interest you.

Sorry, that turned into a bit of an essay! I hope it helps, though. It's not easy at all, but I'm really enjoying it, and you get LOADS of support from your tutors.

true,binlargin,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"I think you misunderstand. The ridiculous warning you see the first time you visit British web sites saying ""this site uses cookies, okay?"" is due to the ICO acting on  the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications, written by technically incompetent Eurocrats and [universally despised and mocked](http://nocookielaw.com/) by anyone who knows how the web works.

They demand that if you collect data on users who visit your site then you must put a link to your data collection policy and give users the ability to opt-out. However, the only way you can know if a user has opted out is by giving them a tracking cookie.

Let's say you don't use tracking cookies but instead you keep your logs and can recreate user journeys (via IP, user-agent string, referrer, etag/cache info) and hold no session at all on the server side (and therefore no session cookie). Say you just host text documents or PDF files or some other non-hypertext media and log who has visited them, then your standard logs are collecting data about people. To be compliant you must either change the way your users visit your site so you can give them the info/opt-out, or you could embed the site's tracking information into every image/video/document you serve. To disable the warning you'd also have to start keeping track of the users using a cookie, which is the whole thing that the directive was supposed to discourage.

Most people finish in 3,5 and you'll been in trouble if you go beyond 4.

Posts about other members of the [City Football Group](/r/CityFootballGroup) are currently being considered on a case-by-case basis - if we feel that the post is of relevance to this subreddit it will be allowed. This policy will likely be revisited again in the future.

In the case of this post, since it is a compilation video that covers the entire Melbourne Heart season, I think it's a helpful post for people with a new-found interest in Melbourne Heart and will help to get people up to speed ahead of what is likely to be a key period for the club.

We do have subreddits for [New York City FC](/r/NYCFC) and [Melbourne Heart](/r/MelbourneCity), as well as a subreddit for anything affecting the whole of the [City Football Group](/r/CityFootballGroup), which we encourage for most posts relating solely to the other clubs.

Technology has changed drastically in the past 10 years and most of us do not realise it.


There is one more thing which has helped reduce energy use which I can think of, which is house sizes. A majority of new houses are now smaller than their counterparts 20 years ago. So heating up a house should therefore use less energy as there is less space to heat up.

I'm assuming you went to the Chemistry applicants day - yeah, everything at Manchester is done on a much greater scale than in other institutions. There are around 40,000 students here, around three quarters of that are undergrad. This is a big place. 

Your year group is probably going to be around the size of mine - since they can offer unlimited places for students getting over ABB they will take as many fee paying students as they can, so expect ~240 students. This means 2 lab groups of over 100 students each...

The anonymity can be a really isolating experience at first. I felt like a kindergartner, unable to make any friends, but even I've ended up with flatmates for next year and a little circle now so you'll be fine.

I would say flatmates are first port of call. You're most likely to spend time with them over fresher's - even if they're not your type of people, you'll be living with them for a while so you'll want to get along. Fresher's fair is a must for all the different societies - I've made a few good friends in my subject but most from societies. There are fresher's events and club packages but wait 'til you get here before buying any - some fresher's events are totally naff and not your thing, but you can bond over that, you don't want to be stuck with pricey tickets to an event no one else wants to go to.

In terms of subject friends, they usually come from tutorial/ lab groups, it's hard to make conversation in a lecture. But ultimately everyone is in the same place as you, so be open to meeting new people and it'll happen. Try not to lock yourself away - I did that a bit, it's easy to disappear in a place so big. I would say this is why Manchester has a relatively high drop out rate if I'm being brutally honest.

Not everybody has a driving licence. Not everyone wants a driving licence. Likewise not everyone wants a passport and not everyone wants to carry their passport around. This is an issue that the ID card can address. If ID cards are compulsory you can say ""where's your ID card, we only accept ID cards"". This is harder to do without a compulsory system. Let's say you got arrested, the police would know you would have to have an ID card rather than faffing round trying to identify someone through other methods if they don't have a driving licence, for example.This was about standardisation and securitisation.

true,HedonisticVibrations,null,null,"One thing to learn about a lot fans of non league sides. They will automatically accuse of being too big for your boots and automatically assume that you feel a divine right to win the league even if this is not true. 

Dont let that annoy you, it did start pissing me off after about the 3rd season when we were still getting accused of it even though the vast majority did not hold this viewpoint. Go in knowing it is going to be hard and you will be fine. 

I'll give you some advice from a Luton fan who has been here, got the hat, tshirt and coffee mug to boot and eventually came out the other side:

- Part time teams are not what they seem. Often these players would be more than good enough to play in the league its just their 2nd job pays so well this football lark is just a nice earner on the side. I know a Dartford player for instance works in the City as a stockbroker. 

- As a result of the above you WILL lose embarrassingly at some point to one of them, prepare yourself. 

- Early season form doesn't really mean much, when the pitches start turning in winter is where the season is won and lost. 

- Do not expect to play Braintree away between the months of Dec-March, dont even bother going, it WILL be called off.

- Scouting is absolutely key. Dont just go around signing all the conference 'star' names, they will be shit for you. Most teams are built around there 1 or 2 star players, take them away from that and they fail. This happened to us numerous times (Walker, Shaw, Barnes-Homer, Willmott the list goes on)

- Do not get overly fond of players who have a good game against you. Players are so terribly inconsistent that its probably his first good game in 3 seasons. Do not sign players on the back of these performances, it will lead to abject failure!

- Get a manager who knows the league and has extensive contacts, if your current manager does not have this he will be sacked.

- The FA Trophy is a load of absolute shit. Get out of it as soon as you can. 

- Referees. You think you have seen bad League 2 referees? Well son you haven't seen anything yet trust me. 

- You think Jose knows how to park the bus? Wait until you see some of your home games, 11 behind the ball, time wasting from the first second. 

- Go to as many away games as possible, whilst their are a few ""chip on their shoulder non league types"" like I mentioned above most fans are so laid back and you will have some of the best away days you have ever had.  

- DO NOT GET ON THE PLAYERS BACKS BECAUSE THEY ARE PLAYING SHITE AGAINST SOME TEAM LIKE WELLING!!! I cannot stress this enough support the players, it may sound the simplest thing but it can be unbelievably frustrating to see your team who you know are capable of so much better play so shit against who you can see are their for the taking. It took too many 5 years to work this out. 

- Maybe most important, enjoy it! You will probably win more games than you lose, you'll lose to some teams and think what are we doing but you will also thrash some others too and think you are back in business. 

I say all that thinking you will be up their challenging, just please, please dont do a Stockport!

Which ""traditional ways of life"" do *you* think they're referring to? 

Their statements are:

* technology was evolving too quickly - ""too quickly"" means that it must be quicker compared to something else. I assume it's their ability to deal with and/or accept the changes. Or maybe they would prefer a slower rate of technological change?

* undermining traditional ways of life - Not sure which ""traditional ways of life"" they mean here. If it's about technology, then I can name plenty of technologies which have undermined previous traditions. e.g. gun powder displaced fletchers, rubber tyres displaced wheelwrights. i.e. technology replaced certain skillsets, and trades.

Then I can name some social traditions which have evolved with techonology (in rough chronological order):  campfire stories and dancing, classical musical recitals, wireless (radio) plays, live television shows, pre-recorded television shows, on-demand video, multi-screen portable video.

Then we have ""reading traditions"". From rocks walls to clay tablets to scrolls to single books owned by a church to mass printing to Kindles.

Regardless of the technology, we still celebrate birthdays, weddings, funerals, Halloween, Christmas, Easter, etc. Those traditions have certainly changed over time but they haven't gone away. Technology won't and can't replace Christmas, or any of those things.
