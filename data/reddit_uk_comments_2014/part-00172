That's precisely where most of his errors originate from; he isn't someone who keeps a cool head. He's prone to rushes of blood to the head, he makes rash decisions, he's not a thinker.

It's what caused him to steam off his line when he shouldn't have in that very game which gave Balotelli the opportunity to loft the ball over his head and score - but for the goal line intervention of Jagielka.

Everyone praises his ""passion"", but it's a character flaw for a goalkeeper, it wholly distorts their ability to make the right calls under pressure.

It's the reason Joe has become renowned for being so error prone.

Medical cover once again shown to be one of the best in the world, just like Aus (where I'm from), but I'm sure your conservatives are trying to take money away from your great system and make you more USA like...the worst system on the planet (considering their outcomes vs cost).

""freeing up the economy"" sounds like a great idea, except that it results in boom-bust cycles, and scams/rip offs/cons by the wealthiest who lack regulation (GFC anyone?) and abuse of the poorest.

Hooray, the rich get richer, and the poor get fucked some more. But the GDP has gone up, right?! Too bad the rising number of poor people mean more crime and more theft. Don't worry, the rich can afford personal guards, they'll be fine! 

Too bad about the middle class though. They keep being robbed, and attacked by the poor. And now the middle class are getting poorer thanks to no minimum wage and ongoing abuses and scams by the banking class. Now we have no middle class. Oh shit, now there is no one for the rich to sell their shit to. And the whole system collapese.

You know it's this kind of thing that left me and many others in complete despair when we hit puberty and realized we were different. It's not just a realization you're one of ""them"", it's coming to terms with the fact you've been given a life sentence of struggle that 95% of other people simply don't have to deal with, and also accepting that they don't really care about you or your struggles either; you're completely on your own. Other minorities are born into a family of minorities, but not you. You truly are alone. 

It's also mourning the life you imagined for yourself, and coming to terms with the fact the life you always imagined for yourself will never happen. It's realizing you will always have to look over your shoulder when you leave the house, and one day in the future your luck might run out, it's accepting a life sentence of fear and the constant threat of violence always lingerering below the surface out of sight, but never out of mind. Knowing that one day soon you will have to tell everybody your secret, or your secret will be found out. You don't know when, but you know that it will have to happen one day, and it will have to happen soon otherwise you become trapped in the sinking sand. It's terrifying!

It's these realizations that make it so difficult when they hit, especially when you're only 12 or 13 it can be so daunting and overwhelming, and sadly many can't make peace with that and decide that this life will be too hard for them to handle, so they quit.

And the video didn't include all of Joe's errors either. Besides the Robben goal, no examples of him being beaten easily at his near post, or his error in decision making at Liverpool which allowed Sterling to slot into an open net.

The idea that Joe's season started badly and was turned around totally is entirely false.

He started terribly (after a poor season the year before also), was dropped, and then he ground it out and improved his reliability for a period, but the errors were still there. And there were prominent examples right at the end of the season.

The Liverpool example I've given, where he steamed off his line needlessly which allowed Sterling to pass into an empty net, and a basic positioning error against Sunderland which allowed them to slot one into his near post and take the lead when we were trying to push for a winner.

That said, he made a couple of stand out saves in that period, the biggest being the one at Goodison.

But there are still too many errors in there, and it is due to Joe's temperament. He's not a cool head, he makes rash decisions, he's not a thinker. It's a massive flaw for a top flight keeper.

I worry that those errors will cost us big time next season, we were very lucky that they didn't cost us the title this season.

Joe's not young anymore either, he's 27, he doesn't have that excuse any more. I can count 5 keepers in the Premier League that I rate higher than Joe. In no particular order:

- Cech
- De Gea (oh yes)
- Begovic
- Lloris
- Mignolet

&gt; So you do agree that we lost a prime target. Good.

This exact scenario with Mkhitriyan is what happens to all teams.  It even happens to Chelsea, PSG, and Man City.  Sometimes players choose to go somewhere else.  Here we probably made the mistake of thinking we had it wrapped up before we did.

&gt; Even thgough we have the money, we will still try not to pay by their terms and once again lose out a prime target. 

That is called negotiating.  And it is more than just ""having the money.""  They have to weigh out what depleting that much at one time would do to the finances.  There is much more to running a football club than just buying and selling.  Sheesh, it's like you only know about running a club through Football Manager.

&gt;This despite the fee being agreed which means we have money but are a clusterfuck internally. 

Talk about slippery slope.  It does not mean we are a clusterfuck internally, it means we have guidelines to how we are willing to run the club.  Chelsea and Man City can pay whatever because their business model is different.  We don't have the same kind of backing, so meeting our evaluations matters to the business model set in place.

&gt; So we're wasting time, in short when we know we cant afford the likes of Mkhitriyan but we'll just window shop while buying cheap quality fillers and not putting that window shopping effort into targeting players who may actually make a difference and are affordable.

What on Earth are you talking about?  We met the price on Mkhitriyan; he just chose to go somewhere else.  We can meet the price on players that meet certain criteria (backed by management and upper management values them at the right price).  It's not window shopping.  LIke where are you getting any of this from?

&gt; Good, you're saying exactly what I am. We're a joke to an extent.

What?  No... not at all.  We are a moderately sized club that does not compete with the super clubs on a transfer level.  We don't overpay based on our evaluations.  That makes us a joke?  Whatever.  You really are delusional.

&gt; You're stating we have money. Then you're stating its the calculations, then you're saying we just ask around for players and dont bid. Is exactly what I'm saying. We have no plan B and when we lose a prime target each time, we end up looking like clowns in the market.

Ummmm none of that is what I am saying.  We only have the money when the calculated ROI or return on investment is deemed worthy.  We evaluate players and don't move past it.  Transfers under the FSG model aren't just buy and sell; there are a lot more factors.  Quit simplifying; it shows you know not what you are talking about.

&gt; then you're saying we just ask around for players and dont bid.

But when did I ever say anything of the sort?

&gt; So....we have the money....but we dont....make up your mind.

Seriously.  Seriously?  Are you just trying to look stupid?  FSG has money, but to stay financially viable they can't make mistakes like we did with Carroll and Downing.  A lot more goes into the transfers than just having the money or not having the money: evaluations, ROI, financial stability, etc.  Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh.

&gt; Suffices to see that you're more or less agreeing that we are a joke in the market. Lowballing, window sopping, not tabling bids, just showing interest, losing out primer targets etc....I'd say we need to sort ourselves out transfer wise.

You have literally no idea what you are talking about.  Lowballing is always done.  Window shopping? What?  Not tabling bids?  WHere did that come from.

Especially during the summer, ESPECIALLY during a month where we're going to have literally no other Spurs specific news to discuss (As they're all watching the WC too), and triple especially because literally the only other thing to discuss is ""I saw this guy play for the first time and think we should spend 30 million pounds+ for him yesterday"" threads (which are infinitely more annoying), a little break from the monotony is nice.

In the same vein as the Bale/Modric threads that frequent this sub and are loudly and roundly shouted down, there is a time and a place for this.  Had Dempsey (or even Defoe) scored a big goal in a big MLS game during Spurs' season, I wouldn't care to see that on our sub, but there are occasions when it is perfectly fine to allow people to be a little excited and allow others to share in said excitement-- this, in my opinion, being one of them.  Just imagine if Defoe had scored a massive goal for England-- I would think that the American contingent of this sub would be perfectly happy for the British subscriber base, as we're all (supposed) to be a family, rather than a petty and sniping firm like they are over at some *other* subs, and part of that is allowing, embracing, and joining in on other people's emotional moments, when they are well deserved (as this one certainly was).

I said this to /u/Waffuls, who I don't think's a bad guy whatsoever, but I think his issue was that he came off like he was just trying to piss in everyone's cheerios, even though he was completely correct, and not rude whatsoever-- it just was poorly timed, and not really in the spirit of the moment, which really was quite special.

Tor alone is absolutely not 90 percent of the internet infact most of the domains in tor can fit on to one page of links called the hidden wiki, you will know it if you have ever used tor.

the hidden net is a far wider definition encompassing the internet most users never access such as government ftp servers etcetra and most of it is mundane to say the least. Goverment records,University Studies that sort of stuff.

The reason why Tor is now being talked down by authorities is not because of circumvention of blocking or anything like that, its about slowly stripping this country of free access to the internet in accordance to what america and china demand.

You didn't think all home hubs from bt are made in china by a state owned firm and contact US intelligence base fort huachua and The department of defence when they start up for nothing did ya?

Its a condition of America and China investing in the country, the new shanghai copied london dock didn't come without conditions you know.

Its also why British Telecom can lay fibre optic cable to ethiopia to launch drones but can't pull its finger out its arse to lay fibre optic cable around most of the south east without european money. Which it takes and uses to subsidise streaming sports companies.

The problem with this way of thinking is that there are those whose lives will be fucked with by GCHQ, and there's a collective responsibility on everyone's part to stop that from happening. For analogy's sake lets consider the security of nuclear material. Individually most people are extremely unlikely to ever be victim of a dirty bomb, or nuclear weapon, but radioactive or fissible material falling into the wrong hands is still a collective concern.

You brush off worrying about GCHQ based purely on an appraisal of the likelihood that anything bad will come of it. You don't take into account the magnitude of what could happen should anything go wrong.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Certainly there are differences.  I would argue modern China rejected Socialism of any sort (either national socialist or marxist socialist) the moment Deng Xiaoping stood outside and announced that 'to get rich is glorious' or whatever it was he said exactly.    Mao was ideologically very Marxist, far more so in fact than Stalin or even Lenin in many ways.  But that fervour died with him in many respects, China today is just a good old fashioned oligarchy run by a Party Elite.   

If one was to look at the political scale as  'statist' on one side and 'liberal' on the other, then China (due to its economic freedoms and the fact that you can leave if you want) is significantly further to the right than Stalinist Russia (or Maoist China for that matter).   But it is nowhere near as liberal as our own democracies.    What I am arguing is that on said scale, both Fascism and Socialism in practice tend significantly towards the left hand (or statist) side.   They both stand for government control of society and to a degree, the economy.    By contrast, the far right hand side of the scale would be dominated by Anarchism and Libertarianism.  Two ideologies that are quite different in their relationship with property, for example, but share a fundamental distaste for the State.

&gt;People want to be proud of their history and their values, but for the last 10-15 years they have been told that it is more important to be accepting of others, that other peoples culture is more important

What complete and utter bollocks. It's as if the average British citizen only has room in their head for a limited set of information and knowledge of a sari would push the battle of Hastings right out of their head.

No one has been told not to be proud of British history. Show me where such a thing has ever happened. Is this councils banning hot cross buns again? You usually hear bullshit like this from those revisionists who want to be proud of the *less* gleaming bits of British history without the blowback that would inevitably come their way. Heaven forbid someone highlight the hypocrisy of celebrating trundling off to another persons country to imposed your language, religion and culture on them as a form of fighting people coming to your country seemingly imposing their language, religion and culture on you. Lets have a Mau Mau slaughter parade!

I mean, I'm pretty sure I've just witnessed the whole nation celebrating one of the most heroic of British generations, yet I'm supposed to believe that the events I've witnessed on my TV from France and at national monuments across the country are apparently banned by the ""so called PC brigade"".

This campaign is political pandering to a vocal minority who put the fear of god into a political class that are well equipped to counter it with nonsensical red herrings and buzz words. I somehow managed to learn to tie my shoelaces and wipe my arse without it being on the school syllabus. British values are strong enough without there needing to be a bloody class for it.

Clearly it would be incorrect for me to say 'My three friends approve of gay marriage, therefore all Muslims agree with gay marriage'. However, it is equally faulty to *fail* to include my Muslim friends when you construct your survey. So here is my evidence that the survey has been run incorrectly;

400 Muslims surveyed, 400 disapprove of gay marriage. This means that - according to the test - the true proportion of Muslims who disapprove of gay marriage will be somewhere between 0.987 and 1.000 (99% confidence). Note that this applies to ALL Muslims, regardless of where I sample from; a properly conducted test will account for the fact that I have liberal friends.

So suppose we sample a Muslim at random from the general population. Would you be prepared to bet me Â£76 for every Â£1 I bet that that Muslim would be against gay marriage? If not, you yourself don't agree the survey is unbiased.

In fact, I'd be prepared to carry out this test publicly if you want; I bet you one month of reddit gold versus you buying me two years of reddit gold that a randomly selected Muslim on reddit is in favour of gay marriage. If you won't take up this bet then *you yourself do not agree with the results of this survey* and you should either put up or shut up.

I can fill in the details about how to 'randomly' sample someone on reddit and elicit their preference in a publicly confirmable way once you've agreed to the test in principle.

That does not effect your equity. If the price of a 250k house stays at 250k until say, 2025 - you're no worse off except for the proportional value of your home to your wage is lower.

Now, aside from your own personal greed and economic principals why would that be a bad thing in theory?

true,lak47,lfc87,,"&gt; I have come to the conclusion that you are an idiot. You just flat out don't know what you are talking about. Go play FIFA.

Ok. 

&gt; You are starting to waste my time as you have no idea what you are talking about and are just looking like a naive child.

Well you have the option not to reply. 

&gt; That is called negotiating. And it is more than just ""having the money."" They have to weigh out what depleting that much at one time would do to the finances. There is much more to running a football club than just buying and selling. Sheesh, it's like you only know about running a club through Football Manager.

You come about as a condescending one. However, stop making shitty assumptions that anyone who wishes to argue what you think is talking on the basis of FM or FIFA. This is what defines a superfan. 

Now, if we keep negotiating deals and fail everyone of those, it's called losing prime targets. 
Mkhitriyan chose Dortmund for whatever reason, it is the club managements duty to make sure he does exactly the opposite. Convince him by hook or crook if you are committed to the cause, which you dont seem to understand and think that losing our main targets is OK.

&gt; What? No... not at all. We are a moderately sized club that does not compete with the super clubs on a transfer level. We don't overpay based on our evaluations. That makes us a joke? Whatever. You really are delusional.

Really? So we know our limitations about being moderately sized and yet want to compete for unrealistic targets. Waste of time. Rather focus on targets we can get. Yes indeed, that makes us a joke. Keep talking about big targets to the fans and then sign the likes of Aspas and Lamberts (with all due respect)

&gt; Ummmm none of that is what I am saying. We only have the money when the calculated ROI or return on investment is deemed worthy. We evaluate players and don't move past it. Transfers under the FSG model aren't just buy and sell; there are a lot more factors. Quit simplifying; it shows you know..

You work with FSG isnt it? Or are you their chief accountant? Telling me exactly what they think and not. Right. Prima facie as fans we take things on face value. Till now, we've missed targets. All our top ones. That's the fact, whether you like it or not. 

Mkhitriyan

Willian

Eriksen

Salah

Papadapoulos

Dempsey

Siggurdson

Moreno

&gt; But when did I ever say anything of the sort?

In your post previous to this one. 

&gt; Seriously. Seriously? Are you just trying to look stupid? FSG has money, but to stay financially viable they can't make mistakes like we did with Carroll and Downing. A lot more goes into the transfers than just having the money or not having the money: evaluations, ROI, financial stability, etc. Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh.

FSG has money. No doubting that. But the way this club does transfers is a joke. Since the days of Perry the clown missing out on Ronaldo to Mkhitriyan to Willian and possibly Lallana we have the same problem year after year window after window. 

&gt; A lot more goes into the transfers than just having the money or not having the money: evaluations, ROI, financial stability, etc. 

Then what am I saying? Despite the money and fees for players how the fuck do you miss out so many targets? 
The lot more you're talking about is exactly where we're losing out. Not having someone who can get transfers done and get the players we want is a big loss and a missing link.

&gt; You have literally no idea what you are talking about. Lowballing is always done. Window shopping? What? Not tabling bids? WHere did that come from.

Well as a matter of fact, I think I do. Lowballing is OK to an extent. Asking around for players and not even tabling bids is called wasting time. Ayre asking and inquiring and then us expressing interest and not bidding or getting outbid is where the problems lie.

&gt; I have come to the conclusion that you are an idiot. You just flat out don't know what you are talking about. Go play FIFA.

I have concluded that you are a condescending person who throughout your post has gotten down to personal insults. I'm not going to fall down to your level.

Of those, you can bet that about 40ish will put me as an Insurance choice, and then in August go to their Firm, and some will just miss the grades entirely. Some may even put UoS as their firm and go with their insurance in August.

What universities do is deliberately oversell the course. The BSc in Awesome might offer 170 places, anticipating 70 drop off. 

How good Universities are at guessing how many of their offers actually become students is the basis for how easy it is to get a place on Results Day. 

* If you're offered a place, you get a place. Even if all 170 students accept the offer for my fictional university, I have to let them in.

* if I under-offer, then I'll be left with an excess of places. Here is where Universities tend to lower their entry requirements slightly.

Of the two, the second is much more preferable to a University. But they try to keep it as close to perfect as they can. They're also going to know this about a week before you do, so they can figure out if they need to offer places to lower grades (or Clearing students).

I hope that that makes sense. **In short: the university can't really tell you right now because they don't know how it'll be for them on the day either**

Neither he, nor the cartoon were anything like the pillars of British TV culture they are regarded as today.

Plenty of people are of the opinion that there is nothing to be proud of. And if you mention you are the reply is well you didn't have anything to do with it.

&gt;Heaven forbid someone highlight the hypocrisy of celebrating trundling off to another persons country to imposed your language, religion and culture on them as a form of fighting people coming to your country seemingly imposing their language, religion and culture on you. Lets have a Mau Mau slaughter parade!

Its comments like this that I am talking about. People acting like British history is somehow more brutal than the history of any other country on earth. While other nations can be proud of the achievement of their past there are always those in Britain who have to throw up their hands to complain about all the horrible things we did in the past. Britain didn't invent slavery, its been going on for thousands of years. 

And nothing of what you have said explains why British people find it so difficult to define their values.

true,Irmuhlay,,Sixth Form,"Aim for the highest marks in controlled assessments possible - you've only got one shot at the exams, and getting good marks in your controlled assessments will take some of the pressure off in the exam. Also, even if you're better at exams than controlled assessments, things can go drastically wrong on the day. I had pneumonia during my GCSE exams, and got Bs in some exams - but my controlled assessment brought my grades back up.

If you've done some controlled assessments already which haven't got the grades you want, ask if you can redo them. My teachers thought I was mad when I resat low A\* controlled assessments, but sometimes one or two marks was all I needed to secure the grades I wanted. I don't think my GCSE grades were due to an innate ability, they were due to hard work and perfectionism.

If you don't understand something which you've covered already, go over it every now and then to help to fix it in your mind. Use Bitesize, revision guides, Sparknotes, SAMLearning, asking a friend/teacher - whatever works for you. Aim to master the whole syllabus in the subjects you want to get A\*s in.

Attend revision sessions. I found that being given a little recap on stuff plus some exam questions really helped.

Do past papers. You've probably fully covered some of your units now, so you should be able to answer some full exam papers. Testing yourself helps you to learn it and identifies areas you're weak on. Also look at the mark schemes - sometimes the examiners look for the same answers every year, so you can learn exactly what a question is asking for.

Remember to work efficiently when you're revising - it's a waste of time to do 100 Pythagoras' Theorem questions if you're really good at geometry. You could do a few examples just to refresh your memory in five minutes, then move onto something that you find more difficult.

Taking breaks is fine - there's no point in working for six hours straight if you're not taking anything in after the second hour. Studying little and often usually works.

Give creative subjects a bit more time. Subjects like Art, Drama and Music are fairly difficult to get an A\* in because the mark schemes are quite ambiguous. If you can, find some examples of A\* work in these subjects and work out what sets these pieces of work apart from an A or B grade.",0,1403026534,null,0,false,0,ci9ylch,t3_28cnom,t1_ci9ylch,t3_28cnom,null,1434280507,5,false,GCSE,t5_2u3gk,5

Let me put it like this - in some authoritarian Islamic states, women are forced to wear the burqa. We consider this to be immoral and oppressive behaviour in the west. Yet a blanket ban on wearing it is essentially the same thing - imposing your subjective moral beliefs on somebody else. It is not only hypocritical but exacerbates the problem.

And that's the fault of some external force how? We, as far as I was aware, already have a subject taught in schools called ""history"" where I was taught about Britain's past, the various peoples that settled here and conquered here to make it the place it was. The battles, the monarchs, the journey from feudal serfdom to democracy. Picts, Celts, Romans, Vikings, Normans, Angles, Saxons. What schools did these ""many"" people attend and how is it anyone else's fault they don't know their own history?

&gt;Its comments like this that I am talking about. People acting like British history is somehow more brutal than the history of any other country on earth.

Oh please, don't get all precious. The fact is you're moaning due to the lack of the converse. You want British history to be more blameless and full of glory than any other country on Earth. It's not a bloody either or. You can't have one without the other.

&gt;And nothing of what you have said explains why British people find it so difficult to define their values.

Because it's not something that needs bloody defining! There doesn't need to be a bloody list telling you what makes you you. Did you need it up until this point in your life? Have you been living some other life you're unhappy with?

Here's a simply question for you:

To a large extent, to GCHQ, it doesn't matter if people use VPNs or not.  The VPN just means your traffic appears to come from a VPN provider rather than your house; if they're monitoring from within Google data centres, etc., then that doesn't matter, they still know what you're searching for...

They've got access to enough information and enough computing power to synchronise the traffic coming out of a VPN with the times you're feeding traffic into a VPN!

Combined with the mobile phone tracking powers the spy agencies have, they know everything you've read and everyone you've spoken to, and it what order.

This isn't really about searching for specific evidence of criminality.  This is about identifying and neutralising anyone deemed to be a threat.  Combine this with vague and far reaching terrorism laws, where reading something written by alleged radicals is ""material likely to aide terrorism"", and you have the powers to really lock-up anyone for any reason.

At the moment the only people likely to fall-foul of this are militant islamists.  But don't forget it was only a year ago that the government wanted to give the same level of powers to the police, immigration officers and HMRC.

It's not hyperbolic to say we have the full mechanism required for industrial scale persecution, to a level that would have given Stalin a spontaneous orgasm.  We're not there yet, but it'll need everyone to remain vigilant to stop it from happening.

Posting pictures would make no difference, as only 1 of the 4 companies makes one that's truly accurate to the filming prop. The rest are eyesores (in my not at all humble opinion.)

1 - Nick Robatto worked in conjunction with QmX to release the Artisan Series 11th Doctor Sonics at Â£2500 a piece. Limited to a run of 25. (I think) QmX has mentioned plans to replicate the sonic, but that was a long time ago and we still haven't seen a thing.

Price: About $4000

2 - The Wand Company offers a Universal Remote control Sonic that was never touted as a replica, only as a remote. I believe it's closest relative is the Wow stuff multi-tool version.

Price: About $100

3 - As previously mentioned, Wow! Stuff makes a screwdriver that has lights, sound, and functioning screwdriver bits. It pulls apart to reveal the storage space for the bits, which are held in place by a magnet in the bottom when being used. The top half is plastic, while the bottom is die cast (I think) Metal.

Price: About $30

4 - Character Options makes the most commonly seen sonic. The spring loaded Toy Version which technically counts as a screen accurate prop replica because it was used in Rings of Akhaten ""I'm armed...with a screwriver"" Comes with light and 4 sounds. The bottom opens to reveal a red button, which is present on the filming prop.

price: about $20


5 - My personal favorite, The Celestial Toystore makes a replica that's beyond description. It's perfectly accurate, and true to the very one seen on screen. Fully flickable (as hard as you like), lights and sound. This one is not for the faint of heart.

Price: about $1700

Italy though, isn't a great place to mooch off, so the migrants tend to then head for France, Germany, or the UK.

Unfortunately because of the way the EU works we can't just summarily send these people back to Libya, and due to laws of the sea the Italian coast guard are obliged to render aid to vessels in trouble, so essentially the Italians go out every day and rescue a few thousand more Africans who're then essentially let loose in southern Europe to make their way towards northern Europe.

true,ir_h,flair8,,"IF England are to accomplish anything at the World Cup they must come together as a band of brothers.

The heartache of the last decade has seen the majority of England fans write off their team's chances this summer.

It is understandable, considering recent failures, but it is also wrong.

England DO have a chance of going all the way. I know their quality from playing against their stars in the Premier League.

But it all depends on whether Roy Hodgson's boys can come together as a team.

Max People talk about how England's players have struggled to cope under the pressure in recent years. Pressure? Try playing for Brazil!

The expectation is cranked up to the max on our players yet we have still managed to win the World Cup five times â and the reason is we play as a team.

We are never a group of individuals and that is what England must strive to achieve.

Unless you have everybody fighting for the cause, it does not matter â you will not win.

England's squad need to be best friends, to come together as a family. If one of them is struggling, they need to help each other out. If they can do that, they have as good a chance as anyone because no one who has played against their stars at club level is in any doubt over how good they can be.

My country, Brazil, are one of the favourites â and rightly so, considering our glittering history plus we are the hosts.

But I do not see too many differences between our Samba boys and England's men in white. Every player in their squad, barring Celtic's Fraser Forster, plays in the best league in the world â the Premier League.

And the majority of them also regularly play at the highest club level in the Champions League.

So they have to be taken seriously â only a fool would write them off.

If I had to pick four stand-out players they would be Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Gary Cahill and Leighton Baines.

I've faced all of them on a number of occasions with Tottenham.

Roy Hodgson is blessed with some of the best in the world in those positions.

Rooney and Gerrard are obvious choices of course â they have been at the top of the sport for a decade now.

Crucial And while some may be more surprised to see me pick Cahill and Baines, those who have played the game would not be.

Cahill is so strong and such a tough opponent to play against while Baines is a constant threat down the left, armed with a superb delivery from crosses and set-pieces.

What will be crucial, though, is whether they can come together and play for each other.

The best part about Dele Alli is his commitment to specific roles in the squad. He started out wide early on last season and you could tell he'd been working on his ball control and composure. Then he picked up an injury, and spent a month or two working INSANELY hard to bulk up in order to play a central role. He came back and gradually made the holding midfield his own, at the expense of former Liverpool player Darren Potter. By the end of the season, he was the most consistent and dangerous player in he side by a distance.

Dele is also very disciplined. He isn't like other youngsters in the sense that rather than pulling out bags of tricks from his debut, he was mature and reserved when given chances, and only when he was a first team player did he then start pulling out tricks and fancy passes.

The second time, I got an appointment with the practice nurse in less than a  week. Was told to put olive oil in for ten days or so and come back. Ear syringed and a foreign object revealed, which the practice nurse removed with tweezers.

The only issue is that ear problems aren't usually considered an emergency and so in our practice we need to wait for about a week for an appointment. This was a problem for my wife when she developed earache just before we were due to go on holiday. Thankfully after some discussion the practice fitted in a appointment with the practice nurse next day and it all got sorted.

true,EarwormsRUs,null,null,"So, you've got substantial anxiety and would like to overcome that. There's nothing embarrasing about having anxiety - typically it's caused by a neurological issue, so it's no different to having a weak arm or suffering migraine - go see your GP. It might help you to know that it's common for anxiety/depression to impede learning, it's more difficult for the brain to take on new information/skills.

In my area GPs tend to help anxious patients in any of a number of ways including [CBT](http://www.patient.co.uk/health/cognitive-behavioural-therapy-cbt-leaflet) and/or medication, and/or helping them access a social worker and/or advocate. If you'd like to have your own place to live sooner or later, mention this as **there are a number of organisations that specialise in housing people who need a little help to live alone**, such as [P3](http://www.p3charity.org/page/listing&amp;category=housing#) - your GP should know who the local ones are. P3 are national, and do feel free to [contact P3 directly yourself](http://www.p3charity.org/Pages/Contact.aspx).

Also speak with the GP about claiming Employment and Support Allowance. This way you will be able to access courses etc that will help you find employment as a person disadvantaged due to a health issue.

You however don't need to first see your GP to claim [Personal Independence Payment](https://www.gov.uk/pip). As you struggle to use the phone, ask a parent, friend or someone at the [Citizens Advice Bureau](http://www.adviceguide.org.uk/england/about_this_site/get_advice.htm) to commence a claim for you. 

I'd also suggest you drop a line to Mind. There's an [email address here](http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/helplines/) - just send them a copy of your OP and see what they have to offer :-)

Please do reach out for financial and practical help - it'll take some strain off your parents.

I worked for Morrisons up until December of last year and held many different positions including management, working across a variety of stores in the company. Towards the end of my tenure, I observed a marked change in the Business. The old school of 'safeway' managers that once were had all but jumped ship. Their once polished departments and excellent staff teams are now a thing of the past. Only skeleton staff now remain who, in no fault of their own, simply cannot keep the departments running to the same standard as they were 10 years ago. The Department Managers who are in the stores now are finding themselves in a position where their knowledge and expertise on stocks, orders, sales and even scheduling is now simply not needed. In fact, because they now find themselves in the business at peak hours to get stock out to fill shelves, also constantly being used to bail out ambiant grocery, or doing various other jobs other than their own, most of the stock counting and various other similar jobs are undertaken by assistants anyway.

I witnessed a once excellent Produce Department, at its peak employing 20 staff and always turning great profits, go to less than 10 staff, only five of which were full time, two being the Manager and Supervisor. Oh yes, and the store had recently been refitted giving them a bigger department. The Manager and Supervisor found themselves there just to fill shelves. Looking at Morrisons currently, of course you would cut these management staff, like it or not the business can run without them. Their departments can be managed by the Duty and Deputy Managers and Shift Supervisors can take care of the rest. 

It's very sad and I can't say I agree with it. However, I saw this coming a mile away and left to persue a different career path. This will not be the last of the staff cuts and I expect to see more in the future. 

I feel a lot of talented and committed Managers I had the pleasure of working with will be affected by this, it's sad indeed. ",0,1403038367,null,0,false,0,cia4tb5,t3_28d5zc,t1_cia4tb5,t1_ci9v9y0,null,1434283504,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

&gt;The __Monarchy of Denmark__ ([Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language): *KongerÃ¦kken*), colloquially known as the __Danish Monarchy__, is a [constitutional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution) [institution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_institution) and a historic office of the [Kingdom of Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark). The Kingdom includes not only Denmark, but the [autonomous regions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Realm) of [Greenland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland) and the [Faroe Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faroe_Islands). The monarchy is currently represented by the [Queen Margrethe II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margrethe_II_of_Denmark), who ascended the throne on the death of her father, [King Frederik IX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_IX_of_Denmark), on 14 January 1972. Danish [regnal names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regnal_name) have traditionally alternated between ""Frederik"" and ""Christian""; Margrethe has taken the place of a Christian, and accordingly her [heir apparent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heir_apparent) is [Frederik, Crown Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik,_Crown_Prince_of_Denmark).

Pertinently, all these players have improved in recent years. Joe has developed no further from the player he was 4 years ago, and in fact has been regressing for the last 2 years.

Look at Courtois, he's just 22 years old and has shown constant signs of improvement. He's already regarded as one of the best keepers in Europe, was number one for a team that just won La Liga and reached the Champions League final, and is now number one for his country at the World Cup.

I don't think there are any excuses for Joe anymore, he hasn't developed into the player we hoped he would, and if he continues his form of recent years then he won't make the grade at a top 8 side, let alone a side challenging for titles domestically and in Europe.",0,1403041491,null,0,false,0,cia6e6f,t3_28d0qr,t1_cia6e6f,t1_cia241b,null,1434284248,0,false,MCFC,t5_2s14k,0

&gt;(c)for the purpose of safeguarding the economic well-being of the United Kingdom; or

&gt;(d)for the purpose, in circumstances appearing to the Secretary of State to be equivalent to those in which he would issue a warrant by virtue of paragraph (b), of giving effect to the provisions of any international mutual assistance agreement.

There are two parts of this which are significant.  Paragraph (c) could be extremely wide in scope, while paragraph (d) could (and probably does) refer to [the UKUSA Agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UKUSA_Agreement), which originated as a Cold War intelligence sharing operation and is thought to be the basis for the Anglophone world's vast system of introspective surveillance.

That deals with the reasoning for warrants, but slightly more pernicious is the supposed protections within RIPA.  Section 8(1) reads:
&gt;(1)An interception warrant must name or describe eitherâ

&gt;(a)one person as the interception subject; or

&gt;(b)a single set of premises as the premises in relation to which the interception to which the warrant relates is to take place.

BUT, section 8(4) reads:

&gt;(4)Subsections (1) and (2) shall not apply to an interception warrant ifâ

&gt;(a)the description of communications to which the warrant relates confines the conduct authorised or required by the warrant to conduct falling within subsection (5); and

&gt;(b)at the time of the issue of the warrant, a certificate applicable to the warrant has been issued by the Secretary of State certifyingâ

&gt;(i)the descriptions of intercepted material the examination of which he considers necessary; and

&gt;(ii)that he considers the examination of material of those descriptions necessary as mentioned in section 5(3)(a), (b) or (c).

I know how much playing at this World Cup means to him, and he hasn't had a look in.

In the first game Paulinho was bang average, in the second tonight against Mexico he was garbage and stunk the place out.

In the first game Scolari brought on Hernandes and Ramires (both central midfielders) Fernandinho completely overlooked.

In the second Scolari went with 3 central midfielders and Ramires started.

Overlooked again. Kept Paulinho on while he played terribly, while Mexico players strolled past him again and again, no look in for Fernandinho, didn't even get to warm up.

If he doesn't start in the next game I don't think we'll see him play a single minute at this tournament, and that would be a fucking travesty.

After the season he's had, with all his qualities, he's overlooked for Scolari's favourite and a bang average runner like Ramires.

Complete and utter joke. I'm pissed off for him.

He could give Brasil a lot, either in Paulinho's box to box role, or Gustavo's holding role.

Moronic to not give him an opportunity, hope it costs Brasil in all honesty.

Eight Member States have investment agreements with the USA.

&gt;

&gt;__Conformal coating__ material is applied to [electronic circuitry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_circuitry) to act as protection against moisture, dust, chemicals, and temperature extremes that, if uncoated (non-protected), could result in damage or failure of the electronics to function. When electronics must withstand harsh environments and added protection is necessary, most circuit board assembly houses coat assemblies with a layer of transparent conformal coating rather than [potting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potting_(electronics\)).

Honestly I'm all smiles that Netherlands spanked Spain. I don't necessarily outright dislike Spain, I'm just kinda tired of seeing them win shit and I really had doubts with Netherlands being able to put up a fight against Spain due to their relatively young defense. It was also awesome to see Robben not be much of a ball hog.


I enjoyed the Belgium-Algeria game, it was pretty tame but when Algeria got that pk, the fire really lit under Belgium's ass and they kicked into gear. Honestly I get Wilmots lineup decision since ""it's only Algeria and shouldn't be a game to stress bigger guns like Fellaini and Mertens"", but I'm glad to see once subbed on they really were the ones to make the difference.  Excellent goals.

I was absolutely stunned how Costa Rica sliced up Uruguay, they literally exploited every weakness and took full advantage.

The Brazil Mexico game was also quality stuff. I was rooting for Mexico and I have to say at many times they easily were outplaying the hell out of Brazil. After the two games Brazil has played, they really don't seem as intimidating as I thought they were going to be. They are gonna have to fight pretty hard.

Lastly the corner US had for their winner was absolutely perfect, not too low or too high, planets aligned and it was in such a sweet spot.

A constitution is a contract between the government and the people. The people say, we allow you to govern over certain areas as long as you abide by certain rules. This puts limits on what the government can do (in many countries the judicial system is able to declare certain laws as unconstitutional and hold the government to account). 
This allows protections for citizens (e.g. fair trial, citizenship, freedom of speech) and means legislation is subject to a higher degree of scrutiny on important issues.

Diet coke and Coke Zero are different because they have completely different recipes. When diet coke was manufactured, they realised that removing the sugar from normal coke and replacing it with sweetener made it taste gross, so instead Coca Cola manufactured a new kind of coke with a different recipe and no sugar. When they finally figured out how to re-create the original (I say original, I guess it's the most well known form of coke today), people were still invested in buying diet coke due to the benefits of less sugar. Coca Cola realised they could keep selling the diet version AND introduce coke zero at the same time. On the plus side, apparently men prefer coke zero because it's not dressed up to be for women trying to lose weight. 

Personally? I'm not a fan of either. I had anorexia when I was 16-18 and basically lived on coke zero. To me, it tastes like sadness and hunger.

You can have both. The UK also has Parliamentary Sovereignty which I don't think can be coupled with a consultation. This was more important when the balance of power was being fought between the Monarch and Parliament. 

Proponents of the UK's lack of a codified constitution argue that it allows Parliament to be more versatile in making laws and that a constitution ties down future generations with old values. They also say it has worked fine for the UK in the past 300 years. 

People that support a constitution argue that the versatility is too dangerous and prone to abuse, that constitutions are not necessarily  immutable (just subject to higher degree of support to enact changes e.g. referendums, super majorities in Parliament) and that they form the basis for many countries throughout the world.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Sorry but this is not right. 100M &amp; 1G over legacy UK copper in ducting is nigh on impossible at the moment. The last mile is the biggest issue and always has been. Nortel for instance had metro switches that could shift multi Gb of Data as a backhaul from multiple DSLAMs in '99 (Passport/Optera etc). Their main DSLAM, UE9000, had 2x155Mb with a max of 150 DSL connections. Usually the 2x155Mb were 4x2Mb.

A few issues spring to mind 

1. notch filters created by taps in the lines that disrupt the xDSL training protocol frequencies. Mainly legacy party lines and other left overs for GPO era.
2. Aluminium cable galore especially in 70s/80s era building projects. The electrical difference between Cu -&gt; Al -&gt; Cu causes all kinds of headaches for xDSL as the capacitance and resistance changes at random points way along the line. This ramps up the noise floor.
3. With xDSL the issue between DSLAMs and CPE on the last mile is the crosstalk. Yes in 1999 I had 8Mb/1.2Mb over 1km of cat V on it's own in a lab - it can be done. I could get 24Mb/3.5Mb in 2004 under the same conditions. However, to repeat that stably over a consumer population, with the codecs of the time was impossible.

That's really my point - all the hard work in DSL goes in to improving last mile codecs to improve resilience and stability when you have &gt;50 line all jabbering away in one duct/bindle. So in fact, it is the weakest link, but they are constantly finding new ways of reinforcing it.

Where did you get 5:1 contention back then? Did you specifically pay for that or did you have a quiet network around you? Typical network design back at the end of the kilostream/megstream era over ADSL was 20:1+ this was a time when backhauls were ATM, usually ATM-IMA over multiple 2Mb E1 links or an E3. Maybe if you were lucky a 155Mb OC3/STM1 but even then your DSLAM would be *full* of ADSL line cards.

true,[deleted],null,null,"well there's a bit of a glut in advice for you here already and i dont really know how to put it in a way that will hit home with you, as its one thing for you to read this and a whole different thing for you to truely take this on board, in the same way that people can hear very good advice thousands of times in the form of trite sayings that everyone knows, yet only after experiencing things themselves do they truely take on board the meaning of the sayings. 

very easy for me to say dont worry what people think of you and all that ""just b urself :-)"" stuff, but that's what would really help you to do imho, try to think about what other people think of you and consider how that's actually going to change your life, in most cases it really isnt going to have any actual effect on anything but your mind. almost everyone you will ever come across doesnt really give two shits about you or anything you do so long as it isnt completely remarkeable and/or doesnt cause them or their business significant harm, you can say something kind of dumb to somebody and chances are 60 seconds later in conversation they'll have forgotten it anyway, and if they havent what are they even going to do?

social awkwardness is not at all uncommon, and half the people who arent socially awkward have some level of anxiety i think either way, if the people you're talking to arent more focused on their own concerns and anxieties than any dumb shit you might come out with, they're certainly used to all kinds of socially awkward people talking to them anyway and are not going to be surprised by whatever you come out with. people on the phone for example, i guarantee you anybody who works with a telephone next to them has regularly encountered far more problematic people than yourself, even if something you say pisses them off somehow, people piss each other off all the time, what's the damage? think it over and try to keep this in your head next time you find yourself getting anxious.

in general the way to approach problems of any sort is to first stop and just identify it, then break it down into small manageable pieces, write it down even, if at any point you find a problem too big, break it down into its parts, if you find those parts too big, break them down further until the required actions are manageable. as if it was some mission or quest from a video game, you dont just start out in a game by charging straight ahead to attack the final boss, you first weigh your own strengths and obstacles, find out all about them, then take clear, gradual steps to strengthen yourself and weaken obstacles in your way to wherever you want to be.

and if you find yourself not managing at any of that, dont beat yourself up about it, everyone is just the product of their environment and experience, if you find yourself beating yourself up anyway, dont beat yourself up about beating yourself up and so on :P.

for a suggested course of actions, i would say a good thing to do would be to volunteer in a charity shop or something, just walk in, or ask a parent to do it even, find the staff and ask them if they are looking for any volunteers, tell them you are socially anxious and want to get out a bit and build some confidence or whatever you like, these places take on all kinds of volunteers, often folk with disabilities and such but are a good starting point because there's little expectation of you yet you can help out with things and experience the public or atleast other volunteers/staff as and when it suits you, there's really not a lot of pressure on you in such a place, and once you start talking to people and get to know the folks around you, a surprising amount of things can pop up in the way of job offers if you distinguish yourself volunteering. 

anyway hope that helps, had more to say but got too tired thinking and typing,  you know how it is, good luck ask anything you'd like, i once felt quite similar to you and have around 3 years of NEETing experience at this point.",0,1403056404,null,0,false,0,ciacw11,t3_28c8c1,t1_ciacw11,t3_28c8c1,null,1434287374,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

lost his job as a result of the hip damage (can't lift another person on to a bed)
so now he just does odd jobs, and has no health coverage.

but that's not the sad part, the saddest part was that he went through a heart attack at home , he knew he was having a heart attack, but didn't want to call an ambulance, he figured if he calls an ambulance his family will be out 200K$. and if he dies at home , only the cost of the funeral.

but it got worst, the comments chiming in said that what he should have done was leave all ID at home and call an ambulance from the street giving a fake name and address.

He's on a long, well-paid, top-earner, contract with the club. Any potential suitor will have to take this into account as it affects his asking price (Â£6-9m) and potential wages will have to be the same or better (clearly his agent will want more). 

Ross has said on multiple occasions he wants to be the man to lead the club to the premier league. Leaving to a premier league club runs contrary to that goal. However he can't stick with us if we don't match this ambition.

Any championship club is having a laugh if they think they will get him. Cellino isn't that stupid.

A lot therefore comes down to Cellino and the promises he made at the meeting with individual players. If he promises to match the ambitions of ross by investing in the playing squad and Ross sees tangible evidence of this by July pre-season then I think he'll stay. If nothing substantial happens then he will probably and somewhat begrudgingly leave.

&gt; Just defending the terrible transfer policy

I don't know if I was defending it as much as I was noting that it is not as bad as you are making it seem.

&gt; Refusing to pay time and time again is surely missing out targets.

That is just semantics.  One might say it is missing out on targets and another that it is not overpaying.

&gt; We have lost targets time and time again. 

I  think you are making a bigger deal out of that then need be.  The situation is different this year.  There is a world cup right in the middle of the transfer season and this year we have a lot more to offer.  Comparing it to us not overpaying other windows is dishonest.

&gt; Us finishing second has fuck all to do with this

I think it goes to show how all those players we ""missed out on"" were not as necessary as you are making them seem.

&gt; Refusing to even admit some shortcomings with the transfer policy indicates your bias.

Ummmm.  I am being *realistic*.  I am accepting the transfer policy, rather saying we are a joke because of it.  I am not biased to the policy. I am just calling a spade a spade; we refuse to overplay.  Calling not getting a player because of that policy is kind of a misnomer.  Hard to accept it as a shortcoming when it does not fit the policy.

&gt; Ayre is useless. The quicker we get rid of him or get someone more accomplished than him at transfers, we will keep losing out on targets. 

So tired of this sentiment.  You are inferring way too much.  You don't know as much as you think you do about the inner wokrings of LFC, so saying that he is useless is unfounded at best.

However, I will say that just because your friend has what she describes to be allergies (NB: not the same as a medical diagnosis of allergy, which is more specific and excludes food intolerance reactions, eg. Gluten intolerance is not a classical allergy) don't take her advice.

You've already self diagnosed and want advice on how to get your doctor to play along. That's bad medicine. Let the doctor try to diagnose you, but tell him your concerns and give a detailed history. 

Oh, and by the way. If you think ""eliminate x for a month and come back"" is being fobbed off then you're going to be disappointed. In fact resolution of intestinal biopsy features after a gluten elimination diet is the only way to categorically diagnose gluten intolerance, so one of the diagnostic tests- at some stage- would have to be ""eliminate x for a month and come back"". Another thing to realise is that a lot of secondary care allergy referrals have long waiting lists.

TLDR: this is completely the wrong forum for this. Using cheat codes for the GP is one way to ensure you will not get the correct diagnosis anyway. Even if your friend has allergies, they are not capable to diagnosing allergy in you. The best thing to do is make sure the doctor hears about all the symptoms you've been having, what worries you have and then understand it may well not get fixed in one visit.",0,1403064890,null,0,false,0,ciagaqx,t3_28en30,t1_ciagaqx,t3_28en30,null,1434289047,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

From Republic.org.uk, which I linked to above:

""The Queen certainly does have power, including the power to sign international treaties and deploy British troops abroad. [See below.] It's true that most of these ""royal prerogative powers"" are today exercised by government, but that in itself is a serious problem. These powers have been transferred directly from the monarch to the prime minister and don't need the approval of parliament, effectively shutting out the British people from important decisions. That is fundamentally anti-democratic â and it can only happen because we have a monarchy.""

From Wikipedia, if you prefer that source (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom): 

""The office [of Prime Minister] is not established by any constitution or law [see Parliament's own website, below] but exists only by long-established convention, which stipulates that **the monarch must appoint as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons**; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber.""

From Republic.org.uk:

""The Queen and Prince Charles also have the power to veto bills that affect their private interests. Official legal advice makes clear that Queen's and Prince's Consent (as the ""royal veto"" is officially known) is not a mere formality. The process by which consent is obtained provides a clear opportunity for the Queen and the Prince of Wales to influence the shape and content of a bill before it reaches Parliament.""

From multiple sources, and even if you missed the many examples in the news over recent years over Prince Charles' abuse of the power his role as monarch-in-waiting gives him, a basic Google search will furnish you with many more:

http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/oct/30/prince-charles-offered-veto-legislation

""MPs and peers called for the immediate publication of details about the application of the prince's powers which have fuelled concern over his alleged meddling in British politics. ""...anyone who enjoys exceptional influence or veto should exercise it with complete transparency,"" said Andrew George, Liberal Democrat MP for St Ives in Cornwall. ""**The duchy asserts that it is merely a private estate. Most people will be astonished to learn that it appears to have effective powers of veto over the government**.""

http://m.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19959233

""Attorney General Dominic Grieve has blocked the release of private letters the Prince of Wales sent to seven government departments. 

A court ruled last month that the correspondence should be published.

But Mr Grieve said it was an exceptional case where the letters formed part of the prince's ""preparations for kingship"".""

http://m.ibtimes.co.uk/prince-charles-moles-whitehall-defra-cabinet-office-499743

""**Prince Charles has secretly placed aides in key roles in Whitehall departments linked to his principal interests, without the knowledge of government ministers, it has emerged**.

The Prince has **been able to install at least three employees in government departments responsible for drawing up policies that could impinge on his business and political interests**.

Ministers spoke of their shock and anger at not having been informed.""

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9801835/Queen-and-Prince-Charles-using-power-of-veto-over-new-laws-Whitehall-documents-reveal.html

""Internal Whitehall papers prepared by Cabinet Office lawyers show that on one occasion **the Queen vetoed the Military Actions Against Iraq Bill in 1999, which aimed to transfer the power to authorise military strikes against Iraq from the monarch to parliament**. ... Legal scholar John Kirkhope, who fought to access the [internal Whitehall] papers following a freedom of information case, said **the document revealed senior royals have ""real influence and real power**"".

""**There has been an implication that these prerogative powers are quaint and sweet but actually there is real influence and real power, albeit unaccountable**,"" he said.""

From Republic.org.uk:

""Then there's the problem of parliamentary sovereignty. At one point all the power in the land was held by the king or queen. Over time that power moved to parliament and is now held collectively by 650 MPs. However, the fundamental nature of that power hasn't changed â parliament can make or scrap any law it likes, just as the monarch could in the past. This means our freedoms are never really guaranteed because parliament can always decide to remove them. Again, this a direct result of having a monarchy.""

From the UK parliament's  http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/sovereignty/

""**Parliamentary sovereignty is a principle of the UK constitution. It makes Parliament the supreme legal authority in the UK, which can create or end any law**. Generally, the courts cannot overrule its legislation and no Parliament can pass laws that future Parliaments cannot change. Parliamentary sovereignty is the most important part of the UK constitution.""

And finally, a modern example of human rights abuses by UK government made possible by the law allowing the UK monarchy to override parliament:

http://justiceinconflict.org/2014/05/15/an-enduring-shame-the-chagos-islanders-long-fight-for-justice/

""Communities such as the Chagos Islanders were displaced from their homeland of Diego Garcia by the British to facilitate the development of the USâs largest military base, the base from which the US would launch almost every military attack in the Iraq / Afghanistan conflict some 30 â 40 years later. ... The British government bargained for the islands during Independence talks with Mauritius and annexed them as a new British colony (BIOT) in 1965, a measure in direct contravention of UNGA Declaration 1514 (XV) which emphasized that preservation of the territorial integrity of dependent states was to be ensured during de-colonization. **The plan to create this new British colony and then lease it to the US as a military base was done without the consent or knowledge of either the British Parliament or the US Congress. It was achieved by invoking the Order in Council, an archaic law allowing the British Monarch to override Parliament**. ... the case of Chagos Islands has been described as one of Britainâs âmost shameful episodesâ. Arguably, the real shame is with the UK / US governmentâs continuing deception and refusal to grant an effective remedy. Details of the Chagossianâs treatment gained credence after the UK foreign office was legally ordered to release files from the period in 2012. Previously, the government had continued the charade of arguing that the Islanders were not indigenous but rather âcontract labourersâ. ...**In 2000, the Chagossians had their claims of right to return upheld in the UK courts but this was overturned when the government again invoked the Order in Council in 2004** â on general election day so that no-one knew it had even happened! The Orders were successfully challenged in 2006/7 with the Court of Appeal stating it was an abuse of power, but when the claims were finally rejected in the House of Lords in 2008, the House of Lords decided it was a political, rather than a legal matter.""

It's quite simple really. This ideology would let us be less involved in the affairs of everybody else yet rigorously defend our interests. We could spend the money far more effectively, for instance in reducing our dependence on those very countries who we don't like. Saudi Arabia pretend to be our friend, and we have to grit our teeth and call them our allies. But in reality, they are a disgusting country.

I take issue with the way our council have dealt with these matters as they've been biased and dishonest. Bill Randall stood at Elm Grove primary school in front of hundreds of angry people and told them that the proposed permit parking for that area was poorly thought out and he would address the member of the council who proposed it (which turned out to be himself) and then subsequently reduced parking on elm grove by banning people from parking on the wide curbs like they always had done (citing that it hindered access for emergency vehicles despite no such cases being reported) and allowing planning permission for a high rise block of new flats in place of an old piano warehouse which will create a greater need for parking. It wouldn't be too paranoid to think that since the Bill's proposal got mass rejected by the residents that they resolved to make parking so uncomfortable that the residents will be begging for permit parking before long.,0,1403071016,null,0,false,0,ciaia1h,t3_28aom3,t1_ciaia1h,t1_ci9nw31,null,1434289981,2,false,brighton,t5_2qprp,2

Up here in Scotland, Glasgow has the Riverside Museum, which is solely devoted to transport: trains, cars, trams, the subway, bikes, and it even has a square rigged ship parked out the back. Definitely worth a visit, as is Kelvingrove Museum (all the museums in Glasgow are free, although I think the tall ship is privately owned and therefore charges for entry). There's also a museum called Clydebuilt in Renfrew (easy to get to on the bus from Glasgow) which focuses on Glasgow's history as a shipbuilding city.

For cars and planes, there's the RAF museum at Hendon in northwest London. It's free entry and although it's quite well known I'd hardly say it's a ""must see"" tourist attraction so is unlikely to ever be too packed.

Brooklands in Surrey has a huge number of planes and land vehicles permanently on display, including a Concorde that's still in very good condition. It's not cheap to get in but you can easily spend a whole day there.

There's also Duxford up on the Cambs/Essex border, you'd need to get a train to Cambridge and then a bus to Duxford itself, but its one of the best air museums in the country.

Finally here's two that really are not well known at all. The Shuttleworth Collection at Old Warden airfield in Beds has some of the oldest still-airworthy aircraft in existence -- if you turn up on one of their air show days you might have the opportunity to see planes that are over 100 years old flying, as long as the weather's suitable (wind over about 6 or 7 knots will ground them). Turning up on non-show days will get you a good close-up look around the collection. Sadly it's a bit out of the way if you don't have a car.

And last but definitely not least, the old De Havilland factory near St Albans is now a museum run by volunteers, many of them ex-RAF, who are slowly but surely restoring all sorts of aircraft from Mosquitos to Comets, and you're encouraged to get up close and personal with nearly all their aircraft.

&gt;

&gt;__Wernher Magnus Maximilian, Freiherr von Braun__ (March 23, 1912 â June 16, 1977) was a [German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany) [rocket engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_engineering) and [space architect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_architecture). He was one of the leading figures in the development of rocket technology in Germany during World War II and, subsequently, in the United States. He is credited as being the ""Father of Rocket Science"".

&gt;In his 20s and early 30s, von Braun was the central figure in the Nazis' rocket development program, responsible for the design and realization of the [V-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-2_rocket) combat rocket during World War II. After the war, he and some select members of his rocket team were taken to the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) as part of the then-secret [Operation Paperclip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip). Von Braun worked on the [United States Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army) [intermediate range ballistic missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_range_ballistic_missile) (IRBM) program before his group was assimilated by [NASA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA). Under NASA, he served as director of the newly formed [Marshall Space Flight Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Space_Flight_Center) and as the chief architect of the [Saturn V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V) launch vehicle, the superbooster that propelled the [Apollo spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_spacecraft) to the Moon.  According to one NASA source, he is ""without doubt, the greatest rocket scientist in history"".  His crowning achievement was to lead the development of the [Saturn V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_V) booster rocket that helped land the first men on the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon) in July 1969.  In 1975 he received the [National Medal of Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Medal_of_Science).

&gt; I have come to the conclusion that you are an idiot. You just flat out don't know what you are talking about. Go play FIFA

This is not a personal dig? 

&gt; I don't know if I was defending it as much as I was noting that it is not as bad as you are making it seem.

If it isnt all that bad, where are the top players we were linked with? Where are the successes of the transfer market? Where is the world class quality?

&gt; That is just semantics. One might say it is missing out on targets and another that it is not overpaying.

Taking the easy way out now? Alright, if that's just your opinion, fair. The proof that we have failed time and time again to land our prime targets is there for all to see. 

&gt; I think you are making a bigger deal out of that then need be. The situation is different this year. 

I am no one to make a big deal or otherwise. It isnt going to affect the club in the slightest way. But, the fact that we miss out on top players every time is frustrating as a supporter.

&gt; There is a world cup right in the middle of the transfer season and this year we have a lot more to offer. Comparing it to us not overpaying other windows is dishonest.

What's the dishonesty? That we miss out targets every-time? Granted it's a world cup year, but we already had a chance to wrap up Lallana and Moreno. What did we do? Get dragged into the mess Southhampton have made. And not accept payment terms of Seville. If we have the money and will anyway pay it, why let a prime target slip by? If we think Moreno is a good player, which our bid does show, why then dont we compromise a bit and bring in top quality?

&gt; I think it goes to show how all those players we ""missed out on"" were not as necessary as you are making them seem.

I think among all your posts and arguments, this is the most stupid one. We dont need world class players?!? Ok, Sir. Ok. 

&gt; Ummmm. I am being realistic. I am accepting the transfer policy, rather saying we are a joke because of it. I am not biased to the policy. I am just calling a spade a spade; we refuse to overplay. Calling not getting a player because of that policy is kind of a misnomer. Hard to accept it as a shortcoming when it does not fit the policy.

You're free to accept. I'm free to argue. The weight in my argument is the failed dealings time after time for any reason.

&gt; So tired of this sentiment. You are inferring way too much. 

I am not inferring anything. Ayre has been at the club long enough and has failed more times that not at closing deals.

&gt; You don't know as much as you think you do about the inner wokrings of LFC, so saying that he is useless is unfounded at best.

You know about the inner workings? Kindly fill me in with some proof if so. I'm going by what I see as a supporter, that is failed dealings time after time.

But let us not forget that the US also takes protection of its citizens very seriously.  Both the EU and the US are committed to high levels of protection for our citizens, but we go about it in different ways.  The EU sometimes relies more on regulations, the US more on litigation.  Both approaches can be effective, but neither is perfect.  There is room to learn from each other.

There will be no compromise whatsoever on safety, consumer protection or the environment.

&gt;The episode was a real deal breaker nearly forcing The Doctor at the time, David Tennant, to regenerate, but the Timelord refused to give in and in the end managed to cremate The Masterâs body on a funeral pyre, but not all of him was burnedâ¦.

I guess people that don't know or care about using drugs safely, a lack of proper drug education/regulation causes these things to happen. I don't mean only the customers, a lot of dealers don't have a clue nor care about how their customers should use their products.

Most people I know that have had a shitty time on ketamine or other dissociatives have done so because they mixed it with alcohol. Unfortunately alcohols effects makes these kinds of decisions all the more likely.

Anyone that took the time to look into harm reduction would know not to mix alcohol with ketamine, but thats not usually what most 15 year olds do.

true,Monkeyboogaloo,null,null,"I agree that fibre to the home is preferable but the reality is BT will not replace the last part of the local loop as the cost would be ridiculous.  Copper can deliver high speeds, and does, but you are right rolling it out across the country as a stable service, giving the majority of people very high speeds is a nightmare. Whether 70s aluminium or crappy water filled ducts it all causes headaches but the reality is that's the way it will stay for a while longer.
My 5:1 contention was with a business ISP who unbundled the local loop. I was in Kentish Town so not a massively busy exchange for business.  But moving to 5:1 512k was a revelation after using dial up for years. 
In the 80s I worked on a few projects that exposed me to what was to come. The first was a US military thing and I used to send CAD drawings across to the states as data rather than couriering a disc. I worked on a feasibility study for a telecoms and data network which through its various incarnations became the backbone for Sky's internet services. And I worked transforming the old chart return system, when people wrote down what records they sold to a digital system with bar codes and a dial up modern in each chart return shop. The last one was my dad's project and I was still at school. My part, with my brothers, was to standardise all the major record labels catalogues listings into a regular format that would be recognised centrally.  I was fascinated by him having to build a data centre and link the sites together, every day stuff now.  I did a similar project later as an apprentice in a large firm, digitising paper stock systems. 
So that's why I say I'm always pleasantly surprised with where we are today. I've been involved for 30 years in the changes if tech especially around comms, mobility and data.  If we had state owned telecoms we could roll out fibre to the home but as a private company it makes no commercial sense for BT to incur the cost for a commodity service.

In case anyone was wondering what ""healthy lives"" is and why we do so badly, it is covered in slightly more detail in the Independent [article](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/uks-healthcare-ranked-the-best-out-of-11-western-countries-with-us-coming-last-9542833.html) about the same thing.

&gt;Britain slips up marginally on its âtimeliness of careâ and **ranks a shocking second to last for the âhealthy livesâ indicator, which had looked at life expectancy, infant mortality and death rates for conditions treatable with medical care.**

How can it be the 'best' healthcare system with such poor outcomes? How is it even efficient for the country if people die or become disabled and stop working and paying taxes? We should be very, very concerned about this, not complacently going on about how amazing the NHS is while it disintegrates in front of us and people suffer needlessly.

I don't want it to be privatised like the US, I want it to be fixed. I received such poor treatment that my health has been permanently damaged and I've ended up having to leave the country. We need to talk about the very real problems with the NHS instead of just shouting down even legitimate criticism. And maybe the only way to fix outcomes is to move to a system more like Australia, Norway, Germany or France - there are more options than 'the NHS as it is' and 'the US'.

true,showmethefever,flair8,,"Paulinho has been solid. Not really making any mistakes, but not being fantastic. He looks comfortable on the ball and has covered a lot of the pitch. He could be a bit better in the attacking third though.

Vertonghen is obviously not a LB and I'm not sure if he's there because they don't have anybody else or if Van Buyten offers more at CB. I think that if they a had a true LB, Vertonghen should be moved into his natural position because a partnership of him and Kompany would be incredible. The penalty he conceded was fucking stupid though, because that attack was never going to amount to anything anyways.

Dembele played really well when nobody on Belgium was playing at all. He got the ball, moved it forward and ran around a lot. He needed a creative player in front of him though, because he and Witsel were doing well holding onto possession, but weren't creating much. 

Chadli caught a lot of shit over on /r/soccer today, but that was fucking stupid. Hazard, Lukaku and De Bruyne were literally invisible for almost all of the first half. Chadli wasn't fantastic by any means, but he was at least trying to make something happen. 

Bentaleb was largely invisible, but only because of Algeria's strategy. If they set out to attack, he would have had a much bigger impact on the match. Him and Dembele were literally fighting for a place next season though haha.

Lloris didn't have to do anything. He's still the best keeper in the world though, so even if he had to do anything, it wouldn't have mattered. 

Assou-Ekotto had a classic match for him.

  Edit, I had another search about on the font of all things statistically inclined, the ONS who also noted the low birth rates in the 60s and 70s which they attributed to women ""who postponed childbearing in their twenties âcatching upâ in their thirties and forties"" and for the higher death rates are attributed to ""a likely consequence of influenza epidemics and cold winters"".  
  
  The excess mortality rates PDF can be downloaded here: [Link] (http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/subnational-health2/excess-winter-mortality-in-england-and-wales/2010-11--provisional--and-2009-10--final-/stb-ewm-2010-11.html#tab-Summary)
    
  While the full births and deaths PDF (I lifed the above quotes from the summary from this) can be downloaded here: [Link] (http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/vsob1/death-reg-sum-tables/2011--final-/sb-births-and-deaths-in-england-and-wales--2011--final-.html#tab-Key-trends-in-births-and-deaths--numbers-and-rates-)

I have no idealogical view in regards to how the NHS is run, unlike others who believe that it being fully state run is the only answer. I just want the best results, if it turns out that private tenders can improve results, then we should use them where appropriate as long as it stays free at the point of use.  

The reality is that the NHS is creaking and will struggle despite what any government is able to do, due to medical  inflation being higher than we can afford to currently spend/ increase spending and a massively ageing population. 

If we are to be realistic and overcome this, we need to admit a few things, firstly the NHS will need to change drastically to cope in the future. Personally, my opinion is that technology will be the driving force of efficiencies needed and the private sector generally has a better track record of bringing in technology to drive efficiency and improve results.  

The second is that in the short term at least it will either need more money or people will have to go without. We can either continue ploughing money into it like Labour did and continually increase taxes until we are bankrupt and have no NHS or we look to Europe and other developed nations and try and find other solutions that work.

When you first sign up with Kelly or Reed or whoever, you take tests to see if you can type at a reasonable speed and use basic office software. The agency will then recommend you to the employer and the employer will try you out before taking you on permanently.

Employers like this system because it means that they don't waste time and money on recruitment and can let you go easily if you turn out to be shit. Agencies like it because they take a cut of whatever the employer is paying you. (You never see this happen. The money the agency advertises for the role is the money you receive. The agency's cut gets paid to them separately and you don't usually even know how much it is.) Employees like it because you can submit your CV to two or three agencies and it will be seen by a whole bunch of potential employers.

The downside to this system is that you don't have any security. So long as you're a temp, they can let you go pretty much at any time for any reason. You don't get annual leave or other basic employee benefits. Also, some employers will never bother to give you a real contract, because it works out cheaper to pay the extra money to the agency and never incur costs for things like pensions or maternity pay.

2) get a phone contract once you're on the electoral roll. Vodafone only checks the roll for instance when credit checking.

3) get a landline. 

Wait 6-12 months

3) apply for a credit builder card (vanquis will take almost anyone).

4) wait for them to increase your credit limit (congratulations, this means you're credit is becoming more profitable for them).

Wait 6-12 months

5) apply and be accepted for some of the better credit cards.

true,Doccykins,null,null,"As other posters are saying you need to break down where your paycheque is going and budget accordingly. I'm only taking what you've said in your OP but if you are getting Â£7.50/hr for 37 hours/wk that should work out as

7.50 * 37 = 277.50 * 52 Â£14,430 gross income, paid monthly should be Â£1202.50/month.

I plugged Â£14,430 into the Salary Calculator and added a conservative 6% pension (you should be on some kind of workplace pension at the very least these days to get a tax relived and employer matched pension but I'm simplifying and overestimating this as I don't know your exact situation)

So your take home should be Â£1,016.31 a month. We'll call this a flat grand to account for anything I may have missed, and if you budget assuming you're getting Â£1,000 a month you can start saving the residual, even if it only seems like a few quid at the time.

With that Â£1,000/mo, Â£375 is going on rent. For two people this isn't too bad. You can try asking your landlord for a freeze at the end of the current tenancy period but 33-40% of take home is well within general renting percentages for our generation (Some posters may disagree, but this is my experience in London)

How much is going towards utility bills (electric, water, council tax, phone, internet, insurance) -- If either/both of you are paying more than Â£20/mo for your phone contracts get them down to a SIM only plan asap. If you have separate mobile phone insurance to house contents insurance look at merging them into a single plan that covers both of your phones and the house contents.

Is the electric a pre-pay meter or paid monthly? Are there high usage appliances that you run continuously without thinking (full kettle every cup of tea, central heating during the summer, using older style lightbulbs and leaving them on all evening when you're not in a room, bitcoin mining rig etc.) Is it worth checking the market to switch supplier? Same with water/internet -- are you on Fibre when 24Mbps will really do you just fine?

Next is groceries - You can get this down to Â£40/week for two people no problem if you do one full weekly shop, plan your meals and stick to it until you are at least out of debt or finish your apprenticeship

Do you have a car that you just fill up 'whenever'? (will usually account for anything between Â£20-45 per fill depending on your tank) How long is your commute? What about the other car expenses such as tax, insurance, maintenance etc? How do you get to work? Is it a worthy investment into getting a no-frills (literally bottom of the range) bicycle and saving that commute fuel/bus fare every day?

Finally how much do you spend eating out/down the pub/buying a new game/gadget etc? If you don't have a budgeted amount for this it's easy to think 'oh yeah that's just a one time purchase' that ends up being two or three of such every month.

You need to trim as much fat as possible now and save every penny you can for when the baby arrives - it may seem a long way off now but you will suddenly be up against it and feeding/clothing 3 people will be a lot easier if you've become used to only spending Â£900 a month during the pregnancy instead of Â£1000-1100 as you'll have both an 'extra' 100-200 a month and a savings buffer in case you need to go over on initial baby costs.",0,1403087283,null,0,false,0,cialka6,t3_281i00,t1_cialka6,t3_281i00,null,1434291529,1,false,UKPersonalFinance,t5_2wkka,1

This is an old behavioral problem. I think it was in [Thinking Fast Thinking Slow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) they dealt with this kind of thing. An example is that a school nursery was having an issue with parents turning up 30 minutes to an hour late to pick up their children. To curb this they brought in a charge for being late to pick up children. It had the opposite effect. As people thought they were paying for a service they would turn up even later and more people did it because they were paying for it and therefore it is not a punishment or a disincentive but in fact the opposite.

It is like having speeding fines without speeding points. Speeding would become just an expensive thing you can do should you be in a hurry.

Charging Â£10 will just mean people will go to the GP with as many *if not more* minor ailments because they are paying for it and are thus morally justified in taking up the GP's time. The only people this will affect are likely the very poor. 

The elderly will, I assume, not be party to this fee. Which then leaves the system pointless as they constitute, for most surgeries, the vast vast majority of patients along with children, who I assume will not be subject to the fee either.

I can't say how much I spend on electricity, because it keeps jumping up, last month it was ridiculous at Â£120, ridiculous because I don't own a tv, have the heating turned off 24/7 (it's all electric) cook once a day for about 20 minutes, and the water heats up overnight - which may be the source of the bill but the the amount of hot water generated is roughly half volume of a standard bath. No internet. I'd say average utilities /mo should be about Â£200. 


I take the train to work and bus back, on a monthly pass for Â£80. I was thinking of biking it but works roughly 10 miles away, and as previously mentioned I have a soaring metabolism and to put up with biking and everything else I'd need around 4000 calories a day. Might seem excessive but I know my body. Which would again put the prices up for food, and to be honest I don't know if I can be arsed biking 20 miles a day five days a week indefinitely, as a lot of that would be on busy roads which scares me a bit.


No money spent out since I realised that I have no money. I'll definitely take your advice on groceries. I'm quite a healthy person, don't eat chocolate, sweets, crisps, luxury items that can cost a bit, so I've got no expenses there. I'll write down what I eat a week, see if I can buy parts in bulk to save money and buy from other places if needs be.

Here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9B7im8aQjo

Basically, Jamie Oliver gets all the shitty bits of the chicken, mashes it into a paste, sprinkles it in breadcrumbs, and fries those fuckers up into chicken nuggets. Kids watch the whole process, 'ewwing' and 'yukking' at the correct moments. The money shot comes up: 'would you kids eat these chicken nuggets knowing what has gone into them?'

The kids anxiously look at each other for a second or two. One of them puts their hand up, and the others follow suit.

Long story short: the kids don't give a fuck. They'd eat a pair of cow bollocks wrapped in intestinal fluid and served with a side of eyeball if it was presented in a pretty way and tasted like beefburger.

It's the parent's job to help the kids understand why nutrition is important, and explain moderation to them, and lead by example. Thirsty parents - drink water from the tap. Your kids watch *everything* you do, and if you eat shit, and serve shit, the kids will grow up not really knowing any better. Also, they need to be shown consequence. Seeing a bag of sugar doesn't mean anything. Seeing a fatty, or someone with fucked teeth, is probably going to be more effective, but even then there's no guarantee they'll take it on board.

Try to break down the imaginary wall

And if you couldn't be bothered
Well then, my friend, you'll fall

And spend all the rest of your life

In this emergency
