Don't get me wrong, there's probably a lot of shit ones out there, but if there was more consistency in pricing across the board and students were more honest about their confidence levels and ability, people would feel more encouraged to take extra training. It's the 'want' to get out on the open road asap as far as students are concerned (which is perfectly understandable) vs the 'need' to keep a student training cost effective, whilst facing other pressures of running a motorcycle business that will always need addressing. 

Of course safety comes first. But to me, if the DSA tightened up who could run a school, gave a benchmark for a consistent and fair cost, allowed said schools to increase revenue via an ability to examine for Mod 1 (providing the premesis was suitable). People could choose to further their training no matter what age and feel they were getting value for doing so.

However last season we had two strikers that were mobile, pacey and pretty clinical. We didn't replace our strikers with like for like which is one of the problems we have going forward. Gerrard, Coutinho, Hendo and Sterling thrived last season with Suarez and Sturridge allowing them to make passes into space.

Occasionally you'll see those players hit a pass for Lambert or Balotelli that Sturridge or Suarez would have been on the end of. Gerrard had one tonight where he lobbed the ball over the top of the defence into space, expecting Lambert to turn his marker and run onto it like Sturridge would have.

Coutinho loves to play a through ball into space, and he's exceptional at it. Sterling likes to play little one-twos at the edge of the 18 yard box to create space, something easier to do when the striker can take a player on and move him around. We all know what Gerrard can do, and for years he's been playing with predominantly pacey forwards.

Having strikers like the SAS worked to these players strengths last season, hence the comment that with one of the two on the pitch the team sheet was often pretty hard to get wrong.

false,Danibaldi,null,null,"Firstly, on the independence question, I'd say that independence isn't a priority for Plaid right now. What's most important is fixing the Welsh economy, I'm sure you know that our economy is one of the worst in Europe and we have the highest poverty levels in Northern Europe. We do think that giving the Welsh Government enough economic levers to fix the economy is important, but we're not in the same position as Scotland, certainly. I'd recommend looking up what Leanne Wood has said on the subject, she's very sensible on this subject. 

On the language, I have to say that when I read things like that I'm pretty offended. I don't want to guilt-trip you into changing your mind, but I just want you to know that all my family speaks Welsh together, a lot of my friends both at home in Conwy and at university in Cardiff speak Welsh with me. I'm not first language Welsh - I learned it as a second language. But nearly a million people speak it - it's not dying, I promise you. 

But anyway, I do understand where you're coming from. But there are indications that children being bilingual is a benefit to them - most countries in Europe have bilingual education, and I don't think people in Wales only being able to speak English is a good idea. If people can speak any language it improves their chances of picking up another one, and considering the Welsh culture is right here in Wales (if you look for it) it's a lot easier to learn than international languages, at any early age. 

In my opinion, we shouldn't be ""pushing Welsh down people's throats"", though. We should be giving everybody the opportunity to learn it, for free, but the most important thing we need to do to keep the language going is making the country economically viable. Welsh-speaking communities (almost the entirety of north West Wales) are among the poorest in Europe, and people are having to leave to find jobs - we need to give them the choice of staying in Wales. Oh, and according to a recent poll, over 60% of parents in Wales said they want their children to be taught at least some lessons in Welsh. 

Basically - only Plaid Cymru, in my mind, will actually fight for communities and the people of Wales. Completely impartial experts say we're underfunded by Westminster, and that's money that should be going to our schools, hospitals and other public services. Right now, our priority has to be rebalancing the UK's vast wealth so it's more fairly distributed. 

But Plaid is about so much more than that - it's also a party that's values go beyond Wales. We want Wales to be a nation on the world stage, and in the EU. And our values are based on the idea that everyone is equal, regardless of language, race, gender, sexuality, religion, ability, or anything else.

The tactics are not working this season because of a variety of factors (which Rodgers also takes the blame for)--and Rodgers has in fact acted to change that, removing Gerrard from the defensive midfield role and attempting to redesign our system. To me that's not nearly reason to say ""he doesn't know what he's doing and won't ever know.""

Yes there is a lot of pressure on him now, but you don't think that pressure was there last season? The pressure of pushing for the title with a 14-15 (don't remember exact number) unbeaten streak is huge, why do you think Arsenal seem to always collapse under the pressure of the title race? And I'd say he did a decent job with it (that's an understatement) and that warrants my further faith in him.

Yeah he's hod slippy decisions this year, but my faith in the manager runs deeper than half a season of poor form all around for the team, especially when there's lots of other issues at play too.

My first inclination is to say Lacazette or Cabaye would be a priority, providing they were for sale and wanted to move here. A grade A player would be my priority. I think Cabaye would be a massive addition to our team, although could misplace Mason from our 11. Lacazette being the priority because Striker is the position we need reinforcements the most and he's currently lighting up Ligue 1, I expect at least 20m Euros for him which could end up being a great deal and addition to our team. I doubt a player like Schneiderlin or Depay would be leaving mid-season so if that's what we want I think the summer would be when we make a real push for them. As for selling, well, we would just need to raise the funds for a striker to come in. I absolutely think Adebayor needs to go, other than that I don't really have a strong opinion. I believe Lloris, Eriksen, Walker, Lamela, Vertonghen, Mason and Kane are untouchable and shouldn't be sold, everyone else we should be prepared to listen to offers at the very least. In my opinion, I'd make an effort to sell Ade, Paulinho, Kaboul and one of Townsend or Lennon. All dependent on who were bringing in, though. If all we do is buy a striker then I'd like Ade to go and the rest of the team to stay in, if we get a CM who can play and start I'd like to see Paulinho out as well as probably Dembele, as much as it would break my heart. Same goes for Winger and Townsend/Lennon. Those were the three we were looking for. I'd like to see Kaboul go regardless and move Dier into the #3 CB spot.

Fischer from Ajax coz I love an Ajax steal.

We can handle losing a CM considering the depth we have there but if we sell a striker we need to buy one. Who? Bony maybe? But unlikely

false,AluminumFalcon3,lfc12,,"Yeah I agree, I believe a large reason Gerrard has been poor as a deep playmaker is that we aren't able to stretch the field as much, especially because we lack runners up top. So either teams play a higher line with less fear against us, squeezing the play (usually these are more confident teams), or they sit deep against us (something we've seen from weaker sides) to deny space between the lines. Both these factors make the space of play smaller and makes the midfield's job harder; they have to sit deeper to find space, but are then unable be as incisive or influential, **especially** out of fear of losing possession and getting hit on the coutner. 

This is why even if Gerrard plays deep, he's unable to find players in space, either between the lines or in behind the opposition defense. Further, this is why (I think) Coutinho has been poorer this season. He's having a lot more difficulty operating against teams that sit deep or teams that squeeze up and deny him space in midfield. He is unable to receive, turn, look up, and pass, largely due to lack of space, and the chemistry isn't there yet to have a flowing pass-and-move system. 

I don't think the issue is necessarily one striker vs two, as much of this subreddit makes it out to be sometimes. I think it's a lot more like you said, the type of players we've gotten require a different style to get the best out of them. I can't really fault a single person for this for multiple reasons though. We went for a **lot** of players this summer, not just Sanchez, but weren't able to line up a quality replacement for Suarez. Given that situation I think and still believe Balotelli wasn't a bad buy, but it certainly was up in the air if he would be able to hit the ground running. Clearly he hasn't been able to and he's been injured anyway. Not that he's the reason we are performing poorly but he was a bit of a wildcard that could've worked out well. I still think he'll come good in the long run but that's just my opinion.

And it's certainly not just due to our striker situation. Like I said we've been unable to replicate our play last year because our players and our system is not able to find space play into it incisively. Lucas at back gives us some defensive cover but we lose some passing range.  Rodgers has tried playing Allen more in midfield to bring play forward but it doesn't seem to work well if teams crowd the middle. He might try playing Can more to provide a physical presence pulling the ball forward but I think he's afraid of that choice backfiring. Meanwhile Lallana and Coutinho have not been able to offer the same level of creativity--we saw against Sunderland that they are generally stagnant against a side that defends well. 

But in all honesty if I were Rodgers I would work on Lallana and Coutinho, because I think getting our attacking midfield to click would push teams to worry about that and relieve some pressure in other areas of the pitch. Fact is teams really don't have to worry about us being penetrative or incisive in the final third from midfield.

Don't forget when Borini looked good for Sunderland he played on the wing for a side that generally had the lesser share of possession. That's very different from what we are looking for from a striker. Lambert meanwhile had a fantastic number of goals **and** assists for Southampton last season, and had a run of good form for us earlier when he was scoring more than our other strikers or creating chances better.

false,ThatPoeticMotion,null,null,"If you are in favour of playing Gerrard centrally, dropping Allen, and playing Coutinho/Lallana ahead of him I might agree. But most are wet for Gerrard in the advanced role but still wanted Lallana and Coutinho to start.  Explain to me how that one works then? We've seen time and time again *this season* that Coutinho and Lallana have no place in the deeper role. Yes, Coutinho played it well last season but we were also playing to his strengths with plenty of runners and dominating games in general, but this season we can't afford to have Coutinho in a deeper role when we're struggling to get a grip in midfield. I have been consistent saying Lambert shouldn't start so I can say without hindsight that I feel Markovic or Coutinho should have started in place of him. However, I understand Rodgers rationale for Lambert because the team is low on confidence playing a team likely to park the bus and so might struggle to create anything beyond crosses into Lambert. 

I hate that now with hindsight everyone is lamenting Rodgers but if he had played your formation then you'd be doing the exact same thing. He *is* making mistakes, as I've pointed out, but most fans are being extremely fickle and unfair given they don't know what they want either. Moreno should have started over Enrique and Toure should have started over Lovren (*without hindsight* - lovren played well). But the two decisions he's taking the most heat for are ridiculous since everybody is being incredibly hypocritical about them. Everyone is raving about Gerrard in the number 10 role but suddenly he should be played in the midfield with Coutinho in front? (I assume this because for reasons stated it would be idiotic to play Coutinho/Lallana deeper instead) Or are they favouring dropping Gerrard? And it's all well and good saying Lambert is isolated and slow after the fact, but how many people seriously didn't want him included tonight *before* the game? None of the afore mentioned are opinions formed before the game and come aided by hindsight but without any real answer of how they would have done it.. They are not necessarily wrong, or right, but I see very few who have consistently said this before the game.

Fact is the team was nervous today, is devoid of confidence, and they played very poorly as a result. Rodgers takes some blame, and so do the players. It certainly isn't ALL on Rodgers. What a fucking stupid opinion that is. Had Hendo scored that I can guarantee Rodgers wouldn't have been lambasted like he is now. But does he magically control the opposition goalkeeper to stop him saving it because he controls *literally* everything and is responsible for everything wrong at the moment? No.. 

Rodgers has made lots of mistakes this season, but circumstances have also played there part and ultimately there are literally thousands of variables at play that are out of his control..So many wankers willing to do a U-turn based on this alone. So let's ignore his history with Swansea.. With *us* last season.. Fantastic.

Now I'm not saying that Brendan isn't at fault here, but do we always have to blame him for the performance of our players?

false,Helpopotamus,lfc87,,"&gt; I hate that now with hindsight everyone is lamenting Rodgers but if he had played your formation then you'd be doing the exact same thing. He is making mistakes, as I've pointed out, but most fans are being extremely fickle and unfair given they don't know what they want either. 

Just because you've seen some different opinions on here on what people want doesn't mean you can lump each individual into a group. I complained last time we played with 4 central midfielders and we were piss poor that game. Just like this game. 

You act like it's not his fucking job to figure out the best way to make the team work. Fans may be fickle, but they aren't paid 50k a week. Rodgers decisions have been piss poor and it deserves to be criticised playing a massively defensive formation in a fucking must win game. 

Tactically we've been diabolical all season, so don't talk to me about players not working in formations, when 90%of our gameplan revolves around Lovren and Skrtel passing to each other.

If you'd been paying attention to the subs opinion, you might have noticed we've been clamoring for a proper holding mid for a year. And low and behold when we actually start playing one in Lucas, we suddenly stop conceding huge amounts of goals. 

We have great attacking players in Lallana/Sterling/Markovic/Coutinho and only one of them gets consistent minutes and he's just turned 20. With those players, we lose to teams like palace, because we get completely rolled over by any team with an ounce of energy. Dwight Gayle and Yannick Bolasie are not even in our attackers league in terms of quality, but they are much better utilized.

We were overrun by QPR, Ludogorets, Basel, Palace etc this season and you don't think with better management we'd be winning those games?

Bottom line is week after week after week the same mistakes are made. It took him 3 months to realise Gerrard wasn't working in the holding role and teams actually used his defensive frailty was being targeted and exploited by every other team.

In A View From The Bridge, I started writing about how a bridge represents McCarthyism. This is *sort of* what I mean by bullshitting. The chances are that the play was heavily influenced by McCarthyism, but your ordinary reader wouldn't think anything of a bridge representing a political stand point. This presents something you **must** take into consideration when writing your answers for your literature paper: context.

Honestly, I can't stress enough just how important context is within these exams. It's insane, it really is. 

'Mockingbird has a **lot** of context that you can write about, so you're in a great position with this. I was in much the same position with Of Mice &amp; Men, as the context is somewhat related. **AUTHOR CONTEXT IS ALSO IMPORTANT!!!! DON'T JUST LOOK *INSIDE* OF THE STORY!!!!!!**

A vast vocabulary also goes down well. Ykno, it's an English exam. That's probably a given, haha. Try using appropriate terminology also, such as *foil*, or *microcosm*, which is a very good one - in my opinion. Just throw the bastards in wherever you can, but just don't over use them or try to use them if you're not sure they fit. If you don't think they fit in a particular sentence, the ~~probability~~ chances are that it won't (an example shown there).

Shmoop and Spark Notes. Use them. They're fucking brilliant. They tell you the themes and motifs, character analysis, context.. The whole lot. 

An obvious one - but my English teacher said this to me: *Read the fucking book!* You might think you'll be able to wing it by just reading up on the synopsis. Nope. Wrong. So, so **so** wrong.

Quotes. Learn them. I did WJEC, and we weren't allowed a copy of the book in the exam and so we had to learn the fuckers off by memory. Of course, the exam board gave us some leeway if they weren't exactly correct. I'm not sure if Edexcel allow you to have the book with you. You most certainly won't be allowed an annotated version, however. I know that AQA allow books to be used within the exam.

As with every exam - past papers, past papers, past papers, fucking past papers. Learn the exam inside out, learn where the marks are, how the different bands are marked and how to hit the different AOs, and which ones need to be present within certain questions. Don't just look at the top band; you need to see what you need to do to progress from one to the other. A band 6 answer won't be given top marks if there aren't band 4 elements within it. Think of them as the foundation, and the band 6 the turret of the castle.

Mark schemes will help you with learning how to *play the exam*. Similarly, look at the examiner reports. They sound boring, but they tell you what questions candidates found the easiest, and what ones they found hardest - why they found them difficult and then gives reasons why they didn't get the full marks. I mean, c'mon. Isn't that amazing for a candidate going into the exam this year? Make sure to do this **after** completing the past paper mock though, otherwise the entire mock will be pointless.

Feel free to PM me at any time. I seem to spend a lot of time on here, ~~looking at boobies~~ so chances are I'll reply pretty sharpish. Some people have asked for my Kik, if that's easier to talk.

Honestly, the only player injured as of now is Sturridge (please don't tell me Balo was going to be any better). The owners spent 100mp on players that were chosen by Brendan Rodgers, players who were supposed to play his ""way"" of football. But for some reason Rodgers doesn't have the capability or the tactical acumen to adapt to the players around him. 

It took him almost half a season to realize that we need a ""real"" defensive midfielder in Lucas, and his team selection for todays game was absolutely atrocious.

I agree with your points and I'm certainly not defending everything Rodgers has done  *this season*. However, it's ridiculous that all the blame is being heaped on Rodgers for this singular game when his perceived errors he made are only being picked up on because we lost. He made mistakes today, but *many* fans would do well to understand not everything is under his control and the solution isn't *always* as simple as they make it out to be. Even with hindsight. You're right, Rodgers does get paid to do his job. He also has far, far more information, knowledge and expertise at his disposal than your average fan. Do you not think that perhaps there's a reason for many of his changes and that maybe if we set out a team like the majority wanted we'd have other problems, unforeseen by couch epl fans. This sub was also clamouring for two up front but we've seen twice this season that we were absolutely dominated in the midfield playing this formation since we didn't have the players to effectively play it. Rodgers knows that's the way forward when Balo and Sturridge are fit, as he showed against Spurs, but without one (or both) it isn't obvious that it would be as effective. Borini is no Sturridge by any stretch, and Lambert and Balotelli are certainly not a strike partnership that would make *any* sense. 

Whilst Rodgers has made mistakes this season and ultimately deserves criticism, it isn't all his fault given the circumstances he's faced with (any team would struggle without their two best players and 80% of their goals) and the variables at play. The players should be under fire as well as the manager; Rodgers can't control his men and even if he lines them up exactly how he should, they could still play an absolute stinker. And who would *many* fans blame in that instance I wonder?

There's not much I can say/do about you being offended, that's your business, however you should know that just because your family continues to speak Welsh does not mean that numbers of Welsh speakers aren't in decline.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language

Definitely less than a million Welsh speakers and dropping. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying that's a good thing but you have to take the situation as it is.

I'm not saying Welsh shouldn't be an option, it definitely should, but when you have such a bad economy it doesn't help literacy levels to try and teach all kids two languages at the same time. I don't see why it can't be an option like Spanish/German with a proportional amount of welsh medium primary schools. Time that could go towards teaching English/literacy that will be of greater use than Welsh for those without a vested interest in Welsh, it will help the economy more to have people who are better versed in English than Welsh. Also it's a well known problem that there aren't enough Welsh teachers to go around since there are so few that speak it in the first place.

It's worth bearing in mind too that European languages are different to Welsh, English is a Germanic language with a majority of words based on Latin vocabulary. While being bilingual is great for those who can manage it studying European languages complements English to a greater extent than Welsh does and is better from an economic standpoint since you have a greater potential audience to communicate with. Welsh is only used in Wales and Wales is tiny.

From what I've read of Plaid Cymru on other issues I do generally agree with them, I love the millionideas thing and they do seem to be going in the right general direction I just fail to see them ever growing to a point where they'll be able to do much, especially compared to a party that isn't based on one (very small) country.

&gt;__Welsh__ (*Cymraeg* or *y Gymraeg,* pronounced [kəmˈrɑːɨɡ, ə ɡəmˈrɑːɨɡ]) is a member of the [Brittonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittonic_languages) branch of the [Celtic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_languages) spoken natively in [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales), by some along the [Welsh border](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Marches) in [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), and in *[Y Wladfa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Wladfa)* (the Welsh colony in [Chubut Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chubut_Province), [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina)).  Historically it has also been known in English as ""the British tongue"",  ""Cambrian"",  ""Cambric""  and ""Cymric"". 

&gt;The [2011 UK Census](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_UK_Census) counted 3.1 million residents of Wales. Of these, 73% (2.2 million) reported having no Welsh language skills. Of the residents of Wales, 25% of the population are not from the country. Of the residents of Wales aged three and over, 19% (562,000) reported being able to speak Welsh, and 77% of these were able to speak, read, and write the language (making 431,000 - 15% of the total population).  This can be compared with the 2001 Census, in which 20.8% of the population (582,000) reported being able to speak Welsh.  In surveys carried out between 2004 and 2006, 57% (315,000) of Welsh speakers described themselves as fluent in the written language. 

&gt;A greeting in Welsh is one of [55 languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contents_of_the_Voyager_Golden_Record#Greetings) included on the [Voyager Golden Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record) chosen to be representative of Earth in NASA's Voyager program launched in 1977.  The greetings are unique to each language, with the Welsh greeting being *Iechyd da i chwi yn awr ac yn oesoedd*, which translates into English as ""Good health to you now and forever"".  

&gt;The [Welsh Language (Wales) Measure 2011](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Language_Commissioner) gave the Welsh language official status in Wales,  making it the only language that is *de jure* official in any part of the United Kingdom, English being *de facto* official.

&gt;Throughout Wales, roadsigns are bilingual with Welsh and English (e.g. Chepstow is the English name, also given as [Cas-gwent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cas-gwent) which is the Welsh name). The language that appears on the signs first is decided by the local government.

&gt;He's the 5th longest serving manager in the premier league. It's hardly like it's Spurs where they come and go all the time.
We have United, Arsenal, Burnley and Swansea to play then were half way through the season. Given how we've been playing we could be looking at about 24 points half way through. Personally I don't think that's good enough.
&gt;You can blame it on players lost in the summer or injuries. But with the amount we spent on new players and coming off that fantastic last season I don't think it's anywhere near acceptable.
&gt;We shouldn't fall apart because we don't have one player to rely on to save us.
&gt;Even Rodgers first season with us we finished 7th with 60-something points. The second half of this season needs to be a lot, lot better for Rodgers to be redeemed, because at this rate were looking at a finish near or even in the bottom half of the table.
8th place would be absolute minimum for me. I don't want to finish any lower than that and let Rodgers give us our lowest ever premier league finish.

Of course changing manager half way through is going to be a massive shake up and will possibly result in less points than we would have had sticking with Rodgers. 

But he looks like he has no idea what to do. Most importantly for me personally is I want to see Liverpool playing attractive football again like last season. Every game is more frustrating than the last at minute. I don't see many people disagreeing with me that playing one up front while we pass it around the back 4 isn't fucking infuriating.

It might not help in the short run, but we might continue like this if we don't. And I'd rather see him go now than have another poor second half of the season, then spend the first few months of next season adjusting to a new manager if he goes in the summer.

 I think it's highly concerning to see SO MANY resemblances to his Reading spell, this season. I am also sick of hearing him saying that we play well when we're playing awful. He's painting 0-0 AT HOME against Sunderland a good result, absolutely laughable...

Edit: I'm not calling for his head yet though, just to make that clear. I'm calling for his honesty regarding some of the results. He can't keep protecting atrocious football! We've won a few now, but we're still awful for 80% of the games. The last time we were good was against Spurs, ages ago. Managers need results, and Brendan is no different.

If he's smart at all it's as a football manager. The guy says the same amount of dumb things every coach I've ever had has said. And I'm not talking about when he's managing the media, etc, etc. I'm saying he's just not a smart man.

As a football manager I think he does have a vision. His vision is undoubtedly a positive one. He's in a rare position of managing a legend who is arguably holding back the team at this point. He's in a position of being one of the few managers in European football who has no quality striker at his disposal. He plays to win and when we don't we usually look awful. 

No matter what anyone says, Suarez was more of the reason we played the way we did last season than Rodgers. I don't mean that in terms of goals or assists or the fear he put into other teams, although all those things helped. He dictated a tempo and an energy from his own players. We haven't pressed the shit out of anyone this year. We haven't dominated anyone. For us, last year, our ability to do that started at the front. He put every clubs back line under pressure and we benefited tremendously from his work ethic.

To answer your simple question:

Right now I think, no matter who's in charge, there's a lack of quality. If we're firing Rodgers it would, IMO, be because of his horrendous transfer dealings and his refusal (until recently) to adjust the side in a way to get us closer to winning right now. 

Ultimately, you can argue that a manager doesn't have the players available to achieve his vision and that he wasn't given the money to bring them in. I'm not sure, this season, if we can argue that for Rodgers. We're at this point where I think he has no right to feel comfortable in his position, but I also think his removal would demand us to answer what our next move is and, as you say, it's hard to see what that would be.

If you look at the table right now, we should absolutely, with the talent at our disposal, be able to secure the 4th CL slot. It doesn't mean we will but we can and we should. If Rodgers can't get us that I think we have to ask what it means for the next 1-2 years after.

He wasn't the first choice, but what good is it to say that he was a last resort? Is he really trying to motivate a player that way? He's already a Liverpool player, why would he single him out when none of the signing are actually playing well? (Lallana not included).

Second time around, I was phoning the insurance the day after claiming a full repayment, as it was summer (I can take public transport in winter, but summer, no way, jose). They paid up within two weeks. The bike showed up later, apparently intact again, but told the police it wasn't mine any more, it was the insurance's now. I highly recommend this last approach: quick and clean with minimum hassle and worry. 

Now I've got another third party, fire &amp; theft insurance (Lexham), which turns out is around £8/month cheaper (!). Downside is the £600 (compulsory) excess. Upside, forking £45 more your excess comes down to £100 (!!). It's like you're betting £45 with them that your bike won't be stolen, but compared to the £500 I would have to pay if that happened, and given my previous records, it was a sure win (the motherfffffsss! know when to squeeze you)

Read your policy, specially the clauses that affect the way you use your bike everyday (locks, etc.; the habit of **always** locking your bike with an U-lock might mean the difference between been bought a new ride and having to buy another one yourself), where your insurance applies exactly (turns out some don't apply if you park more than X miles away from your place), etc. Read it.

Dybala from Palermo looks great, I fear that he could be another Lamela type situation but the fact that he's a striker makes me feel a bit more secure in the sense that he'll be focused more on scoring goals rather than attempting the crazy shot or trick and cut inside (looking at you Lamela).

I wouldn't recommend living in Carrickfergus, maybe check out housing like others have suggested in the South Belfast area (Lisburn road, Ormeau road, Ravenhill Road, Stranmillis, Malone Road) as theres a lot of different nationalities in these areas and also quite safe. Were as Carrickfergus is a predominantly loyalist area and although I'm sure you would be safe I feel that south Belfast area is a much better area and especially for foreigners.   Also depending on traffic u can get into Belfast city centre in 15-20mins. Also your fine walking anywhere as long as you aren't wearing anything like a Celtic/Rangers/NI/ROI/GAA jersey in certain areas.

Brendan hasnt become a bad manager overnight. Yes some of his signings havent worked out yet, but even the world class managers dont get every signing 100% correct. I believe Moreno will be our left back for the next 7-8 years. Markovic will develop into a world class attacker. Lambert/Balotelli are short term solutions to a deeper issue. Lallana adds depth to the squad. Can looks promising if not a little raw.

Lazar's the silver lining for the end of the CL this season, if he gets a lot better or if the form of the team drops as a whole, he may become the silver lining of this whole season if we can hold on to him until the team can regrow any of the teeth Luis took with him (that wasn't meant to be a biting pun and I'm sorry).

For me, right now, Lucas is the only one essential in our midfield.  Can and Lallana are hardly getting the look in they should be given how poor we've been.  They could really help change things.  I think if you put Lucas and Can in the middle together they'll be a hell of a matchup for opposing midfields to try and play through.  Lucas stays more reserved while Can has some license to get about a bit (Fernandinho/Yaya type of relationship), and then you've got your pick of Gerrard/Coutinho/Lallana/Henderson/Markovic/Sterling/Suso to play in front of them.  Similarly, when he's on form, Lucas sitting in with Henderson is a great option, Hendo gets the freedom he needs to impact things without being limited to one side of the pitch this way.  He's intelligent enough, and has the engine, to really get all over the pitch if we let him.

Allen is phenomenal for the games we need to control and slow down.  He's amazing as a sub for a game we need to kill off, or for a game we need to take a more cautious approach in.

That being said.  How do you feel about your managers tactics this season.  It's been a radical change from last year.  Do you all feel he will last the year or next summer? I don't know much about your managerial  history/ how you deal with it. I know we like to hold on for way to long...  I think we have had...  18 managers in 128 years

That being said...  We have our own issues.  A manager to big to be fired or a board to scared to do anything...  And our damn American owners who only seen to want money (... Im an American whaaa). Iv loved Wenger for a long time but truly believe we need to hit the restart button.

&gt;CJ381 Recognising the nature of the female prison population, with high levels of mental illness, experience of being a victim of crimes such as sexual assault and domestic violence, and caring responsibilities for children, the only women who should be in custody are those very few that commit serious and violent crimes and who present a threat to the public.

That's right.. Women will only go to prison if they're violent. 

&gt;EC658 We will gradually establish legal ways for companies to be transformed into mutual organisations, such as consumer or worker cooperatives in specified circumstances if a sufficient majority of the relevant workers or customers agree. Existing shares will be converted into non-voting equity or loan stock. One important initial circumstance when this might be done is upon the sale of a small business or upon the death or retirement of the owner. Another initial application might be to football or other sporting clubs where a majority of the season ticket holders, supported by the wider local community, might want to bring a local club into mutual ownership. In the longer run we would envisage some process of this kind applying, with appropriate safeguards, to all companies.

Hi, is that investment of any kind? Yeah, I'm afraid the UK is closed for business. Please invest in literally any other country. Best of luck, Comrade!

&gt;EN261 We will cancel construction of new nuclear stations and nuclear power will not be eligible for government subsidy; the Green Party opposes all nuclear power generation and is particularly opposed to the construction of new nuclear power stations, electricity from which is likely to be significantly more expensive per unit supplied than other low-carbon energy sources, and too slow to deploy to meet our pressing energy needs. Cancellation will avoid the costs and dangers of nuclear energy and waste being passed on to future generations long after any benefits have been exhausted.

Good news, as long as the wind blows we can turn on the oven! 

&gt;HO504 All new house building and change of use should be subject to open democratic planning approval. For larger schemes and all proposed developments on green field sites, this will require independent comprehensive environmental impact assessments.

The NIMBY's just creamed their pants over this. It pretty much invalidates every other housing policy they have because home owners will always vote to limit supply in their area. Standard political naivety from a party that's never been in power. 

&gt;MG205 Migration policies should not discriminate directly on grounds of race, colour, religion, political belief, disability, sex or sexual orientation. Preference should not be given to those with resources or desirable skills.

So, essentially that means let whoever in. You're not allowed to judge them on anything..

&gt;PD302 On inspection, there is little or no threat of direct invasion of the UK by any nation. Commitment to a large standing army, a navy of large warships around our coastline, squadrons of fighter planes and a cripplingly expensive missile defence system is therefore unnecessary. **Any threat of invasion that might arise in the future is so remote that realignment of the UK military and defence preparations would be possible long before any invasion occurred.**

Anyone should be able to see how stupid an idea that is. Our aircraft carriers are taking ~6 years to build. War can build and happen in that time frame quite easily. And with China and India rising to superpower status, with natural enemies Japan and Pakistan.. There's really no way to know what will be needed in the future. Better to have an army and not need it than not have one and need it. 

&gt;PD312 The Green Party is committed to the early conversion of economic, scientific and technological resources presently used to support the arms race, to socially useful and productive ends. Some military training areas should be decommissioned and used as nature reserves, with suitable provision for access by the public.

Wait, so we're meant to quickly ramp up war production even though our war industry would be dismantled.. Sound logic as always. 

&gt;RA407 Women who have experienced rape, sexual violence and forms of torture will not be detained. If an individual raises these experiences at any point in her asylum claim, she will be released to continue her case in the community.

No at all exploitable..

&gt;RA408 There will be no male staff employed in roles where they come into contact with women detainees at Yarl’s Wood Immigration Removal Centre.

All men are untrustworthy rapists. How fun. 

&gt;TR303 Speed limits and regulations which are not implemented are ineffective. All speed limits would be rigorously enforced, as would any other regulations relating to drivers of vehicles (including public transport). Greater use will be made of automatic cameras and other speed measurement.

However, I can also justify the red card under another rule:

What the ref sees:

Markovic looks up and behind and sees his opponent, two times. Then he throws his arm out in a completely unnatural height, straight into the opponent's face. Potentially he could have poked his eye out (granted, there wasn't near enough contact for that, but the risk is still there, given that you have two players moving at speed). This then qualifies as Serious Foul Play and Excessive Use of Force (page 63 in the pdf you linked).

*""Using excessive force"" means that the player has far exceeded the necessary use of force and is in danger of injuring his opponent*

There is no need for Markovic to have his hand in the other guy's face, and the way he throws his arms out means there is serious risk of injury.

- Moreno i agree, looks like a wonderful LB

- Markovic I hope turns out well but we will have to see, he isn't going to become world class sitting on the bench 

- Lambert/Balotelli situation:  Completely agree, its a short term solution to a deeper issue, even though I think Mario will succeed here, but was a short term solution worth 20m pounds? Both of which are worse right now than Borini who Rodgers won't even put on the bench

- Lovren, no idea what to think about him but his management of Sakho isn't encouraging also, thats 2 CBs equating over 35m pounds that Rodgers can't get the best out of and has been inconsistent in giving them playing time to form a partnership 

- Can: completely agree, could become insane, but once again needs playing time, he's miles better than Joe Allen but Rodgers gets a hard on for the welsh xavi 

-  Lallana, I love Adam, looks quality, very two footed and could become a real asset, but you say he adds depth....we can't afford to have 25m pound depth/bench players

But where is the evidence that teaching two languages somehow harms literacy? The scientific literature, in fact, seems to point to the exact opposite; that bi- or multilingualism have extensive positive effects on both mind and brain. [Here's an early example](http://www.psycontent.com/content/8p78271408085j96/); a 1962 paper on the relationship between bilingualism and intelligence (the conclusions of which suggested a positive relationship). [Here's a much more recent study](http://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/abstract/S1364-6613(12\)00056-3?cc=y), which found evidence to suggest that bilingualism helps to protect against cognitive decline in old age. [This study](http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FPBR.16.4.705) suggested that bilinguals have an advantage in learning new languages over monoglots, while [this one](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811904005853) found that bilinguals performed better in certain cognitive tasks than monolinguals. 

The idea that learning Welsh will somehow hold kids back from learning English at the same time is, as far as I can see, a load of old rubbish. I went to a Welsh medium school. I had no trouble in picking up both languages, and my English certainly hasn't suffered on account of my Welsh education. 

Remember that multilingualism is the norm, not the exception. Multilingual people outnumber monolinguals worldwide. I'd argue that we should by assigning *more* time to language classes, not less. I'd like to see kids of primary school age learning a foreign language alongside both Welsh and English.

The case at hand here is not about journalists being detained, or snooping charters. It's about three men, with clear links to terrorist activity being removed of their British citizenship. Again, they were not made stateless, it was clearly stated that one of the reasons this action was taken was that they had Pakistani citizenship, which is also where they have resided for a number of years.

Clearly there are certain groups and individuals within, and outside of this country who make a concerted effort to carry out attacks. It cannot be denied that certain measures need to be implemented to prevent those. I also am an ardent supported of civil liberties and, as I stated in my original comment, it's a worrying precedent. 

I think a healthy degree of skepticism is the best solution.

Well, when you build your tactics around two strikers, and then no longer have them available the following season, your tactics will inevitably change. Even setting aside Sturridge's goals and quality, he makes a big difference to how we play from a tactical standpoint.

&gt; Do you all feel he will last the year or next summer?

I expect us to improve as the season progresses - in each of Rodgers' seasons, we've been better in the second half than the first - and having Sturridge back will help as well.  So I see no reason to sack him mid-season, especially given the lack of outstanding replacements.

I'd give him next season as well. For me, there's bigger problems than Rodgers, namely with the 'transfer committee' system that has been far too unsuccessful to tolerate. Changing the manager without changing the transfer committee will not lead to consistent improvement.

&gt; I don't know much about your managerial history/ how you deal with it.

How the club have historically dealt with managers is irrelevant, really; it depends on the owners. FSG are quick to remove managers if they feel they haven't delivered on expectations. I'm not sure how they'd react to Rodgers finishing outside of the top 4 this season - after all, he did achieve it one season early last time round. As I said above, I hope they don't sack him, but fix the transfer process instead.

He started Enrique because he has more experience and was cautious of the mistakes moreno has made through the season - it didn't work. Enrique wasn't effective going forward (which is important for us as Rodgers wants his full backs attacking) and was giving away passes, so he brought on Moreno. 

Lambert came off because he couldn't get into the game at all. He was very ineffective and maybe all these recent games caught up to him. - Sterling goes up top, rotating with gerrard. People here have been calling for sterling to have a go up top and now they have their wish. I don't think Borini would've offered anything extra up there either. 

Markovic on to add some much needed pace. He was very very bright. 

I think everyone would be singing a different tune if it weren't for the red card. I think we would've won. Everyone would be singing Rodgers name for those subs!

We had spent £3.8 billion, and development work was still ongoing,  for what would have been a fleet of 9 aircraft.

Costs were spiralling out of control - the entire program had originally been planned to cost £500 million for 21 aircraft, and here we were having spent almost 8x as much for less than half as many aircraft, with work still very far from complete.

And the mr4a aircraft would have been rebuilt 1950s aircraft, with each plane slightly different from the others (because they were originally handmade), causing further problems with spares etc.

We should have a maritime patrol aircraft but nimrod mr4a was not it.

He had one job this summer: replace Luis Suarez. When Alexis Sanchez fell through he, the committee or both panicked and bought a series of players who may one day be excellent, like Markovic, and other utter donkeys, like Balotelli and Lovren. 

He doesn't know his best team, the squad additions and drops are totally arbitrary and there has been zero sign of improvement as the weeks go by. £100m was spent this summer and there was £95m worth of talent sat on the bench doing fuck all today. We went into a must win Champions League game with a defensive setup, the *absolute* worst back 4 available and no fucking striker backing up a 32 year old, immobile striker who less than 4 years ago was playing in the Championship. That is totally inexcusable and all rests at Rodgers' feet. 

I don't know what his problem is. I don't know if Suarez leaving broke him, or if the SAS last season forced his hand into a highly successful tactical setup by nature of their play but regardless I think he's run his race at the club.

The totality of the evidence shows we will not make the top 4, we will not win the Europa League and Rodgers will absolutely not be able to attract top quality players in the transfer market.

false,Sehs,null,null,"I think I'm in a ""unique"" position in that I follow two teams very passionately. Liverpool FC and the Montreal Canadiens. They also share similarities in that for the longest time they were the most successful teams in their leagues.

Both coaches have had their issues. For example, in this game, Rodgers started the 4-2-3-1 with two ""defensive"" midfielders in Lucas and Allen. Only having Lambert as an attacking option in a must-win game seems a bit odd. Even if he doesn't trust Borini at all.

Similarly, starting the slower but more experienced Johnson and Enrique over Manquillo and Moreno, who you can argue offer more going forward, was a bit puzzling. Moreso in the case of Enrique. I think Johnson had a relatively decent game but we may have benefited more from having a younger and faster Manquillo playing.

In the same vein, the Montreal Canadiens have acquired a couple of extra defenceman this season who have been starting lots of game in place of younger players that have more potential. The conclusion I've come to is that coaches/managers by nature seem to be a very stubborn bunch. They tend to prefer the good veterans with experience as opposed to the youngsters who are prone to make mistakes.

However, it's becoming apparent, in both cases for me, that the risks of the younger players outweigh the potential benefits of the veterans. These veterans are making the same quantity if not more mistakes than the youngsters. Moreover, they don't offer the same speed or creativity as the younger guys do.

A lot of times, the coaches are so stubborn that they're only forced to change their ways due to injuries. They happen in all sports and sometimes they are a blessing in disguise. I think a majority of us will agree that the starting lineup today was not ideal. It was very defensive.

In the cases of both Montreal and Liverpool, some people are calling for the coach's head. Michel Therrien, the Canadiens head coach was fired from his previous gig with Pittsburgh one season after he took the team to the Stanley Cup Finals. The Penguins would go on to win the Stanley Cup that year.

I'm not saying that we should fire Rodgers. He clearly knows enough that he was able to get us to 2nd last season. Granted we had Suarez and a healthy Sturridge last year. I think the important thing is for the manager to realize that certain things aren't working and to make the necessary changes to right the ship.

So far, Rodgers hasn't really showed that too much. Obviously, it's a bit difficult now with Suarez gone to Spain and Sturridge and Balotelli both injured. I honestly think that Balotelli with our current team would do better than he did a month ago.

Without saying that his time is limited, Rodgers really needs to make some adjustments if he wants to continue to be the manager at Liverpool. Yes he got us to 2nd last year but the team has shown very little signs of progression this season. It's a bit disturbing that we played better in the second half today against Basel, when we were one man down, than the entire first half. Like, it's a must win game, why are you coming out with this lineup? It offers very little going forward and very little in terms of creativity. 

I was actually surprised that he brought on Markovic. Honestly, it looked like an excellent addition up until his red card. We can go on about ""what ifs"" but unfortunately, we didn't start witn that lineup and we ended up not getting the result we desired. We have some big games coming up in the rest of December and I think these will play a big factor in Rodgers' future at the club.

Look, I'm all for stability and I tend to stick with the coach more than most. That being said, something's gotta give. We need to show improvement. I don't care that we have so many injuries, you're the manager, deal with it. It's your job. We should still be able to produce results against the likes of Palace and Sunderland.

So overall, I don't think it's necessarily time to panic quite yet, but it's getting pretty damn close. Obviously, we'd all love to have Sturridge back, but it's the inspiration and combativeness of the team that has been lacking. Most of us don't really expect to score any goals nowadays. How fucking depressing is that. We all watch the games, we can all see when nothing is working.

false,ThatPoeticMotion,null,null,"From what I can gather you're describing the sunk cost principle and querying whether we should be starting players just because of their price tag. You seem to have partially answered your own question yourself but I'll give my thoughts too. 

In accordance with the sunk cost principle, players certainly should not be started *just* by virtue of their price. However, it just isn't this simple. The price of a player actually does have a strong correlation with their ability to perform at this moment in time, with the exception of youth. There is a reason they are valued at the price they are and whilst we can vouch, as Liverpool fans, that this does not *necessarily* preclude that the player is good, it certainly gives a strong indication of their respective talent. Even still, it would be unwise to judge a player purely based on price-tag, and this doesn't alone justify their selection *for that specific game*. It might, however, be logical to pick a player with a high price tag for games in the hope that he reaches his potential (assuming playing time at a high level is the best opportunity for this). This is a controversial and risky strategy since it is widely believed you should, at least in relatively important games, field your best eleven *at that moment in time*. So, as a manager, you'd have to assess at what point you expect this player to reach a level at which he has truly 'earned' his position and if this strategy would make sense given the potential short-term losses and future gain. This is massively over-simplified but, to be clear, it could range from the manager seeing the player as one who could come good *that game*, due to his obvious perceived potential, or into the future. 

So, in my opinion, that would be the only rational argument for starting a player who hasn't warranted inclusion beyond his price-tag. Then, of course, you have political reasons for inclusion or self-serving reasons (from manager perspective). An political example, some would argue (although I disagree) would be Rodgers playing Gerrard to appease supporters/the team, and a self-serving example would be Rodgers playing  Lovren in an attempt to justify his own purchase. Both are rational, in some respects, for the manager but not for the good of the team.

I would posit two points, aimed more in general than at your own points. 

1) I'm not sure that we, as a 'unified' sub (if such an entity is even a thing), can justify calling Rodgers out on not including certain players on account of their price-tag, when we also simultaneously call for the inclusion of Toure, Gerrard and Lucas. Obviously it isn't so simple- these men will ultimately be short term fixes, they are ageing and not going to last as long as other team members. Also, those calling for Toure's inclusion may well not be those criticising Lallana's exclusion- we are a massive sub!

2) I think what I'm hoping for is a more nuanced dialogue on why we aren't picking players- lets look at what they offer for todays match rather than how much they cost us.

I think my problem comes down to price tag being a very easy way to justify someones inclusion. Lets take today as a hypothetical case study- if someone said 'Lallana would have changed the game, he did cost us £25m!', is that because we expect so much because of his price tag? Or do we genuinely believe it would have all changed? Its very easy to speculate on what would have happened. Borini instead of Lambert was being called for during and after the match- in reality I can't see him making any real difference.

The team is in a difficult place. Let's try and move on from the individual price tags.",0,1418181791,null,0,false,0,cmqfvfj,t3_2otm9w,t1_cmqfvfj,t1_cmqf8m8,null,1425513204,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

false,Brandmon,cnty-commonwealth,British Commonwealth,"While you are correct in some of your assessments, the MRA4 was not so clear cut in its faults. The previous iterations of the Nimrod were perfectly functional and capable and could have served for further decades to come until a proper replacement was acquired. The utilisation of seemingly antiquated airframes is not at all uncommon practice within modern air-forces and was well within the capability of BAE to accomplish. Let us not forget that despite the acquisition of the P-8 Poseidon, the US Navy still operates around a hundred P-3 Orions (with more in storage) as its backbone of its ASW force. 

I'd argue that what doomed the Nimrod was a hesitation and uncertainty in its fate. On one hand the MoD wanted *the best*, yet on the other hand it was reluctant to maintain *the best*. This pattern of first demanding very ambitious specifications, then applying cutbacks to project funding without cutting back on specification demands simply condemned the project to a catch-22 that cost it dearly. 

This is too often the case in aircraft development, not only within Britain, but even in nations such as the US with aircraft ranging from the F-111 of days gone by to the F-35 of today. The difference is that the US was always willing to take up the necessary cost to, in the end, get its money's worth and very often a product that was exported. On the other hand the MRA4 was simply abandoned without any attempts to get the least bit of value, for an aircraft that would have by all estimates entered in full service by now, out of the billions of pounds by then invested for naught. 

At present, with the Nimrod axed, the Illustrious-class carriers decommissioned and the existing Type-23 frigates spread too thin, the Royal Navy's ASW capability is simply dysfunctional for the next few years. Whichever way the Nimrod's faults are analysed and speculated and in the face of a Russian Navy that is escalating its budget by 30% *every year*, the foresight shown by whoever was responsible for military planning within Whitehall can only be deemed as a blunder.

Any of those seems to suggest some kind of mental disorder. If, for example, he doesn't care about the harm he does to others, that suggests antisocial personality disorder (a.k.a. sociopathy).

OTOH if that's the case, why's he now in prison rather than in psychiatric care? Perhaps this is one of the downsides of the tendency to deny mental disorder in order to justify the punishment (or revenge).

Anyway, for the ulterior motive, I'd point out that the reason why a person can't be punished based on a law that wasn't in force at the time of the crime is because of human rights law.

It's also common sense, of course. If we're expected to obey the law, we should have some reasonable chance of knowing what the law is. Though people forget that when dealing with certain kinds of particular cases. And if some things are just obviously immoral and intolerable, how come the law didn't recognise that sooner?

Changes to punishments seem less clearly absurd, but I'd be pretty distressed being sentenced for dropping a sweet wrapper to discover the punishment had been changed retroactively to a minimum of 20 years in prison, so where's the acceptable tweaking cut-off?

We knew Suarez was leaving very early on, and we knew Sturridge spends a significant amount of time out injured every season (because he has done each season previous to this one).  Why the hell was it not absolutely critical to get the right attacker into the side to keep our usual tactics from just crumbling around us when 1 player, who is abnormally injury prone, is out for a spell.

That's a Rodgers error, and a huge one.  I know transfer committee and all that, but I would be astonished if he went to the committee and said ""we need a great forward or we're completely boned"" and they responded to him with something like ""lol, no, deal w/it noob""

We clearly had no plan to really bolster this season.  We lost out on Sanchez and then had nothing.  No backup, no shortlist.  Sanchez or nothing.  We ended up with a misfit who's preferred style is the exact opposite of what we do.

Fuck that, it was an utterly colossal error.  It's not entirely BR's fault, but it definitely is some (and probably mostly) his fault.

And that's before we start to look at his bizarre handling of players this season, as well as his obviously failing tactical setup that he refuses to alter in spite of atrocious results.

The attitudes of the players seem completely off as well.  Bar Sterling, Lambert, Coutinho, and Lallana, most of them have looked like they don't care very much.  Gerrard's been giving his all, but he's so limited now.  They pop up with moments where they go all in, but by and large they just seem uninterested, almost bothered, to be out there.  It feels like there's something wrong in the dressing room, something going on behind the scenes disrupting the team's chemistry.

For the record: I'm NOT advocating Rodgers getting the sack.  He just needs to get his shit together quickly.  He seems to have a massive ego right now and it's making him very stubborn.

Pogba has already lived in Manchester and enjoyed the city, he still has friends here so would have a stable social life and integration period.

The deeper issue that Lambert and Balotelli are supposed to be a stop-gap for remains a massive issue anyway, because they're absolutely the wrong type of player to even be temporary solutions.

Lallana for £26mil or whatever it was is the most expensive depth option I've ever seen, and he's definitely good enough to start.  Especially lately, he's been one of the best players on the pitch when he gets a chance, but for reasons unknown he's seeing a lot less time than you'd expect.

Lovren is pants.  Lyon fans will tell you this, and they watched him for years.  He had a phenomenal first half of last season, and then faded to slightly above average by the end of it.  We got had on that one.

We definitely went after Sanchez, and then Remy, and were also looking at Bony. The first through fell through, and I can't fault the club there. Personally I wish the club had coughed up the money for Bony - apparently his wage demands were very high, but nonetheless. Right near the end we were linked with Falcao and Cavani - I doubt either was a serious option, but I can believe we made tentative enquiries about both and then quickly decided they were too damn pricey (and both of them were).

The transfer committee and Rodgers were agreed that we needed a great forward. I'm really fucking curious as to what led them to think Balotelli was an OK eventual option. If the committee pays attention to statistics, then it'd be clear Balotelli wouldn't suit what we wanted. If the committee/Rodgers felt a striker of a certain ""profile"" was required, then they're fucking idiots. 

But, given Rodgers' comments at the time and since, it does feel as if he was told ""the window's almost over, and it's Balotelli or nobody"". Which is unacceptable, and why I'm inclined towards keeping him and overhauling the dysfunctional transfer committee.

You can fault Rodgers for the tactics since - for taking so long to realise that Gerrard at DM didn't work if there wasn't pace up front, for not accepting that Balotelli wasn't worth it without a strike partner, for his strange rotation policy. I don't buy the ego narrative - the only issue he's being stubborn about is shunning Borini. 

It's just that if there was one signing we couldn't fuck up this summer, it was the striker, and that's the one we fucked up - and have been punished hugely for it by Sturridge's prolonged injury.

As for the players, I don't think it's that they don't give a toss, I just think the team doesn't have enough leaders. Gerrard and Kolo are the only ones.

If and when the time comes for Liverpool to part ways with Rodgers, one would hope that a successor would have been groomed and vetted. Reaching back to former players or managers is not the way for Liverpool to progress, when the time comes. 

A knee-jerk firing of Rodgers will NOT help us in the least bit. Rodgers is part of the reason we had an incredible year last year. The players have faith in him - and that is absolutely critical. 

I grant you that his team selection and strategy have been somewhat head-scratching this season. But for all of that - he played around with lineups towards the end of last season with success. 

As shit as this run of form is, we've kept two clean sheets in four games, and only let in two goals. That is a fairly big improvement in terms of where we were previously. I thought Lovren and Skrtel actually had a good game. Plenty has improved in the back since Lucas has returned in a CDM role in front of the back four. 

What we are sorely lacking is pace, and attacking an attacking presence. We will get that back when Sturridge returns. We also got a quick, albeit unfortunately short, glimpse of that in Markovic. 

Give Rodgers time. We can get frustrated at his team selection - every fan base does that - but to call for his firing is absolutely ridiculous.

false,koptimism,lfc99,,"Let's go through them individually, then:

**Sahin** - brought in to play the #8 (CM) role with Gerrard as the #10. Then, after a few games, Rodgers realised Gerrard couldn't do the #10 role the way he used to, and moved him back to the #8. A lack of other options meant Sahin was used in the #10 role. Sahin wasn't suited to it, wasn't happy in it, and was an expensive acquisition - thus, his loan was cut short in January.

**Agger** - Had struggles against physical strikers, and a series of injuries. The struggles against physical strikers never used to be as much of an issue, but Rodgers' setup relied on CB's who could handle more one-on-one duels, exposing Agger's weakness more. Agger admitted, when he left, that his body was struggling to cope with the physical demands of the Premier League. 

**Reina** - Made high-profile mistakes in Rodgers' first season, having also done so the season before under Kenny. With FSG looking to trim the wage bill, Reina's wages didn't match his performances. Also, at the time, Valdes was thinking of leaving Barca and Reina was lined up to replace him. Rodgers and LFC couldn't afford to sit around while this happened and brought in Mignolet to replace him - but then Valdes decides to stay and things are awkward for Reina, so he gets sent off to Napoli; even though it's a loan, all parties involved know it's a permanent farewell. The move to Bayern this summer was just a formality after Napoli failed to pay to make Reina's move to them permanent.

**Borini** - Was told he could leave in the summer. Chose not to because he wanted to fight for a place at LFC, despite Rodgers making it clear to him that he wasn't wanted here. Whatever's happened since, we don't know, though Rodgers is clearly freezing him out now in the hopes that he'll get the message and leave in January.

----

So, there you go. Sahin had to make way for Gerrard; you can argue over whether Agger could've stayed, but the issue is less with his leaving and more with our inadequate replacing of him; IMO it was right to move Reina on but we replaced him badly; and while I wish Rodgers was able to be pragmatic and use Borini now because we need him, I don't know what's happening behind the scenes or whether selling Borini is important to fund a purchase or whatever.",0,1418188593,null,0,false,0,cmqj4jp,t3_2ot9r5,t1_cmqj4jp,t1_cmqdz36,null,1425511541,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

Out: Paulinho (broken record, right?), Chiriches

In: A goddamn creative deep midfielder! I know, we like to point out how weak our attack is, and how we don't have width, etc. but since Modric left, our single greatest need has been a creative midfielder in the center. Eriksen is great and all, but that's not really what he does. He works far better in the Van der Vaart role. 

Every time I watch us play, I see the same problem. We regain the ball in defense, pass it up to Bentaleb, Mason, Dembele, or Paulinho. None of these players have the creativity or the technique to move the ball quickly into the attack. Instead, they jog with the ball, and get caught out, and suddenly we get hit on the counter attack. Every team in the league has figured out that if you run a high press against us, we won't be able to pass the ball out, and you'll force an error.

Even worse, our most effective attacking player, Kane, is being forced to drop back into the midfield to transition the ball into attack. He's not nearly a good enough passer to play that role, and his most effective skills are pretty much useless when he's starting out with the ball forty meters from the net.

If you look back to the good old days, with Modric, we had a diverse attack. Defense regains the ball, passes to Modric, and Modric can choose dozens of different ways to attack. Channel it up to Van der Vaart, and let him lead the attack. Kick it out to Lennon, and let him cross it in to Crouch. Kick it out to Bale, and let him cut inside and take a shot. Punt it forward, and let Crouch nod it on. A diverse attack.

Now, we have pretty much one option: Dribble it up the pitch, and get it trapped in the middle between Eriksen and Kane. The defense sees it coming and stops it.

This has been a long rant, but it all points back to one solution: We need a passing midfielder. Obviously, Schneiderlin seems the best option, but he'll be hard to pry away from the Saints (plus, why would he want to leave?). I have dreams about Moutinho still, but I can't imagine us affording him.

Also, I don't agree that Sherwood would be still be coach without his poor decorum. Levy avoids or at most very carefully manages risk, both to the club and to himself. Whatever his style towards the media, Sherwood was basically unknown before he was hired; sure, he was the reserve or youth coach, but he had no first team experience and certainly wasn't on the media's collective radar as a potential manager for a Premier League side. Such an off-the-board pick for manager was an inherently risky move on Levy's part, and really only palatable as a temporary measure. You don't finish in the top 5 or better for several years, sell your best player for £86 and then buy seven new players, and go with an unknown manager. If he failed, the finger would have been pointed squarely at Levy. No, Levy needed someone with some kind of pedigree, if only to cover his own ass. Hence, Pochetino. The only way Sherwood would have stayed is if we had *really* performed exceptionally well. Making top-four might have done it, but even that would not have been a guarantee. 

Not that I don't think Pochetino is not a better option than Sherwood, but I think Sherwood's days were numbered from the outset. And if Levy had any sense, he would have made that perfectly clear to Sherwood; after all, for someone with no first-team experience but ambitions to make a career of managing at the highest level, even a temporary spell at the Premier League side in a good line to have on your c.v.

He won't get sacked in the middle of the season. Possibility at the end, but not in the middle. And besides, you have to account for the fact that initial plan was to be back and regularly competing in the CL by the end of the 5th year, not the 2nd year. The club is/was well ahead of the plan, but didn't properly prepare for the demands it entails. 

The club bought players to provide depth and have potential stars in the making, but failed to get the necessary players that have gone through the rigors of multiple domestic cup, league, and CL plays.

&gt; Pascoe as interim while we search for a replacement?

Possibility if Henry and co. decide to sack Rodgers, but I honestly don't see Rodgers getting sacked in the middle or even at the end of the season.

&gt; Gerrard as player/manager for now?

I'm going to pass on this one.

&gt; King Kenny to close the season?

No. When he managed during the 2011/2012 season, the club was quite midtable in all aspects of play (though the defense was really good). Kenny was very static in his style of play and couldn't/wouldn't adapt to get the best out of some the players on the pitch.

Honestly, a lot of us (including me) had very high expectations after the previous season. And to see those expectations dashed is forcing us to re-evaluate everything and maybe set more realistic achievements. I've tempered my expectations from being in the top 4 at the end of the season to being in the top 6-8, and making a deep cup run/win (FA and/or League), and possibly try to qualify for CL via Europa League.

A lot of what I'm saying is only based on my own observations of how the team has been performing as well as Rodgers' baffling decisions, but beyond that it's based on watching Liverpool over the years come so close then crash hard.


My first instinct is that he seemingly hasn't been happy with the squad he ended up with when the window closed. I think he's managing as if he's totally uninspired. What I'm not too sure on is whether he was directly responsible for every single signing or if he only had a partial say in who was recruited. I hear a lot of chat on here about which players were definitely his signings and which weren't. Whatever the case may be it's become clear we ended up with a very unbalanced and inexperienced team. We certainly added squad depth but no one has turned out to be a reliable first team player to pick up where we left off last season. If all the signings were his own has he lost inspiration because no one has performed to levels he'd hoped? If the 'committee' are responsible for the signings is he showing a lack of ability to adapt to what he has at hand? I would love to know what's going through his head at the training ground. Does he truly have a bigger picture in mind, or are his team selections coming from a lack of imagination or being hardheaded? I look at the team selections before the games and I wonder (as many of you do) if that really is the best squad for the task at hand. I know the main problem is he's lacking a goal threat. Teams don't seem too worried by us this season. We've already lost the mental battle before kickoff. I wonder if Rodgers knew this all along once Studge got hurt.    

Then there's the firing of the scouting team. Was that in direct response to Rodgers being unhappy with the summer's business? I start to wonder if there's deeper rifts behind the scenes that are affecting Rodgers' managing. To be honest, as long as I've been a Liverpool fan (since '96 if anyone cares) I've never felt that there's been a clear leader pulling the strings behind the scenes. Even nowadays I wonder if FSG are too far removed from football to be able to pick the right people to run the club day to day and season to season. I wonder if there might be too many cooks in the kitchen all working for themselves and not the better of the club.

That leaves the question of putting all this on Rodgers now (or at the end of the season) or seeing if he can right things next season. My own conclusion is that Liverpool still have problems behind the scenes at an administrative level that need sorting. I've never felt like there's a real brains trust running this club as it deserves to be run. It's been a problem all throughout the Premier League era as far as I can tell. A club in perpetual transition. FSG has brought stability to ownership but they haven't brought stability to the backroom staff yet. Rodgers might be talented manager but I get the sense he can't rise above any backroom bullshit the way one whiskey nosed archenemy was able to, at least not at this early stage of his career. So Rodgers could get the sack and perhaps someone with more experience could be the next manager, but until Liverpool is run as the winning club it's history dictates I'm afraid we'll only ever have close calls with success and not the longstanding success we all long for.

2. convictions for rape / rapes reported 
3. convictions for rape / arrests on suspicion of rape
4. convictions for rape / charges brought for rape 

As we get further down the list the number get much more reliable, but what campaigners really complain about is #1, which unfortunately uses numbers which are, to be generous, not known to be reliable. #4 is about 60%, is that “high” or “low”? How could we tell? 

In addition, there are things like:

* charges for rape / reported rapes 

which is about 30% 

The way campaigners talk about these numbers suggests strongly that they think the only acceptable level of each of these rates is 100% and that the only change which counts as “improvement” is increase. This strikes me as an argument for summary conviction, which seems a dangerous notion.

false,AeB18,lfc99,,"I'm going to disagree with you here. We bought some players that are for the future, and some for now. 

Manquillo is better than last season's fullbacks bar Glen Johnson and Jon Flanagan. He's also 20 years old and has potential to improve. 

Moreno I agree entirely, his defensive work has been shocking so far. 

Lallana is needed to provide depth and competition for Coutinho, who was our only attacking midfielder last season. You can not compete in the CL and top of the PL with one attacking mid, granted Gerrard has moved back into this role this season which moves Lallana to the bench. 

Balotelli is a massive upgrade on Borini, don't kid yourself. 

Lovren is...interesting. I don't think we needed him either but having 4 first team CB's is good. I would prefer Agger tho :(

Markovic is miles better than Ibe or Suso and you're deluded if you can't see that. Ibe and Suso are good players, but Markovic has potential to be a superstar and is already a damn good player. Showed the good and the bad tonight. 

Can is a young player, and 4th choice CM in a team that plays with 2 central mids. I hope to see more of him, I really rate him. 

You didn't mention Lambert but he's paid himself off in the month of November, and before that has been solid. He's out of gas now though.

I think the only really big miss this summer is Moreno. But the lack of big hits is extremely worrying. We've gone for players that are good, and useful to have, but none that actually improve the first team. None of our summer signings belong in our best XI for me besides maybe Lallana, which is just shocking business. 

Of course the young fullbacks, Balotelli, Markovic, and Can have potential to improve, but we're not in a good spot at the moment. Potential is not good enough right now and I think we need to really upgrade at striker and goalkeeper this January or we'll miss out on Europe altogether next season.

It doesn't, though; **wages** are a far better indicator of player quality, which is why there's a stronger correlation between a team's total wage bill and their league position than there is between net spend and league position.

A transfer fee is purely an indication of how valuable that player is perceived to be to the buying and selling clubs. Of course player quality plays a role in transfer fee, but so do many other factors - time left on the player's contract, importance of the player to the selling club, importance of the player to the buying club, financial concerns of the selling club, financial capacity of the buying club.

Nail and head.

Occasionally, an organisation might actually need an expert in a particular field for a short period of time (which I believe was the original role of consultants) but often consultants are a parasitic life form feeding off the incompetence of senior managers. Quite often consultants know less than the front line workers but slightly more than the manager who hired them and the consultant is usually believed more than the workers because if the consultant was shown be an incompetent buffoon then this reflects poorly on the manager.

Yeah, I don't think there is any evidence to suggest that teaching kids 2 languages when they grow up harms their literacy in their first language. And by the way, the Welsh language is probably more of a European language than English. It's similar to French in a lot of ways, just look at the days of the week - Monday, Lundi, Llun. Tuesday, Mardi, Mawrth. Wednesday, Mecredi, Mercher...etc etc.

The important thing about Plaid is to remember that in Westminster elections, we're not going to win a majority. However, in the event of a hung parliament where parties have to do deals with eachother (which is very likely this time) a vote for Plaid will mean that the Westminster parties will actually have to consider Wales for a change - if we do a deal with anyone, it will be on the basis of the redistribution of wealth in the UK - not only to Wales, but Scotland, the North of England, Cornwall etc. 

The main reason I would say to vote Plaid in Wales, not Green, is because Plaid can actually win.

Obviously losing Suarez/Sturridge is massive but it's not like goal scoring is our only problem, there isn't really a single area that's going right.


What makes me doubt Rodgers is when glaringly obvious weaknesses such as defending corners are not addressed season to season. 


You can't just buy 3 new defenders (2 that have never played in the premiere league before) and expect everything to be ok. 


Last year you could see at least the logical reasoning behind his substitutions - eg. Sterling is tiring late in the game so he brought Coutinho on. This year he seems to want to take Lallana  off every game even though he doesn't start every match so it's not a resting issue. This is doubly confusing as Lallana has been a rare highlight at times this year.


The curious case of Fabio Borini - In the summer when Sunderland were bidding for him I was going mad that we missed out on the reported £14m. Now that we have him we may as well give him a go. As far as I remember his only chance this year has been a sub appearance vs West Ham. Surely he deserves more of a chance especially as our main 2 forwards are injured. To not even be on the bench when we have no other forwards is again baffling. 


I would love to be able to talk to him and just ask what is going on? There must be things happening behind the scenes that he doesn't talk about in interviews but as we don't know what they are it just gets labled as incompetance.

&gt; Women and men are different. Equal treatment of men and women does not result in
equal outcomes. Homes and children define many women’s lives. To take this away from
them when it may be all that they have causes huge damage to women. 

Aren't we trying to change this? If we are going to embed gender privilege into law then we need to stop pretending that men are ever going to be equals in terms of child care. With all the other results that come with it.

&gt;  the nature and
seriousness of women’s offending has not, on the whole, been getting worse and the
disproportionate increase in the women’s prison population over the last 10 years is
more likely the result of courts using custody more frequently for women for less serious
offences. 

The number of custodial sentences has actually increased for men and women year on year. Why on earth is this a relevant point for this debate? If there is an increase disproportionately then maybe that is because previously judges wouldn't imprison any woman?

&gt; The majority of female offenders have committed non-violent offences and present
little risk to the public. Many present a far greater risk to themselves. They have been
recognised as more “troubled” than “troublesome”. 

The vast majority of men are the same. If anything more women in prison are dangerous as a proportion due to existing sentencing discrimination.

&gt; Custodial experience affects women differently and disproportionately from men. For
example, they are located further from their homes and families because of the small
number and geographical spread of women’s prisons, which makes visiting difficult.
Women in prison are less likely than men to have someone on the outside looking after
their home and family and they are more likely to lose their home and children as a
result of imprisonment.

This is more or less a restatement of their first point. Women have an existing imbalance in child care we are supposedly trying to correct. Once we finally have parental equality in all things this problem goes away. We should not enshrine in law a principle to deal with what is supposedly a temporary transitional issue.

&gt; Short prison sentences do not successfully deflect from further offending and for many
women make their lives and those of their children worse.

How is this different to men? Non custodial sentences have been proven time and again to be superior to custodial ones. Take it up with the public, they are the ones opposed.

Then there is the numbers in this report

&gt; The most obvious difference between men and women within the criminal
justice system is that women commit far less crime than men. Women represent half the general
population but in 2004/05, for example, there were 1,120,200 (83%) men arrested for recorded
crime offences compared with 233,600 (17%) women, and the female prison population is only
5.5% of the total prison population (based on population on 17 November 2006 of 4,416 female
and 75,379 male)

This more or less openly admits women are already being given disproportional favouritism in sentencing. For them to form 17% of arrests (I'll ignore police discrimination in arrests for now) and make up only 5% of the population in prison says a lot.

TBH a lot of this strikes me as ""prison is obviously bollocks, we think we can sob story our way out of this injustice for half the population"". Which will of course leave the unfortunates other half of the population still suffering under an insane system. I'm not going to go point for point through this whole report because it is lengthy and frankly I don't see anything compelling in it.

Anyway, AFAIK the pumping-water-uphill aspect isn't really about long-term energy storage, more flattening out the peaks and troughs in demand.

These views stem from the experience my housemate has had, since she had her CBT: her only other road experience was on a bicycle.

&gt; **Introducing a theory test**

I can see the benefit to the principle. I'd say it should involve the actual theory parts of the theory test, rather than the ""how should you react?"" or ""What should you do?"" bits.  
More the road signs, rights of way, that sort of thing.

&gt; ** Allow more flexibility for repeat CBT learners**

Agree here.  
A CBT ""top up"" would be a good thing. Maybe half hour at most, making sure they know the basics [just as a ""better safe than sorry""], followed by an accelerated off road, where they just do the manoeuvres without instruction, and then onto the road.  
It could be an afternoon or morning, rather than a full day.

&gt; **One-day course is fine, but it needs to be easier to extend training if necessary**

I'm half on half here, as I *don't* think the one day course is enough.  
After only 2 hours on the road, many are still at the ""concentrating on how to do things"" rather than now paying to the roads around them. The OSMPML takes a fair bit to become internalised and habitual, and without reinforcement for longer than those 2 hours, can easily become sloppy, incorrect and/or dangerous.

&gt; **Assess learners’ carefully for bike handling skills and awareness of the highway code**

I like the ""continue off road training"" part here, if they're not believed to be ready for on-road.  
They've paid for the day's instruction, they should get it.

&gt; **Limit validity of automatic CBT certificates**

Yes. Although, an 'upgrade' should be available. This could be similar to a repeat CBT above, that doesn't require the full day.

&gt; ** Encourage progress to full licence by reducing validity of CBT certificates**

No. Because it won't.  
For someone who's been on the road for that year, there will be *zero* stress with a CBT, and will still cost less than a test.  
There is no desire for people to get a full A1 licence, because the average 125 is not motorway worthy, and actually borderline dangerous on one [no acceleration, little chance of actually reaching 70, etc.]. Hell, where I did my instruction for my tests, they'd only had **1** person go for the A1 since directive 3 came live.  
The A1 needs to allow for a more powerful bike. Plain and simple.  
250cc to 300cc would be ideal. Not a massive leap in horses, but a large enough leap that there's the torque for acceleration when needed, and can actually comfortably hit 70 for motorways.

Airbus wants to compete though, with their [C295](http://militaryaircraft-airbusds.com/Aircraft/C295/C295About.aspx) (est £20m each) as a less capable but more affordable option.

As for the F 35, regardless of the plane itself (which is a long way from perfect) the project to create it was indisputably a cock up. Here a couple of decent explanations about the F 35 I've seen:

&gt;Multi-role is proven to work, the F-16 and F-18 programs are proof enough of that.

&gt;One problem is that the F-35 is actually three aircraft pretending to be one. I haven't actually looked at the numbers, but if you divide the cost of the program by three, I doubt it's still the most expensive weapons program in history. So, I bet the cost problems are exaggerated to some extent because journalists never actually know what they're talking about.

&gt;Multi-role doesn't really overload a modern fighter with too many requirements, but trying to be three different jets at once clearly does. There are just too many compromises that have to be made in order to keep some semblance of part interchangeability between the different versions.

&gt;As far as performance, I think the main problem is that the ""all-stealth air force"" idea is a stupid one. Stealth is great, but it's more of a niche technology. For instance, a stealth air superiority fighter is a great idea. A stealth deep strike or SEAD aircraft is also a great idea. However, stealth makes a lot less sense for a lot of ground-attack missions, and pretty much no sense for CAS.

&gt;The design constraints placed on the F-35 by the stealth design prevent it from being as good at these roles as people expected it to be. It simply can't carry enough stuff internally to be able to do missions the same way the F-16 or F-18 can. Those are more successful as multi-role aircraft because you can load them very heavily for a strike mission, or load them more lightly for an air superiority mission. The F-35 had to be designed lightly for the air superiority mission, but then fattened so it had a prayer of doing ground-attack. But because of the stealth restrictions, it can't do a very good job of that mission. So it ends up being an all-round turd.

&gt;The other problem is the classic American acquisitions problem of asking for the moon. They decide to include all these nonexistent technologies as key features of the new aircraft. You end up with a hybrid production-design/research project. Research projects always take longer than you expect, which means going over-budget. But now you're doing your research on a full production scale, which means instead of spending $4 million when you thought it would be $2 million, those numbers start with a 'b'. The fact that you're doing this with not just one technology, but 20, and trying to make all these brand-new things work together at the same time, means you're fucked for sure. There's just no way to do that without it turning into a disaster. We really need to do more small-scale research at high TRL before we decide to include this stuff in front-line hardware.

Explanation 2 the TL;DR is that the program was badly conceived and mismanaged. The aeroplane will be fine, but needlessly expensive. Bad value proposition. Too late now, though...

&gt;Say you have 10 features that you want. It doesn't matter what they actually are, you've still got 10 things. So you need development programs for each of those ten things. That means whether it's one aircraft or ten aircraft those ten things need ten development programs.
So, the question is: are there advantages to doing one aircraft with ten features or ten aircraft with one feature?

&gt;Well, they start out on a level playing field: both require ten development programs - one for each feature. From there the multirole concept loses out big time due to feature interaction.
Basically, if you develop ten aircraft then each feature can be developed in isolation. This is a good thing; you get to manage only a small set of variables for each feature.

&gt;If you do the multirole thing, then all ten features suddenly interact with each other. Not only do you have to manage the variables inherent to each feature, you also need to manage the interactions between features.

&gt;From there it's simple math:

&gt;In the individual aircraft scenario you end up with: 10 variables

&gt;In the multirole aircraft scenario you end up with: 100 variables (10 base variables each with 9 additional interactions).

&gt;So the multirole program actually ends up being ten times more complicated for exactly the same functionality.

&gt;If you make the case that each F-35 variant is a single ""feature"", then you would expect the F-35 program to be 3 times more expensive than 3 separate programs. It would be very difficult to recover that kind of outlay on the backside in operational costs, especially considering that the f-35 variants currently have surprisingly little commonality. Commonality is basically limited to engines and avionics, and those have been shared between multiple aircraft basically since the dawn of flight.

&gt;IMO the decision to do the multirole F-35 was made without (or ignoring) input from competent technical advisors, or it was made using so much ""data"" that the truth was completely obfuscated (""making this more complicated than it really is"", alt; ""fooling yourself""). I also believe the F-35 program runs utterly counter to the original methods and ideals which made skunkworks so successful.

The government has set 2Mbps as the minimum *however* Ofcom itself have given figures of 8Mbps and 10Mbps at different times as what should be a lower limit. Various other institutions such as the EU have given other minimums as well, none as low as 2Mbps.

I got 2Mbps broadband in 2004 just for comparison. That in 10 years we've not made more progress to basic / standard broadband is sad.

The problem is that the government is heralding the broadband delivery project as a success (ergo no additional funding) because ""97% of people now have access to broadband"" - but it's clear that within a few years, perhaps even now, that lower bound is too low and not practical.

The focus needs to be on the percentage who get a 'standard' broadband of 10Mbps or more. Even just reporting on it in those terms pressurizes both consumers to *demand* 10Mbps minimums, **and** suppliers to provide a 10Mbps package as standard.

As to what it's worth to the economy? Well, the EU reckons that delivering good broadband to an additional 10% of the population will deliver an increase in GDP of between 1% and 1.5%. So at 85% at 10Mbps, we have scope to grow the economy by around another 1.5% - 2.0% by plugging the gaps.

What he can do is set off on a run and make a defence lose its shape and fall apart trying to stop him beating player after player, at which point he can find players making good runs ahead of him and put them into a lot of space.

At the moment he will go on these runs and the only players ahead of him (if any) are Sterling and Lambert (Balotelli earlier in the season). These players aren't great at making these runs, Lambert and Balotelli aren't that type of striker and Sterling just isn't a striker, I personally think he is best on the wing.

We simply need strikers who are good at running onto through balls, and we don't have one available. Just because Borini is a bit more mobile than either Lambert or Balotelli doesn't mean he is any better.

&gt; What changed after 2001 wasn't terrorism, the big change after 2001 was the hysterical response of the US 

What changed after 2001 was that the US and the rest of the developed world recognised that Islamism was the most significant threat since the end of the Cold War and decided to act seriously upon it. 

&gt; They [the US and allies] started barging around the world kicking over sand hills, stirring up trouble, and embarked on a vicious campaign of victimisation and demonisation against their indigenous Muslim populations. Guess what? That's caused a little bit of resentment.

No it doesn't, all it suggests is that there wasn't enough evidence to support a conviction; ~~the percentage difference between mens arrest and conviction is at 6.7%, only 1.2% higher than womens' arrest:conviction ratio (if my maths is wrong, please tell me).~~ Similarly, only 9% of children whose mothers are in prison receive care from their fathers and close family relatives.

It genuinely does seem that women commit fewer crimes, and the sentences they do serve can be commuted to a community sentence in light of the rather bleak fact that their children would likely go into care, or they would face the prospect of hefty care bills.

And only 2% of motorway accidents are fatal. There's no data for how many fatalities are caused by breaking the speed limit on a motorway, but if we extrapolate, we can assume that it's barely a handful.

As for Lambert &amp; Balotelli, I think Rickie was brought in at the start of the window to be 4th choice striker behind Sturridge &amp; 2 new forwards. The plan would be to throw him on for the last 10mins to give the team an alternative dimension in games where we would need a direct breakthrough. Unfortunately he has ended up playing alot more than planned, so rather than come on and win long balls for 10mins in a desperate situation, he is being asked to lead the line every week which he just isnt up to. Balotelli was an odd signing, I agree. But when the original 2 or 3 targets fell through, was it a case of Mario or nothing? Hard to say, but I do trust that Rodgers has identified a more mobile forward to bring in to the club and I think he is hoping to sell Borini to fund a new forward (which explains why he has cut Borini off all together, to make the point that he needs to leave in Jan)

I can see why Rodgers prefers Lambert to Borini, although he has played too many minutes recently and hasn't done anything apart from the two goals he has scored, he did actually score those goals and has been a reasonably prolific goalscorer over the past few seasons. Rodgers gambled on Lambert doing the job but he hasn't looked like scoring since he bumbled one in vs Ludogorets and he clearly doesn't have the fitness either.

Rodgers' greatest flaw is that he is stubborn though. He isn't flexible and won't have his authority or wishes challenged, and nor will he give a player a chance once he has decided he wants a player to leave. See Reina, see no defensive coach, see Borini. He made the decision to not play Fabio Borini and only play Rickie Lambert.

Sure, and I'll counter some of your points.

&gt;I think he's been dealt a cruel hand with the loss of Suarez and Sturridge at the same time.

Absolutely. But I don't think he did enough to replace Suarez.

&gt;He has a preferred game plan which we all saw the success of last season. Unfortunately without the same players, a different game plan is needed and I agree that he has struggled to find the best system to suit the players available.

To a certain extent, but he didn't play with that style in the previous season. It was only possible because of Suarez and Sturridge. A good manager should be able to work out a decent enough system with two missing players.

&gt;We all know Balotelli wasnt the first choice of striker, even Loic Remy would have been a better alternative, giving us much needed pace which suits our system. Alexis Sanchez would have been the perfect replacement for Suarez but theres not much Rodgers could do if the lad wants to live in London.

Balotelli was indeed a bizarre choice.

&gt;I think Rodgers man management has actually been pretty good.

Not sure about this. He drover Agger out of the club, and does generally seem to piss people off.

Henderson is definitely an exception of course.

&gt;Players like Kolo, Enrique and Lucas have returned to the team after long spells out and yet still seem to want to do well for their manager

I'm not sure they want to do well fro their manager. I think they want to do well in the little playing time they've been given.

&gt;plus Rodgers has handled the Stevie G issue really well, especially lately in my opinion

Not sure about this one, but then we can only speculate on what goes on behind closed doors.

&gt;I also think his use of subs has been good overall, not 100% correct, but at times like last night, his subs changed the game for the better.

Firstly, what do you do if your grid is being kept stable by battery backup at rush hour?  There will be times when you might need storage to run the grid for 2-3 days if you've got a big chunk of renewables.  Are people not going to drive during this period?

Secondly, yes vehicles spend most of their time parked, but in lots of different places.  Would every single car-park in the country have to be retrofitted with high-capacity cabling to ensure you constantly had access to your battery fleet?

Thirdly, how many extra cycles is this going to add to EV batteries, and how much will it shorten their life by?

Finally, how many vehicles would you need?  I've seen figures that suggest for the UK to have enough stability for a long period of low wind we'd need to have double the number of electric cars that we currently do petrol cars, all wiht 40Kwh batteries.

I still don't understand why not just have a spin-off of Doctor Who that stars a female time-lord and solve this problem once and for all. Hell, wedge in another half-regeneration and make a whole series out of it, ret-con into the space where the series had ended and Paul McGann's Doctor picks up again; there's a great deal of explaining about the Tardis interiors and the Master that could be done to bridge the gap between Classic Who and New Who. Since Sara Jane Adventures is no longer with us, and Torchwood doesn't seem to be doing much lately, a female timelord series would be rather 'timely'.

I think he deserved massive criticism for the way we played in October/November. His management of the team was really poor. Gerrard is a legend and it's a lot easier for us armchair managers to say he should be dropped than it is for Rodgers to actually do it. Still. It needed to be done and once it was we improved.

Without Suarez we were going to be blunted. Then we lost Sturridge and even Balotelli. I think the sort of hapless attacking performances we've mostly seen in the last 4 games are to be expected and there's not much that can be done about it now.

We've tried Coutinho. We've tried Lallana. Without a striker it just doesn't work.

I'd agree that it's Rodgers' (and whoever else is responsible for signings) fault that we're short a forward but I think Rodgers has made strides lately to do the best he can with what he has available.

come on dude, two ""missing players""? they were the two best strikers in the league last season. 

also i think your being a **little** hard on rodgers and his transfer dealings. his hands were tied in a LOT of ways over the summer. losing suarez wasnt his decision and was a disaster from his perspective. FSG's inconsistent stand on not overpaying for players or certain players or whatever the fuck it is these days is not his fault and makes things really difficult from his perspective. Alexis not wanting to live in liverpool was a slap in the face but one that every liverpool manager has dealt with before, and is not his fault and is a huge frustration from his perspective. and then you go into this season and Woy's antics getting sturridge injured(when he's always been a delicate player) yet another disaster from rodger's perspective and something that HE could have easily prevented, but wasn't his fault either. 

I know you know all of this but i guess what i'm saying to you and all ""Rodgers out"" folks is: let's all have a hard look at the facts (insert rafa joke here) and have a little more perspective. 

To employ the cliche girlfriend/manager comparison, i was sad when rafa was sacked. I knew it had to be done, as you often do in relationships, but i was sad nonetheless. Rodgers' time is not over, nor should it be. If we break up with him now then i fear he will become: ""that one that got away"".

This shit pisses me off, it puts so many caveats in the arguement it is meaningless. Stability in this argument means supplying all the load since low wind probably means no wind. So lets take the total load of energy consumption, divide it by 40 kWh and use that number. 

I also don't know why you've picked 40 kWh, the Tesla Model S ships with both a 60 and an 85 kWh battery, By using the larger battery size your number of double the ratio of electric:petrol cars becomes just under a 1:1 ratio allowing a slightly smaller number of electric vehicles on the road than we currenly have petrol ones to meet demands.

I appreciate that the Obscene Publications Act 1953 is vague and odd, but it's there. The BBFC have not introduced new regulations, just clarified the existing ones based on information from the CPS. 

Female ejaculation is not permissible because it is indistinguishable to a censor from urination which has never been legal in UK porn. Breath play is not permissible in R-rated films because imitation can lead to death, and whilst you can argue so would imitating almost any action in any action scene in almost any Hollywood film, they are prohibited in what they can allow in this specific area. Face-sitting is therefore not permitted.

As the BBFC have explained, spanking and verbal abuse are not banned per se, but extremely violent abuse is, because it diminishes women. Campaigners are effectively arguing in the name of equality the right to watch women being punched and strangled whilst being fucked. That does not seem to add up to me.

I get that people are annoyed about this, but basically these regulations were *always* there for DVDs, and now they have been updated to make sure they cover on-demand content as well (think about iPlayer/4od on your current STB also getting content alongside it from porn channels, that sort of thing). They are not new guidelines prohibiting porn: they are enabling hardcore pornography matching legal DVD hardcore porn to be sold on set top boxes on-demand.

If you don't like the guidelines, you need to campaign for a reform of the Obscene Publications Act and the BBFC's role in relation to that. Insisting that it's all just made up nonsense and censorship means you haven't actually looked into:

1. What the BBFC did

Well, exactly.  We want to grid to function in the most extreme cases.  95% stability would not be good enough.  I'm pointing out legitimate issues here, which would need to be addressed for the scheme to become remotely close to viable on a large scale, I don't see why you need to get offended.

At the moment we have a relatively simple balancing mechanism.  We burn more gas when there's more demand.  All the energy storage and renewable solutions I've researched (and I do read the journal papers) involve adding many more layers of complexity onto an already extremely complex system.  Combined with the fact that we're rolling out renewables well before storage is even close to economically or technically viable on the scale needed, and that the grid will struggle to balance much beyond current wind penetrations, and yes I'm legitimately worried.

It is not like they can just catch up on those online is it? No take something off the TV put it exclusively online so we can show another channel twice. Genius.

Good point. It's absolutely genius to take one channel online-only, whilst making another +1 so people can watch it an hour later on their TV, instead of on the dedicated playback service that's already offered called iPlayer.

It's not like people don't already use iPlayer to catch up on BBC1 programmes now is it? I dreaded missing Doctor Who and being unable to watch what I missed until an hour had passed.

I can see 'why' it can be done, when you have conflicting programmes on at the same time on different channel, but really, delayed channels seem like a dying medium in the age of the internet and technology that removes the limit for rewatching programmes and allows access any time of the day through a convenient service.

Now, ITV Player and 4oD might not be good services by the mixed reviews they get, but BBC iPlayer is fine, and this is the BBC we're talking about right here.

It's just great of them to completely alienate a demographic from the public television service. Just goes to show you how much these public institutions are there for all of us, not just catering to certain demographics such as the more aged members of society and 'popular' programming for BBC1 such as The Voice which is just a waste of money for what the BBC should be doing.

In the situation where an employer does not pay enough for the worker to make ends meet, while requiring hours that do not permit the worker to hold a second job, but the worker is able to continue working for that employer because he receives payments from the government, it is reasonable to say that the government is paying the workforce so the employer doesn't have to - the employer receives, in effect, subsidised labour.

He was ""forced"" to play both Sturridge and Suarez since they were doing so good, and any team with both those and an in-form Sterling + Coutinho etc is bound to play attacking entertaining and fast football.

You could see it in 2012/2013, we played the same style as this season untill January when Sturridge joined.. so we have played 1 full year now of boring ineffective football that have given bad results under Rodgers, and 1.5 years of good football with Sturridge/Suarez. Allthough even when Suarez was banned for the start of last season we also played boring (grinding out 1-0, which was great, but still, that's how we played).

It's not like Rodgers hasn't been given enough time either, he hasn't had 6 months with this team, he's had over 2 years.. and 90% of the players that Rodgers choose to start our games are players that have been here for that long! So, after players have gotten to know eachother for 2 years, with the same manager, this style of play we've had the last 6 months seems to be the standard..

Edit: To be clear, I don't want Rodgers sacked yet, but I can't believe anyone who sais they aren't worried at all if we will ever get anywhere unless we buy a couple of supergood players under market value..there has literally been NO progression this season in 25 games.

I related this story in another thread: in 1997, James Ferman (director of the BBFC) attempted to relax the R18 classification guidelines ""by the back door"", by granting R18 certificates to a handful of videos that ordinarily would be denied, and thereby setting a precedent for future videos. It has been suggested that he was encouraged to do so by the Conservative government at the time, but - this being 1997 - by the time he put this plan into action, Labour were in power and Jack Straw (the Home Secretary) took a dim view of the BBFC ""overstepping its authority"".

Markovic's cameo was the most purposeful and spirited performance of anyone on the pitch. Shame he got sent off, but you can't blame Brendan for that. Lambert was not contributing in any respect whatsoever, so bringing on Markovic was a change from 4-5-0 to 4-6-0. Picking Lambert in the first place (or not resting him at the weekend) were the mistakes, but if Borini is really not an option, what's he going to do (I'd have put either Moreno or Henrique up front and hoped something mad would come of it).

The other point I disagree with is the team selection in Spain.

He did the right thing at chelsea by getting rid of the old guard which apparently Roman told him too do. The players turned on him. At Porto he was fantastic. Spurs he was good aswell but the signings he made were not his aswell. Apparently there was his chairmans. 

He is now at Zenit and doing very well. Id be willing to give him a shot...

Rafa is obvious choice...As of now Top 4 is gone...There is no way under rogers and a fully fit squad we can get Top 4 under him. Rafa would give us a shot but Europa League is where the risk of changing guard may pay dividends. 

Rogers wont do shit in Europa but Rafa can win it us. A mastermind in Europe and this season its the back door into champions league. Its the only way I can see us qualifying tbh.

With 80m wasted...it is

Lovren - 20 mil really....wouldnt pay 10 for him. Looks lost and Toure is much much better. Where the hell is Sakho. 
Moreno - 12  mil - Best signing...Very impressed but has been dropped now for some bizarre reason
Manquillo - Cant argue- On loan - Been decent
Lallana - 25m - Never going to get that back on him...but why doesnt he start. We need creativity and you cant get no one better than him and coutinho in our team
Can - 10m - Really??
Markovic - 20m - Really?? Need i say more
Lambert - 4mil - Useless - Slow - Not worthy of playing for a mid table team never mind a possible title challenger
Balotelli - 16m - Backfired, not been great...but has also been targeted by media. Doesnt run around but its not his game....we knew that when we bought him. Sterling has been shit this season aswell, possible head turned by Real Madrid? Balo hasnt been great but Sterling hasnt either...they dont mention him ever in media.

Existing shares will be converted into non-voting equity or loan stock. One important initial circumstance when this might be done is upon the sale of a small business or upon the death or retirement of the owner. Another initial application might be to football or other sporting clubs where a majority of the season ticket holders, supported by the wider local community, might want to bring a local club into mutual ownership. In the longer run we would envisage some process of this kind applying, with appropriate safeguards, to all companies.

I suppose my main gripe with the article is that these classification guidelines are clearly the target of the public outrage, and yet it is the recent ruling that is being conflated with these outdated sensibilities that have nonetheless been in place for many years.

As far as I'm aware, the only people that have seriously challenged the restrictions of the R18 classification are groups involved in practicing and producing pornography depicting these acts. I suppose I am frustrated that depicting these acts has been essentially banned in physical media for many years, and no one else seemed to be aware. Now people are aware, but are misinformed that these restrictions are somehow ""new"" and so must be associated with the recent amendments to the law.

I suppose I think of it like this, the restrictions imposed on pornographic material by the BBFC are outdated, sexist and absurd, and have been in place for many years. The Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 is an attempt to control the online porn market. Now both can be considered state censorship, but for entirely different reasons. More importantly, if the AMSR 2014 is overturned this will not have any effect on the aforementioned restrictions imposed by the BBFC.

I suppose my point is, the AMSR 2014 has no political agenda other than to control online markets. The stuff about banning fisting and such is another problem in itself.",0,1418216678,null,0,false,0,cmqq69p,t3_2oss35,t1_cmqq69p,t1_cmqpqmo,null,1425506620,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Your job as a manager is to do the best with what you have, not compare and contrast to that one time when everything was working out. The team is uninspired and for gods sake cannot defend! Thank baby Jesus for Lucas recently because the back four are cursed. 

Brendan HAS to figure out how to keep a clean sheet before he can recreate his attacking philosophy. He has to balance the *lack* of goals with defensive continuity. 

That being said he's committed everything to LFC. He's a young manager himself and will improve. I think sacking him would ultimately hurt us in the long run. Despite the poor results we should have faith in his future and the future strength of the team.

The classic question at that point would be ""what tax code is your employer using"" since that controls how income tax is calculated, but if you're not getting payslips you probably don't know.  As noted this is a major issue - employees are legally entitled to written pay slips on or before the relevant pay date. ""Issues in the payroll system"" are not an acceptable reason for an employer to fail to provide these; certainly not for several pay periods in a row.

If your work is more ""lumpy"" you may be being overtaxed.

In either case provided things are being reported correctly to HMRC then they should review your account over the summer after the end of the tax year in April and refund you any overpayments automatically. You shouldn't have to complete a full tax return.

If, as /u/The_Inertia_Kid mentions, your employer is being dishonest rather than merely incompetent then there could be bigger issues so you really need to concentrate on finding out what's going on there.  If you can't get anywhere on your own then look at getting some help and advice:

Here's a much more recent study[2] , which found evidence to suggest that bilingualism helps to protect against cognitive decline in old age. This study[3] suggested that bilinguals have an advantage in learning new languages over monoglots, while this one[4] found that bilinguals performed better in certain cognitive tasks than monolinguals.

None of those things are proficiency in a main language spoken by lots of people and that's what matters in the real world. I'm not saying bilingualism doesn't have cognitive advantages, it really does. It also has costs too [1](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/neu/16/4/562/), [2](http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;uid=2003-10949-019). Vocabulary (i.e. words known) of children learning two languages is roughly the same as those learning one language, only since it is across two languages their working vocabulary (if you will) for each is reduced in their language development. By adulthood if both languages are used these differences obviously close. That being said success is measured on English speaking metrics not Welsh speaking ones, employers don't care if you get an A* in Welsh if you fail English. I suspect with your anecdotal example of yourself you were never at risk of not passing English. If I had done Welsh academically I wouldn't have failed it either, I still wouldn't have ever used it. I have anecdotal examples of kids who only passed their English GCSEs by dropping Welsh and devoting that time to more English lessons.

Do you come from a Welsh speaking family? I'm guessing since you got sent to a Welsh medium school you do. Again anecdotal but my friend's girlfriend's kid is struggling in a Welsh medium school because in our bit of Wales nobody speaks it to him outside of that environment. From what I've read it will take a year or two for him to be able to adjust, that's a huge load of school time effectively lost. That has got to affect him.

&gt;I'd like to see kids of primary school age learning a foreign language alongside both Welsh and English.

Where are you getting the time and resources for all these things? Have you ever worked in a school? They already have loads to do. Targets to meet. Budgets to keep.

At the end of the day there are only 750,000 Welsh speakers in the world, 600,000 of those are in Wales, less than 20% of the population, only about 16% of the population are fluent and these are heavily dependent on area. It is of virtually no economic advantage to teach it. Wales is falling behind in education and I think that pouring time and money into a sinking ship is pointless. Typically when a second language is used it has usage around the world and is therefore worth the time learning, Spanish for example has over 400 million speakers worldwide, definitely worth learning. If I told people I was going to learn Scottish Gaelic (spoken by less than 1% of Scotland) they'd say why are you bothering to do that?

I'm not going to suggest he's been perfect, there have been some bad line-ups and the refusal to use Borini is baffling. Rodgers has been accountable for some things that's true.

But at the same time, he's had his best player and focal point of the team out for 3 months, twice suffering new injuries days before he was due to return. That's enough to cause problems for ANY manager. It means the team is hard to settle and sculpt when the best player can't play. 

This reminds me of his first few months here. Rodgers only had Suarez and Borini (who was injured) to play up front and we struggled, Sturridge comes in during January and we improved 10 fold. This year Rodgers only had Sturridge and a few back-ups, so he bought Balotelli late on to avoid a repeat of 2012. Except then we lost Sturridge so we were in the same position again, just with a  better midfield but Balotelli &amp; Lambert instead of Suarez.

Obviously Balotelli doesn't quite fit the system but he was bought, a little in desperation, to avoid a situation we were in before that Rodgers knew would cause problems, I can appreciate this. Unfortunately injuries meant we fell into the same situation anyway despite Rodgers making conscious attempts to fix it via the transfer window. Maybe we should have done better in the transfer market overall, but it's not like we didn't try. Sanchez was clearly a target but we failed to get him. It's not Rodgers' fault we aren't a peak destination at this point. I think the whole transfer committee got a little flustered by our inability to land Sanchez- room for improvement there but not cause to start sacking.

In regards to the line-up issues that's where Rodgers is at fault. Even so it's not like he's leaving out players who are guaranteed to make a difference. Lallana is the only player who I think has warranted more game time with his play this season. People moaning that Coutinho should have been in the starting 11 against Basel- have you seen him start this season? He's been great as a sub, dreadful in the first 11. This is why I feel Rodgers has not been as egregious as people suggest. He has depth but doesn't have a starting 11 like he did last year so it's a new problem for him he's yet to overcome. 

Rodgers failed in his first time in the Champions League campaign with a much weaker team than the one that got into the competition in the first place. Maybe he could have done better, but I don't think it means he HAS to go. League performance does need to improve, but, fortunately, everyone else has been shit this season, so we can afford to wait for January to see if Sturridge and potential new players make a difference.

I'm getting sick of the Rodgers out brigade. Luis Suarez was NOT the only reason we came 2nd last season, and Rodgers' has earned more faith in a time where the cards are stacked against him a little.

Or we can cheer for him to be sacked thanks to a few bad months and fall back into transition again, with a new coach, new system, massive turnover and lose the guy who has helped develop Sterling, Coutinho, Henderson, Sturridge etc into top players. If you guys fancy that then by all means keep moaning, but I know what I'd prefer.",0,1418217421,null,0,false,0,cmqqe6d,t3_2ouy13,t1_cmqqe6d,t3_2ouy13,null,1425506516,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

United have played horrible at times this season and still won. They were utter shite just this week against Southampton but came away with the win. Blessed is the team that always plays well and wins.

&gt; Why does he play a superslow midfield also?

In what sense? Slow in terms of mobility, or in terms of passing the ball? Because again, it's hard for them to pass the ball quickly when there's nobody making runs or who has the pace to encourage them to pass the ball faster. Strikers like Balotelli and Lambert naturally suit a slower buildup, but right now Lambert is overworked and exhausted and when Balotelli plays his decision-making is often poor.

&gt; I want a manager that can adapt to new situations/challenges.. Hope he can learn that but he should've been able to now after over 2 years..

Well shit, did you not watch last season? Because I saw a manager who adapted several ways to using his two best players in their best positions, finding a way to get the most out of our captain and still be able to press in midfield, and switching between 4-3-3 and a diamond midfield as needed. Rodgers *is* more flexible than most managers out there, even if it hasn't looked like it this season. 

Even a manager as experienced and decorated as Van Gaal has gotten off to a slow start at United, given the money he was allowed to spend. Name me your magical manager that adapts to new situations/challenges with super-fast speed.

Justification: Although Kane works better as the second striker; our strongest area is across the AM 3 and we shouldn't be sacrificing them to get Soldado in the team. Kane is our best striker and in reality we're gonna be playing a one striker system for most of the season.

An example - I'm at uni 300 miles away from where I live, and I can either get a train that will take ~5 hours, is usually uncomfortable, there's at least two changes, and it costs £60, or a bus down to London and then up to Cambridge, and get picked up by my parents, taking upwards of 6 hours - or I can simply rag it down the M6 and get home in 3.5 hours in the comfort of my car. It's one specific example, but one that I feel is reflective of the circumstances of most car-using individuals across the country. Rail is inconvenient for those small everyday journeys, buses are shite, and cars are the best mode of transport for everyday life - and it is these 'everyday life' sorts of journeys that are among the most polluting. Therefore, making these 'everyday' journeys run more smoothly as to reduce sub-optimal travel and therefore pollution seems to make the most sense.

Now whether or not Borini takes that is up to him, he could wait it out in the hope that Rodgers gets the sack and a new manager takes to him, or he could wait it out because of the money, or he could go.

I reckon it'll be the latter and we'll see him move to QPR in January, for a lot less than we would have got for him this summer. ",0,1418220030,null,0,false,0,cmqr97q,t3_2ossql,t1_cmqr97q,t3_2ossql,null,1425505996,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

Gosh you weren't kidding about the price but man I bet that would make things easier!

I'm scanning everything at the moment, starting with the older stuff (2004-2011 really at this point) so nothing too hinky can happen if it goes wrong.

God I wish I had a fast scanner - the one I'm using is ok but *slow*. Really it's the software which is holding everything up though - combining and saving everything once scanned etc

 I'm not using OCR at this point, but I may look into it. Right now it just feels much better to have everything scanned and backed up - They're doing nothing sitting in boxes but now I can check anything I need to and I know there are backups too. Especially reassuring with my certificates (exams etc) which I am keeping the hardcopy version of too. Just nice to know there's electronic evidence of these incase something happens there too!

&gt; For backups, have a look at CrashPlan

For instance, the BBFC is an unelected organisation, but their only purpose is to classify media with an age certificate. That's it. They have no say over people's access to the web.

And as soon as you do that, you can start to discuss what *types of porn* are bad, without it needing to affect anything else in wider society, which is what is exactly what's happening.

Myles Jackman, get over yourself you prat. The rest of them, hope they get arrested and have to spend some time in cells with people who suffer from terrible drug addictions so they can see the type of person who ends up having no choice but to go into porn for money in the first place (inb4 ""oh but that woman had a degree so you're wrong, it's not all of them, it's just 99% instead"" Zzzzzzzz ...)

edit: Since this thread is the ultimate circle jerk in more ways than one I won't be around for replies, so here's something else to think about.

In case someone thinks: ""We have to decide what types are bad, do we? Okay, so porn with someone under 18 is bad, but anything else is good. Problem solved. Ha."" *Why* is under 18 bad? It's not just ""cos they're kids."" That's tautological. It's because they're not able to make for themselves reasoned, sane and informed choices about things as fundamental as this. Now how about a drug addict, who we know will do anything, robbing a bank, a person, prostitution, whatever, to get money to take drugs. A properly-functioning society can't protect children for one reason and then simultaneously abrogate the same responsibility towards someone like that, who also isn't able to make a reasoned, sane and informed choice for themselves, just because they're over 18. You might say that's maternalistic, as if that's a bad thing. But earlier you said anyone under 18 shouldn't be doing porn, and we all accept the reasons why. The exact same reason applies here; you can't have it both ways, or pick and choose when you want to care about someone and when not to. It is moral relativism at its worst. People need help, and quite frankly if all they're getting is a rather half-hearted attempt to stop them being coerced into performing (only) the worst degradations in porn (but saying nothing about the normal run-of-the-mill types they'll still have to go through) then honestly it remains a pretty depressing state of affairs as it is and barely any help at all to people who are truly suffering.",0,1418221141,null,0,1418222893,0,cmqro3o,t3_2osfg9,t1_cmqro3o,t3_2osfg9,null,1425505804,-3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-3

&gt; The NAO's figure of £850m was for the initial total estimate which included all the liquidity that the Bank of England poured into the system.


&gt; The government bailed the banks out to the tune of £123.93bn, and at its peak had liabilities for the banking crisis of £1.2 trillion, but the value of its stakes in the biggest banks has plummeted and the interest it is receiving on the loans is relatively small. The interest collected is smaller than that the government pays on its debts, taken out to refinance the banks. 


&gt; The Treasury has pledged to spend £1.2 trillion on the bail-out since the crisis began. But the real outlay has been much smaller. By March it was committed to spending £456.33bn: £123.93bn in loan or share purchases, which required an actual cash injection from the government to the banks, and £332.4bn in guarantees and liabilities.


This money had to be available. Loans taken out, services cut, budgets changed, projects mothballed. We haven't given it *all* to them, but it's presumably kept in reserve and out of the budgets. Now these debts are being paid back but we're talking potentially scales of decades. Meanwhile national debt is massively increased, and the interest on loans the government had to take out to offer to the banks is now billions a year.

How am I the moron for pointing out how much the financial services industry has cost us? You can't just present the tax income and ignore the outlay. Your source states £65bn annually in tax - well that's still seven years to break even on £456bn spending commitments, and at £5bn a year to service the loan, that's another £35bn.

The only thing Suarez really improved on was his conversion rate.  He still took similar numbers of shots, just more of then went in, probably because the setup of the team allowed the shots to be of a higher quality.

false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,"I have heard rumblings that borini picked up a knock a couple weeks ago in training...any confirmation on that or contradicting evidence in training pics? that could explain a lot. 

also i tend to agree with you that people are just looking for someone to blame. it's easy to target rodgers, and rightly so for the team looking so flat, but he made the necessary adjustments at halftime. i think the only gripe i have is him starting enrique to begin with (especially after having a knock eearlier this week). i would have started with moreno and that would have allowed us to bring on marko, can and cou after the interval had we not had to make that change. and i agree, had marko not been sent off, we would have greatly increased our chances of progressing. 

all in all, marko looked a 20m winger last night in his 15 minutes. he was direct, pacey and full of confidence. team was not set up to win in the 1st half, which was good. i thought brendan played that way to mitigate basel coming out hard int he first 15-20 minutes. unlucky that we got beat on a 1-2 by frei and he hammered home a brilliant strike. not brendan's fault on that one, but a player error. you can never be beaten on a 1-2, you are essentially eliminating your self from the play.

i think moving forward, and as weird as this sounds, i think we put all other competitions on the back burner for the season. trophies are far less relevant as top 4 now, so throw all of our eggs in that basket. With that said, i believe we blood all of the new young players in by playing them in europa together. i also agree that we should do that for the cup ties, with capital one cup being a great opportunity (bournemouth) to play some academy stars with some of the younger guys. every opportunity we get to not be humiliated completely, i say we play just youngsters and new guys. save our experienced and best players for league and league only. we need top 4. it is essential. especially considering we didn't get a fair crack at cl or the league so far with sturridge, who probably would have changed the entire season. imagine if we played like we did against tottenham, but for the last 3 months. that's essentially what could have happened. now in hindsight that we know it didn't happen, we need to do everything in our power to beat arsenal and mufc and try to stay in touching distance. once sturridge is back, if we're within 1-2 wins of a top 4 spot, i foresee us going for the jugular. 

anyways, winter transfer i think will consist of borini leaving, glen johnson leaving, lucas and I can see us bringing in a st, a cm/cdm and a gk. i don't think we'll get all three realistically, so most importantly i see us bringing a striker into the fold and selling borini. it will be massively important to bring goals into this team. we are not that bad off once we add goals. the team is a bit soft right now, but who wouldn't be with a shotty confidence spell their in. 

so major summary points: 
1) i would play new players and academy players, exclusively, in all cup ties that are not the prem.

2) i would put all of my eggs in the prem basket, helping to ease the pressure on the guys playing in the cup ties. that will help them to grow and you can start mix and matching them into the prem later in the season. 
 
3) if i were rodgers, i would revert back to the 4-3-3 and try to get the best out of the team that way. or watch simeone, he's a tactical genius.

4) see if fsg will shell out one more time to get corrective adjustments, on bredans terms. make brendan more accountable for the january window and say look, there are x players i want/need. if you give me the power to make these decisions without the committee, i will take the responsibility alone, for better or worse. 

brendan has this half the season to correct everything, so i don't believe sacking him mid season is what's going to change our club. but i do believe if he doesn't get the team to perform post january, he's gone in the summer and we go again.YNWA.",0,1418222007,null,0,false,0,cmqs0m4,t3_2ouwel,t1_cmqs0m4,t1_cmqr5ov,null,1425505488,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

""The new products, Skin Tone Perfecting Serum and Brightening &amp; Protecting SPF 20 Moisturiser, provide the skin with noticeable hydration and a bright, more refreshed look. This is owing to the formulas which have been developed to mitigate the effects of internal and external bioenergy drainers on skin tone, says the brand.

Skin Tone Perfecting Serum is a concentrated serum for targeted use. It has two active ingredients: **Sepiwhite** is a tone-fighting active to manage the production of excess melanin which can lea to dark spots; **and niacinamide** works by reducing visible signs of excess melanin at the surface by increasing cell turnover.

Brightening &amp; Protecting SPF 20 Moisturiser is a broad spectrum, lightweight, fast-absorbing daily moisturiser. It contains **NAG (N-acetyl glucosamine) and niacinamide** which have been shown to reduce excess melanin production in vitro. The moisturiser helps to fade the appearance of dark spots over time to reveal a more even skin tone.""

http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/isps-to-include-porn-filters-as-standard-in-uk-by-2014/


&gt;Internet service providers (ISP) will be expected to provide filtering technology to new and existing customers with an emphasis on opting out, rather than opting in.

&gt;""[In the UK] we will have filters where if you do nothing, the parental filters will come pre-ticked,"" said Perry, speaking at a Westminster eForum on 14 June.

&gt;The move is part of a government effort to force ISPs to make filtering a standard option across industry and to make the technology easier for consumers to use. **As ISPs are voluntarily rolling out filtering technology, it will require no new legislation or regulations.**

It's **optional**. Is the word optional something I've just made up as nobody seems to understand it. It should have been opt-out not opt-in but it's optional. It's also not run by the government.

&gt;**Internet service providers (ISP) will be expected to provide filtering technology**

ISPs. Not the government but ISPs. The government said ""can you please provide parental controls, also please make it opt-in not opt-out"" and the big ISPs went ""Yes ok"". And then 6/7 people opted out of the filters anyway.

We have bought too many mediocre players who will turn to gold given our unique coaching system, yeh right, I bet other clubs have a good laugh at that one.

Some of the people were saying that Suarez  wasn't even going to be that big of a miss, some very prominent posters on this very sub concluded that we would cope well without him. I don't want to shame them.

Saying we were pulling a Spurs during the summer was tantamount to saying my second team is Man Utd. It was quite obvious too many of our signings, while not bad players individually, were not going to repair our failings or in no way supply goals which we would obviously need to replace. 

Where are all these masterminds now? 
Using every well formed little argument  they can muster to butcher the manager. The manager is not blameless but the problems at the club run much deeper than him. 

The club will owe FSG 200million in loans when the money for the stadium expansion is added to the 50 million we already owe them. They said when they bought the club this would never happen under them. There is a difference between leveraging debt to buy a club and an interest free loan to the club's owners but it will still have to be paid. Other owners, such as Chelsea's,  have used mechanisms to absorb these loans off the club, FSG refuse to do this.

The transfer comittee has failed entirely in giving the club the squad required for top four sustainability, wasting so much money on an endless line of mediocre imports. Some cheap, some not so cheap. Who has been a success and who has not is a debate I don't want to get into but in all honesty most of us could count the successful transfers on four fingers or less.

If that's all BR fault then good luck to you but I don't think the problems end at him. It goes so much deeper that it is almost frightening to think our club is being run like this.

I am sorry, but there are many managers in the modern game that would not have this amount of difficulty making this team work. We have some weak points for sure, but how many managers would arrive at a must win Champions League match with only one striker? How many managers would continue to insist that no specialist coaching is needed for a defense that quite clearly has no system? How many managers would continue to force a team that can't effectively build from the back... to build from the back?

Rodgers is a major part of our problem. He needs to drop the ego a bit and start adapting and looking for some help.

I also think that Gerrard has become larger than the club. Now, I don't blame him for wanting to compete every single matchday, that is what players want to do for as long as possible. But, he quite clearly is not good enough for most of our matches these days, and cannot last the 90 minutes we regularly use him for. I have a sinking feeling that if he does sign another contract and he continues to be used in this fashion it will continue to hamper us. We need to be using other players as CDM and AM, and not bowing to a legend simply because he is a legend... the league is different now.

We have a skeleton that has potential, but we need greater flexibility from our manager if we are to succeed going forward. He has abandoned the style of play and formation that had us playing the best football we have played in a decade last season in favor of his dream tactics which the players either don't understand or quite clearly are not capable of implementing. There are a lot of very good players in our squad being used terribly. Rodgers needs to experiment or go.

EDIT: I will add that should some of our supposed ""expensive duds"" leave in the summer, don't be surprised when they go to big clubs and thrive.

One element is how we do in the transfer market and another is how the manager is capable of managing his team once it's assembled.

One fuckup in not getting the right striker can ruin a season but it doesn't necessarily mean they or the squad are a lost cause. It's a short term problem that can be fixed with the right player (1 striker that suits us would help a lot).
If we keep failing to land that player then that's another problem but I don't think underestimating how short we were this season would suggest a pattern of behaviour.

On the other hand, if a manager just can't get the best out of his team then you're can't really move forward. If that's the issue then he needs to be replaced.",0,1418227597,null,0,false,0,cmqunll,t3_2ot16y,t1_cmqunll,t1_cmqtrao,null,1425503999,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I never said that is how we look, if you read the comment properly you would see what I said was I value that over the latter. I'd much rather build towards that than stick around the mediocre level not making the effort to build some cohesion and consistency.

EDIT: On Sherwoods results, if I am being completely honest, I will eat my words and have a conversation with you about this if you find me ONE result which was a surprise (i.e against a side expected to beat us/us not beat them). Sherwoods results on paper are WAY skewed for a PL manager and anyone who's actually looked at them knows that.",0,1418227841,null,0,false,0,cmqus3m,t3_2ouq2k,t1_cmqus3m,t1_cmqu130,null,1425503940,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

false,[deleted],null,null,"&gt; It would be the courts, its their job to determine whether or not someone broke the law. This is all very tricky where best to draw the line, as I've mentioned so I'm not going to come out and say that this is the most practical way of going about it, but having a bill in place that puts the general practice in place and then relying on case law to draw the finer details. Although in the Asher's case it's quite easy as its so explicit.

The problem there is giving the courts the power to police religion. It's really just a vicious circle.

&gt; First of all they didn't refuse service to a gay customer, they refused to make a cake with a political message on it. But this was a stance Asher's chose to make, and it is nobody else's choice what Asher's want to say but theirs.


Ok yeah, fair point on the distinction. But yes, while you're right, it's at odds with the prevailing thought these days of ""live and let live"". It's not that I don't understand Ashers taking a stand - I do. But I think it was the wrong stand to make. If they had made it about the political statement instead of about the underlying issues, it would have been more understandable. They should probably hire you for PR. They said ""We're not making cakes for them because homosexuality is immoral"" instead of ""Politics? We're not fucking stupid, no chance""


&gt; No

Well we agree over something at least

&gt; No, and at this point you're being facetious and redirecting from the point.

Yeah, I do that sometimes.

&gt; Well they're not telling them to stop discriminating against homosexuals at all, indeed have they not dropped the accusations of homophobia, if anyone had went into that shop and ordered a ""support gay marriage"" cake then they would have been told the same thing, quite simply it wasn't on the menu. Why should they have to bite their tongue though? Its not the equality commission's job to silence opposition in debate.

No, it certainly isn't. And certainly they were never told not to express their views. Instead, they let their views guide their customer interaction and this is why the Equality commission got involved. But the greater picture is the issue - where does it stop. It starts with refusing to sell a cake with a gay slogan, but where does it stop? Refusing service to all gay customers without fear of reprise?

&gt; No it isn't, they didn't refuse service on the grounds the individual was gay, and if they did I'd agree it is despicable behaviour.

I was generalising the order as the person, indeed. Fair enough. Yet would it be a logical leap to assume (whether right or wrong) that person was also gay if you were the one taking the order? So I would argue that discrimination is the case here (However possibly tenuous).

&gt; Well they don't stop people at the door and make them fill in a form, because they're not refusing services on the basis of who or what the customer is but on what the customer wants. Now if they were also making cakes that read messages that were pro Islam or Hinduism or any other religious statements then I'd say its hypocritical of them and their religious beliefs.

Yet unusually (as is normally the case in things like this), no-one else has lept on the bandwagon with their own stories. Which suggests this is the first time it's ever occurred. So I stand by suggesting they're cherrypicking.

&gt; Of course I am, why on earth would I want a law were you could be legally obligated to support a cause you don't believe in if you were offered to be paid for it.

Nobody asked them to add ""Supported by Ashers"" on the cake or make a public statement in support of the cause. They're just being obstinate and awkward. If I sell someone an Amnesty International pin at the til, does that mean I support Amnesty? Definitely not.

&gt; Because I like the idea of freedom of speech, I like open debate having the ability to say what I please, and if you don't like it you can argue and debate with me. I do not like the idea of having my beliefs bought.

Fortunately I can debate without thinking the other person is a tosser (Hint: I don't think you're a tosser), and I agree with freedom of speech and open debate. I just find your stance odd, especially with the suggestion of your beliefs being bought. 

&gt; Do you honestly believe that this will be a better place if only certain people are allowed to express their beliefs? If so who decides which people are allowed more freedom than the rest of us?

The courts? I joke.

&gt;  And if so how does that equate with your notion of equality?

Right in the first sentence. 

&gt;The sickening **theory of laissez-faire capitalism** finally died with the recent report 

Laissez-faire capitalism was pushed by Reagan and Thatcher and is a strict set of fundamental ideas on how an economy is run. 

I've already mentioned Thatcher and Reagan so for an ELI5 - privatise everything, incentivise everything with capital and provide little to no regulation of private business.

&gt;Laissez-faire is an economic system in which transactions between private parties are free from intrusive government restrictions, tariffs, and subsidies, with only enough regulations to protect property rights.[1] The phrase laissez-faire is French and literally means ""let [them] do,"" but it broadly implies ""let it be,"" ""let them do as they will,"" or ""leave it alone."" Early advocates of laissez-faire proposed a Impôt unique to replace all taxes that damage welfare by penalizing production.[2]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire

What I find hilarious is that laissez-faire is obviously french which literally means ""let them do"" but it implies ""let them do as they want"". It's capitalism on steroids. ",0,1418228040,null,0,false,0,cmquvxi,t3_2ov95g,t1_cmquvxi,t1_cmquhuy,null,1425503890,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

yesterday he put out 4 slow central midfielders, one of them being oldtimer gerrard as a #10, and paired sterling with lambert. who would have thought they'd mark raheem and the team would be harmless? like i said, it's ambitious that he wants his team to play like spain did at the 2012 euros, but they clearly can't and now liverpool is out of the champions league. his subs were even better, bringing in speed and width but at the same time taking out rickie only whip out crosses to nobody in basel's box, with coutinho and lallana on the bench since the beginning.

I checked OECD webpage and they had this to say

&gt;09/12/2014 - Reducing income inequality would boost economic growth, according to new OECD analysis. This work finds that countries where income inequality is decreasing grow faster than those with rising inequality.

 

&gt;The single biggest impact on growth is the widening gap between the lower middle class and poor households compared to the rest of society. Education is the key: a lack of investment in education by the poor is the main factor behind inequality hurting growth.

 

&gt;“This compelling evidence proves that addressing high and growing inequality is critical to promote strong and sustained growth and needs to be at the centre of the policy debate,” said OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría. “Countries that promote equal opportunity for all from an early age are those that will grow and prosper.”

 

&gt;Rising inequality is estimated to have knocked more than 10 percentage points off growth in Mexico and New Zealand over the past two decades up to the Great Recession. In Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States, the cumulative growth rate would have been six to nine percentage points higher had income disparities not widened, but also in Sweden, Finland and Norway, although from low levels. On the other hand, greater equality helped increase GDP per capita in Spain, France and Ireland prior to the crisis.

 

&gt;The paper finds new evidence that the main mechanism through which inequality affects growth is by undermining education opportunities for children from poor socio-economic backgrounds, lowering social mobility and hampering skills development. 

 

&gt;People whose parents have low levels of education see their educational outcomes deteriorate as income inequality rises. By contrast, there is little or no effect on people with middle or high levels of parental educational background.

 

&gt;The impact of inequality on growth stems from the gap between the bottom 40 percent with the rest of society, not just the poorest 10 percent. Anti-poverty programmes will not be enough, says the OECD. Cash transfers and increasing access to public services, such as high-quality education, training and healthcare, are an essential social investment to create greater equality of opportunities in the long run.

 

The paper also finds no evidence that redistributive policies, such as taxes and social benefits, harm economic growth, provided these policies are well designed, targeted and implemented.

 

&gt;The working paper, Trends in income inequality and its impact on economic growth, is part of the OECD’s New Approaches to Economic Challenges Initiative, an Organisation-wide reflection on the roots and lessons to be learned from the global economic crisis, as well as an exercise to review and update its analytical frameworks.

false,COMPETATIVE_SHITTER,null,null,"I think Dalglish's problem was he tried to change so much and overcomplicated things. When he first came back to the club after the Hodgson debacle, he set us up in a way that to me looked like how Rafa would have utilised that squad. Flash forward to when Dalglish is given significant money in the summer and he added players that changed how we attack, the tactics changed dramatically and it didn't work out. He was probably too far removed from management when he came back to understand how the game had evolved.

I think that's a lot different to what's happened with Rodgers and us this season. Here we've lost our best player, and lets face it, he was the best player in the league by some distance. We knew about him leaving early and we also knew we had to fix the defense and we made signings...

...and those signings have had us in tears and wanting Suarez back so he can save our somehow even more shite defense. This summer was an expensive nightmare for us. So in a way, that's actually pretty similar with what happened in King Kenny's second spell. Too many expensive mistakes and tactical regression.

For me, considering Rodgers' tenure as a whole, I find it perfectly acceptable for people to be questioning whether or not he's the man for us. None of us will ever know how much of last season was down to Suarez being a wizard or Rodgers building the team around him almost perfectly. What we do know is Suarez was key to last season. We also know he was let go without an adequate replacement. We also know we didn't strengthen our Achilles' heel that cost us the title last season, our golden ticket season... our shite defense.

We attempted to fix these problems, but what looks like what has happened is we've spent a lot of money to make our current problems worse and a lot was ""invested into the future."" Considering Rodgers' trips into the transfer market, how many can we say have been good signings? Sturridge easily, Coutinho for sure even though he doesn't have Sturridge's consistency, and then I'd argue Joe Allen is a good signing for us (though I know some would disagree). After that... a lot of underpar players many of whom we paid way too much for.

After a season where a title race left us feeling happy and then sad at the end (when before the season nobody would have predicted the ride we were in for), this season has hit a lot of us hard.

For me personally, I honestly don't know what to think. Last season Rodgers impressed me with his tactical flexibility. We shifted the shape of the midfield a lot last season, a number of times massive changes in shape came mid-match that would paper over some of our weaknesses and help us get the ball to Sturridge and Suarez who would then make us very very happy. This season Rodgers has shown such inflexibility and stubbornness that I'm not even sure it's the same person.

I'm at a crossroads. I want Rodgers to be able to turn this around, I want to believe in him because of what I saw last season. I also am terrified of letting him spend more money and recent performances have me thinking that last season was mostly down to the genius of Suarez.",0,1418228672,null,0,false,0,cmqv7vk,t3_2ot16y,t1_cmqv7vk,t1_cmqmbyz,null,1425503735,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

It just seems like relentless marketing to me. They almost definitely spend more on marketing than on developing the game. That probably isn't that uncommon now but I'd guess PES is the opposite.

Also find the same thing with Samsung phones atm. Their build quality is pretty shit but Samsung is practically synonymous with Android among the equally ill informed that actually think FIFA is a good game.

The sad thing is that there are so many examples of this where capitalism isn't really winning. Misinformation and marketing are. The backlash tends to happen, but as long as it's a minority then they'll continue to fuck everything up.

FIFA packaging could literally give people diseases and they'd probably continue to make enough to make it worth their while. It annoys me how little people care about how they spend their money now. Personally think it has a lot to do with upbringing now too.

And fuck free to play whilst we're at it. And all the games with free pre-order levels. We've probably reached a point where marketing is too clever and people are too stupid or ignorant to care.

this is the big one for me, we're not professional football managers something we all bring up in arguments against each other all the time on this sub - but even we have been talking about the flaws and holes in the team for months now, well before the transfer window opened.

Our transfer comitee since rodgers took over has been VERY shit, we did well on a few players (I think the young players u23 should be excluded from criticisms because they are long term investments) but even then Sturridge is always injured, coutinho form is a rollcoaster of emotions, Lallana nevers plays enough, Sakho is a weird issue, Balotelli is all controversy no goals, Lovren is more often than not shocking, ect ect.

Its easy with Hind sight but looking back the majority of the transfers have all been well below par and i believe this above all else if a big reason our team is in trouble",0,1418229347,null,0,false,0,cmqvl12,t3_2ov3ir,t1_cmqvl12,t3_2ov3ir,null,1425503565,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

&gt;**A letter sent to the UK's four leading ISPs from the government** has made them very cross indeed. So cross that someone in the industry has passed it to me - you can read it in full below.

&gt;The letter comes from the Department for Education but it sets out a list of demands from Downing Street, with the stated aim of allowing the prime minister to make an announcement shortly. The companies are asked, among other things, for a commitment to fund an ""awareness campaign"" for parents. They're not particularly happy about promising cash for what the letter concedes is an ""unknown campaign"" but it's the next item on the menu which is the **source of most of their anger**.

&gt;This asks them to change the language they are using to describe the net safety filters they will be offering to internet users. Instead of talking of ""active choice +"", they are urged to use the term default-on.

The government had plenty to do with the current affair with the filters of the ISPs.

I'm sure you'll like to hide behind the whole ISP one provide the filters and the lists &amp; government doesn't have anything do with the list.

&gt;In ""[Victory of the Daleks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_of_the_Daleks)"" (2010) five examples of a new Dalek variant are introduced, described in the narrative as forming ""a new Dalek [paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm)"". They are created from pure Dalek DNA contained in a device called a 'Progenitor'.  Their design is the result of input from *Doctor Who* executive producer [Steven Moffat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Moffat), production designer Edward Thomas, ""Victory of the Daleks"" writer [Mark Gatiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Gatiss) and concept artist Peter McKinstry.

Really good points, but that's probably because I believe the club has failed spectacularly in dealing with the loss of Suarez. That belief was just a faint notion when we signed Lambert. But it became a feeling of dread when we lost Alexis Sanchez to Arsenal, steadily grew as we signed a handful of *potential* replacements and was finally confirmed when it became clear that our solution to replacing Suarez was Mario Balotelli, on sale. 

&gt; Saying we were pulling a Spurs during the summer was tantamount to saying my second team is Man Utd.

This made me a little crazy. Losing a top 5 player like Suarez (or Bale) and replacing him with a handful of potential stars like Lallana (or Lamela), Markovic (or Soldado) and Can (or Eriksen) has certain risks. And it's not unheard of for one team to have a similar experience as another team when they go about their business in a very similar way. In fact, it might even be expected, since imitating something usual gives similar results.

I hate to be that guy but I'm just gonna say it: we are pulling a Spurs, hard.

Anyone who disagrees with me should take a close look at the premier league table. Kinda weird, huh? It doesn't help that our leading scorer has all but 2 of his goals from open play (remember laughing about Penaldado?) or that our second leading scorer is own goal. It was during last month's abysmal run of losses that I thought to myself ""holy hell, we look like Tottenham"". Ironically the only time we've looked liked ourselves this season was when we played Spurs at White Hart Lane.

And since I'm already ranting... we should have done more to get Sanchez in a swap for Suarez. Look how he is carrying that team right now, everything he gives on the pitch. It fucking kills me that Arsenal are above us in the table and still playing in Champions league solely because of that guy. And if we couldn't get Alexis, we should have put all of our resources towards finding the best replacement possible, which is why we heard that ridiculous list of names during silly season.

As history shows she went out on a lie, a big one, (trickledown-economics) that has damaged this nation to this day (and continues to do so), demonised the organisations protecting the rights of working men and women of the nation, and sold off the nations assets to finance it.

The killer? ...

**She chose Jimmy Savile as a close personal friend** (having him to stay with her and Denis at Christmas on more than 10 occasions), it was common knowledge around the BBC and entertainment circles that he was an active pederast, paedophile, and necrophiliac; are we somehow supposed to believe that if the entire Beeb were gossiping about those facts, that the security services were unaware? If the security services knew (and they certainly did) so did Maggie (and Denis).

None of these guys aside form Remy are of a similar player type to Suarez though, so it would have still been a big change at the top in terms of style.

That is one hell of an assumption to make. I wouldn't be surprised if that's partially the case. But the fact that Ade was frozen out by AVB and he was the star man under Sherwood makes me think that he cant play in a system that demands too much of him (old, lazy, whatever.) Sherwood merely demanded that he score goals, which Ade did. I think that's why he excelled, not because he wanted to ""get back"" at AVB. This is a professional footballer we're talking about.

Sorry I guess I misunderstood this part, but then why bring it up in the first place? I get that the latter part is how we played with Sherwood, but the former is (as you have said) not how we play with Poch, or even AVB. So its comparing apples to oranges I think. 

You're right tho, we're here to talk about Spurs and no one should be out to get anyone else. I'm sorry if I came off as a dick in my last post, really wasn't my intention. cheers

&gt;Until you want to use it with OXML documents. Whether Microsoft are abusing their monopoly or not the Microsoft formats are the de-facto standard of the business world and if you can't interoperate with what everyone else uses you have failed.

Office OXML documents aren't even fully compatible across versions so any argument of 'Microsoft is super for interoperability' is a half truth at best. These are standards Microsoft themselves wrote. If they can't be bothered to stick to their own standards, why should anyone else?

&gt;""objectively"" I don't think you know what that word means.

I can use a dictionary, thank you.
