false,kettlewell1,null,null,"Long term Brit viewer's perspective: I was born in 1971, when Doctor Who had been running already for eight years. My earliest memory of TV is Dr Who in 1974, and I've been watching ever since. Of course in those even pre-VHS days there was no going back, and very few reruns in the UK (it was different in the US where Dr Who was rerun often on many PBS stations) - you just started watching in whatever era you were born into. And so Dr Who became a generational experience.

So there's something to be said for the idea of just watching the most recent 2014 series, beginning with episode 1, **Deep Breath**, as an experiment if nothing else. I like the idea of jumping in to how the show is right now without preconceptions, just as earlier generations did. Also the BBC Sherlock is on your list, and you may or may not be aware the two shows currently share a showrunner/lead writer (Steven Moffat), so is likely to appeal if you like the writing. Moffat has written for every season since 2005, but only became lead writer and showrunner in 2010.

Starting with **Rose**, episode one of the 2005 revival, which was specifically designed to appeal to new audiences, has become an almost standard recommended route, and I would also endorse it. Personally I prefer RTD's dialogue to Moffat's on the whole, so if you like exceptional dialogue I would say 2005 has the edge over 2014 imho.

Your list of favourite shows looks like a mix of styles and themes almost all of which find echoes in Doctor Who over half a century. so that's promising. I'd be surprised if you don't find something to like. Once you grasp the fundamentals (&amp; the 2005 season really does feel precision-designed to achieve that), you can sample any previous era to get a more rounded impression of the show.

As for 20th century Dr Who then, you're right that beginning with **An Unearthly Child**, which is episode one, season one 1963, and trying to catch-up chronologically probably isn't especially sustainable. That's not to say that that single episode isn't a rather fascinating and beautiful 25 minutes of television in it's own right, fairly remarkable work for the time, setting up the characters and USP efficiently and atmospherically. Worth a watch to compare with a more recent episode.

Also from the 20th century, I think Robert Holmes wrote astonishing dialogue for Doctor Who, so anything by him will be worth listening to.
Inspired by your list I think you might enjoy 1975's **Pyramids of Mars** as a standalone.",0,1418096828,null,0,1418097416,0,cmpeoxu,t3_2ooqwh,t1_cmpeoxu,t3_2ooqwh,null,1425531110,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

Nobody has said that here but you.

&gt;saying that those differences can define a person and do anything more than exert a modicum of influence is utterly absurd

Really?  Based on what do you dismiss it as ""absurd?""  You can't just do a politically correct finger-wave and make the differences in the hippocampus and amygdala, or the different proportions of white vs gray matter, just to name a few differences, and just say it's ""absurd"" to think these physical differences likely result in behavioral, cognitive, and emotional differences.  These differences exist, and I'll need a little more than your dismissive pronouncement of ""absurd"" before I ignore them.

&gt;To use a common quote with regard to genetics – 'genes are not destiny'.

Nobody is saying that.  Nobody is taking it that far.

But the idea that genes or sex is irrelevant is an outdated notion with no basis in reality.

&gt;There is no reason whatsoever that the Doctor couldn't be female – intellect, wit, and a strong desire to do good are by no means exclusively male traits

Wit?.. There must be a reason there's so few female comedians.  [Christopher Hitchens argues an evolutionary reason.](http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/01/hitchens200701)

Rather than argue women do not or can not have the traits characteristic of the Doctor, I would instead say the Doctor is a role model for the traits we most admire in men.  Does that mean women can not be leaders, warriors, scientists, sacrificial, protective, witty, courageous, etc?  Of course not.  But these are traits that, for better or worse, are not as prized in women.  They are prized in men as the ideal virtues.  Women are prized more for their abilities to empathize and care for others; traits Doctor 12 in particular is usually painfully lacking.

I would also argue that there is a dire lack of good male role models on TV.  Note, I said ""good.""  There's plenty of male role models, but most are steroid induced raging mountains of muscle and little else.  On TV men are either idiots completely lost without the guidance of a woman, or they're steroid beast or emotionless badass, or a complete loser.  Oh, or a hornball.  There's few noble men on TV who are intelligent, courageous, witty, charming, sacrificial, et al.

The Doctor is a role model for boys and men.  Ladies, want a lady role model?  Go make one.  Don't hijack the Doctor and pretend something has been accomplished.

As a black man, I'd love to see more black action heroes.  But I'd feel like we were simply being tossed a bone if James Bond was suddenly portrayed by a black man.

false,L41r,null,null,"&gt; Nobody has said that here but you.

No, but saying that the Doctor's characterisation is inherently male carries that implication. 

&gt;Really? Based on what do you dismiss it as ""absurd?"" You can't just do a politically correct finger-wave and make the differences in the hippocampus and amygdala, or the different proportions of white vs gray matter, just to name a few differences, and just say it's ""absurd"" to think these physical differences likely result in behavioral, cognitive, and emotional differences. These differences exist, and I'll need a little more than your dismissive pronouncement of ""absurd"" before I ignore them.

Based on the fact that my friend, according to neurogenetic markers, should have very violent impulses. Based on the fact that I should, according to neurogenetic markers, be very incredibly different from the way I am. Based on the fact that twins with identical genetics can be very different people with polar opposite tastes. It is absurd to say that there cannot be a woman with the same personality as the Doctor. As for common behavioral differences, unfortunately our modern society is one so tainted by ideas of gender roles that it is literally impossible to conduct an experiment with which to establish a causal link, so you *cannot* correctly assert that such common differences are attributable to nature as opposed to nurture.

&gt;Nobody is saying that. Nobody is taking it that far. But the idea that genes or sex is irrelevant is an outdated notion with no basis in reality.

Except that's exactly what's being implied – that sex dictates personality. I never said sex was irrelevant, and it certainly has a modicum of influence. However, to say that it defines the personalities of people or constrains them it an utterly absurd assertion with no basis in reality. 

&gt;Wit?.. There must be a reason there's so few female comedians. Christopher Hitchens argues an evolutionary reason.

The thing about his theory is that it's just that – a theory based on nothing but conjecture, and in our current society, there is no way that he could possibly provide evidence for it due to the inextricable confounding variable that is stereotypical gender roles. However, and this can be taken with a grain of salt as it is purely anecdotal, I doubt it's a coincidence that in my experience, women from older generations tend to be less 'funny' than ones of younger generations – indeed, all of my friends are witty, and most are women.

&gt;Rather than argue women do not or can not have the traits characteristic of the Doctor, I would instead say the Doctor is a role model for the traits we most admire in men. Does that mean women can not be leaders, warriors, scientists, sacrificial, protective, witty, courageous, etc? Of course not. But these are traits that, for better or worse, are not prized in women. They are prized in men as the ideal virtues.

And here's where there's a problem – the fatalism of your statement, as if there's no way that can change or, indeed, as if that hasn't already changed a considerable amount. You're acknowledging a problem of modern society – the problem of stereotypical gender roles, albeit viewing it as a bit more dire than it is, but instead of thinking that this is a great opportunity to contribute to changing that, you're throwing up your hands in defeat.

&gt;I would also argue that there is a dire lack of good male role models on TV. Note, I said ""good."" There's plenty of male role models, but most are steroid induced raging mountains of muscle and little else. On TV men are either idiots completely lost without the guidance of a woman, or they're steroid beast or emotionless badass, or a complete loser. Oh, or a hornball. There's few noble men on TV who are intelligent, courageous, witty, charming, sacrificial, et al.

And that's an issue with traditional gender roles being enforced in the media. But I do not see how having the Doctor regenerate into a female incarnation would, by any stretch of the imagination, invalidate the 50-some odd years prior in which the Doctor was male. Indeed, in enforcing that the core traits of the Doctor transcend barriers, it'd be definitively and undeniably providing a good role model for all. 

&gt;The Doctor is a role model for boys and men. Ladies, want a lady role model? Go make one. Don't hijack the Doctor and pretend something has been accomplished.

Last I checked, the Doctor is a role model for *everyone*. I'm sorry if I missed some memo or sign on the treehouse saying 'no girls allowed', and I guess I'll tell a good number of my friends to pack up their bags and go home since the character that has been such a good role model for them isn't one after all. Granted, most people are generally drawn to role models of the same gender, but that does not mean that role models cannot transcend gender. Indeed, your implication that changing the Doctor's form from a white male form into something else constitutes 'hijacking' is rather ridiculous, as it implies an inherent inability to find a role model in the unalike, not just a predisposition toward finding it easier to find role models in the alike.",0,1418103400,null,0,false,0,cmphqzq,t3_2oo4pv,t1_cmphqzq,t1_cmph3vj,null,1425529684,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

But otherwise agreed, he's useful in two positions - when the opposition defence is set up, he will play in that inside forward position as Gerrard is already occupying the hole (as happened against Ludo). 

When on the transition high press he will be more of a winger (sticking to his flank) and when countering, he will be more of a a support striker - trying to draw defenders and/or feed Lambert - or a runner, trying to get in behind the defence with 1-2s or through balls from others.

On this page there are the average positions against Ludo: http://ohyoubeauty.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/visualized-liverpool-2-2-ludogorets.html

You can see Sterling averaging out to an inside forward. 

Anfield Index supports our views that we had a few formations going. I disagree with the Sterling and Lambert up top as a strike pair but if you drop him off, put in on the left and label him like you did as inside forward, then it's all spot on.

false,patriciastar,null,null,"My partner and I have just recently gone through the process of setting up a bank account and getting a phone number in the UK as a foreign national. Based on our experiences, most of the advice given in this thread will not help you right now. Legislation has been changed quite recently to make it much more difficult for foreign nationals to get things like a bank account and place to live in the UK (a response to issues of money laundering apparently). We have moved over to the UK from Australia. I have a job offer but my partner does not (this has affected our ability to get bank accounts). We have a contact address in the UK (my brother lives here) but no 'proof of address' (i.e. utility statements from that address, bank statements sent to that address). Having a contact address in the UK is helpful for getting your National Insurance Number set up. So if you have any family/friends in the UK, ask to use their address to have some mail sent to.

Here is my advice for getting set up in the UK as a foreign national:

Phone: We tried going to Three and getting a sim-only plan, as we knew we wouldn't have enough evidence (proof of address, bank account) for a contract. However, we were told that even for a sim-only plan now, you need that same kind of evidence (proof of address, bank account). So Three couldn't help us at all. We went to Vodafone instead and they gave us a pre-paid SIM. I recommend you do the same (get a prepaid sim to start with - the choice of carrier is up to you).

Bank Account: We spoke with HSBC, Barclays and LLoyds about setting up a bank account with them. All the banks have different requirements for what you need to set up an account. HSBC used to do a passport account whereby foreign nationals could set up a basic bank account using just their passport - and this account is still advertised on their website. However, we spoke to someone at HSBC in person and they said they no longer offer the passport account. Barclays requires proof of address to set up a bank account, and has quite long wait times (we were quoted 2-3 weeks) to arrange an appointment with them to set up a bank account. We couldn't go with Barclays as we didn't have proof of address.  We ended up going with Lloyds. Lloyds gave me a 'current account' based on my passport and the fact that I had a job offer. Lloyds would only give my partner a basic account as he didn't have a job offer. In short: Go to Lloyds, arrange an appointment to set up a bank account, bring along your passport and proof of your job offer, and they will give you an account.

National Insurance Number: Apply for this ASAP. We applied for this on the first day that we arrived. Go to a job centre plus, and they will probably give you a phone number that you need to ring. You have to answer some basic questions about your visa and you need to provide a contact address in the UK. They will then send you a form that you need to fill out and send back with photocopies of your passport and visa. The whole process can take several weeks. Get started on this ASAP. The National Insurance Number letter is useful as proof of address.

There does seem to be an element of whoever you talk to at different banks, estate agents, etc will give you a different answer. However, everyone that we talked to across the board mentioned the recent tightening of legislation and the fact that it is now much harder to get set up in this country. 

I recommend that on the day that you arrive, you immediately go to a phone store and buy a pre-paid sim card. Then - if you have a contact address in the UK - go to a job centre plus and ask for the phone number to call for a National Insurance Number. Call that number ASAP - make sure you have your passport, visa, phone number and UK contact address with you. Then go to Lloyds and ask to book an appointment to create an account. Explain your situation to them. Go to your eventual Lloyds bank appointment with proof of your job offer, your passport and your visa.

Some of this will be harder to achieve if you don't have a contact address in the UK. If you get stuck, see if your place of employment can help you out.

Best of luck! PM me if you have any other questions. We are still in the process of getting sorted - still waiting on our National Insurance Numbers, and haven't found a place to live yet.

I have to tell you, I think the only reason they are talking about gender right now is because fans haven't really been having that conversation lately. Except when pointing out the very clear, very repetitive message that has been laid on pretty thick as of late. Mind you, RTD put sexuality into Doctor Who but what made it amazing was that his version of sexuality had class. It wasn't put there to shock us or start a conversation. When it comes to sexuality Whovians have long since already had that conversation. RTD put sexuality in a way where nothing was needed to be said. It was just the appreciation of something different. I mean Sky Silvestry was so scared of her ex, some unknown woman, who said ""She said she'd get me"" right before she gets taken over by some entity. Domestic abuse in same sex relationships is a conversation that we should be having actually, and not that same-sex relationships exist. Or that gender is fluid. Obviously we get that. Stating that you are in a same-sex relationship in different ways over and over and over again feels forced and honestly very rude. Or this ""new"" idea of gender fluidness among Galifreyans. They are obviously wanting to come out with a female Doctor. This is just them trying to pamper the idea. Cause its an idea that could potentially kill the entire franchise if not done right. Honestly I really think Moffat should not be tackling this one. I don't think he should be the one to bring in a female Doctor.The female master honestly wasn't that great.

Are we just suppose to be pretend that didn't happen? The Doctors greatest fear is the crack? Really? Somehow I just don't believe it. The Silence are actually priests of some religion? Ok I guess I can buy it. Do the Daleks remember the Doctor or don't they? While we are on the subject I remember the first versions of Heaven being all bright, sunny and white. Why is Danny Pinks version so dystopian? Look it's obvious there are problems. It's like ideas are created and just left to die over and over again. Continuity is off too.

Weirdly, our team (if healthy) is almost perfectly set up to play a 3-5-3.  Jan and Kaboul play the right/left sides very well, especially considering they have the ability to play RB/LB.  Vlad fits the central CB role quite well.   Rose and Walker give width.  Lamela and Eriksen take up the positions behind the striker, while Dembele and Chadli operate the midfield.

false,Rohaq,eng-Cambridgeshire,Cambridgeshire,"It's a resulting mindset of being really fucking poor: ""Better spend it while I have it"". Better to buy a luxury while you can afford it - because money goes so quickly - and if you don't spend it while you are mildly flush, you won't get *any* luxuries, and everybody wants a small sliver of happiness out of their lives, rather than to constantly live the life of a pauper. Better struggle along with the occasional luxury, than to scrimp and get no luxuries and only be £30 up a month for it.

Being really fucking poor also doesn't lend itself to the ""I should save up my money"" mindset. After all, what are you going to spend £30 a month on otherwise? You aren't going to be able to save for a house deposit on that kind of extra dough - chances are anything you do save will be eaten up by something else anyway - if you don't spend it now, it will be gone, and you'll probably have nothing to show for it. It's easier and more regularly rewarding just to have a small glimpse of happiness in your life in a bag of chips and a few tins of cheap beer.

Which is why I can understand why him and his wife go for a payday takeaway and a few alcoholic drinks - yes, that's £30-odd between them, but it's likely the only time of the month that they can actually afford something that cheers them up, and doesn't make them feel like shit about their lives - they aren't going to be in the saving mindset with only an extra £30 a month to show for it.

That said, the TV... I'm also assuming he probably bought the £1,500 TV through a pay monthly credit plan, since it came from a catalogue, and is probably paying extra for that privilege. Hell, he's probably offset that monthly cost against his monthly income already. Or he got a windfall of some sort and since the mindset is ""Better spend it while I have it"", decided to treat himself by blowing it all at once. Not great, but it shows that mindset in effect.

Though even I couldn't justify spending that much on a TV right now, and I'm earning decent money - I didn't always though, I used to live paycheck to paycheck, and I can guarantee that once I got my monthly basics paid off (rent, bills, food, etc.), anything more usually got spent on some kind of small treat. I don't even regret it; the money I was on 8 years ago was laughable compared to how much I make now, considering my living expenses haven't really gone up all that much: I can save the same amount in less than 2 months at this point that would have taken me two years before. That's two years without doing anything fun, or going to the pub, or takeaways, for the sake of saving a tiny amount of money that would have bought me sweet fuck all, at the expense of actually being able to enjoy what little extra I had worked hard to earn. Bollocks to that.

Nowadays, I enjoy a few luxuries (nicer luxuries, even!), safe in the knowledge that I can afford them, but since saving actually has a light at the end of the tunnel, unsurprisingly, I also save my money where I can, because for one, I'm not having to suffer in order to do so, and two, I can actually save a substantial amount each month, and it may actually lead to good things happening, like finally being able to afford a house deposit.",0,1418109178,null,0,false,0,cmpjrsg,t3_2on3uf,t1_cmpjrsg,t1_cmoq9q5,null,1425528740,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Have a couple of pints before you head in, you won't be pissed, but it'll losen your tongue. Chelsea shirts aren't optional, most people won't be wearing them, and if you want to head out later, there isn't a club in London which will let you in wearing one (same with trainers). Having said that, go and buy a shit load of stuff from the store, or better that give the money straight to the club. It makes you much more attractive to the opposite sex. 

Fulham isn't exactly hardcore when it comes to pubs, in terms of getting a decent pint with a decent, normal pub atmosphere, as a tourist I'd head to the Anglesea Arms, the Alma Tavern, or if you're looking for a sloanier place than feel free to drop into the White Horse or The Imperial. Its probably best to avoid the slug, the Broadway (or whatever it's called now), Brogans or weatherspoons because they're shit dives and chain pubs.

Once upon a time, buses had no space for prams, meaning you *had* to collapse them. Magically people managed to deal with this like adults without throwing tantrums or whining like little babies. Now everyone else is supposed to bend over backwards for the handful of idiots who live in a bubble of them and their kid being the only things that matter in the world. 

  To cite an extreme example, I once took an hour-long busride where this kid in a pushchair screamed at the top of his lungs for close to the entire trip. He wasn't crying, or just miserable, but properly screaming at full volume. His idiot mother did a grand total of fuck-all to actually do anything about it, but sat there whinging on her mobile phone about her kid. Polite requests to deal with her kid went unheeded. Eventually I ended up losing my temper, if anything because the kid was drowning everyone out, taking the phone from her, turning it off and telling her, to her face, quite firmly that she could either get off the bus and stop being so damn selfish, or she could actually try doing something about the screaming. Magically two minutes later the screaming stopped and everyone else didn't develop a migraine. 

I know not all parents of children, particularly young ones, are like this, but it's sometimes a little difficult to have any sympathy when you get situations like these.

That's a pretty complex question.

Median income is a bit over £20k so in theory anything up to that could be funded by taxing the rich and giving to the poor. In theory thats how communist societies were supposed to work, with everyone getting the median.

No one wants that and one of the draws of BI is that it would liberate entrepreneurship from people who are currently poverty trapped.

The reason this proposed BI offers a low figure is to gain traction. It seems very reasonable to switch to UBI when UBI only costs 0.04% more. It's a much harder sell to switch to a UBI that's funded by higher top rate income tax or a land value tax.

Regarding wage inflation nothing in this proposal is going to end the availability of minimum wage labour. People who can work for £10k a year now are going to keep their jobs when offered £10k + £3.5k BI rather than chuck the job to just live on the BI.

Asda was the nearest to me, and their SmartPrice range is *very* cheap. The same is similar to most other supermarkets.

Peanut Butter &gt; Margarine (SmartPrice Lard isn't very nice on toast) &gt; lemon curd

Instant Soups were tasty, and tins of veg were cheap - I remember buying a tin of peas for £0.09.

Luis is better on the ball going forward but he can also turn off that switch that keeps pulling Azpi back every single time he goes forward. Its not a problem, Ashley Cole was like that too.


If you look at how Bale was in his full back years, how Baines is or how Vertonghen is. They can switch off that switch and at times forget to defend but they provide a steady presence upfeont as a result.


This is why I think that even though Azpi is better, Luis should be playing from minute 1 against sides against which we need to attack from the get go. Azpi is a big match player who needs good attackers coming at him to utilize his immense skill. Then he goes upfront and does something too but mostly its rendered useless against small teams as Hazard is left to dry after which Fabregas gravitates to him, then Oscar then Hazard comes down the middle and we are again playing in a straight line.

But hey, *just* climbing Snowdon is fine...

I'd go from there up to Blackpool and eventually the Lake district. If hillwalking is your thing, then I don't see how you can cut the Lake District out, quite frankly.

You'd want to make arrangements with people who do need to call you to use your mobile number instead or arrange a day when you can be contacted (or when you plug in the phone to use yourself) and expect such calls with your landline plugged in.

The tech solutions do exist but can get a bit pricey if you google them eg programming which numbers are acceptable and which go straight to VM. I don't know if there's an open-source solution lurking out there; could be an interesting project!

Even applying for the TPS won't make a huge difference as your number will get passed around multiple databases.

For example if you took out insurance with say a sky dish, then that would make your number rank way up databases associated with cold-calling and selling if you bought over the phone! So whatever has happened sounds analogous to that with the charity sector.

If it's your mobile, just a get a new number and pass it out sparingly or keep the old sim and use that number for bs stuff you sometimes need to provide a contact number for that's bound to wing it's way into those  telesales databases and keep your main sim for personal contacts only.

false,Girlwithnousername,null,null,"Yeah, loads of gigs and one festival (not camping). I have lots of friends who go to both and sometimes I just can't be bothered to find out who is going or to get someone to come along; also, varying tastes can make things difficult. 

If you are nervous about going alone, quite often if you buy a ticket on scarletmist.co.uk (which is a fan to fan website that only sells spares at cost) people there offer for you to come along with them if you want to. Well, sometimes anyway. So that's one way to find someone to go with if you want to.

As a general rule I find gig-goers to be quite sociable and most people are welcomed, so it doesn't surprise me that scarlet misters say 'come along with us if you like, or just buy the ticket from me.'

There are some distinct advantages to going alone: 

- You get to choose the date, seated or standing

- You get to decide whether to see the support bands - quite often with friends we'll have differing opinions on support and I or they have to stand through a bunch of support bands we don't particularly like

- You don't have to buy expensive rounds at the bar

- If you want to get closer to the stage, stand at the back or at the sides, it's easier

- If you're surrounded by arseholes or a bunch of loud talkers, it's easier to move away if you're not stood waiting for a mate who's taking 20 minutes at the bar (because queues are usually awful)

- I get to go to everything I want to rather than just some of the things I want to

- If the band are terrible, I can walk out with no feeling of guilt about either having to drag a friend out or leaving them there alone

- I don't have to put up with friends being silly levels of pissed (which, admittedly, doesn't happen often, but when it does, it can be a bit annoying)

At most gigs there are usually a bunch of people standing at the back or along the sides who are there on their own, most of whom will be open to banter before the gig starts/in between support bands etc; so it's possible to meet people quite easily at gigs.*

The best night of my life was at a gig on my own. The music blew me away; no friends were available so I went on my own. No regrets about ever going to a gig on my own. I've also been to gigs alone abroad.

Festival wise I've only been to Rock en Seine alone and that was absolutely fine too. I enjoyed wandering around on my own, and when the crowd started to talk through my favourite band and piss me off, I just went to the bar/sought entertainment elsewhere, rather than being stuck there getting increasingly irate at the nerve of people talking through MY band :)

Do it dude. A million times do it.

Either way, his point about ""sending a message"" is not really valid, because the message the government is currently sending is that they are not in touch with the populace on this issue and that they are ignoring the scientific facts.

In general I think a huge proportion of those who have strong opinions against more liberal drug policies are probably people who haven't had much contact with drugs.

He said he never did drugs, which makes me lose respect for his opinion on this matter. If he has never had contact with them or people who do them, why does his opinion hold any water?

I don't understand his view on this topic. Either he's going for a tactical opinion on the issue or he doesn't understand it. Neither is good. Considering the platform he's on and the lip service he's paying to the views of young people, it's a bit questionable.

Other than that one issue, he's pretty on point.

use the proper charger especially on something as 'dumb' electronics wise as an ecig battery. examples follow.

* Iphone charger outputs 1000Ma
* ipad charger outputs 2100Ma
* kindle charger is about 850Ma
* samsung galaxy charger 700Ma

see the danger here ? plug your egig into anything else other than what was intended and your going to have 'issues' this rings true of ALL chargers.

When construction halted and there was low demand, they wanted brick layers for a cheap as possible and went for cheap foreign workers. Low wages meant existing bricklayers changed careers and new bricklayers weren't trained. 

An industry should ensure they're using local workers as much as possible to ensure there's always a strong core supply. Foreign workers should only be used when there's an over-abundance of work.

However, some people are forced to give up due to the boom and bust economy which makes it so there's almost no work every ten years or so, then there's the back, knee and wrist injuries which can end your career in the trade prematurely, plus the alcoholism and stress of just being a builder puts some out the game too.

Of course those staff who might have made the choice not to attend on ""moral"" grounds would be homophobes and the company would be wrong to pander to them, but it would be equally wrong for them to bring those people somewhere they objected to without informing them beforehand. 

You could argue that they should just have avoided the place altogether, but then isn't that just pandering to the homophobes right from the outset? 

We will never know what the company would have done with the information or how they would have dealt with their (possibly hypothetical) homophobic employees, because the bar owner responded like a total prick and didn't give them the benefit of the doubt.

The day light hours here in Scotland (Edinburgh) are 8am to 2:30/3pm (It will be dark, not just sunset at 3pm).  At Fort William, they will be even less.  That is not enough hours to climb Nevis and return within a day.  Snow is heavy and winter storms have hit.  Do not attempt to climb Nevis unless you are very experienced (and as you are asking it sounds like you are not).  Nevis is a difficult enough climb for an inexperienced person during the warm summer months.  Do not even think about risking it.

Do not put a mountain rescue teams life in danger by attempting to climb.  I strongly advise again attempting Snowdonia as well, given that you seem to be very inexperienced.

People die each year doing what you are thinking about doing.  **Don't risk it.**

Edit.  You shouldn't have too much trouble driving in Scotland during winter.  But locals know what roads to take and what to avoid.  Many roads in the highlands become impassible, and the snow gates will be shut.  Drifts can get into the metres.  To get north you would be forced into taking coastal A roads or potentially the A9, although even the A9 closes, and often becomes extremely slow moving due to frequent accidents and the nature of it being single lane.

You've made if sound as if Fearless class was decommissioned with no replacement. 

The Navy still have ships capable of similar operations, including HMS Ocean and more comparably the Albion class landing platforms (aka Assault ships.), which were commissioned as the replacement to Fearless class.

Arguably HMS Ocean is more capable in that role alone than both HMS Fearless and Intrepid were as a class, providing a landing platforms for far more helicopters and capable of holding a far larger landing force. 


&gt;So do we have anything to throw at the Argies? 

Yes, plenty. 

Having an aircraft carrier is less of an issue when air superiority isn't even in question. 

The Argentine Air Force is made up of a turboprop driven counter insurgency aircraft, 33 A-4AR aircraft (36 converted, 3 crashed.) which are essentially an aircraft designed half a century ago that's been tarted up. And some Mirage 3's which were an absolute disaster when used in the Falklands war, only entering combat once and subsequently being shot down by guess who? The Argentine air force. 

Even if the entire Argentine combat capable air force was thrown at the islands, which would obviously be a logistical impossibility, the Type 45 air defence destroyer, Reaper battery and the 4 Typhoons that are stationed there would put up a very good fight. 

There is also a 1200 man garrison at Mount Pleasant.

I agree the MoD has done a terrible job in terms of foresight. But the fact is our armed forces are more than capable of projecting power just about anywhere in the globe, despite being arguably at it's 'weakest' for some time.

Not that it matters, because another war with Argentina over the Falklands is very unlikely. The Argentine government know damn well that the islands are far better defended than they were, despite their own armed forces not really changing much in the time since the war. Oh, and the fact Argentina is no longer a military dictatorship, despite having a horribly corrupt government.

We're also desperately short of coaches at grass roots level.

&gt;Is there actually any evidence for this though?

There have been plenty of studies showing high fuel prices lead to more fuel-efficient car purchases. You need only compare the mpg of the average US car to the average British car to see. People in the UK don't normally drive 4x4s unless they have to. In terms of public transport, I think the fact that these services are normally over-crowded proves there is a demand for them.

&gt;I get all that. I'm saying it won't happen. People like cars too much.

It depends on the alternative. If you offer them a cheaper train ticket, city-centre to city-centre in half the time then you're going to move a lot of people out of their cars. 

&gt;Why?

Electric cars are largely still in R+D right now. There are a lot of problems that need solved and R+D isn't a form of wish-fulfilment. It may simply be the case that electric cars will always be expensive and/or have shitty batteries

With that in mind, how do the supermarkets compare?

Tesco has a gigantic estate of both large supermarkets, and their network of Extras/Metros (not forgetting Onestop). They are very well placed for local trade, but their huge estate of larger supermarkets might be a millstone around their neck.

Sainsburys are similar to Tesco, but have fewer out-of-town shops, and local stores. They've appeared to pick their battles.

Asda has no local offering, which means they must be focusing their business on revenue solely through volume.

Morrisons has a small (but growing) network of local stores, and is pushing to compete heavily on price in their larger stores.

I reckon Tesco are going to put an immediate halt to further estate growth, particularly Extras, and begin a process of mothballing some of their less profitable out-of-town Extras (perhaps convert them to Click &amp; Collect/Delivery warehouses?). No other player is as well positioned for local trade as Tesco is, and the future of online is (mostly) estate-independent.

There is no way you will be able to walk around Brecon, see a few Castles *and* climb Snowdon in 1 day.

false,DevilishRogue,cnty-england,England,"Whether the guy over stepped the line or not this raises an interesting question about male/female dynamics and what is appropriate versus what works. For our species men traditionally do the courting and this is hard wired into our brains as a result of evolutionary processes to the extent that certain traits are pretty universally seen as attractive. It's ironic that persistence happens to be one of these and it often results in success for men and yet current political correct opinion is to criminalise it through labelling it ""unwanted advances"" (and for that matter how can one tell if advances are wanted before they are made?)

Sexual harassment legislation, whilst useful to prevent men from making continued advances to women who have made it clear that continued advances are not wanted, also acts against women who are seeking to see how determined the man in question is to pursue them, but of course, the man cannot always know to which camp the woman belongs. 

Whilst non-verbal communication and other social queues and signals can help make matters clear in many cases, these remain grey rather than black and white in nature and as such the man, particularly if he is famous or successful, risks almost everything to demonstrate his suitability as a potential partner. If the game of attraction didn't involve physical contact, innuendo, persistence and so on this wouldn't be a problem but as things stand male sexuality is effectively having to walk a legal tightrope at all times and those least able to make use of social context are also those most likely to fall foul of the law. 

Frankly, there are worse things in the world than ""unwelcome advances"" and the societal consequences of the resultant increased failure of marginalised men to procure a partner will become evident soon enough, but ignoring that there is a problem as we seem to currently do seems naive at best.

Not saying they're useless, but they aren't doing much.

&gt;There have been plenty of studies showing high fuel prices lead to more fuel-efficient car purchases. You need only compare the mpg of the average US car to the average British car to see. People in the UK don't normally drive 4x4s unless they have to.

That's not getting them out of their cars though is it? That's just getting them in a more efficient one, which I've said is the way forward.

&gt;In terms of public transport, I think the fact that these services are normally over-crowded proves there is a demand for them.

Yes obviously. But it doesn't show a trend does it? You could use the exact same argument on congested roads.

&gt;If you offer them a cheaper train ticket, city-centre to city-centre in half the time then you're going to move a lot of people out of their cars. 

You really think there's any chance of making things that cheap?

&gt;Electric cars are largely still in R+D right now.

Yes, but that doesn't mean they can never replace ICE. That doesn't make sense.

There are of course several on the roads that are *not* in R&amp;D. They are working.

&gt;There are a lot of problems that need solved 

There aren't actually that many at all, and none of them are even remotely insurmountable.

&gt;R+D isn't a form of wish-fulfilment.

Yes, yes it is. That's how you fix problems and develop new technologies.

&gt;electric cars will always be expensive 

You can get a used LEAF for about eight grand without much trouble.

They don't all have shitty batteries though. The Tesla Model S can cover more than a third of the length of the entire country without needing to recharge.

In the US at least, coincidentally I watched a review of US Presidents recently, and the most striking comment was in how sharply different Bush Snr's economic policies were to those of his predecessor Reagan. 

The charge was that Bush Snr said the right things, and wore the right clothes so as to appear the rightful heir to RR, but in really he was the complete opposite and acted as the trailblazer for Clinton/Dubya/Obama to follow suit.

Id hazard that considering the 1997 Conservative manifesto was quite a bold piece of free market propositioning, and was rejected for the New Labour path would suggest that Thatcherism trickdown economics died a death too.

Dont get me wrong, I am not saying that either periods were perfect, but it seems to be really quite a flimsy study if they assume that the policies of Thatcher and Reagan have been continued to this day.

What DUP are really good at every election is bringing up the past and fear mongering over protests and unrest on parades to bring everyone back to voting Green vs Orange.

And with the abysmil turnouts of elections nothing will change. From the recent spotlight programs on expenses i have no faith in any of them not even Simon Hamilton on understanding economics fully. What Invest NI have done in the last few years is yes they got over quite alot of jobs. But probably 90% of them are call center jobs. What people don't realise is there _is_ a large skills shortage of a technology based economy.

And every year at least in IT the  invest ni money was dumped to Liberty, Pace, American Dynamics and NYSE (now Euronext). They said they do this because its a _safe_ bet on giving the money to these big companies to keep jobs here. And pray they train up some people.

No money was ever invested in any up and comming local companies which are doing better and better every year.

If they instead used the millions they dumped into paying salaries to all the american companies in northern ireland and put it in education things would have looked much different now. Yes jobs would be more competitive but we would be more attractive to foreign investment because several companies are pulling out of Belfast now because they cant hire enough qualified staff. And remember invest NI is paying the salaries of most of these companies the company only really put some money forward and invest ni did the rest.

Look at the recent Citi expansion they said average salaries of £35k or something on the article and stuff on it. But the average salaries in Citit was much much lower than this and people had a kick up after seeing the article. There is a lot of bull shit going on really at this level. Not that i dont have any faith that the jobs are in good will and yes we do have some great people here but not enough to grow our economy correctly for a more stable future.

Lowering corporation tax isn't the 100% insentive for most companies to create more jobs in a country. Why not support our Local talent more correctly, and build our own future ourselves. And put more money in education.

Lowering the corporation tax in the end might cost us. Because say for argument sake 10 big companies opened up several thousand jobs there in essence wouldn't be the talent to fill the posts for a decent wage and in the end just will turn us into more support and call centres hampering our ability to move up the ladder even more.

&gt; Will the equality commission is certainly trying to make Asher's bakery do so.

Ashers already did take a public stance by refusing to serve a gay customer before the Equality commission stepped in. The fact the Equality commission got involved doesn't mean they're the ones that made it public. That's a logical fallacy.

&gt; Actually no it isn't, much of equality law is about being able to express your opinions freely without fear of being treated differently.

Fair - we both quoted basically half of it. But were Ashers being treated unfairly because a gay man wanted to pay them for a cake?

Argue that point out for me, thanks.

&gt; How is forcing someone to make a statement or take a stance, in any practical way, different from banning someone from making an opposing statement or taking an opposing stance?

Nobody is forcing anybody to ""take a stance"" as such, they're telling them to stop discriminating homosexuals and to just bite their tongues, serve their customers and get on with things. This isn't ""us vs them"" or ""religious vs atheists"" or any other daft dispute, this is a company refusing to serve someone because they're gay. This is not ok on ANY grounds. 

Its rather hypocritical too. Do they stop people at the door and ask if they're Muslim and refuse to serve them too? I doubt it. What about followers of Baal? Egyptians? Jewish people? After all, they killed Christ! They're using their religion as an excuse to pick on a single particular subset. It wouldn't be so bad if they were at least going by the entire book but no, they're cherry picking.

If it was the former I could imagine this happening because it's a very well respected uni. You only maintain that reputation if you kick out student who you don't feel can complete the course. 

If it's the latter I'd be genuinely surprised if they kicked you out after 1 failed exam. I went to an OK university, probably on par with Manchester Met, and I know they had students re-sit exams etc. 

I feel bad for you as it's a pretty shitty situation, but I feel there is something here you're probably not saying. The only reasons I could imagine a university flat out booting out a student after 1 failed exam was if:

1) The student was so hopelessly behind on the work they could never catch up, or if the student couldn't comprehend the content and they felt would not be able to progress to a full degree.

2) The student had not been attending lectures and seminars, and thus they failed because they were not committed to learning. They wont want such a student on their degree course.

3) If the student cheated on an exam or essay. Enough said.

There's no benefit to the university kicking a student off their courses if they feel it's possible for the student to get a degree (even a third). On the other hand, there are a lot of advantages to not letting a student progress to degree level if you think they are unlikely to finish the course. The whole point of a foundation year is to prep you for a full degree and to weed out people that wont be able to make the cut.

Less green that what? You're not making any sense. If all of the power is from a renewable source, the efficiency is completely irrelevant.

Fair enough, this is the *fuel mix disclosure*. Which shows renewables constitute well over a third of electricity consumed by consumers. This is not insignificant is it?

The 99% I referred to is the power generated within Norway.

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_in_Germany#Energy_consumption

This is total consumption in Germany.

But, during the first six months of 2014, almost 31% of German electric power (where the power for cars would come from) came from renewable sources, mainly wind, biogas, and solar; this was more than came from brown coal. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_Germany).

false,[deleted],null,null,"This reminds me of what Dizraeli said about the Corn laws. He said if we abolished the Corn laws it would make millions unemployed because it would not be able to compete with cheap, foreign grain. It's a load of doom and gloom that in the end and in reality would not materialise. Here's the simple facts:

1. We're not talking about an income that would allow one to live without working. People will still want to work because they will still want to earn more money. A guaranteed Minimum income won't allow one to live comfortably, but it would guarantee neither the unemployed nor the low paid will have to resort to starving or freezing to live.

2. Places need labour, and we need workers, what we could do is have it be lower than the Minimum wage or have the minimum wage be slightly higher. Is a rise in the minimum wage to attract people into work is a bad thing now? Even below minimum wage is better than no income or a pittance. Work won't disappear, people will still be encouraged to work because £6.60 an hour for 20 hours is more attractive than the equivalent of £4.40 an hour over the same time. It would however alleviate a lot of stress over ""how the hell am I going to pay for this and that"". It may also allow them to be better equipped to find a job because instead of being at the Jobcentre either being badgered, treated like shit, sanctioned or being at half retarded classes and allow them to attend colleges or get work experience in voluntary work or even, for the more enterprising among us, start their own enterprises to make their own money.

3. Even people in work are struggling. We have people in full time work resorting to foodbanks because they can't afford to eat *even with* the wage they earn and *even with* them ""doing without"" (which according to a lot of people seem to involve going without basic clothing, heating and electricity). The people in those jobs won't quit, they'll still want that income from the job, but that extra income will allow them to stop worrying about needed to buy essentials.

4. More people with a little more money to spend is a benefit to the economy. That's a simple fact

I find your idea that it would see a crash in the number of people working both bigoted and in itself, naive. 90% of Glasgow refusing to work? Fuck off, the poor are not the lazy, feckless pieces of shit the government wants to paint them as. Unemployed people, given the chance, even if on benefits want to work because earning money is better than living off a small allowance to make sure you don't die. And why Glasgow? Are you saying Glaswegians are all poor, lazy and dumb? Fuck you, both for being a bigoted asshat and insulting the fair people of Glasgow. Also, surely the fact that people are struggling living on a pittance would be an argument to raise the minimum wage just a touch? 

What a BMI will do is not end the need to work, the most it would do is end the need for the low paid jobs that would be better done with machines anyway, and most of those jobs will go anyway, BMI or not, when automation with machines becomes a cheaper option than employing people, and that is starting to happen now, and no amount of activism or laws will change that because ""the invisible hand of the market"" doesn't care about people, it cares about money, and if that means leaving millions unemployed and left to starve then so be it. By that point, and it'll happen soon, BMI will be one of the few options we have left bar switching to another economic system entirely.

I disagree that everyone knew. I suspect a few people did know, and were cowards, but that is very different to everyone in the media knowing. Perhaps many would have heard rumours, but they work in media, there are new rumours about everyone in the public eye everyday. 

&gt; It doesn't actually work like that mate. All you need to do is fine one person willing to testify.

Not how it works - without further proof, it is their word against his which will result in no conviction. Rumour and conjecture don't count as evidence, even if they later are proved to be correct. 

You mention the fact that even the humblest investigative journalist could have found some evidence by going back and talking to children. This is possible but it ignores the common problem with cases of rape/molestation etc that many victims don't want to open up old wounds - mainly because they feel nothing good can come of it. If they feel that they cannot prove it (their word against his) then they will not only have suffered this trauma but they will be branded a liar for talking about it. Even just to talk to an journalist about it anonymously will bring back every painful moment of the ordeal, and it could well be for nothing. So an investigative journalist may actually run in to a lot of trouble gathering sufficient evidence for it. 

The evidence suggests lot of people had heard rumours, but very few people actually knew.

false,Taure,null,null,"Yes, you have legal rights, though enforcing them could get very expensive and the case is quite weak, in that you have essentially failed examinations and been kicked out for it. However, the means by which it was done is not quite right.

First off you're going to need to look at the university regulations. If they've broken any of their own regulations (one would think there is a procedure for resits) then that puts you in a good position. If they have an internal appeals process you need to exhaust that process to its limit, though the amount of time that has passed will work against you here significantly.

Once you've exhausted internal appeals to their limit, if you still don't have the result you want, and you feel like something very unfair has happened, that's when you bring in a lawyer (though you also might like to take one with you to an appeal if you get one).

The decisions of universities, being quasi-public, are subject to judicial review. Even if a university's own regulations state an appeal to be final, this does not exclude the possibility of judicial review. It is not within the power of a university to place themselves above the law.

However, the time delay is going to work against you significantly here. Judicial review proceedings have to be brought within 3 months after the grounds to make the claim. However, as you never appealed the original decision, if you were to appeal it now (and it's not too late for the university's appeal procedures to apply) then the appeal would be happening now, so judicial review of that appeal would be possible.

There are a variety of grounds for judicial review.

If they've broken their own procedures in throwing you out, you can accuse them of ""procedural ultra vires"" - they've acted beyond their powers as outlined in the regulations governing their decision making powers.

It's unlikely that you could accuse them of irrationality. Chucking someone out who failed their exams is not likely to be considered irrational by a court.

If they've acted within the regulations but the regulations themselves are what you contest, then you're going to have to accuse them of unfairness. Even if their regulations do not include a duty to act fairly, the court will ""supply the omission"" and conclude that they have that duty.

Fairness includes a duty for the university to give you warning of their intention prior to making their decision, allow you the chance of being heard to object prior to the decision, and to know the full circumstances around the decision. This was established in the case of *R v Norfolk County Council Services Department, es parte M* [1989].

From the way you tell the story of the meeting, it sounds like they have acted unfairly towards you.

A few caveats to this:

1. By no means does this mean that you would be successful in judicial review. It merely means that your case is not completely groundless. 

2. Even if you won the case, you probably wouldn't get what you want. The court would just tell the university to remake the decision in accordance with their regulations in a fair way. Given that you did fail the exams, it's unlikely that your circumstances would change (unless the regulations say you should have had the chance to resit).

3. I'm not a lawyer, this does not constitute legal advice. You should see a qualified solicitor for reliable legal advice.

If a bar has a rainbow flag above the door it is making you aware that it is a gay bar. If it has as sign on the door that says ""WARNING: GAYS!"" it is warning you. 

I'm not sure that ""not wanting to go to a gay bar"" is a bad thing in itself, is it? They are different from other bars (if they weren't, they'd just be ""bars that allow gay people in"", which is most/all bars), so is it not reasonable that they just wouldn't be someone's cup of tea, regardless of their view of homosexuality? 

Anyway, it strikes me that it could be the kind of situation where a company boss assumes that they need to worry about offending people, whereas in reality the people in question couldn't care less (similar to the ""don't say Merry Christmas. You might offend a Muslim"" nonsense) and in doing so go way too far the other way and upset everyone. For all we know, there might not even be any religious staff members. 

Their biggest mistake was specifying their reason for asking. Had they just said ""are you a gay bar?"" I doubt anyone would give the slightest shit.

He's got all the tools. He's fast, has a good shot on him, has a good instinct for taking on defenders, but the problem is his decision making is complete and utter dogshit. I'm guessing this is because the Austrian Bundesliga isn't much compared to the PL and he could get away with a lot more there, but that's the kind of thing that can be taught. Compare that to someone like Gaston who IMO just isn't good enough to play in this league. Mane *is* good enough already, but we're not seeing it because it's stuck behind a layer of headless chicken syndrome. Early in the United game is a good example. He stole the ball from one of their defenders (McNair?), beat two or three defenders, and then got caught in his own feet in the box and lost the ball. 

The difference I see between Mane and our flops like Gaston/Guly/De Ridder/Mayuka is they didn't have the tools. I totally believe Mane can be a useful player for our side, he's already shown flashes of why we bought him, but he needs to sort his head out. The best thing for that is not having to start every game and focusing on solid performances off the bench, but that's not really an option right now when our only other players in his position are Tadic (who's needed centrally with our injury issues) McQueen, Isgrove, and an injured Jay Rod.

The 50 Shades of Grey film will have to be submitted to the BBFC for a rating, like all commercial films in the UK. Given that it is a major Hollywood production (and needs to get through the US rating system as well) it will probably be planned with a 15 rating in mind, maybe an 18. If it fails to get an 18 (or R18) certificate the BBFC may 'suggest' cuts that the distributors can make in order for it to qualify for that rating. [Already the trailer for the film has been [given a 15 certificate](http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/fifty-shades-grey-videotrailer).]

Nationally the BBFC certificate is only legally binding on the sale of videos, not on cinemas. And if something isn't likely to get a BBFC certificate it now can't be included in a VoD service. The rules for cinemas are down to the local authorities but in general they will follow the BBFC guidelines (there have been a couple of cases where local authorities have refused to let certain films be shown - e.g. Monty Python's Life of Brian - or lowered the rating of a film, under public pressure).

*tl;dr: The film will almost certainly get a 15 or 18 certificate from the BBFC (possibly with cuts if needed), so will be perfectly legal.*",0,1418139681,null,0,false,0,cmps2qd,t3_2or2ai,t1_cmps2qd,t3_2or2ai,null,1425524694,66,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,66

Not every job can be completed successfully by 3 people working 1/3 of the hours. 3rd tier jobs, shop workers, cleaners, shift workers, can have shorter shifts easily. Surgeons, managers and most types of engineers require long hours of concentrated efforts. Breaking that up between multiple people would require a huge amount of further managerial oversight, if it's even possible at all.

So you have low level workers working less, taking a pay cut but gaining large amounts of free time - and high level workers who stay on higher wages with, paradoxically, more managerial type work to do due to the higher number of people at the bottom of the pyramid.

There would be, even more than there is now, a level of society who are in full time work, and a lower level who are only able to get shift work, in shorter and shorter lengths. Recruiters will pick those with a history of full time work, over those who only have a background of today's ""zero-hour contracts"".

Cultures thrive on a strong middle class, there is extensive proof of this throughout modern history. Providing a dividing line between those who have access to higher pay and those who are able to scrape existence (or if it is more profitable to remain unemployed) is not the way to have a secure financial future for the country or its individuals.

What I'm saying is not that I don't want Spurs to acquire new players that may be golden one day.  Nothing would please me more than to see more Real Madrid prospects playing at WHL.  My point is that focusing on getting that one great player, and imagining that it will solve all of the team's problems, is a mistake.  It's a mistake we've seen Spurs make before, and I daresay one of the primary reasons why the club is in the position it's in now.

If your winning strategy is based solely on utilizing the skills of exceptional players, like with Bale under AVB, you'll always be extremely vulnerable if and when those players are injured or leave.  Alternately, if you focus on building a team that knows how to win games together, where all the players know their role as well as the roles of their teammates, and trust that everyone does their job like they're supposed to, you will not be as dependent on that one star for success, and your whole play won't crumble when he's inevitably sold.  This year's Southampton could be the perfect example of this: even when Pochettino and several of his best players left (or were injured, like Rodriguez), the team mentality and cohesiveness of the remaining squad stayed at St. Mary's, which I would imagine is one of the main reasons why they're doing as well as they are this year.",0,1418140590,null,0,false,0,cmpsj0b,t3_2oqypp,t1_cmpsj0b,t1_cmpreow,null,1425524483,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

 [**United Kingdom general election, 1979**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United%20Kingdom%20general%20election,%201979): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __United Kingdom general election of 1979__ was held on 3 May 1979 to elect [635 members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MPs_elected_in_the_United_Kingdom_general_election,_1979) to the [British House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom). The [Conservative Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK\)), led by [Margaret Thatcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher) ousted the incumbent [Labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK\)) government of [James Callaghan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Callaghan) with a parliamentary majority of 44 seats. The election was the first of four consecutive election victories for the Conservative Party, and Thatcher became the United Kingdom's - and Europe's - first female [head of government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government).

&gt;The previous parliamentary term had begun in October 1974, when [Harold Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Wilson) led Labour to a majority of three seats, but within 18 months he had resigned as prime minister to be succeeded by [James Callaghan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Callaghan), and within a year the government's narrow parliamentary majority had gone. Callaghan had made agreements with the [Liberals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_(UK\)), the [Ulster Unionists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Unionist_Party), as well as the [Scottish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_National_Party) and [Welsh nationalists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaid_Cymru) in order to remain in power. When the Scottish Nationalists withdrew support, a [vote of no confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_vote_of_no_confidence_in_the_government_of_James_Callaghan) was passed on Callaghan's government, triggering a general election.

&gt;The Labour campaign was hampered by the series of industrial disputes and strikes during the Winter of 1978-79, known as the [Winter of Discontent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_of_Discontent) and the party focused its campaign on support for the [National Health Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service) and full employment. After intense media speculation, Callaghan had announced early in the autumn of 1978 that a general election would not take place that year having received private polling data which suggested a parliamentary majority was unlikely.

The latest advice/opinion from the CPS is that the act of uploading from abroad, to a downloader in the UK is the same as publishing.

Failure to do so would likely breach the Obscene Publications Act 1959.

However that seems to be what the reactionary commenting on the porn bans is saying but as I got halfway through the article before I gave up on it I could not say that definitively. Could you for instance link me to a government statement related to the banning of female ejaculation along the lines of ""it doesn't exist""? Because as of yet I have not read that in print.

It seems to me that sadly people are taking the opinions of one party and presenting them as fact.

What it actually seems to me is that they seem to have banned it due to it's relation to water sports, which they have also banned.

Have you ever seen female ejaculation porn? It is very similar in nature to watersports and much of it is just pissing on people and claiming it's female ejaculation, there really aren't that many places that can store and release a cup and indeed much more full of liquid in the urinary tract other than the bladder. 

Now I'm sorry but looking over the evidence of it all and the way one side displays it's evidence and the way he other displays its feels mixed in with what the other side are saying but omitting half of the results, I know which side seems more plausible.

Still, I say this is irrelevant as I am totally against porn bans. I also find it rather interesting that the same people making most of the noise in the theme of ""this is an attack against women"" oddly seem to be the same people who were calling all porn an attack against women last month.

It's nonsensical and only distracts from the actual issue the porn bans represent.

OECD

&gt;The paper also finds no evidence that redistributive policies, such as taxes and social benefits, harm economic growth, **provided these policies are well designed, targeted and implemented.**

Guardian

&gt;The economy expanded by 40% during the 1990s and 2000s but would have grown by almost 50% had inequality not risen. 

It actually said if it had not changed, but when measuring inequality they didnt factor in how much people received through education, services etc.

&gt;Redistribution through public services, such as health, education, social housing and
assistance, or of services to the unemployed and active labour-market policies is therefore not taken into

I commented mainly because this guy is in the same position I want to be in a few years, and this is what I'd do if I were him. I apologise for spreading misinformation, if that is what I've done, and in retrospect I admit my post probably wasn't very helpful for anyone.

It's true that I have little personal experience, but I've spent a lot of time reading in the subject. If you have time, I'd appreciate any specific criticism you have about my comment, as it represents my current understanding of finance and I'd love to know where I went wrong. As I understand it (mostly based on mr. money mustache and ""your money or your life""), over the long term the stock market averages returns of about 7%/year adjusted for inflation (http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/06/06/dude-wheres-my-7-investment-return/). A safe withdrawal rate hovers around 3-4% depending on country (http://www.retirementinvestingtoday.com/2014/05/further-exploration-of-safe-withdrawal.html). Vanguard offers the cheapest investments of any company (given that fees are the only thing an investor can control, it's important to keep them as low as possible). Vanguard forms the core investments of both of the financial bloggers I follow (Mr. Money Mustache and http://jlcollinsnh.com/), and their LifeStrategy fund is the most diversified index fund available to us in the UK. 80% equity will probably yeild the best gains (for a moderately high risk) if you don't need to touch the money for 10+ years.

It makes a change that for once they aren't just simply blaming the Tories for everything, and actually coming up with policies.

* Scrapping the winter fuel allowance of the top 5% is a risky move, though I can see the logic behind it in principle.

* ""Create a million new high technology, green jobs by 2025"" seems like a promise they can't possibly keep (it assumes they manage to somehow staying in government for 10 years. Not to mention I've never understood what ""creating jobs"" means, you can't just create jobs, jobs are produced by demand...)

* ""Require large employers hiring skilled workers from outside
the EU to offer apprenticeships"" - this might actually help deal with the skill gap between the natives and immigrant workers. The problem with immigration though is that employers are able to get away with paying immigrant workers less..

* ""Introduce a Compulsory Jobs Guarantee, paid for by a bank
bonus tax, to provide a paid starter job for every young person
unemployed for over a year."" - this depends on what they mean by 'starter job', the cynic in me ends up thinking this could end up just being a rebranded workfare scheme

* ""Devolve regional transport decision making so that areas can
bring together trains, buses, ferries and trams into a single
network with smart-ticketing."" - personally, I would have centralised transport further in order enforce smart-ticketing systems nationwide but again I suppose that depends on what they are actually promising here...

* ""Abolish Ofgem and replace it with a tough new energy
watchdog."" - what's wrong with Ofgem?

* ""Give mental health the priority it deserves with a new right to
access talking therapies enshrined in the NHS Constitution"" - thank fuck, finally

* ""Guarantee that patients will wait no longer than one week for
vital cancer tests and results by 2020."" - the guarantee is already 2 weeks for urgent screenings, the problem is that for whatever reason, healthcare providers are failing to meet this guarantee...

* ""Scrap Police and Crime Commissioners in order to protect
frontline police numbers."" - I hope this doesn't turn into a back and forth where the Tories keep reintroducing them and Labour keep scrapping them

* ""Hand local communities new powers to get homes built where
they want them.""  - Okay, and the first thing we propose with these powers is to build a housing estate in Buckingham Palace.

* ""Enact Britain’s first Victims’ Law to put victims at the heart of
justice system."" - Because currently Britain puts the defendant at the heart of the justice system?

* ""Require public sector workers in public facing roles to speak
English."" - well Labour have just alienated their Welsh voters...

* ""Give football fans a voice in every club boardroom and the right to buy a significant slice of their local football club if ownership changes hands."" - Oh God please no, the last thing we need are football clubs effectively run by drunk people

* ""Devolve to all parts of England, including the shires, not just
the Tories limited plans for a handful of big cities."" - Frodo will be happy

* ""Replace the House of Lords with a Senate of the Nations and
Regions."" - Eww, that's such an American sounding name

Otherwise, a lot of their proposals are quite reasonable and sensible. We can only hope that they can/are willing to actually implement them. The issue of course is that a lot of their proposals for helping the people whilst balancing the books are very much dependent on their ability to pass through some of the more 'controversial' taxes/cuts they promise - if they can't secure an absolute majority in the Commons, that could be an uphill battle..

1. I would say try and live in Belfast if that's where you're going to be working. The cost of living is quite low compared to other European cities, so you could afford something okay. That, and you'll be a lot closer to the immense number of awesome things Belfast has to offer - great restaurants, bars, etc. Also, running a car can be quite expensive over here!

2. I haven't met any Swedes yet, but I've only been here a short time myself. They definitely exist though! There are quite a few companies in Belfast who hire Europeans for their native languages - companies like Concentrix etc have multi-lingual staff, so you'll definitely find some. If not, check out the Belfast Language Exchange group on Facebook, or a website like Couchsurfing or MeetUp.

3. Most of the Catholic/Protestant thing has been hyped up by the media. I feel perfectly safe walking in most areas of Belfast. However, like any city, it's best not to wander too far from the centre at nighttime. Also, it's more about Nationalist vs Unionist rather than about religion. Catholic/Protestant are more euphemisms than serious identifications.

I would advise living in South Belfast though - around the Lisburn Road or University area. There is a high density of international people, bars, clubs, etc, and it's very mixed and friendly. Just don't live in an area called the 'Holylands', which is a major student area. Basically, you won't get any sleep there!

Sorry but I just don't agree with this. The name of the product is just that, a name. It is not a description of what is in the product. The pie probably contain other things in higher quantities than the alcohol, like vegetables, but no one is complaining that it was not named a steak and onion pie. 

If the pie contained a large amount of alcohol, then it absolutely should have been labelled as such, but it only contained trace amounts, so what exactly makes it a steak and ale pie any more than a streak pie, or a steak and onion pie?

Sorry, but you're wrong. If it's expired then the ID/passport is void and cannot be used as proof of anything in any official context. Most bouncers aren't so anal as to enforce it of course, but technically the expiry date matters.

There is a good reason these things have expiry dates (just like debit/credit cards, driving licences, etc.). As technology moves on they become easier and easier to fake and ID's issued incorrectly or rescinded are harder to remove from the system if they don't expire. If you have online-lookups to check ID (like we have for bank cards and road-side police checks etc.) its not so critical an issue, but most IDs expire after 10 years at most for these reasons.

A bloke I went to school with who is a floor manager in a supermarket got a phenomenal bollocking (formal written warning and ""retraining"") when their company's secret shoppers managed to buy fags and booze using an expired ID on his watch - even though it was otherwise legitimate.

I capitalized American for you for starters, also this idea ignores the fact the the USA is the single largest source of Global aid to countries other than itself, whether it be monetary or otherwise. Beyond your wording being really awful, you are completely incorrect when it comes to Americans' view of the world.  Essentially you are just tying together big words in the hopes of slandering America while making yourself sound stupid.  

Furthermore, did it ever occur to you that these things are predominantly determined by the origin of the service that you are using?  That when you use a service based in the USA they will tend to use an American flag to denote the English language?  I suppose if this really bothered you, then you could start up and develop your own companies and then you could make the choice whatever flag pleases you for the English language.

I never said this was true hence 'stereotypically'. Yes the majority of websites are american as the industry is booming there but that then leads me to the point of why isn't the spanish language represented by a mexican flag or a spanish/mexican combination flag? All i'm saying is it seems incredibly arrogant, and to some extent ignorant, to use a flag to represent a language from which the language isn't a) named after and b) originate from.

UKIP does also have a few ways which they state they can get money back into the country, such as not having to pay the EU, cutting foreign aid substantially, introducing a 35p income tax rate for those who earn between £42k and £55k.

What don't you agree with? That steak and ale pie is often labelled as exactly that? What is there to disagree with? I didn't make a statement expressing a particular opinion either way - except to say that I don't know whether I would automatically assume that a 'steak' pie will contain ale.

&gt; what exactly makes it a steak and ale pie any more than a streak pie, or a steak and onion pie?

A steak pie does not necessarily contain any alcohol at all, while a steak and ale pie does? If you read 'steak pie', do you automatically assume that ale will be included in the pie, *particularly* since you are fully aware of the existence of steak and ale pie, which most definitely *does* include ale?

&gt; You should not expect to get any dietary information from the name of the product. If you have strict dietary requirements you should always ask before you order anything.

I never said anything that disagrees with this. As long as you *can* get hold of the dietary information I don't think there's a massive problem. While it would be nice to always have the correct information to hand, the practicalities of doing this are probably quite prohibitive, so we should probably settle for a (relatively) happy compromise.

I don't know why you think I'm arguing against you when I actually agree with you on virtually every point.

It developed into its current state in England but its *origin*, the thing we have been discussing here, was not in England.  There is nothing wrong with that, it's just a fact of life.  So the details you have laid out are moot to the discussion.   

&gt;Yes but that's the American government, not the American population which as it stand is currently depicted world wide as ignorant to the rest of world and its history.  

Don't believe everything you see on TV.  

Sure we have a lot of ignorant assholes living here but believing they are the norm is quite naive.  If I based my assumptions about Englishmen on things like ""Shameless"" or people like Piers Morgan I would be way off base now wouldn't I?  All I ask is that you look at this logically and stop trying to attach a *USA vs England* mentality to it. It's just silly, it makes a funny meme, but you seem genuine in your concern.  

&gt;leads me to the point of why isn't the spanish language represented by a mexican flag or a spanish/mexican combination flag? 
-------------------------  
&gt;All i'm saying is it seems incredibly arrogant, and to some extent ignorant, to use a flag to represent a language from which the language isn't a) named after and b) originate from.

Good question.  I would direct this to the developers of the service and stop trying to find ways to squarely place the blame on millions of uninvolved American citizens, or our government, for things that they clearly do not control.  

This decision was likely made by a small group of people during the development stage and is in no way a reflection of popular attitudes of an entire country of people.  Trying to say this is the case is not only absurd, it is intellectually dishonest. Being a student I would think you would know better.  

&gt;Also you trying to bring grammar into this is just you being a pedant and most likely have the prescriptivist approach towards language, no?
------------------
&gt;i think spell check has a massive part of this, a lot of people don't know how to change the language preference which is by default american english **so we spell things in the correct english way**  

You lecture me on the development of the language, call one dialect correct over another and then say that I'm the prescriptivist?

false,john_locke1689,,Belfast. Mayonnaise.,"&gt;So who decides this? What instances? The Equality commission? The courts? What constitutes ""In support""? Selling wine to someone off to a gay wedding? Who defines appropriate? What services? This stance is untenable and illogical.

It would be the courts, its their job to determine whether or not someone broke the law. This is all very tricky where best to draw the line, as I've mentioned so I'm not going to come out and say that this is the most practical way of going about it, but having a bill in place that puts the general practice in place and then relying on case law to draw the finer details. Although in the Asher's case it's quite easy as its so explicit.

&gt; Ashers already did take a public stance by refusing to serve a gay customer before the Equality commission stepped in. 

First of all they didn't refuse service to a gay customer, they refused to make a cake with a political message on it.
But this was a stance Asher's chose to make, and it is nobody else's choice what Asher's want to say but theirs.

&gt;The fact the Equality commission got involved doesn't mean they're the ones that made it public. That's a logical fallacy.

The equality commission would have them publicly make a statement through their business that they disagree with. 

&gt;Fair - we both quoted basically half of it. But were Ashers being treated unfairly because a gay man wanted to pay them for a cake? 

No

&gt;Was he using the cake as a subtle ruse to attempt buttsex with them?Was he going to take them out to a disco afterwards against their will and make them listen to the village people? Argue that point out for me, thanks.

No, and at this point you're being facetious and redirecting from the point.

&gt; Nobody is forcing anybody to ""take a stance"" as such, they're telling them to stop discriminating homosexuals and to just bite their tongues, serve their customers and get on with things. 

Well they're not telling them to stop discriminating against homosexuals at all, indeed have they not dropped the accusations of homophobia, if anyone had went into that shop and ordered a ""support gay marriage"" cake then they would have been told the same thing, quite simply it wasn't on the menu. Why should they have to bite their tongue though? Its not the equality commission's job to silence opposition in debate.

&gt;This isn't ""us vs them"" or ""religious vs atheists"" or any other daft dispute, this is a company refusing to serve someone because they're gay. This is not ok on ANY grounds. 

No it isn't, they didn't refuse service on the grounds the individual was gay, and if they did I'd agree it is despicable behaviour.

&gt;Its rather hypocritical too. Do they stop people at the door and ask if they're Muslim and refuse to serve them too? I doubt it. What about followers of Baal? Egyptians? Jewish people? After all, they killed Christ! They're using their religion as an excuse to pick on a single particular subset. It wouldn't be so bad if they were at least going by the entire book but no, they're cherry picking.

Well they don't stop people at the door and make them fill in a form, because they're not refusing services on the basis of who or what the customer is but on what the customer wants. Now if they were also making cakes that read messages that were pro Islam or Hinduism or any other religious statements then I'd say its hypocritical of them and their religious beliefs. 

&gt;And you're saying that's ok.

Of course I am, why on earth would I want a law were you could be legally obligated to support a cause you don't believe in if you were offered to be paid for it.

&gt;You're literally the only person on this entire thread suggesting it's ok. I'd love to know why. 

Because I like the idea of freedom of speech, I like open debate having the ability to say what I please, and if you don't like it you can argue and debate with me. I do not like the idea of having my beliefs bought.

Do you honestly believe that this will be a better place if only certain people are allowed to express their beliefs? If so who decides which people are allowed more freedom than the rest of us?

I've only ever been impressed when I've seen him speaking. You can make anyone look weird if you take a hundred photos of them eating a sandwich.

I don't think they will be spectacularly better than our current government but I'm so angry at decision after decision our current gov is making that is helping rich people and businesses and seriously harming the people at the bottom. I can honestly say I'd rather see people not starving than I would see our GDP improve. That effects me a lot more. I think Labour are our best chance at not having another Conservative government. When we had Labour before, short of going to war twice - but this I believe any potential government would have done, I felt policies were made with citizens as the primary interest. Now it feels like we're just in the way. I disliked the tories as opposition, I dislike them now and I still like Labour as opposition. This tells me I'm not just voting *against* the current government.

As with many people my age, I previously have voted Lib Dem. I was a student, but thankfully a graduating one, when tuition fees were raised but got to see that first hand. I won't be surprised if they start to raise their voices as the election rears its head but I won't be voting for them. I understand that they may have reigned in the tories a bit but they showed a complete disconnect with the people who voted for them, they showed me I was wrong to vote for them.

Greens are appealing but have too many oddball policies. They have a chance to become a legitimate third choice but they won't get anywhere as they are.

UKIP are a bit scary. I live in a part of town with a lot of Spanish, Portuguese and Turkish people and have no problem with that. Any time I've visited London, I've certainly witnessed immigration in action but nothing negative. I think people should be welcome to vote UKIP if, for them, the EU and immigration is their primary concern. I don't like all the hatred towards them (the voters).

No, that's not my point at all - nowhere near it. I'll make my thoughts clear though: if someone has been subjected to racism then that doesn't exclude them from being held up when they do it to others. 

My thought on the Jewish front occurred to me as I was writing the comment: People have been pointing out that Balotelli has suffered from racism all his life, therefore ""so what?"" if he's said something that some might construe as racist.

I was wondering as to whether he was been subjected to racism due to his Jewish heritage, because their claim would imply that ""he's suffered from that kind of grief, so leave him alone"". I suspect he hasn't, but not that it necessarily matters in this instance. He still put out the 'joke' to a very large audience and all that that entails.

Another thought that just struck me on the Jewish front: He said his mother is Jewish, not that he is. He didn't say anything along the lines of ""I can poke fun at my people if I want to"" so far as I know, which sort of undermines those trying to defend his comment because it's ""his"" heritage.",0,1418147362,null,0,false,0,cmpw9k4,t3_2omnhe,t1_cmpw9k4,t1_cmp4p6w,null,1425522739,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

But they would rather focus on keeping property values high regardless of the economic and social cost - they are obsessed with conserving a distant past rather than building a brighter future.

Also my mother is disabled (with severe systemic lupus) and their demonisation of those on welfare is quite frankly evil. They continue to attack the weakest in our society and to roll out populist policies to placate the electorate with little thought to the benefit to the nation.

I'm traditionally a Lib Dem voter, but I have lost all faith in the Westminster establishment. I have also been pleasantly surprised with how well the SNP have been running Holyrood for the past 7 years in Scotland. My personal politics align with the Greens the most (Patrick Harvie is my local Green MSP and politician of choice), but a Green vote is wasted in the Westminster election system sadly.

According to the most recent polls, [2015 is projected to be **a hung parliament with Labour short of about 40 seats**](http://www.ukelect.co.uk/HTML/forecasts.html). The SNP are also projected to gain about 40 seats and wipe out Labour in Scotland. There is a very good chance that the SNP will be the third largest party in Westminster (ahead of the Lib Dems, and well ahead of other minority parties including UKIP), potentially giving them the power to choose who is in power.

Given these circumstances, I would like to see a Labour-SNP coalition. Scotland voted to stay in the UK, and I'd like to see Scotland and the rest of the UK support that decision by supporting a Labour-SNP government. The SNP are progressive, socialist, pragmatic - they are what Labour *should* be and in theory should work well together. The SNP will ensure that the agenda is not focused on London and the South East, and be the progressive voice in UK politics that we desperately need right now.",0,1418150209,null,0,false,0,cmpxxuh,t3_2orgey,t1_cmpxxuh,t3_2orgey,null,1425521958,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

The problem is so nuanced, and contains so many variables, I'm not sure there is a catch-all solution which will work for all people in all cases. The best that can be done is fire-fighting the extremities and hope that the general model drifts towards an upward direction.

There are too many opposing forces at work. A consumer culture which creates demand for products, and drives innovation, investment and therefore jobs needs a set of customers who can afford to buy things they don't really need.

In order for people to afford ""excesses"", we're no longer solving the problem of who can eat and have a roof over their heads, we're creating a society which requires wastage and demands *things* to be happy.

The target demographic for all this has to be a middle class, those lower down the pay scales are not the focus of how today's culture pays for itself.

I'm not totally convinced that any amount of social conditioning or welfare can tackle the issue of inequality. It is equally vital that the carrot of a better standard of living is there to promote better work and self improvement, while ensuring those without the means to help themselves can be looked after.

In an ideal world, the pyramid of wealth would be sliced off at the top, and the proceeds can be used to increase standards at the bottom. 
However, slice off too much at the top, and you lose the motivation to climb up (through education, increase in skills and therefore better pay). Or worse, those with high incomes will move their funds offshore, out of reach.

It is also important to ensure than whatever money is taken from the top, it's usage on the bottom is effective. Handing out cash - the idea of a minimum household income - is a bandage. It doesn't create jobs, or provide a means to become self sufficient. And arguably it provides motivation for the opposite.

This is a long way of saying what I said above. Inequality cannot be solved by handouts, though obviously doing nothing isn't an option either.",0,1418150226,null,0,false,0,cmpxy71,t3_2oqu48,t1_cmpxy71,t1_cmpv58h,null,1425521953,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

So I had a look at your posting history to see if I could see something that might allow me to give you some better advice...

Jan 2013, 4 months into your course you posted that [you'd not been to the library or learning comms yet](http://www.reddit.com/r/manchester/comments/16b8cn/any_manchester_university_studentsgraduates_have/c814k0j) at the University because you ""can't be assed to walk there"". you talk about how your Maths was shite... You're studying Chemistry, you NEED to know maths. [Trying to blame the entirety of the UK education system](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/184yg1/he_did_exactly_what_he_was_told/c8c0rxu) is retarded. 

I started my chemistry degree at 24, I'd not touched maths for 8 years beyond a bit of accountancy stuff... Guess what I did? Got my arse to the library took out some books and worked on it. I taught myself basic calculus in 4 months. Was it hard? Fuck yes. I felt like smashing my brain in, but I put in the time to overcome my weaknesses and now I'll graduate in 2016 with a Masters degree. 

Oh, and [being a xenophobic moron about the whole](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bioshock/comments/1f2uz1/thought_you_might_appreciate_this_launderette_in/ca6f2as) thing isn't a great idea...

And last but not least, [your posting history doth shine more light on the matter](http://www.reddit.com/r/manchester/comments/1mnhfe/new_to_manchester/ccb6hvr?context=3)... 

So, basically... This whole post is bullshit. You KNOW there was a reason why you got kicked out, but are trying to get some advice you can use to twist your way back in. I'm intrigued as to what the reason was, as well as whatever you decided to delete. 

At university, you sit 120 credits a year. To gain the degree, you must pass at least 100 of those credits each year. Resits are capped at 40%. Gaining a degree is not like getting A levels. There's no infinite resits. Very little handholding. You do the work or stop wasting peoples time. 

I've been a student rep for a few years on my chemistry course and there are two types of struggling students: Ones who need help and ones who won't help themselves. I'm pretty damn sure you're one of the latter. ",0,1418150298,null,0,1418150518,0,cmpxzrd,t3_2or0l8,t1_cmpxzrd,t3_2or0l8,null,1425521933,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

&gt;Early Day Motion 605, which is designed to annul the Audiovisual Media Services Regulations 2014 (S.I., 2014, No. 2916), is a truly important motion for the freedom of this country.

&gt;Despite your voting history being an almost polar-opposite to my personal views, I believe you too would agree that the banning of this sort of media opens the floodgates to an insidious undermining of the freedom of this country.

&gt;The acts described in the regulation (e.g. tying, female ejaculation, female domination are a few highlights) are perfectly legal between consenting adults (as they should be), and so pornographic depictions should also be legal for adults over the age of 18.

&gt;As you are a conservative, I would hope, if not from a moral standpoint, you sign the Early Day Motion on the basis of small government (which if I recall is a major Conservative party platform). By making the government become the thought police, this will only increase the reach of the government, which we have already seen with the failed pornography filter that received major backlash, and just does not work and cost the government millions.

&gt;So I ask that you sign the motion, as it is an issue that I believe is bi-partisan in nature. Everyone enjoys sex, and everyone's tastes are different. The UK should be the forefront of freedom within Europe and the world, not descending into censorship akin to China and North Korea. That way madness lies.

false,whelks_chance,uk,Englishman in Wales,"It is a serious issue, and I've tried to address that in the comment above. Powerful people will obviously ensure future power for themselves and the select few around them.

The issue is essentially a feudal one, money definitely buys power, and there becomes a point where there is noone powerful enough to stop it. Least of all politicians, who would be tasked with solving the problems. 
Even ignoring the conflict of interest to a high powered politician - they require rich people to employ the populous (insert contradictory statistics here), and often they wouldn't mind a high paying job once they leave office.

In terms of productivity providing wealth, I'm not sure there is a connection between the two. We do not live in a meritocracy, where those who do well gain more money. Nor do we live in a society where those who work hardest earn higher incomes.

Instead, we reward those who ""play the game"". Joining the rat-race and working up the ladders using whatever skills are required within whatever industry. Managers employ those they ""feel"" would be a good fit for the position, especially as the pay grades increase.

So working 2 days a week will always earn you 2 days pay. And those who choose to work 3 days will do so, and earn more, and prices will rise to match perceived value in a product. Value is in the eye of the beholder, and is rarely based on costs of raw material or labour - especially, again, with higher priced items.

Money only works when it moves. If a CEO is saving it all, this effectively removes it from circulation, so noone benefits from it any more. One trick to fix the whole thing would be to insist they spend it all each year. Remove interest payments on anything in an account over £10m, so there is no motivation to save. Once the money is back in circulation, other people can earn it and spend it. Also, banks lose the ability to create new money from the reinvested interest. 

No idea if that would work. But the general idea is to get money circulating so it is functional in the economy. ",0,1418151032,null,0,false,0,cmpyfrf,t3_2oqu48,t1_cmpyfrf,t1_cmpvnjd,null,1425521725,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Depending on what you want to do in York, I would say maybe stay over and do 2 days here or cover the Dales, York, Moors railway etc over 3-4 days.
There are some easy hills to go up in the Dales and plenty to see in York.

It would definitely be worth breaking the journey up, long drives are fine now and then but if you're going to be driving for hours at a time and stopping for food, you're going to be sat on a full stomach and doing nothing to work it off, it's uncomfortable and tiring and you won't feel like you've had a break away by the end of it.

false,john_locke1689,,Belfast. Mayonnaise.,"&gt;So who decides this? What instances? The Equality commission? The courts? What constitutes ""In support""? Selling wine to someone off to a gay wedding? Who defines appropriate? What services? This stance is untenable and illogical.

It would be the courts, its their job to determine whether or not someone broke the law. This is all very tricky where best to draw the line, as I've mentioned so I'm not going to come out and say that this is the most practical way of going about it, but having a bill in place that puts the general practice in place and then relying on case law to draw the finer details. Although in the Asher's case it's quite easy as its so explicit.

&gt; Ashers already did take a public stance by refusing to serve a gay customer before the Equality commission stepped in. 

First of all they didn't refuse service to a gay customer, they refused to make a cake with a political message on it.
But this was a stance Asher's chose to make, and it is nobody else's choice what Asher's want to say but theirs.

&gt;The fact the Equality commission got involved doesn't mean they're the ones that made it public. That's a logical fallacy.

The equality commission would have them publicly make a statement through their business that they disagree with. 

&gt;Fair - we both quoted basically half of it. But were Ashers being treated unfairly because a gay man wanted to pay them for a cake? 

No

&gt;Was he using the cake as a subtle ruse to attempt buttsex with them?Was he going to take them out to a disco afterwards against their will and make them listen to the village people? Argue that point out for me, thanks.

No, and at this point you're being facetious and redirecting from the point.

&gt; Nobody is forcing anybody to ""take a stance"" as such, they're telling them to stop discriminating homosexuals and to just bite their tongues, serve their customers and get on with things. 

Well they're not telling them to stop discriminating against homosexuals at all, indeed have they not dropped the accusations of homophobia, if anyone had went into that shop and ordered a ""support gay marriage"" cake then they would have been told the same thing, quite simply it wasn't on the menu. Why should they have to bite their tongue though? Its not the equality commission's job to silence opposition in debate.

&gt;This isn't ""us vs them"" or ""religious vs atheists"" or any other daft dispute, this is a company refusing to serve someone because they're gay. This is not ok on ANY grounds. 

No it isn't, they didn't refuse service on the grounds the individual was gay, and if they did I'd agree it is despicable behaviour.

&gt;Its rather hypocritical too. Do they stop people at the door and ask if they're Muslim and refuse to serve them too? I doubt it. What about followers of Baal? Egyptians? Jewish people? After all, they killed Christ! They're using their religion as an excuse to pick on a single particular subset. It wouldn't be so bad if they were at least going by the entire book but no, they're cherry picking.

Well they don't stop people at the door and make them fill in a form, because they're not refusing services on the basis of who or what the customer is but on what the customer wants. Now if they were also making cakes that read messages that were pro Islam or Hinduism or any other religious statements then I'd say its hypocritical of them and their religious beliefs. 

&gt;And you're saying that's ok.

Of course I am, why on earth would I want a law were you could be legally obligated to support a cause you don't believe in if you were offered to be paid for it.

&gt;You're literally the only person on this entire thread suggesting it's ok. I'd love to know why. 

Because I like the idea of freedom of speech, I like open debate having the ability to say what I please, and if you don't like it you can argue and debate with me. I do not like the idea of having my beliefs bought.

false,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"I'm not really on the right (and I don't agree with their conclusions) but I can understand why people are.

Crime is more likely to happen in poorer areas, certainly petty crime or social disorder. 

Non-skilled immigrants naturally end up in poorer areas so a portion of those immigrants get involved in the crime.

If immigration is high enough that those poorer areas have a sizeable percentages of immigrants then news stories like *""Asian man robs...""*, *""Gang of asian teens attack..""* and so on increase.

Same applies in other areas. Non-skilled immigrants are obviously more likely to claim benefits, more likely to take minimum wage jobs, more likely to sacrifice for family back home, etc. 

If you've lived somewhere long enough to notice a change I think it's understandable that some people come to the conclusions they do. It *would* appear that the unwelcome behaviours are being brought in with the immigrants as opposed to what I think is actually happening which is a balancing of these things across races. Reducing immigration/deporting people wouldn't necessarily reduce crime it might just shift it back to being predominantly white which for whatever reason some people notice less. 

Not true in every case of course, there are legitimate problems but when you have politicians and newspapers stoking these fires then disgusting events like Rotherham come along and appear to justify the narrative in every sense it's difficult to navigate these problems. 

Also doesn't help we have a shite political left in this country that's too spineless to stand up and properly argue the case for immigration but somehow at the same time manage to never concede *any* ground on legitimate issues that should be discussed. 

Outcome is you get people who think immigration is a problem, politicians/media who back them up, scandals that back them up but flat refusal by some people to discuss the issue. So while I don't agree with the extent of their plans or even the conclusions they come to I *can* see how it must feel like they're being shushed for the sake of pussyfooting around and maintaining something that's broken... which may lead some to adopt even more extreme positions.",0,1418154468,null,0,1418154727,0,cmq0jg2,t3_2os7yb,t1_cmq0jg2,t3_2os7yb,null,1425520678,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

**Price of product:** €18 for 150ml

**Where did you purchase:** Kiehl's store

**Product claims:** *This gentle, pH-balanced liquid cleanser produces a foaming lather that cleanses skin of excess oils, dirt and debris. Ultra Facial Cleanser is formulated for all skin types, will not over-dry or strip skin of natural moisture and is tested for safety and gentleness.*

**About you:** Combination skin, oily and bumpy forehead/chin

**Your opinion:** Awesome! It doesn't foam too much, and like it claims, doesn't overdry skin or leave it tight. My skin really improved after only a short time of using this cleanser. Like all Kiehl's stuff, it's quite expensive, but you only need a small amount and the tube is big. My skin isn't too sensitive, but the long ingredients list means it might not be for everyone.

**Price of product:** It was around €35, including v. expensive delivery to Ireland (can't buy in shops)

**Where did you purchase:** PC website

**Product claims:** *Skin looks and feels smooth, soft, and even-toned after it is treated with this ultra-light, water-based gel. Its fast-absorbing formula contains 2% salicylic acid (BHA) for combating blemishes and resistant blackheads. Supplemented with antioxidants and soothing anti-irritants, it also fortifies skin while improving minor redness and irritation.*

*Exfoliates the skin's surface and inside the pore lining where clogged pores occur
Excellent for all skin types, especially normal to oily skin with stubborn blemishes and blackheads
100% fragrance and colorant-free*

**About you:** Combination skin, oily and bumpy forehead/chin

**Your opinion:** Not worth the money! I bought the gel because it's recommended for combination skin, but I hate the texture; it leaves my skin really sticky (it's leave-on). My skin has definitely improved, but not enough to justify the ickiness. There are other 2% BHA exfoliants (like lotions) by PC which I should have tried instead. I will be getting a cheaper alternative in future!

&gt; Early day motions (EDMs) are formal motions submitted for debate in the House of Commons. However, very few EDMs are actually debated. 

&gt; Although there is very little prospect of EDMs being debated, many attract a great deal of public interest and frequently receive media coverage.

Ooooo, public interest and media coverage.  For a popular topic, as _if_ an EDM is what leads to that.

EDMs are either childish nullities, or bandwagon jumping.  They are not required, nor have any effect on actual laws, or even anything debated in the house of commons.  They're a handy way for an MP to say ""well, I have raised the issue as an early day motion in the house"" when a constituent calls them on a tricky topic.  Relying on the fact that your average member of the public has no idea that an EDM is so toothless.

* Dundee Utd, 21/03 (saturday), ko:15:00

* Partick Thistle, 08/04 (wednesday), ko:19:45

So you've picked a decent couple of months to go to a game.

With regards to buying a ticket, they wont go on general sale until February(ish) - maybe mid January. Prices will vary, £26 minimum, though the Aberdeen/Utd games might be a bit more, but not too much more. 

You can create an account and buy tickets [online](https://www.eticketing.co.uk/celtic/default.aspx) and [print them](http://www.celticfc.net/tickets/ticketfast) yourself or pick them up whenever you're in the country (if you're picking up on match day then go well in advance of kick off to avoid queues).

Personally, I would recommend either the Aberdeen or Dundee United game (or both if you're here long enough) if you want to get the most of your visit.

As a language Welsh is dying, I personally think it should be left to die as it's doing more harm than good. If Welsh schools focussed on teaching English our pupils wouldn't struggle as much (I have first hand experience of seeing this in education in Wales).

Those are pretty much the issues that are Welsh specific and I'm not exactly towing the Plaid Cymru party line!

The greens are ahead of UKIP in polls and would legislate for the entire UK not just one part, I would love to see them get more influence and they have more of the size and coverage to do so. If I could my vote would definitely go Green over Plaid Cymru.

Unfortunately for me the Green party doesn't have a candidate in my bit of Wales. Conservatives are out straight away for me and after the student loan farce I don't see myself voting Lib Dem even though I class myself as liberal. I guess this leaves me with Plaid Cymru and Labour, it's then a case of picking the better one for the area out of those two.

false,m1ndwipe,null,null,"&gt; Can someone explain briefly how this became law in the first place. It seems with the level of opposition it's gained we should have heard about it before it became law.

It wasn't debated in Parliament, and it's cunningly not actually written in legislation.

All the act does is compel OFCOM to appoint a VOD regulator who will make ""TV"" like services comply with the existing laws for TV.

That sounds quite innocuous, doesn't it?

Except that Ofcom appointed the anti-porn group ATVOD, who have no democratic mandate (and aren't even subject to FOI), who declared that any web video was TV like. And then they started going after porn sites like there was no tomorrow, citing that these sites would have to pass the regulation for TV like services - i.e. passing the BBFC R18 rating. And the BBFC (another unelected quango) declared that they couldn't pass anything that wasn't allowed under the Obscene Publications Act (despite this being a legally very dodgy claim).

Thing is, the Obscene Publications Act isn't specific. So the BBC then look to ANOTHER unelected quango, but at least one that's part of the civil service - the Crown Prosecution Service, and their guidelines say they believe the items described are illegal under the OPA. Even though they have been unable to secure convictions based upon them for many years, and they themselves have to admit that the current guidance is unsustainable and legally untrustworthy.

So we have a set of guidelines that don't legally work, but are claimed to be legitimate by a quango, which is then taken by another quango, and used to justify an anti-sexuality pogrom because they're run by religious fundamentalists who are very keen on widespread internet censorship.",0,1418159147,null,0,false,0,cmq3gfy,t3_2oqx1x,t1_cmq3gfy,t1_cmq2odt,null,1425519259,11,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,11

As I speak, Markovic has just been sent off for a questionable, confusing ""foul"" but the whole team is playing, and has been playing, utter shite. 
Every time we get the ball, we regress and constantly pass back. There's no forward movement, no momentum and no desire to get into the opposition and score a goal. Rodgers plays a single striker even though it doesn't work, then takes off the only striker at half time and replaces him with a winger. He doesn't even bring our other, fit striker with him, yet we're desperate for ideas up front, but he refuses to accept this and ploughs on regardless. Our defence is a shambles and there's no desire to change this, either, especially with the free passes Lovren seems to get straight into the side. 

I'm angry, anxious and tired, but I stand by my words. Should we somehow win this and go through, I'll still agree with this opinion. Either we've, as a team, regressed so much that a world class manager who has spent hundreds of millions on ""talent"" cannot give us any boost to want to win games, or last season was a blip that was spured on by the best striker in the world scoring goals, and improving our forward line, for fun.

Like I've said else where, we knew full well that this sort if thing was occurring at the time that video was made. The fact that nothing was done about it even then and there is now evidence that it was covered up or ignored is just so incredibly  frustrating.

Although stepping back a bit, they're not 'Muslim rape gangs' at all. The perpetrators are of one particular background in particular which generally places a low value on women's rights.

So going back a bit more. The EDL conflating the situation in Bradford et Al with all Muslims is indeed laughable.

The fact that the police and council have done very little over the decade or more of this taking place is so ridiculous you have to laugh.

That is a fact, being sentimental about the language won't change that fact.

Should we bring back Celtic/Gaelic while we're at it? I don't believe in teaching Welsh any more than I think Celtic/Gaelic should be taught. 1% of Scotland speaks Scottish Gaelic, what number is enough to force it to be taught nationwide?

&gt;Many of our European neighbours speak four or five languages and do quite all right ,if not better than us in the UK

Vast majority don't speak that many and those that can are generally able to do so because of the similarity between mainland European languages. Definitely not the case with Welsh. In said countries you can probably expect the vast majority of the country to be fluent too, not less than 20%...

I was also taught Welsh in primary school and I've done fine too. What's your point? It has served absolutely no purpose to me. If I had done it in secondary school it still would have been of absolutely no use to me.

&gt;&gt;""That all Grants and Promises of Fines and Forfeitures of particular persons before Conviction are illegall and void.""(sic)





&gt;Well it doesn't seem to apply to sanctions.

Someone should bring a test case as they can't revoke the Bill of Rights (as it's Constitutional law, not an ordinary Act or Statute, and as such *cannot* be superseded by any ordinary Act or Statute).

But who among the poor could afford that?

That probably explains why it hasn't yet been tested in court.

I would suggest that anyone being sanctioned should quote the Bill of Rights (1688) and suggest what the DWP are doing is clearly unlawful (no conviction prior to forfeiture (of benefits)) and they should reinstate/pay unpaid benefits accordingly ...

 ... I *guarantee* that it would get passed *quite some way* up the aforementioned Dept's hierarchy (it seems likely that *no* low level civil servant is going to risk their job security over such a decision, and would therefore pass it up the chain) before anyone was willing to say ""yay"" or ""nay"" to it, and as soon as they did, the decision could be appealed and thus forced into the courts (where provision of legal aid would have to become available ""in the interests of justice"" -as clearly the appellant would lack the knowledge/expertise to conduct the case properly)

It's certainly worth a punt, as an individual *can't* be sanctioned for it, and it *might just* get benefit payments reinstated. ;)

Fuck you.  Seriously, Fuck. You.  You're pathetic.  What the fuck happened to YNWA?  We're a team who lost not one, not two, but three of our starting strikers for majority of the season.  We lost Suarez, Sturridge, and now Balo and yet we're still going out and giving everything we have and we're sitting in the middle of the table.  Not the bottom, but the middle.

We're going out against CL teams and we're doing our best.

No, we're not pulling in the results we'd like, but we're hurting.  We've nobody up front but Lambert and Gerrard, both past their prime.  We're a crippled team playing against some of the best in the world, both in the CL and domestically.

So fuck you.

When Rogers has a fully fit team and we're *still* losing games, then maybe, just *maybe* I'll think he needs to go, but until then, fuck you you plastic bandwagon cunt of a ""supporter.""

*edit*

Took a walk.  Been a rough day at work, and then the loss.  Lost my cool.  I won't edit the above because I said it, but I'll try to take a step back.

Right now we are a crippled team.  Losing Suarez was a kick to the knees.  Losing Sturrdige and then Balo on top was just a kick in the nuts.  In BR perfect? Not at all.  Do I agree with all his decisions this year?  Not at all.  Lastly, do I think we should be able to criticize the players/manager/etc. when we don't perform? Abso-fucking-lutely.  

But ...

But saying to ""wake me in five years or when he is gone"" isn't criticism.

You've done nothing to address the snobbishness of this whole post, all you've done is make light of a horrific situation and made fun of a man who speaks a certain way. You can't pretend that the title is an actual critique of the actual intended meaning since you deliberately misrepresented it yourself by copying the misheard version used to scorn a certain type of person and only addressed it in comments when people have rightly pointed out that you're misrepresenting what someone said. 

It bothers me so much when people try to stigmatise and use these sorts of bully tactics to trivialise people they disagree with. Saying that all Muslims aren't rapists doesn't change the fact that the vast majority of those in these gangs were Muslims and so calling them Muslim rape gangs is hardly wrong, though I feel like this is just semantics. I doubt much you'd think him much more intelligent if he had said ""Pakistani Muslims of Kashmiri descent rape gangs"". Most people I know who are concerned about this have never said anything like all Muslims are rapists (I don't think the man in the video did either), but rather that Muslims commit a disproportionate amount of sex crimes and don't respect the native inhabitants of the country.

&gt;There is nothing left to do but laugh. That's all that's left when angry has run out.

There is plenty to do if you cared enough, this looks like an excuse to justify a bad joke.

at least earlier in the season we could bring in borini off the bench, and finish a game with 2 strikers as we always do (cuz we're always losing going into the 70th minute). how he can leave out coutinho is criminal though. He's been probably our second best player this season and the one that actually looks like he can create something besides sterling.

i also feel as if our attitude was just poor coming into the game (just like many games this season), and that ultimately has to fall on rodgers right? he's just not getting the effort out of the players. i keep getting this feeling that there's some sort of power struggle going on and rodgers isnt handling it too well.

if we lose to man united we might go into a free-fall.

Imagine if Pellegrini was to do so, go for broke in the league, and not win it anyway; it probably wouldn't do much good for his job stability. City would have a good chance of winning silverware in the Europa League and the chance they give it a proper shot is feasible.
