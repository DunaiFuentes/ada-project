So he's detained at the school, taken back to the station and put through the charge bar. By the time he goes into a cell that's probably taken atleast 90 minutes because it's so fucking slow.

Then this guy needs an appropriate adult, so police contact an appropriate adult, which will take another hour at the minimum to appear.

Then the cops either have to go and do their enquiry, or as is very likely nowadays, end up getting tied up with other calls because there's not enough officers nowadays to give response cops time to do enquries.

Now 5 hours has passed since you first detained the boy, and depending on what time you got the call, you might not have eaten all day, so you want a meal break.

Then you prepare a quick interview, go down stairs and spend an hour interviewing him. Then an hour later the custody sergeant releases him.

Don't be shocked by hours spent in police custody, it's a slow system and is only made worse by the understaffing of front line policing.

true,majypoo,kernow,Cornwall,"Seasonal work at minimum wage, Cornwall is far to reliant on the tourism industry. 

The county needs a infrastructure overhaul, some of the towns desperately need proper A roads that join the A30 like Wadebridge, Newquay, Perranporth, Falmouth, Looe etc. It's just a pain in the arse getting to them, even the A30 the main road isn't dual carriage all the way. 

Cornwall could do with a new high speed rail line that goes through the centre of Devon not round it, with more connections to a mainline. My town Wadebridge doesn't have a connection anymore. 

The county seems hell bent on building more houses without building the necessary infrastructure to support them, the town of Newquay is the worst example of this. It desperately needs the town centre upgrading and could do with some big chain shops like B&amp;Q, Homebase etc instead of more Supermarkets. 

Cornwall doesn't even have a stadium yet for entertainment or sports, for a county of over 500,000 people it's just poor. 

It will be impossible to stop the rich from buying holiday homes here and driving up the market without putting in buying laws or taxes (can't see it ever happening). So you may aswell make it easier for those people to get down here so they spend more time and money in the county along with the extra tourism.

66 cases (89 vicitims) were in the Parental international abduction category (in contrast with Reunite.org's 479 children reported as parental internation abductions in 2011. 

Some of these cases the Uk remaining parent had given permission for the child to travel overseas and yet they were never returned. 

70% of parental abductions globally are mothers (Lowe 2011) The F&amp;C office report that most abductions to a parental home country occur during the school holidays. and the child it not returned (wrongful retention). 

a third of these victims are white, the other two thirds are of roughly equal ethnicity splits between ""black"" ""Asian"" and ""other"" 

unfortunately for me this particular report doesn't collect the religious or destination data of these cases although reunite.org holds this information as well it's not exactly published as a statistical collection.

&gt;

&gt;The __Heysel Stadium disaster__ (pronounced:Â [ËÉ¦ÉizÉl]; [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language): *Strage dell'Heysel*, [Dutch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language): *Heizeldrama*, [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language): *Drame du Heysel*) occurred on 29 May 1985 when escaping fans were pressed against a wall in the [Heysel Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heysel_Stadium) in [Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels), Belgium, before the start of the [1985 European Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_European_Cup_Final) between [Juventus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.) of [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) and [Liverpool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.) of England. 39 peopleâmostly Juventus fansâdied  and 600 were injured. [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

&gt;Approximately 1 hour before the Juventus-Liverpool final was due to kick off, a large group of Liverpool fans breached a fence separating them from a ""neutral area"" which contained mostly Juventus fans. They ran back on the terraces and away from the threat into a concrete retaining wall. Fans already seated near the wall were crushed; eventually the wall collapsed. Many people climbed over to safety, but many others died or were badly injured. The game was played despite the disaster in order to prevent further violence. 

&gt;The tragedy resulted in all English [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) clubs being placed under an indefinite ban by [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA) from all European competitions (lifted in 1990â91), with Liverpool being excluded for an additional 3 years, later reduced to 1,  and fourteen Liverpool fans found guilty of [manslaughter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manslaughter) and each sentenced to three years' imprisonment. The disaster was later described as ""The darkest hour in the history of the UEFA competitions"".

true,ibpants,1972crest,,"Well it still means wait &amp; see.  What came out today wasn't via any kind of official UEFA press release so offically it means nothing right now, but let's assume that City don't take the reduced settlement and don't opt to appeal the sanctions (one or the other will happen, but let's assume neither happens and City slapped with what's come out today):

1) it means nothing for transfers.  There's no transfer embargo that I've seen mentioned.  Business as usual on that front.

2) it makes no difference.  To my understanding the fine doesn't count as an expense that must be reported to UEFA.  The club's aim has been to break even (FFP has probably rushed the process) and that continues to be the aim.

3) the popular figure doing the rounds is that he spent Â£1bn.  If that's accurate then this fine represents 5% of what has been spent on the club so far.  I don't think that additional 5% is going to be his tipping point, but let's assume it is.  

Firstly there's an agreement in place that he has give us 2 years notice before stepping away, which gives us plenty of time to get our house in order.  Secondly, I don't remember the last time he did a debt to equity transfer, but it's not a regular occurrence.  This means that the club is funding itself - at a loss right now, but the accounts show a positive trend year-on-year and we're expected to break even this year.

4) Probably not much of anything.  We're already signing new players on reduced contracts.  Some of our biggest earners are probably on their way out this summer (Lescott, Barry, et al).

Kate Fox on *Watching the English*:

The reflex apology is just that: a reflex â an automatic, knee-jerk response, not a considered admission of guilt. This is a deeply ingrained rule: when any inadvertent, undesired contact occurs (and to the English, almost any contact is by definition undesired), we say âsorryâ. In fact, any intrusion, impingement or imposition of any kind, however minimal or innocuous, generally requires an apology. We use the word âsorryâ as a prefix to almost any request or question: âSorry, but do you know if this train stops at Banbury?â âSorry, but is this seat free?â âSorry â do you have the time?â âSorry, but you seem to be sitting on my coat.â We say âsorryâ if our arm accidentally brushes against someone elseâs when passing through a crowded doorway; even a ânear missâ, where no actual physical contact takes place, can often prompt an automatic âsorryâ from both parties. We often say âsorryâ when we mean âexcuse meâ (or âget out of my wayâ), such as when asking someone to move so we can get past them. An interrogative âsorry?â means âI didnât quite hear what you said â could you repeat it?â (or âwhat?â). Clearly, all these sorries are not heartfelt, sincere apologies. Like âniceâ, âsorryâ is a useful, versatile, all-purpose word, suitable for all occasions and circumstances. When in doubt, say âsorryâ. Englishness means always having to say youâre sorry.",0,1399419836,null,0,false,0,chbdt8p,t3_24s5w1,t1_chbdt8p,t3_24s5w1,null,1433682373,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

It's a lot of money and it means you can't get a full time job because of uni hours, you can't get a part time job because all the post-grad students will have taken them (at least where I am), and you can't get benefits because you're a full time student even if you only have six hours a week.

I'm certainly not expecting any side to be a walk in the park. Even if we come up against next seasons equivalent of Hyde we'd be one of the teams they take points from. I'm used to losing games we should win on paper.

I do follow the conference from a far and have noticed a lot of the teams who around the top in October - November slip away. I noticed for quite a while Salisbury were around play-off positions but slipped to midtable (still good for your first season).

I have already seen one of those names thrown about on our fans forum - Matthew Barnes-Homer. I honestly doubt we'd try that route. Darrell Clarke should know better than that having managed at a similar level. One of the names being chucked around is Jai Reason who scored 20 goals from midfield for Eastleigh. For the majority of last season Lee Gregory's name had a lot of interest but now we are relegated I'm sure that's a no go.

We have Darrell Clarke as manager who might have some contacts but, if he keeps his job, we also have John Ward as DoF so we might be OK on that front. 

That's been the most consistent bit of advice I have seen - avoid progression in the FA Trophy. Not something I worry about, cup competition in the last few years are not our specialty.

Can't wait to see these refs. League 2 one's are fucking horrendous. 

I'm away on holiday from this Saturday but as soon as I am back I am signing up for the Supporters Club so I can get coach seats for away travel. I'll go to as many as I can.

Players are going to get shit on here. It's one thing our fans are terrible for. Moans before the player even steps foot on the pitch. 

I'm much more positive about it now then I was Saturday at 5pm. Just got to embrace the situation and the club might, if we can make it out the league, be better for having spent time in the conference. 

Doing a Stockport is my worse nightmare. We need to stabilise ourselves financially asap with the new stadium coming. We have already held crunch talks with players and a lot of high earners have been cut loose today.

I'll take your advice on board because hell if you lot did when we screamed at you not to employ Paul 'Brill Cream' Buckle.

I'm not quite sure UKIP deserves the hate it gets. There are loonies here and there but every party suffers from that - Excessive media coverage on a *few* key figures in UKIP leads me to believe the issue is exaggerated and is not as widespread as some would like us to believe. Also, for those that pin UKIP as racist, 2 points!

1) There are no racially motivated UKIP policies. (I always ask personal friends who see UKIP as racist to find one - They never can. It's media and establishment-instilled sentiment I believe.)

true,docmuppet,eng-sussex,(near) Brighton,"Maybe some unis but to be honest most of the top ones are places of research first and foremost, research funding has been cut so they need to recuperate it elsewhere. 

When I first started the course director told us that it cost the university around Â£12k a year per student balanced out across 3 years (over Â£20k for clinical students) so I don't have such a problem with it, especially since you don't pay up front, you get a bigger loan if you need one and a big grant on top of that. My student loan at Â£9k a year ends up at around Â£40k including maintenance loan etc, if you compare it with the rest of the world that's pretty cheap (e.g. american graduates with $200k+) especially since its not taken away from your first Â£21k and doesn't affect your credit rating. All these people who use money as an example of universities being elitist are full of BS, its the people in the middle who are screwed over, the ones whose parents earn too much for the massive grants and increased student loans but not enough to fully support their children at uni.

If the prospect of a huge amount of debt puts you off studying then don't study, I think one of the biggest mistakes made with university education was making it accessible to all, now anyone gets all indignant at this statement I am **not** suggesting that there be a class barrier but an intelligence one, I know people on university courses who got 2 D's at A level and people studying fairly useless degrees, these people are devaluing the bachelors degree. In my opinion the system needs to be changed where entry level jobs don't require a degree, it needs to be something meaningful again.

Now, I've done my fair share of mountain driving in the past, and learned quite a bit from people WAY more experienced than I. Hell, my father worked week on/week off on the highest mountain in the Northeast U.S.. He drove the road to get to the top and back down quite often. My mother drove it and used the correct tactics when she lost the brakes on the family station wagon on the way down one day thereby saving the lives of two year old me and my siblings.

 His recommendation blew my fucking mind and instilled in me the concept that, yes, Bear will fake shit and give DEADLY recommendations if he doesn't actually know what he is talking about.

I was so horrified by this farce that I immediately posted to Reddit.

http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/c65b8/so_reddit_i_am_watching_the_new_show_worst_case/

Bear does have survival skills, don't get me wrong. If the shit hit the fan I'd want him on my side. He simply focuses way too much on the drama aspect for television.

EDIT: I probably should write the correct tactic to use here in case anyone should find themselves in that situation. First and foremost, before you even lose the brakes, DOWNSHIFT! Use the engine to slow your speed just in case. If you do lose your brakes you are already one step ahead of the game AND you will save on the brakes in the first place. At the first sign of trouble with your brakes, DOWNSHIFT MORE!!!! You will hear your engine winding, yes, but would you rather *possibly* lose a little life from your engine or lose your own life?

You may remember me from similar posts I made in [/r/NFL](http://imgur.com/a/oIqbn) and [/r/Baseball](http://imgur.com/a/4k2hx) toward the end/start of each league's season this year, or my future posts in the Premiere League Subreddits.  I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a [script](https://github.com/rhiever/reddit-analysis) made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. The actual word maps were made through [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/advanced). As the /r/MUWs bot only does this in monthly increments, a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as âtheâ, âandâ, âI'mâ, etc. were removed. Numbers were also removed.

A list of the top 1,000 or so items is below the third image in the album.

I am doing one of these for all 50 US states, as well as Washington DC, Guam, Puerto Rico, and several major city subreddits. My current list:

As amazing as a season as this has been I think a lot is due to a perfect storm of sorts with other top teams.  United imploded, Spurs as well, Arsenal had their usual late year run of bad form, but most importantly Chelsea and City have both started a new phase this season with new managers, which probably cost them some points.  If those two reinforce well, like if Chelsea get a great striker for example, and any of spurs, united, Everton, and arsenal have better seasons than this one, it's gonna be tough at the top.

Welfare, including unemployment, social security, incapacity and housing allowances, is pegged at 8.25 percent of GDP; pensions come in at 5.28 percent of GDP.

&gt;Following 1993, welfare started a decline, reaching down to a low of 5.48 percent of GDP in 2002. In the financial crisis of 2008 it increased, reaching 7.38 perent of GDP in 2010. Welfare is expected to decline to 6.5 percent of GDP by the mid 2010s.

Income Taxes. Labour are the party of tax and spend. Taxing the rich almost causes schadenfreude for many Labour supporters. Just before the last election they bumped up the top rate of tax to 50%. Lib Dems see income tax as a necessary evil â they would currently prefer to spread some of the tax load to wealth rather than income. They have championed reducing taxes for the poorest. 

Gay Marriage. Both supported it. I imagine the vast majority of Lib Dems supported it, but much of the core Labour working class vote didnât. I havenât the time to research the history, but I wouldnât be surprised to find Lib Dems supporting gay marriage decades before labour.

Military Spending/Intervention. Labour are, historically, âliberal interventionistsâ. As statists their instinct in to interfere. They argued against getting involved in Syria, though this was more about political point scoring and distancing themselves from Blair, whose Iraq invasion was very unpopular. Lib Dems are more ideologically pacifist, their instinct is to influence from the side-lines. Lib Dems would like to decommission the Nuclear deterrent, and I suspect much of the party would be glad to see massive cuts to military spending. Lib Dems voted against going in to Iraq. 

Currency. All parties now agree we should keep the pound for the foreseeable future. The Lib Dems were historically pro-Euro, but have admited their mistake.

Post. Labour hate privatization of anything on ideological grounds. Lib Dems are not against privatization per se, but had they not been in with the Tories coalition they would likely not have supported the mail privitization given the lack of competition.

Banking. Labour dislike capitalism of which banks are a potent symbol, blaming banks for the crash also distances them from Brownâs involvement. They would happily see the Banks massively regulated. Lib Dems are more pragmatic.

But somehow that's grown into the idea he's a brilliant fullback and completely blameless for any goals conceded. We were 5v3 for their counterattack goal on monday, there's no reason for flanagan not to be much tighter to Gayle. 

Likewise Agger not being in the team has led to the myth of him as a great leader of men, pushing the backline out and calming Skrtel's mind so he doesn't have one of his brainfarts as he did for palace's third goal. Yet the swansea 4-3 happened only 2 months ago, a game in which Jonjo scored from the edge of the area while our defence sat inside the box, and in which skrtel leant on Bony for no reason and conceded a soft penalty. I remember on the anfield wrap they were bemoaning the agger-skrtel partnership after that match, how they don't communicate.

There's myths about Sakho too, that he's this ""beast"" no-nonsense defender who will head all the high balls away but is uncomfortable with the ball at his feet and not the best positionally. Which is wrong. He's decent in the air, but nowhere near the level of Hyypia for example. His huge strengths are his one on one defending and his quality on the ball, and positionally he's good too.

These myths get perpetuated in the media, including by pundits who still have friends in the game and will naturally look to deflect blame from those friends.

So we concede a 9 goals in four matches, its normal to try to find an individual to blame in the defence or defensive midfield. Some of those players have had a great season overall (Skrtel), a magnificent career (Gerrard), or are the new cult hero (Flanagan). So Johnson and Sakho get the blame.

I used to think that was the most likely scenario, too. However, the best counter argument is that no body has been found. When they put their minds to it, the police can be very competent. It's obvious that the McCanns have been the prime suspects from day 1, so their movements &amp; alibis must have been examined &amp; re-examined in amazing detail.

(AUDIO: The Great War) The Doctor claimed that he made this version of the sonic screwdriver to do more than open doors and blow up land mines. (AUDIO: X and the Daleks) It was called a pennywhistle by World War I medics.

I also share /u/Frankeh 's view on chinese imported liqueds and i only buy uk/us manufactured liqueds... anyone wanting to find out more about vaping should head over to [here](http://www.planetofthevapes.co.uk/) or /r/electronic_cigarette 

I also completely support legislation that restricts the sale of vaping products to minors.

if anyone wants some absolutely top class liqueds i would urge you to try these.

Our defensive line isn't even that deep, when the ball is played they're a good 5+ yards outside the box, yet our midfield manages to leave huge space in front. Given that Palace had effectively abandoned midfield at that point, pushing 4 men up and lofting passes from deep I have no idea what our midfield thinks they're going to accomplish by stadning around in the middle of our half - they're not going to interpect passes played over their heads, they're not going to compete for possession as there's no Palace players to compete with. Normally in that situation you'd expect a lofted pass into that area to be attacked.by the DM while the centre backs cover runners.

You are right, the exit has two lanes but the road marking indicate, to my eyes, that the lane to your left expands into two lanes rather than two lanes on the round about both being for that exit.

Given the lane you were in she assumed you were carrying on round. Giving her the opportunity to jump into the lane to your left.

The club apologised for the mistake and Utd accepted, that was the end of it.

These mistakes happen, the faux outrage and the moral highground taking from some supporters who use it to try one up each other is the most pathetic part of it in my opinion.

Of course none of us actually know what exactly happened, but my reasoning is from my experience and believing that people in these jobs aren't stupid enough to jeapordise their career just to try get a one up on other supporters. It would be pathetic/petty to do so and the clubs communications teams know this.

With us no longer chasing detection/figures, the investigating officer can then confidently approach the custody officer and relate the circumstances.

The officer now has to spend upto 3 hours on a phone with a lawyer at the other arse end of the country with absolutely no local knowledge or interest....and then decide that the suspect should be bailed as even though 5 witnesses cannot identify the suspect and will NOT assist the police, their might be cctv .

But if you want to go to St. Austell you will probably have to drive through either my village or the neighbouring one, if you want to go to Truro or further west you either have to drive down the notoriously bad stretch of single carriageway A30 or through a load of hamlets. Basically any town that isn't Bodmin involves driving on shit roads.

Temple is finally being dualled - the council has been pushing for it for a while, the government has finally agreed to flash the cash, and plans are moving.

We need the A30 to be dual carriageway end-to-end, ideally the A38 improved too, and very importantly some serious rail investment in the network west of Exeter. Dawlish (and before this, the Cowley Bridge flooding) would not be allowed to happen if it was anywhere else in the country. But it's fine down here.

&gt; Cornwall could do with a new high speed rail line that goes through the centre of Devon not round it, with more connections to a mainline. My town Wadebridge doesn't have a connection anymore. 

The problem is that any high speed line must serve Plymouth to be in any way viable, and South Devon is unfortunately a heavy population area that wouldn't like to be ignored by any improvement plans. HS3 in an ideal world should run to Bristol/Exeter/Plymouth/Penzance somehow.

&gt;The county seems hell bent on building more houses without building the necessary infrastructure to support them, the town of Newquay is the worst example of this.

Oh hell so much this. My village has numerous new developments. The school is full. The neighbouring schools are full. We are paying for children to be taxied to other schools every day. The water/sewage system can barely take the load. The roads are busy as fuck (mostly from people trying to go to St. Austell or the Eden Project off the A30). Will the council make improvements a mandatory part of development? No. They put an education levy on new houses, but affordable houses don't count, which are most of them.

&gt; The home prices in Wadebridge have risen from 100k to 370k it's a piss take!

My parents' home in this village not far away from Bodmin/Wadebridge has probably doubled or tripled in their ownership (late 80s to today). It is quite spacious due to extensions and has one of the rare things today - a decently sized garden.

A toddler might go looking for you, and then God knows where they'll end up - especially since it seems the apartment wasn't lockable from the outside.

I'm actually of the vein of thought that they gave the kids sleeping pills and Maddy died accidentally as a result, but I still feel terribly sorry for them because they must feel awful.  It kind of stands though - if you don't want to be crucified for something, don't fucking do it to start off with.  They were terrible parents for leaving children that young unattended while they were sitting down, chatting, eating and laughing 50 metres away - completely preoccupied, out of earshot and out of sight.  They deserve to be called terrible parents for doing that.  Doesn't take away from the fact that they were punished horribly for their mistake, but the tragedy that occurred also doesn't take away from the fact that they were flaming idiots who should've known better.",0,1399453848,null,0,false,0,chbpavj,t3_24vi4l,t1_chbpavj,t1_chbp0r4,null,1433687921,6,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,6

Negativity and criticism is part of being a football fan. It's part of the culture. It's not like the eternal optimism of American sports.

Yes it does. I  go to a lot of the games, I go to 'fucking pubs outside Anfield.' The fans I've encountered have not reacted like you. Not sure what the fuck you're on about with regards to Americans Sports either - I couldn't give a fuck about American Sports.

&gt;No, but what we expected doesn't really matter now. We had the title in our hands and we blew it with two winnable games, we really did.

Of course it does. No expected us to win the title, remember that and it will keep you grounded. Winning the league was always a pipe dream. We got close but fluffed it. 


&gt;Yes, we've done magnificently, and I'm extremely proud of the players for their efforts this season.

Finally some positivity. Well done.

&gt;What, you honestly think Gerrard is thinking about how well the team's done this season? Is he fuck. He's hurting because he's probably never going to win the title.

And did you think Gerrard would be in a chance with winning the league this season? It was a big chance, but from what we've seen this season, we'll go again next season. Stop being such a negative twat. Rogers has come out this morning and said we will fight to the end, like I said thank God he and the team do not have the same mindset as you else we'd have fucked up in the league ages ago.


Sometimes you have to accept the positives and not dwell on the one negative that was always a dream anyway. We're in the Champions League, we play fantastic football, have some top players and now have the chance to build our team.

1.) Direct proposition - *""Baguettes, 50p each, Morrisons down the road - Buy it.""* - Simple, obvious, point is to get you in the door. 

2.) Brand Construction - *""I'm a celebrity and I like the friendly staff at Morrisons""* / *""Morrisons is the leading supermarket for animal welfare""* - Establish the brand with happy thoughts, increase the chance you'll choose it. 

3.) Education - ""*Did you know Morrisons sells lottery tickets?*"" - Did to inform of something new they do (Or something they've always done but want more customers to know about)

4.) Brand Establishment - *""Football team sponsored by: Morrisons""* / *""Products covered in Morrisons branding""* - Establish ubiquity, if people see a brand everywhere they will naturally associate it with popularity and popularity associates with 'best'. 

-----

The baguette is 4. It's the hardest to measure in raw numbers but seems to be very effective for large companies as it has been in-vogue since the 80's. It's used when companies have already established a good brand and just want to drill it into your head. The goal is to become *so* associated with something, some word or concept, that your brand jumps to mind before the competition whenever it's mentioned.

We're shockingly simple creatures, our minds take shortcuts.. whatever we think of first or whatever is popular around us is more likely to be the winning pick. So companies manufacture association and manufacture popularity.

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"&gt; Our genes may have a more elevated moral sense than our minds do, according to a new study of the genetic effects of happiness. They can, it seems, reward us with healthy gene activity when weâre unselfish â and chastise us, at a microscopic level, when we put our own needs and desires first.

&gt; It turned out that different forms of happiness were associated with quite different gene-expression profiles. Specifically, those volunteers whose happiness, according to their questionnaires, was primarily hedonic, to use the scientific term, or based on consuming things, had surprisingly unhealthy profiles, with relatively high levels of biological markers known to promote increased inflammation throughout the body. Such inflammation has been linked to the development of cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. They also had relatively low levels of other markers that increase antibody production, to better fight off infections.

&gt; The volunteers whose happiness was more eudaemonic, or based on a sense of higher purpose and service to others â a small minority of the overall group â had profiles that displayed augmented levels of antibody-producing gene expression and lower levels of the pro-inflammatory expression.

true,strolls,null,null,"Apparently, Mr Helmer has been selected for his abilities as a clairvoyant, opening his victim-blaming with the words ""let me make another point which will certainly get me vilified"".

You might ask what point he thought ""important to make"":

&gt; letâs consider two rape scenarios. â¦ The first is the classic âstranger-rapeâ, where a masked individual emerges from the bushes, hits his victim over the head with a blunt instrument, drags her into the undergrowth and rapes her, and the leaves her unconscious, careless whether she lives or dies.

&gt; The second is âdate rapeâ.  Imagine that a woman voluntarily goes to her boyfriendâs apartment, voluntarily goes into the bedroom, voluntarily undresses and gets into bed, perhaps anticipating sex, or naÃ¯vely expecting merely a cuddle.  But at the last minute she gets cold feet and says âStop!â.  The young man, in the heat of the moment, is unable to restrain himself and carries on.

&gt; Let me make another point which will certainly get me vilified, but which I think is important to make: while in the first case, the blame is squarely on the perpetrator and does not attach to the victim, in the second case the victim surely shares a part of the responsibility, if only for establishing reasonable expectations in her boyfriendâs mind.

Neither you nor I have any idea whether Virgin is profiteering or not, but they certainly do make spending and investment decisions based on the income they know they will receive from customer contracts.  To return to the fishmonger example, if I invest in a bigger van based on my contract with you and you decide to bugger off under the proposed consumer protection umbrella then I'm pretty much stuffed.  Why is putting that on to the other party a better outcome?  Again, if you let people renege like this it just means higher prices for other customers so that Virgin can offset their risk.

If you think you might move, don't take out a year-long contract.  Or have a savings account for when things go tits up.  Or don't get superfast (i.e. expensive) broadband if you can't afford it; there are broadband packages where this problem would have been reduced to a fee in the tens of pounds instead.  We can have sympathy for OP's situation, and we can understand that even with the best planning things still go wrong, but that doesn't mean it's Virgin's responsibility to be out of pocket because of it.",1,1399459480,null,0,1399460062,0,chbq5o5,t3_24xrdr,t1_chbq5o5,t1_chbpzct,null,1433688324,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I voted Lib Dem in the last election. Of course I was a student in the last election. Strangely enough, I might have voted for them again, but simply because there's no better choice.

I understand that the concessions they made on many (MANY) of their policies (including the tuition fees fiasco) were so they, the minority in the coalition, could get the AV referendum pushed through by the tories. I don't really blame them for it failing, I blame the stupid public masses who voted against it and are too stupid to see how unfair the current system is. Not that AV would be the be-all and end-all to political corruption and misrepresentation, but it would have been a step in the right direction.

At this point it feels completely pointless in voting, to the point I'll probably end up abstaining entirely. I mean seriously, what are my choices? Labour lost my trust after Tony Blair, and Miliband is a wet lettuce. The tories are just a bunch of rich pricks who have never lived in the real world and have no business representing my interests. No one will ever vote for the Lib Dems ever again so a vote for them is wasted. What's left? UKIP? Yeah, great, let's alienate our closest and most vital trading partners on the continent. Great plan UKIP, that won't backfire *at all.*

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;I don't think it matters whether it's actually a year or not, but it's very easy to take out services with Virgin that amount to Â£60/month, so it's not terribly unrealistic.

Possible.

&gt;Regardless, there is no such thing as a 'punitive' break clause.  They just want him to pay for as long as he agreed to pay at the start.

This has no basis. You don't get paid for not providing a service. I see no issues with an exit charge that would account for unpaid subsidy amortized to the termination date, as that's the limit of what the law in Ontario and Quebec allows for instance. But Virgin isn't entitled to fees for providing nothing.

&gt;Neither you nor I have any idea whether Virgin is profiteering or not, but they certainly do make spending and investment decisions based on the income they know they will receive from customer contracts.  To return to the fishmonger example, if I invest in a bigger van based on my contract with you and you decide to bugger off under the proposed consumer protection umbrella then I'm pretty much stuffed.  Why is putting that on to the other party a better outcome?  Again, if you let people renege like this it just means higher prices for other customers so that Virgin can offset their risk.

Given the market and the reality that yes, people move, it's something Virgin would just have to bear I'm afraid. 



&gt;If you think you might move, don't take out a year-long contract. 

People generally move in year terms, as that's how long most leases run. I think a year contract is reasonable. However if he's moving to an area where Virgin doesn't service, not to say it's Virgin's fault, but OP has no way to know that besides asking them. And I don't want to live in a world where people are so hobbled by internet contracts that they only look for flats in the service area of their providers. That's simply nuts.

&gt; Or have a savings account for when things go tits up.  Or don't get superfast (i.e. expensive) broadband if you can't afford it; there are broadband packages where this problem would have been reduced to a fee in the tens of pounds instead. 

You're taking a decidedly blame-the-little-guy tone, and that grates with me.

&gt; We can have sympathy for OP's situation, and we can understand that even with the best planning things still go wrong, but that doesn't mean it's Virgin's responsibility to be out of pocket because of it.

See, that's the thing. If the next person in that flat signs up for Virgin anything, they're not out of pocket at all. I don't think that's terribly fair.

&gt;Given the market and the reality that yes, people move, it's something Virgin would just have to bear I'm afraid.

But it's not something Virgin 'bears', it pushes off those costs onto other customers.  If I'm a responsible person who plans well, why should I pay for the irresponsible?


&gt;People generally move in year terms, as that's how long most leases run.

Not in the UK.  It's six months most of the time.


&gt;And I don't want to live in a world where people are so hobbled by internet contracts that they only look for flats in the service area of their providers. That's simply nuts.

Seems a bit more nuts to just discard mutually binding agreements because one party ran into trouble that has nothing to do with the other.

It's quite literally entirely OP's problem.  The fact that he is the 'little guy' here is coincidental.  If a storm destroyed Virgin's equipment and this resulted in OP losing service I'd be taking the position that it's not OP's problem and Virgin should deal with it at their expense.

No. A racing yacht is a non materialist object for someone who garners high levels of self pleasure from traveling through stretches of water at  speed. I recently bought a nice car. I love design and very well designed things and have spent hours of pleasure finding out about how individual components were designed, the materials used, features that are common across all cars (of that type). For me there's a lot of pleasure finding the tiny details and evolution of things as small as the volume knob or the complex and incredible properties honeycomb structures made of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers to increase safety and efficiency - it's also REALLY nice to drive and fuel efficient. I'm almost entirely sure that a boat that costs that much would contain a similar life enhancing and pleasure generating experiences for you and owning one would be a dream fulfilled. Plus there's the added 'wow' factor of the object itself. You own a boat like that and your'e not a douche, you have my immediate admiration.

&gt;I don't believe you can classify people as materialists

If you simply wanted a 500k yacht because you wanted to brag to your friends about how much it cost and hardly used it then yes you'd be materialistic. If you buy any object that's not a necessity and it doesn't give you or other people pleasure then it's a materialist purchase and that something that's missed here. How many arguments on Reddit happen over two different brands of phone with features so damn similar it's the cause for massive copyright law suits. Seen the hatred in r/gaming for your set up that many people in the third world would put on par with a Â£500k boat? Those people are very materialistic.

I don't disagree with your points, but your example is one of gigantic proportions - Do you REALLY need that Â£150 pair of shoes or could you give it to a charity cause and get some sweet karma or use it to help train someone who's unemployed get a job? How much happiness are you generating with your money? You find a tenner on the ground... go buy 1 copy of The Big Issue for Â£10 off a seller because ""you seem so nice"" - see how buzzed it makes him (and then you). You could blow it on yourself but for no cost you just made yourself pretty happy. 

&gt; Am I now at a higher risk of developing cancer??

It was my doubt that most parents would happy if their 10 or 12 year old kid was arrested and held in police cells for 9 hours for climbing through an open window of their own school and causing no damage that led me to [respond sarcastically](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/24wfz3/police_detain_downs_syndrome_teen_abdul_alfaisal/chbpxqq) to you. 

But if you think that would be ok, may I ask you to read [this page](http://i.imgur.com/l9KVrLr.png) and [this one](http://i.imgur.com/IoK7Nqr.png), which are taken from a Home Office arrest guidance document [[PDF](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/270303/arrest-guide.pdf)] (although admittedly for immigration officers, it was the first document I found).

Note that that advice refers both to children of around 10 and 12 years old (the mental age of this particular handicapped adult), and to disabled adults explicitly.

It says that:

&gt; Due to the sensitivity of taking a young or vulnerable person into custody [officers] must inform the appropriate Her Majestyâs inspector (HMI) or senior investigation officer (SIO) as soon as possible.

And that:

&gt; Under sections 1.4 to 1.7, Code C of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 [officers] must arrange for an appropriate adult for anyone [they] suspect, or are told in honest opinion, is [a child or mentally handicapped adult].

We can quibble over my definition of [""go gently""](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/24wfz3/police_detain_downs_syndrome_teen_abdul_alfaisal/chbpl56) and yours of [""tread lightly""](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/24wfz3/police_detain_downs_syndrome_teen_abdul_alfaisal/chbpx7b) but, yes, this Abdul Al-Faisal appears certainly in the category where legal obligations of care must be adhered to. 

Judging from all the hassle involved in informing a senior inspector and calling a social worker, it really does seem to me like it would be easier to reserve those kinds of actions for serious crimes, in which some kind of harm or damage was caused. 

When it comes to a child committing trespass, a crime which caused no damage, I might think it'd be easier for the responding officers just to say ""where do you live, son? ok, shall we give you a lift home and talk to your parents"".

When I was a kid, we wandered all over the place, through farmers' barns, the hangars of a nearby deserted airfield and the outbuildings of the local church - all of those were crimes of trespass about which no-one raised complaint.

Frankly, and the more I think about it, calling it ""burglary"" because he climbed through a window, and giving a mentally handicapped kid a caution for it, is starting to sound to me like the cops are just trying to massage their crime statistics. ""Look! we caught a burglar! arrests in this category are up!"" 

None of this was what we were debating when you so confidently clicked reply - we were discussing whether this lad was identifiable to the officers in question as being in the vulnerable category. Everything else depends upon that, and I wouldn't have bothered replying anywhere on this page, had not /u/woocheese so blithely implied that the coppers did nothing wrong because ""these things [only] become clear later on"".

Absolutely, yes, if I see someone who looks like they have Down's, I expect the cops to treat them like a kid getting in mischief in the first instance, and not assume that it's a hardened career criminal with no cognitive impairment. If that assumption turns out to be wrong, then fine, *book him, Danno* but, yes, I think we should refrain from treating the most vulnerable members of our society like they're criminal scum.

It's not that they can't. It's that they don't.

First off, let's get the stupidity out of the way. Calling a white guy cracker or honky is not the same as calling a black guy a nigger or a brown guy a paki. Why? Because of historical and social context.

Now, show me a case of a white person suffering racism and I'll show you 100000 cases of the opposite. It's not that an individual person can't suffer discrimination, it's that as a whole (macro), white people don't suffer racism because they are in a system that benefits them. Racism is a system that benefits one group of people for their skin colour/ethnicity/culture/religion and hinders any others. In most developed nations, like mostly all of Europe and North America, this is for white people and against anyone else.

If a black person says ""I don't like white people"" is it prejudiced? Yes. Is it racism? No. Because they are in no position of power to stop you from doing anything. They do not have the majority population to persecute you. They can't stop you from getting a job. They can't stop you from being served. Etc etc.

The 13-year-old got to wear it a few days later when she set off from her home in Whiston, near Rotherham, to visit her aunt seven miles away in Bramley. She had been planning to stay for a few days, but knowing her grandfather was working a night shift the teenager decided to go back to keep her grandmother company. Anne had moved in with her grandparents following the death of her mother a few years earlier and witnesses remembered seeing a young girl standing near the bus stop shortly after 9.15pm on the evening of May 6.

No one quite knows what happened next, except Anne, who spent most weekends with her father in Sheffield, never got on the bus. The following morning her naked body was discovered at the foot of a pile of manure near a winding country road between the villages of Carr and Slade Hooton.

Anne, a pupil of Wickersley Secondary Modern, had been sexually assaulted and strangled by her own stockings. A few days later her new coat, along with her cotton dress, was recovered by frogmen from the bottom of Utley Reservoir, six miles from where her body had been dumped.

In the days after the grim discovery Det Chief Supt Clifford Lodge, who believed Anne may have accepted a lift from a passing car, described her killer as a âmenace to childrenâ. As more than 70 officers were searching nearby fields for clues, he also issued an appeal to âcourting couplesâ who might have used the secluded lane that night, assuring any information would be treated with âabsolute discretionâ.

The officers never did find Anneâs wicker shopping basket or the headscarf printed with a distinctive vintage car design. Despite some early leads they also never tracked down her killer. The case is now the oldest unsolved murder on the books of South Yorkshire Police and on the 50th anniversary of her death, her older sister, Irene Hall, still believes that someone, somewhere knows who killed Anne.

âMy father always wanted to know who could do such a thing before he passed away, but he never got to know,â says the 68-year-old, who now lives in Worcestershire. âIâd like to see the killer brought to justice too, but Iâm not getting any younger. If I donât, then the burden will fall to my children.

âGenerations come and go, but Anne will never be forgotten. My family and I have been robbed of watching Anne grow up, get married and have children. We are only left with the memories of a happy young girl who did not deserve to be taken from us at such a young age and the question: `Why? Why did this have to happen to Anne?â",0,1399466472,null,0,false,0,chbrni0,t3_24y3ok,t1_chbrni0,t3_24y3ok,null,1433689029,2,false,yorkshire,t5_2rz9n,2

Does this seem reasonable to you ?

In our courts the fines are based on your income and you're usually not fined more than you could pay back in 12 months (compensation is different).

Rodwell - 6/10. Has been warming the bench at City, but with UEFA slapping them on the wrists, we could be looking at them fiercely holding onto any and all British players currently poking around the Etihad. 

Cleverley - 7/10. The next United boss is going to have Abu Dhabi-esque money to chuck about and the chances he's not going to fall down the United pecking order are slim. Coupled with Martienz's compliments and Catalan charm, a move to the right side of Stanley Park should be in order.  

Welbeck - 5/10. Will probably depend on other deals for stirkers, but unlike Cleverley, Welbeck might be harder to pry away from Old Trafford considering he worked his way through the academy. 

Batshauyi - 5/10. Cheap and scoring goals in Belguim - something Rom and that decent Benteke lad know all about - but paper talk had him talking up Arsenal and Wegner loves not having to spend more than a packet of crisps if the fan's aren't complaining. 

Bony - 5/10. Should have brought him last year, as he'll probably command a few extra million now. 

Remy - 3/10. Another one the Gooners are after and having popped his head in at the Emirates at the weekend, will almost certainly be banging goals in for them next year

Lukaku - 4/10.

true,imhighnotdumb,eu,Stealing your jobs and women,"Who gets mental illnesses and cancer from smoking cannabis? The 'psychosis' like episodes some get are mainly caused by the fact that the substance is indeed illegal. And cancer comes mainly from smoking it with tobacco, which people do mainly as the price is too high (again to do with legality status). If anything a lot of users find the calming effect help with their anxiety.

As for the stoned drivers argument I believe if you're the sort of person to drive under the influence you'd probably do it whether the substance is legal or not. Not many people who don't already drink drive or drive after smoking would decide that it's a good idea only because it's legal (plus the act of operating a vehicle in a state would still be illegal).

Plus you fail to mention one of the biggest issues - pointing a finger at otherwise perfectly normal law abiding citizens like they're the scum of the earth. I know this is not as prevalent in the UK as it is in the US and other places but still if one of the biggest downsides to using a substance is that it turns you in a criminal there surely is a problem within the law.

You're right, I can't assert anything; however research can.

so the real problem is that he should have found a cheaper school for his kids that wouldnt cripple him financially  He also appears to be terrible at maths when he goes

uh no , you've GAINED Â£27k a year in school fees you arent paying. Now as /u/SteveD88 pointed out he needs 33k to clear his mortgage over 13 years. However even if the boys are at uni for 5 years, and he pays their fees etc, he'll still have more than enough to clear the loan off in the remaining 8 years once they graduate.

true,Gorgash,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"If anything it's the lobbyists I'm worried about. Big tobacco companies consider e-cigs a threat because they're vastly cheaper than normal cigarettes and may help smokers to stop buying them. So these big tobacco companies might start spreading false information about e-cigarettes and I wouldn't be surprised if they already were. I have a friend who is convinced that e-cigs are actually *more* dangerous than real cigarettes. Maybe she's just trying to fool herself because she can't stop smoking, but I couldn't help but gawk at her when she told me that e-cigs had more cancer-causing agents than normal cigs.

Plus if big tobacco is lobbying the government for tighter control over e-cigs, the government might only be more than happy to comply. After all, cigarettes are a big source of tax revenue for the government and they're going to consider that far more important than peoples' health (never mind the fact that less smokers would ease up the strain on the NHS's resources, but the government wants to privatise the NHS anyway so they don't care about that).

I'm not sure about people having the ""right"" to vape in the office. People aren't allowed to consume alcohol in offices. That said, nicotine isn't a mind-altering drug in the way alcohol is and nobody objects to people drinking cups of tea/coffee (caffeine). Maybe you shouldn't have to go outside to vape, but I'd still consider it courteous to at least do it away from other people.

Ultimately while I want e-cigs to remain easily available to help more smokers get off real cigarettes, I do agree advertising them needs some rules. They shouldn't be advertised as ""healthy."" They *can* be advertised as a ""healthier alternative to smoking"", but that's it. They should still have warning labels that they contain nicotine and should only be sold to people over 18. Most of all they should only be advertised to people who presently smoke. I have another friend who never smoked a regular cigarette in his life but took up vaping, which is just outright moronic. He likes all the modding and the different e-liquid flavours though...

While I certainly disagree with the premise of blame the above distinction could be relevant for the purposes of sentencing. One could surely argue that a Judge might sentence these two cases differently. In that the mindset of someone who would prey on and rape strangers is more dangerous to society than the rapist who wouldn't take no for an answer. Don't get me wrong, both cases are rape but is it worth distinguishing between the two? (aka: stupid questions)  
If we're going to continue to stumble into awkward territory then what would be (legally) the last point at which you could legally state ""stop"" prior to it being rape? All these details are a highly awkward conversation and trying to understand them through stupidity (e.g. say something dumb, get corrected) isn't as socially acceptable on this topic as it is on others.

Its a very tricky and touchy subject to discuss and while I appreciate these portly white men are often ill-equipped to discuss the issue it is also a minefield for them where treading incorrectly is political suicide.

&gt; Re: Extension of Petroleum Exploration Licence PL2/10

&gt; Thank you for your recent letter regarding the decision by Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Arlene Foster to extend Petroleum Exploration Licenses here from March 31st 2014 to September 30th 2014. 

&gt; With reference to Mr Agnews tabling of a Petition to Refer a Ministerial Decision to the Executive Committee, Sinn FÃ©in were not afforded adequate time to organise members signatures. 

&gt; Sinn FÃ©in opposes hydraulic fracturing and shares your concerns about the potential damage it could pose to the environment. At our most recent Ard Fheis Sinn FÃ©in delegates passed a motion in opposition to fracking and pledged our full support to the communities who are opposed to this unsafe process. 

&gt; The licence granted is not for fracking, but rather for the purposes of exploration which can be used for petroleum and other materials. Given the cross cutting and significant nature of this matter, any application for actual fracking to take place in the north will come before the Executive. Sinn FÃ©in will oppose any proposal at the Executive to carry out actual hydraulic fracturing on the island of Ireland in accordance with our party policy. 

&gt; Is mise le meas,

&gt; Chris Hazzard MLA

This is bullshit for a number of reasons. The licence is for shale gas exploration. Whilst it isn't out and out fracking, they are exploring the area and testing the shale rock for suitability. It's an early step before extraction, which will involve fracking.

Also, they said they didn't have time to organise signatures! They have six more days to do so! Can't they send an email round? A text?

We really don't like dry casks becoming wet casks, especially if they contain some uranium smears (very possible) or Magnox swarf...the swarf forms a magnesium hydroxide and breaks up into a fine and annoying powder and the uranium ends up generating hydrogen which is not a huge concern if the casks are kept in an inert atmosphere (generally argon).

A very hot fire can start if this is then exposed to air which can be pretty hard to put out.
In other words, generally we don't worry about fission happening again (though that is taken account of by the concentration of waste in these casks), we worry about metal fires which can damage casks significantly.

Ever see a high earning black footballer quit the game because the racism was *so* bad? No. These guys are not affected by it. They are simply earning too much money to quit.

In addition they are afforded enormous protections in the situations you described - support from team members, team management, and the football association as a whole.

The fact that each event makes the news every time illustrates how rare such events occur.

Meanwhile there are people that are targeted on the streets because of their colour by gangs or opportunistic individuals - with real physical violence either threatened or executed.

As for whether people are being passed over for management because of their skin colour - I doubt very much there is any evidence to support this theory apart from wild emotional (and quite frankly - incredibly selfish) motives.

I can't believe you actually think rich black footballers - who probably have fucked more white women in their careers than most white men would actually meet - deserve any kind of pity.

true,thecritic06,cnty-wales,Aberystwyth Yorkshireman,"&gt; but that is hardly a negative of Capitalism- rather one of its many benefits that living standards may improve so quickly. 

I'd debate this. Many potentially life-improving technologies are suppressed or neglected because it's not profitable to develop them. People die because they don't have access to medication Pfiser or GlaxoSmithKline charge extortionate amounts of money for - capitalist corporations did not fund the eradication of smallpox, governments did. Proprietary technologies, which can be copyrighted and controlled, make life harder than it needs to be. Capitalism is as much an enemy of innovation as it is a friend. Capitalists are much better at thinking up applications for technology than they are inventing new things. The bleeding edge of technology is often in research university labs and in governmental or intergovernmental bodies or organisations funded by government.

&gt; And as for your first paragraph, that is correct, people will charge what they can. But Capitalists and corporations are no unified cabal- the syndicates of the 1890s existed because single individuals often owned entire companies. **In the modern day corporations are more than happy to undercut their competition**, leading to further undercutting and further price drops, as is happening in everywhere from televisions to space rockets today. Indeed it is so commonplace that when 'trusts' do arise (ie with the US cable industry) it causes a massive ruckus. 

This is a more gradual process than it need be, because people still want to profit. If your smartphone undercuts the competition by Â£50 you're possibly (but not always) onto a winner. That doesn't mean you aren't charging hundreds of pounds more than manufacturing, labour and R&amp;D costs. Moreover, companies *constantly* introduce products that do *not* undercut their competition. As I said re: scarcity, commodification and artificial scarcity are ubiquitous and often more profitable tactics.

&gt; We live today in an evolution of 50s and 60s social democracy

On which there are constant ideological and financial attacks. The economic policies of all three large parties in the UK tend towards varying degrees of [neoliberalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberal_economics).

I don't know quite why you think I am advocating violent revolution. I haven't done so at any point during this conversation.

&gt; It seems to me you have a rather pessimistic view of the future. Food, resources, luxury goods, shelter, is in more abundance than ever before. We are approaching an age of ever cheaper energy, and after 50 years in the shitter, even Fusion energy is going places. 3D printing will revolutionise manufacturing, millions are lifted out of poverty each year, diseases are being cured across the world... etc.. We're finally thinking about going back to space. I don't know about you, but I often wake up and wonder what a time it is to be alive! The most exciting age in human history so far, that's for sure. 

I don't deny that these things are happening. I'm saying that these things are happening slower than needs be, and people are suffering as a consequence. As I've said, Basic Income is a step forward but it is insufficient. It is not the final step on the ladder. The continued legality of profit only results in continued uneven distribution and wastage of resources which ought to be enriching people's lives. Capitalism is half of the world's food being thrown away whilst millions die of starvation. Supermarkets throw away tonnes of food so that consumers can choose between this and that near identical loaf of bread or bottle of milk. The supermarkets profit, the manufacturers profit, and people starve and die.

true,Omar612,null,null,"Here's what I wrote previously on this matter:

I grew up in a very multicultural area. In my school year of 60, there were probably 3 white kids. The rest were from various different ethnicities. Everyone got along and to be honest, I didn't even know what racism was.
Since our area went to shit, when I was 8 my parents moved us to the country. We went from the inner city, worst neighbourhood in the country, to the countryside. Needless to say, everyone was white.
My new school only had 16 people in my year, all white. Most of them had never seen a brown person before. When all the questions came: what race are you? What language do you speak? What religion are you? Do you believe in god? I didn't chalk it up to racism, just curiosity.
Here's where it starts, three of the boys from three years above me started bullying me. Pushing me around, calling me a paki, telling me to go back to Iraq, taking my religious artifact and throwing it over the school wall. People saw but did nothing. I told my parents who talked to the head teacher. To his credit, he really tried to help. He held assemblies on racism and how it's unacceptable. Unfortunately he left a couple of months after I started. In came Ms. Muntonâ¦
The boys denied it, and one of their mothers actually came in to the school, mad at how he had been accused (""my son would never do that!"") my parents didn't really do much else to help which is ironic because my mum worked in race relations at the time. The school did nothing as I technically didn't have any evidence. It only stopped after my sister asked her friend from the local secondary school to have her brother (he was a big guy) tell them to stop, but there was only a few weeks left of school and they were moving to secondary school. All in all, it lasted about a year.
The next year, this boy had some sort of racist vendetta against me, he tried to get me into trouble loads of times (he told our teacher that I said ""Christians, who needs 'em!"" who talks like that!? And I was surrounded by christians, why would I say something that would piss off everyone around me?). I said he was racist and of course was calleed out for ""playing the race card"". The school called in a charity organisation that dealt with racist incidents to mediate between us and they were less than useless. The school unofficially took his side, including my head teacher grabbing me by my collar and slamming me against a door for calling him stupid. eventually, he left, so that was the end of that.
My anger from all this led to me getting into trouble. For the next two years, I got in trouble over and over again. Eventually I was suspended... On my birthday. I had become a bit of a pariah and had gotten used to spending breaks on my own.
Other than that, not much happened until I left the school, besides some kid calling me a black bastard, and a teacher comparing the word black in spanish (Negro) to what you would call a coloured person. Needless to say, I was not sad to leave and made sure to be absent for the leavers ceremony.
Then came secondary school. Out of 1500 students, probably &lt;20 brown people. It was not as bad as my primary school. I had a lot of dirty looks, some stones thrown at me. And the odd ""Paki"" thrown around from a distance.
There was lots of institutional racism, my sister was racially bullied by her PE teacher and English teacher. A boy once blocked the ntrance to a building, waving the Union Jack flag. He wouldn't let anyone in unless they sang God Save the Queen. Surprise, surprise! He wouldn't let my sister in, even after she sang the national anthem. The PE teacher said he was simply ""patriotic"". The English teacher had a vendetta against my sister, she screamed at her for nothing, all while joking and chatting with the boy that did no work and had his feet up on the desk every lesson. She always sent my sister out of class, and even had our home phone number posted to the wall in her office. Eventually it took other students intervening for her to ease up.
I had had a teacher ask me ""where I'm from"" and seem surprised when I said England. I once had a guy sat behind me on the school bus call me a terrorist and say that I probably had a bomb on the bus, and everyone rushed to defend him when I refused to let him sit nect to me afterwards. I had my sisters old English teacher move me down to mixed sets even though I was in the top set the last year and got one of the highest grades. I had a girl in my year call me a paki and when I refused to talk to her and called her a bitch, had her friends tell me off for not getting over it. She then tried to mock me by calling me her best friend and incessantly adding me on facebook.
Half way through secondary school, I moved back to the city, to a school with a healthy racial mix so racism wasn't as much of a problem. There were still some racists who said racist things, but it wasn't a case of ""me against the world"" anymore.
Sorry for the wall of text, but that's my story from the ages of 8 to 14. I'm turning 18 tomorrow. And for the most part I've moved on. My relationship with my parents is rocky at best, mainly due to how they did almost nothing to help me, never followed up, supported the school (saw me as a problem child), and refuse to admit that they could have handled it any better. I'm still untrusting of white people and don't have many white friends.
I'm stronger for it all though. I'm glad I went through it so my future children won't have to. The main thing I've learnt is that my kids will grow up in the city in multicultural areas/schools and I will never move them.

I'm not gonna read through all that but I would assume that I left out most of the dirty looks, bad service, slurs, etc. That's just my life btw, I volunteer for an anti hate crime charity that has a case or two* for you.

Just off the top of my head is the mentally disabled man in my city who filmed some girls as evidence of them destroying his property. The girls lied and said he was a paedophile. So what happened? he was burned alive. Or the Muslim woman who had her hijab pulled off by three white women. Or the Sikh man who had his turban pulled off and set on fire by 5 women and the police didn't even arrest them?

These comments of Helmer's were made at the time to the Kenneth Clarke furore, and in response to it, but Clarke's words had a somewhat different nature.

When Clarke spoke he referred to ""17-year-olds having intercourse with 15-year-olds"", implying that it was a less serious crime, or worthy of a shorter sentence, *except that* he mistakenly described this as ""date rape"" (instead of ""statutory rape"" as the Americans, at least, cal it).

This was the most significant aspect of the Clarke controversy - two mistaken words taken out of context - and it overshadowed everything else he said in that interview.

In fact everything Clarke said was pretty reasonable and, whether or not you agree with the sentencing policy he was defending, he spoke of a concern not to make rape survivors relive their experience on the witness stand, to save them the distress of being called liars by defence barristers. 

If you read [Clarke's full comments](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13444770) then I hope you'll agree that they have quite a different nature to the defence of poor young men who are ""unable to restrain"" themselves ""in the heat of the moment"".",0,1399470507,null,0,false,0,chbsxei,t3_24xco7,t1_chbsxei,t1_chbs7zb,null,1433689631,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

However, our presence inside the Eurozone would probably have helped stop a lot of the lax sovereign debt practices of Portugal/Ireland/Spain/Italy, so that part of the crash might have been partially avoided.

Probably, yes. He was fantastic last season but Bacuna's been pretty good this season, as we discussed last weak. It's a shame 2 of our best players are both RBs. I do think Lowton deserves to play more though, he's defensively stronger than Bacuna.

What, in your opinion, are his main strengths and weaknesses?

Unlike Bacuna, he's a more traditional RB. He's better defensively than Bacuna but weaker going forward. Saying that, his goals against Swansea and Stoke were pretty incredible, the latter being the league's Goal of the Season IMO.

What is his best position (i know, duh), formation and team?

Left wing. Nah, Right Back of course. I think he favours a back 4, when he plays when we have a back 3 he's either put out of position in CB or given out entire responsibility for going forward on the right, which doesn't suit him. Bertrand/Okore/Vlaar/Lowton is a solid defence.

Is he good enough for Villa?

Yes. Last season proved he's good enough. He's a player that would still be important if we were to challenge for Europe again.

Should he stay or would his career benefit from a move?

I'd like him to stay. He's a good young player with a bright future so, of course, we want him. He's probably, after Vlaar and Okore our best defender defensively (not inclusing ability to go forward). However, if Bacuna is going to continue to be first choice, he probably deserves better than to sit on the bench.

it's their job. They are under contract firstly. Secondly, it's mostly likely their only skill. Most footballers are not qualified for anything other than a minimum wage job.

They are affected by it. Players have started to walk off the pitch. The only reason they didn't do it before was because of the institutional racism in Fifa where *they* would be the ones punished for refusing to play.

&gt;In addition they are afforded enormous protections in the situations you described - support from team members, team management, and the football association as a whole.

They don't get support. They are pressured by teammates, management etc to ""just let it go"" and ""just get over it"" it's funny that when hong terry and Luis Suarez were racist, it was only the black teammates who stood up for the victims.

Sorry that you apparently have no problem with, or even a belief that racism exists.

&gt;As for whether people are being passed over for management because of their skin colour - I doubt very much there is any evidence to support this theory apart from wild emotional (and quite frankly - incredibly selfish) motives.

You *doubt* it. Oh that's fine then. Throw all the research and personal experience away. This guy doubts it. There's a lot of evidence, just go to google or read a newspaper.

&gt;I can't believe you actually think rich black footballers - who probably have fucked more white women in their careers than most white men would actually meet - deserve any kind of pity

Oh yeah, that's right because white women are the ultimate prize, gotcha!

&gt;Especially when you label all white people as ""open season"" for hatred and violence from people who are non-white.

I never said any of that. At all.

&gt;You seriously scare me with your supremacist and racist views. I think you need to pray to your God - and seek forgiveness - while acquiring humility and a desire to understand points of views that are not your own self-centred ones.

Lol good one mate, there's only one supremacist here, and it ain't me.

What, in your opinion, are his main strengths and weaknesses? Strengths are interceptions, keeping possession and crossing. Weakness is defensive play - marking, tackling, positioning, heading. He can also be caught out physically. Confidence is the key issue. When he's lacking confidence he looks a really poor player, wheras Bacuna doesn't seem to get affected by it as much.


What is his best position (i know, duh), formation and team? Right back or right wing back in any formation. **Not** centre back in any formation.

Is he good enough for Villa? I think so. He was brilliant at the end of last season and showed he had talent, but this season he has not been nearly good enough. He really must do a lot better next season.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Anarcho Syndicalism doesn't work in an automated world.  Because I can start my 'syndicate' worker-owned business with me and Pete, and 250 machines, and make hundreds of millions.  And as long as we split those hundreds of millions equally, that's technically 'OK'.  So under anarcho syndicalism yes workers would own businesses, but that doesn't mean the impact of automation would hit any less hard.  Indeed in many ways if you're following the ideology to the letter, it would hit a lot harder than in a social democracy. 

Thinking up applications for technology is necessary though.  Smartphones would never have been invented in a State Socialist society, because normal phones are 'good enough'.  Better cars were never invented, because the shitty cars they had were 'good enough', and it wasn't like people had a choice anyway.  Capitalism took technology from many different sources, some of them state funded (by taxes the capitalists had often paid), and turned them into things that made people happy and in many cases their lives easier.  They still do.   If someone makes something I want or enjoy using, then I am happy for them to 'profit' off of my money and go live in a nice house if they so choose to.   Perhaps that's just me. 

EDIT: Capitalism is not the reason people throw food away.  In the wealthier Communist countries (East Germany, Yugoslavia) there was huge wastage as well.  Food being wasted is the result of poor transport connections allowing it to go bad en route to its destination, and the fact that we always think we need more than we do.  It has very little to do with capitalism.  If you really think no one would throw away food in a socialist/anarchist society you're deluded.  People would go to the local 'food store' and take double what they need, 'just to be safe' and then throw the rest out too.   Our eyes are always bigger than our stomachs so to speak. 

And also, no one has to die in the UK of starvation right now, regardless of supermarket profits.  If you think that you're absolutely deluded.

Contextual menus frequently fail to display until you hover over an item in them. This might be due to some of the software I have on here, as I have some things which try to mess with Windows' default handling of multiple monitors.

I mentioned it has problems starting up. Most of these are simply failed boot - it goes to a black screen and stays there - but about one in 30 goes to a screen full of graphical artifacts and nothing else. About as often, sometimes the GPU fan (pretty sure it's the GPU anyway) decides to run at full speed immediately upon boot. If this lasts about 3 seconds I just power cycle it and it behaves.

In both of those cases, simply rebooting it fixes the issue. The usual problem seems related to the motherboard (occasionally it's nice enough to report a Hyper Transport Sync Flood Error but the common fix for that didn't seem to have any effect for me). More interestingly, the problem seems to be a matter of temperature - if I restart quickly after one of these happens, it usually happens a second time but works on the third. If I wait a bit, leaving it at the black screen for a minute or so, it usually works on the second try.

At 21 of course he's going to make mistakes, of fucking course he's not going to be 'champions league quality' or the 'complete package' *yet* but that'll come with more playing time which is what he's getting now and he's done exceptionally well given the situation, so its strange to me when people say he's done well and *could* become a regular when he's been brilliant and is going nowhere.

For others, Communism in itself is exploitative (ie ""I shouldn't have to work to subsidise others who can't/won't"").  Most people settle somewhere in between.  

A 'rigged' system implies, to me, a system that is impossible to win, like those ladders they have you climb at amusement parks that are balanced so they always flip over and you never get the prize.  

Capitalism is different.  It is a system in which most people (almost all) can technically succeed, but those from certain backgrounds have higher chances than others, chances we have been attempting to mitigate over the past 40 years, but yes, can never get rid of entirely.    Opportunity is not equal in our society, though it is certainly more equal than it was, for example, a century ago. 

I personally believe that it is worth the lack of equality of opportunity to ensure a degree of economic freedom that prevents state or government control over most means of production and exchange.  I also believe that the market is a superior method for the distribution of goods than a command economy, at least for the time being.   

Every system is 'rigged' in a certain way.  Unfair advantages exist because of our looks, our intelligence, our families, our backgrounds, whether or not we have ADD, etc...  Wealth is just another thing on that list.

If so, possibly a level of English that's only just good enough to do their job may well fall down in an emergency - just when clarity and speed of communication are most important.

We should require people to be able to speak better english than 95% of their job requires so that when that 5% comes along an avoidable tragedy is, well, avoided.

true,rockstarsheep,eng-Oxfordshire,London,"Thanks for elaborating. Much appreciated. My thoughts as such. I do feel that one should be free to dispose of their income as they see fit, according to their means and their responsibilities. This seems fair to me. As most people are not precisely rolling in dosh, particularly as wages in real terms, have been depressed for quite some time now, the majority is not really lording it up. Not as far as I can tell. We aspire to have an equitable society, however this is a bumpy ride, which has taken twists and turns as the world has changed. Now when it comes to developing nations. Well this is tricky. There is indeed a great deal of corruption to deal with, in regards to getting those in power or with influence and quite often, with means, to allow external support, in the form of development. In health, education, infrastructure and economics. Extracting their kickbacks, needs to be calculated as a cost. Lost opportunity to many though. Which to my mind, asks why there's been little investigation on the ""1%"" of these developing nations and the inequality that their particular regimes bring. My guess is it is far more startling, relatively speaking, than what we find over here. 

Anyway, on a personal note, I don't donate or send any clothes to Africa. Why? Well, it kills off local manufacturers - big and small - which means fewer jobs to support the local people and their economy. Added to this, there's a responsibility that people in developing nations need to take up for themselves. The rights won here, came through a lot of sacrifice and bloodshed. It wasn't a pleasant affair. I'm not advocating this in other countries per se, however they too may need to start doing something for themselves than waiting for hand outs.

Apparently when Cardiff bought Caulker, we insisted on a 20% sell on clause which means whenever Cardiff sell him we'll get 20% of the fee they sell him for.  This means if they sold him for Â£10m, we would receive Â£2m straight from the buyer.

Obviously if we buy him, then the sell on clause still applies so if we agree to pay Â£10m, we would get Â£2m back meaning we really only pay Â£8m for him.

If we have first refusal, it also means that if Arsenal or Liverpool decide to put a bid in, Cardiff have to tell us and we can choose to try and compete (obviously Caulker could still turn us down) or not.

Simply put, he's great at reading the game from a deep position and has a brilliant defensive mindset, but being deployed further forward in a dynamically-challenging role it advocates his weaknesses rather than his strengths.

Many will need to jump quite quickly back into longer term renting, so my tip would be to save up and grab a Buy To Let or two in anticipation of the bubble bursting (or shrinking) and then gear your investments and set up to become a Landlord ready for the 2016 -2025 rental boom, as I anticipate the markets will work that way.

In IMTKOTC, you're better off doing the * question. You should know relevant quotes, or at least roughly know them, to answer questions. Immediately look at the literary devices (metaphor, symbolism, personification etc) and pick out the best quotes that are relevant for the answer.

With poetry it's really quite simple. Just look at each line, and ask yourself: what does this remind/show/make me imagine, and write it down.

Just to check, visualise your point in your head and then ask yourself: does this fit what the question is asking?

The care industry is in desperate need of more regulation for a number of reasons. The RGN all meet a minimum English standard (like on you suggested) as its a prerequisite for a valid nursing qualification here, the home itself and its managers are held accountable by the CQC but while the CQC can punish care assistants (with fines and jail terms) there is no regulations for joining the profession beyond having a CRB check clear of anything related to vulnerable people. The lack of formal training given to new care assistants is very low as well and is more geared to avoiding law suits against the home than protecting carers and residents, everything I learnt about being a care assistant was unofficial and from my seniors on the job. If there was a proper regulatory body (or maybe even the RCN could extend to covering us) then I think the standard of care assistants would go up and therefore so would the standard of care. The home I work in is superb when it comes to looking after the residents and has a perfect CQC record but we all know of the homes that have been in the news recently for doing terrible things, regulation and registration needs to be extended to care assistants not only for English language requirements but also for a higher standard of carer employed in the industry. The problem is all of this would require a fair amount of extra work for us care assistants and being registered professionals we would (rightly in my opinion) be able to ask for a higher than minimum wage.

&gt; Fracking means delightful mini-earthquakes.

[Yes](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/283837/Seismic_v3.pdf) but any such earthquakes are roughly magnitude 2 or less on the Richter scale in a tectonically inactive like NI. In comparison, a truck driving past your house would be around a magnitude 3.

&gt; Fracking means explosive taps.

Aah Gasland. See my response to the first point. It is also worth noting that this was possible long before fracking became a thing, as many improperly bored wells are susceptible to methane pockets. 

The reality of the situation is that fracking is perfectly safe, if done in a controlled and properly regulated fashion. A lot of the horror stories surrounding fracking are coming out of the US, where it is simply not properly regulated.

Fracking is of course a short term solution. Right now, renewables such as Wind, Solar, and Tidal do not and cannot provide sufficient power generation capacity for our needs. One significant disadvantage, beyond cost per MWh, is that these sources are not capable of providing a consistent base load. The power generation capabilities of wind, solar, and tidal fluctuate heavily depending on obvious environmental factors. That is not to say they should not form part of our overall power grid.

true,chromofoam,uk,Hertfordshire,"I think it's easy to generalise who the buyers are, but the video simplifies the market quite considerably - for a start, London is MASSIVE, and one agent can only handle a certain patch without losing efficacy on their scope of knowledge of prices and the local area. The data that can be gathered is quite shrouded due to the privacy inherent in the system - you only really get to see publicly what has happened long after the solicitors have completed the deal and the data is placed on the Land Registry - Agents are NOTORIOUS for telling everyone that there are 50 other bidders and the purchaser paid Â£40k over the asking price etc etc and so on - Foxtons are one such agent who will just blatantly lie, and the aim is to win more instructions by manipulating the greed of property owners and cajoling them into selling up and giving the instruction to this agent who is doing so well.
  
I must point out that not every negotiator and not every agency is staffed by utter immoral turds, but often they don't have a choice as they're working on commission and trying to make ends meet in the big smoke.
  
The simplest way of stopping this utter nonsense is to adopt the Scottish system of legally tying the purchaser in if they make a bid, and that will cut the number of idiotic speculative bids almost in half, because people will think a little more carefully before throwing silly figures down and fighting over things that really aren't worth the money being asked.  
  
YES, in some parts of London there ARE 50 buyers per property, and yes there ARE foreign investors, many of them, but the issue and the day-to-day activities of the market are far far more complex than that, and tie in to a great deal many other things such as infastructure, travel cost, jobs, amenities nearby, crime stats....and then on top of that you've got the deals that fall through even after an offer is agreed - survey comes back with a downvaluation, or undisclosed damage, subsidence, outstanding finance or another gremlin, maybe the wiring or the plumbing is knackered, damp in the basement - maybe the vendors upper chain pulls out and they can't move, maybe their lender pulls the plug, perhaps their solicitor pops his clogs three days before exchange and the file gets 'lost' and then they can't find a new one and the whole chain falls to bits because they miss the deadline (you laugh, but stranger things have happened, believe me).
  
Anyway, it's not all bad - some of us agents are nice, and we operate in areas where it's a great deal easier to buy a house. For example I'm trying to sell a Â£348,000 4 bed house in Letchworth, but nobody seems to want to live 30 mins out of London in a leafy quiet commuter town....go figure!",0,1399478848,null,0,false,0,chbwmnu,t3_24rcc9,t1_chbwmnu,t1_cha5uw5,null,1433691441,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Chrisischan,flair8,,"Just because you have a massive pile of wood does not mean you have a functioning structure. Quantity does not equal quality, and if there's a player available that could very well likely improve us, numbers aren't a legitimate reason to entirely withhold interest even with a new manager incoming. The fact of the matter is that our central midfield, any combination of it, has not been dynamic and aggressive enough this season. I think the high back line certainly has a lot to do with that because of the congestion it induces, but we don't have a single complete No 8 player capable enough in defense but also capable of determined play forward to link up attack. We have too many similar players and not enough spark from any of them. 

Realistically (this has nothing to do with my own opinion of the players individually), I think we can expect Livermore to be sold to Hull. It's also very likely that Holtby and Paulinho will be sold. Sandro and Capoue both need to be kept for the CDM role. Dembele's hip problem has slowed him down ever since the beginning of last season, and he won't be getting and much-needed rest on it any time soon. While he still possesses the quality and versatility to be kept preferentially, his situation has become a bit of a problem. Considering all these possibilities, it is not an astronomical stretch to suppose we may bring in a player who can play the No 8 position for us and especially one that would fit right into the Dutch style advocated by FdB.

true,cathalhenry,,Belfast,"&gt; The power generation capabilities of wind, solar, and tidal fluctuate heavily depending on obvious environmental factors. That is not to say they should not form part of our overall power grid.

I agree. I'm not advocating for a 100% renewable grid.

&gt; Our focus should really be on long term research into fusion and high efficiency fuel cells, as well as significantly increased use of nuclear generation.

Again, I agree. Nuclear energy has sadly been the victim of sensationalism.

&gt; The reality of the situation is that fracking is perfectly safe, if done in a controlled and properly regulated fashion. A lot of the horror stories surrounding fracking are coming out of the US, where it is simply not properly regulated.

Unfortunately there has been little to no reassurances that it will be tightly regulated here, or that there won't be an element of self-regulation by Tamboran themselves. It's not just in the US where problems have arisen, but everywhere where fracking has been put into practice. Here's a quick example from [Australia](http://www.lockthegate.org.au/revealed_epa_investigation_report_shows_extent_of_pilliga_contamination) and a simple google search will deliver countless more.

Personally, I'm in favour of a mixed system of gas and renewables. At least until the latter is developed more, until fusion finally comes to fruition, or until we stop the hysteria over fission. In the meantime, we can continue to buy Norwegian gas and hopefully invest in own own green industries.

EDIT: [Regarding costs and regulation: Tamboran, the company in question, are paying NO yearly rental on their licence. Actual regulation appears to be wafer thin, as even the DETI have already admitted they are overworked and unable to carry out some functions that are required of them with respect to Information on the Environment.](http://thegasmancometh.wordpress.com/2014/04/28/sinn-fein-on-fracking-its-the-dup-wearing-green-and-gold/)",0,1399480001,null,0,1399481262,0,chbx6y6,t3_24xxli,t1_chbx6y6,t1_chbwlso,null,1433691707,2,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,2

Brandon hill has no cycle facilities when I went up there and wanted to climb up the tower. Down by broadmead, outside Tesco Metro, there literally aren't enough, you always have to cycle around to find somewhere to lock your bike up to. Asda in bedminster is probably the worst example of a commercial business' bike facilities - they have a cycle capacity in the carpark of about 6 bikes, and they are really low down so it's very hard to fasten your bike to them.

I'm no expert on land prices, but looking at land for sale on rightmove in and around Fakenham, I believe that lands worth would be in the millions. 

* Gerard Batten: I couldn't find much information about his life before UKIP except that he was [former BT saleman](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8368751.stm), for 28 years according to the Wikipedia page.

* John Bufton: Again, I couldn't find much about his past, apart from that he worked for a time in the family haulage business and was the Director of Tourism in Mid Wales. 

* Derek Roland Clark: From his [website](http://www.derekclarkmep.org.uk/about), he spent most of his non-politics career as a science teacher.

* Trevor Colman: Spent most of his career as a police superintendent, but also did some other work, such as a script editor on Wycliffe. 

* William (The Earl of) Dartmouth: From his [website](http://www.williamdartmouth.com/about/about.htm), other than his peerage stuff, he worked as an accountant for 2 years in the UAE, and spent a lot of time working in business and politics. 

* Roger Helmer: From his [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Helmer#Background), most of his career was spent in senior marketing and general management appointments, for companies such as Readers Digest and National Semiconductor, working and running businesses across East and South Asia. 

* Paul Nuttall: Spent time as a history lecturer

* Nigel Farage: He did City trading before his political career.

If I had to put money on it, I would assume that John Stuart Agnew, William Dartmouth, Roger Helmer and Nigel Farage are millionaires, but I just can't be sure. Anyway, it should really matter how much a politicians is worth, or their background, just what they are saying now, and whether they believe it.

&gt; fast reactors can consume or âburn upâ existing nuclear waste, a characteristic that endears them to waste-reduction advocates who see them as a means of âclosingâ the nuclear fuel cycle.

&gt;  like fast reactors, the MSR can be designed to burn up many of the longer-lived byproducts of the fission process, resulting in nuclear waste that is much less radioactive than that produced by the once-through cycle.

But if you do want to bring up Fukushima then lets look at the dangers the UK faces with earthquakes and Tsunamis shall we? I mean that is why the reactor in Fukushima had such a catastrophic failure, [but not the reactor in Onagawa which survived, the tsunami caused by the Earthquake.](http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2012/08/how_tenacity_a_wall_saved_a_ja.html)

&gt;On March 11, 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake rocked the country, merely flooding a basement at the Onagawa plant. The 9-magnitude quake unleashed a 43-foot tsunami that traveled 44 miles from the epicenter to slam into Hirai's seawall. It held.

The strongest [Earthquake in recorded British history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_earthquakes_in_the_British_Isles) was in 1931, 83 years ago with a magnitude of 6.1. The next strongest was 632 years ago in 1382 with a magnitude of around 5.8 (estimated). I like our odds when it comes to Earthquakes, but how about Tsunamis? [Let us have a look](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsunamis_in_the_United_Kingdom), oh my...

&gt;***Tsunamis affecting the British Isles are extremely uncommon, and there have only been two confirmed cases in recorded history.***

I think I favour our odds there too. Frankly, I don't see how anyone can equate the events in Japan with something similar happening in the UK, you'd have to be either stupid or wilfully ignorant.

Looking at the Green Party alliance [website](http://www.greens-efa.eu/) and the things they support, they're against [Biofuels](http://www.greens-efa.eu/don-t-get-bio-fooled-8289.html), they're against [GMO full stop](http://gmo.greens-efa.eu/) and also they're fans of ""alternative"" medicines like [homeopathy](http://cordis.europa.eu/news/rcn/23666_en.html). Frankly, why anyone would support such a coalition/group in the European Parliament is beyond me. But the Green EFA group that is who the Green Party UK is aligned with and frankly I don't see myself being able to support them while they're in bed with a bunch of fucking luddites and nutters.

EDIT: Just to add some more information from [here](http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2014/05/05/if-youre-concerned-about-climate-change-you-should-support-nuclear-power/), [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nuclear_movement_in_Germany#Post_Fukushima) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_phase-out#Germany).

&gt;In Germany, for example, electricity generation from coal has risen to 45 percent last year, the highest level since 2007. Replacing clean electricity from nuclear sources with coal triggered a 25 million ton increase in carbon emissions, the equivalent of adding 4.4 million cars to the road.  Whatâs more, some German utilities are burning lignite coal, which has the highest carbon content of any fossil fuel.  Germany represents an important cautionary tale as we consider the possible consequences of losing our existing nuclear resources.

&gt; Thousands of people in Germany also interrupted the train's journey, forcing it to proceed at a snail's pace, covering 1,200 kilometers (746 miles) in 109 hours. More than 200 people were reported injured in the protests and several arrests were made. Galvanised by the Fukushima nuclear disaster, first anniversary anti-nuclear demonstrations were held in Germany in March 2012. Organisers say more than 50,000 people in six regions took part.

&gt; Critics of a phase-out in Germany argue that the power output from the nuclear power stations will not be adequately compensated and predict an energy crisis. They also argue that only coal-powered plants could compensate for nuclear power and CO2 emissions will increase tremendously (with the use of oil and fossils). Energy may have to be imported from France's nuclear power facilities or Russian natural gas, despite Russia's not being perceived as a safe partner in much of Western Europe.",0,1399480333,null,0,1399482111,0,chbxcvt,t3_24y2j2,t1_chbxcvt,t1_chbvdhe,null,1433691785,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

As many others have said prisoners have access to books in the form of libraries and the ability to order books via amazon so it is by no means a 'book ban' that is just a phrase coined to inflate and misrepresent the issue like 'bedroom tax.'

The issue seems to be the sending of books via parcels. If this really is such a huge issue, surely a simple and easy compromise would be to allow friends/families on the outside (say once every 2 months or something to avoid swamping the staff and to not diminish the reward system) to request an order (which they pay for and maybe a small charge on top of that) for a permitted book from amazon via the prison service (a system which is already in place). After being used the book can be donated to the prison library. Thus the issue of parcels is removed.

Sido Jombati - Was one of the best right-backs in the league during the 2011/12 season. Has dipped majorly in form over the last two seasons which was summed up by his OG on Saturday. 

Sam Deering - Has failed to score a goal in his 2 seasons here, has a high work-rate but doesn't offer enough end product.

Ed Willliams - Youth player, not seen him play.

Ashley Vincent - Has always looked decent when he's played for us, just hasn't worked here for him which is a shame. 

Transfer listed:

Jason Taylor - Has an attitude problem, doesn't offer enough in midfield for us.

Contracts have been offered to Scott Brown, Steve Elliott, Joe Hanks and Jermaine McGlashan. Would like them all to sign except for Jermaine McGlashan, if he didn't have his pace he would be in the Southern Skill Premier. We need a proper winger like Hackett or Roberts. 

Need to sign players who have fight in them, those who want to play football and haven't got an interest in inflating their ego or wages. Signing those kind of players made one of our best teams with the likes of Pack, Penn, Summerfield, Bennett, Garbutt and Duffy.

I thought about this a lot and came to the conclusion that what I really wanted is not for him to simply have money in a S&amp;S ISA, but to get to grips with personal finance and start thinking long-term rather than spending without thinking.

This is hard to achieve. Some people can take what you perceive to be advice as deeply personal criticism. And talking to someone about personal finance when they're possibly spending thousands of pounds on wedding trinkets is a particularly bad time, in my opinion.

A S&amp;S ISA is the last step, not the first. I'd hate to see my brother crack open the account for a new TV or some clothes. Maybe I'm reading too much into your question and your sister is perfectly sensible with money.

I completely agree with what @barejokez says and his/her suggestion. Once you give her the money, it's out of your hands and she may do things with it that seem ridiculous to you.

Another option is to write a similar letter but rather than give her Â£x up-front, say that you want to put in a monthly amount for the next 5 or 10 years.

The number of archive programmes in this genre is fairly limited, but weâre keen to keep two slots dedicated to sci-fi content on Radio 4 Extra, bringing the best programmes available to our listeners. Additionally we will be broadcasting sci fi programming that is longer than The 7th Dimension 1hr slot at other times in the schedule.

&gt;As part of small changes to the Radio 4 Extra schedule, during weeknights weâll now be featuring programmes such as Great Lives, Act Your Age and A Good Read.

&gt;We're keen to keep 7D but the number of archive programmes available is limited. Also we're hoping to broadcast sci fi programmes that are longer than 1hr slot at other times in the schedule in future.

Unlawful act manslaughter (which I'm guessing was what was the offence) is kind of an awkward one. Someone commits an unlawful act (here punching a person) that leads to death. The [CPS sentencing manual](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/manslaughter_-_unlawful_act/) says ""that sentences for these type of offences cover the widest band of sentences for any type of offence"" - from life to very little.

Had the victim not died later in hospital, the starting point for a single punch would probably be [up to 51 weeks in prison](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/sentencing_manual/assault_occasioning_actual_bodily_harm/) - with possible reductions for guilty pleas.

Bad things happen, but criminal justice is about punishing individuals for their actions, not necessarily for the consequences of their actions (that's where the civil law comes in, perhaps). I'm not sure whether it would necessarily be just for a person to spend more than 4 years of their life under a prison sentence for a single punch.

Without the benefit of a written judgment I can't be sure, but I imagine the CoA looked at the facts and the sentence, and concluded that 4 years was within the reasonable bounds of a sentence for unlawful act manslaughter and deferred to the trial court.

**Referendum Promises**:

""Today, I will give this cast-iron guarantee: If I become PM a Conservative government will hold a referendum on any EU treaty that emerges from these negotiations."" â David Cameron MP, The Sun, 26th September 2007

""Nothing will do more damage to the pro-European movement than giving room to the suspicion that we have something to hide, that we do not have the ""cojones"" to carry our argument to the people."" â Nick Clegg, the Guardian, 15th October 2003

""The electorate should be asked for their opinion when all our questions have been answered, when all the details are known, when the legislation has been finally tempered and scrutinised."" â Rt Hon. Tony Blair MP, speech to the House of Commons, 20th April 2004

""This constitutional treaty can only come into force once it has been ratified in accordance with the constitutional arrangements of each member state. In the UK, this will require primary legislation amending the European Communities Act 1972 and then endorsement in a referendum."" â Rt Hon. Jack Straw MP, Foreign Secretary, speech to the House of Commons, 26th January 2005

""The Government have made it clear that the constitutional treaty will be ratified in the UK only after a referendum."" â Geoff Hoon MP, Europe Minister, speech to the House of Commons, 23rd May 2006

""The Government have consistently made it clear that the mechanism in the United Kingdom whereby the European draft constitutional treaty could be implemented is approval by the House of Commons followed by a referendum of the people of Britain. There is no question of implementing it by the back door."" â Douglas Alexander, Europe Minister, speech to the House of Commons, 31st January 2006

""The EU's constitution is so new and large a document that it would be right to hold a referendum on it. "" â Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Danish Prime Minister, EU Observer, 31st May 2003

""I am logically in favour of a referendum. It would be the only legitimate way. "" â Jacques Chirac, French President, speaking about the EU Constitution at the EU Thessaloniki Summit, 21st-22nd June 2003

""The referendum should go ahead in any event. Of course it should."" â Rt Hon. Tony Blair MP, Prime Minister, speech to the House of Commons, 20th April 2004

""It is absolutely clear that there should be a referendum on the European constitutional treaty, and that remains the Government's position."" â Geoff Hoon MP, Europe Minister, speech to the House of Commons, 16th January 2007

""We will put it to the British people in a referendum."" â Gordon Brown, General Election Manifesto, 2005

""... ratification must be subject to a referendum of the British people."" â Liberal Democrat Party, General Election Manifesto, 2005

true,Paludosa2,null,null,"&gt;But your conclusion is based on what evidence?

Well I'm being somewhat disingenuous. It seems very possible that UK **if** it had managed to negotiate a similar position as Switzerland, given it's own clout in international relations it might easily already have achieved superior trade deals. The curve-ball being that this actually might have galvanized any subsequent trade deals the EU could then have worked on after seeing the Brits pave the way. All complete conjecture, but the reason I was dampening down that consideration was to simplify where I actually wanted to be clear on the point I intended to make:-

Both EU-sceptics and Pro-EU can come out with the reports until kingdom come disputing the other...

&gt;I'm not asking for them - this isn't the place for it, but] Do you have evidence to support that position, or is it a hunch based on anecdotes?

I believe Mannsfield arrives at this conclusion in his Brexit paper. Yet this is only in the short-term and again I left that out deliberately as above. In the long-term there appear to be very good reasons for leaving the EU economically.

However, all that is just come back to what I said above:

&gt;*But the emphasis I believe should be on those last 3 points MORE.*

IE: The referendum question on Brexit should prioritize the democratic and sovereign and legal (see Telegraph: ""Britain should leave the EU if Europe's judges trample on our basic protections"") applications of the EU as it is now and the EU as it's future will compared to the UK as it could be in the EEA and again as it could be post-EEA in that future likewise.

true,DHChemist,null,null,"Lack of scientific funding into energy research is definitely an issue, but our current energy policy can't be based upon the idea that ""we'll come up with something awesome soon enough"". [A current generation fission power plant apparently takes 9 years to build](http://www.nei.org/Issues-Policy/New-Nuclear-Energy-Facilities/Building-New-Nuclear-Facilities). As far as I can see from [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_the_United_Kingdom#Future_power_stations), 4 nuclear power stations are currently in the pipeline, but the projects are very much in their infancy so I doubt we'll see any operational before 2024. By then, 8 of our 9 fission plants will have reached it's ""accounting closure date"" (date to be decommissioned), leaving just Sizewell B. 

Now whilst there's a reasonable chance the lifetime of those nuclear power stations can be extended, we've still only got plans at the moment to replace half of them, so the rest of that energy (~10% of Britain's electricity) needs to come from somewhere! Whilst it's only personal opinion, I don't think we can make that deficit up using current wind, solar or hydroelectric methods of generating electricity, so if we want to move away from fossil fuels, I can't think of a proven technology that could supply the energy needed to fill that gap (other than more nuclear power). I also don't believe 9 years is a long enough time period to go from a working prototype to large scale commercial use of an alternative way of generating electricity.

Long term, I think a mix of current renewables and nuclear fusion are the way fowards, but I can't see us being in a position to use those to replace fossil fuels for at least fifty years.

That Telegraph article - ""Britain should leave the EU if Europe's judges trample on our basic protections"" ... oh dear. The CJEU's ruling wasn't remotely complicated. The UK Government had brought a case against a very short Council Decision (saying the 11 countries could look at a financial transaction tax) on the basis of what that FTT might look like. The court ruled that this was stupid, as the court couldn't nullify a perfectly legal act on the basis that someone might pass an illegal one under the pretence of it being authorised by the first. It looks like the UK government simply threw time and money at a pointless case to sure up support from their allies (and it wouldn't be the first time).

And I'm not sure how not striking down a decision that would allow some other countries to impose a FTT counts as ""trampling on our basic protections""... particularly given that the UK already has a FTT.

1. Have an AWESOME personal statement. It's really important, and don't write in it stuff you don't do/haven't done/haven't read, whatever. If you get an interview it's plausible that you will be asked something about your personal statement. (although it depends - for example for Maths my friend didn't have any small talk just doing the exercises on the board/explaining).  
2. Prepare for MAT. Even if you have a mediocre application but a high/v.high MAT score it is more than likely that you will have an interview which is your chance to shine the brightest. However, if you would have a shitty application, shitty PS then even a great MAT score won't probably help you.

Having said that it's a very diverse and friendly city (it's hard to take yourself too seriously with this accent) and it's true that there isn't much in the way of green spaces in the city centre however the city centre's relatively small though and if you travel an hour in any direction from the city centre you'll be in open country and there's plenty of parks in the suburbs so it's actually a very green city overall.

I had a very quick search for electronics engineers jobs and came up with about a hundred, there's probably more in the specialised forums and recruitment pages so you should be alright. 

I'd recommend visiting for the for a week and scoping it out, look at moseley to live or if that's too expensive maybe longbridge, rubery/rednal and you'll be within spitting distance of ther lickey hills and the waseley hills if that's important to you. Look at the city centre nightlife and the real ale pubs and gin bars that are popping up especially around John Bright Street it's a really nice scene.

Existing for 105 years does not mean it is now so justified as to exist forever.  I can't say I know much about it, but I know I'm not upset it doesn't exist anymore.  I can't imagine it was stopped because there is some wild and inexplicable hate of it.

You say that as if the crippling traffic on a hot summer day in a popular seaside town a city with 200 year old infrastructure - is actually their fault.  Which buildings would you knock down to make bigger roads?

I live in Brighton too, and I know that I'm regularly reminded that I am absolutely chuffed that this is not a Labour, Conservative, Lib Dem borough.  
No, it has not been perfect (bins), but it hasn't exactly been awful has it?  And I know for a fact there were bins piling up in London, to a much worse degree in the downturn during the 80s (The 80's - that's 30 years ago.  Bins piling up is not somethign that only happens to failed states.  It happened in London... 30 years ago).  We live in weird economic times and they are comparatively very young party.  They have taken on one of the weirder, more libertarian and socially active boroughs, and done a perfectly good job as far as I can see.

Weaker currency gives a country an advantage in exporting (creating wealth for a country), while a strong currency makes it easier to import. The result is that economies do better with weaker currencies, while the people enjoy cheaper imports with a strong currency.

It is no doubt due to a weak pound that Britain is now forecast to be one of the best performing of the world's largest economies. Unfortunately it's also a weak pound that's making everything in shops so damn expensive at the moment.

However, de-valuing the British currency this way is only possible because we're not part of the eurozone.

*Snodgrass* - Almost certainly off to Celtic. Even if that falls through, he'll go to the prem.

*Ruddy* - Deserves to play higher up than the Championship.

*Fer* - Dutch international. No way he'll want to play in the Championship.

*Bassong* - While he's been poor this season, I'd expect a Prem team to come in for him.

*Olsson* - In my opinion our best player this year. I'd love it if we could keep him, but can't see it unfortunately.

*Hooper* - Be it back to Scotland or a lower Prem team, I suspect someone will want him.

**Possibles**

*Redmond* - A bright talent, although he's fallen away towards the end of this season. Would be nice if we could keep him in the Championship, but I'm not hopeful. Everton maybe?

*van Wolfswinkel* - While his stock isn't very high at the moment, he won't want to play at this level. I could see a Dutch club coming in for him. Hopefully we could get back what we paid for him.

*Howson* - I believe that he is our best player, and I would love for him to stay with us. If I'm being honest, he deserves to play in the Prem. Will other clubs realise how good he is though?

*Hoolahan* - Wanted to go in January, and will probably again in Summer. He'd be good in the Championship. Depends if anybody wants him. Villa could get him if Lambert stays.

*Turner* - Our best CB. I'd love to keep hold of him, but he'd be good for a newly promoted side, or anyone in the bottom half of the Prem for that matter.

true,thetasigma4,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"The best places are season 1, season 7, season 12, season 27, and season 31.

Season 1 is the beginning of 50 years of Doctor Who and is the introduction of everything and has a story arc which creates the Doctor we know today. It is however old sci-fi so is slowly paced and has wobbly sets, black and white etc. and is plagued with missing episodes (97 as of now).

Season 7 marks the moving into colour and a new format with the Doctor trapped on earth. It is an incredibly strong season and it is one of the few with a fairly consistent setting and character base with the entire UNIT crew. It is also pretty slowly paced but has more action than with the first two doctors.

Season 12 is the introduction of the most popular doctor and is also a very good season. It also has the most popular companion and is better paced and the serials (the stories are all made up of multiple parts and are called serials but for the classic series only) are considerably shorter compared to the previous two starting points (which may or may not be good for you)

Season 27. The first of the New series. It is a logical start point and has the most modern pacing as well as some very strong episodes but a lot of cheese and a few issues finding Doctor Who's place on modern TV

Season 31. The first big change in the New series. Doctor Who has now found its place on modern TV the pacing is even better than in series 1/ season 27. It also has a less human Doctor compared to the New series other two Doctors as well as introducing a three season story arc.

These, I think, are the best starting points in Doctor Who. However these miss out on some great Doctor Who such as the entire Second Doctor (apart from the first option) etc. but as the Classic series had few story arcs you also have the option of jumping around a lot to which i will give you this list of some of the best episodes:

1: His pure historicals are good (IMO) such as The Aztecs, Reign of Terror and the Romans. The First Three serials are also good (including the first Dalek serial. Time meddler I also enjoy. Also the Tenth Planet is good


2: If you don't mind reconstructions Power of the Daleks, Macra Terror, and Evil of the Daleks are Good but if you do the following are also good, Mind Robber, Invasion, War Games, Tomb of the Cybermen, Enemy of the World

3: His entire first series is amazing (IMO) so watch all of that and then maybe Green Death, The Three Doctors, The Seas Devils, Carnival of Monsters and The Time Warrior

4: First series is mostly great especially Arc in Space and Genesis of the Daleks( easily one of the best stories of Doctor Who ever). Then there are Terror of the Zygons, Planet of Evil, Brain of Morbius, Horror of Fang Rock, Terror of Weng-Chiang (unfortunately a bit racist but a good story nonetheless), Sun Makers, Key to Time (Classic Who's first long story arc), City of Death, Logopolis.

5:Kinda, Snakedance, Black Orchid, Earthshock, Cave of Androzani are all good

6:Vengance on Varos and the Trial of a Time Lord (second long story arc Classic who did)

7:Happiness Patrol, Remembrance of the Daleks, Greatest show in the Galaxy an his entire last season are all good

8: Movie unsurprisingly. This is not a great story but Paul McGann is excellent in it

I will add almost everything by Robert Holmes is fantastic. Full list of episodes and synopses (for the classic series) here for you to have a look and decide which serials you find interesting: http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/index_first.shtml

You can also do this for the new series but the new series is much more arc-driven and so you would probably miss out on some important episodes in the series' arcs but for sake of balance here is a similar list
 
9: Dalek, Father's Day, and The Empty Child/ Doctor Dances are all good

10: Human nature/Family of Blood, Midnight, Girl in the Fireplace, Blink, Waters of Mars, Forest of the Dead/Silence in the Library

11: Eleventh Hour, Vincent and the Doctor, Amy's choice, The Pandorica Opens/The Big Bang, God Complex, the Girl who waited, Cold War, and the Crimson Horror.

true,hiakuryu,cnty-england,London,"I'd say their complete dismissal of science and other technical advances leads me to think they're talking utter bollocks when it comes to the Economy or other issues too... 

Let us take a look now... 

&gt;EC202 To achieve an equitable distribution of resources, wealth, opportunity and power which ensures access for all to the means of sustenance and of personal and social development.

What the hell does that even mean?

&gt;EC401 The objective of EC402 is to shift the balance of economic power in favour of individuals and households, and away from large scale, remote private companies and central government. It will make full-time paid employment less necessary, and will encourage home-based and part-time employment, and work in the 'third sector'. People will be able to choose their own working lifestyles. The objective of EC403 is to enable people to meet their needs at the level most personal to them (the household sector being the smallest unit in any community) and to contribute more effectively through the informal economy to the wider community. A strong household sector, both informal and formal, will be resilient to fluctuations in the wider economy.

Oh... That's what it means. I'm sure business will just love that.

How about defence?

&gt;PD301 We would promote town twinning, exchange visits, pen friend schemes and Internet-based methods for learning about other countries and cultures by direct contact. One of the main purposes of embassies would be to learn about culture and current affairs of their host countries by immersion in a wide variety of local activities. The UN should provide significant support for building effective law and order systems that are not affected by corruption, and for support of free and democratic elections.

&gt;PD302 On inspection, there is little or no threat of direct invasion of the UK by any nation. Commitment to a large standing army, a navy of large warships around our coastline, squadrons of fighter planes and a cripplingly expensive missile defence system is therefore unnecessary. Any threat of invasion that might arise in the future is so remote that realignment of the UK military and defence preparations would be possible long before any invasion occurred.

So what they're saying is, we can completely disband the military and train up as and when as needed... I call that the UN Resolution method of foreign policy. ""Stop doing it! I'm serious! I'm telling you to stop doing it! Otherwise I'll... err... um... Tell you to stop doing it some more!""
