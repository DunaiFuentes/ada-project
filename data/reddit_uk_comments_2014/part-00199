true,MalcontentUK,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"Hey, I have total sympathy for the position you're in and understand that it is probably very frustrating and difficult.

First of all bare a few things in mind; you're young (23 is very young!), you have a degree and you speak a foreign language. These are all things in your favour. I know you don't want to do Law, but your degree still opens up a lot of other career paths. You have many things in your favour. Many people do a degree at university and then don't actually use the degree in their work. So when thinking about what things you would like to do long term bare that in mind.

Secondly; this may be difficult to accept but you may need to move if you want to have a decent job. I'm from Manchester and I love the place but sadly the opportunities up north are very poor compared to the south, and in particular London. Don't limit your options to what the local job centre can offer you; if you want a career or a more satisfying job than they have on offer then you need to start applying to companies you're interested in and entry level positions that you think will lead on to something you want. And not just London, but Europe; you have a right to work in the EU and depending on what your foreign language is, being a native English speaker is an added bonus. It can be hard work moving to a new place, and life in London is tough but it can also be a great opportunity and even a springboard for returning home in a few years with greater work experience and greater employability locally if thats what you want long term. 

Alternatively consider taking some time to travel and see something of the world. It is very easy to get sucked into this belief that the world ends at your street or where you're living now. The reality is there are lots of places you can go and things you can do with your life, including many things that are off the beaten track. 

Don't fall in to the trap of believing that the way you feel now is the way you will always feel or that because things seem grim now, they can only ever be bad. You are in charge of your life, and if you're unhappy then you need to make the changes. Life is not easy, but sometimes when it gets hard it is time to take some risks, or make imaginative and bold choices. There is a whole world out there, with loads of opportunities and options out there to grab; but they won't come looking for you, you have to go looking for them. If you don't like what is on offer to you at the moment, then I think it is time to cast the net wider and look further afield.",0,1405213694,null,0,1405213890,0,civusbq,t3_2ai7s7,t1_civusbq,t3_2ai7s7,null,1434687789,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;And Adams is a southern representative.

Yes. You said that before. And I explicitly included him in the pages of politicians in the Republic of Ireland that they took the piss out of. You no doubt approve of the website taking the piss out of him and that one single solitary Shinner in the Dail gets at least three times the piss taken out of him as all of Northern Irish unionism. Given your previous statement about finding material in the Republic, I'll take this particular reiteration of Gerry Adam's current electoral status as a somewhat inarticulate and confused, but nonetheless ringing, endorsement of this website's choice of material.

&gt;There was another snipe at loyalists posted a day ago, and it's definitely not the first

To be fair, I was scanning for a survey of the politicians they were taking the piss out of, and that article wasn't in the Politics section, since it doesn't mention politicians. Besides, if you'd read beyond the first paragraph or two, you'd see it sniping at the part-time sectarianism of nationalist teenagers as well as loyalist ones, so it's more of a commentary on the whole dismal and toxic political culture of Northern Ireland.

Now perhaps the choice of articles that shows up in r/northernireland shows that there are more nationalists reading reddit than unionists. It's quite possible. Though, from my reading, it looks like, if anything, r/ni is populated by a plurality of people from either side, who're sick of all that sectarian shite and that a handful of insecure unionist types tend to misread a lot of non-nationalist criticism of the behaviour of loyalists and unionist politicians as actual nationalism.

And even if the place is mostly nationalists, none of that matters anyways, because you're not going to magick up a unionist consensus or change people from nationalist to unionist by whingeing about the perceived imbalance of articles here. That's just futile. Instead, you should do the reddit thing and post the articles *you* want to see, and upvote articles you like if someone else posts them. 

This pathetic whinge about the supposed pro-nationalist tone of r/northernireland (like most whinges about the politics of other subreddits) boils down to 'waaah there are more people on here who disagree with me than agree with me'. And that's not the fault of anyone or anything, other than perhaps you, and the people you agree with not being able to persuade people that your ideas and your way of looking at the world is the right one. Reddit is a self-selecting bunch of people who decide to show up when they feel like it and say what they feel like saying. If the people you agree with just aren't showing up, it's really not the fault of the people you disagree with.

Enrique gives me heart attacks, but between him and Flanagan we have options.

Lallana I can see being slotted in from day 1, while Can and Lambert aren't expected to fill starting roles. Markovic may take a few games to even begin the settling process.

It seems that Rodgers thinks we can kick on by adding players familiar with the league. It's also worth remembering that Lovren and Bony have European experience, for what that's worth.

And a quick look at your post history has you down as an Aussie, and given your other posts on City, excuse me for being sceptical on your claim of being a longterm fan.

Besides, I don't think you're less of a fan if this issue isn't as important to you as it is to me - and others.

It made sense however that you wouldn't care about my opinion or the clubs traditions or heritage as a new fan.

You've also resorted to mocking me and any other blues who shares my opinion.

That makes you come across as arsehole mate.

I'm not dismissive of others opinions, when someone expresses a sincere opinion on something they're passionate about and writes about it in depth, why would you seek to mock them?

That is against the purpose of a site like this.

Again, you're just resorting to pathetic insults now, I'm having ""hissy fits"" and I'm an ""unstable"" person am I?

Playground stuff.

I've explained in depth why it irks me, it think it's an example of kit manufacturers undermining our heritage in a manner in which other top European sides don't have to put up with.

read the wiki page on chelsea to get a sense of the history.  search youtube for great games and moments.  and as you watch the games you will hear references to to good and bad moments.  make a not and check them out after the game.

check out Talk Chelsea forum.  lots of good posts there.  and listen to some podcasts.(The Chels, Chelsea Football Fancast, Podding Shed, Chelsea in America)  they are all on break now but maybe listen to the last ones of the season and its fun to go back and listen to the ones before and after big moments like winning the Champions League in 2012.

You have it the wrong way around. The pharmacological treatments are all to do with altering levels of neurotransmitters or their receptors, but the causes are considered to be multifactorial, with the psychological profile, social environment, genetic predisposition, and other influences all playing various roles in the aetiology.

There are also psychotherapeutic approaches such as cognitive behavioural therapy, or other talking therapies. Even so, despite the range of treatments available, some people do not significantly improve, and many relapse later. Depression is still indeed a mystery in many ways, and research into the condition is very active.

&gt; ""Israel’s ‘new battlefield’ is ‘delegitimisation’ and the UK is seen as a key site of contestation. The media is of course a key arena for this battle of narratives and the BBC is clearly of great importance globally, not solely in the UK. The BBC should mediate fairly between the different voices but is not doing very well. While it stops short of inverting reality in the vein of Fox News, there is much material to suggest that the BBC obscures and disguises it in subtle ways that protect Israel from much of the harsh criticism it deserves. And it matters a lot. Pressure from below in the West has been a key missing element in the search for a just peace so far. As Chomsky and others, in an important article entitled ‘Nous accusons’ wrote, “the lack of widespread public outrage at [Israel’s] crimes is a direct consequence of the systematic way in which the facts are withheld and/or of the skewed way these crimes are portrayed.”

&gt; ""The BBC is not the only – or even the worst – case of partial reporting on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but it is one of the most influential. Though the pro-Palestinian lobby has become more organised of late - and is currently pushing for an inquiry in to pro-Israel bias - it is fighting an uphill battle. The BBC is inherently conservative and, more to the point, anxiety about being accused of ‘anti-Israeli’ bias seems to have been firmly instilled in at least the higher echelons of command. As the courageous Israeli journalist Amira Hass put it, Israeli ""propaganda"" scored yet another ""victory"" during the latest attack on Gaza, with Western leaders agreeing that it was “exercising its right to self defence” and the BBC parroted this line almost without question.""",0,1405218333,null,0,1405218514,0,civwlfy,t3_2ajsae,t1_civwlfy,t1_civuunn,null,1434688483,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Section 2a (clause 28) had complicated origins, but had much to do with the way in which the far left hijacked social issues and used public to do so. It also had a lot to do with the way in which gay organisations went beyond promoting the acceptability of homosexuality and demanded the destruction of the 'traditional' family (much like feminists did).

Here is what clause 2a meant in its entirety:

'The amendment stated that a local authority ""shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality"" or ""promote the teaching in any maintained school of the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship"".'

Never been a fan of the clause myself, but I think it wise to put it into perspective.

Unlike, for example, someone from Essex or Toronto saying they're a United fan because they had a grandfather that was from Manchester - and other such entirely laughable and transparent nonsense.

People can support who they want, but it's when they lie about their motives that they invite ridicule.

Drowsiness, insomnia, nausea, weight changes, vivid dreaming, frequent urination, decreased sex drive, anorgasmia, dry mouth, increased sweating, trembling, diarrhea, excessive yawning, and fatigue. Less common side effects include bruxism, vomiting, cardiac arrhythmia, blood pressure changes, dilated pupils, anxiety, mood swings, headache and dizziness. Rare side effects include convulsions, hallucinations, severe allergic reactions and photosensitivity.

true,apeliott,null,null,"Why limit yourself to just two shitty places in one small and shitty country?

There are hundreds of other places out there in the world with thousands of opportunities. Get yourself out of the UK and get some perspective.

I used to be in the same situation as you. I looked around and all I saw was a choice between living the rest of my life in the town where I grew up, surrounded by shitty retail jobs and call centers, or taking a big risk and going to London, and I hate London.

I decided to stay where I was and landed a half-respectable government job sitting behind a desk doing paperwork. It was about as much fun as it sounds, but it was better than working in a supermarket.

About six years later I treated myself to a once-in-a-lifetime holiday to Australia. Something I had wanted to do ever since I was a little kid. 

So I booked a week off work, hopped on a plane and 26 hours later I was landing in Sydney airport. After the first three days I thoiught ""Fuck going back to that desk job, I'm going to live here"". So I flew back to the UK, landed in Heathrow Sunday then walked into work Monday morning.

Boss - ""Hey, welcome back. How was your holiday?""

Me - ""Great thanks. I quit""

Boss - ""What?""

Me - ""I quit. I'm going to go live in Australia""

Boss - ""But, why?""

Me - ""Look around the office""

     *Boss looks around the dull, grey office filling up with bored, grey office workers* 

Me - ""Now look out the window""

     *Boss looks out the window at the cold rain falling out of a grey sky onto a grey car park*

Me - ""That's why""

Boss - ""Yeah, I see now. Do you have a job?""

Me - ""No""

Boss - ""What about a visa?""

Me - ""No""

Boss - ""So what are you going to do?""

Me - ""I'm going to give it a go see how it turns out. My only alternative is to stay in this office until I retire. I can't do that. I can't afford to take that risk and I'm not getting any younger""

Boss - ""Good luck. I wish I could go with you""

And that seeemed to be the attitude of pretty much everyone I told that week. Friends, family. Everyone. I honestly expected people to try and talk me out of it, but they didn't. Not one of them. They all thought it was a great idea. Many of them told me how much they would love to do the same thing but couldn't.

So a week later I packed a single suitcase and went back to Australia. I stayed with a friend and got myself a working holiday visa. Later, I got myself an interesting job in a great location with an amazing boss who offered to sponsor me for a work visa and then help me get a permanent resident visa as he had done for some of his other staff. It was a great life, a dream come true. Everything falling into place.

But a year later I had met a girl from Japan who I wanted to be with. She didn't want to leave her family in Tokyo so I decided to do it all again. Jump ship and leave for another country. The attitude of my boss was awesome (He was Greek, I think that matters)

Me - ""Hey, thans for everything you have done for me. I'm really sorry, but I have to quit""

Greek Boss - ""Quit?! Why? What are you going to do?""

Me - ""I'm really sorry, but I'm going to Japan"" 

Greek Boss *Looking really concerned*- ""Japan?? Why the fuck do you want to go there?? You said you wanted to live in Australia, are you crazy?!""

Me - ""I...uh, I met a girl...""

Greek Boss - ""You met a girl?! Do you love her?""

Me - ""Um...I kinda...yeah, I think so...""

Greek Boss *attitude changes, big smile on his face* - ""Then that's different! Why didn't you say it was for love?! GO! You must go to her! Follow your heart! Never turn away from love my friend!"" 

So I did it. 

Three days later and I'm arriving in Tokyo airport. No job, no visa, no clear plan. Just a hope and a dream. I remember thinking I must be twice as crazy to do this a second time. I must have been lucky the first time, but twice? In twelve months? No chance. But Greek Boss had a good point. I had to give it a go.

Anyway, to cut a long story a little shorter, this was about eight years ago. And now? I'm still in Tokyo. I married that girl and we have two kids together. I eventually got a permanent residency, bought a nice little apartment (In my name) and I have a great job with great salary, really nice hours (I'm only working 27 hours a week for July/August) and really interesting surroundings.

Sure, sometimes I look out the window and it's grey and raining. But fuck it, it's grey and raining and I'm in fucking Tokyo.

Being ill is not a lifestyle choice. This sort of thing just reinforces the notion that it is. And what happens when this sort of treatment is ineffective? Will people be sanctioned for not getting well?

How are people going to be made to feel better about unemployment? They can be pressured into taking drugs which (often harmfully) alter their brain chemistry, or to undergo CBT which, though great for helping people with many issues, is not going to make an iota of difference about how you feel about being unemployed. So, what's going to happen when depressed people pull out of sessions which they feel don't make much difference?  They'll be sanctioned for ""refusing treatment"".

This is completely fucking diabolical. When you fall ill with stress and despair, you're going to be thrown back into the grinder or the safety net is going to be cut from right under your feet. No, what depressed people need is stability and understanding more than anything.

true,lithaborn,eng-westmidlands,West Midlands,"I'm diabetic. One of the knock-on effects of diabetes is something called peripheral neuropathy. Basically, you experience excruciating pain in your extremities.

I've had this quite mildly and it's not something you want to live with. For a few months, I wasn't able to lift a mug, turn a door handle, hod a pen, operate a keyboard without the prospect of screaming, eye-fuzzing, lingering agony.

The quick fix? Antidepressants. Low dosage, but antidepressants nonetheless. I was *strongly* encouraged by my GP to begin taking them, to the point of them pointedly confused and quietly critical of me refusing (I *will not* take them, no matter what. An SSRI will *never* pass my lips).

You don't really recover from peripheral neuropathy, it's permanent nerve damage. What you can do to make the pain go away is get better control of your condition, which I did and I am now mostly pain-free, although my fingertips are numb and delicate work is nigh impossible.

I'm on ESA. As antidepressants are a viable treatment for my condition and I *might* be better able to find employment if I were taking them, will my benefits also be dependent on me taking a drug I have moral and practical objections to, even though there is a treatment which is better for me in the long run?

true,ta_rondo,null,null,"Welcome, OhGodRedditWhy.  What exceptional taste in football clubs you have!

Watch for our 'old guard' that have been exceptional servants for the last decade.  We just lost Drogba, Super Frank (Lampard), Cole and The Bison (Essien), but we still have our rock-sold captain and legend John Terry, the unparalleled Petr Cech and Mikel Obi plus Ivanovic are headed toward club legend status.

Also, watch for the incredible fountain of talent we have recently picked up in the form of Hazard, Salah, Willian, Matic, Schurrle, Oscar, Ramires, Fabregas, Costa and Courtois.  With a little bit of luck, everything will work out with Lukaku, and we'll have quite the strike force this upcoming season, which is the only thing we've truly been missing recently.

We've had a rough patch with managers ever since Mourinho and Chelsea initially parted company, with Grant serving for less than one season, followed by a poor season under Scolari, an excellent recovery under Hiddink &lt;- (we totally love this guy), an excellent run under Ancelotti &lt;- (we also love this guy) for a couple years, a poor season start under Villas Boas, then an exceptional recovery under Di Matteo &lt;- (we totally love this guy too), then a shocking and painful replacement in the form of a Spanish waiter.  Then, when things were at their darkest, Mourinho (blessed be his name) came back to us.  We're optimistic about the next season and have well earned faith in The Special One's ability to lead us to victory.

Historically at Chelsea, Mourinho has a reputation for playing brute-force defensive, counter-attacking football.  It seems to be the case that Mourinho has been tasked with playing a more attractive and attacking style football, and with all of the new additions, this may be possible. 

Lastly, I think Chelsea suffers from the new-money image it picked up during Abramovich's early reign where Chelsea seemingly bought their way into the top of the table.  Most people feel that the top spots are the birthright of United, Arsenal and Liverpool.  Eventually that will change, but many still see us as pretenders to the throne.  This is a view that is getting harder and harder to defend as we have become part of the top-four furniture, have a packed trophy cabinet and are on the path to financial fair play compliance.  The future is bright and I'm glad you're along for the ride.  Welcome!

Last year a large part of our success was down to team chemistry and everyone being on the same page. Trying to assemble an all star team could easily put an end to that. 

I like that Lallana and Lambert already know how to play with half the team due to the England squad. I also like that they've gone through promotions with Southampton. They might not have won the biggest trophies, but they know what a high stakes season is like. Plus they've seen formations and tactics in the lower leagues that might not have made it to the prem. That might come in handy for the domestic cups and Europe.

I like that players like Can and Makovic will come in with very little pressure, but can be a big part of the team right from the beginning of they adjust quickly.

I wish people would stop saying our club is above signing certain players. Anyone who wants to help LFC win is welcome. I know big names make the world go round, but it's also possible that your biggest hero by the end of the season could be a kid you haven't even heard of yet.

Lambert is a great signing for cover.

Lallana has to be the most underrated player in the league currently. Sorry he isn't lallaninho, maybe that will help you rate him. Some serious grass is greener in the foreign league shit is going on here.

Emre Can is a potentially world class DM and would be a great understudy to Gerrard.

Markovic. Just ask benefica fans about him. He is a pheonomially talented player.

Origi played ahead of Lukkaku for Belgian team. Also being loaned back to his parent club. One for the future.

All of these signings look good. Obviously they are not Sanchez but the all (bar one) have potential to be better or on an comparable level.

I told him the heart, the passion, etc., and he said that that still didn't give us any history. It turned out he was a Liverpool supporter, so I kinda returned the banter as he was getting a bit aggressive, with me calling out that Liverpool had spent 24 years without a trophy. My other coworker, who wasn't familiar with the sport, was just asking questions until eventually, the Liverpool fan put his foot down and from his tone got serious. Fortunately, after a couple of days, we got on speaking terms and we get along very well.  

Anyway, one thing you will notice is the constant ""raids"" Arse and Liverpool supporters do on our sub, which account for any downvotes here. You will realize that they spout out some farcical arguments for why they are superior to Chelsea because of ""muh attacking football"" and ""muh history"". They will always deny that they see Chelsea as their main rivals, more so than United for Liverpool and Spuds for Arse, but every - damn - time that you mention Chelsea, Mou, Roman, Chelsea victory and anything that has to do with us, you can feel thousands of anuses clench in butthurt and anger.

true,hexanaticious,wardr,Hurt,"Rose - It's the setup, but friends I try to get interested in the show find themselves bored before finishing this episode. Might be worth watching the next two episodes then coming back to this one.

The end of the world - Gives a silly, but good idea of the series aliens. Some alright action, more or less a better idea of what the series has to offer. Reading the summary of the Rose episode can fill in the blanks if you're confused.

The Unquiet Dead - Shows how the show plays around with history. Not great action, but still a good episode for the drama.

Aliens of London &amp; World War Three - There are good parts, and a lot of bad parts to this episode pair. Keep your hand on the fast forward button if the jokes are too infantile. You could get away with skipping this two parter, but it would come back later in the season for a more series plot important episode.

Dalek - The doctor's oldest enemy, bad moral dilemmas, the doctor's darkness and history, etc. 

The Long Game - Filler episode with a bit of series plot, not bad, has some Simon Pegg if that appeals to you. 

Father's Day - Drama episode, mostly filler for this series. Shouldn't be painful to watch.

The Empty Child &amp; The Doctor Dances - This is the episode pair I first watched. First time watching when it aired gave me shivers. It's sort-of a 'horror' episode of the series.

Boom Town - This episode almost requires you have avoided skipping the Aliens of London two parter. Lots of bad parts, series important plot bits scattered within though. 

""Bad Wolf"" &amp; ""The Parting of the Ways"" - Given this is the series finale, I don't think I need to justify why you should watch.

If you make it this far, then you'll probably go onto season 2.

They're a sticking plaster, lazy solution to a problem which is too costly in time and manpower to fix easily, so instead of *helping* patients who desperately need a permanent fix, GP's medicate them into meek compliance. It's easier for them to treat the side effects of antidepressants than it is to get them the long term psychoanalytical help they need to get better.

To me, that attitude is morally questionable at best. I expect the vast majority will disagree. Honestly, I'm used to people disagreeing with me, so it doesn't bother me one bit.

This may get lost but I hope you read at least a little of it. 

I have had some very dark days since graduating (whilst getting meningitis at the same time). 

I am 25 now and have done loads if weird jobs.

My advice to you would be this: 

- be confident as hell. When applying for a job, the only thing you are doing is talking about yourself and trying to improve your situation. The second you realise that, interviews, whatever format they take will be so easy. 

- don't be too proud to try something. If you are at a loose end, do a labouring job. It doesn't tax the mind too much which leaves mental capacity to apply for jobs in the evening. You make awesome friends and it sets you apart when amongst other people wanting the same job you do. 

- always work as hard as fuck! You may think this is a no-brainer but seriously, do this. My current job, on 30k, with car, bupa health care, amazing work mates, clear wage and professional progression etc was offered to me on a plate, with free job specific education (second degree part time) for no other reason than they loved how hard I worked as a labourer. They knew I had a degree which they simply acknowledged as the requisite smarts for the job, the rest was simply down to working hard. 

Keep your chin up, be confident, work hard; you never know where you might end up!

I prefer relying on larger studies rather than anecdata -- here's a [metastudy of clinical trials](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11206593), which concludes that Citalopram is more effective than a placebo for treating depression and is safe in doses of 20 - 60mg per day.

Obviously it's harmful in some cases. Side effects can be nasty. In which case you can go to the doc and get checked out, and try a lower dose/change meds/stop and try something else/persist and hope the effects reduce over time, etc. You don't just suffer with debilitating consequences.

That list is POTENTIAL side effects and you would be very, very, very unlucky to get more than a few. Besides, I was so depressed I could hardly get out of bed. For me, it was worth nausea and visual disturbances to feel better again.

true,coombeseh,null,null,"Ok, as someone who is about to qualify as a commercial pilot (at a school called FTE Jerez in Spain, alongside BA FPP cadets) and will be returning to the UK to look for a job in a couple of months, I can try to answer this.

1) The training is expensive - it's going to put you in about £90,000 worth of debt, but depending on where you train that should be it. No extra costs for meals or rent, just a 14-18 month course for that price. Given that you are doing a 5 year degree (I presume in the UK) and are about to go into second year (so I presume £9,000 tuition fees), that's one hell of a lot of debt in what is always going to be an incredibly uncertain career.

2) It's tough. At least where I'm training, you will be looking at 6 day weeks for 9 of the 14 months of the course, lectures are 6 hours a day for the first 8 months, and flying can be anything up to 8 hours in a day. You then have all your own study time on top of this.

However, with all that said, if you really really really want to become a pilot and you think you can afford it, go for it. The things you have heard about poor pay are mostly just from the US (where the hours requirement to become an airline pilot are much higher and starting salaries are as low as $20,000) - in Europe, there is much less restriction on what you need to start an airline job and there are airlines hiring in the UK right now.

Career progression is good too, with low-cost (but by no means low-salary) airlines like Ryanair you will get the required hours to become a Captain within 2-3 years and you will then be able to move on to long-haul if that's what you want to do.

I cannot tell you much about the job itself as I have no experience of it (hopefully that will change very soon), but I can tell you that working for an airline is certainly not the only option once you have the qualification. One of my close friends just recently started working for Specsavers (yes, the opticians) flying their management around the UK in brand new private aircraft.

The world of aviation is a varied one, and if you really want to join it then do. Though tough, the training itself is really good fun, and there are jobs to be had out there!

And that's exactly the effect it had. It effectively shut down discussion of homosexuality in schools and meant kids were unable to ask questions on the subject to teachers wound up in Section 28's vague red tape. It meant support groups for gay youths closed out of fear. 

It wasn't Thatcher's legislation alone, there were other people more instrumental in its creation, but she was clear that young men and women had no right to identify as homosexual, and that to imply otherwise was somehow immoral. If that's 'promoting' homosexuality, I'd say most normal thinking people promote homosexuality.

&gt;&gt;You didn't win that 5-1 game; we lost it. And as facts go we won our *last* meeting, so status quo dictates we are the better team. Boo!


&gt;Bullshit, we finished second. You got only fourth. Second is better than fourth any day. Yay!

&gt;&gt;But you are inconsistent. You finished no higher than sixth for the previous four seasons while we always managed at least fourth. Boo!

&gt;Well at least we finished ahead of you. That should mean we are the better team. Yay!

&gt;&gt;But you did not win any trophies; we won the FA cup. Boo!

&gt;Well ffs you equalized off a wrongly-awarded corner in that cup final. And were then held into extra time. By HULL CITY. Definitely deserving cup winners. Yay! /s

&gt;&gt;But a trophy is a trophy. We got one last season. You got zero. Boo!

&gt;*Still*, at least we've won the CL, the holiest of all club trophies, in the past. Five times, in fact. You won zero. Yay!

&gt;&gt;History faggots. Well good luck even qualifying for CL next season, with your best player gone and us getting Alexis Sanchez. Boo!

&gt;Well our Suarez money will go into balancing the team, rather than signing another star striker. Balanced beats unbalanced. And we still have Sturridge as the league's best striker going into this season. Yay!

&gt;&gt;But Sanchez is the shit and will crush him come this season's end. And we are also landing Khedira while you are landing a bunch of unknowns. Boo!

&gt;Individual stars don't amount to much. We won more points without Suarez playing than with him. It's the team and the manager than counts. Yay!

&gt;&gt;""I'm so excited to be playing alongside Sturridge and Henderson, rather than Alexis Sanchez and Sami Khedira,"" said no one ever. Boo!

&gt;We have a passionate manager, a proven attacking philosophy, a glorious history, and the best fans in the world. That is enough to attract the best players. Yay!

&gt;&gt;We have motherfucking London, bitch. London &gt; Manager, philosophy, history and fans combined. Re: Sanchez. Boo!

&gt;That's only cos Sanchez didn't see the 5-1 highlights. Yay!

&gt;&gt;Or maybe because he thinks — rightly so — that we are historically the better team. Boo!

Congrats that Ramsey got world-class in 4 months. I'd kindly ask you to show me how he was even one of the best mids in the league before that, especially since his period of world-class play came with him adding goals to his game, a side he hadn't shown at all until last year.

What is hilarious is that without Suarez we have.... wait, the best striker in the league who has been a proven goalscorer when he's been played consistently at ST.

Honestly, I don't begrudge you for thinking very highly of Ramsey and Wilshere. I really don't. But admit that it's a bias based on watching them play constantly and not based on their actual production. Walcott is a good player, though, and I think he's the most bankable of the three in terms of what he'll add to the side. But he seems a bit fragile, though admittedly not as much as the other two.

This whole things reeks of players who only a certain club's supporters rate. United has Carrick, and we have Henderson, but Arsenal seems to have a fuck load of players who don't really produce consistently, yet you lot think they're world class. I remember reading on /r/gunners about how gifted Gibbs and Jenkinson are and how they have potential to be world-class. lol.

true,wessexboyofsidney,SidneySussex,Sidney Sussex,"I will answer those which I feel I can shed some light on...

*DISCLAIMER* I do history, what I write here is definitely true for my subject, but may be less true for others...

2) The grading system is listed as follows.

 * Fail - less than 40/100
 * 3rd: - 40-49/100: considered very poor
 * 2:ii -  50-59/100: considered to be not great, you spend most of your time trying to make sure your work doesn't drop into 2:ii territory (or at least that's my philosophy)
 * 2:i - 60-69/100: Ideal. This is exactly what you want, and what employers want to see. (e.g. there has even been an - admittedly very controversial - article in which the columnist claimed he would shy away from employing those with firsts from Cambridge as they would be socially inept. This is an extreme case, but believe me when I say a 2:i is good to put on your CV)
 * 1st - 70+/100: Exceptional. In many subjects, those who aim and fight to get a first want to continue in academia or follow a career path which follows directly from their degree.

In History, there is no curve, exam essays are double marked - by two independent fellows - and each award a score /100, after which a mean of the two scores is taken, and that's your mark for that essay. Absolutely, everyone in an entire year of Historians could get a first.
However different subjects have very different ways of marking. So some subjects definitely will have a curve, in which not everyone in a given year could get a first. Another important difference in marking is caused by inherent differences between subjects. Given that in some subjects you can often have an absolute right or wrong answer (Natural Sciences for example), and in others that is just not the case (History), this means that subjectivity in marking has a much bigger part to play in some subjects (History), and makes particularly extreme marks on the spectrum very rare - a 100/100 score in a Natural Science exam essentially means you have given the correct answer to every question (I think, like I say I'm not a NatSci), but in History a 100/100 score would represent the best essay that could possibly be written on that given question. Professors and fellows at the university couldn't really write a 100/100 essay, it's more like an ideal than an attainable thing. The highest score my Director of Studies has ever seen a student get is 85, and that was very controversial.


3) House parties do exist in the UK, though are probably less common in Cambridge as many people leave in College. That said, parties still occur (and are even somewhat encouraged) in college, and drinking games of various sorts are common. Usually the cheapest bar you will have access to is your own college bar (though having seen your flair, John's is pretty bloody expensive), so that's often a lively and pleasant place to go for a drink. My college's bar is all student run, so not only do you know everyone behind the bar, the bar itself is not run for profit but for the benefit of students, making it probably 55% the price of a normal pub in town.
Otherwise, there are plenty of social events to which you will find yourself invited, both alcoholic and not. Swaps are common in Cambridge, in which either sports teams or drinking societies from different colleges (and almost always of opposite sexes) meet for a very boozy dinner before going clubbing. These can get extremely out of hand and quite scary, or can just be good fun, depends who you're with. Otherwise, there are plenty of clubs and college run club nights around Cambridge you can go to (check out Clare Ents, a club night held in the cellars under Clare college Chapel, often with great live music). College bars will often also hold 'bops' a couple of times a term, an event which falls somewhere between club night and house party I guess, often in fancy dress, and often good fun.


4) I'm sure some people do it, but I was way too busy, as were all of my friends. It's one hour on the train though, so not a great hassle, and if you can be sufficiently organised with your work to give you time to go on trips to London, it should be doable. In fairness, I play music with a friend who's at uni in London, which meant I actually did go down to London for gigs once or twice a term, but that was a really rushed thing; I would get the train at 5 or 6pm from Cambridge, get to London 7pm, play the gig at 8 or 9 and be on the 11.30pm train back to Cambridge, spending a whole day in London would take an awful lot of work time out of my week.


5) Hall was originally always served like at a restaurant; multiple courses with a waiting staff. That has changed now and all colleges have a cafeteria style hall; you line up with your tray, get what you want, go and eat it. However, the old style remains in the form of 'formal hall'. Different colleges do it differently, but often there will be a formal hall several times a week (mine does three a week), for which you will sign up a few days in advance with your friends, get dressed up fairly smart, put your gown on, and get served a three course meal. Quality of the food is (depending on your college, usually) better than standard hall, there's a Latin grace read before and after your meal by the most senior member of college present, it's all very Cambridge and very good fun. With the exception of a couple of colleges with bizarre rules: FORMAL HALL IS NOT COMPULSORY, it's a thing you might do if you're celebrating something (e.g. a birthday), just like you might go out to a nice restaurant to celebrate something, just within your college. To put it in context, I ate in hall almost every day last term, and went to Formal Hall maybe three times. That's probably about average, maybe slightly above average.


6) Other than the fact that everyone there will be pretty bright and hopefully somewhat thoughtful, there is honestly no generic profile of a Cambridge student. Don't listen to anyone who tells you that all Cantabs are private-school educated, upper class snobs, that is an outdated stereotype. Yes, you will come across those sorts of people, but you will come across many others besides.

I don't think this is the case, even in the bleeding edge of web development (which is where I work).  Yes, it's easy to get left behind the cool kids if you don't learn the latest toolkit, framework, or whatever is hip this week.  But behind all of that, the core principles of software development haven't changed in the 30 or so years that I've been doing it.

SQL (the predominant language for querying databases) is now 40 years old.  The ""famous four"" of web programming languages are Perl (27 years old), Python (23), Ruby (21) and PHP (20).  Javascript (one of, if not *the* language of web development for the foreseeable future) is 20 years old and even jQuery is over 8 years old.  They're not going anywhere any time soon.

Sure, you have to learn new languages, tools and other technologies all the time if you want to keep up.  But any half-decent developer will be doing this anyway.  I cut my teeth in an era when you had to buy a book to learn a new language or technology (often *several* books because you had no idea which books where good and which were bad until you got a few chapters in).  Now I can read about something new on reddit, hacker news or stack overflow, google it and run through an online tutorial or two in less time than it takes me to drive to the book shop.

That said, burnout is a very real phenomena (been there, done it, got the T-shirt).  In some cases it's down to bad management who treat developers as disposable assets.  More often than not (in my unscientific opinion), it's down to the psychology of your typical programmer: highly focussed, self-motivated, high achiever types that think nothing of working through the night to get a job finished.  Not because their boss will fire them if they don't, but because they know they won't be able to sleep until the particular problem at hand is solved.

&gt;__Thomas Edward Neil Driberg, Baron Bradwell of Bradwell__ (22 May 1905 – 12 August 1976), generally known as __Tom Driberg__, was a British journalist, politician and [High Anglican churchman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_church) who served as a [Member of Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom) (MP) from 1942 to 1955 and from 1959 to 1974. A member of the [British Communist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Great_Britain) for more than 20 years, he was first elected to parliament as an Independent, and joined the [Labour Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK\)) in 1945. He never held any ministerial office, but rose to senior positions within the Labour Party and was a popular and influential figure in [left-wing politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics) for many years.

If you're a programmer relying on the language they taught you at Uni then that's a far bigger issue.

Knowing how to program a computer is like knowing how to fix a car.

Driving in London is beyond shit, takes forever and you will never find a place to park (unless you want to pay £10 an hour).
3) the whole of London is bursting with history so although it's great to go and see the tourist traps, make sure you allow yourself time to get lost in the back streets, wander through the parks and squares, and imagine living there 100/200/400 years ago when the buildings were built
4) the Brits aren't as excited to see Americans as vice versa. We get all your telly, and have a gazillion US tourists in London each year. Don't take it as being unfriendly, it's just not as exciting for us
5) London is a working city as well as being an amazing tourist place.

true,chouxinabox,null,null,"Funny how they're proposing conditionality of receiving ESA on being in treatment just for mental health claimants. When people with mental health issues have the highest 'want to work' rate of the disability groupings. And it's not like they're possibly the least capable group of fighting back... Oh wait. And 62% of WRAG sanctions are already handed out to MH claimants. 46% (50% according to the article that cites the 62% sanction number) of WRAG claimants are claiming because of MH. 

People who have no insight into their conditions do exist. Say someone's manic when they're offered treatment. They think they're absolutely fine. Better than fine. Maybe they even think they're God. Why would God need to be in therapy/taking mood stabilisers? 

Or people who're too ill to access treatment. Completely agoraphobic? Your GP/psychiatrist won't do home visits? Ah well. 

Or people who might be made worse by treatment? Reliving past traumatic experiences in therapy can be traumatic itself for example. Or it just may not be of any help and so it stops being on offer for you. And medication is definitely not for everyone. Interactions from other medications, impaired liver function meaning it won't metabolise the medication properly, serious side effects or them not being of any help.

And how are they defining treatment? Are they going to give ESA if someone has a repeat prescription for sleeping pills but no other treatment? If not, that's going to create some very worrying effects, particularly on people who have serious enough diagnoses that warrant treatment from a community mental health team. There's quite a big gap between being 'well' enough for your GP to feel comfortable treating you and being ill enough for the CMHT to accept a referral (much like the gap between JSA and ESA). And let's not forget budget cuts to the NHS, which disproportionately affect MH budgets. So getting that treatment is very difficult for some people. 

However, I fully agree with the idea of supporting people into accessing treatment. But not the way this is going to be implemented. Refer claimants to advocates. Or even get the job centre to hire some of their own. If the CMHT is being arsey about treatment, don't sanction the claimant, give them the advantage of a neutral, informed individual who can mediate.

I'm sorry, asking what the realistic, long-term prospects of a career choice counts as ""fear"" in your eyes?

Shit man, are you 15 and still rebelling against your parents or have you joined the rest of us yet as an actual, functioning adult who has to consider their life decisions and where they see themselves in the next 5, 10 years?

&gt; Uncertainty.

I... err... don't think you understand what uncertainty means. 

&gt; Doubt.

I'm sorry but that's not doubt either - that's a pretty fair question to ask when you are looking at going abroad for five years when your contemporaries are back in the UK networking and establishing their careers. 

I don't think it's unreasonable to ask what sort of prospects that someone might return to and it's highly irresponsible to just hand-wave and state that it will be alright when these are big decisions that will have a lasting impact on someone's life.

Maybe TEFL is the right choice for them, maybe it isn't. 

&gt; you shouldn't really be giving people advice unless you really are able to give some concrete information

I'm not giving advice other than to state that pretty much every single person I've known that has done TEFL has had no real plan in life and have really struggled when they eventually returned to the UK. 

My only advice (if you think that I'm giving it) is that it's worthwhile considering what long-term prospects there are, if any at all.

true,abw,cnty-uk,Surrey,"Current UK duty on hand rolling tobacco is £180.46 per kg ([source](https://www.gov.uk/alcohol-and-tobacco-excise-duty)).  That's 18p per gram or £4.50 for 25g.  Cost of 25g tobacco is around £8.50 of which around £1.50 is VAT.

    £ 2.50 : growing, processing, distribution, retail profit, etc.
    £ 4.50 : duty
    £ 1.50 : VAT

It costs 10p per gram to grow, harvest, process, distribute and sell tobacco, including all the profits made at every step along the way.  It's taxed at roughly 240% or 24p per gram (including VAT), or 180% / 18p (ex VAT).

There's no reason why cannabis can't be legally produced for the same ballpark cost as tobacco.

So even if it were taxed at the same rate as tobacco (3 to 4 times the 75% suggested) then it would work out around the same price: less than a tenner for 25g.

Current street price for cannabis is approx. £10 per gram, or £250 for that 25g packet.

Let me just say that again: **£8.50 for 25g of tobacco, £250 for 25g cannabis**.

Legal cannabis would have to be taxed at around 10,000% (100x) for it to end up at the same street price at present.

The European Commission (EC) is the executive body of the European Union responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the Union's treaties and day-to-day running of the EU.[2] Commissioners swear an oath at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, pledging to respect the EU Treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate.[3]

The Commission operates as a cabinet government, with 28 members of the Commission (informally known as ""commissioners"").[4] There is one member per member state, **though members are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state.**

I have enboldened the last few words as I find them rather ominous.

I also believe this commission, powerful as it is, is not democratically elected.

If you go back to the inter-war years the Labour movement was stronger in Belfast and there were times when Catholic and Protestant workers were working together on a large scale only to be driven apart by sectarian propaganda pushed by the unionists like in [1919](http://thegreatunrest.wordpress.com/2010/09/03/forgotten-history-the-belfast-engineering-strike-1919/) and [1932](http://libcom.org/history/1932-belfast-outdoor-relief-strike).

I'm looking at two sounds in particular (I can't say which as the experiment's ongoing!) and my hypothesis is basically this: as the generations have gone on, one of the more salient ""scouse"" sounds (with its origins in just one area of Liverpool) is gradually becoming more widespread across the city at the same time as another less salient but non-Liverpool sound has slowly begun percolating into or ""invading"" the accent.

The reasons for this are debatable, but this is where the sociolinguistic part comes in: since language and identity are closely linked, one possibility is that the diffusion of the salient scouse sound is symptomatic of a reaction to the threat of a loss of identity, and Liverpool certainly has a strong sense of identity which I don't think many scousers would like to lose. (This study is looking at three age groups; one includes people who were born/growing up in the Thatcher years...anyone remember Geoffrey Howe threatening the ""managed decline"" of our city? And until this last year or so, most old media was broadcast from London.)  But this is just one theory.

And of course, there's scores of other factors involved in determining who uses this salient sound and who doesn't, such as attitude to Liverpool and perceptions of social class etc.  But the main ones I'm looking at to spot a trend are age &amp; location.",0,1405247887,null,0,1405248437,0,ciw4moj,t3_2akm41,t1_ciw4moj,t1_ciw3xye,null,1434692401,3,false,Liverpool,t5_2r21z,3

My field is IT consulting, and I do electronics as a hobby.

I discovered Edinburgh has a [hacklab](http://www.edinburghhacklab.com), and from there I was pointed toward a networking event called [TechMeetup](http://techmeetup.co.uk/) and from there I managed to get a decent amount of freelance work to tide me over for the time being.

Then while working on a project at the hacklab I was approached by a couple who were looking for someone to help them with their startup, everything just kind of fell into place after that, and here I am today.

Unless you are in the middle of f'all nowhere, there's always some kind of networking event; just get out there and meet people whose interests line up with yours! Ask on your local sub if there are networking events; contact local Chambers of Commerce and Rotary Clubs (they will know), and eventually you'll find some.

In summer you can visit the Buckingham Palace state rooms, they have timed tickets that sell out really quickly. Have a look at [this](http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/visit/the-state-rooms-buckingham-palace). 

The tourist areas of London are safe but pickpocketing can be a problem, just be sensible and use street smarts. For instance if you are sitting in a pub, wrap the strap of your bag around the leg of your chair, don't put wallets in back pockets, don't flash loads of cash. 

You are going to be using public transport, which is plentiful, if you are here for 4 or more days it may be worth getting a 7 day travel card from a mainline train station. These cards cover you for train, underground, tram in the paid for zones and bus for all zones. If you get it at the train station you will be able to take advantage of the Days Out special offers - [Here](http://www.daysoutguide.co.uk/?gclid=CLCbgsGLwr8CFYnItAodOhUAww). Make sure that it is from the rail station and not underground because the offers are from the rail companies and not Transport For London. Many museums and galleries are free, but the majority of other sights don't need to be booked ahead and if you get there early enough you can avoid long lines - if you go to the Tower of London just as it opens and go to the Crown Jewels first you will miss the wait. The only things you need to pre-book are special exhibitions, tourist traps like Madam Tussauds, Buckingham Palace state rooms and the Ceremony of the Keys - [Here](http://www.hrp.org.uk/TowerOfLondon/WhatsOn/theceremonyofthekeys).

I've noticed that many American visitors are concerned about what they wear and sticking out. To be honest London is a very accepting place and people wouldn't care what you wear, just be comfortable.

I've been through depression and psychosis, and the treatment for it. Mental illness isn't a choice, but choosing to do nothing about it is. No matter how down you are, that is always true.

The state is not helping people by allowing them to make no effort to get better by having them refuse treatment and still getting money to live off. It's just allowing them to maintain their bad mental health indefinitely, which is not helping anyone. Sometimes people need a kick to start a process of getting out of depression because one of the main problems with depression is it makes you feel like doing *nothing*. 

'Normally' the kick to make you start to want to get better is you because you have people who depend on you like your kids, or you feel you need to get better to pay the bills etc or you'll lose your house. All the while this is horrible and can make you feel worse due to the pressure, but it's still a source to start a process to get better. If you have money just supplied to you and can just sit at home thinking about how depressed you are, you will not ever get that kick because you're stuck in an unmoving situation. 

This is not an ideal solution, it fucking sucks, but there is no ideal solution. Mental illness is horrible, but we can't support people who are refusing treatment. The government is not saying you must not be depressed, they're just saying you must at least see someone about the depression.

It's a bullshit tabloid, not a serious news source.

I know there have been a lot of rumours and unexpected convictions over the last few months, but has the intelligence of /r/unitedkingdom really descended to the point we're willing to believe unsubstantiated claims from some random yahoo in a tabloid newspaper as fact?

At the time of posting there are 52 comments on this thread, and not *one single one* (I know, because I just read them all) is even *suggesting* that this might not be a totally reliable, trustworthy source.

Just because there are rumours of a Tory paedophile ring, that doesn't mean any random guy who suddenly smells a way to make a profit off the story 20 years after he was involved in politics is credible.  He doesn't present one shred of evidence, the story doesn't contain one iota of outside corroboration, and it fights shy of mentioning anyone still alive who might sue - possibly because they don't want a court case, but more likely because he doesn't have a shred of evidence with which to substantiate his allegations.  He even ends his story with

&gt; once they had tired of me they simply discarded me

Clearly indicating he has a grudge against the people he's pointing to.

Whether that's because his story is true or because he simply didn't get anywhere in politics is completely unknown, but if it was remotely true you'd have thought that it would have been worth looking after the guy who supposedly watched a generation of MPs fucking kids on a production-line basis - tucking him away in a comfortable government sinecure simply to ensure his silence wouldn't have cost a lot, and it would have been a hell of a lot smarter than pissing off a guy with that kind of dirt on you.

Moreover, while at the time the age of consent was 21, nobody these days would be bothered about the idea that a gay MP might have been fucking an 18 year-old... but it only takes a couple of young-looking guys (or slight exaggeration on Gilberthorpe's part) to turn that into a story with the keyword ""paedophile"" in it, and suddenly it's worth hundreds of thousands in the current social/media climate.

true,AeroNotix,eng-lancashire,Lancashire,"&gt; [Some typical ad hominem internet drivel about teenage angst ]

Like I said, I was being facetious somewhat.

&gt; I'm not giving advice other than to state that pretty much every single person I've known that has done TEFL has had no real plan in life and have really struggled when they eventually returned to the UK.

Then you don't know enough people, since I *personally* did partake in working overseas as a TEFL teacher, I know firsthand what it requires in a person and the kinds of challenges a person will specifically come up against.

Depending on the country, I would be more than happy to employ a TEFL teacher in a wide range of demanding jobs. Expatriating is an extremely difficult thing to do for a lot of people. I hope I do not have to explain why?

&gt; but trying to turn someone away from it because it doesn't directly appeal to you is unfair.

Jimmies remain unrustled, young keyboard warrior. Since I *did* actually teach abroad and I remain in the country I originally went to *and* I make boatloads of cash, it turns out that deciding to work abroad was an extremely good decision for me.

It will not be the same for everyone, it requires hard work and some painful times in order to really make it work. I don't even teach English any more, but doing so put me into a position where I could take advantage of certain things (time, relative ease of job) to allow myself the time for personal growth so that I was able to get into a different field altogether.

Whilst TEFL can be a risky avenue for the unprepared, it definitely worked for me.

2 - Depends, if it was on the BBC, there'd be no ads, but other channels need them to fund the company.

3 - Can't say I've noticed, but there's local as well as national changes in dialect :)

4 - Yeah, people get mad about the 'nanny state' but in the end, if fines to stop people just tossing their rubbish onto the street work, I'm all for them, and yes, we've embraced recycling pretty well.

5 - Yeah, we're fairly free in terms of religion, and try to allow people the facilities needed to do their own thing.  Same goes for disabilities, we try to include braille, ramps, subtitles and textphone lines for the deaf, etc.

6 - Yes, there's private companies who install cash machines in places where there are none, and charge like £2 to take money out, whether you're withdrawing £10 or £100.  Just make sure it says free before you use them.

7 - Our markets do tend to do this, it's just done for speed really, a bowlful of anything will be a pound, but you don't get the bowl, they tip it into a bag for you.  Also saves a lot of messing about weighing one apple, and then working out the price per kilo for a very small profit.

8 - As stated below, yes, sadly they tend to open in poor areas where people will be more desperate for money and likely to need to sell their possessions.  Gambling places do the same.

9 - Ok, I know nothing about that :)

10 - Depends on the area, Chatham's probably a bit 'rougher' than where I live, usually you'll see maybe one in the whole town.

11 - Yeah, they're traffic lights or pedestrian crossings, and I agree it makes more sense to just let the traffic flow when there's no-one around.

12 - I believe it's more a case that we as a nation are still very uptight about sex in general, and many people would rather buy their condoms in a private transaction with a machine than go up to a real person and ask for some.

It's well known that paedophiles gravitate to positions of power or trust. Once there, they will form networks with others.  I guess this may be how paedophilia  became so entrenched in the RC church. 

It's been suggested that paedophilia is embedded in the culture of some of the public schools where our establishment tend to be educated. I don't know if there's any truth in this.

I expect (like all things sexual) paedophilia is a journey as much as an absolute proclivity, and paedophiles can be incredibly self deceiving and self justifying. Some of the oppressive laws probably stem from this. I can imagine the proponent thinking ""but I'm one of the *good* paedophiles"" or even ""I'm not a paedophile really, I just get carried away at some of these parties the chief whip organises. It's all *his* fault.""

There's also been some suggestions that the establishment and security services protect and promote paedophiles as a tactic, because it gives them a lot of leverage.

It promotes a culture of fear. Is simply saying ""There's nothing wrong with being gay"" promoting homosexuality? 
Thatcher's view of the kind of attitudes which were harmful to children in this way seem pretty shocking even to today's social conservatives, I would suggest.

&gt;At Park View School Ofsted reported that ""students are not taught citizenship well enough or prepared properly for life in a multi-cultural and diverse society.”[36]

&gt;The EFA inspection found a classroom culture which was not welcoming to non-Muslim pupils. It described a ""madrassa curriculum"" and reported that ""posters were written in Quranic Arabic in most of the classrooms visited. Posters were found in the classrooms encouraging children to begin lessons with a Muslim prayer, one saying: “If you do not pray, you are worse than a kafir”, and staff reported that loudspeakers were set up in the school to broadcast a call to prayer. The few pupils that elected to study a Christianity unit as part of the Religious Studies GCSE course had to ""teach themselves"", because the teacher focussed on Islamic studies which the majority were studying.[37][38]

&gt;Year 11 pupils about to sit their GCSEs at the school were instructed to partake in an Islamic fast, taking neither food nor drink, to place them in the right “spiritual frame of mind” for the exams. Additionally, students were expected to fast during the month of Ramadan. Some staff at the school expressed fear that neither eating nor drinking amid high temperatures during the 18 hours of daylight in the months of June and July would compromise pupils’ health and their ability to learning.[39]

&gt;The sexes were segregated in the classrooms and boys and girls suspected of being too friendly towards each other were disciplined. The Department for Education inspection found the seating arrangements “often with boys sitting towards the front of the class and girls at the back or around the sides”. The annual sports event for boys and girls was scheduled in different days.[39] Girls claimed to have been discriminated against and said some were sent home from a tennis tournament because their dress was too ""revealing"".[40]

&gt;Subjects such as Personal, Social and Health Education, Biology and Sex and Relationships Education were bowdlerised to conform with a conservative Islamic teaching. Pupils studying biology were not taught the section of the syllabus about Reproduction and the teacher stated when briefly outlining Evolution that ""this is not what we believe"".[41] A former staff member said that one teacher had handed out a worksheet stating that women “must obey their husbands,” and told his class that wives were forbidden from refusing their husbands sex.[38]

&gt;A former teacher at the school reported that the current head teacher, Monzoor Hussain, expressed “mind-blowing” anti-American views at school assemblies, describing the US as the “source of all evil in the world"".[6] In school assemblies, former staff alleged that a senior teacher frequently praised Anwar al-Awlaki, an al-Qaeda recruiter that had been involved with at least three major terror attacks, and referred to non-Muslims as “kuffar”, an insulting term for infidel. The teacher also used school facilities to copy Osama bin Laden DVDs. External speakers were improperly vetted.[36] An extended Islamic assembly for its Year 10 and 11 pupils was arranged with Sheikh Shady al-Suleiman, an extremist preacher who has called on God to “destroy the enemies of Islam”, “give victory to all the Mujahideen all over the world” and to “prepare us for the jihad”.[42]

* I waited a year for CBT, after being on antidepressants for 3 years. Did the course, it didn't help. Was told that the only way to get further treatment was to let myself deteriorate and get sectioned. 
* My chronic physical condition and the daily pain it causes contributes massively to my depression. At home there's no long term mental health support for the chronically ill. My only hope is inpatient treatment for my condition, which may include tips on managing a long term condition. Expert patient programme is not available in my area.
* Medication causes side effects. Every year or so I have to change antidepressant as the side effects become to severe. This involves going cold turkey and going through ssri withdrawal. Previous side effects have included tinnitus, increased chronic pain, not being able to sleep, massively increased anxiety and weight gain. They can also randomly stop working and send you into a downward spiral. I can see why some people don't want medication, it's far from perfect and you have to find a GP with enough time to keep track of you. Forcing imperfect medication on people is unethical.

So the family don't deserve justice because you'd rather make ad hominem attacks on supporters?

And obviously no one need examine your extensive post history of nationalist criticism.

Laughable. 

And yet the votes clearly demonstrate the natural bias that we are expected to believe does not exist. 

Make a screenshot of social media loyalist bigotry? 

Upvote away.

Make a serious post critical of Irish nationalism? 

Get reminded you're a loyalist and thus not qualified to discuss the matter.

But not only before the child even hits puberty. It's been a long time since we as a society used the beginning of puberty as the mark of adulthood.

/u/Loojay replied to this post with

&gt;Dude, that guy looked up sources to back up his claim, be ""intensely surprised"" all you like, but you don't know what you're talking about.

To which I replied with the following. Since he deleted his post while I was writing it, I'll just put it here.

He linked a Wikipedia article (which will give a technical definition), and a technical definition. However, I am talking about use of the word paedophilia in a common everyday setting. It is not unusual for a technical definition to be more concrete and specific than the everyday word.

&gt;Abuse a word for long enough and you've literally changed the meaning.

Obviously this does not apply to the technical meaning of the word.

If you ask an ordinary person if a 40 year old man who sexually abused his 15 year old niece is a paedophile, most will tell you yes. Some might comment that he's ""not as much of a paedo as someone who abuses 6 year olds"", but they would still think he ticks the paedophile box, if you'll pardon the pun.

The same people will tell you that the USSR was a Communist state. They might think malt vinegar is actually a vinegar and not an *alegar*. They might tell you that ""proof"" means ""strong evidence for something"" rather than ""a logical demonstration that certain conclusions follow from certain statements"". They might describe an arbitrary event as a random one. 

They might think David Cameron is *literally* a cunt.

They might be wrong according to Psychology Today - but the common everyday meaning of the word paedophile just means ""fancies kids"", and by ""kids"" we don't exclusively mean those who haven't hit puberty any more. Some of us don't see it as being as bad, to fancy pubescent kids rather than pre-pubescent ones. I'm not really here because of that. But we still call both of them paedophiles in everyday use. It's what the word means now.

I've no doubt psychologists continue to use paedophile in the way they always have.",1,1405255331,null,0,1405258390,0,ciw5xk7,t3_2aki7p,t1_ciw5xk7,t1_ciw5u3z,null,1434693009,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Moreover (another reason) the paper refused to name any still-living politician or figure (suggesting they were scared of legal challenges, in turn suggesting they didn't have compelling evidence to prove their involvement).

Given that, then the *only* evidence or factor even remotely in favour of this story is the journalistic integrity and reputation of the newspaper reporting it... and at that point the reputation of the paper absolutely comes into play.

But on the other hand, economies of scale are a good thing for us all as they lower costs, allow for more energy efficient production with lower emissions, and so on. 

I would be all in favour of allowing people to grow their own if they wanted to (even if they had to pay tax on their crop, pay for a licence, or whatever).  Lower taxation rates for smaller companies would also be a possibility in the same way that smaller companies pay less corporation tax.  But I don't think it's right in an open market to say that some companies are allowed to product any particular product and others aren't.

One way or another, even if it cost 5 or 10 times as much to product cannabis as tobacco, we're still talking less than £1 per gram, which is 1/10 of the current retail price.

* £26m would probably be a fair price for his current and potential ability

* He and Sturridge play in the same role so unless Brendan either finds a good balance with rotation or changes his formation to accommodate both one of them will be unhappy

I think Lukaku is a great player and would welcome this signing, but I think Brendan would find it a bit difficult, but not impossible to keep both him and Sturridge satisfied. I also think Chelsea would be crazy to sell Lukaku, especially to a rival team so although I would love this to happen, I doubt it will. 

But this rumour comes from CaughtOffside with no actual sources therefore probably means they have seen we have sold a striker and know Lukaku wont be the main striker at Chelsea and put them together to generate page views.

I'm fortunate in that I've never had to use a recruitment company, but I hear lots of lots of bad things about them from people who do.  My favourite story was the candidate who turned up for a job interview and asked to see his own CV (that the recruiters had sent the potential employer) so that he would know what bullshit they had added to it.  He was fed up of going to interviews to have people ask him ""I see you have X years experience in Y, can you tell us more about that"" when he didn't know anything about Y.

Why forbid councils from saying homosexual couples are 'acceptable'? And anyone who was actually harmed by it, that was just evil loony lefty councils deliberately misinterpreting it to make a point? It was deliberately vague. No one could give a straight answer over if it even applied to schools or not, although its creator maintained that was its primary purpose. But it did very real harm, even as a fringe of those on the right continued to stand by it. 


Even David Cameron, a previous vocal supporter of Section 28,now recognises the damage it did. The only people who seem to keep arguing the toss are the latest generation of rebellious little tory boys who think they're being oh so controversial and somehow railing against the common consensus. Or who only found out about it the day before and think they can put a positive spin on it by just interpreting the text of the legislation without actually having even a remedial understanding of its intention or effects. 

Even if you claim the legislation had no direct legal implications, surely you can understand the social effects of having an official government stance that homosexuality can be 'promoted', ie you can convince kids to choose to be gay? That homosexuals are targeting children? That homosexual support groups were actually homosexuality promotion groups? If a kid comes to a teacher because they're being bullied for being gay, how do you tackle that while bearing in mind you can't make homosexual relationships seem ""acceptable""? 

Section 28 put those behind it firmly on the wrong side of history.

Says the guy linking unironically to the Daily Mail.

If you're asking ""did they use reasonable journalistic standards when printing their stories, in line with every other newspaper of record at the time?"" (in the early-mid 1980s, the Statesman was a hefty outlet of investigative journalism, compared to the left-wing punditry that it prints now), then yeah, their stories would probably stand up on that basis.

If you're asking 'Do they have no opinions or biases whatsoever clouding their choice of what stories to write or how to depict the facts they're writing about?', then the answer is 'No, don't be silly, there's no such thing as a neutral source'. ALL news outlets have opinions and biases of that nature. When it comes to factual works, you evaluate the treatment, methodology, plausibility, provenance and whatnot of the facts presented and work on that basis, rather than say 'That guy's a unionist/republican/brit apologist therefore we can't listen to him'.

It depends - for example I would argue that there's a lot of difference between someone violently raping a toddler and someone having ""consensual"" (obviously they can't legally consent, but you know what I mean) underage sex with an overdeveloped 15 year-old, possibly without even knowing their age.  To argue otherwise seems like an *incredibly* black-and-white worldview.

The keyword ""paedophile"" is a very powerful taboo and a thought-terminating cliche - possibly the most powerful one in society today - like ""terrorist"" in the USA (in fact let's talk about that, because it's less emotive for us so we can reason about it more clearly and easily).

Terrorist used to have a precise meaning - ""someone who tries to incite popular terror to effect political or social change"", usually with murder, property damage and similar harm.

Then after 9/11 it became the bête noire of American society - suddenly everyone who wanted to cheaply and easily get people on their side in an issue started describing the other side as ""terrorists"", to the point that now it's used to describe non-violent hackers, government and corporate whistleblowers and people who make stupid, obvious jokes on Twitter.

The word has stopped being a valid, useful label with a precise definition, and become a way to instantly smear anyone they like and fix them as the target of that day's [Two Minute Hate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Minutes_Hate).  It doesn't mean anything any more except ""this is a person You Must Hate"", neatly bypassing your conscious mind and going straight for your emotional core, triggering all sorts of instinctive in-group and social-compliance mechanisms in the brain to make you think the way someone wants without the bothersome process of them actually justifying their case.

To tie this back, ""paedophile"" is a similar case - people inaccurately *use* it to mean ""anyone who has sex with an under-16 year-old"" (or sometimes, even less accurately, ""under-18""), but when you say ""paedophile"" the image everyone gets is (and I apologise in advance for the disgustingness of this image, but that's exactly my point) ""a disgusting old man horrifyingly trying to cram his cock into a screaming baby"".

Now don't get me wrong - someone having sex with a 15 year-old is pretty gross, but I think even we can acknowledge that the idea of someone doing that is orders of magnitude less distressing than the other image I just invoked.

Not in any way to defend it, but the second image is something that could even happen by accident if the individual looked older than their years, whereas the first is absolutely, unarguably, incontrovertibly heinous, cruel and disgusting at a fundamental, core level.

In the context of this story, Tory MPs were allegedly having sex with underage rent-boys, though it's worth mentioning that the age of consent for homosexuals at the time was 21, which few people would now agree was justified.

There's a claim that some of the boys were ""as young as 15"", which given the inherent interest of the journalist in sensationalising their writing, means the *very youngest* could reasonably pass for 15 *at the very youngest*.

The age of consent for homosexual sex in the UK is 16 now.

It's not like anyone asked to see the boys' passports or birth certificates.

So basically we have someone seeking to sell a story, whose *best allegation* is that MPs *might* have had sex with boys who *looked* like they might have been *one year* at most under the age of consent we now consider reasonable for homosexual sex.

Given the individual variability and variation in the age people look compared to their chronological age, that's actually a surprisingly weak case to allege something as serious as paedophilia.  While it was illegal at the time and even *at best* pretty hideously gross now, it's not even clear whether something we'd *currently* consider a crime was necessarily even committed at all.  It deserves investigation, certainly, but it's not even clear whether it's what we'd consider child abuse now, rather than straightforward prostitution.

However, slap a label like ""paedophilia"" on that story and suddenly people get the mental image of MPs renting babies and toddlers to fuck, get understandably het-up and emotional and then later, when they learn the details, those feelings *don't go away*.

They're already upset, they're already out for blood and want to see someone strung up from a lamp-post, regardless of whether in retrospect it's entirely justified or proportionate.

I'm not saying that these MPs don't deserve investigation, prosecution if it's proven they had sex with an underage boy, or even *retrospective* prosecution if it's proven that they had sex with someone under 21 when it was illegal to do so.

I'm also not saying that it's not *thoroughly gross* for rich, powerful men to rent vulnerable, possibly-homeless teenage boys, provide them with drink and illegal drugs and then use them as sexual playthings *even if* they would be technically considered ""of age"" today.

What I *am* saying, however, is that it's always very, very important to watch out for people mis-using terminology, engaging in hyperbole and other propaganda techniques to emotionally and subconsciously manipulate the audience's reactions to a story, especially when it's for the express purpose of whipping up public hysteria and obscuring the nuances and important details of the story in the interests of selling more papers, making more money and advancing their careers.

Lies, exaggeration and misrepresentation are still bad and should still be criticised *on principle*, even when they're ""only"" being used to *exaggerate* the shittiness or criminality of a bunch of pervy, reprehensible old fucks.

Also be warned, a nice old pub in london/anywhere will likely charge well over £4 for a pint, so don't expect your cash to go far. If you do end up in one, try one of their house beers/ales/lagers/etc, they're normally the same price and much nicer. If you're not sure what to have , ask the bartender what's good.

It's not hard to find nice old pubs in London, especially if you use a guide (as on the other reply to this comment). Or just walk through any busy part of London and go into anything which looks nice, you'll find somewhere good pretty fast.

If you're after a Harry Potter experience (rather than just an old pub), consider looking round some of the older university cities nearby. For example [Oxford](http://www.danlj.org/~danlj/photos/Europe/UK/Oxford/ChristChurch/ChristChurchHall-2003DecF-007_30a.jpg) and [Cambridge](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/TrinityCollegeCamGreatCourt.jpg) both have some lovely buildings and old pubs too, and are about an hour or 40 minutes away by train. Some of it's unbelievably old - both have colleges dating back before 1300.

The trouble with the space industry is that it often gets seen at this sort of ""benchmark"" industry that a nation can have which will make it hugely wealthy... but actually I'm not convinced there is as much cash in the space industry as people might imagine. I certainly don't think we're ever going to have an economy in which the space industry makes up a significant par of our GDP. Companies like Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL) are already doing a great job in this field... and short of a retarded amount of government investment I don't see anything drastic changing.

The US has an extraordinary space industry for two reasons, the first is that they spent their national treasure and nearly two decades of time investing in the space industry as part of their ""my dick is bigger than yours"" cold war with Russia. And secondly because of their absurdly large and wealthy defence aerospace industry which is effectively subsidized by government funding into grants for aerospace technologies and equiptment.

true,davidsmeaton,lfc68,,"i disagree. Being partnered with Suarez and getting the support from players like Courtinho has given Studge a huge confidence boost. He's a different player now than when we bought him. 

For a striker, football is all head games. He was unhappy at Chelsea and desperate for time on the pitch. He wanted to prove himself. He's done that at Liverpool and now he can focus on his game. Studge played well when Suarez was out and will be a great front man for us.

My opinion is that Liverpool has never been a one-man team. With Suarez leaving, now is our chance to prove it. We bring in quality players and instead of relying on one person to score 30+ a year we look to our squad to bang in goals. Stevie 10+, Sturridge 20+, Courtinho 10+, Sterling 10-15+ goals, Lallana 10+ etc ... that's the type of football Rogers is building on and that's the way the team has played since I've been a fan.

true,Jatngz,null,null,"&gt; To tie this back, ""paedophile"" is a similar case - people inaccurately use it to mean ""anyone who has sex with an under-16 year-old"" (or sometimes, even less accurately, ""under-18""), but when you say ""paedophile"" the image everyone gets is (and I apologise in advance for the disgustingness of this image, but that's exactly my point) ""a disgusting old man horrifyingly trying to cram his cock into a screaming baby"".

If native speakers of a language commonly use a word to refer to a certain idea, then it doesn't make sense to call it ""inaccurate"".  And if people do commonly use the word in this way, then I don't think you can seriously argue that they picture something completely different when they hear the word.  When I hear ""paedophile"" I picture one person over the age of consent, one person under the age of consent, and a big age gap between them (i.e., not a 16-year-old and a 15-year-old).  As far as I know, it's far more common for adults to molest teens or pre-teens than babies, so I don't know why anyone would think of the latter.

To be honest, I'm having trouble with the moral distinction you are making between molesting older children and younger children.  We know that molesting children does a great deal of harm, so we have to have a cut-off somewhere, and I'm not sure if it's necessarily the case that younger children suffer more than older children.  If someone below the age of consent is plausibly pretending to be much older than they are, and appears to be consenting, then it's different, but I'm pretty sure that's rare.  Anyway, in my view, it would be incredibly creepy and immoral for Cabinet ministers to pay teenagers for sex regardless of whether they are 13 or 19.

You're forgetting another big angle here: the dishonesty and hypocrisy.  The people alleged to be involved in this were, presumably, mostly in monogamous relationships and all of them were part of a deeply homophobic government that routinely punished people for having adult, consensual same-sex relationships (I'm mainly thinking of the ban on soldiers having same-sex relationships, which I believe was rigidly enforced at this stage).

true,Stompy119,null,null,"1. I would prefer Lovren over Bony, not because I don't rate him but purely because he is what we need. The striker ""issue"" can be dealt with January or even next summer. It's not as pressing as airing up our defense and making sure that it works with Poch. Clearly Lovren fits the system and is a no brained for a choice.

2. Again, we don't have room to sell Verts and bring in Bony. We need the bodies on the defensive end. Paulinho I was really hoping would step it up and reclaim confed cup form at this WC but it didn't happen. I'm not big on one-and-dones for new players especially with new language/league being such a huge adjustment. That being said, I would move Paul for Bony because we have such a thick midfield. That is of course as long as the price is right.

3. I think Bony will fit. He's a workhorse who has the skill/touch to set up his teammates which is something that is critical with the free-flowing forwards running off of the big man. While he's similar to Ade, Ade does have the tendency to drop deep/drift wide which is not what we need from the forward as much in Poch's system. 

4. I guess see 3. Haha. Some argue that we don't know if Ade will keep up his form, we don't know if Bony will either. With one season in the premier, he's just as much of a wildcard for me. That said I think both will be strong next season. Bony is younger by 5 years. If the price is right, I see no problem with purchasing despite Ade staying.

5. Our competition probably looks easier at this point. Ricky and Sturridge are no slouches and with Bobby having the season he did, I would think that Bony sees our team as easier to walk in. That said, we don't have CL and there is a gap now with Suarez gone so it would not surprise me at all if we see Bony suit up in red next season.

I'm sure many share my point of view, but defense is first and foremost for me. We were far too loose and leaky. We need the LB problem solved and we need to not play Daws in Poch's system. To me, that means he needs to go despite being such a servant to the club. I would rather a CB and a LB any day over Bony because I think Lamela and Chadli will produce a lot more this year as well as Townsend coming into his own under Poch. The goal load will not rest on Eriksen and Ade alone again. ",0,1405265199,null,0,false,0,ciw8pie,t3_2al4ag,t1_ciw8pie,t3_2al4ag,null,1434694397,9,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,9

And when you cut an animal's throat, it does't ""suffocate on its own blood"". It dies do to lack of blood to the brain.

true,OptioMkIX,null,null,"The answer to that is specialisation. You're right in that we're in bad place for anything that could really do with being in an equatorial or equatorial-ish orbit. We are well placed for polar orbits or highly inclined ones which while niche has some applications.

One specialisation that we really should shoot for is the launch of small microsatellites - Cube or pocketqube sats. They're small, light, and crucially there is a big lack of any dedicated launcher for them, you have to piggyback on large launches which means A) You dont get the timing you want (because the large payload takes priority) B) Its really fucking expensive per kg to orbit. 

They're also one of the quickest growing parts of the satellite industry. You can even get Cubesats with ion engines in them now, so they're a steal for doing an interplanetary or lunar probe on the (relative) cheap. They wouldnt require an absolutely massive rocket to be built and launched. You could get away with something not too dissimilar to a sounding rocket, or any kind of relatively light hybrid or liquid fuelled rocket.

This is in fact, exactly what the Norwegian company Nammo Raufoss is doing with their [North Star rocket currently under development.](http://www.rocketrange.no/wp-content/files/2013/01/NorthStar.pdf)

Norway is a country of only 5 million people and yet they've got an active rocket development program. We've got 60 million at last count and the best we can do is dragging our feet for fucking years.

I've been in web development (and related back-end stuff) pretty much exclusively for the past 20 years so I'm a bit out of touch with how things work in the corporate programming sector.  But here in web land, it's pretty much expected that you'll know HTML, CSS, Javascript, at least one web programming language (PHP/Python/Perl/Ruby), enough SQL to write basic database queries, how to use Git or some other version control system, some other basic Linux commands, and so on.  In most cases, you're expected to learn those things yourself, or with help from your colleagues.  Learning new stuff is an ongoing part of the job, which is partly what makes it so interesting.  And best of all, there are a wealth of resources out there to help you learn this stuff.

I totally appreciate the fact that this might not apply to your particular situation, and I hope it doesn't come across as me trying to gloat about how great we have things ""over here"".  But perhaps it might encourage you to know there are other parts of the IT world where people have a lot more fluidity in their skills and opportunities to adopt new technologies.  It's never too late to learn new skills, particularly in IT where the information you need is a google away.

&gt;The __Battle of the Boyne__ ([Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language): *Cath na Bóinne*, IPA: [ˈkah n̪ˠə ˈbˠoːn̪ʲə]) was fought in 1690 between two rival claimants of the English, Scottish, and Irish thrones – the Catholic [James VII &amp; II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_II_of_England) and the Protestant [William III and II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_III_of_England) (who, with his wife, Mary II, James's daughter, had [deposed James in 1688](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution)) – across the [River Boyne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Boyne) near [Drogheda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drogheda) on the east coast of [Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland). The battle, won by William, was a turning point in [James's unsuccessful attempt to regain the crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamite_War) and ultimately helped ensure the continuation of [Protestant ascendancy in Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Ascendancy).

true,Monarki,null,null,"This WC showed the world exactly the type of player Luiz is. He's a great CB evidenced by the first few games he was great but then he can easily go from being amazing to an absolute shit show evidenced by his last 2 games. It's actually a gamble with Luiz because you never which Luiz will turn up or how long ""Great CB Luiz"" will be in the game before ""shitshow Luiz"" takes over.

Yes he helped immensely at times, especially in the CL where he was our main CB at times, with Cahill still developing and Terry being average at times. And he stepped up in the Barca game and final when Terry wasn't there. However there is a reason he has this reputation he did make mistakes in the premier league that costed us.

You should never have to be worried about a defender in your team you shouldn't have a gamble player like that, because imo his negative attributes far outweigh the positive. Most of the time we don't really notice it because when he goes on those runs Silva or Terry is there to cover for him, but that's not how it's supposed to be in our team Terry shouldn't be cleaning up after Luiz's mess.

One more think he gets complacent and sometimes just doesn't think, you saw it against Germany and it reminded of that goal conceded against Cech. Luiz literally faked out Cech his own keeper! A player he's supposed to protect! Ramires passed the ball back to Luiz, Cardiff player runs to the ball and so is Luiz however Luiz decides to skip it and let Cech fetch it. So cech realise late that he has to fetch it but Mutch has the head start, gets to it first and scores.

A handful of ancient studies being cherry picked does not, an argument, support.

&gt;I am not saying YOU are a racist.

No, you're not saying it, you're implying it. In fact, the creators of this defence have done a marvellous job of defending their barbaric practise. Don't call people racist, don't actually even *imply* people are racist, but rather imply that they *would* be racist if they were arguging against halal slaughter. Very clever, but equally wrong.

&gt;It's silly trying to say that Halal is any more cruel than, say, battery chickens, or mass-produced pork.

Halal slaughter without stunning is unjustifiable cruelty to animals. The very fact that it's not legal to slaughter animals in such a way unless one has a skyman to justify it is enough in itself to show that it's wrong.",0,1405267627,null,0,false,0,ciw9mco,t3_2ais6f,t1_ciw9mco,t1_ciw9hng,null,1434694840,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

I like the analogy that they're painkillers. Imagine you had immense back pain and the only way for you to get rid of it was physiotherapy. In order to actually be able to do the treatment, you'd need a hefty dose of painkillers just to get you out of bed. Anti-depressants are like that for most people, they dull the symptoms long enough for you to actually give a shit about improving your life. 

I have no idea where you're getting the last point from because it completely opposes the actual medical reasoning behind giving them in the first place. I can only assume you have a history with somebody you know taking them and reacting badly. 

&gt;They're a sticking plaster, lazy solution to a problem which is too costly in time and manpower to fix easily, so instead of helping patients who desperately need a permanent fix, GP's medicate them into meek compliance. It's easier for them to treat the side effects of antidepressants than it is to get them the long term psychoanalytical help they need to get better.

I agree and I disagree at the same time. Mental health support in this country is a joke, but I can't match your level of cynicism.

true,DemonEggy,null,null,"&gt; A handful of ancient studies being cherry picked does not, an argument, support.

I've only found ONE study of different methods of slaughtering animals, and it suggests slitting the throat is no more cruel than stunning the brain. That's not cherry-picking, and if you can find me any study (not a letter from an animal rights group, and actual *scientific study*) that suggests otherwise, I'd be more than happy to read it, and change my view if necessary.

And again, I'm not saying you're racist. Your only reason for opposing Halal may well be that you think it's cruel. My argument is that you think it's cruel because you've been *told* it's cruel, and you've been *told* it's cruel by people with an agenda. Again, I haven't heard ANYONE banging on about Kosher meat, and that's slaughtered in exactly the same way. And I bring it back to the point that there's an awful lot of terrible practices in the meat industry, why is THIS ONE getting headlines? Why is the Daily Mail not running articles on factory pork, or battery farm chickens? 

And again, back to the point that 90% of halal meat IS stunned before slaughter. So yeah, if you want to argue that not stunning is cruel, that's fine (although I still want proof), but the fact that 90% of Halal meat doesn't even fall into that category suggests, by your logic, that the vast, vast majority of Halal meat is not cruel at all. 

So campaign against cruel slaughter, or unethical treatment of animals. But by your own definition, 90% of halal meat isn't cruel at all.

Irish Catholicism became politicised and associated with nationalism in the 19th century, when nationalist politicians used the infrastructure of the Catholic church to spread their message. Lots of prominent Irish nationalists have been Protestant. 

Northern Ireland happened to have closer ties to Britain through heritage and trade, and also had a higher Protestant population. When Ireland received its own government, Northern Ireland resisted, fearing that its economy and culture would be overwhelmed in an Ireland ruled from Dublin. 

The problems started because the Northern Irish state wasn't 100% unionist, and nationalists - the vast majority Catholic - were marginalised under Stormont rule. This lasted from the 1920s to the 1960s, when a civil rights movement started. This quickly caused friction between the two sides as unionists felt their position was threatened and nationalists felt unable to demonstrate for better rights. Extreme elements on both sides turned to violence while politicians struggled to find consensus.

The Orange Order is both pro-Protestant and pro-union, and they march because it's a traditional part of their heritage. The marching is only controversial when it passes through areas where residents consider a pro-Protestant Unionist victory parade inflammatory.

This could of course be explained as a bluff on the part of the Doctor.

The only possible exploration for how regeneration could be presented as option is if both the TARDIS and the Doctor have forgotten about the existence of the War Doctor.  

There are explanations for all of these scenes, but together they all point to the idea that the writers of the show were not considering this to be his last regeneration until The Day of the Doctor and The Time of the Doctor, which is really the first time we get any indication that 11 cannot regenerate again.

I guess that HR/Recruiters tend to think that 'web stuff' is all the same and if you're a web developer you can do any of it, but they seem to view high level languages as like human languages, and you wouldn't hire a German speaker to translate Russian. 

Obviously IT is broad and different parts of it work differently and have vastly different pay scales and skill requirements.

You think people should be allowed celebrate and so do I but the problem is those who turn the celebration into a harassment of the minorities it becomes a problem.

There's so much to see here as well - you can do a 'Harry Potter' tour where they take you to see all the bits of the university that were used in the filming, but I would recommend a more general tour which incorporates those places anyway (and they are much cheaper!). Oxford's great for eating and drinking too, and if you have time you should definitely head to one of the museums for a quick look around as they are pieces of history themselves, never mind the exhibits! Seriously, I could carry on. If you have any questions about Oxford let me know. I can recommend some amazing 'old' pubs if you come here!

I would HIGHLY recommend that you consider putting it into your holiday itinerary if you are over here anyway.

Media *here* is more 'on the fence' about it. They'll mention the contentious parades and some of the complaints, but they'll also cover the 'festivities', while widely avoiding the awful things put on some bonfires.

Contentious parades, for me, because of the *extreme* persistence and insistence of the Orange Order that they be allowed to march through areas like the Garvaghy Road (widely nationalist area) waving banners and flags of UVF men who *may* have even killed members of that community is *all the proof and evidence I need* to conclude that they are *indeed* triumphalist, sectarian, and supremacist marches.

The Orange Order and people of N. Ireland that celebrate the 12th will of course disagree with me - but I'd genuinely like to know how they cannot see or won't agree that that shit shouldn't be allowed - if you're on r/northernireland and support the type of march through Garvaghy Road, please explain why.

Other evidence for the supremacist, sectarian, racist argument would be the vast racist comments always put up on bonfires every year - this year they targeted: homosexuals, Anna Lo (a Chinese MLA here, Ironically from Hong Kong when it was a British Colony like us, so she's as British as those celebrating the 12th), Black people, Sinn Fein MLAs, suicide victims, cancerous children (because the child in question was catholic) ...

&gt;On 6 May 2008 plans were announced for the Craig Bellamy Foundation in [Sierra Leone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone).  Bellamy first visited the formerly war-torn West African country in 2007 and has subsequently invested £1.4m of his own money  to build a not-for-profit football academy in the [Western Area Rural District](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Area_Rural_District) village of [Tombo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tombo,_Sierra_Leone) where 32 boys receive an international standard education and elite-level football coaching for free. By positioning football alongside education  the Craig Bellamy Foundation hopes to produce well-rounded young men with bright futures both on and off the pitch.

OK, see, what it is, there's this thing called an election coming up. Now some people will tell you that it's linked to a really complex and subtle system of government but that's all smoke and mirrors. Actually what it is is a popularity contest which only two parties can outright win or maybe form a government with the third party if they're unlucky.

So to be more popular than their rivals the two parties will attempt various strategic and tactical manoeuvres.

This tactic, which has been successful at some times and not so much at others is to put up more female candidates at the next election, the reasoning being that women will vote disproportionately for women.

So in this instance where the vital component of the job is getting female voters to vote Tory along gender lines then women are going to be better for that job.

That said if you really want to be involved there's nothing stopping you; you just have to put in a bit of effort.

I'd recommend a look at the wikipedia pages for Man City history, and definitely a close look at the page about MCFC supporters.

I hope none of this comes across as condescending.

The one thing I'd suggest that doesn't seem to be covered by others is that its not really a walking city. Its massive and as such attractions can be far apart. Don't be averse to taking the tube (the single best underground system I've used, rivalled only by the Munich system). You can get day/group tickets or even pick up an Oyster card (google will tell you more about that) and use that to travel around. The tube is pretty self-explanatory, but don't be afraid to ask anyone who works their, or doesn't look like they're in a hurry for help. The only other advice for the tube is notice which side people stand on the escalator and follow their lead. 

Make sure you visit lots of diverse things, if you're soccer fans, the stadiums will be hosting friendly games and tours which should be easy to get tickets for. Carnaby street and Soho are still pretty hip if you're into that kind of thing. Camden Market is a must (not sure if its on every day). If you want the Cockney experience, they're from East London, though don't expect everyone to speak like DVD in Mary Poppins. The Natural History museum is fascinating, as is the British museum. Try to catch a show in the West End, as well. I've seen Les Mis and Phantom and I'd recommend them both. Try to get tickets before hand from a reputable, cheaper vendor. After that, try to get out of the city at least one day.

No, why would they change? They will continue to use office to further
the various interest groups with which they are in partnership.  To do
otherwise would be to lose the support of those interest groups and
jeopardise the party's chance of winning office.  In a democracy it is
virtually impossible for a party to serve the wider public interest.

The public senses that there is something wrong and is obviously
unhappy with the establishment.  But the public is far too large a
group to be able to organise and therefore cannot apply any sustained
attention to a remedy, even if it had the collective wit to know how.

We can divide the workforce into two halves: skilled and unskilled. 

For unskilled work, pay is a motivator, but unskilled work in the UK can't generate enough wealth to provide a motivating level of income. The solution here is inevitably some sort of Basic Income: give a reasonable standard of living to the unemployed, and make sure every hour worked pays over and above that. 

For skilled work, pay isn't so much of a motivator - I mentioned the video to illustrate this. There's a shortage of skilled workers which if addressed will create further skilled and unskilled jobs. The solution here is more training and proper apprenticeships.

HSBC are, by-and-large, rather reasonable.

But their customer service has been pretty good and I've been fairly happy as far as ordinary banking is concerned. Impossible, of course, to keep track of different savings rates. I've got 3 savings accounts all defunct and God only knows what interest rate I'm getting.

Nationwide were the only bank that allowed my foreign partner a current account when she first arrived in the country. So I give huge props to them for that. I'm not hugely experienced in Nationwide but pretty happy so far.

Halifax were the only bank that gave me a mortgage - plus their travel insurance is possibly one of the best (from the legal terms point of view). However they are dodgy as hell when it comes to trying to trick you into things - like misleading pages with a huge CONTINUE button that actually switches you to e-statements from paper billing. I'm rather fucked off with them for that and there's no way in hell I'd choose to have an ordinary bank account with them. There was some other dodgy shit they tried to pull - I forget what it was.

Fagging is often associated with the public school discipline structure, which today allows senior prefects to assign younger students to detention.

I think there was probably a bit of a clean-up in the late 60's or the mid-70's - until then prefects were still allowed to cane their juniors. That was done pretty casually - someone whispering in assembly would be struck with the tip of the cane to shut them up.

Caning still occurred in the 80's for serious infractions, ones not so serious as to merit suspension, but I believe it was administered by the head. Didn't happen often - I can only remember hearing about it once.

The most depraved thing I ever heard about was a couple of boarders saying they'd played [soggy biscuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soggy_biscuit). Dormitories had 4 beds, and only partial privacy partitions - the lads were living away from home, so were close-knit; I wouldn't be surprised if some ""experimentation"" went on, but actual abuse would not have been tolerated.

true,tusksrus,cnty-uk,Manchester,"&gt;You have valid points, but they are a potential danger

You have to consider the liberty of the individual. We can't go around punishing people for illnesses they have just because it makes them a potential danger. You might as well chemically castrate all heterosexual men because sometimes they rape women.

Paedophilia and homosexuality are not directly comparable, you are right. But the difference is not in responsibility for their attractions (a separate issue from responsibility of their *actions*). The difference is that children are not widely considered as capable of something like consent, whereas members of the same sex as you are. It does not in my mind justify chemical castration just because of potential threats. It defies the principle of people being innocent until they are proven guilty.

If there was evidence to believe that most paedophiles abuse a victim at some stage in their life, you might have a point. But as far as I am aware there is no evidence on paedophiles who don't abuse - we don't know if there are lots or none. If we believe in the principle of being innocent until proven guilty, we can't assume all paedophiles abuse.

Chemical castration also sounds inhumane. We're a better country than that in a better time.",0,1405281569,null,0,1405282317,0,ciwfj3m,t3_2aki7p,t1_ciwfj3m,t1_ciwaptc,null,1434697697,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

The success of CBT relies entirely on the persons willingness to engage with the process. One of the fundamental principles of CBT is that the therapist is essentially a facilitator, they encourage the patient to set their own goals and give them the tools to achieve those goals but it requires commitment and readiness to change on the part of the individual. The skills learned in therapy also have to be practiced between sessions or they simply won't take. 

Whoever came up with this moronic scheme clearly has no knowledge of psychological therapies whatsoever, they've just read that CBT sometimes works in as little as six sessions (emphasis on sometimes, for some people whose problems are relatively mild) and decided that it sounds like good value for money. 

The fact is that psychological therapies don't work unless the person is ready and willing to make changes. If they're not ready and willing it's probably for reasons that are many,varied and too psychologically complex to be understood by a government whose singular motivation appears to be abdicating responsibility for those that depend on them.

What about re-negotiating trade agreements? Transport agreements? The hell happens to the channel tunnel? Does it all go back to pre-EU times or does it all get re-calculated?

Since HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales are in part replacing HMS Ocean (the dedicated helicopter landing platform) they will also be responsible for the UK's 67 [Apache Helicopters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AgustaWestland_Apache), as well as the Chinook fleet... then in 2018 they will fly the F35B Lightening II...

The carriers are incredibly complex things. You don't just buy one for billions of pounds, stick thousands of people, explosives, combustible fuels and aircraft on it and figure it out as you go... Once the ships are structurally complete they'll need to spend a significant period of time at sea simply figuring out the ""ship"" parts of the aircraft carrier before they even start to think about aviation operations. Then once the ship part is sorted they can think about embarking aircraft and slowly building up.

I can appreciate the frustration at not having a carrier, or seemingly having ""useless carriers""... but the reality is very different. Just because ships like this are fitted out doesn't mean they are ready for operations. The real failure in the carrier program was NOT the lack of suitable aircraft for it... but rather the fact that the program was deliberately delayed to spread costs and sustain jobs whilst simultaneously axing the existing carriers and harrier jets to save money. **These new carriers will be excellent and we are lucky to have them, and the same can also be said for the F35B**.

However, to argue that the UK has carriers but no aircraft for them simply isn't true, since;

* A) We don't have any carriers until they are structurally complete, fitted out (which neither is yet), crewed and operational AFTER sea trials. So (excluding HMS Ocean) we don't have any carriers.

* B) Once the above is done, we WILL have aircraft to fly off them... the Apache helicopter fleet. Whilst they might not be suitable for every sort of operation they are better than nothing.

* C) Within 2 years of completing sea trials the F35B will be ready to fly off the deck anyway.

--------

**On a side note**: A lot of planners in the defense industry are actually happy with the pace of the carrier program. Although over budget, it is actually considerably ""less"" over budget than a lot of comparable defense projects. It also looks set to deliver an ambitious set of ships within the contracted time. Then above all, air forces all over the world are currently undergoing a very rapid change where nobody is quite sure what the balance of manned fighters vs drones will be in the future. Procrastinating a little bit on the F35B might not be a bad thing, as although it seems very likely the carriers will fly them, the mainstay of the air-wing might actually end up being navalised drones - particularly considering some of the newer, more ambitious unmanned aircraft like the [BAE Taranis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Taranis), which whilst unmanned are closer to multirole fighters in terms of performance.

When the carrier was conceived, the idea was to have an air wing of about 40 modern 5th Generation fighter jets... but obviously times have changed, and in many respects, in a cost conscious modern navy a drone heavy air wing is probably going to be the right balance for us... (although separately perhaps not for the USA which needs to maintain a more credible *'threat'* to China and Russia).",0,1405284483,null,0,1405284769,0,ciwgt2a,t3_2akox7,t1_ciwgt2a,t1_ciw4h2f,null,1434698299,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

So basically nobody recognised him to our surprise and knowing what he's like on the pitch I was worried about bothering him.. I hesitantly ask ""hi Craig can we can a photo please?!"" He responses ""yeah ofcourse mate"" - we take the photo and he sits down and talks to me and my dad for a good 30 mins! After my dad showing off his Liverpool tattoo to him making it clear we were massive reds, Craig tells us how he is also a huge fan and still watched every game. After some more chit chat the last thing we say to him is we'd love to have him back at the club, he responds ""never say never, I'm in between Cardiff and City at the moment"".     


That all happens around late June, we came back to England late July and by that time, he'd already signed!! I like to think it was me who influenced his decision :p

It's reasonably new, so that might have been before this was set up.

&gt; Do you think this was under the deposit protection scheme?

I doubt it given the explanation, it should be very clear that it's in a scheme (you should get a leaflet and security details, etc from them). You and the landlord have to both agree to any deductions before money is released (and if you don't agree there has to be a free arbitration service). When was this?

There are loads of kids that grow up in broken or no homes, or are raised by the state. They're not taking Jimmy from the suburbs while his mum and dad are at work. 

Some ""male prostitute"" that is either homeless or has been with multiple foster families, never fitting in with any of them and always causing trouble, who is going to believe his story? Would the police take it seriously? Some random boys word against senior, respected politicians? Does the police have any evidence of the child being held underwater? They would just believe him to be a willing participant, and what rich toffs do in their own time is their own business, unless the officers wish to piss off their superiors. The press would not touch it for fear of libel lawsuits and the relationship that the press have with politicians. 

No one individual MP is going to have the evidence to blow the whistle, unless they were involved in the child abuse. It's all ""he said this"", ""this whip told me this"", nobody would take that accusation seriously. Clearly any MP that was involved in the child abuse would have no reason to go to the police about it. 

The power doesn't lie in the individual MP or in one civil servant, but with the leadership of the party, whips, communications team and the senior civil servants who wish to protect their reputation. It's a group with 1 common interest: cover up the hobby that many in Westminster are involved in. If an investigation gets launched and 10 people in the government get jailed for child abuse the political party in power is going to be kicked out at the next election. That simply isn't acceptable for anyone who wants to win and stay in power. There would also be a huge amount of scrutiny over senior civil servant positions as well, which would put a lot of noses out of joint.

Ultimately noone who knew stood to benefit from telling the authorities. It's not like with most scandals where someone has a political/ethical motive behind revealing the information, or evidence is left behind by the criminals. Shoot somebody dead and there's a body, covering that up is very difficult. Child abuse, what child abuse? No body, merely unreliable witnesses and victims.

There's a large number of misconceptions in this sentence about how UK universities work as opposed to US universities. The word ""concentration"" can be forgiven, but the concept is very much a US one and not a British one. In the UK generally, and especially in Cambridge, you don't get to choose to take a random course in Egyptian language, or underwater basket weaving, or whatever. If you study geography, you will just take courses in geography. If you study maths, you will just take courses in maths. There's an opportunity to change courses, but that's a fairly serious change and would require permission of the various directors of studies. For some courses, you will not even get much choice about options within your subject in the first year.

Plus, you don't get graded on individual classes, or on classes at all. All grading in based on your final exam, and there is one grade for the year.

There are no official curves, and it's certainly true that some subjects will grade very differently to others. In arts subjects, it's hard to get below a 2.ii, whereas in maths, typically 10% of students will get a 3rd (and some below that). In subjects with a lot of specialization (like sciences), some 3rd year courses will have &lt;20 students, and there will be a lot of variation between courses and between years of grading boundaries.

From that, my impression of the Management Studies course is that it's designed for people who got fed up of their chosen subject, and wanted to try something different for their final year.

What I *do* do, however, is criticise how mainstream and expected it seems to be now for unionists to be of the extreme-right-fucka-pope kind. The largest unionist party, DUP, have sold themselves out to the extreme-elements in our society - the Orange Order and the UVF/UDA (or at least people affiliated with those paramilitaries) are sitting at the table with them and telling them what they want. The largest unionist party dances to the tunes of the extreme right, and it tends to reflect badly of other mainstream unionist parties who feel they need to mimic the party that attracts the most votes.

I'm not anti-unionist in any way whatsoever, everyone is entitled to their own belief. I hoped with all my might that NI21 (then a unionist party) would make a breakthrough in the last elections, at the cost of the DUP/UUP/PUP... I'd even sacrifice a few thousand Sinn Féin votes if it meant moderate and non-corrupted unionism had a good voice throughout N. Ireland.

In short; the largest party in unionism is corrupted, and it reflects badly/gives a bad name to unionism.

true,collinsl02,null,null,"There was a video series produced in WW2 to educate US servicemen on their allies - one of the parts was on Britons and they put it something like this: 

""People in the UK are packed in like sardines in a can - the Germans and Japanese keep going on about ""Lebensraum and expansion"" but the Brits are packed in more densely than both of them and you don't hear them complaining. 

""People in the US build porches and stoops onto their houses so they don't miss the chance to talk with their neighbour who is passing by whom they might not catch if they didn't sit out and wait. In the UK they build high hedges surrounding their houses to insulate themselves from the world crowding in on them - a small bit of privacy in a cramped world.""

Or words to that effect. Because we are so packed in in the UK in general, and in London in particular, we learn from a very young age to keep as much to ourselves as possible. Otherwise we would constantly be treading on each other's toes (literally and not) and we would have massacred ourselves by now. So we try and keep to ourselves as much as possible, and part of that is keeping out of other people's business or not disturbing them unless we have to.

So you will see plenty of posts on subreddits like /r/britishproblems commenting on how the best we can manage when we disapprove strongly of another's actions (like stopping at the bottom of an escalator on the tube or standing on the left on the escalators or punching someone in the face) is to tut at them, or possibly, if we're in a bad mood, coughing in their general direction.

Arashi varies from good to appalling. Since yours isn't listed there, don't buy it. There are cheap helmets with 5* ratings.

Jacket - go for leather. Cow-hide, seven stitches per inch, and thick enough so that it bends rather than crumples. It's heavy, will make you sweat on a hot day, and will only keep the rain out for half an hour or so, but it's safe. Yes, there are some textile jackets that are as safe as leather, but they cost about £900 for the jacket alone. A back protector is nice, but your jacket is more important if you have to choose between the two. A padlock and chain is fine. 

Disc lock - this carries a risk that you will forget it, ride off, and bend a disc. If you get one, get one of those yellow warning cords that goes to the bars. Personally I would not use one.

Satnav - you might consider using Google Maps on your phone, with earpieces. Not as good as one with a display on the bars, but it does the job most of the time.

If we go then the EU will likely enter a downward financial spiral rather quickly, so they will likely do almost anything to keep us in.

We won't leave though - Cameron is sabre-rattling to try and win back hardline voters that are switching their vote to UKIP and other smaller parties. It's not a huge number of people moving away, but it might be enough for him to lose majorities on a lot of important seats which could cost him the next election.

The second reason he's sabre-rattling is because it's a nice little charade to hide some of the other stuff going on, and it makes it look as if the public is being given a say in ""important issues"". 

And the third reason is so Cameron can try and force the EU to reform itself into a more likeable image for the UK - he knows we are a key member and he thinks (rightly or wrongly) there need to be changes made. And because he doesn't like the next candidate for EU President he's using this as a chance to try and kick up a fuss to get things changed to the way he likes them, which should in theory benefit us Britons more, but in practice that's debatable. 

The real truth of the matter is that even if we get a referendum, and if that referendum says we should leave, someone somewhere will come up with a massive list of reasons why we can't leave or why it would be a terrible idea and nothing will happen.

Aye, they're going in the right direction... let's just read up a bit about him shall we:

*In January 1994, the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) released a document calling for ethnic cleansing and repartition, with the goal of making Northern Ireland wholly Protestant. The plan was to be implemented should the British Army withdraw from Northern Ireland. The vastly Catholic and nationalist areas would be handed over to the Republic of Ireland, and those left stranded in the ""Protestant state"" would be ""expelled, nullified, or interned"". Controversially, Wilson called some parts of the plan a ""very valuable return to reality"". He added: ""[it] shows that some loyalist paramilitaries are looking ahead and contemplating what needs to be done to maintain our separate Ulster identity"".*

*Wilson again served as Lord Mayor of Belfast between June 2000 and June 2001. During his time as Mayor, the Andersonstown News set-up a website to highlight Wilson's ""naked sectarianism"". The site included such quotes from Wilson as: ""The GAA is the sporting wing of the IRA""; ""I don't care if [gays] are ratepayers. As far as I am concerned they are perverts""; ""Taigs don't pay rates""; and ""They [Sinn Féin voters in the Oldpark area of Belfast] are sub-human animals"". The Andersonstown News had challenged Wilson to take legal action if he felt he was being misrepresented. He did not. The website voluntarily shut-down when he ended his tenure as Mayor.*

Different jackets will have different sized pockets for back protectors, so you may have to experiment. I wear a dainese jacket and protector, but these are probably a bit out of your budget unless you find a decent used one.

As for boots, as mentioned go for full ankle protection, they will also keep you drier, and offer actual protection. I bought my spada ones for £90, but they were a bit crap in the end.

**Goodwin Financial Services Ltd. (current account)** - NO.

Nothing about their products or services are particularly exciting or competitive, and anyone could find the same or better deal elsewhere in a few minutes with little effort.

Their customer service is mostly fine, but beware - all branch contact numbers pool to an Edinburgh call centre where everyone has Spanish accents (which is bizarre in itself), and all correspondence is centrally managed and logged.  This means getting hold of a named invididual in branch (even if they have left you a message asking you to call back) is impossible.

I discovered this when ""X"" from my local Edinburgh branch called me about an issue I'd raised and left ""his number"" which was the main branch phone number.  Call it up, get through to some Spaniard (who said he was based at South Gyle i.e. near their Group HQ in Edinburgh) who has *never* heard of X, asks me which branch I'm referring to then starts raking through the system... only to find X hadn't logged the call on the system and it hadn't officially happened.

This was how it was in 2012 and it was mighty bizarre, not sure if it's changed.

**The West Riding of Yorkshire Building Society (savings)** - NO, NO, NO, HELL NO, FUCK THAT

I originally signed up back in 2008, just before the crash, because they had the best rates on the market for both regular savings and ISAs.  I got one of each at 5.25% and 5.75% respectively - awesome.

Later, the BoE cuts the base rate.  This shower embarked on a race to the bottom, cutting their own rates more regularly and more drastically than everyone else until eventually it hit 1% on both of my accounts and has been there ever since.

I can't move money *between* my two accounts on the same web interface because I needed to fill out a special form.  How stupid - anyway, I'll just fill in the form, thought I.  Nope - two days after ""requesting"" the form (because you can't just download a PDF - they need to post you a blank form with nothing pre-populated), I got a barely literate and curt letter telling me I wasn't allowed to transfer money between my two accounts because of ""the terms and conditions"", which say nothing about this whatsoever.

Guess what?  I can *remove* money from both accounts to an external bank account, and simply pay it into the other one from outside.  There's also a big button to close the account and withdraw all money to a bank account of my choice.  But I can't transfer internally between two of *my* accounts at the same institution?  Absurd.

As a result of a move for work, my nearest branch is now 60 miles away.

8 stated that he was 1018, and that was before spending 600 years on planet Orbis.

Because they say they represent unionists. Other people don't question it. Usually because of their pro-authoritarian conditioning.  Person in power says something and it must be true...no questions. DUP/UUP represent unionists because they say so... don't ask questions. Even papers like the Belfast Telegraph just go with it. The worst case of that type of hurr durrr is with the prodastant coalition favorite... PUL. They claim to represent the PUL community.  People who want to demonize everything not catholic side will often use PUL community too.


There is a problem... people claim and state that ""unionists"" are this and ""unionism"" is that. Usually it is done to benefit themselves. Win protestant votes by claiming unionism is for prods. Defame unionism by stating that the OO represents unionist ideas etc... The truth. Unionism is only one idea. (NI part of the UK) There really isn't anything to hang around that idea except to protect it from Irish Nationalists. 

Never question the unionist cross branding. NEVER. 

* How are the OO parades unionist ?

* How is the DUP action on abortion unionist ?

* How is the 12th celebration unionist ?

* How is that racist unionist ?

Never ask. Fall in line. You are PUL or CNR exclusively. 

Answer to your question. People support/criticise so called ""unionists"" wrongly because of classification. They need to be called out for their idiocy. The DUP etc... have been allowed to get away with some really shit stuff because they hide behind the group they claim as ""unionist"". Only 17% of the population voted for all those ""unionist"" parties btw... (probably mostly out of habit or fear of others).

&gt;

&gt;___Invasion of the Dinosaurs___ is the second [serial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Doctor_Who_serials) of the [11th season](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_(season_11\)) of the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)*, which was first broadcast in six weekly parts from 12 January to 16 February 1974.

&gt;The Doctor and Sarah arrive in 1970s [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London) to find that the city has been evacuated, due to the mysterious appearance of [dinosaurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur). The monsters are being brought to the present by a disaffected scientist, using a [time machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel) nicknamed the Timescoop, as part of a plan to revert London to a utopian pre-technological age. The plan calls for Central London to be depopulated prior to being moved back through time, so that only an elite group (who will re-found the human race in the remote past, along more ethical lines) will make the trip. This plan, known as *Operation Golden Age*, is secretly being supported by key personnel within the British Government - and even within the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce, which is ostensibly combatting the menace.

&gt;This is the second serial to feature the journalist Sarah Jane Smith as the Doctor's travelling companion, and the penultimate appearance by UNIT regular Capt Mike Yates.

I read [Quincy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7K7WfjP7SM) and now I'm disappointed. 

I'm glad you've had a good hospital experience which is the polar opposite of my hospital admittance for a tonsillectomy when I was 18. It was so grim that I shan't even describe it. 

One thing I'd like to say in case the doctors already haven't or in case you have a performing monkey is that they DO serve a purpose. They're not just surplus shit sitting there for no evolutionary purpose we can think of. They're there to catch infections. After I had my tonsils removed, I had 8 years of ear, nose, throat and chest infections. I became so immune to antibiotics that I had to have six weeks of bastard strong ones to get rid of a chest infection when I was 26. They completely fucked my immune system, and I spent almost all of 18-26 either ill, or ill with severe thrush (yeah, thanks for that - not only am I sick but I can't get fucking laid without scratching my woman bits to pieces and passing it on to some poor, unsuspecting fella).

If they offer you a tonsillectomy, resist. It really fucks you up as an adult, unless you have a perfect lifestyle, which you don't with your boozing dear. 

NB: I am not a doctor.

PS: get well soon love.

PPS: are the drugs making you high? Cos that could be fun :)

It's not quite as simple as that. Fighting chronic illness (both mental and physical) is exhausting and many, many people reach a fuck-it point where they cut their losses. This happens with terminal illnesses; it certainly happens with non-terminal ones.

It is also the case with illnesses like depression that people let themselves get worse without taking stock of their situation. That's not choosing to be ill; but it is allowing oneself to become ill.

This proposal would help prevent both those issues.

Let's put it straight - when people say ""UNIONIST"" they think of:

- Fundamentalist Politicians
- Flag protesting, and other non-pragmatic, but vocal issues (parades etc)
- A history of gerrymandering and general 'lording over' Ulster by Unionist politicians
- A disconnection from the generally liberal and forward thinking 'mainland'

The issue is, that while Unionist means someone who wishes to be part of the Union, it is tainted by those in power who represent us and seem to carry on the negatives aspects of governing Unionism in the North as mentioned above.

I see you're looking at maybe the CBF125. On my CBF125 I was wearing the Alpinestars Fastlanes and I basically dropped the bike in a carpark. It's been nearly 2 years since and I can now walk and do most things like before. But I'm never going to be a runner like I used to be. The metal plate holding my foot together still sets off metal detectors though :P So my point is - even a 125 *is heavy* and your ankle is going to loose in any battle. *So get something decent.*

I learnt my lesson and wear [Sidi Adventure GoreTex](http://www.jsaccessories.co.uk/boots/touring/sidi-adventure-gore-black.html?). I got mine nearly new off ebay, much cheaper than new. I'm astonished how comfortable they are when walking off the bike. I keep them on for hours and never rush to take em off. I didn't fancy a racing style boot as I wasn't sure of the off bike comfort. 

The CBF125 sucks when if comes to sliders or crash bars (I wish I'd had some)

Have you read the [Honda Stunner](http://www.honda2wheelersindia.com/stunner/index.html) website for the bike in India? It's awesomely funny and sexist.

Hence the Bradbury (which I hadn't heard of before) was just a temporary circumvention of the gold standard to allow them to increase the money supply. Shortly after that, the UK came off the gold standard, and started printing more normal pound notes. It's exactly the same thing: if the spending power of a note is £1, it doesn't matter whether it's a pound sterling or a Bradbury, you're still increasing the money supply by the same amount.

We know what the problem is with this: print too many of them, and you get inflation, which is what happened in the 70's. The UK got up to about 20% inflation, but it can get much worse as was shown by inter-war Germany, and by Zimbabwe more recently.

BTW, I really don't trust the judgement of anyone who starts off by talking about the ""criminal activity"" of banks in using fractional reserve banking.

Your friend certainly knows how to draw faces and cloth well (the tie is quite nice), but needs to work on drawing what they see rather than what they think is there.

Jacket - I'll have to try them on and see what I feel the most comfortable in. I chose the textile one because I figured it should offer a reasonable amount of protection, if not the most, and the back armour should ensure that I don't end up paralysed. I will need some form of back armour though (for medical reasons) so it's only a question of whether I get dedicated armour or something integrated. 

Disc lock - that particular one is alarmed with a motion sensor, so it would trigger as soon as I took it off the kickstand. Figured I can do without a reminder cable on account of the alarm being a pretty good reminder. 

SatNav - I hadn't even thought of that one. I won't bother with a dedicated unit. I can easily pick up a mount for my phone and use a bluetooth headset. I rarely need SatNav anyway, so it's not a big deal. 

Now, the Chinese bike factor. I've been looking into them and it does seem to be very hit or miss. Either you get something that is an utter pile of crap, or you get something which works great and is fantastic value for money. Lexmoto seems to be on the better side of that scale from what I've been able to see, but getting it was on the assumption that 1) I couldn't get a CBF125 within my price range (which is dependant on how much I have left after buying gear), and 2) I want to get on a bike ASAP and I'm not willing to wait. However, that second assumption is no longer valid - after a discussion with my father, it seems that I'm going to have to put all of this on hold for a while, get a car, and then use that car to do everything I need to get myself a bike. What that means is that my progression plan has changed - I'll get my CBT now, but not actually get a bike until I turn 24, do my DAS for an A license, and go straight onto a mid size bike. 

So, I won't be getting a Chinese bike at all. ",0,1405297891,null,0,false,0,ciwmplp,t3_2alav1,t1_ciwmplp,t1_ciwilyk,null,1434701179,1,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,1

Better weather often means more tans and attractive people with less clothes and this automatically makes women seem more attractive. But even in places like Berlin that aren't warmer seem better, and I put this down to culture. People dress better and women use make up better there certainly. In Berlin ironically the ugly people often look English, because they mimic English/American fashion wearing crap like tracksuits, caps with flat peaks and fake Burberry. Most people understand it's not good to be plastered with brands, dress according to your body shape and attempt a more natural make up style there. I think the number of scummy people who don't get this really brings down the average, you'll always see overweight girls plastered with make up wearing revealing missfitting clothes on a Friday night here. It doesn't mean that people in these countries are any better mind you, just that dressing like an overgrown child with a fetish for sportswear is more taboo there.

I'm somewhat sceptical, if only because the DUP still have a bit of a problem where women are concerned. 

See a quote in this article:

&gt;Female councillor

&gt;“We can be truthful about this. There is no problem with women getting selected to stand, but there is an element of councillors that think that a women’s place is at home, and will remind you of that every so often — ‘What are you doing here? You should be at home washing the dishes’.”

I guess this may be a factor in why they're allegedly going to give 'party leader' to someone else.

If it happens, cool, it makes sense given she's temporarily been in the role already, and it's a possible step forward from an otherwise absurdly conservative party. I just hope we don't see a lot of sniping and snide comments about her, especially if she winds up being seen as a 'safe' target with the party leader being someone else.",0,1405302263,null,0,false,0,ciwoi3w,t3_2alolz,t1_ciwoi3w,t3_2alolz,null,1434702009,1,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,1
