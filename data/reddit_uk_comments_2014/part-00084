Aston Villa may be in mid-table in the Premier League, but keeper Brad Guzan may have played a major role in the title race.

true,SylvieK,lfc99,,"Such a tough question, because though it's cliched to say - this season more than any previous campaign and definitely more than any other squad, we have played as a unit, a team. 

If you just think of all the different schemes and formations Rodgers has deployed, they have for the most part, all come off beautifully and with a consistent style of play, no matter where individuals are deployed at that time. 

If I had to say, I think I've really appreciated Hendersen's intelligence this season. So amazing how in football, intelligence is a visible thing. Of course, I am astounded too by Coutinho's insightful and penetrating passes, and Sterling's speed. 

Sturridge has been outstanding. He was my man of the match in the Cardiff game, and such is our season that he wasn't the one with the hat-trick. I thought his movement inside the box, getting behind the defensive line, creating space and angles where there should only have been negative space was just amazing. 

Gerrard too has been deployed well this season in a deeper role. 

Defensively though we're not great, I think Skrtel and Cissokho have been pretty wonderful, though with inconsistent patches.

So in summary, I don't think there can be any singling out of another ""Player of the Season"". Of the team, Suarez deserves that mantle because his season has had two narratives - one of extreme personal redemption, and the other of finding professional success by having a team-first mentality. For that personal arc, and his astonishing, once-in-a-generation type form, he is truly deserving of every ""Of the Year/Season/Decade"" accolade. 

Beyond him and our oustanding collective, if there is another individual who deserves praise then it is Rodgers. I believe he is deserving of Manager of the Year awards at the end of the season. This campaign has all been part of Rodgers' master plan. To know the individual talents and egos, and to bring out in them the best of their individual gifts and inculcate a sense of a larger purpose - both a cohesive style of play, and a larger team goal beyond the self - is just amazing. You could learn a lot from the way he interacts with and manages his boys. 

Lovely stuff. Like me I'm sure you are all just so fucking grateful and proud of this group of Boys &amp; Men :)

Starting with UCL, because I obviously know more about it; UCL is the most prestigious on your list (generally considered as the third or fourth best in the country, and was recently ranked fourth in the world according to QS), and definitely has the best international reputation (it is the most internationally recognised uni in London, and has a very big foreign student population). It will get you good opportunities with companies and jobs, as more people overseas are familiar with it and London companies like London students. I also love it for lots of little reasons, teaching quality is great, very technologically based, lots of events (though not a big community feeling unless you put the effort in - a by-product of a 27,000 student body). Also the location is incredible, walking distance from the most amazing parts of London (Oxford Street, Soho, Westminster, Camden Market). As a city London is incredible, so many opportunities and places to go, and so much history, it's incomparable in Britain. However this comes at a cost of very high rent. I pay £159 per week in accommodation, which is alot more than you'll pay in either of the other two. Also drinking in bars and clubs is generally much more expensive (though we do have student unions that are cheaper, and everybody just pre-drinks cheap wine and vodka). 

Bristol is a great city for students, and the University is very prestigious (moreso than Southamton, less so than UCL). It's strong with sciences and you'll get good opportunities in whatever you are trying to do (probably, all subject to market conditions I guess). It will be cheaper to live there than London in terms of housing and nights out (the rest is about the same).

Southampton continues the trend, slightly less prestigious (but still well thought of, in the UK anyway, don't know about abroad). It's not a bad city, good nights out but there are rough areas I'm told. Travel is dirt cheap however. 

All of these Unis are part of the [Russell Group](http://www.russellgroup.ac.uk/our-universities/), the list of academically great UK universities (worth reading the profiles on that site for each), so they are all very good and none will let you down.

true,Huonym,null,null,"When you say ""interests rates,"" what I think you mean is the dollar : pound currency rate fluctuation.   Sure, that's strongly influenced by the interest rate but it's the currency rate that's the thing, as oil is priced in dollars.

And if we take the currency rate back as far as 1992, which is the best Oanda will give me and you get it here

http://www.oanda.com/currency/historical-rates/

We can see that, as I read it, the dollar has moved within a 17% band against the pound.   

So if we're talking about a commodity price that has varied from c. $20 a barrel in 1992 to $140 in 2008, the currency is pretty stable by comparison. 

One should also consider that the 2007 - 2008 spike in the Brent crude price was offset by extreme dollar weakness, so Scotland was probably paying nothing like as much in North Sea oil tax as it might like to think.

Sure, in the last three years we've had a relatively strong dollar coupled with a high oil price but that's only three years in the last 24/25.

I think oil is absolutely central to the Scottish economy and how much Scotland contributes to the UK.   That's why there is so much bitching about what those numbers are.

As for Scottish government numbers - why trust them?

You did not take the point I was making about RBS but I'm not surprised you lurched for your putative wallet at the mention - a very Scottish reflex.   

What I was on about with the reference to 2006 was not how much you would have to pay but that those numbers were just wrong.   

No hint of the storm that was to break in 2008 because they were just wrong, probably like the Scotch government numbers you linked to.

And of course there's a huge proportion of nationalists that favour an independent currency.

They haven't had sight of what might be something akin to the actualité, which is probably pretty disastrous, which is why Jock No. 1 knows he can afford nothing more than to bitch after the pound.  

As for how you vote, I very much hope it's for independence.

England, Wales and Northern Ireland will be leaner, fitter, faster and stronger without all this Scottish gurning.

Our Birmingham is similar: we almost became a byword for a bad-quality run-down city (think Detroit, but not anywhere near that bad) about ten years ago, but since then a huge programme of civic works has turned the city around. You may find the Birmingham Big City Plan (http://bigcityplan.birmingham.gov.uk) interesting, which explains that said huge programme of civic works is only really stage one of a whole set of planned effort to make Brum even more amazing. We've already got the Library of Birmingham (my thoughts are at http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2013/09/07/the-superb-palace-of-bookland-or-the-library-of-birmingham/ for more detail), the complete renovation of the mainline railway, and the whole canalside area (where I live) done, and there's lots more to come. This place is great. It will soon be amazing. 

So, what's Birmingham, AL like? I know nothing, except for generic prejudice about Alabama which I'm sure is wrong! I'd love to hear what's up and coming in our namesake. Speak on!

This is a typical Guardian bedroom blog. 

I see a way to make us all better off: give young people other options than university, after all we need SOME people to generate money rather than spend it on pumped up degrees. I wish I had never bothered wasting all those years at university frankly, and still meet friends who left school at 16, most of whom own large houses and employ a few people here and there- a noble way to give back a little. Don’t you think?

It is such a shame that lower/ middle class people have been brainwashed into believing that University holds the key to all the closed doors life thrwos up, enough so to reel up 45k in debt trying, even if most of it will never be paid back, any mug can see that this is a racket.  It makes us all look like fools, while the massive University-machine carries on gobbling the soul out of young, talented indivisuals.

And the lack of chemical weapons being used during WW2 (imagine if the Nazi's have used nerve agents, which they had, rather than conventional weapons during the Biltz) does point to a chance of nuclear nations going to war without using nuclear weapons. However, for the most part I would agree, nuclear weapons severely curtails the chance of direct, great power wars, as does global trade.

As for the BRIC nations, I think the most interesting development is China taking over Siberia. The Chinese have around 5 million expats in eastern Russia already, the Russians in that area are not overly enamored with Moscow, and there is a huge population imbalance between the two. Today this isn't a likely occurrence, but in 10-30 years when resource shortages are kicking in I can see this being a very important issue, especially if Russia has continued with it's current path of ""protecting Russians"".

•	Moyes took 4 points from them last season with a tie and a win with Everton and in the 11/12 season the two sides split 3 points each 

•	This all means that this game will result with Rooney scoring AT LEAST 3 goals with ZERO Mata assists (who will receive 2 yellow bookings) for United to win the game, meaning that the two Manchester sides will split 3 points each this season and to confirm that Moyes is the man for a top team next season

I recently went through the dispute service and they were very fair and even handed. They would not allow the landlord to charge you for the extra days. Also, the way it works, he will never be able to do this. TDS hold the deposit, not him, and they dish the money out according to how they decide it should be dished out. And their decision is final. So relax.

The dispute service has very good information on their website about how to make a claim, with examples. Follow that advice to the letter. Simply set out the claims, the counter claims and the evidence that support each side. Don't get personal. It's all about the evidence.

It's a great service and the best thing to have happened to renting in years.

So for example, my LL wanted to charge me £64 for replacing a lightbulb and £70 for cleaning. TDS reduced the lightbulb charge to £2 (just the cost of the lightbulb as professionals are not required to replace lightbulbs) and they cut the cleaning bill in half.

Strikers:
-Lukaku out
-Vellios Out, Seems to me if he hasnt had even a sniff so far this season he wont be getting a run.
-In at least one solid Striker that we can rely on for majority of our goals, could be Michy Batshuayi or a Bony  
-Lacina Troare Will come back on season long loan, Monaco Don't see him in first team yet, 
He stuck around even with this latest injury so it seems to me he might be sticking around for next season also, 
this will also help our money issues.
-Conor McAleny maybe to step up into some Europe/Cup games
-That gives us Kone, Troare, New guy, and McAleny up in striking position

Top three behind striker:
-Deulofeu will stay, he is far from ready to be in the Barca Team 
and I see no reason why he wouldn't stay, especially with the loan deal with the second season option.
-Left sided Winger, Peanuts is fading in his old age, Whether we use Oviedo in this position is also an option, 
especially with Baines so solid in LB. I would like to see Holtby come in, he seems class and has some Everton roots.


CM:
-Barry on a permanent
-Gibbo back from injury
-Need to bring in one more reliable CM so cover the busier fixture, so we can have at least 4 CM for rotation

Defenders:
-Fullbacks are ok Baines and Oviedo on the left, Coleman and Hibbo on the right
-Center Backs seem ok but with Distin and Jags getting on we can expect more soft tissue injury's etc
-Whether we fill these Gaps with Duffy and or Garbutt along with the already well performing Stones or Bring in a new CB will be interesting

Keeper:
-Howard is a boss and I don't see him losing his first team spot for another 2 seasons unless his form drops badly.
-Not sold on Joel, I think bobby will play him in the Cup and early Europe games and give him a chance to prove himself.

For all the talk about winning mentality and toughness in the squad, I doubt we could have had some of the performances we did without Gerrard. 

Arsenal are a great example of what talent without leadership looks like. Skrtel has been good, but this years credit goes to the attack that have covered our weak backline, it goes to the captain and the leaders for making is a fighting team and second only to Suarez it goes to the captain who gets the team to match his ambition. Watch the Fulham match again, it's the turning point of our season. The players have complete faith in him, they follow his lead and soon hopefully they will learn to be as driven as him.

His value to the team will become apparent when we go back to CL, watch how we play against bigger teams and the standard our leaders on the pitch set.

He is worth a look, but the negotiation will be a pain in the ass.

I honestly think there is a very good chance we will never see Benny for Spurs again. He was poor last season with us and then we sent him on loan. Despite the fact that we had a shortage at LB we still chose not to recall him. Add into that the rumors that not only did AVB not want to deal with him but Sherwood, Les, Freund and most of the front office didn't want him around.  We apparently tried very hard to sell him during the summer but 2 deals supposedly fell apart including one over a failed physical.  I think if Harry is still around at QPR they will take him on permanently.

If we bring in a front line LB option i think either Rose sticks around to fight for his slot or asks to be sold.  He has already stated he wants to start and would push for a move if he wasn't starting, so if we brought in someone like Sandro i think Rose would push for a move and we would stick with Zeki as an alternate.",0,1395707536,null,0,false,0,cgb1xew,t3_219s6l,t1_cgb1xew,t1_cgb18f7,null,1433053598,1,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,1

As far as getting in trouble, it's not the police you need worry about. They don't have a clue.
It's when you go belly up or get flattened by a car and the insurance company examines the bike. If you crashed without the restrictor installed you're not going to see a penny from them and could end up in court if the accident results in someone's injury.

true,devineman,null,null,"I'm quite unwilling to accept that Liverpool can bridge a revenue gap of £70m a year ""just because"".  

As I said numerous times, you don't have to just have commercial growth.  You have to match the commercial growth of all of the other Clubs AND exceed it by £70m to catch up.  
You have to do this whilst also spending money at the same rate as the other teams around you to keep up a sustained challenge of the CL places and now, unlike previous years, you're moving into the territory of competing directly with the high revenue Clubs for players that they also want so your talent pool will be more competitive.

You need to do this whilst turning around increasing losses over the past 3 years.  Then there's the looming threat of failing FFP, if not in the first Monitoring Period then the second one will create a big problem.  You lost £50m in the last accounts and spent another £50m in post balance sheet events on players if my memory serves.

As with many subjects, this is one of those things I'm absolutely willing to revisit in a year or two because time is going to be the great decider here.  I don't think the task at hand and the size of it that is being asked is really understood by fans at the moment.

FFP has completely fucked you.  As I said on a previous post I made about it, I don't really care as a City fan as we're inside the tent pissing out.  I do however think that the realities have just not hit people yet and in 18 months/2 years you will all be (correctly) screaming about how completely unfair and how much bullshit it is.  

You are talking about tunnel vision but nobody can seemingly tell me where this money is coming from and presume it will happen because ""we're Liverpool and we're a big Club"", like this is a magic cure to all of the problems in this scenario.  It isn't, you have to not just be in the CL but to sustain a place in the CL for those high value sponsorship deals to come in.  And you're going to have to do this whilst Manchester United will spend every penny they have to get back into the CL because THEIR revenue model and commercial income relies on sustained CL places.  All of the CL Clubs have this model.  You will need to displace people season on season who have greater spending power and absolutely have to stay in the CL.

Again, I'm not sure if some people just aren't looking at the reality of the situation here and presuming that because you're Liverpool everything will just work itself out.  I don't see where this spending power is going to come from and no team in the history of the Premier League has ever presented a sustained challenge to the CL places whilst having a lower squad spend.  You guys know your Club better than me, you tell me specifically where this money is coming from this summer.  Remember, you don't just have to have increases in revenue, you need to have increases that match and then exceed the increases in revenue that your competitors will have.

Yes, it's not fully yours until the end of the agreement (3 years in my case) but it's not as simple as they take it if you miss one payment... After paying 50% of it, it's difficult for them to take it off you.

LW: Grab someone to make Townsend step up his game. Jay Rodriguez would be cool. I think he's certainly better than Southampton but the top clubs in London(other than us) have LWs. Thorgan Hazard would be a long shot seeing as Chelsea probably want to make a Hazard-Oscar-Hazard Midfield, but I think he'd be a good player in our squad.  

ST:  As much as I love Adebayor's performance this year, there's absolutely no guarantee he even puts half the effort in next year. Soldado I think will emerge next year, but again, no guarantee. That leaves us to shore up some insurance. Realistic Purchases: Benteke or Dzeko. Dzeko has been told he can leave the club and I think he'd be a good front man for us. Benteke is too good for Aston Villa and I think he'd benefit from having a real team around him. Somewhat Realistic but also utopian signings: Mandzukic or Lukaku. It would come down to what Mandzukic wants to do, but I doubt he'll want to stay at a club where he will more than likely play 2nd Fiddle to Lewandowski. Also, since we're most likely to place 5th or 6th, Bayern might be more willing to sell to us as we won't be seeing them in the Champion's League. As for Lukaku: Mourinho has, in so many words, told everyone that he's going to sell Lukaku as he plans to purchase a top ST in the transfer window. We could try to get in their and snatch Lukaku.

Business Insider reports that Gates gave a talk at the American Enterprise Institute think tank in Washington, DC this week and said that both governments and businesses need to start preparing for a future where lots of people will be put out of work by software and robots.

“Software substitution, whether it’s for drivers or waiters or nurses… it’s progressing,” Gates said. “Technology over time will reduce demand for jobs, particularly at the lower end of skill set… 20 years from now, labor demand for lots of skill sets will be substantially lower. I don’t think people have that in their mental model.”

As for what governments should do to prevent social unrest in the wake of mass unemployment, the Microsoft cofounder said that they should basically get on their knees and beg businesses to keep employing humans over algorithms. This means perhaps eliminating payroll and corporate income taxes while also not raising the minimum wage so that businesses will feel comfortable employing people at dirt-cheap wages instead of outsourcing their jobs to an iPad.

They are the safe Tory seats that are supposed to be far removed from the high youth unemployment that plagues Britain's inner cities.
However, the number of young people out of work in rural areas and leafy parts of the Home Counties is now rising more quickly than anywhere else, according to official figures.
The Conservative strongholds of Winchester, Weston-Super-Mare and Devizes have all seen unemployment amongst 16 to 24 year-olds rise by at least 40 per cent over the past year.

Back onto the matter at hand, you're right of course but it's no different to you seeing people slagging off Liverpool for being owned by Russian terrorists.  It's wrong.  You automatically want to correct wrong ideas about your Club.

I'm pretty sure that as City didn't declare Etihad as a related party transaction (because, well, it's not a related party transaction), UEFA aren't even going to look at it.  We have two RPTs for them to look at from this seasons accounts which are suspected to be something to do with NYCFC and a currently unnamed project which might be something to do with the UFC if you believe the rumour mill.

I would have thought that if any fans in the world currently understood the idea of a new owner bringing in a new set of commercial contacts it would be Liverpool and all of their Boston based sponsors.  No different from bringing in an Abu Dhabi book of commercial contacts.

And I've never understood why people have ever thought the Etihad deal is ""a fix"" so to speak.  We get £20m a year for the shirt sponsorship.  That's the same as you and we're in the CL.  The problem is that everybody lumps together the Training Ground/Academy/Reserve stadium deal with the shirt deal and the stadium naming deal, adds it all up then declares it as ""our shirt sponsorship deal"" which I find not exactly fair.
What sort of a fix is it to give us the joint third biggest shirt sponsorship deal in the country?  That's a pretty stupid way to cheat.  It's not exactly like they tried to sneak it under the table here is it?

[Here is the same article today.  He did not reflect these changes anywhere](http://www.financialfairplay.co.uk/latest-news/will-city-pass-the-ffp-test-part-2-).

Here are some more quotes from him originally:

&gt;My projection has City failing the FFP test for the first Monitoring Period by £63.5m

&gt;If I had assumed a less successful season where City only reached the last 16 of the Champions League, did not win the FA Cup, City would be £32m worse off and would fail the FFP test by £95.5m.

These quotes can be found [here](http://web.archive.org/web/20120526061038/http://www.financialfairplay.co.uk/).  I'd like to point out that we had that ""less than successful season"" and indeed a much worse one so it stands to reason that his predictions of ""failing by £95.5m"" would be on the low end.

In [his latest post on City](http://www.financialfairplay.co.uk/latest-news/deloitte-s-rich-list-gives-sneak-preview-of-man-city-s-accounts) he states:


&gt; Manchester City appear to have been briefing journalists that they are on track to pass the FFP test. Assuming that is correct (and they are unlikely to be mistaken), by my calculations they need to find around £11.5m to nominally pass the test.

He's an analyst who was off by £80m in his prediction.

Not to toot by own horn or anything but my prediction [was off by £13m](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/wfooy/ffp_and_all_that/c5cxk82) the first year and was actually only almost bang on for the second season though I don't know how to search my posts for it properly.

A youngish striker.  I like Harry Kane a lot, but I think bringing in a striker who is closer to 20 than 30 would be good for us.  Ade is getting up there, and Soldado isn't young himself.  Someone like Benteke, but not as expensive or hyped.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;  you're moving into the territory of competing directly with the high revenue Clubs for players that they also want so your talent pool will be more competitive.


So we get to compete for players that we would otherwise have no chance of getting (without CL), how is that negative? We can still get the players we could get W/O CL, but we can now also get more players, thus the talent pool is more competitive for others and less for us. 

&gt;You need to do this whilst turning around increasing losses over the past 3 years. Then there's the looming threat of failing FFP, if not in the first Monitoring Period then the second one will create a big problem. 

Pure propaganda, City has a lot more to worry about than us and even they aren't under threat of FFP, if you have functioning academy and projects writing off double digit losses aren't as big deal as you think. Also 3 years of losses comes from writing off 40M failed stadium plans, firing multiple backroom staffs, paying players who lost their value to leave and also writing off player values. The outcome being a stable manager, stadium plans that are useful, players that are decently valued players, acceptable wages (100M less than you, which is a lot harder to decrease as we found out) and soon increased revenue.

Let me be generous and ignore all the deals that have been signed to increase our revenue by assuming every other club has increased equal amount. CL alone (if we get 3d, guaranteed group stages) should increase revenue by 25M, an increase in shirt sponsorship from CL appearance should be at minimum 5M (probably 10-15). 30M of your 70 covered with conservative estimate. Then the jump in league position from 8th to probably 3d would increase merit reward by ~5M. 35M directly from the rewards and competitions. In a year it won't be possible, at best I could see 20M increase in commercials by renewing the kit/sponsor deals, but even that would put us way under specially if you count in the yearly increases for all clubs.

So how do we cover this huge gap? By being clever with wage structure, whatever you do, for the next 2-3 years you will still have these huge contracts, that's 100M you spend more on keeping your players on the team sheet than we do, if we managed to cover the 70M, we would have 100M ""more"". to use elsewhere. Even assuming increase in contracts for our players, I doubt we will be doubling our wages any time soon.

The reason ""We're Liverpool"" is being repeated is simple, remove City from that list, you will see how the revenue from commercial is either decided by ""size"" or success and when it combines you have Man U. Spurs have had 4 years with a lot more success, yet in those 4 years we have increased our commercial to over twice theirs.

The problem with City fans, and I've met a few, is that they want to be ""big club"" yet want to talk as if they are the savior and model for small clubs. ""FFP is tyranny imposed by big clubs to stop smaller clubs from becoming successful and threatening them"", the thing is, if an asian billionaire decided he was going to buy a 5th div. club and get them to the first division and get top 4, it wouldn't represent this delusional sticking it to the big clubs scenario City fans imagine. In fact had it not been for City getting bankrolled, clubs that have been built on sweat and progress like Spurs, Everton, and NUFC would have gotten 4th place (albeit getting knocked by Chelsea). The fact that some guy decided to bless a club with his money doesn't make you heroes, it doesn't make your model any good, it doesn't represent David vs Goliath, you took the place many of these sides have been building towards.

------------------Fellaini----Fletch/Giggs------------

-----Januz/Kagawa------Mata--------Welb/Kagawa----

-------------------------Rooney--------------------

They have been changing tactics over their last few games so their game plan is hard to nail down. The combo of Kagawa and Mata gave them something a little different in their last game. They had more central penetration and less crosses. 

It'll be really interesting to see how Moyes approaches this. I've also been questioning if he'll concede the midfield and play a more defensive game (would see someone like Valencia come in). Wenger just got thumped trying to outgun Mourinho away. That's gotta be on his mind, even though he's at home. After two good results the last hing he'll want to do is throw away the good form. Not to mention the possibility of something similar to [that game from two years ago](http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/15421707)

However, an inform Mata and Kagawa supporting Rooney is a little scary. That could force Toure to be offensively withdrawn. Add to that a semi in form Negredo and our offence doesn't look as scary.

but, that doesn't mean we don't need players, cause we do. this is what i think.

**1) Left back** obviously. Rose just isn't good enough. he is a bottom half  PL player. nowhere near good enough for us, i don't care what anyone says. he just doesn't have the technical ability, crossing is shit, he jogs back when he makes a run forward. My first choice would be **Ricardo Rodriguez**. He is so good. Still so young yet he is so complete for a fullback. His crossing is some of the best i have for a fullback. I can't stress enough how much mroe dangerous we would be if we had a fullback like Rodriguez capable of brilliant crosses.

**2) Left wing**  Like many have said, **Konoplyanka** would be a brilliant addition. He ha splayed great against us twice now, as well as tearing England to shreds. He is quick, works hard, has good vision and can score/set up someone else. Players like Townsend/Lennon just doesn't have the technical ability, or the football IQ to be top wingers. Townsend i can forgive for now cause he is still young but Lennon is getting older now and he isn't improving anymore.

**3) Striker** I think we also need to bring in a young striker, different to what we have. **Michy Batshuayi** is a player i really like, and only 20. He's been killing it in the Belgian league and is jut another product of Belgium's golden generation. If not, i also like **Luc Castaignos** from Twente. Big body, only 21, and has a good record in the Dutch league so far.

i think they are three musts we do, but i also wouldn't mind the following

**Goalkeeper** Brad is going to be 43 come the season end. His contract is up, i don't think we will offer him a new one, so a young, new back up to Lloris will be needed as i don't think Archer will be good enough. It wouldn't surprise me if we bought a young, homegrown keeper from the lower leagues like that Nottingham keeper we've been linked with

**Centre back** This depends on Kaboul's fitness as well as Vertonghen's situation. If Vertonghen stays, and Kaboul can prove to stay fit, then perfect. However, i don't have faith Kaboul can stay fit. It's just been so long and i can see him breaking down again. If that is the case, then another CB is a must, as Dawson should not be starting for us anymore form next season on wards. Would love **Eric Dier** from Sporting. He is still only 20, but he is also English, adds to our home grown quota and has brilliant assets to be a top CB.

We used to have 40M interest payments in H&amp;G time, but that loan was also paid back as part of the buying bid for the club. 

My point was that Devineman shouldn't lump these 50M losses in with other sort of losses clubs like City experience, which is player amortization and wages. We will probably break even with the current revenue without transfers. 

Hodgson and Kenny were fired along with their staff, players who were brought in on big wages and inflated transfers were sold and their values written off, players were paid to leave, stadium loan was repaid, all of those added up to the huge losses we've experienced over the last 2 fiscal years. We will obviously have increase of 35M from PL media, 25M if we make it out of group stages in CL and that should put us in decent place, specially if Arsenal are our model for the next couple of seasons.

At striker, we do still have Naismith, who I imagine will stay in favor with Martinez until he becomes useless. While I'm not the biggest fan of the guy, he has proven a bit more this year than he did last year. If anything he could be useful as a bothersome striker we mainly use in Europe (should we get that far).

As for keepers, Howard's still the man, but I imagine Joel has opened up his spot for competition. Springthorpe could see some preseason action, as could any number of the young keepers we have in the U21 squad.

I imagine we max out on loans again next season, meaning we retain Deulofeu and hopefully Traore, so we've got room for another. Perhaps we could snag another out-of-favor CM that way (like we did Barry), or just boost wing depth.

What I'm wondering is who from the youth squad could make a legitimate run for first team minutes. Garbutt, Duffy and McAleny are definite possibilities, but who beyond that?

true,Drugba,MN,mongolia,"First of all, the FA was right to overturn the red. I'm stealing this from /r/soccer, but the laws of the game say:

&gt;A player is sent off, however, if he prevents a goal or an obvious goalscoring opportunity by deliberately handling the ball. This punishment arises not from the act of the player deliberately handling the ball but from the unacceptable and unfair intervention that prevented a goal being scored.

It's clear that intent doesn't matter. Doesn't matter why Chamberlin did it, the ball was going wide, so he wasn't preventing a goal scoring opportunity. It doesn't matter if you think that is right or wrong, the current rule is very clear.

I'd like to add, that in recent times we had a moderately similar rule save Cech from getting a red in the [FA Cup Semi Final against Tottenham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=xpBcMsacRUs#t=177). Cech flattened Adaboyer on a 1-on-1 without getting the ball (A clear red), but the loose ball rolled to Bale who put it into the empty net. Cech wasn't sent off because Bale had scored so an obvious goal scoring opportunity wasn't prevented.

It was a 6 year deal for £25M with great terms for the club in terms of other-than-kit merchandising and was well over the odds, to be honest.  I think Warrior saw it as a loss-leader as an entry point into the soccer/football kit market.  By comparison, City only get £12M from Nike and Arsenal just signed a deal for £30M from Puma, so by those standards, £25M plus control over non-kit merchandising is a pretty good deal for a club not even in the CL.

Again, by comparison, how do you explain the other £57.7M of our commercial deals that isn't coming from Warrior and Standard Chartered?  I doubt that you can and neither can I.  For all I know Henry's dog is sponsoring our official Liverpool Dog Treat for £10M per year.

The amount of individual errors we've been making lately makes me feel like passing the ball around our own half is suicide.  All it'll do is invite pressure on us, which we've not proven good at handling lately.  Liverpool have shown how vulnerable they can be at the back, so we need to exploit that.  They're going to score against us - at the very least twice I'd say - so we need to score more than them to win this game.

I think we need to be smart - play relatively deep and don't let our fullbacks go too high up the pitch (which we've done all season, and it's exposed the hell out of us).  Liverpool's runners will have a field day if Rose in particular stays high and wide on the left.

I'd play a fairly physical player up high, someone like Sandro or Dembele to act as a destroyer up the pitch, preventing Gerrard and Henderson from distributing too much.

Townsend on the left, Chadli on the right, Eriksen through the middle.  Bentaleb in the holding position, although Sandro will most likely feature there.

There was also an incident last year where I was sat at my computer. I could HEAR it squeezing through my window. I saw it claw its way down my wall and behind my desk, where it proceeded to scuttle about. At that point I was curled up on my chair with The Lord of The Rings book as my weapon. 

I made it my mission to stop it from annexing the room, so I spent roughly four hours timidly moving furniture and trying to crush it.

The ultimate aim will be to re-establish a wild population in the vicinity of Cadair Idris.

true,[deleted],null,null,"&gt;When you say ""interests rates,"" what I think you mean is the dollar : pound currency rate fluctuation.   Sure, that's strongly influenced by the interest rate but it's the currency rate that's the thing, as oil is priced in dollars.

&gt;And if we take the currency rate back as far as 1992, which is the best Oanda will give me and you get it here

&gt;http://www.oanda.com/currency/historical-rates/

&gt;We can see that, as I read it, the dollar has moved within a 17% band against the pound.   

&gt;So if we're talking about a commodity price that has varied from c. $20 a barrel in 1992 to $140 in 2008, the currency is pretty stable by comparison. 

&gt;One should also consider that the 2007 - 2008 spike in the Brent crude price was offset by extreme dollar weakness, so Scotland was probably paying nothing like as much in North Sea oil tax as it might like to think.

&gt;Sure, in the last three years we've had a relatively strong dollar coupled with a high oil price but that's only three years in the last 24/25.

&gt;I think oil is absolutely central to the Scottish economy and how much Scotland contributes to the UK.   That's why there is so much bitching about what those numbers are.

&gt;As for Scottish government numbers - why trust them?

&gt;You did not take the point I was making about RBS but I'm not surprised you lurched for your putative wallet at the mention - a very Scottish reflex.   

&gt;What I was on about with the reference to 2006 was not how much you would have to pay but that those numbers were just wrong.   

&gt;No hint of the storm that was to break in 2008 because they were just wrong, probably like the Scotch government numbers you linked to.

&gt;And of course there's a huge proportion of nationalists that favour an independent currency.

&gt;They haven't had sight of what might be something akin to the actualité, which is probably pretty disastrous, which is why Jock No. 1 knows he can afford nothing more than to bitch after the pound.  

&gt;As for how you vote, I very much hope it's for independence.

&gt;England, Wales and Northern Ireland will be leaner, fitter, faster and stronger without all this Scottish gurning.

&gt;

&gt;

No. The fluctuations between two currencies is not just what determines this value. Inflation rates in the pound compared to actual living costs is quite significant. Your technique has an insanely huge amount of variables and isn't necessary or used by any respected academic. Oil is still only a fifth of our tax revenue (which is still massive but means that it can't simply be considered alone).

Those are the GERS figures released by the UK treasury and are the figures used by the respected academic community. The Scottish Government doesn't have the ability to produce it's own numbers because it goes straight to the treasury and is paid back as pocket money. I linked them via the Scottish Government website (because in that particular data they meddled with the numbers to show their own figures) but the cold hard numbers are still there and you can find the same ones by putting it into google.

No matter who you ask it is simply the fact that Scotland has paid a higher percentage of tax compared to spending over the last thirty years apart from last year. When you find someone claiming otherwise it is generally because they have divided the oil per person and not using the UN maritime regulations which both sides agree on.

Sorry re RBS but it's something that people generally talk about incorrectly so I assumed it was a subtle hint about a failing bank with 'Scotland' in the name. (Again I'll reiterate that GERS figures are the accepted standard and those numbers weren't produced by the Scottish government).

One problem with GERS actually is that on issues like defence it does not have a complete breakdown per region on each sector but it shows that Scotland pays about £3 billion and sees £2 billion of that spent back in Scotland so there are areas where Scotland pays a sort of rent that wouldn't be required to be so high.

The treasury have no interest in making the Scottish figures look good and would probably take any opportunity to do otherwise.

Please do some actual reading about UK tax intake and research treasury papers.

I am driven more to independence everyday by the bigoted ignorant statements I hear on forums like this.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"I disagree about being better as a 4-2-3-1... I feel like nearly every time we've played with two CDMs, the ball gets bogged down between them and our back four, and we never transition the ball up the field quickly.  Quick transitions are the best way to play against Liverpool - they pour forward in numbers, and so every time the ball is won, we need to get forward quickly to hurt them before they regroup.  I don't have confidence in Sandro and Dembele being able to do that from deep.

Your point about Lennon is fair - his defensive workrate is huge.  I feel like he's not nearly incisive enough to start though.  Again, if we're trying to break upfield, his inability to find his man regularly with passes or crosses will only hurt us in the long run.

Chadli can start in the middle as an option, with Eriksen on the right or left if we are to play a double pivot.  I agree that Eriksen isn't best used pressing high up the pitch... Chadli is better suited to that.

My line up is attacking, but I feel like we need it.  We are way too open whether we play a two man CDM or not... I would much rather overcompensate for their weaknesses than our own.  There's no way we're holding them out for a whole match, so only scoring a single goal is not an option.  Southampton play in a way not too dissimilar to Liverpool, and we got drilled with Bentaleb and Moussa on the field.  We looked vastly better once Siggy came on at half time, because even though technically more vulnerable at the back, the ball hardly spent any time in our half.

As others have mentioned, we have lots of regional partnerships with energy drinks in Indonesia and Official Chinese Timekeeping Partners and the like but we have major incomes elsewhere.  BT sponsor City Square, City are a Youtube partner, Paddy Power are a big sponsor of ours.  The company that own Forex sponsor us [which led to a very fish out of water moment for Kompany](http://mcfc.forex.com/#trade-with-vincent) where he tells us that trading is ""just like"" playing football.  LG sponsor us for the screens and what have you, EA Sports sponsor us and we do lots of stuff in that area for FIFA and the like.  Viagogo are in there too as are those head camera people.  I seem to recall sponsorships with Jaguar and Amstel aswell

I think what many people forget though is that [City own all of their players image rights](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/ian-herbert-manchester-united-left-with-quandary-over-how-to-market-bad-guy-wayne-rooney-9150447.html) unlike other Clubs that only take a portion or take none of it.  Every player that signs for us has to agree to this and it's one of the reasons why we're willing to pay big wages.  This counts as commercial income for us.  So when Sergio Aguero appears in a Nike video advertising a new boot, they're paying City rather than Aguero.  That's a big earner for us and where lots of our commercial growth is expected to have come from.

You can actually see our accounts here:

http://content.mcfc.co.uk/~/media/Files/Annual%20Report/MCFC_AR.pdf

We release a sort of brochure rather than just a simple balance sheet and boast about every possible thing that anybody can think of.  Want to know what City's growth is as far as how often we're selected on FIFA games?  Accounts will tell you.  Want to know how many followers we have on Chinese Twitter clone Sina Weibo?  Accounts will tell you.  Want to know the proportion of home game attendees cam from within a 10 miles radius of the stadium?  Accounts will tell you.  Want to know how many hours of coaching our Under 10s team is getting every week?

It considered: ""Royal Mail is much less efficient and less profitable than its main European peers.""[23] It noted that ""The company was the least profitable postal company amongst its Western European peers, and the only one to make an operating loss.""[24]

&gt;23.  The review gave five reasons for this relative inefficiency. The   first four were as follows:

&gt;* the network mail centres and delivery offices, which had not been rationalised;

&gt;* the lack of automation in sorting and walk-sequencing;


&gt;* inefficient working practices;

&gt;* pay set above market rates, leading to a situation in which labour costs at Royal Mail Group were among the highest of European postal companies.

I think that comes from the perception that austerity seems to be targetted mainly at regions outside London, while big players in finance and service provision not only seem to be overlooked when it comes to making cuts, but are actually benefitting during this period of supposed belt-tightening.

It's possible to view HS2 as an extension of that, since there's a need for investment across every regional rail network, and yet we're talking about ploughing £40b of public money into a single infrastructure project that mainly benefits the London economy.

Based on your question, a UK Income Tax Return is likely not required.

If, however, you earned income while abroad that you brought into the UK, you may need to file a return. I don't mean an extra 100 euros, but if you earned a few grand and stuck it into a UK bank account, you need to let HMRC know.

Tax returns are required for a number of reasons, not just for the self employed as the general public believes. Returns are also required for:

*any capital gains

*if you are a director of a company

*if you have income from property exceeding £5k (ish)

*if you earn more than £100k

*if you have earnings from abroad that have been brought into the UK

*if you are a member/backer of Lloyds of London (shipping insurance)

As such, it is shocking, frankly disgusting, that the pilots homes were not immediately searched,  to attempt to find a motive.  The flight deck door is hard to get past without some form of co-operation, as whilst the crew normally have a fire axe, I doubt the rest of the flight would have let someone use it.

I don't like the word terrorist, but at the end of the day, what is it when a pilot say, [flies to Geneva to request asylum.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26222674) Myself I would say it was highjacking, but highjacking appears to be a kind of terrorism in modern press.

Sadly it may well transpire that this was another pilot suicide.

Given the fact the Malay authorities haven't acted properly on this line of inquiry, I think wild speculation of terrorism is sadly inevitable.  Combined with the fact that the flight recorders generally only store two hours of cockpit audio, we may well never know.  This is why I'm disappointed that more isn't being done in the *good old police enquiry and intelligence gathering* side of things, as I fear all the flight recorder will hold is details of George making a perfect glide into the sea.

&gt;Some of you may have noticed that I've always been quick to leap to Warrior's defence since they've been in football, and it's even been suspected I work for them in the past.

&gt;Well, in the interests of full disclosure, I've never worked for Warrior... but I did work for New Balance's UK PR agency until recently.

&gt;Although the two brands share a UK PR and Marketing team in-house, my work was for New Balance only, so a lot of my knowledge about Warrior's work is based largely on hearsay and a few throwaway comments from the team there, whilst also being granted a look at a few new Warrior products ahead of release when attending meetings in Warrington.

&gt;**What I would say is that I think there was a real understanding and acknowledgment from the UK team that some of its early work was a little wide of the mark of what might have been expected**. A big reason for this was the roll-out of the brand seemed to be led in America where Warrior is more of a 'rock'n'roll' youth brand, and they tried to adopt the same philosophy with football, whilst not fully understanding the cultural sensibilities of the game here. Again, this is largely borne from me reading between the lines, but I think it's acknowledged with the 'toned down' designs of the Stoke kits, and I'd expect to see the same with its other teams as and when the new strips are revealed.

&gt;My frequent defence of the Warrior brand comes from the fact that I absolutely fucking loved working for New Balance. Loved the brand, its culture, and the people I worked with there, and I guess I would often see criticism of Warrior as being a criticism of them, which they didn't deserve. 

&gt;What I do know is that I think there's a huge level of ambition for that brand to make an impact, and to really challenge the current market leaders with some really good quality product. Hopefully these new releases are a step in the right direction.

Inflation is a hard thing to accurately measure.  Myself if say prices for cigs went up to £50 a pack, I wouldn't be affected at all, yet some people would be massively.

So they try and create a 'basket' of things that the average consumer needs.  These include things like food, luxuries like flash memory and electronics, textiles and depending on the measure of inflation housing.

As such a drop in the price of fuel, will result in lower prices for many things, food prices are often driven not just by the price of labour, but by fuel costs too (shipping and production, farming is energy consuming).

This is what has mostly driven this drop in inflation.

It's interesting to see how labour have completely changed their tune about *cuts* and the like, now focusing on a *cost of living crisis* I say this, because most of the cost increases to my lifestyle happened before the conlibs came to power.

However, OPEC have announced that they are playing with production a bit, no doubt watching the relationship the 'West' has with Russia and rubbing their hands with glee.  This will unfortunately pressure thing again in a few months time.  As this current drop in inflation has been due almost entirely to these change in commodities, then it will be interesting to see what it is like come election time.

&gt;Each looks at the prices of hundreds of things we commonly spend money on, including bread, cinema tickets and pints of beer - and tracks how these prices have changed over time.

&gt;RPI includes housing costs such as mortgage interest payments and council tax, whereas CPI does not.

&gt;But that only accounts for a small part of the difference between RPI and CPI.

&gt;The main difference is caused by the fact that, although they use much of the same data, they calculate the inflation rate using different formulae.

&gt;The one CPI uses takes into account that when prices rise, some people will switch to lower priced alternatives. They will swap a higher priced brand of biscuits for a lower one, for example.

&gt;This results in a lower CPI reading than RPI in nearly all cases.

What has changed is what is included in that ""basket of goods"", which changes to reflect what people typically buy, for instance DVD players were recently removed.",0,1395743958,null,0,1395746005,0,cgbd1rm,t3_21b62u,t1_cgbd1rm,t1_cgbcyxv,null,1433058902,16,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,16

Thanks,  this is another question I needed to consider and you have covered it really well.

To be honest, it does not put me off.  Stupid as it may sound, I am not really planning to make any profit.  I am really just concerned that because I move all the time for work, everyone else will have jumped ahead of me in equity terms (partly from price rises and partly from actually having and paying off their mortgages).

So I won't say no to profit but I am more than happy to pay a little in cash terms to get the equity and to reduce the risk of being priced out of the market later on.

I guess I expect to do something like this (based on a 2 bed in Exeter):

Buy a place for ~160k on a 25 year mortgage with 20% down and 5% interest.  That is £750 a month.  £530 in interest and £220 in capital.

Rent it for about £800 (so just enough to cover mortgage plus a little).  Then I will pay (higher rate) tax on the £220 which will be about £88 a month.

Annually, that will be £1056 in tax for £2640 in equity.  I guess I would also need to set aside about a grand for other costs (redecorating, repairs, etc) and another for contingency?

**So if I bought the place and lived in it, I would avoid £88 a month in tax but since I can't, that seems like a small price to pay to gain £140 in equity and not have to worry as much about rising prices.**

Of course, there will be periods when it's empty and I will need to be sure I can meet the mortgage then but at the moment I pay £600 in rent and I save another £800 a month so I think I could meet the mortgage with zero problems...

A good example is Eden Hazard's red card after ""kicking"" the Swansea ball boy, even though the replays make it quite clear that there was no kick, and no contact with the ball boy the FA did not overrule the decision because the straight red was the correct penalty for what the ref judged to be violent conduct, even if his judgement was incorrect.

 [**Park the bus (football term)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park%20the%20bus%20(football%20term\)): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;To __Park the bus__ in [association football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) refers to a defensive style of play whereby a team attempts to restrict the opposition by playing many players behind the ball with limited or no attacking play. Such a style of play is known for making it very difficult for the opposition to score. The term can be considered pejorative and has negative connotations of being a boring and unattractive style of play, however effective it may be. One example of this style of play is the [Greek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece_national_football_team) campaign in [UEFA Euro 2004](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2004), in which they won whilst scoring an average of 1.17 goals per game, [the lowest average in the tournament's history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UEFA_European_Championship_records).

One example of many is the subscriber system. For a user it's bloody awful - You don't get to see all your subscriptions, they are posted in a horizontal scroll bar (WHY) and YouTube is more concerned about you seeing popular Youtubers likes/favs than the customised content you wanted.

For an uploader, it's sheer hell. Your post will not reach all your subscribers (""that's what paying for boosting is for!!!""), times by the one-strike coypright infringement system (that has recently been improved, but for a long time was useless) and constant issues with upload, framerate and so on.

This was never the case in the old YouTube, it really wasn't, and that's partly because it was so much smaller. 

Put it another way. Two weeks ago YouTube went down for the day, and we got nothing NOTHING from the site to explain. Just the error page and a global outcry of confusion. Once it went down in August 2006 for two hours and I got three emails from the YouTube staff apologising and updating us on how it's going. The difference is staggering.

The Google+ community (all 10 of them) might be nice guys, but it does not compare with the old YouTube community. Vloggers and LPers have noted a huge change in both the content being uploaded (""LIKES AND FAVS"" plus the endless want to 'make it big') and the comments (just read the fucking comments now. Disgraceful.) going downhill. That anonymity you talk about is not true - So many non-linked G+ accounts - Read PewDiePie's comments and feel your eyes bleed.

YouTube in 2006 was magical because it never could work; no-one was trying to make money, no-one was forcing any third-party model into the system, and it wasn't even that popular - So a tight band of people worked together for the love of creation to a smaller audience. No need to pander to the lowest common denominator and no need to force unneccesary redesigns to excuse your expensive purchase. You say ""more and more videos keep being added"" - That's almost the damn problem; it's all about quantity and not quality.

Peter Oakley did so well because that community was kind to him. If he started uploading today I genuinely think he'd have gotten none of the views he deserves, and that makes me so damn sad.

Second, we tried to catch Mou off guard and limit Hazard's impact, a mental error still almost made it a moot point, but against LFC we have now showed this strategy so Rodgers knows its a possibility and  Suarez/Sturridge move around nearly constantly so trying to isolate a flank becomes less effective.

The Champions league was such a magical series of games. So many individual games, culminating in the greatest champions league final of all time, that were absolute classics. The sheer intensity of the night can't be topped in my opinion.

Winning the league would be a better achievement because of what it means to the club going forward.

This includes the Chelsea game where our attacking play was almost non-existent. I can see why a team would want to cross the ball at times, as that would widen the opponents back line leaving bigger gaps for second row attackers to get into. However the stats here show that we are not very successful at crossing the ball. None of the 12 goals in the past 5 games has come from a cross.

So when I criticise Sherwood for not having a plan, I'm in the wrong. It would just seem that he's betting on the wrong horse.
 
To summarize the stats, in the past five games we've crossed the ball (including corners) 123 times, we've completed the cross 24 times, and 11 times it lead to a shot. No assists.
 
So 19.5% of our crosses are completed and 45.8% of our completed crosses lead to a shot. This means that 8.9% of our crosses leads to a shot.

No shit. If you are rich + anything its better than just being anything. No one telling you that should ever be shocking.

Do you really think getting a cash sum in your 50's affects equality of opportunity? Of course its better to be hard-working and have money, but if you are talking solely about inheritance, the vast majority of the population are already long past the point where money affects their opportunities by the time they get it.

When you look in terms of success of teams, you can almost throw United and Arsenal out because Wenger and SAF are huge outliers (as is Moyes at Everton) to management longevity not only in England but really in Europe as a whole.

Just look at the longest tenured managers in England (from PL down to league 2):

Arsene Wenger - Arsenal - 18 Seasons

Paul Tisdale - Exeter City - 8 Seasons

Mark Yates - Cheltenham Town - 5 Seasons

Russell Slade - Leyton Orient - 4 Seasons

Karl Robinson - MK Dons - 4 Seasons

Alan Pardew - NUFC - 4 Season

The next longest tenured manager in the PL is Big Sam over at West Ham...and he is 12th with 3 seasons.

4 Seasons is now ""long-term"" in England for a manager...yes we change managers frequently, but so does the rest of England and most of Europe, think about the stability of the ""Big Boys"" around Europe (Real, Barca, Bayern, Inter, AC, PSG), all the management posts are effectively revolving doors through ownership decision or managers deciding to move on. 

Maybe our issue isn't that we change managers frequently, but the fact that we choose our management postings very poorly?

I have a picture on my phone of some graffiti that appeared overnight on the wall of some maisonettes at the top of my road last year. It said ""[Child Molester](http://imgur.com/NYPOgAG)"" and a flat number.

When we moved in, 15 years ago, we made friends with the neighbours, as you do. We then discovered one neighbour was a complete psycho, like certifiable, had spent time in the nuthouse, psycho. Her kids were suicidal and out of control. We endured months of ""knock &amp; run"" and when we did something about it (blindly throwing water over the 6ft hedge outside our front door to drench and deter the anonymous idiots) we had the psycho mother storm round and scream about ""was I a paedo for enjoying covering her daughter in water?"". Um, if your daughter hadn't been there, she wouldn't have been caught by a blindly thrown bucket of water, would she? 

She knew some very dodgy people. She had us burgled and spread disgusting rumours about us to everyone who would listen, and probably plenty who wouldn't, including the people who replaced their neighbours and the people who moved in after them. It's only in the last couple of years, people further away than our immediate neighbours have begun talking to us. Shit sticks if you fling enough of it.

Has it ever occurred to you that when England play football against Germany the pubs of Glasgow are full of people in German shirts not because of some genetic imperative or ethnic impulse but because they choose it.

My view is that the Scots are selfish and greedy not because of some racial determinism but because they choose to be. 

Look at the UK inflation rate from 1992, which you can find here,

http://www.tradingeconomics.com/united-kingdom/inflation-cpi

You can see it's remained within a pretty narrow band of 1% - 3% except for spikes in 2011 and 2009 and an early start at maybe 7% in 1992 itself and maybe early 1993.

For about 18 of the 22/23 years, more than 75%, its been pretty stable and the spikes were as of nothing compared to the serious inflation of the 1970's. 

To say that variable has had a ""quite significant"" impact on the tax revenue of a commodity that's varied from $20.00 to $140.00, or some 700%, looks just plain wrong to me.

As for your suggestion that the ""treasury have no interest in making the Scottish figures look good,"" that's just plain wrong too because the ""pitch"" has always been, ""we're one big happy family cooperating for the mutual benefit.""

What I think they've gone and done is just choose the numbers they want, added them up and come to the answer they want - one big happy family.

It's not as if anyone has even thought about putting a money number on the value of Scotland's seamless access to British capital networks or British intellectual, cultural or diplomatic resources.

But lets just take you Scot Gov/Treasury numbers and look at 2006/2007.   They tell me that per capita the Scots paid £1,282 more in tax than other people in the UK.

And in the little table beneath the fifth paragraph of the ""Proportional to population"" section of 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_formula

We get that in 2006/2007 per person the Scots received £8,623, the English £7,121.  That's a difference of £1,502.

If we take the £1,282 alleged extra in tax the Scots pay away from $1,502 the Scots received, every man woman and child of them, got £220 more than they paid or well over £1 billion if we multiply £220 by the c. 5,295,000 Scots population. 

And that's in a year when the Scottish numbers say the tax receipt difference was £1,282.   I wonder how much more the Scots got in 1999/2000 when the supposed tax receipt difference was only £198?

And you started our little aside here with, 

""Well that's bullshit.""

Pah!

Even on your own numbers, you're just plain wrong.

Some people may wish to study for the sake of it, some do not. While i have no issue with the people who study for the sake of it, indeed the majority of my friends who studied physics with me have gone on to their PhD's in further physics, and one dirty chemist. Two in high energy particle physics and one into astro and another in magnetic resonance. 

Only two of us moved onto jobs in our group of friends and that is myself and a friend who went into medical physics.

My issue with those courses arises when a student graduates and then expects there to be a job for them, by dint of doing a degree that there should be an appropriate job available for them when they finish university. 

Myself i did my degree so that i have something that is valuable in the economic world. It allows me to earn lots of money and i have plenty of prospects should i wish to move around during my career. This is the exact reason i did my degree. Sure it was interesting too, but i wanted the money and financial security at the end of it. It's wha i like. This money has let me pay off my loan for my masters already. I can comfortably afford a 2 bedroomed flat by myself and i still have a ludicrous amount of disposable income.

My annoyance comes from when i discuss how things are going with my humanities graduate friends and they seem outraged that i can manage all of this when some of them are still struggling to find jobs.

Sure study for the sake of it, but do not complain once you have graduated and are surprised that you are struggling to find a high paying job with excellent mobility options throughout your career.

Also I did say missed payments, not just one, pretty sure no finance company would go through the hassle of repossession for one missed payment, it'd just be a black mark on your credit rating. Of course, it's always best to try and come to a resolution before you miss a payment with the finance company anyway, they prefer to come to a resolution than repossess.

As for APR, I was rounding it up to easy maths, and given they would depend considerably on your credit rating they're mostly irrelevant, the point is that a credit card would be more expensive in all situations so there would be some small risk in using savings that might be needed later.

&gt; So don't be scared of finance

This is a good point but I think it's important to remember that missed payments can damage your credit rating even if you don't lose your bike. Damaged credit ratings can affect things like mortgages, and you'd save a *lot* more on even a slightly favourable mortgage rate.

Their expectation is not their own fault - but I must agree that there is a measure of wilful ignorance there too.  This is not an expectation to be encouraged, but does come as part of the package when you start selling degrees as product.  e.g. Buy this car - it'll make you look and feel like this model man.  Take this degree course, it will set you in god stead for the rest of your life.  This sort of advertisement plays on the trusting nature of being young (can callously be read as; stupid) - which is a shame.

&gt;Myself i did my degree so that i have something that is valuable in the economic world.

That's fine.  I went the other way.  I chose a degree that would be built into the very person I am.  I decided I was not willing to spend years and years of my life doing things that never would have occurred to me to do had money never been involved.  I decided to do what I wanted, not what I *should* do to ensure economic security.  Both options were open to me, I could have done whatever I wanted.  

&gt;Sure study for the sake of it, but do not complain once you have graduated and are surprised that you are struggling to find a high paying job with excellent mobility options throughout your career.

I'm not, and I don't.  I'm not sure why you're lecturing me.  I'm do not believe I will ever regret my degree decision.  Your opinion seems to be quite sweeping and derogatory to anyone that made different choices to you.  Pretty typical of a stem4lyfe kind of guy from what I've seen.  They tend to be ruthlessly logical, forgetting sometimes that they are not made of metal, or career driven from their early teens - which always makes me a little suspicious.  

&gt;Also what the hell degree teaches you in specific software? Because it isnt a degree.

I was simplifying in order to make more compact a point that could span an entire book.  I assumed you would have been able to catch on, should have clarified but it was already getting a bit long.


Anyway - all that aside.  My point was that university education has never been a hub for training multitudes of workers so they can labour effectively under the assembly line technique,  and it's a damn shame that now it is such a deeply embedded perspective of what a university is supposed to be doing in the modern day.

FTFY

It's worthwhile ringing up the HR dept and ask for reasons, they can be really helpful.  There may be skills that you thought were implicit on your application, for example, but if they're sifting on keywords, you could have missed out because you didn't use the specific word, or there could be skills you're lacking that you could get yourself up to speed on easily.

YOU are good enough, but you didn't look like the best prepared for the job. So look at the person specs again, look at your application again, and look at yourself.  Find areas you can improve and try again.

My favourite quote:

""Ever tried. Ever failed.  No matter.  Try again. Fail again. Fail better.""

Keep going and only let your last application enter your mind as a possible hint for how to get the next one.  Easier said than done, I know, but good luck, anyway. :)

Yes, some journalists will be driven enough by passion that they will keep writing their stuff even if they have to do it for free with another job on the side. But that's not going to yield a healthy journalistic environment with the critical and investigative reporting a democracy needs to keep functioning. 

""It's up to them to find a way to make money on it""; ""it's up to those journalists to ensure their work gets out somehow""; actually, I would argue that it's up to all of us to ensure that quality journalism remains a feasible profession, if we don't want to lose it altogether.

If we refuse to pay for it, one way or another, it will probably die - it's pretty simple. I'm not being sanctimonious or anything, I'm as guilty as anyone. It's almost always possible find a free alternative to any article that's behind a pay wall - and if there isn't, there's free quality reporting about another subject to start reading instead. I do it too ... but still, we'll have to pay the price if we keep refusing to pay for good journalistic work in some way or other, and that's that there will be less of it. 

There already is - but we can still compensate for it by broadening our scope to media from further away; if there are only three good Dutch newspapers left, for example, a Dutchman can compensate by starting to read American or German media. But that's not going to work forever. In local news, already, holes are starting to form where things are just not reported anymore because nobody's being paid to do so, and the only ones who are willing to do it for free are often blogging cranks or those promoting their own political pet cause.

Of course there are alternatives - you said somewhere above that it's a good thing the BBC's news can go its own way without too much pandering thanks to all the Brits having to pay their license fee. That's one way, I guess - some kind of tax-funded compensation for journalism. But that still involves us, as news consumers, becoming willing to pay for it. (Also, there's endless questions: who would supervise the funding, who'd decide what journalism qualifies?). Another option more and more online journalistic media turn to is seeking grants from the philanthropic funders of the world, the Soroses and so forth. Which has its own ethical dilemmas.

I mean, in the end, if we want to keep some kind of quality journalism and investigative reporting, we too, as news consumers, have a stake in finding or creating alternatives, even if it's just paying for the occasional access to a quality piece. It's only all up to the journalists themselves to find a solution, like you say, if you don't care how much quality journalism we'll end up with anyway.

But they don't. This is the problem more than the tactic. Players not getting their heads up in around the box and finding the right ball. This is why Chadli has grown on me recently.

However, when you consider the potential upside a player like Shaw provides, that price tag doesn’t look too daunting.  Assume Shaw remains a good option until he’s 32 years old, amortize 25 million over 14 years, and it’s less than 2m per season.  Dani Alves cost Barcelona over 30 million euros in 2008, but few would contend that he’s been well worth it given his immense contribution to a team that has won all there is to win.  Similarly, Chelsea would gladly go back in time and pursue Ashley Cole with the same (if not more) vigor.  Cole has been a dominant left-back for almost a decade at Stamford Bridge, and his value has outweighed the financial outlay it took to get his signature (Cole was quoted at 25 million pounds by Arsenal, Chelsea offered 16, but the clubs eventually settled on 5m plus William Gallas).  Shaw’s potential impact should be viewed in the same light.  All signs point to Shaw being the type of player that could tie down the left-back role for over a decade and help LFC win a good number of trophies.  25 million could probably buy us a player who helps win more points next season, but few 25 million pound players have Shaw’s capacity for long-term returns.

Accounts for the 2012/13 season exposed an overall debt figure over £170 million pounds. Chairman Fernandes has dispatched PR releases through his preferred channels, but this has done little to soothe concerned minds, disturbed that a club commanding matchday crowds of around 16,000 souls could rack up such an extraordinary figure so swiftly. The spectre of an FFP transfer embargo embargo or a colossal fine is also discernible on the horizon.

On the pitch, casualty numbers have been such that one wonders if Jose Bosingwa is holed up in an Anatolian cave with voodoo dolls in blue and white shirts lined up before his maniacal grimace. Firepower has once again been lacking, as Kevin Doyle and Andy Johnson  succumbed to their wounds, leaving an unappetising choice of Will Keane, Modibo Maiga and Bobby Zamora left in the toolbox. Assou-Ekotto's drop-off in form has been mysteriously accompanied by an injury keeping him out of the squad, and a resurgent Jenas and Traoré were also cruelly snatched away from the Superhoops in their hour of need.

Two positive results against whipping boys Birmingham City and Yeovil Town did little to convince the QPR faithful that the squad taking to the pitch week in week out had the necessary ingredients to either entertain or obtain the elusive top two finish - heartbreaking midweek losses against Brighton and Sheffield Wednesday torpedoed supporters' morale and had a few speculative tabloid vultures circling over Redknapp's head.

There is always, of course, the odd ray of hope. Richard Dunne's red card for a desperate foul on the last man at Hillsborough meant that Hill was no longer available to cover left back due to central defensive duties. Enter Yun Suk-young, a youngster contracted to QPR through to 2016 with an Olympic bronze medal to his name. Pace, workrate, tenacious defending - at last after weeks of Assou-Ekotto's indifference the QPR support had some effort to cheer at the leftback position. Ravel Morrison, welcomed by some with a grimace for being the 8th loan signing in a season, appeared to answer the prayers of those lamenting the loss of Austin and his goal scoring record. At Middlesborough, a bottle cap perhaps discarded in that very spot by Christ himself mystically guided the ball to a sprinting Zamora to gift us three points out of nowhere. Statistics provided by acolyte /u/UltraPleb indicate a playoff position is all but secured, and champion bricklayer Charlie Austin should be available in that push to Wembley.

We too have that dirty industrial image that we've overcome a great deal.  Birmingham began as a hotbed of coal, iron, steel.  That vast supply spurred lots of manufacturing.  Now, though, it's really a secondary blight.  Our primary blight occurred during the civil rights movements when racism had a strong foothold, and our city became the focal point of that civil rights movement in National news.  I've been raised not to recognize race since elementary school, and so have my friends.  We've been raised to accept people of all kinds, and we're probably more sensitive to other people being racist than most other cities/states because of that unfortunate history.  We're still easy targets for stand-up comedy, but like you, I live in a beautiful city that doesn't have much tourism, so it's kind of OUR secret garden.

Over several PL seasons, it's clear that crosses produce shots at a very low rate; and, although the shots taken from crosses are at times from good areas (like the six yard box), they convert to goals at a much lower rate than shots from through balls. 

Crosses in his studies emerge as a kind cheap, low percentage form of offense. You can send crosses in all day long and not generate much; see some of United's game earlier this season. Their redeeming character, such as it is, is that it's relatively easy to generate offense from crosses, but I think that'a largely a function of defenses preferring to give up crosses. Statistically, a defense is much better off protecting the middle of the pitch and the penalty area, and forcing attackers wide, into relatively less dangerous crossing attacks. 

Crosses of course have their use, because if you can spread the attack and if you make yourself a threat in that way, you can open up space in the middle where the high-percentage chances come from. They shouldn't be the main part of an attack, however, and I would read an emphasis on crosses as a failure to break down defenses in the middle.",0,1395759428,null,0,false,0,cgbhcex,t3_21bcha,t1_cgbhcex,t1_cgbe5ck,null,1433060994,3,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,3

Kroos/Xavi/Modric focus more on establishing and holding an offensive move and create chances for others, you don't see them busting a gut to track down the opposition when they counter like Ramires does. Our wingers and the ""number 10"" create chances while Ramires provides safety in case of a counter attack (and sometimes he joines attacking when allowed to and when it's possible).

They are not supposed to deduct any more than 50%, regardless of what tax code lands on their desk. A manual check should have prevented this (and yes, this is in the Employers handbook from HMRC). You can ask them to reprocess the payroll using BR(W1) which will still probably deduct too much tax, but not as much as they already did.

Without knowing all your circumstances, I cannot say what your tax codes should be, but D0 sounds wrong. It implies that at your other jobs you are earning enough to put you into Higher Rate. However, it sounds like HMRC may have inverted your codes (happens ALL THE TIME!!!).

HMRC were right about the P60, though. They will fix it once you get that in. Make sure you keep a copy, they have a tendency to get lost in the system.

You also need to get P45s from all of the jobs you have left that have not provided one, and do it now. Not next week, now. You need these before the end of the tax year so that you can close off those employments without waiting for a P60 (can take up to 2 months for this, btw)

Also, request a list of all known employers from HMRC. Your NINO may have been linked to another person in error.

Yours is not a unique case, but due to the complexity may take time to fix via HMRC (approx 12 weeks from when you submit all the info). You should speak to your employer as a priority.

**EDIT tl;dr** Speak to employer, reprocess pay, fix with HMRC later

Given how sporadically he was played, you might have legitimately thought these were flukes, if you didn't know the player. But Rodgers knew Sturridge from his time at Chelsea, and I suspect he also knew what Sturridge could do if he was given the right support.

The first is what the woman at HMRC said to me - I said this to the payroll manager, she just said it was an automated process. Did kind of seem wrong to me.

I basically earn little more than minimum wage, and mostly only had 1 job at a time this past year, except for Nov-Jan when I had two, but was only working about 50 hours a week in total, and earning £6.31 p/hr at one job and about £6.90 p/hr at the other, so no way have I ever been earning enough to put me in the higher tax rate. All other times I was earning the same and never working more than 48 hours a week, so was taking home about £1000 each month, usually a bit less.

I've got all of my P45s from my previous jobs sitting here with me, is there something I should do with them now? Or do I have to wait until I get my P60? Any time I contact HMRC they have told me I don't have to notify them that I have stopped working somewhere - that the employer will let them know. And I'm spending money I don't have to have ridiculous conversations with their advisors while spending most of my time on hold - it's £5 for a phonecall lasting about 15 minutes.

I just cannot afford at all to not be paid for the work I've done. Effectively I've been paid less than £1 an hour for my previous month's work - I have bills and shit! 

My actual manager is lovely but really doesn't have any idea what it means. The payroll manager has been helpful, but seems to be suggesting she's basically helpless until HMRC send a new code - she just keeps saying things like 'oh they are naughty'.",0,1395760437,null,0,false,0,cgbhruf,t3_21bpc8,t1_cgbhruf,t1_cgbhfdz,null,1433061197,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Also, stop calling the 08/03 numbers, call the international number on the website, charged as a national call in the UK and included in any minutes bundle you may have (and cheaper on PAYG)

From your summary there, and the fact you have P45s from previous jobs, you can get this fixed, but it's going to take a while.

Add up all the amounts of pay and tax from your P45s (ignore NICs, you can kiss them goodbye). Add to these the pay and tax from your latest payslip. Your tax should be 20% of everything over £9440

If you have paid more, you will (eventually) get it back. This is best done by writing to HMRC with copies of P60/P45s. If they need the originals, they'll ask for them. It's best to write as the folks in the call centres are limited on what they can do (they used to be able to do more).

We then have guys like Eriksen, Chadli, and Lamela who can play as a 10.  We have two or three guys who can be the 6, and two or three who can play the 10.

Look at our options for the 8.  Mousa and Paulinho.  Neither are great passers.  Paulinho is a good runner who gets into good positions further up the pitch, and is decent defensively.  Mousa a brilliant dribbler who doesn't provide much in the way of creativity, and also slows the game down.

Our other options are Gylfi and Holtby.  Holtby is a high energy player who plays quick, but I'm not sure if he's the playmaker we're looking for, but he plays at a higher speed than Mousa and Pauly.  He is a better passer in my opinion, but I'm not sure if he's quite on the level we need.  Sig is more suited to playing further up the pitch, though he's played well in his last two matches in a deeper role.

Source? Also, you've neglected to mention the opposite (what's the success/failure rate for measures the UK has rallied for at Council level?)

&gt; In 1979 the UK was represented in 19.5% of parliamentary seats, in 2014 it had dropped below 10%

This tends to happen when the union expands to cover an increased population and (relatively) ours becomes smaller.

Most of the commonwealth is thousands of miles away, and are refocussing on China and other developing markets which are closer and more relevant to them (Australia, New Zealand), or are restricted markets themselves (India), or are too small to make a big impact on the UK economy.

    (a)distributes or circulates a terrorist publication;
    (b)gives, sells or lends such a publication;
    (c)offers such a publication for sale or loan;
    (d)provides a service to others that enables them to obtain, read, listen to or look at such a publication, or to acquire it by means of a gift, sale or loan;
    (e)transmits the contents of such a publication electronically; or
    (f)has such a publication in his possession with a view to its becoming the subject of conduct falling within any of paragraphs (a) to (e).   

 Unless they can bend (f) around to mean if you view it, you might be intending to disseminate it at a later date.

The word ""viewing"" does not appear anywhere in the act.

I do very very advanced system admin for a living. The specific industry that I do it in would make an instant multimillionaire out of any tech person who found a way to uniquely and with &gt; 95% reliability identify a user from their internet traffic, and there have been decades spent on efforts to do so. Such things are not technically possible based on a simple web visit to a webpage, regardless of what GCHQ wants you to believe. Thats the same GCHQ btw, who constantly complain about their best staff leaving to go to private industry, in case you are going to try the 'but the government has the better technical staff!' line. They do not, by their own admissions.



Even with fake websites, that doesnt change anything.  All they would have is the data from the web request to the load balancer or the web server. That request simply contains your IP address and a browser user agent. (It also contains your browsers cookies for that web domain but thats not relevant). That information is not sufficient to identify a specific user, regardless of what the police would like you to believe. All if gives you is an internet connection, and a browser id string. The browser id string can be fake trivially and wouldnt stand up againt any decent defense lawyer in court, and the IP address could be used by anyone passing nearby.



If they seized your computer, then they can look at the history and offline page content it stores. But even then that doesnt prove you looked at the sites - anyone can open a link and be redirected to a website, and it'll show in your browsing history and offline content. Doesnt matter if you closed it soon as the page loaded, the content is still there. So are they going to prosecute based on you loading web pages now ? that'll be fun - advertising networks get viruses/malware inserted to them regularly , soon as someone inserts one that opens such a site in the background, suddenly the entire country is 'guilty' without knowing it

true,glueface,null,null,"I grew up near Brum and only go back occasionally, but I keep tabs on some of the arts and museum things going on back home (and I noticed not many people have talked about the arts yet).

Birmingham's creative scene is enjoying a bit of a renaissance recently I think, with the development of Digbeth and especially the [Custard Factory](http://www.custardfactory.co.uk/). The other cultural bit would be the [Jewellery Quarter](http://www.jewelleryquarter.net/), which used to have a ton of jewellery shops and other industries, and since most of those died its started to fill up with flats, galleries, and nice pubs. It also has a [pen museum](http://www.penroom.co.uk/) (did you know Birmingham once produced 75% of the world's pens?).

Modern art is best done by [IKON](http://ikon-gallery.org/), who also have a satellite thing called [Eastside Project](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3123/2601542562_bd14ba7ba5_o.jpg) in Digbeth, which is usually installation or performance art. The museums are also really good in Birmingham - [Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery](http://www.bmag.org.uk/) has one of the best [Pre-Raphaelite collections in the world](http://bmagblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/return_of_the_last_of_england_03-scaled1000.jpg?w=500&amp;h=350), [Aston Hall](http://www.britevents.com/img/event_pictures/titles/aston_hall.jpg) is a 17th century mansion in the middle of the city, and we still have [Matthew Bolton's house](http://www.interestingtimestours.co.uk/uploads/images/15921-Birmingham-Soho-House.jpg) (father of the Industrial Revolution, along with James Watt).

Otherwise, we have a few universities which mean there are loads of students milling around and staying in the city - [Birmingham University](http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Images/Campus/arial-campus.jpg) has the [Barber Institute of Fine Arts](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CC8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fbarber.org.uk%2F&amp;ei=x6MxU96fEMPN7AaF9IDYCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEYxK0hfoYbxFQAGTqIix2r27qg1A&amp;sig2=nF1nJLU1PAiWAj_aHfga3Q&amp;bvm=bv.63587204,d.ZGU) for instance, and Birmingham City University has a good arts program I think. Then there's other things, like the recent pop-up art gallery [The Loft](https://twitter.com/LoftBham), the [mac](https://macbirmingham.co.uk/) has a great young people's program etc.

Basically, there's a lot going on - it's a young city and it feels that way. It's actually a medieval town, but alongside the [old](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Sarehole_Mill.jpg) we have loads of [new](http://eat-the-midlands.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/the-cube-birmingham-016-300x242.jpg) [buildings](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02653/Library_of_Birming_2653544b.jpg), and very often we have [both](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/BirminghamBullRingFromNorth.jpg) of them alongside each other. We also have some - in my opinion - great brutalist buildings, like [Central Library](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Chamberlain_Square,_Birmingham_April_2007.jpg), most of which are now being demolished.

true,[deleted],null,null,"I could also talk about the English pubs that were full of people booing Andrew Murray but anecdotal evidence is not going to get us anywhere. Let's just focus on our figures now.

We all want to have the best impact on the world and for everything we have in Britain we have been let down by shit governments and squandered our shared wealth. You would be really shocked at the amount of poverty there actually is in the UK (and it feels pretty awful in Scotland). Sometimes it isn't to do with the amount of money spent but the distribution of it and it leads you to question how European countries with smaller GDPs seem to consistently rank above the UK in OCED tables. We are the worst at everything almost.

Ok you really don't understand. You can't keep analysing single aspects like inflation and interest rates because you will never paint a proper picture that way. None of your links have contained any sort of figures on UK expenditure and taxation which is the only reliable comparison (since they cancel out the need of those variables for everyone).

It's pretty well documented that the treasury has mislead Scotland for a long time. They spent years trying to move the maritime boundary (so that waters a few miles off of Dundee count as English) and secretly succeeded in the 90s but then went on to find that this had no basis in international law. Tricks like this had been done many times before this and there are a few documentaries you can watch on the subject.

Let's get onto those 06/07 figures. Please don't use wikipedia as a direct source in something like this because the figures are not organised in a meaningful way and you have to go digging for methodology. As I said earlier every region in the UK receives more than it gives back from the treasury and has done for a while (eventually during good years it will return to a surplus). 

I don't really understand - you haven't given the English tax receipts? You are quite right that per capita Scottish people received £220 more from the treasury than England did; I'm not disputing that.

What we need to really find out to judge the significance of that figure is what England paid in.

Let's look at the HMRC statistical analysis for 06/07 (http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/statistics/receipts/disagg-method.pdf)- You might want to look at the methodology if you're a bit unfamiliar with how these types of analyses are constructed.

We see that from Table 1, which indicates the revenue share when oil is allocated in the internationally recognised manner, that the percentage of taxation from England is 85%; Wales 3.5%; NI 2.6%; Scotland 9.3%.

Now we need to find a percentage of spending in the same year so we'll use the matching treasury figures (http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101128151454/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/11%283%29.pdf). Unhelpfully it doesn't list the spending figures in the same way as the HMRC so a few excel calculations are required. Page 3 lists £359184million spending for England, Page 5 lists £43718 for Scotland, Page 7 lists £24237 for Wales and Page 9 lists £15658 for NI.

The Sum of all those numbers = £442797

which means percentage of expenditure is 81% in England; Wales 5.5%; NI 3.5% and Scotland 9.9% so Scotland contributes 0.6% more and England 4% more meaning both nations contribute more to the union than get back in spending.

Now you must consider that since those figures were from the whole population then they need a further translation to give per capita. To compare who relatively contributes more then you need to divide 0.6% by ≈5000000 for Scotland and 4% by ≈50000000 for England:
the factor for Scotland comes out to be 1.2*10^-7 and for England 8*10^-8. As that factor comes back greater for Scotland then it shows that the difference in taxation and expenditure is more significant on the Scottish population than England.",0,1395763675,null,0,false,0,cgbj7b2,t3_217oul,t1_cgbj7b2,t1_cgbes9j,null,1433061870,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,up_yer_arse_mate,eng-cumberland,Cumberland,"First off, I'm not suggesting that people aren't expected to speak English. Yes, English is the #1 language in England and people should at least make an effort to use it. For older immigrants it may never be possible to get fully up to speed but some pidgin english would be a step in the right direction.

&gt; Why?

* Because we live in a global community. It's not unreasonable to expect more and more business to be globally collaborative, and it's useful for that. It also makes it much easier for these kids in later life to travel and enjoy the world.
* Because learning languages improves language acquisition skills. The more languages you learn, the easier languages are to learn. Especially when you are young and the language acquisition part of your brain is at its most adept. I wish I had been taught several languages in primary school, instead of waiting until secondary school to learn a spot of French. Learning languages as an adult is hard.
* Because it will make integration with existing immigrant cultures in the UK easier. If you can go to a Chinese food shop and have a little, pidgin conversation with the shopkeeper at the till then how much more included will he feel, as part of the broader community, and how much more accessible will you feel the Chinese community is to you? Lots, that's how much.

&gt; When your English child passes out of this school with sub-standard English because they've been learning Hindi and Arabic... I don't think it's wrong to expect a first class education in the language of the country providing that education...

Children are already passing out of school with sub-standard English. It's got nothing to do with spending time learning other languages, it's to do with the poor standard of native-language education and increasing use of slang, netspeak etc amongst the youth. Proper English simply isn't important to them. I refer to my above point that learning languages improves language acquisition skills and posit that by exposing children to more languages their English skills will likely improve as well.",0,1395763742,null,0,false,0,cgbj8dq,t3_21b9zk,t1_cgbj8dq,t1_cgbhvsn,null,1433061884,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

---

&gt;The concept of ""[legal tender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_tender)"" is a narrow technical definition that refers to the settlement of debt, and it has little practical meaning in everyday transactions such as buying goods in shops (but does apply, for example, to the settling of a restaurant bill, where the food has been eaten prior to demand for payment and so a debt exists). Essentially, any two parties can agree to any item of value as a medium for exchange when making a purchase (in that sense, all money is ultimately an extended form of barter). If a debt exists that is legally enforceable and the debtor party offers to pay with some item that is not ""legal tender,"" the creditor may refuse such payment and declare that the debtor is in default of payment; if the debtor offers payment in legal tender, the creditor is required to accept it or else the creditor is in breach of contract. Thus, if in England party A owes party B 1,000 pounds sterling and offers to pay in Northern Ireland banknotes, party B may refuse and sue party A for nonpayments; if party A provides Bank of England notes, party B must acknowledge the debt as legally paid even if party B would prefer some other form of payment.

It's also interesting how much the change in argument surrounding cost of living has mirrored the argument around unemployment. When unemployment first started dropping there was the wailing about them not being real and speculation about zero hour contracts, part time work, and so on. That data was always available in the ONS figures but overlooked to cast doubt over the creation of new jobs. Now I see something similar with the cost of living. 

Wages are predicted to outpace inflation in the near future and, indeed, are already doing so in the private sector. What's the first response? The inflation figures are being manipulated. They account for silly things like electronics. Housing is excluded from this particular metric (ok I'm happy to grant this one as not being realistic but...).

The new deal from 2010ish means that we gave them a extra million or so per year as a flat fee but also eliminated the percentage over 32,000 as a precursor to the 60,000 seater expansion.  They were getting about £35,000 a match from us and presuming 25 home games it means that they went from £600,000 - £875,000 of possible revenue to £1.2m of definite revenue that they can make projections with in their annual budgets.

true,stadiumseating,null,null,"After having glanced at the thread I'm surprised that no one has mentioned a deep-lying playmaker. Greg Stobart mentioned on the e-Spurs podcast that he feels it should be our top priority and I fully agree.

Since selling Modric we have sorely lacked a player who can set the tempo, switch play quickly, and provide incisive passes from deep positions that get the defense on its heels and eventually lead to goal-scoring opportunities. I think a large part of our difficulty in scoring against disciplined defenses can be attributed to the lack of this type of player.

I think Bentaleb will eventually develop into a DLP but for now he's more suited to the box-to-box role. He keeps play ticking over nicely but he lacks the kind of incision that we are crying out for. Perhaps he has been instructed to keep it simple and play within himself. Regardless, with him, Dembele and Paulinho in the squad we are overloaded at that position.

It's possible that Carroll or Holtby could fill this void but I'm skeptical. Multiple managers have seen fit to play Holtby as a No. 10 rather than in central midfield and we don't know whether Carroll will be able to make it at the level we aspire to. He should have been given a PL loan and if we couldn't secure that he should have been sent off to a more technical league such as Italy or Spain to get experience in the top flight. The Championship is totally unsuited to a player of his attributes.

In the summer I'd look to sell one of Dembele or Paulinho and bring in a DLP. Who that would be I have no idea, but it's an area that needs to be addressed.

Before the destruction of Death Star I, it was under guard by the 501.

Guarding Death Star I was a pretty boring gig, and the 501 got a bit soft. Death Star I was very massive, and had a large prison section. There was an uprising from Rebel prisoners in an attempt to steal a shuttle and escape. Normally the 501 would have utterly crushed the Rebels. However, like I said, playing guard was a boring gig and they had gotten pretty soft, and hadn't seen combat in a long time. The 501 did beat down the rebellion, but it took them a lot more effort, and cost them more than anyone thought it should have.

At the same time, the plans for Death Star I went missing. There's a good argument to be made that the uprising was never meant to succeed, and was just a feint to keep the Empire's focus - and the 501 - busy so the plans could be stolen.

Vader was pretty pissed, and rightfully so. He'd lost his plans, and his pride and joy legion had gotten run around the ring much harder than was acceptable, by a large margin. Nobody would dare attack Death Star I head-on, and the most threatening rebels were killed in the uprising. Vader didn't see a problem changing out the guard on Death Star I for a much less trained group, while he sent the 501 out into the galaxy to both search for the plans, and brush up on their combat skills.

But that's not the same as moving to a country en-masse, and ending up in a small community of expats also from the UK. In situations like these there are generally efforts on behalf of both the expat community and the host community to integrate. Besides, I'm sure you'd be grateful if a couple of people there did learn a few words of English to help you feel more at home.

&gt; Why should Urdu or Polish etc. be accepted as the global language...

Why should English? Like you say, it's the third most practised language in the world. That puts us behind Mandarin and Spanish. I've worked with Chinese engineers in the past and the effort they put in to learning English in order to collaborate was incredible. I was somewhat ashamed that our English team didn't make the same effort. They did appreciate it a lot, however, when I learnt a little Chinese and it made the collaborative effort suddenly a whole lot easier and immensely more enjoyable because it was symbolic that everyone was willing to meet in the middle, not just sit in the corner with arms crossed and insist that everyone else conforms to their idea of what is right.

In the end though, I don't think there will be a ""global language"". Language is too disparate and too integrated into society and culture for that too happen in the next couple of centuries at least.

&gt; I've no issue with the change of ethnic make-up of our communities but do object to the idea...

I don't think anyone is expressing that opinion. It looks to me from the article like they're teaching kids English as a foreign language to help them adjust to life in the UK. Certainly I'm not saying that immigrants need to make an effort to integrate, of course they do, that's just part-and-parcel of what immigration is. I do think that they can make valid criticisms of host communities who do nothing in order to help them integrate though. It's in everyone's interests to improve cultural integration and sticking immigrants in ethnically gated communities, ghettoising those communities and then complaining about them serves nobody. I'm also not suggesting that the people of that community should have no say in it either.

Put it another way...

If you have to stay at my house for a week so you can do some work in the area, of course I'd expect you to make an effort to fit in with my way of living, do the dishes the way I like them done and not get under my feet but at the same time I'd try and make you feel welcome when you arrived and offer you a cup of tea and a slice of cake. You're there and we have to make the best of the situation. It can either be an enjoyable stay for both of us or we can come out the other end detesting each other. Again, it's a collaborative effort.

That's likely to be Spurs/Everton (maybe United) this season, and those 3 teams have between them Lukaku, Adebayor, Van Persie, Rooney &amp; Soldado. 5 Very good Strikers, (Although Soldado has dipped since last season ofc).

Suarez, Rooney, Giroud, Aguero, Lukaku, Van Persie, Benteke, Negredo, Adebayor, Dzeko, Bony, Lambert, Remy, Michu, Rodriguez, Eto'o, Ba.

If you break into being one of those ""top"" players in the prem, you are doing very well in my view. Certainly breaking into that group of players was not what most pundits were talking about when the Sturridge transfer was being talked about.

Besides, top 10 forward ""for sure"" was meant as ""at least"". I personally had a total fanboy hard-on for him and when he transferred to Liverpool I absolutely thought he was going to exceed expectations (not quite to the level he has... more thinking a &gt;=0.5 goal/game striker vs the &gt;0.8 he is shaping up to be) but that just sounds like I'm 20/20 hind sighting because I have no proof of that.

Besides, the price we paid probably necessitated he become at least a top 10 striker, but the expectation other clubs had of him was basically to be another version of Torres' Chelsea form.

I do agree with your point on him benefitting in being in a team that works to his best attributes, while I do think he'd do better at Chelsea than Eto'o or Ba are, I don't think he'd be in the blistering form he currently is - Rodger's brand of football suits him for sure.",0,1395767499,null,0,1395767907,0,cgbl1i4,t3_21ay8c,t1_cgbl1i4,t1_cgbkd51,null,1433062736,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Because all parties affected by the political system they compete in.

No, you've dodged it three times, shifting the work on to a mod. It's all well and good *saying* you can definitely verify it, but *until you actually do* you haven't verified anything.

&gt;I said hes hasn't studied this monetary economics, you strawman man it into me saying hes incompetent, and attack that strawman.

So, if he *is* competent, why mention the fact he hasn't studies monetary economics? Because even if he hasn't, if he's not incompetent he must know what he's talking about. You can't have it both ways.

&gt;Economics as used in a bank is different from academic economics. Bank economics is far more shallow.

And how does this matter when applied to accessing the viability of a currency union between iScotland and rUK?

Look. Explain to me, very simply, why a currency union would be bad. And then explain to me why Deutsche Bank would think differently. That's been the point from the start. That's why you claimed there wouldn't be an optimal currency area (without explaining at all), that's why you claimed Deutsche Bank was wrong (and you did) and that's why you claim to be superior to me and Oliver Hardy in this case (again, without demonstrating or proving how).",0,1395768703,null,0,false,0,cgblnek,t3_215132,t1_cgblnek,t1_cgafgc3,null,1433063023,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Our major growth areas in the next few years are looking to come from better utilisation of our player images with markets in New York and Melbourne now opened, more foreign tours in the pre/post season, the concerts and Rugby World Cup at the Etihad, the bump in the Nike deal and a lowering of our overall expenses.

[Our CEO has said that we're going to break even this year](http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/02/11/uk-soccer-england-city-finance-idUKBREA1A18220140211) after historical losses, and I think much of that is going to be through greater commercial income and a lowering of the wage bill (in the last accounts we had an exceptional payment to Mancini and all of his staff would was worth about £15m-£20m).  We also would have completed building our Academy at the end of this season thus won't have those costs though the stadium expansion starts at that point so I'm not sure of the effects on the balance sheet.

I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to really explain the situation and you taking the time out to get to grips with it.  There's lots of things said about our financial position which I don't feel paint an accurate picture of where we are at the moment in terms of growth and it's nice to have a good faith discussion .

I actually want to bring this back to my original point which I feel has gone off track a bit.  The Champions League isn't the holy grail just because it provides excellent broadcasting income but because it affects the worldwide visibility that commercial deals are based upon.

I know a few cupla focla myself and can have a very basic conversation with close relatives in Irish. I have cousins and Irish is actually their first language and they are pissed off at SFs use of Irish in everything. Take a look at the NI assembly, everything has to be translated into Irish at what benefit and more importantly, at what cost?

The Irish Language act which SF wanted a few years ago would have insisted that every government document, local and Assembly, be translated into Irish. What purpose would the minutes of a Larne borough council meeting being translated into Irish serve? None whatsoever.

I think the use of Weapon is an exaggeration but I understand why people think SF want to ram it down peoples throats. If you want to learn Irish, that's great, I'm all for people learning a second, third language. But at the end of the day and let's be realistic, other than some romantic notion of days gone by, what purpose does the Irish language serve?

Let it thrive of its own accord or let it slowly disappear. Either way, I'm not fussed.

I personally don't think Irish or Ulster Scots promotes multiculturalism. I think Ulster English shows that we have a separate identity within the uk complete with our own culture, our own interpretation of the English language with our own traditions.

true,kineticpuma,num5,,"My take on this is that by starting Eriksen out wide, it causes an issue for opposition player marking him. Does he track his run inside or leave an overload in the middle of the park. I think whoever plays in the hole has to be in sync with this. In this case Chadli has to try and move the Midfielders there to afford Eriksen the space as he cuts in. If Eriksen starts in the middle he might find himself marked more easily and have to go into wider areas, which is not where we want to see him. Feel free to counter that, but it's the only rationale I have to it. 

A second key point I would like to raise is to what happens when we transition from attack to defense. As the article points out, Southampton had far too much space on our left side. This is where the two holding midfielders are so key. They must cover that space until Eriksen can work back to fill it. Dembele was clearly not 100% and thus couldn't do the running required. 

In conclusion that's my take on what we do. Eriksen starts wide to create a marking conundrum for the opposition and if the team all recognise Eriksen's movement, they can provide adequate cover to keep the shape in a transition.

From someone who has watched about 20 'Air crash investigation' episodes in the past 2 weeks.. Pilots doing stupid nonsensical shit brings down a ton of planes. 

Hell, look at Air France's crash a few years ago. The co pilot purposely KEPT IT IN A STALL for about 25,000 feet just because he lost his air speed reading. Even after the most senior pilot asked to take over control he kept his hand on the joystick to keep the nose pointed up. He only mentioned he'd been pointing the nose up when they were at about 5,000 feet. It belly flopped into the water.

We held onto Modric for two seasons after big clubs started flirting with him and before the 11-12 season there was massive pressure on Levy from Modric and Madrid to let him go. We held onto Bale for a year after he was making noises to leave and got £85m in recompense. We got £30.75m for Berbatov which was frankly brilliant negotiating, and we got £18m for Carrick which was a lot back in 2006. £20m for Keane was also a silly move by Liverpool and was excellent business for us. 

We didn't manage to hold onto these players of course, but when our wage limit is £60k/wk and these other clubs are offering more than twice that, holding out forever isn't really feasible. This unfortuantely puts us in a viscous circle where we can't hold on to the players that would establish us as Champions League regulars, and without being able to offer regular Champions League football we don't have that extra incentive to keep our best players. The best we can hope for is a big payday, and we're the best in Europe at that. There are only a handful of top European clubs that have the financial muscle to hold onto their best players. Even Arsenal have repeatedly been raided by the Manchester clubs, and they're in decent financial shape. 

EDIT: What I don't understand though is why our wage structure has stayed the same for a decade. 60k/wk is £3.12m p.a. so if it's wages the player is after why not double his wage and keep a fantastic player instead of buying a new one of lower quality, weakening the team in the short term and weakening us financially in the long term by missing out on league positions/European qualification.

What happened in AF447 appeared more to be a failure or rather complete lack of CRM.  Crisis Response Management.  I could start being all high and mighty, suggesting that they forgot the most important parts of their training, Aviate, Navigate, Communicate just didn't happen.  One pilot should have been given the job of holding level, a check on the AI and power settings would have suggested a failure of the pitot static system, the second pilot should have realised this.

But mostly, they shouldn't have flown into the CB in the first place.

This is what we'd be say in a ground school class.  Up in the air it's differen't.  A few months ago I'd gone up for a bimble about with a couple of friends, I was caught up in some *air rage* as someone was violating the rules of the circuit, I was un-able to land.  £50 had been spent, I was burning fuel I hadn't planned for, the girl in the back was feeling motion sick, because I was in a higher performance craft, I was struggling to go slow.  So I decided to be a cunt, I didn't break a rule, so figured I'd be the *better* pilot in the situation.  What I hadn't realised is this was a student pilot, who was cocking everything up, including declaring he was a student pilot on solo.  So as you can imagine what I did next wouldn't have helped matters at all, as he was turning to cross, I cleaned up my craft, and gave it the beans, I shot inside him, declared my downwind (I'd assumed his incredibly wide circuit leg was him leaving the pattern) and slipped the plane in (when you turn slightly sideways to slow faster).

I like that club a lot, because what followed I can only describe as a circle bollocking between myself, the instructor responsible for the student and another senior instructor.  We talked it out, what we should do differently and agreed the need to announce, should the student fail too, that they are a student pilot fucking everything up.

I would like to pretend I'm a better person, but clearly, I'm not, I'm fallable, liable to get into a burst of emotional anger by someone else not playing by the rules, do the exact same thing myself.

The Air France situation is complex, there was a failure of piloting (flying into CB) a failure of CRM (failure to allocate roles definitavely) but also a failure of design, the pitot static shouldn't have failed in the way it did, the 'stick shaker' used to signify differing control inputs feels just like the stall warning.

He hasn't really said anything that would qualify as a demand to leave or even an intent to leave.  

In the first interview he was asked if he would leave if we didn't qualify for CL...his response was basically ""i am focused on the season at hand and then the world cup after that we will see.""...not really a statement that he is leaving, just not a statement that he is staying, just a very typical athlete response...i am focused on the task at hand and then after that if there are questions to be answered i will see what happens.

The second interview he gave he said he would be with Spurs next season. He admitted that he deserved to get called out by Sherwood. They asked him if he had signed a new contract and he said no.  Again, not a damning resposne but this time he stated he would be with the club just that they hadn't given him a new improved contract (which we are rumored to be doing).

In his third interview he stated that he would 100% be with Spurs next season and that he was committed to getting Spurs to CL. The papers referred to this as a ""hint"" about his future.

Guy seems to be getting caught in the spin cycle by the media, even when he says he is staying they turn it into ""Vertonghen is 100% leaving Spurs"".

I have no doubt that someone may inquire about him, i wouldn't be at all surprised that we would listen and may even sell.  But at this point he hasn't said anything to make it sound like he is demanding a move yet the media spin it as he as clamouring to get out as soon as possible.",0,1395777956,null,0,false,0,cgbqbm2,t3_21bjtu,t1_cgbqbm2,t1_cgbpy0k,null,1433065290,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

For me he probably gets bullied off the ball too easily to play the position, being able to wriggle out of tight spaces is so important for a DLP. If you get pushed off the ball frequently it's a massive liability as the opposition by definition gain possession in a dangerous area. I also wonder whether or not he has the intelligence and vision to be the metronome that we're lacking.

I know from my own experiences, I'm fallible.  It's easy to criticise someone for acting poorly in a situation you've never been close too.

* AI = Attitude Indicator.  Tells you how your advances on the flight attendants are going, also it's got a blue and brown bit, showing how the plane is angled relative to the horizon.  It's one of the three basic instruments you hope never to loose in flight (Air Speed, and Altimeter being the others)

* CB = Thunderstorm Clouds.  These aren't something to fly into, you'll have a bad time.

If I missed any others just ask.

As is the course, the sequence and timing of the events point to some deliberate action.  What was the motive for it, we can only speculate.

I wouldn't want to conflate that with pilot error.  This is very different, even before the FDR was found for AF447, it was already having the arm chair quarterbacks blaming their pilotage for going into the CB.

I don't think this is in any way going to be pilot error, too much of the plane failed in a specific way.  Sadly it looks like a direct action by someone on the flight deck.  As such I'm shocked that the Malay authorities didn't immediately seize all possessions of the pilots and flight crew, the most likely suspects.  There should be a good old fashioned police style investigation into the crew.  Sadly, my understanding of Malay culture suggests this won't happen without significant external pressure, I've heard speculation that the NTSB have already been trying to force this.",0,1395779456,null,0,false,0,cgbr44m,t3_21ayrv,t1_cgbr44m,t1_cgbqcd2,null,1433065664,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2
