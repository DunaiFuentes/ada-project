Again nothing to back your argument up. Alonso's case is ridiculous? Arbelos's case is ridiculous? I think you're ridiculous.

&gt; And how about Villa? Maybe he got picked instead of Torres because Torres was struggling with injuries and Villa was playing better?

Torres was struggling with injuries in 2008? LOL. He only ever missed 2-3 games at a stretch, and had 38 appearances in all competitions. Liverpool finished 2nd that season.

&gt;But no, it's all a giant conspiracy by Del Bosque. Even though Mata, Torres, Silva, Costa, Azpiliqueta and Fabregas all got called up while playing in the EPL.

Who gives a shit about who got called up? Point is who was the established member of the team? Mata has started on the bench more times than he's started in the line-up, even after the season where he had 20 goals and 28 assists. Costa got called up while he was in Spain. Azpi got called up while in Spain. I don't know why you keep bringing Silva up because he got called up while playing in Spain and already had 32 caps before moving to City. Why are you mentioning Torres again? Regardless, he had 16 caps before moving to Liverpool and was named in the FIFA Pro XI the year Del Bosque was hired. He would've got a lot of flack for not picking Torres.

&gt;Even Michu got a fucking call up. The guy that nobody cared about in Spain and only was picked up by Del Bosque when he was doing well in the PL.

He got called up to replace... guess who... Fernando fucking Torres, the guy you claim was Del Bosque's favourite. Also Michu only has 1 cap so its not even like he was part of the team.

I think I'll just accept that you are determined to perceive me that way no matter what, as it would be paradoxical for me to now begin to engage in an equally boring discussion of the differences between our conversation and those that you may have enjoyed with tumblr users in the past, much as my reputation and social standing with /u/nowai0 is of great value to me. I'll lament my falling from grace in your eyes.

Amusing reply for you to give if you want this to go full meta:

The first two Doctors are all in black and white, and can be quite dated. Watch the very first arc, *An Unearthly Child*, or at least the first part of it, just to see how it all began. Fair warning: the Doctor was a very different character at the start. He wasn't really heroic yet, more a crazy, mysterious and somewhat amoral old man traveling through time with his granddaughter. 

And I highly recommend the 2nd Doctor arc *The Mind Robbers.* By Troughton's time the Doctor had become more like the heroic figure we now know, and he was traveling with companions rather than his granddaughter and her [](/s ""kidnapped teachers"").

I, apparently wrongly, assumed by saying that you'd know a fact or two to back it up rather than relying on what appears to be complete and utter twaddle. Having a sense of smell means the square route of bugger all.

&gt;As for I should move, how about get fucked and stop poisoning people who need a bus.

Your argument then is pretty much 'stop doing what I don't like doing' I see. I assume you wouldn't take up smoking for me? Then why should I be the only one accommodating your wants? With each passing comment all that's becoming apparent is how much of a 'my way or no way' person you actually are.

If he improves his decision making he will have so many more assists against better teams. 

Moving the ball forward is key! In his defence Lamela does do this, but he always goes for the more complicated ball inside rather than looking for the simple overlap. This normally results in the ball being intercepted or crowded out. 

End of the day, I want Lamela to be awesome! But even with the highest assists in the team he has not impressed me enough.

false,wiggen_tree,eng-lestershire,"In Manchester, from Leicester.","It's hilarious to read all these comments from people who want to ban e-cigs because they don't like the smell and ""You don't know what's in it"". I wonder how many still happily frequent a boozer that has a motion sensitive air freshener in the toilet, that squirts out a puff of rancid, chemical shit whenever someone walks through the door. Or how many of them gladly use those things in their homes, or spray a can of pesticide around the house if an insect happens to come in.  
There's a very weird trend going on at the minute that seems to demonize anyone who uses nicotine in any way, that is bordering on hysterical.   
Don't misunderstand me here, I'm very well aware of how addictive nicotine can be and I'm also entirely pro smoking bans in public places, but banning e-cigs just seems like a step too far, I don't like the smell of Red Bull, but I don't get all pissy when someone next to me at the bar orders one.  
Finally, and this is where my point is made, how many non-smokers ever went home from the pub before the ban, with their hair and clothes stinking of fags and their throat dry from smoke and thought ""I'd really love a fag right now.""?   
If you can stand to be around the chemical deodorisers and the rank perfume and over-applied deodorant spray that are prevalent in today's boozers, then there's absolutely no reason to ban e-cigs. Whatever chemical that's in them is food grade, and therefore much less harmful than the Febreeze they squirt all over the place, the nicotine isn't going to automatically make you addicted to nicotine from four feet away, and it's a damn sight better than being in a boozer full of smoke any fucking day, and I say this as a smoker of traditional, tobacco cigarettes.

&gt; They'd love Farage to not be so outspoken!

Yes they probably would, luckily they abide by their own rules. So your point is moot.

&gt; At a committee level what's the point of a talking shop when you know how the vote is going to go?

Might as well not even be part of Westminster parliament then because ""you know how the vote is going to go"". What a stupid statement, honestly.

&gt; They've kicked the door open of 3 party politics

Funny, i dont remember the lib dems ever winning a majority, do you? pretty silly how UKIP supporters think that its ""3 party politics"" when lib dems have only been relevant for this single coalition government and will lose many votes next GE (im predicting atleast).

&gt; They warned about the Euro crisis years in advance.

So did many people who advocated the EU, the EZ and the EU are not the same thing.

&gt;  They even warned against EU policy giving rise to the likes of Golden Dawn.

as well as the likes of UKIP? They seem to attract many far right xenophobes and racists as well, are we going to ignore this and bash on Golden Dawn instead? that hypocrisy.

&gt; It's the EU that has been uncompromising towards Federalism and it has cost the EU dear.

Again EU and EZ not the same.

&gt; Why on Earth would you expect them to table motions through a body which they state they don't believe any motions should be passed, which they wish to disband?

So why even be part of the European parliament? They are damaging British interests by not voting.

&gt; That's like complaining the Tories aren't socialist enough because they aren't socialists.

Worst analogy 2014.

Its actually more like a Scottish bloke being voted in as an MP of Westminster parliament and then never turning up to help change his county for the better in Scotland whilst simultaneously accusing parliament of ""antidemocratic practices"" and ""hurting Scottish interests"". Do you see the lunacy?

&gt; They've not taken nearly enough.
That's UK taxpayer money.

Its also 27 other nations tax money, so you are are pretty much advocating thievery.

&gt; It is inevitable the UK will leave the EU at some point

Conjecture.

&gt;  because the UK cannot follow the EU into federalism and that's where the deflating EZ must go.

Fiscal policy =/= federalism, although i agree the EU is marching towards federalism (slowly) the EZ can be successful without federalism.

&gt; replacing a course to EU federalism for a course of trade and UK accountability: their service is priceless.

What makes you think we can suddenly trade with everyone when we leave the EU? You do understand that we are free to trade with whomever we want right? Its just easier and much cheaper for British businesses to trade with the EU because we have the same regulations and there are no tariffs or taxes.

&gt;&gt;They'd love Farage to not be so outspoken!

&gt;Yes they probably would, luckily they abide by their own rules. So your point is moot.

Rather than moot you're conceding that Farage does a lot of speaking out!  You started by saying you couldn't say he worked hard enough to call it a job.  You said he wasn't partaking in debate - now he's debating too much?!?

&gt;Might as well not even be part of Westminster parliament then because ""you know how the vote is going to go"". What a stupid statement, honestly.

Hardly, the Labour and Conservative back benches are full of rebels, whereas in Europe it's all bloc lead, quid pro quo, and the nature of the plenary vote is blocs vote off paper.  

Apples and oranges; it really is, although I don't blame you not for not having a greater appreciation for how voting in Europe works.  It's aloofness is a subject of great controversy.   Many people in the Europeans didn't even know they were voting for a President!

&gt;&gt;They've kicked the door open of 3 party politics

&gt;Funny, i dont remember the lib dems ever winning a majority, do you? 

Are you trying to argue we don't have 3 party politics?

THEY'RE IN A COALITION GOVERNMENT!

You're turning this bizarre.     

&gt;&gt;They warned about the Euro crisis years in advance.

&gt;So did many people who advocated the EU, the EZ and the EU are not the same thing.

Nowhere have I given you cause to think that I was using EU and EZ interchangeably, so that's another bizarre thing to say. 

It's more bizarre to defend people who warned about the EZ (which in itself does change the nature of the EU) but still advocated and went into it!   

&gt;&gt;They even warned against EU policy giving rise to the likes of Golden Dawn.

&gt;as well as the likes of UKIP? 

It's laughable that you want to equate UKIP with Golden Dawn, when UKIP actively warned against it.   

It's responses like this that have propelled UKIP in the polls.

&gt;&gt;It's the EU that has been uncompromising towards Federalism and it has cost the EU dear.

&gt;Again EU and EZ not the same.

Again, never said it was, but the EU is moving towards Federalism and ever closer union.  You seem to think non-EZ countries aren't being pulled in.  

&gt;So why even be part of the European parliament? They are damaging British interests by not voting.

To report to the UK electorate what the EU is up to.  They're protecting British interests and using its own resources against it.  Smart.

&gt;Worst analogy 2014.  Its actually more like a Scottish bloke being voted in as an MP of Westminster parliament and then never turning up to help change his county for the better in Scotland whilst simultaneously accusing parliament of ""antidemocratic practices"" and ""hurting Scottish interests"".
 
Only they do turn up, when it is right for them to do so.  There's nothing wrong with the analogy.  You're complaining about an independence party not behaving like good little Eurocrats.  Of course they don't.

&gt;&gt;They've not taken nearly enough. That's UK taxpayer money.

&gt;Its also 27 other nations tax money, so you are are pretty much advocating thievery.

I'm pretty sure the UK pays in more than it takes out.  They'd have a long way to go before 'thievery' is remotely sane.  Besides, it's all legal.

&gt;&gt;It is inevitable the UK will leave the EU at some point

&gt;Conjecture.

Nope.  There is no desire for further powers to go to the EU.  At best people want it to stay the same.  Unfortunately (or fortunately for me) there is now a European Union Act 2011 and the EU desperately needs more reform to tackle the ongoing crisis.  The two are divergent.

&gt;Fiscal policy =/= federalism, although i agree the EU is marching towards federalism (slowly) the EZ can be successful without federalism.

Not been paying much to the ESM, have you.   

In fact it sounds like you haven't been paying much attention since before Lisbon, or didn't listen to the presidential debates.

&gt;What makes you think we can suddenly trade with everyone when we leave the EU?

The WTO.

&gt;You do understand that we are free to trade with whomever we want right?

Not with Free Trade Agreements we're not.  There's a Common External Tariff.  The EU's a custom union.  It's protectionist.

&gt;Its just easier and much cheaper for British businesses to trade with the EU because we have the same regulations and there are no tariffs or taxes.

90+% of UK trade isn't with the EU (80% is domestic).  All UK business must currently use EU regulations, however clumbersome.  We could reduce SME regulation and let those that trade with the EU continue to do so using EU regs - much as when we trade with the US or India we meet US or Indian regs.

Of course there would still be no tariffs or taxes because the Union of European Federalists have already offered the UK AA status, which well they might because trade negotitation without prejudice is guaranteed for an exiting state under Lisbon, and an obligation under the WTO.  A trade deal is a given.

&gt;You continue to show your lack of understanding of how a trade agreement works.

I'm pretty sure Digby Jones knows more about it than you.  Former Director General of the CBI and Minister of State for Trade and Investment    under Gordon Brown.  Spoke at the Conservative conference in 2014, UKIP at 2013:

I think Moreno, Manquillo, Origi, Can, Lallana will all prove to be excellent signings. Balotelli and Markovic have the benefit of time on their side to show their quality.

I agree to a point that we will struggle to get out the group stage, but considering our fortunes over the last 5 years it's just so refreshing to be playing Real Madrid in a midweek CL match. I honestly cannot wait, no matter what the score.

We really don't know what Liverpool is going to turn up, we don't know what Madrid is going to turn up. They won their last game but not convincingly against Ludogorets, they have the classico on the weekend to think about.

I felt quietly confident with Sturridge coming back into the side, I felt as though we could have a real go and come away with a win. Without him it seems unlikely but I don't think we're going to get thrashed like a lot probably do.

In some ways I think of this game similar to the 3rd game we played last season against United. Now I'm in no way saying United were anywhere near as good as Madrid are right now but I just remember going into that game off the back of a couple of good wins where we struggled to really get going but defended well with Toure one of the best players but he got injured and we were all worried about Skrtle coming into the team after a bad season the one before but we defended well and got 1-0 win.

Procedure varies from force to force, but in general it is only the officer in charge of the case who can authorise the release of property, so you need to get in touch with them. You may be asked to prove that it is yours, and not your partners and the officer in charge will have to be satisfied that they do not need it for an ongoing investigation. 

In the first instance, I would call and write to the officer in charge of the investigation (if you know who that is) and request your property be returned or be given an estimated time by when they will be able to return it. Politely explain why you need it back, and that it is yours and not your partners. It may also be worth asking work to request their laptop back separately too. 

If you don't know who the officer in charge of the case is, you should be able to find this out from the force that seized it. 

If after this the police do not return your property or haven't given you a valid reason as to why they can't release it yet, I would consider contacting a solicitor, as they can take it to the magistrates and the police can be compelled to release your property, but will only normally do so if the investigation is closed or disposed of by the courts/caution.

I would have left on Dzeko because it's nice to be able to hoof a long ball to him and have him hold it up so the test of our team can join him in to attack. This allows our back line to move up the field. Also it transitions us into more possession so we not just hitting the ball up towards Aguero and losing possession.

If it is something relatively straightforward, and it's just a case that you are in a small GPs practice with no GPs who are comfortable with your care then it should be a fairly straightforward procedure. However if it is something more complex or rare then it may take a little longer to find a solution. 

If you're willing to do the legwork and want to speed things up then you can call or write to local GPs practices and see if they would be comfortable managing your care. You can find GPs practices in your area that are currently accepting new patients on www.nhs.uk 

Failing that, you could always contact your consultant or hospital clinic directly and see if they are able to recommend any particular GPs or surgeries that they have a relationship with or who manage other patients with your condition. 

You normally need to fill in a registration form at the new practice, and they may ask you to come for a check up with the practice nurse or your GP to discuss your condition and management. 

Transferring your records can take up to six weeks, however if it is clinically urgent then the process can be sped up to 2 weeks! You can ensure that this goes as quickly as possible by providing the new practice your NHS number and letting the old practice know where your going.

**Bayern 12** (clinched first place)

**City 5**

**Roma 4**

-If it pans out that way, we may get a big advantage from the schedule. Bayern will have already clinched first place and may decide to leave some of their top players at home or on the bench.

It was silly joke about an event that took place in 1814 but, even with the passage of two centuries, it was âtoo soonâ for some Americans.

I live in DC and I think that cake was fucking hilarious. That the brits decided to apologize to idiots on twitter, is also hilarious, because there's nothing more quintessentially British than apologizing to an idiot for taking offence at something totally innocuous. 

Edit:

Read the rest of the article. War plan red was a defensive plan to respond to an invasion by, you know, the British Empire, the most powerful military force the world has ever seen, which had over a billion inhabitants, and was the only military force with the sheer manpower necessary to invade the US.

Scottish Americans were divided about 50/50 on the referendum, with the main argument for the no side being ""Britain is our closest ally, and it would be a shame for them to break up.""

They also pointed to Faslane and the GIUK Gap, and talked about Russia.

Keep in Mind, BAE systems, one of the UK's largest defense contractors is a joint US/EU endeavor. 

There's no such military industrial integration between the US and Germany, nor, honestly, would we like there to be. 

Should the UK be more assertive? Absolutely. The best thing our best friend can do when we do stupid things is to tell us ""No."" It would have been better if you refused to enable our Republican Party's addiction to war, but you were there with us, and all we have to show for those wars is ISIS and a potentially destabilized Pakistan. 

Americans who think about foreign policy do consider the UK to be our closest ally. We do care about the special relationship. I'll say that we're really nervous about austerity: you don't have a carrier strike force anymore, and the US Marines are still using the Harrier, so we don't get why you got rid of your strike fighters. Also, it's slowing your economic growth in a big way. Some intelligent government investment outside of London would be really good for your economy, but that's not our business.

This isn't an imperial poodle situation.

I think the apt description is that you're dad, and you're a pensioner now, and you're a bit more feeble than you were in your youth, and you regret some of the decisions you made, including the falling out we had with you in our twenties when we moved out in a huff, and that time we got into a big fight and you came over and set our couch on fire, that was some bullshit, and you've got some infuriatingly old ways of doing things, like how you still want to have nukes when we've been trying to work with the Russians and get rid of ours, and it would honestly be better for everyone concerned if you built a ton of aircraft carriers with that mo- no, no, dad, we get it. It's your money, you can spend it how you like it.

How about the official religion of this country?

&gt; If you buy a Hebrew slave, he is to serve for only six years.  Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom.  If he was single when he became your slave and then married afterward, only he will go free in the seventh year.  But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife will be freed with him.  If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave, and they had sons or daughters, then the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master.  But the slave may plainly declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children.  I would rather not go free.'  If he does this, his master must present him before God.  Then his master must take him to the door and publicly pierce his ear with an awl.  After that, the slave will belong to his master forever.  (Exodus 21:2-6 NLT)

&gt;When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are.  If she does not please the man who bought her, he may allow her to be bought back again.  But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.  And if the slave girl's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave girl, but he must treat her as his daughter.  If he himself marries her and then takes another wife, he may not reduce her food or clothing or fail to sleep with her as his wife.  If he fails in any of these three ways, she may leave as a free woman without making any payment.

Pay isn't about what is ""fair"". No, sir. It's about who is the stronger negotiator.

When you're in a position to walk away - but they feel they cannot find anyone to replace you (immediately) - then you are in a strong position to negotiate. But you have to be a bastard and actually push them into this. You don't win by being Mr Nice Guy.

Of course arrogance doesn't work if you can't afford to walk away. If you're desperate for work you have to take whatever is being offered.

Unfortunately in your mind you're thinking ""I was worth Â£XXX until now, I should be worth YY% more in future"". This might sound logical in your head - but it has nothing to do with the reality of business.

Look - you're a freelancer. That means you're a one-man business. Businesses try and screw each other every day. They get in bed and do dirty deals - because they both need something - maybe one company is desperate for work and compromises. But as a business you don't have what ordinary workers have - protections, expectations of pay increases, etc.

So - work on making yourself indispensable. Find competitors willing to poach you. Save money so you can afford to walk away from a negotiation.

Remember: the *loser* in any negotiation is the one that cannot afford to walk away from a deal.

Luis: Fantastic work rate all night, played with ease and passed the ball well, made tackles everywhere and pinched the ball back before Maribor could even start an attack and he was confident going on, nearly creating a few certain goals cutting into the penalty area.

Willian: Great work rate as usual, he kept possession, passed well and in general provided a very refreshing and safe attacking presence. No sloppy balls and his shot that hit the bar wow.

Drogba: He came on and won high balls and his maturity and expertise shone through. Although he didn't have the pace his passes were pin point every time, the way he opened up play with the balls he made were genius and it just shows how he's a veteran of the team.

Ake was very impressive coming on he looked like he wanted to impress and once again he ran back very quickly and had injections of pace going into the other half looking very bright and eager to make chances. Not to mention his ball to Hazard.

Zouma consist all night if you didn't know he was a newee you'd think he's been a back four starter for years. Didn't to anything wrong on one occasion to my memory faultless.

There were the usual suspects too but Hazards fucking around did annoy me especially with his first goal he got lucky to get it after he didn't tap it in when he had the chance. But on the attack he very quick tricky and other than a fair bit of greediness in the second half he was his usual self. Ivanovic was strong in defence like Zouma faultless (not sure about his dive though) same goes for Terry.  

It really goes to show the skill and the expertise of our players (a lot still very young) when you saw how they played along side the really young ones.

Unlike when I was growing up, when Footballers interspersed their chopping down of players on the pitch, with regular booze sessions [I'm looking at you, God], most modern footballers are prime examples of athleticism - you do have the odd footballer blessed with natural talent; for all their faults Gazza and Rooney are naturally gifted footballers - but most elite footballers are a combination of natural talent, and ""hard work"" over the years.

Plus - if you're a fan of a sport, what could be more heroic than the thought of growing up to spend your life doing said sport, and getting paid a small fortune.

17 When He had entered a house away from the crowd, His disciples asked Him concerning the parable. 

18 So He said to them, âAre you thus without understanding also? Do you not perceive that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him, 

19 because it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and is eliminated, thus purifying all foods?â

I spent today speaking to contract Software Testers and much of that involved the discussion of their rates and the rates my client could afford to pay. 

My job is to enter negotiations knowing what my client would *like* to pay and the bottom line they can *afford* to pay if an absolutely all-star contractor were to appear but was seeking more money ideally than was advertised. 

But some of these people - that is IT contractors - will still enter proceedings chancing their arm on far in excess of what is advertised. They then act perplexed or disinterested when they find the much higher rate they seek is *not* available. They've wasted everyone's time. 

It's a game. But you have to know how to lose gracefully on both sides and when the bottom line *really is the bottom line*.

Monaco- They have no world class keeper and are a French club with deep pockets, so naturally they are a big threat as well. I bet you AVB regrets not taking the Monaco offer after his first year at the lane.

City- They pose a big threat as well cause Hart is not to the quality of the rest of the squad. Hopefully they stick by him, as he is an academy graduate and has been performing well as of late.

Bayern- Neuer, no threat

Here is [a condemnation of the plans](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/graphic-artists-condemn-plans-to-ban-erotic-comics-1652270.html) by graphic artists when they were first announced. I'll give you a great example - Kill Bill Vol.1. Remember the anime sequence? O-Ren, aged eleven, seduces the Yakuza boss who killed her parents. We see her sat astride his naked body, in obvious sexual contact, before she reaches down for the sword and does him in.

So this is an animated depiction of sex between an eleven year old girl and a grown man. Why is it not porn, and to be prosecuted, and other stuff is? The first (legal) reason is that it has a BBFC certificate. This means that a studio can make this kind of thing, but a film student couldn't. One is a legitimate commercial enterprise, the other is a sex offender, even though they have created the same piece of art. 

The second reason why you wouldn't prosecute based on Kill Bill is that the CPS would not consider it in the public interest, as the work has artistic merit.  But this is a massive massive problem for civil liberties, because this isn't in the legislation. The act criminalises a vast swathe of people, and the state then chooses who to prosecute. This undermines the idea that the criminal law is a code that you can live by. Once we have everyone being in breach of the law, and only people being prosecuted when the government feels like it (perhaps it's because it's particularly egregious, perhaps because the tabloids have called for it against a particular person) you lose a fundamental plank of our rights - the rule of law.

Also I don't get the point. Real life CP is rightly banned because watching / downloading / viewing creates the stuff in the first place, which leads to real victims. Banning the animated stuff is not only a practical minefield, but a return to a 'ban this filth' reminiscent of the old obscene publications trials.",0,1413927483,null,0,false,0,clfyj4u,t3_2jx24f,t1_clfyj4u,t1_clfxweh,null,1426416326,59,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,59

&gt;    It is Ukip policy that the NHS would be excluded from any TTIP agreement. This policy was clearly spelled out by health spokesman Louise Bourse [sic] at our Doncaster conference.

 &gt;   ""You have been sent a copy of letter from Nigel Farage in which he clearly states that he opposed to TTIP.

  &gt;  ""The information you received from an employee of William Dartmouth was incorrect. He was not authorised to speak on matters of policy or indeed to talk to the press.""



&gt;IBTimes UK had contacted Dartmouth's office to get clarification on Ukip's policy on international trade and, in particular, TTIP. After a telephone conversation, we received answers to questions on TTIP via email from Guy Parfitt, a member of William Dartmouth's staff, who purported to be ""his press officer"" and who had claimed to have received the answers from Dartmouth.

&gt;Page explained Dartmouth had hurriedly given the answers to Parfitt â who is not permitted to speak on Ukip policy â on the phone, who had subsequently ""made an error and confused the words 'include' with 'exclude'.""

""For example, **if you're at a sidewalk cafÃ©, and you sit within 18 inches of a person who smokes two cigarettes over the course of an hour, your exposure to secondhand smoke could be the same as if you sat one hour inside a tavern with smokers**. Based on our findings, a child in close proximity to adult smokers at a backyard party also could receive substantial exposure to secondhand smoke.""

&gt;Unlike indoor tobacco smoke, which can persist for hours, the researchers found that outdoor smoke disappears rapidly when a cigarette is extinguished. ""Our data also show that **if you move about six feet away from an outdoor smoker, your exposure levels are much lower**,"" Klepeis added.

White asbestos or blue asbestos?  One is a lot stabler than the other and very easy to deal with, provides good fire protections and not that harmful compared to the other with tends to disintegrate in to dust over time.  It's that dust which causes the health issues.  

Removing blue asbestos doesn't require the full bunny suit, just a mask and eye protection because it's annoying but it will, unlike white asbestos, come back out in the solid chunks it was installed in. 

But you didn't know there were multiple types did you?  That's my point, people crusaded against ""asbestos"" people say ""asbestos"" but they can't quantify something as simple as which type is the one causing all the issues.

The reason? I'm not blowing my own trumpet but I simply do not judge - and work on the principle that my clients don't either. 

Whilst the IT industry is still sadly quite male dominated in terms of numbers - I've successfully placed several women in roles where they've either been given similar or higher salaries that they negotiated themselves (a couple of female graduates spring to mind, and one senior C# developer who negotiated about Â£3K more than the client was originally looking for). 

That's anecdotal evidence though, and I know it. But *as far as I know* none of my clients (or my recruitment agency) work to cap what women are on vs. men. Hell - some of the clients actually prefer female candidates to vary the team somewhat!

E-Cigarette vapour is **not** just water vapour. E-liquid is comprised of (varying parts) propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin (optional), liquidised nicotine suspended in a PG base and flavourings.

The vapour is comprised mainly of PG/VG, with trace amounts (magnitudes below exposure limits) of nicotine. [You can find more info on this here.](http://www.ivaqs.com/)

[There is no evidence e-cigarette vapour causes cell damage or death, unlike in cigarettes.](http://www.ecigadvanced.com/blog/study-no-evidence-electronic-cigarettes-cause-cell-damage-death/)

[While not completely harmless to the user](http://blog.casaa.org/2013/08/new-study-confirms-that-chemicals-in.html) (what is?) leading cardiologists recently revised their estimate of harm for e-cigarettes from 1% to 5% down to 0.1% to 0.5% harm to the user as smoking a tobacco cigarette. Yes, even the conservative estimates were 99 times safer than tobacco, more data has now put this at almost 1000 times safer.

I've been using electronic cigarettes for the last 2 years and I'm as certain as thousands of others that they can help a great number of people, that said, I am all for banning them in enclosed spaces, same as tobacco. HOWEVER, I would not legislate this. Allow it to be on a per-company policy basis. Your bar allows them? Great! Your dentists office doesn't? Tough. It's their call.

Fact is that many e-liquids leave a smell that - while nowhere near as repugnant as cigarette smoke - others may not find pleasant. I don't vape anywhere I wouldn't smoke, but some people do and they're just increasing the chances of ruining it for the rest of us.

I'd be happy to answer any questions at all anyone has on them, their compositions, or even starter kits.

1. you choose a corner and don't change your mind. 
2. Take a good sprint before that

4. Just place your shot accurate and hard with trhe inside of your foot.

Hazard does the opposite as in he choses the corner depending on what the keeper does (he'll chose the corner at the very end and change at the very last second if needed), the force behind it doesn't matter as much, he doesn't run approach with a short, good sprint and he doesn't necisarrily shoot with the inside of his foot.

I was watching the match today at a pub sitting beside my buddy who is a big Bayern supporter. We both grew up supporting our respective clubs. He was paying attention to his match, and I the same. We'd periodically tease each other about which team would score more and why we were going to win the champions league. Things were getting a bit heated between us but when Dom was getting subbed on my buddy quietly turned to me and asked who he was. I told him that he's a youngster that's come through our youth system and grew up as a Chelsea fan, much like we did. My buddy responded, ""And he's making his debut today at 17? In the champion's league?!"". As soon as he said that we both sort of went silent, turned our heads to the Chelsea match and just smiled at the TV.

It's a bit of a crazy idea, but I still think it holds some merit. Dom isn't just out there living his own dream, but the dreams of an entire generation of football fans that grow up wanting to play for their club. It was interesting how despite the colour of our kits this afternoon and our heated banter about the Munich champion's league final, my buddy and I were equally moved at how big of a moment that was for Dom.

It was a strange type of uplifting that we both felt. I suppose it helped that we're both at similar crossroads on our paths, but it felt as if we both stepped onto that pitch earlier today.

&gt; women debating politics were just 'sluts'

http://www.thefreedictionary.com/slut (see the second meaning). 

&gt;`2`. A slovenly woman

An old man used an old word to describe a room full of people for not cleaning behind the fridge. And the whole room laughed, including all the women. He was later dismissed from the parliamentary party because his comments had distracted the media's attention from the rest of UKIP's conference, which Farage had seen as a pivotal moment for them. Comments such as,

&gt;should not' send aid to ""bongo bongo land"" lest they spend it on ""Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments in Paris, Ferraris and all the rest of it""

Which were also poorly received. And poorly put, frankly, by him. But there is a debate to be had about what the money we send to some countries is actually spent on, developing countries tend not to have governments as open and democratic and transparent as ours (I know, right?).

&gt;businesses should be able to refuse service to women and gay people

My understanding is that UKIP sees itself as a libertarian party, and doesn't see it as the state's role to tell a business who they must serve. If a business comes out as not wanting to serve women and gay people, they can be sure they'll lose a lot more business than just that of women and gay people. Why not give the businesses that rope, UKIP might ask.

&gt;floods are caused by gay people

Said some random councillor somewhere in the middle of nowhere. Godfrey Bloom was at least a relatively senior member and close to Farage. I don't think this was picked up on when he was a Conservative councillor... Wasn't he thrown out?

&gt;Women don't have the ambition to get top jobs/are worth less than men if they've had babies

I don't remember a comment about ambition, but like the points I put at the bottom, maybe you know something I don't. I remember Farage making this point though - as I saw it he wasn't saying that women are worth less, but it is a simple fact that a woman is more likely to quit her job after having children than a man. They take months of time off work at the end of pregnancy and the beginning of their child's life. It's entirely right and proper for them to do this (it would be nice if it was more balanced), but it does make them less attractive to an employer, unfortunately. Farage was merely pointing out that he saw this attitude when he worked in finance.

&gt;sacking a member who supported gay marriage and another candidate openly calling them 'disgusting' and 'not normal'

This was the leader of the young UKIP group? They removed him from his position - but anybody holding an official position in a party who openly contradicts party policy at a time when it's a hot issue is going to get a dressing down. It's disappointing to see from UKIP, as they like to claim they give their members leeway with expressing their personal views, so it did surprise me to hear about this. But nothing really special. Labour would sack their president of Labour Youth (or whatever it's called) if he came out in support of the Bedroom Tax, I'm sure.

&gt;Setting up offshore tax funds whilst denouncing such practices

Is this that Farage has one? I don't know if they denounce it for individuals (let me know if they do), but it's not fair to compare personal tax avoidance of a relatively wealthy but hardly super-rich man, to the massive tax avoidance by international corporations. I've never actually heard UKIP talk about tax avoidance at all, though.

&gt;uniforms for taxi drivers, football clubs limited to three foreign players, trains repainted in traditional colours, making the circle line into a circle, greater freedom with MPs expenses (All from a previous incarnation of the UKIP Manifesto)

I think they did shoot themselves in the foot with their 2010 manifesto. But they say it's all behind them now, and Farage claims he didn't read it (I doubt this). It certainly makes it difficult for them to explain why they should be taken seriously now, when they didn't take themselves seriously four years ago. But they have grown into a relevant political force for general elections since then, and I think it's reasonable to start judging them based on the policies they released a week or so ago, rather than a manifesto they've disowned.

&gt;compulsory abortions for foetus' with physical/mental handicaps

` `

&gt;British Muslims should sign a commitment to abstain from violence

` `

&gt;sharing offensive images on social media sites and calling immigrants ""sandal-wearing, bomb-making, camel-riding, goat-fucking, ragheads""

I've not actually heard these ones - who made them? If it was similarly a nobody, then I don't think it's particularly important. UKIP have expanded rapidly over the last few years, and they unwisely decided not to spend their limited resources on vetting their candidates. I pointed it out at the time, that they would regret such rapid and careless expansion. I doubt any of the people who made those comments are still in the party, though.

-----

Going to piggyback on the top comment to make this point about the article. UKIP were very specific about getting one MEP rather than the whole party, but this article ignores that and goes into comments made by the leader who remains outside of the EFDD group, projecting them onto this guy. I don't know anything about Iwaszkiewicz, but one assumes they took a small amount of care about selecting which MEP to get. One assumes, also, that other parties in the group had to agree to this, but I don't know. In my opinion, the article shows a clear bias against UKIP (I am not a UKIP supporter, merely trying to replace one on this board). It's clear that it doesn't look good.

But frankly the rules over what you need to make a group in the EP are a bit silly. UKIP claims that Schulz sabotaged the party by asking the Latvian MEP who left to leave the EFDD group in order to lead her Kazakhstan thing. As the President (equivalent to Speaker) of the European Parliament, it sounds to me like quite an inappropriate thing to do. I have a lot of criticism for that man, like how he doesn't resign as Speaker while running for Commission president, is the leader of his Socialists and Democrats group at the same time... I would have voted Labour in the European Parliament elections, if it had not represented a vote for Schulz for Commission President.",0,1413942195,null,0,1413942789,0,clg5zmb,t3_2jvsuv,t1_clg5zmb,t1_clfk0sy,null,1426412777,0,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,0

This is comparable to the upfront, capital cost of buying a car, against the marginal cost of buying the fuel each week to drive it anywhere.

That means there's a big potential for mixing gas with other forma of energy. If gas costs 8p per unit to produce, and you can get an alternative source for less than 4p, but which is intermittent, then it is cheaper to switch the gas plant off than to keep it running, even though you've already paid to build it.

Obviously, the economics doesn't stack up at present, solar and wind are more expensive per unit watt than gas, not less than half, but it gives you an idea of how you can mix renewable and traditional power generation without simply paying the full cost of both.

Understandable.

&gt;As a result, her child benefits were stopped but she was ineligible to claim Jobseeker's Allowance because she was not deemed fit to work. 

This makes sense.

&gt;She was also told she did not qualify for incapacity benefit because she had not been officially diagnosed with a medical condition.

Why the fuck didn't she get a diagnoses then? Come on, they were capable of making a twelve mile trip to a food bank, there must have been a doctors somewhere within the 12 miles they could have gone to.

&gt;Mr Mullins was his wife's full-time carer. He fought to get a carer's allowance but was told he could not claim until she was diagnosed with a disorder.

As above, when an incapacity benefit AND a carer's allowance hinges on a diagnosis you go and get the diagnosis, you don't live like a fucking hobbit for 18 months hoping things will just magically get better.&gt;A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'The couple in question had been receiving weekly benefits from the department since February 2010 - these included money for disability and caring responsibilities as well as out of work support. &gt;We had not received any complaint from them about their benefit claim.'And this, kids, is why you don't read the Daily Mail.

It's worth bearing in mind that Labour have been in a grouping with Proinsias De Rossa, a man that was interned as a terrorist by the Irish government; Giulietto Chiesa, a 9/11 denier; and the Democratic Society Party of Turkey, who actively support PKK terrorists and their attacks on civilians. 

Meanwhile, this sub's much loved Green party were happy to be led by Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the man responsible for this lovely passage in his book:

*'My constant flirt with all the children soon took on erotic characteristics. I could really feel how from the age of five the small girls had already learnt to make passes at me. It's hardly believable. Most of the time I was fairly defenceless... It has happened to me several times that a few children opened the flies of my trousers and started to stroke me. I reacted differently each time according to the circumstances, but their desire confronted me with problems. I asked them: ""Why don't you play with each other, why have you chosen me and not other children?"" But when they insisted on it, I then stroked them. For that reason I was accused of perverted behaviour.'*

Maybe those who shout down the idea that Labour and the Greens are not terrorist-supporters and perverts will take note now.

Or maybe we realise that politics in some European countries are far more unsavoury than our own, and the European Union creates arbitrary rules to force our parties into unsavoury alliances with them in order to get any recognition in the European parliament.

These aren't ""fraudsters"" and are often difficult to catch, yet they attack the general principle of fairness and don't sit right with the public.

Part of the problem is that whilst billions are wasted needlessly, who is to say who is a malingerer and who is not? Who is to assess what disabled person is actually capable of work and should they maybe attend some sort of Work Capability Assessment so that an independent person can decide?

What if they get it wrong and cut a genuinely ill person's benefit or what if someone that doesn't want to work couldn't work even if they wanted to as they live in an economically depressed area?

Do you suppose that France or Britain would have a different immigrant population if they hadn't had a large empire during the 19th C and up to WW2? Do you suppose that there would be more or less Pakistanis had the UK not claimed India (and with it, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc)? Would there be more or fewer Somalis and Algerians in France? I wonder.

Anyway, enough speculation.

9% is, as you say, not insignificant. I think though that you are falling into the trap of assuming Eastern Europeans move to Western Europe just to claim benefits. I put it to you that they come to find work, but they are unable to do so. Hence benefits. What so many Kippers fail to note is the *efflux* of immigrants from the UK as well. There are plenty that come to the UK, earn some money (note: earn. Most often through work, rather than harvesting organs or whatever horrors you folks imagine) then head back. Not all, of course, but quite a few.

I lived in Thanet South. Soon to be Smiling Pint Man's new stamping ground. Let me tell you about Ramsgate. And certain areas of Ramsgate. The Newington Estate is made up mainly of council houses. The shops closed because they kept getting windows smashed. The pub closed after several break ins. A guy was murdered there, it made the national news. The nearest secondary school, formerly Conyngham before it became The Ramsgate School, was eventually made into an academy simply because the pupils there were all such, well, arsehole wanker types. The rest of Ramsgate avoids it like the plague. Staner Court, a block of flats, rarely gets police visits any more because the filth are unable to deal with all the calls.

The population of Newington is predominantly white British. There are many families that try to do something for themselves, try to ignore the wankers around them, but joblessness and poverty means that they can't get out.

My next door neighbours used to raid farms and steal red diesel, meant for tractors. They used to keep drums of the stuff round the back of the house. I dared not call the coppers because I knew that the young man responsible had a large family with a very violent history behind him. An anonymous tip would still have led to his dad and brothers asking questions. Again, they were white Brits.

I would say that many of these people, and similar communities, match the critera you are using to pigeonhole immigrant communities with. They are definitely shielding themselves from British values (what the blue fuck are those, anyway?), British laws, British society, and are about as integrated into the rest of Britain as a cheetah in a herd of zebras.

Your post has made me far more angry that I thought possible. My temptation is to smash my face into my keyboard in the vain hope that some coherent words might express my anger and loathing directed towards your post. But of course that's ridiculous.

What saddens me most about drivel like this is that Kippers generally refuse to clean shop before pointing a vicious, spiteful finger at, let's not beat around the bush here, non-Brits. According to local surveys most people in Newington, Ramsgate are more likely to vote UKIP if they vote at all. It would be funny if it weren't so sad. Kippers refuse to see that their voter base consists of communities *just like* the very ones you are vilifying, only that they are white Brits.

Right, you know, fuck it, let the hate flow though. I am sick to fucking death of whingeing, spiteful remarks about how Pakistani Muslims are responsible for raping white girls, simply because people like you, like YOU fail to acknowledge that there are child rapists who also happen to be white Brits. That fucking arsehole toerag cockmonkey Lost Prophet shitball Ian Watkins for one. Does the fact that he has a beard make him a Muslim too? Just for ONCE in your life, your miserable, curtain twitching life, think about the possibility that many white Brits do not match up to your bizarre notion of British Values or British Culture. There are many, many examples of immigrants ""living the values"" far more effectively than you or I. There are people who have arrived in Britain from all over the world that make a bigger and better contribution to Britain's society than you, I or Smiling Pint Man will ever achieve in our short, sorry lifetimes. There were Eastern Europeans who came to Britain in the 30s and 40s who helped win the fucking war, for chrissake, and you want to paint them with the same brush as some benefit scrounger?

Congratulations. If you were serious, or trolling, either way you have made me furious. After 40 years I hoped I was finally mellowing but you, yes, you have tapped into a rich seam of bitterness, bile and fury that I thought I'd lost. And I now direct it at the petty, small-minded, ignorant and prejudiced people that are willing to vote for Niggle Farrage, a man who is snuggling up to a holocaust-denier and nazi sympathiser.

They bring their fingertips to their foreheads when they miss. They run with arms outstretched when they score. They curse and spit when frustrated.

Do you suppose that there would be more or less Pakistanis had the UK not claimed India (and with it, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc)? Would there be more or fewer Somalis and Algerians in France?

Our immigration has primarily been from the colonies yes, not a bad thing. I would think that if our Empire was composed of different territories then yes we would have had more immigrants from them.

I don't agree with the idea that people move over here for benefits. Many benefits are outright denied to immigrants straight off the bat. I'm familiar with this after having been through the struggling that is living off benefits. I would never deny the fact that people come over here for work. What I would dispute though is at a time of high unemployment, we're taking in large amounts of immigrants who will snap up any damn job they can. They're a fair shade more desperate than me or you, given zero benefits so they'll work under minimum wage if they have to.

Asylum seekers however are given the right to claim benefits. There isn't too much stopping someone coming from a war torn hellhole and living here on benefits. Whether its a good idea or not to take in uneducated, unskilled people from war torn countries can be subjective. The idea of spending public cash to just take in people for the sake of it has to have a finite limit though. Are we at that limit? No idea, I have no clue on the amount of asylum seekers. 

You make a point of saying there's crime in Britain conducted on a large scale by white, British people. I've seen it first hand growing up on a council estate and been the victim of robbery, assault and other crimes a dozen or so times. I know full well how bad it can get. There was a time where I couldn't set foot outside my door without getting kicked in and almost always by white people too.

The communities that I am against are generally the hardline Islamic communities in urban environments, ones like Tower Hamlets. A similar case in Rotherham it would seem in regards to cultural isolation, where a large group of Pakistanis in the community have been directly involved in mass rape. The real issue here though is the proportion of people involved. White people rape others too, but not to the same proportion as there has been in Rotherham. There have been reports of similar cases in other cities around the country, I am sorry to say.

The child rapists such as Saville and Watkins are disgusting subhuman filth. You happy I'm condemning them too? It doesn't take away from the horrors of Rotherham when whites rape, it's just more unpleasant being aware of it. Just remember the proportions here. 1400 victims just in Rotherham, remember that.

Look at the frame where the top tube meets the head tube above the shifters. It's bent from a front impact. The top tube is welded into the lugs (red part of the head tube, not yellow) and that weld is really strong so the tube has failed, it's bent. The first few inches of top tube are bent, the joints might already have visible cracks but either way it's fractured and/or bent.

I could tell first glance as the geometry is now out, the front wheel is too close to the frame/down tube. It's a common problem (hitting the back of vans etc) but fortunately easy to spot.

This bike probably won't sell, the components look too worn and that frame needs to be avoided as it could injure someone if it fails in traffic.

This is a lie. Labour ran a surplus for most of its time in office. The debt and deficit came about largely as a result of the economic crisis, either directly, in bailing out the banks, or indirectly in the necessity of increased welfare to cope with the resultant unemployment and low wages. This latter is the reason the Coalition has failed to hit its targets: It has attacked the effect of the deficit (higher welfare payments) rather than the causes (inequality, low wages).

That's because you're missing out most of the argument.

Scenario: I go to university and acquire debt in order to get a degree.

Very frustratingly I cant find the article but there is a pretty compelling argument that with current technology solar panels in the UK will never produce more energy than they consumed in production. 

Solar panels are a great idea for other countries with more sunlight.

I'd much rather see our efforts focused on wind and water based renewables. We've got strong winds and huge tides so we should focus on these and invest in the technology. Leave solar panels to other countries where they have a better economic case and then let the technology trickle down to us when they're advanced enough to make sense economically.

Only some of it will apply to you and you will more than likely have plenty of time to prepare - due to the delay - to work out which sections are relevant. It's a good idea to highlight relevant areas to go back to. Get as much support as you can with your preparation (some areas will be able to supply you with a mental health advocate  to support you and attend the assessment with you.)
Concentrate on the medical areas that affect you most and if you can get your psychiatrist to phrase your difficulties in DWP language all the better. I know it's frustrating to wait but use the time to prepare a really good case with as much evidence as you can - phrased in the language they use.

http://www.gumtree.com/p/suzuki-motorbikes/suzuki-sv650-k3/1085672661
Higher miles but that wouldn't bother me as it looks to have been well cared for and that matters more! Lots of SV's ridden by idiots who use them as disposable bikes. 

As for pillion use. The CB500 might lack a bit of power. Anything will below 100bhp. 
My 74bhp ER6n's performance is seriously compromised with my 8st girlfriend on the back. It cruises fine but I lose that instant acceleration power and the suspension and brakes struggle a bit with just me, never mind 2 of us. 

So if 2-up riding is a priority concern, it would be another vote for the SV650 from me. It's a roomier bike than the ER, which is quite small.

false,IAmNotAmerican,cnty-expat,I don't belong here,"&gt; Equally, I think it needs to be mentioned that the UK is a much bigger, more powerful, more influential economy. Once we leave the EU we can make free trade deals to our advantage with anywhere in the world. At this current moment in time, the EU does that for us, and thus it is not to our benefit.

Aren't we a net importer of most goods though? Our manufacturing industry is very small, consequently our biggest industries are banking and media. I don't see us being able to negotiate on physical goods - there is no incentive for countries to give us a good deal as we have nothing of value to trade... except perhaps our influence, which will diminish if we leave the EU.

&gt; We can then consequently use our influence to increase trade with developing countries, which will not only reduce prices here as goods are cheaper, but also help those developing economies grow.

Yes, driving down prices on developing countries that are already scraping the bottom of the barrel will certainly help their economies grow and their people get out of poverty.

Increasingly I'm seeing the word 'influence' being bandied about like some kind of magic credit card that opens vaults.

It is a very risky gambit to bet all your assets on 'influence'. Last time I went to the bank for a loan, I don't remember any of their questions being how much influence I could use to pay back the loan if I ran into trouble.

The other thing about influence, it tends to have the opposite effect on those who choose to be loners.

false,MrFlabulous,,Glorious People's Republic Of Asbostan,"Fair enough. I guess both of us have not necessarily communicated completely effectively here. It just strikes me that given the overall conditions in Britain UKIP's targeting of immigration controls as the major policymaker has many issues around it. 1: Shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted. 2: Going after the lesser of two evils (the greater being the problems in white communities) 3: Populist. 4: Badly thought-out from a practical point of view and difficult to enforce.

My gut feeling is that (and I know this is a generalisation, I'm sorry) the right wing-inclined voters are more likely to blame the immigrant communities for Britain's problems than the Brits themselves, when really the bigger problem is the reluctance to address the problems that the Brits cause. It seems to me hypocritical to blame others when one's own housekeeping is poor.

I'm sorry for my earlier rant. I'm currently living in Sweden, and as such feel a greater empathy towards immigrants, being one myself. I find it far too easy to spring to action when I encounter anti-immigration talk.

false,domalino,logo,,"To be honest I'm mostly just annoyed at how bad we've been playing all season. When it ended I just felt ""served us right"". The team has been disjointed for weeks and eventually we were going to get punished. 

We aren't playing like a team. Silva has been great, Aguero, Kompany at times too. Dzeko has done some good stuff.

But its all been individual stuff.

Where is the type of fluidity we had last season? Aguero-Negredo, Nasri-Silva, Navas-Aguero, Fernandinho-Yaya. Through injury or bad form, they've all gone. We had players all over the pitch forming partnerships which tore people apart and 6 months ago we would have won that game 5-0 no problem.

I think the players look out of ideas all the time and we should shake things up a bit. Zabaleta has been great (as always) but I'd put Sagna in, along with Jovetic and start Lampard. We need some players who are desperate to impress and inject some energy into a way too settled and lethargic side. We pretty much know our first XI. Dxeko isn't worried about Negredo anymore, Fernandinho isn't desperately trying to get into Brazil's WC team and Yaya does't give a shit.

Our best performers have been Hart -who has got *real* competition, and Milner, who has been trying to get a starting spot in Nasri's absense.

We need more competition, and that will get rid of the ""Oh well, we're 2-0 up already attitude"". Instead they'll be merciless - Think Schurrle in the WC vs. Brazil.

This was stuff like my mother buying me a sandwich, as this altered what money we spent on food, my friend lending me a fiver til I got my benefits as this altered what we spent on a given week.

All reported of course via phone at a national rate, which you'd be put on hold for 30 minutes and told some person on the end who probably found his/her job crazy.

Me being me, I made sure I reported everything for ""buggerment"" or to some being an arse, I told them I found 10p in the street and let them know, my mum bought me a bag of crisps and I told them.

Your base salary is Â£14,000 or thereabouts. I assume you're on a permanent contract.

Tips wouldn't generally be taken into account unless you had three years of history (possibly 2 years).

You would be borrowing Â£86,250 from the mortgage lender and Â£23,000 from the government by way of equity loan.

Based on just the mortgage money this is 6x your salary. My gut feeling is that lending guidelines will mean that you won't be lent the money.

I would also double-check your budgeting. 

a 4% mortgage would cost ~Â£450pm, if the rates rose to 8% (not outside of the realms of possibility) this would become Â£650.

Working with Â£450, this leaves you Â£580.

* Council tax ~Â£75 (assuming band A in most places and single occupancy discount)
* Electricity/gas Â£50
* Water Â£20
* Phone/broadband Â£20
* Food bills Â£100
* TV License Â£12

These assume a pretty frugal existence and add up to a further ~ Â£400, leaving Â£180 (i.e. not enough to pay the mortgage if interest rates go up).

This is an uncomfortably low net disposable income and doesn't account for mobile phones, gym membership, cars, and so on.

I don't want to rain on your parade, but I would echo what others have mentioned: Rent for a while. Half your costs by renting with somebody else.

Renting isn't ""throwing money away"" or ""paying someone else's mortgage"". When you've bought a house, all the interest you're paying to the bank (which is the majority of your monthly payments in the early years) is effectively rent.

By letting you're offloading all the responsibility for the property onto somebody else, not limiting your options, and keeping costs low (i.e. the costs of buying and selling - conveyancing fees, mortgage fees, valuation fees).

Given what you've said about your job, you may find it's not a career for life, and that an opportunity arises elsewhere. With a rented property you hand back the keys and off you go, where-as if you own somewhere you have to sell it or try and let it out (against the rules with help-to-buy IIRC).

What harm is UKIP doing then that makes it so terrible for them to accept this man into their group?  And if you are so offended by this man's views, why is it only when he joins UKIPs group that you have anything to say about it? 

&gt;Just because EU is supposedly not enough democratic

What I said was that the principle that you need members from 7 separate member states to form a group is not democratic. It should be based on the number of MEPs in your group. 

&gt;UKIP would have taken all MEPs from that party but they knew they can't as this will be bad for their image, hence the clever choice of only the one from the party who is least controversial BUT the person is from that party anyway, hence he shares and supports the views especially of the leader of the party!

Exactly. Does that not prove then that UKIP does not share these views, and is only allowing this person to join so that they can form their own group? 

&gt;What do they need it for? After all, they despise the EU, not bother coming to the parliament and voting and are only interested in UK quitting the EU (not reforming the EU itself!)... It's for the purpose of paying for the campaign to quit the EU..... which again is completely hypocritical and without any moral values..... but UKIP in general doesn't have moral values, they just want to reach their goal, under any circumstances.

What a load of rubbish. Yes UKIPs goal is for the UK to leave the EU, and that's why they want the extra funding forming a group brings. Why is that hypocritical?

Why should a democratically elected group, who are opposed to the EU gaining any more powers, not accept money from the taxpayers who voted for them to help achieve their goals?

Over 4 million people voted UKIP in the EU elections. Those people pay taxes which pay for the EU project. Is it not fair that their taxes go to the party that they voted for? What is immoral about that?

It is absolutely not hypocritical in any way for UKIP to accept money from the EU. They are a legitimate party, with legitimate goals, voted in by people who expect them to work towards achieving those goals. To do anything else would be undemocratic.

2. The evidence shows the opposite. There is [no association between people who consume child porn](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/9/43) and people who abuse kids.

2. Freely and anonymously downloading a photograph is nothing like a market. No money changes hands. No incentives whatsoever are created for creating more photographs. In fact, almost all the child porn online is supposedly old photographs. Nobody is harmed by this.

3. Moreover, no crime need have been committed to create child porn. A child being naked is not a crime. A 13 year old having sex with an adult in Spain is not a crime. A 16 year old having sex in many jurisdictions is not a crime. Nobody has been abused, yet it's still CP.

Profit before ethics then? Still the same issue when taxi drivers are potentially loosing out on income for no other reason then thier skin collur. Using free market principles, If the company advertised a white-only service things would be different because customers would be in a position to decide wehrher to use them (and someone could open up a white-driver only firm to cater to that fucked up demand). But that they are conceding to that demand in a service that otherwise uses non-white drivers then its misleading to customers, especially those who wouldn't want to use that company as a result. 

Lets look it at it another way. A customer asks for a white driver but an asian driver turns up instead. The customer kicks off and a confrontation results. Is the company meant to take blame for that, or the driver? What if a customer complains that a non-white driver turned up at thier house? Is the companh then expected to make an apology? What if the drivers themselves complain? Is the company meant to say ""tough luck for having pakistani ancestry""? And what about white taxi drivers eith criminal backgrounds including sexual offences? Should they be disclosed to the customer on the call?

Fuck no. The company should be rejecting these requests because the company was not set up a a service provider for thos specific demand. Any other argument is pandering to fear, suspicion and discrimination, and failing to criticse the company for this is going to just pander to and promote wider sentiments in society. 

I worked for a business and if anyone called me and requested to speak to someone from a different gender or someone that had a different accent or was from a different place then i'd refuse to transfer them. If they had issues and refused my service, i'd ltell them they were free to phone back in the hope that they get someone else. But I wouldn't cater to that demand and i'd take issue with my employer (even if I was a self employed contractor) if they expected me to cater to that demand.

What next? People asking for a white worker in KFC because they fear that the black bloke on the counter is going to poisen thier food? Rejecting a bus because the driver is wearing a kipah? Refusing to let a white electrician into your house because he might be a white supremacist?

In a civil war where both sides committed atrocies and where the Kurds were fighting for their right to exist as their own people (e.g. Kurdish was illegal to teach in school and use in media for decades), saying that the PKK are 'terrorists who kill civilians' is completely misleading. That war reached a ceasefire in 2013.

The 'PKK terrorists' are now fighting in Syria against ISIS, and winning. They are the ones who've become famous for having female front-line fighters.

I'm talking about demand and supply though. Yes, masturbating in private doesn't hurt anyone else, but there's more to it than just that;

&gt; nobody is harmed by this.

Even by consuming *free* child porn, not paying money to anyone, hell, even if there aren't adverts on the page - it still perpetuates the child porn market. The fact that people look at child porn at all is an incentive for people to make more of it. And not all of them are even in it for the money.

&gt; A 13 year old having sex with an adult in Spain is not a crime

And you can't *seriously* believe that it could ever be ok to create and make available pornographic content of a 13 year-old? Do you think a child that young could have any grasp of what they'd be consenting to and bringing upon themself? Personally I think it's *very* dodgy that adults can have sex with 13 year-olds, but we're not in Spain anyway.

The act of having sex is one thing. Having that sex recorded on camera and the film potentially distributed is *completely* different and I'm astounded that you can rationalise ""CP is ok because the sex itself wasn't necessarily illegal"".

&gt; I'll tell you what does create an incentive to fuck children though. Preventing pedophiles from masturbating.

As for wings the best in Bristol in my opinion are at The Hobgoblin on Gloucester Road, especially if you like them hot. Gloucester Road is also generally a great place to hang out. Go down there one day and visit a couple of cafes. Job hunting and being by yourself on weekdays is pretty soul destroying. Any money you'll end up chatting to some random or another on Gloucester Road and it'll make the day seem brighter.

If your door doesn't have a letterbox the postman has two options:

1) return all your mail to sender marking it as undeliverable

2) try to deliver it, which is what he is doing at the minute. If he considers it secure then he is allowed to do it. If you don't consider it secure then that's a matter between you and Royal Mail.

Your landlord isn't going to mind if you stick a metal box on the wall or gate if he or she doesn't want a letterbox cut into the door.

3) UKIPs own positioning as the underdog and anti-establishment, not like other parties, is blown out of the water by this  (linked with #2 and #1) - UKIPs willingness to do this disproves their own rhetoric that the established political parties are simply there through inertia - instead of standing up for their own principles, they'll gladly throw in with some very dubious people in order to keep in power, which is exactly what theyve been banging on about labour or the conservatives, that they govern in a hubris laden manner.

false,pharao007,null,null,"&gt; And if you are so offended by this man's views, why is it only when he joins UKIPs group that you have anything to say about it?

I had enough to say about the whole party but because I'm not voting in Polish elections I don't discuss it more. I do vote in UK ones, hence comment more often about British politics.

&gt;What harm is UKIP doing then that makes it so terrible for them to accept this man into their group?

They accepted him is enough harm. Would you personally join a party, which you knew is totally against what you believe in? Or vote that party? People dropped their support of certain parties because of very silly reasons...... yet UKIP would probably go through dead bodies to reach their aim.

&gt;What I said was that the principle that you need members from 7 separate member states to form a group is not democratic. It should be based on the number of MEPs in your group.

And you are very wrong on this as this is actually very democratic! If you are planning on forming a European Parliament group you certainly need enough supporters from several EU countries, not only from one or two. That for example means that it is avoided for countries to make their specific organisations, like I don't know, Norway, Sweden and Finland only group, which obviously would advocate the most for their Northern Europe interests. MEPs don't have to form a party anyway, they can vote and act as independent, just like some MPs are.

&gt;Does that not prove then that UKIP does not share these views, and is only allowing this person to join so that they can form their own group?

Seriously, would you make a group if it meant you would have to accept a paedophile on it? I would not! I would prefer not to start that project at all, rather then sell my personal views and morals......

&gt;What a load of rubbish. Yes UKIPs goal is for the UK to leave the EU, and that's why they want the extra funding forming a group brings. Why is that hypocritical?

Firstly, the EU does NOT decide on UK's membership (whether they are in or out). UKIP should do that in the UK, not in the EU! If there aren't enough UK people who don't like EU, hence it doesn't get to the vote or the vote is for Yes to stay, than why EU should be a problem to that? After all Farage only claims how bad EU is for British interests, he doesn't even mention anything whether it's good for other countries or not as he's not interested in that.

&gt;Why should a democratically elected group, who are opposed to the EU gaining any more powers, not accept money from the taxpayers who voted for them to help achieve their goals?

Again, because EU money is for dealing with EU problems, not spending it on campaign to quit the EU. In fact, Farage is probably forbidden to spend that money for any directly UK MP election campaign etc.... so he either takes it out somehow or spends it on god knows what.

&gt;Over 4 million people voted UKIP in the EU elections. Those people pay taxes which pay for the EU project. Is it not fair that their taxes go to the party that they voted for? What is immoral about that?

You are again losing a perception here. Money for the EU is to do with dealing with EU stuff, NOT on getting the UK out of the EU. It's like I don't know, working in a university and taking extra grants from them, to fund your campaign to destroy them based.... and that based not on genuine reasons but very often on prejudice. If that Uni found out about it the person would be dismissed.... but the EU can't do that, because they are just too soft and too much liberal. I bet if Farage ruled EU, he would make strict criteria and simply throw such people away......

&gt;It is absolutely not hypocritical in any way for UKIP to accept money from the EU. They are a legitimate party, with legitimate goals, voted in by people who expect them to work towards achieving those goals. To do anything else would be undemocratic.

Their legitimate goals have nothing to do with the EU itself. They want for the UK to be out of the EU, they do NOT want to change the EU, hence should only deal about the issue on UK's national level.",0,1413978149,null,0,false,0,clggjzg,t3_2jyws6,t1_clggjzg,t1_clgftop,null,1426407706,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

Racist comments are racist whether they are said in an accent or not. 

There are loads of examples of people doing accents. e.g. comedians, anyone who sings country music does it in a country-American accent, and hip hop is often ""sung"" with an American accent.  BBC presenters will often switch to a French accent when pronouncing French words (I find that unnerving).

Sacha Baron Cohen made three major Hollywood movies where he disparaged particular racial groups *and* he also did this with an accent. He wasn't crucified for being racist.

Village Guards have been responsible for hundreds of extrajudicial executions, torture, kidnapping and even false flag attakcs.

You are taking a very complex decades-long conflict and distilling it to a simplistic narrative, that would reduce the PKK to its 'terrorist' activities, the DTP to 'supporters of terrorism' and Labour to 'friends of supporters of terrorism'.

They are not forming a party, they are an EU parliament group. Completely different. 

&gt;And you are very wrong on this as this is actually very democratic!...That for example means that it is avoided for countries to make their specific organisations, like I don't know, Norway, Sweden and Finland only group, which obviously would advocate the most for their Northern Europe interests. 

This is exactly why it is undemocratic. Individuals, or small groups of nations which have problems specific to them are unable to form a group. Why is it undemocratic  for Norway, Sweden and Finland to form a group if they feel their needs are not being met by the EU. Surely that is the definition of democracy. Why do they need members of 4 other states who do not share their problems to justify what they are saying?

The reason that there is growing calls for independence from the EU from many different countries is exactly this reason. The problems of individual countries are not being listened to. Individual countries have no power to fix problems that they face. 

&gt;Seriously, would you make a group if it meant you would have to accept a paedophile on it? I would not! I would prefer not to start that project at all, rather then sell my personal views and morals......

I think the issue is that you do not understand or are over inflating what it means to be in an EU group. There are no MEPs elected on the basis that they are paedophiles. So your question is irrelevant. You have not answered my question either. Does it not show that they do not share this mans views? 

&gt;Again, because EU money is for dealing with EU problems, not spending it on campaign to quit the EU. 

Says who? Its the taxpayers who pay for the EU. We own it, we decide what it is for. If millions of British taxpayers want to send their MEPs to Europe to point out its flaws and argue against it, then who is going to stop them? Can't you see how undemocratic that is? You are suggesting that there should be no room within the EU for people who disagree with it. That goes against all principles of democracy.

Are you really saying to the British public that the MEPs they elected are not allowed to work towards the goals they elected them for? Who are you to say that?

Would you say the same thing abut MPs in this country? If they are elected on the basis that the parliamentarian system we have is flawed and should be scrapped, that that MP should not be allowed to sit in the HoC and argue his and his constituency's case? 

&gt;Their legitimate goals have nothing to do with the EU itself. They want for the UK to be out of the EU, they do NOT want to change the EU, hence should only deal about the issue on UK's national level.

They are working at a national and EU wide level. There is more and more Euroscepticism across the whole of the EU, and the best way to make use of that combined dissatisfaction with the EU is for all of these groups to meet at the EU parliament and make their voices heard. 

You want the EU to be a echo chamber, where only people who agree with want the EU is in principle are allowed to e heard. Millions of people across the EU want things to change. And it is right and democratic that they be heard.

Regardless of whether or not piracy is a symptom of whatever is irrelevant: rights owners have restrictions on the consumption of their content and large swathes of people disregard that because they want it now and then use justifications like ""I have to work every day!"" or ""I don't like sitting through adverts!"" or ""That media won't play on my device of choice!"" when the correct response to those *problems* is... don't consume the content, consume some other content.

I'm not going to waste my breath telling people that piracy is bad or that they shouldn't engage in media piracy, but I will always find hilarity in people finding any number of excuses to try and justify their piracy.

So they get paid per patient they *potentially could* see, which is supposed to encourage them to see more patients, lower waiting times etc.

In practice it leads to the 5 minute appointments that most give, so they can squeeze most patients in per day. 

however due to government cuts / freezes over the past few years, they've seen a
&gt;reduction in funding of Â£450m over the past three years has been coupled with a 40m increase in annual demand for appointments over the past five [years].
([source](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jun/25/reduction-gp-funding-puts-entire-nhs-risk-bma-doctors))


[and from the BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-26703519)
&gt; GP funding across the UK at a nine-year low.
&gt;Between 2004-05 and 2011-12, the proportion of the NHS budget spent on general practice had fallen from 9.47% to 7.78% in Scotland and from 8.58% to 7.77% in Wales, it said.

what this means is GP's are *desperate* to raise money by other sources. This is why some now charge up to Â£80 for a 'sick note' , or for vaccinations when going abroad, or for missing appointments or anything else they possibly can charge for, in order to raise money.

They cant get rid of their admin staff / nurses , because this would increase waiting times and their contract with the NHS limits what that can be. ",0,1413981293,null,0,1413983484,0,clghe3j,t3_2jzgj0,t1_clghe3j,t1_clgh9kd,null,1426407316,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Did i say ""debating too much""? No. Dont put words in my mouth.

Debate =/= out spoken. Perhaps you should learn the definition of both?

&gt; Are you trying to argue we don't have 3 party politics?
THEY'RE IN A COALITION GOVERNMENT!
You're turning this bizarre.

Theyve been relevent for 1 political cycle (and that doesnt look like its going to last much longer) and somehow its 3 party politics.

Im fine with you calling it 2 party politics (because for the past ~100 years its been 2 party politics) but calling it ""3 party politics"" is very misleading when one party has only just emerged as a contender and has never even won a majority.

&gt; Nowhere have I given you cause to think that I was using EU and EZ interchangeably, so that's another bizarre thing to say.

the ""Euro crises"" is a eurozone problem, how have you managed to equate the euro crises to mean the EU in general? It has never been used that way and just shows how confused or misinformed you are about the whole thing.

&gt; It's laughable that you want to equate UKIP with Golden Dawn, when UKIP actively warned against it.

Its laughable that you are trying to deny that racists xenophobes and isolationists have not and are not within the ranks of UKIP.

&gt; It's responses like this that have propelled UKIP in the polls.

it doesnt make it any less true unfortunately for you.

&gt; Again, never said it was, but the EU is moving towards Federalism and ever closer union. You seem to think non-EZ countries aren't being pulled in.

we are a non EZ country and we have the best growth rate of any developed nation on the planet. Clearly the EZ is the problem and not the EU as a whole, how can you even begin to deny this?

&gt; To report to the UK electorate what the EU is up to.

That cant be done by say, more transparent groups such as the lib dems? I mean its not like UKIP are a beacon of transparency and rightousness, you do know about the Â£400,000 that Nigel stole right from UKIP right? Amongst other things like un-declared free use of premises and not registering to the electoral commission. Such a trust worthy guy!

&gt; They're protecting British interests and using its own resources against it. Smart.

Explain to me how not voting and not turning up is ""protecting british interests"" when they dont engage or share their concerns with the parliament?

&gt; Only they do turn up, when it is right for them to do so. There's nothing wrong with the analogy. You're complaining about an independence party not behaving like good little Eurocrats. Of course they don't.

I dont mind them being an independence party, they bring up some valid points and i do want the EU to change. HOWEVER, they dont help me you or anyone else in Britain by making a nuisance of themselves, detracting from debates and generally providing un-constructive ""feedback"" e.g. Farage calling herman van rompuy a damp rag (it maybe funny and true, but not what i want to see in the EP)

&gt; I'm pretty sure the UK pays in more than it takes out.

We could debate this for an incredibly long time before either one of us changes our mind.

&gt; Nope. There is no desire for further powers to go to the EU.

Again, conjecture. Im all for a federal europe, therefore i could make the claim that there is very strong desires for further power to Europe, of course i know its conjecture but you seem to think your opinion is the truth?

&gt; At best people want it to stay the same. Unfortunately (or fortunately for me) there is now a European Union Act 2011 and the EU desperately needs more reform to tackle the ongoing crisis. The two are divergent.

I would actually say that people want reform of the EU more than they want to leave it.

&gt; Not been paying much to the ESM, have you.
In fact it sounds like you haven't been paying much attention since before Lisbon, or didn't listen to the presidential debates.

Please tell me you know what fiscal union is, the ESM is not fiscal union, its a bailout fund for failing countries and i dont really know how this relates to our discussion.

&gt; The WTO.

Yes we are a member of it and so is every EU country, whats your point?

&gt; Not with Free Trade Agreements we're not. There's a Common External Tariff. The EU's a custom union. It's protectionist.

Urrm, almost every country applies external tariffs unless they are in a free trade agreement (that is one of the benefits of a trade agreement). Yet more evidence that you have no idea what you are talking about.

&gt; 90+% of UK trade isn't with the EU (80% is domestic). 

WOW, you just equated internal and external trade as the same thing when debating trade agreements. Im actually laughing at how dumb you are making yourself sound right now.

Here is a list of our main export partners for you:

 Germany 11.3%,
 United States 10.5%,
 Netherlands 8.8%,
 France 7.4%,
 Republic of Ireland 6.2%,
 Belgium 5.1%

(all but one are from the EU if you hadnt noticed).

&gt; All UK business must currently use EU regulations, however clumbersome.

Almost all EU regulations are for the benefit of the consumer, society in general or the environment, i know its hard for you to believe, but the EU isnt some fairytale monster that is pure evil, it has benefits whether you like to admit it or not.

&gt; We could reduce SME regulation and let those that trade with the EU continue to do so using EU regs

But in order to operate in the UK they would have to abide by UK regulations, and if they wanted to trade with the EU theyd also have to abide by EU regulations.

Thats 2 sets of regulations just to trade with the EU, that increases costs dramatically.

false,pharao007,null,null,"&gt;They are not forming a party, they are an EU parliament group. Completely different.

Nope. A group, organisation, a party, pretty similar things. If you group with someone in whatever way, you share views of that group/party/organisation.

&gt;This is exactly why it is undemocratic. Individuals, or small groups of nations which have problems specific to them are unable to form a group.

But they do NOT need to be part of specific group to be heard. Being in a group means they get extra funding and I think Farage gets to have a seat more to the front (lol).

&gt;Why is it undemocratic for Norway, Sweden and Finland to form a group if they feel their needs are not being met by the EU

Firstly, my mistake, Norway is not in the EU ;)

Secondly, because the EU is supposed to act for the good of all EU countries. If by any chance, some rich and big EU countries, let's say Germany, France and UK made such group, they would have extra funding and too much power (due to them having most of MEPs), where they could only seek improvements which would be only good for them specifically, giving no chance to other countries to be heard. Also, maybe because to limit the idea of forming a group from specifically one country, even with different parties, so that they would get extra money because they formed a group ""UK-only"".

&gt;The problems of individual countries are not being listened to. Individual countries have no power to fix problems that they face.

You are putting too much power into EU, which doesn't have that power. Don't forget the EU deals mostly with international issues within the EU. For specific countries to deal with their own problems is for their local governments to do that. Seriously, sometimes people misunderstand the EU by sooo much.... but that's what listening to Farage and right wing papers leads to.

&gt;There are no MEPs elected on the basis that they are paedophiles. So your question is irrelevant.

I was giving you a specific example to make it more black-white. Yes, MEPs who were/are paedophiles are not elected (unless it hasn't come to light yet) but apparently you can say some very weird political stuff and still remain an MEP or even MP.

&gt;You have not answered my question either. Does it not show that they do not share this mans views?

Dude, really. When you join a group, you automatically become part of that group. It's not talking about a group of ""white people"", or group of people specifically with English heritage or whatever. It's a political group, which they made/joined and if their members have some totally weird views they usually are not let in - hence Farage himself throwing away some people from his party for that individual's views! So please don't try to defend it using that basis as the same time forgetting about the latter.

&gt;Says who? Its the taxpayers who pay for the EU

Taxpapyers pay for certain things, not for fun of politicians. Money spent for the EU is specifically for EU budget, not advocating for the UK's British exit.....

&gt; If millions of British taxpayers want to send their MEPs to Europe to point out its flaws and argue against it, then who is going to stop them?

But that's exactly what you are missing here. Farage does NOT want to change the EU. He only acts in a way to harm it..... even though it cannot make Britain exit from the EU from within the EU's parliament. If you don't like the group, just quit it, not meddle with it inside. It's highly immoral.

&gt;Can't you see how undemocratic that is? You are suggesting that there should be no room within the EU for people who disagree with it.

NO! I'm saying (look point above). Farage attacks the EU on nearly everything. They even voted NO for some very decent changes, like saving some animals..... because it was their ""protest vote"". Like they protest voted to show their behind when EU's hymn was played. That's not only immoral but completely pathetic. Just like hooligans shouting and swearing when other group's hymn is played.

&gt;Would you say the same thing abut MPs in this country? If they are elected on the basis that the parliamentarian system we have is flawed and should be scrapped, that that MP should not be allowed to sit in the HoC and argue his and his constituency's case?

Again, you are wrong. Farage is NOT interested in Europe and the EU. He only acts for Britain's sole interests. UK needs some form of government in any case, hence being in government and wanting to change it would be pretty normal. Being in government and wanting to totally disassemble it from within would only make sense if that government had serious issues (but that doesn't mean it couldn't be CHANGED, hence making no case for total disassemble). Or if you were an anarchist and didn't want any government at all..... but that would make you hypocritical as you joined a body in which you don't believe.

Above all means that if Farage wanted to change the EU, even drastically (but NOT fully), he would by all means remain in the EU parliament. But Farage would prefer destroying whole EU.... and in fact quitting it as as he has said himself, the UK would have no problems whatsoever by not being part of the EU.

&gt;They are working at a national and EU wide level. There is more and more Euroscepticism across the whole of the EU, and the best way to make use of that combined dissatisfaction with the EU is for all of these groups to meet at the EU parliament and make their voices heard.

Hence, they can form a group to be wider heard. 7 countries out of 28 is already a pretty small number but if they can't even get that 7 countries then simply maybe there isn't enough Euroscepticism in Europe??? There was enough in the UK to win EU elections and if that really is a case, then it should also be enough to vote for UK government which will lead to EU yes/no vote and if there is enough of them, then the UK would quit the EU and that's it.

If Farage decided later that he still thinks the EU is bad and he somehow started to care about other European countries then he could advocate for that from Britain.... but since the UK would not be part of the EU, it wouldn't have much to say.
