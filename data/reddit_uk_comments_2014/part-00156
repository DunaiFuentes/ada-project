To amplify, it is more than many people in Brighton or Birmingham have per month, and they are alive.

You can easily find a small apartment in Brighton for about £800 a month. You can easily feed a couple for about £200-£300 a month, as long as you are careful shoppers.

I know a few postgrads who are on less than that and they do ok. Come to think of it I've lived on less from time to time.

Your biggest expenses will be rent, and if you're anything like the academics I know, books.

People who think £2k a month isn't enough are possibly assuming a far more expensive lifestyle than necessary. Consider that most unemployed people get around £80 a week, plus most of their rent paid. It's not fun but it's not forever.

Its highly unlikely you're going to get an apartment by doing a 'security deposit under the table' and most of the time they either want you in employment or you have to have a guarantor. (Someone who will by law guarantee to pay the debt you cant pay) And AFAIK most jobs sort of do require a home address so you're in a bit of a catch-22 here unless you can prove you have at least 6 months worth of rent and go for a 6 month lease.

Still not too expensive). And if he doesn't make the cut, we'll move him on for a reasonable fee, maybe around the £9m mark as his age means he still holds value.

true,SuffragettePizza,null,null,"You could definitely live on that in Birmingham, probably fairly comfortably, depending on where you choose to live. 

My partner and I live in a nice suburb further out from Birmingham and our joint income per month is just under £2000. We spend roughly £1000pcm on essentials (mortgage, bills, food, our dog but no car) and still have enough money to put away savings each month and go out occasionally. However, our mortgage is pretty cheap. For reference, when we were renting but in a cheaper area, our outgoings were £1200pcm with rent of £525pcm. 

Depending on what you want from your home and where you want to live, you could definitely support yourself and your wife on £2000. In our suburb an unfurnished 2 bedroom flat by the station will cost you from £550 - £700pcm. However, you could rent a nice 3 bedroom house for that much in other suburbs like Erdington/Gravelly Hill. City centre is definitely more expensive, so your money will go further if you move into the suburbs and get the train into town. The trains are pretty regular, every 10 minutes from roughly 7am - 11:30pm (can't promise they run on time though!) and fairly cheap. My OH pays for a monthly pass that covers him for trains throughout all of the west midlands and he pays £85 every four weeks for that.

Let's just get this straight; I do think he's currently our best option at right full back, but I don't think he's good enough. I hold the same opinion on Skrtel. He's been our best CB this season without a doubt, but I still think we can do a lot better. 

Us fans get sentimental about players, but I hope Brendan doesn't. If a fair offer for Johnson he should sell him immediately. I'd rather we play Flanagan and Wisdom at right full back while freeing up a lot of wages to perhaps sign another great player (100k a week is what you pay for world class talent).

true,mikejonas,null,null,"You mention the ""knight-errant""; I for one would consider Doctor Who more akin to the knight-errant trope than Star Wars.  You have your knight, with his companion squire, wandering from place to place and (usually inadvertently) finding wrongs to be righted.  It's a timeworn, universal format, whether it's Sir Galahad or Don Quixote or a Chinese Wuxia or the Enterprise Crew or the A-Team or Michael Knight and KITT.  Make the hero clever, witty and with a heavy touch of braggadocio, and give the show a truckload of in-jokes and a healthy disregard for the rules, and you've got Doctor Who.

If you've only seen the first two and a half seasons (of New Who, I presume), I think one thing that might be throwing you off is the production values of the show, which, compared to Trek and Star Wars, is on the shabby side, especially early on.  I remember when I first tried watching DW thinking to myself, ""man, this show does have a lot of cutting to reaction shots rather than showing whatever cool thing is supposed to be going on.""    This gets better with time, and definitely improves by the time Eleven gets on board in Season 5. 

Still, compared to American Sci-Fi, DW is still more talk and less action, but IMO that's part of its charm and flavor.

Anyway, if Seasons 1-3 haven't been to your liking, perhaps you can try Season 5.  I know there are many detractors of the Eleventh Doctor episodes, but I think that for some prospective fans it may make for an easier jumping-on point.

It worked out for us in the end and we dealt with the bad press and moved on knowing we were in the right all along...with the added bonus of having our best player have the best season of his career right after.

If the press want to turn against Southampton, that's fine by me. But I don't think it will change their position on the matter.

for the first 7-8 years i was interested so phoned every year or two - they could offer me television but no broadband or phone (but i'd still have to pay for the phone side because ""it's in a package"" if you got the tv). i only wanted the internet part.

eventually! one of my calls was fruitful - they'd enabled whatever it needed to do the phone part so i could get one of their packages - unfortunately now they were significantly more expensive because i *had* to get tv from them - they'd stopped doing just phone and broadband.

i gave up at that point and asked them to stop sending me letters. they stopped for a few years, all was good.

a year or so ago they started again but with fortnightly letters and i put up with them for a while but eventually got pissed off at the waste of time and resources of them delivering them and of me throwing them in the bin and rang to ask them not to. this was fruitful in a way - the letters now said ""the occupier"" instead of my name on the first line. for a while i scribbled out ""the occupier"" and wrote ""not at this address"" and put them back in the post, because i thought it was funny.

i've called twice since then and they always promise me no more letters but i still get them on schedule every 2 weeks. i filed a complaint with ofcom mentioning that i'm on the mail preference service but seems like nothing they can do.

part of me wishes i'd kept them all, i've never felt so wanted.

It might make things a bit easier to know that you can go back and fourth quicker if you intend to be there for at least a few years.  Canada has a great Healthcare system and is a primarily English-speaking country.  Also, (in my experience) Canadian slang tends to be a bit easier to pickup on than English slang.  If you have rudimentary knowledge of French your chances are much, much better for qualifying for their entrance rating.  If you know *no* French, picking up a language book and trying might not be a bad idea but I don't know what kind of time scale you're on here.

* Seeing as you have dual citizen, are either of your parents former or current Military members?  I know of a lot of people who were born on ships and whatnot overseas that were granted dual because of it, especially in Germany due to the Military bases in that country.  If you do have any family members that are retired or active duty, you may be partially covered by their insurance plan.  The VA hospital ([link](http://www.va.gov/directory/guide/division_flsh.asp?dnum=1)) may be able to at least steer you in the right direction if you are related to a Military member in some way.

* It might not be a great idea to write off Germany entirely right away.  I don't know their current economic climate, but it is possible there is some kind of shortage of English proof readers, teachers, tutor, etc. that you might be able to pull off temporarily.  It couldn't hurt to pay a visit over to /r/Germany and ask for a better perspective on the issue.

* You mentioned needing a double mastectomy, so I am assuming that this is breast cancer you are dealing with.  Have you spoken to a [cancer crisis line](http://www.webmd.com/cancer/cancer-helpline) yet?  Rack your brain and think of a bunch of questions/fears/etc. that you have right now that haven't been answered by any doctors or medical staff yet, write them down, then call one of the listed numbers.  Here's the contact info for breast cancer specifically:

I mean, come now, even a Time Lord must understand that Bacon is the beginning and the end of the ""best things in the universe"" list), I still wish I would have had more time with 10.

9, however, I love for more than just nostalgia. I love 9 because 9 was the Doctor who learned to love again. And that is a personal story/transformation I can wholly identify with. 

I think, when I really boil it down, there is never enough time with any of the Doctors. But that's part of the charm of the show. Just like a companion, our time with the Doctor is magical, wonderful, and entirely shorter than we may hope. This does not diminish the Doctor, by any means. No, it serves to enhance our time together, making it all the more precious. 

EDIT: I almost forgot. The smile. 9 had, hands down, the best smile. It was this infectious grin, like someone discovering all the wonder in the universe all over again, for the first time. It was simply fantastic.

true,TorontoRed,null,null,"Istanbul was actually the first game I ever watched, I was nine at the time and didn't really follow football so my two brothers, one a Liverpool fan the other a Chelsea fan convinced me to follow whomever won the Semi final. So when Liverpool won I was expected to watch the final with him, so on the day of the final I went to my mothers house to watch the game with my brother. Sitting in the living room are 12 of his friends all wearing liverpool shirts (His Milan friends weren't invited). When my brother saw me he said, ""you can't go in there looking like that"" so he hands me his old fowler shirt. So here I am a nine year old girl sitting on my brothers lap surrounded by 10-18 year old guys feeling really awkward and plain weird. My brothers being massive football fans always talked about football everywhere they went, so when the game started and I saw Harry Kewell in the starting lineup I was confused, the only time my brother mentioned Kewell he used the word shit the same sentence, I thought nothing of it and just continued watching. 

Then the first goal, ""don't worry we'll come back"" someone said, ""still 90 mins left don't worry"" was the sentiment, I continued watching, Crespo 1 then 2, all of a sudden it was 3-0.  you could feel the tension in the air. no one said a word during half time. everyone looked so jaded and depressed. My brother was gripping my arm the entire half, and his finger nails were digging into me. The look on his face was so sad, he honestly looked like he was about to cry. So when the second half started everyone was still so somber, the atmosphere was alien to what it was before the match. then it roared again when Captain Fantastic scored that header. my brother shouted ""C""MON YOU BASTARDS SCORE AGAIN!"" , but the excitement quickly died down as we realized that were still 3-1 down. Then came Vladimir Smicer. The noise was deafening. my brother shot up and threw his arms up, not realizing he was holding me I flew into the air a good three feet. I screamed, everyone thought I was shouting for the goal but I was terrified. luckily my brother caught me and I fell to safety, everyone was laughing their ass off after that display and I decided to sit next to my brother on the recliner instead of in his lap for the rest of the game (I'm glad I did). 

After Vladi's goal the atmosphere changed completely, there was the nervous tension in the air, and I got sucked right into it, I was watching every pass, tackle and move like my life depended on it, I started to really want Liverpool to win. For the first time I was into a game, emotionally invested, I became a liverpool fan at that moment. Then came the penalty. I was screaming at the TV for the foul on Gerrard and how that's not fair. My brother and his friends just laughed at my outrage (I didn't realize a pen was given) and told not to worry as were going level this game. So up steped alonso and my nerves were on fire. when dida saved I was so angry, I shouted, then the rebound. Buried. It was surreal, the group exploded the players mobbed Alonso, the house was going to blow, everyone was screaming and hugging, by brother picked me up and put me on his shoulders. Then they all started singing, I sang too, I don't even remember what we were singing. (probably some on the spot song).

 Then came the most nervous moments of my life. from 3-3 all eyes were completly glued. We were so tense I probably lost five years of my life. then came extra time, the madness of Dudek's double saves and then penalties. It was a blur miss goal, miss, goal, goal, miss, goal, goal. then came Schevenko, one of my brothers friends was like ""if he misses we win"". everyone held there breath, he stepped up, hit it and...... saved. It didn't register at first, we win? we won? did we really? we won. we WON! OH MY FREAKING GOD WE WON! then I was screaming and dancing, jumping down like a lunatic, little 3'11 me, going crazy. my brother picked me up and I was being tossed by his friends, up and down, they'd catch me and hit me back up. It was madness. We were all standing, I was on my brothers shoulders as the trophy was presented. the shit eating grins on everyone's faces was priceless. The rest of the day was mental. we went back to my fathers house and my brother and I annoyed hell out of my other brother, singing we are the champions long into the night.

Vast quantities of statements and evidence from *both sides* are often ruled inadmissible by the judge. Trying to guess the outcome of a trial based on evidence that was ruled inadmissible is a pointless exercise.

Oh, and ""Millionaire hires incompetent defence team"" is not a story you hear often and frankly is a pretty feeble excuse. 

EDIT: Correction, the statements were not ruled 'inadmissible' but appear (if we believe the website linked above) to be unused material. So, this means that it cannot be that the prosecution 'prevented' the statements from being used but that the defence team decided not to use them. This could have been for many reasons, they could have undermined other elements of the defence, they could have duplicated other statements and so could have been irrelevant, the character of the witnesses could have been such that the statements would have been useless. Frankly, we have no idea, it could have been something else entirely. But to read them without the wider context of a trial is utterly futile and for the website to present them so that

Regardless of the competition he has he can really only get his numbers up when he's given a shot, which he has done - but the quality of the opposition is an important consideration. Based from numbers off of WhoScored it seems like he played a total of 365 minutes against teams that finished in the top half of the table. That got him 2 goals and 2 assists. While the rest of his 417 minutes (4 goals) came against bottom half opponents. He only notched up 86 minutes of game time against the rest of the top 4.

That suggests his stats may be more favorable since he didn't get to play in some of Bayern's bigger games, infact with only 782 league minutes to his name it can even be argued that he was a lot more fresher and even motivated to play as hard as he could.

Lallana meanwhile clocked up 3086 minutes  appearing against every opponent; and while yes given every opportunity to shine also, also meant no breaks which given his established high work-rate makes for an impressive feat.

true,IAmNotAmerican,cnty-expat,I don't belong here,"I kind of agree with you, however under the surface I think may be more than that.

I come from a low income background of the afore-mentioned immigrant-hating class, however I used to love meeting people who were from abroad and hearing of their culture and background.

It wasn't until much later in life I was fortunate to travel and see some of these places first-hand. That, and having been occasionally subject to foreign xenophobes whilst abroad, broadened my mind to see that there's so much more to the world and that we're all just people trying to get ahead in life.

You have no idea how much it depresses me to see so much anti-~~immigrant~~people sentiment these days. Even trying to reason in this sub you get downvoted - though I am a bit extremist - I'm for no-borders whatsoever.

Then there's the blanket ignorance of the UK's history and the reality that we are reaping the result of 100's of years of empire rule. The fact that we basically invaded almost every country on the earth, installing our own values, system of government and culture - ironically the very thing we exported for hundreds of years we now fear happening to us (well I don't, personally, I love embracing new cultures).

The empire may be waning, but the attitude does remain - Imperialist - in that it's thoroughly ok that we invaded other countries and imposed ourselves on them - because our culture was/is better - but that does not mean they get to do the same.

I'm sure I'll get some more downvotes for saying this and I'm sure someone will comment and explain how all that's the past and it's not relevant now and that being concerned about immigration is not imperialist (it's not, but it's a symptom of our cultural inheritance).

I think fear plays a large factor too as an underlying cause of anti-~~immigrant~~people sentiment - fear of losing out to something you consider a birth-right (right to a job in your country of birth, right to property in your country of birth). I think many of those of higher income have realised that in order to be more successful in life, you have to decouple yourself from some of those entitlements.

Ironically enough, those people who strive for a better life the most, are the ones who are prepared to give up all entitlement their birth-country has given them (or fled when they didn't want to) in order to carve out a better life for themselves in this world - immigrants to the UK, but also migrants FROM the UK.

Something James Altucher said once was that the American dream was a marketing campaign to make people buy houses and settle down. If people take root in an area it's easy then for companies to lower wages, because of the reluctance to move.

There's something about being reluctant to move or migrate connected with lower wages - whereas those who are prepared move and to lose everything, have an opportunity to gain higher wages and more freedom.",0,1401702748,null,0,false,0,chx2d03,t3_271rs7,t1_chx2d03,t1_chwnjhn,null,1434057496,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

In fact, the system was stricter than what you describe *before* the Coalition came to power.

But because of ignorance of how immigration works, and the fact that extra-EEA immigration is the only sort that can be controlled, each successive government make it harder for non-EEA citizens to immigrate in order to satisfy the public. Of course, the public won't be satisfied until we somehow nullify free movement in Europe.

When it comes to marriage and family reunions, it was easier to come in under Thatcher than it was under Labour in the 00s. Other types of immigration outside of asylum have been cut off unless it is temporary, you are a multimillionaire, you work in a shortage field, you are a graduate or post graduate, or a couple of other paths. You are background checked every step of the process. Your access to benefits outside of the NHS is limited before ILR. Even the NHS is limited for non-settlement visas. I am not saying this is right or wrong; it's just how it is whether the press will tell you it or not. 

I am not arguing against free movement in the EU or pointing the finger of blame at it, but every time I hear someone proposing an ""Australian style"" system, it's like fingernails down a chalkboard.

true,yumineko,eng-hertfordshire,Hertfordshire,"How it has worked for a while, despite actual rule changes for non-EEA spouses of UK citizens are as follows:
1)The relationship must be genuine and subsisting
2)The couple must have a place to adequately house themselves and dependants
3)The non-EEA spouse and any non-British dependants must be able to support themselves without relying on public funds (if they are successful, they will have a visa/residency permit stamped with ""No Recourse to Public Funds"")
4)The couple must plan to live together in the UK (there are exceptions for military and diplomatic families)
5)There are restrictions on types of ""unspent"" convictions. Like if someone has some minor traffic tickets, they probably won't have a problem, but has to declare the convictions. Things that are more serious will more than likely have to be spent before an application will be successful. Convictions that can't be spent will probably mean that someone cannot come as a spouse.

Those are the basics. There was a language/Knowledge of Life test before people became permanent residents. Now there are language requirements before the initial visa as well as a new KOL test. There used to be a pretty basic formula of what it took to satisfy the no reliance on public funds based around income required to claim benefits. The Coalition raised the income requirement to basically middle class levels [assuming it is based on a single income] and have it based ~~solely~~ *usually in practice* on the British spouse's income or a massive amount of savings. The Coalition has also lengthened the period of temporary residency which has led to the sort of ridiculous situation where under nationality law a spouse of a UK citizen would have qualified for citizenship (if they actually held permanent residency) a couple of years before they qualify for ILR.

Statements like this annoy me, because they buy into a consipiracy that there was some devious plan to let in all the West Indians to ""undermine"" ""English culture. 

I believe it was largely unintentional, but there was at least one New Labour minister who said there was a deliberate intention to ""[rub the right's nose in diversity](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/6418456/Labour-wanted-mass-immigration-to-make-UK-more-multicultural-says-former-adviser.html)"". I'm not too bothered either way, the fact is that many English working-class communities were supplanted by the policy, and a lot of people are pissed off by that.

&gt; This also absolves the press of the responsibility it has in creating and engendering a climate of fear. **The Press as much an influencer as it is a listener**, this was proved by the way PMs and prospective PMs sidled up to press barons such as Rothermere. If you look at Labour's response to the asylum seeker hysteria of the late 1990s int he Mail and other papers in setting places like Yarls' Wood and restricting asylum seekers' rights it's pretty obvious there is a ling between the commotion generated and the response. 

There really is no substantive evidence to support the assertion in bold. The press can, and indeed do, influence policy, and as evinced by the Maria Miller debacle can get a minister sacked, but only if they reflect public will. No amount of Guardian campaigning would get the monarchy abolished or the church disestablished, for instance. The people who hold your view tend to believe tabloid readers have no critical faculties whatsoever, but I've yet to meet anybody who believes everything they read in the press.

As for the era of press barons, it has long passed. Indeed the influence of Fleet Street is generally on the wane. Murdoch was cosy with Blair, but not so much with Cameron.

I am an emigrant from the UK, but that was for love not any other reason. But I also work with lots of different cultures and nationalities in my job. And you can see the different work ethics from around the world.

Filipinos are great. I've never seen people work as hard as they do, and I'm pleased to say that I can class some of them as friends, and if I ever get to visit the Philippines, I will hopefully get to visit them.

Egyptians on the other hand, are like yes-men when at a low grade, but then tyrants when they get some power. And if you are working for them, they don't like to listen to ideas or experiences from someone below them.

Both are due to the culture of the countries where they are brought up. I know it's anecdotal and so not great evidence, but similar to the UKIP furore a couple of weeks ago, if someone told me I had a choice of Egyptian or Filipino neighbours, I know which ones I would pick.

Would I say the culture in the UK is the best? No I wouldn't. But I would say it's a damned sight better than quite a lot of cultures in the world.

No. It's nothing like a conspiracy to create an enemy. The actual reason is very, very simple. The British people have repeatedly expressed uncertainty about immigration and the government have been accused of having open doors and the UK being a ""soft touch"". Therefore, the government promised to reduce immigration numbers, period. However, EU immigration is still rising and the UK is absolutely powerless to prevent it because of freedom of movement within the EU. So the only way to get the TOTAL immigration numbers down is by clamping down harder on non-EU immigrants.

This is my exact problem with the current system. It is insane that anybody from the EU can come here, for any reason, usually just for the money to send home. Yet a skilled person such as yourself who was willing to settle and make a home here has such a difficult time. The current system is actually pretty fucking racist if you think about it.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"You're missing the point about the ""mass immigration"", the areas you underlined and pointed out were areas that became the homes for large populations of people from West Indian or South Asian backgrounds. 

This took place in the 1950s to the late 1970s. This is why the debate about ""mass immigration"" is dishonest. People make the same mistake you have - conflating different eras and waves of immigration into one phenomena. 

The use of the phrase ""mass immigration"" is also the an interesting one because again it highlights the powerful role of the press as *infleuncer*. 

&gt;There really is no substantive evidence to support the assertion in bold.

In ""The Influence of Mass Media and Interpersonal Communication on Societal and Personal Risk Judgments"" by Cynthia-Lou Coleman(1993) we see evidence of people's perception of risk being influenced by the mass media. 

In ""Reinforcing Spirals: The Mutual Influence of Media Selectivity and Media Effects and Their Impact on Individual Behavior and Social Identity"" by Michael D. Slater , 2007 we see that media influence is part of what people, especially those with a perception of vulnerability, use to inform them of the social reality. 

Famously people like Weber, Powell and Di Maggio, Giddens point out that the society has a structure of legitimacy that is created , in part, by the institutions that are supposed to act as gatekeepers - the press being one of the key ones. 

Take those these points of reference to begin with then one can clearly see that a) the influencer role of the newspapers is evident b) that people's perceptions are impacted by that role  and c) the process is iterative in that perception can be both active and reactive. 

So the question has to be asked , if the words ""mass immigration"" are being used and are oft repeated the newspapers, then used by the TV outlets, then repeated by Politicians.. what does it actually mean? 

Surely it has become an amorphous concept used as a carrier of insecurity and fear, rather than any defined reality.  

For some it's the West Indian and South Asians who came over in the 1950s to the 1980s, for some it's the EU workers who come over, for some it's the recent arrivals , for some it's asylum seekers. 

Your own contributions are a good demonstration of this - you've conflated asylum seekers , EU immigration and the long run patterns in immigrations into one general discussion about immigration. 

Isn't this just proof that you're reacting to the agenda setting by newspapers that you so forthrightly claim doesn't exist? ",0,1401707013,null,0,false,0,chx338e,t3_271rs7,t1_chx338e,t1_chx2mzx,null,1434057840,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

""UK research suggests that immigration has a small impact on average wages of existing workers but 
more significant effects along the wage distribution: low-wage workers lose while medium and high-paid 
workers gain.""

So on average it probably does increase, but for those at the bottom, they feel it more.

It does also mention studies by the people you mentioned and studies which have the opposite conclusion too.

It doesn't matter how critical to the company you are if the company doesn't have the money to give you a pay rise.  Costs are up, sales are down and the banks aren't lending money.  In this case it comes down to staff accepting that they're only getting a small pay rise this year (or none at all), the owners having to accept that they're not making any money this year (or having to invest further), and/or the company going to the wall and everyone losing their jobs.

That's how it works in the private sector, particularly during a recession.  Sure, there are huge multinational companies raking in mega profits and still treating their staff like shit.  I'm all in favour of employees standing up for their rights in those case.  But there are also lots of smaller business operating on tight budgets and barely managing to break even.

I've had plenty of jobs where I've thought I perhaps deserved a better pay rise than I got, but the choice was always clear: accept what they're offering or go elsewhere.  It seems fair to me as both an employee and an employer.

Someone with a good idea for setting up a shop can't just rent out an empty shop for a week or a month, to see if the idea works, they need a lot of capital to start, and that high barrier to entry excludes many of the start-up retail businesses which might otherwise make local high streets interesting and different.

&gt; have a very basic network of HS railways, and replace the rest of the railways with roads would be a good compromise

HS will free up major lines such as the West Coast for an increasing amount of rail freight. Considering the base level benefits of rail freight vs. road freight, you can see why this is good.

Also consider the width of some train lines vs. that of major roads (motorways etc.). Once you get out of the city centres where all lines come together, railways are much thinner. So to replace rail with road, discounting all other benefits and drawbacks, would require purchasing additional land for the roads. For example, two lanes each way plus a hard shoulder.

Granted, time is showing that people were wrong to complain about the big fees for Henderson and Allen, but for many others they were right (Carroll, Downing, Aquilani etc.).

As for times when we didn't spend enough… It seems pretty obvious to me that we wouldn't have come anywhere near the title this season were it not for a big stroke of luck in January 2012, when we made two absolutely boss signings in Sturridge and Coutinho. Who else was there of Sturridge's quality, age and price who would be willing to come to a non-Champions League club in January? Pretty much no-one, that's who. Massive props to Brendan for signing those 2, but we got lucky that they were both available and not wanted by rival clubs; the fact is, in almost every other window in the last 5 years we have failed to sign forwards/attacking mids of their quality, arguably by not spending enough cash on the likes of Sigurdsson/Mkhitaryan/Willian/Salah etc.

It's very simplistic to say that our only problem in chasing these quality players has been a lack of spending, but equally it's simplistic to say that it's only because of a lack of Champions League football, considering the string of quality signings that non-CL Tottenham made last summer with their Bale millions.

true,mr_rivers1,null,null,"Its an interesting idea, but there are a few problems. 

First off, you can't reliably keep a bus running at 70mph for long periods. They're not really designed to go that fast, and the amount of fuel usage campared to a streamlined train would be massive. 

One of the biggest advantages of trains over buses is the fact you can have a hell of a lot of people get on and off them quickly. Imagine trying to fit a thousand people into 30 buses; you can do the same amount with 5 trains, trains have multiple entrances and long platforms for egress, whereas each bus would have to pull up to the platform individually. It takes significantly longer to cram a bus full of people than it does a train. I would say it takes the same amount of time to fill up one bus as it does an entire train with far more people. Plus that train has room for all their luggage, toilet facilities, room for bikes (eco) ect. They're also more reliable if the weather stays good; they reach their destinations within a few minutes generally without exception, whereas buses have to stop at each stop and it can take a random amount of time to load and offload passengers. 

You can essentially get far cheaper travel, with far better greenhouse emissions, carrying far more people, for slightly more expense (it would go down if the networks were improved). 

I would be interested to know what the difference in maintenance is between tracks and roads, but i would imagine it is easier to keep trains running on time with tracks reliably, as they can go on different tracks right next to the maintenance, whereas the buses would be slowed down considerably. 

The only real downside to trains is their cost, but if we had the infrastructure in place, then these would weigh out over time compared to maintaining a fleet of buses and the miles of road needed to carry them.

Finally, my town centre runs a free bus to the transport hub from various places around, and a free bus to the next town over.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"This response is a perfect example of the rote catechisms of the neo-athiest right that seems to have found a handy way of assuming essentialist superiority and pretending to be ""progressive"" in the same breadth. It's quite handy double think that turns up in these threads and is quite easy to dismiss. 

The accusation of  shutting down debate or ""close the thread immediately"" is typical of this stance. 

Rather than acknowledge the complexity and nuance that is involved in analysing a society and admitting that there are complex factors that lead to a society where it is - we get this: 

&gt;But anyone who criticizes backwards cultures and practices can now immediately be dismissed as ""bigots"" by apologists / revisionists such as yourself with no further discussion.

No, what can be criticised is the immediate reach for the word ""backwards"" and the construction of a dichotomy that doesn't exist.  That there is an ""us"" and ""them"". That there is ""our culture"" and ""their culture"" , that there is ""our society and their society"" - indeed that there is ""backwards"" and the there is by implication a ""forward"". 

The dismissal of your views and Gomez's views as being ignorant come directly from the literal application of the word.  They come from identifying you lack of knowledge of a) how societies socially construct their reality b) that societies are reflexive and iterative

The accusation of bigotry comes from the constant pride you seem to have about being ignorant and the wilful, sometimes angry and desperate attempt to hold on to those essentialist views - despite the wealth of academic evidence that shows both a) and b) happening. 

If you were interested in debate and examining your knowledge and your criticisms came from that place, then what would happen is that the discussion would have more detail, nuance and an acceptance that you don't know certain things. However, that's not what is demonstrated. 

Let me give you an example. You keep using the word ""backward"". Do you understand the social history of that word and how it was used? Are you aware that when the advent of colonialism , the idea of ""progress"" and ""retardation"" was as much a social construction? 

Do you even know that the word ""enlightenment"" itself was used in order to create a clear division between the rationalist modernity of the 16th century onwards in direct political opposition to the old monarchies that rule by Divine Right?

Thus the idea of ""Progress"" and ""backwards"" is a political term that denotes not only the superiority of a racial group society.  

If you can acknowledge that and move on from that into a moral discussion, then fine. But a conversation without a knowledge of those social realities is ignorance in a suit of bravado.

&gt; Depending on what you want from your home and where you want to live, you could definitely support yourself and your wife on £2000. In our suburb an unfurnished 2 bedroom flat by the station will cost you from £550 - £700pcm. However, you could rent a nice 3 bedroom house for that much in other suburbs like Erdington/Gravelly Hill. City centre is definitely more expensive, so your money will go further if you move into the suburbs and get the train into town. The trains are pretty regular, every 10 minutes from roughly 7am - 11:30pm (can't promise they run on time though!) and fairly cheap. My OH pays for a monthly pass that covers him for trains throughout all of the west midlands and he pays £85 every four weeks for that.

You practically Godwinned the thread. Who are you kidding? You use words like ""racist"" and ""bigot"" precisely to avoid discussion of those issues, because you have no arguments, only ad hominems. You do not seek discourse, because that would involve facing up to hard truths.

&gt; No, what can be criticised is the immediate reach for the word ""backwards"" and the construction of a dichotomy that doesn't exist.

Genital Mutiliation, Honour Killings, Death for Apostasy, need I go on? or are you suggesting those practices are perfectly acceptable and fitting within our society, because heaven forbid anyone should lose their cultural identity and move into the 21st century?

No, I'll just wait for the usual justification that it is ""cultural and not religious"", completely ignoring the fact that their culture DEFINED their religion, and their religion now enforces their culture. One and the same for all intents and purposes.

Search for ex-pat insurance rates for appropriate companies. 

Remember too that automatics (manual) are pretty rare there too so if buying 2nd hand (used) cars you'd better be able to drive stick. Uk driving test is harder mostly because it actually tests you as opposed to ensuring that you didn't crash during the 15 min casual jaunt they do in the  US. Your US drivers license will let you get an international driver's license from AAA but will only be good for 1 year.

Cost of living oop norf is way cheaper than London. Especially housing but most things are more expensive there. Especially food and fuel but the gas mileage is way better on newer cars in part because they're smaller. For food you can save money by buying food that has been discounted.

true,HorriBliss,,"I don't really like sausage rolls too much sure, so fuck yee'z!","Not sectarian but racist/religious prejudice, aye.

My Da is Pakistani and my Ma is English, but I've been raised here since I was two.

Had the full she-bang: chased in the strets; windees done in (at the peak it was 36 weeks out of 52 we had at least one window done in (usually it was two)); Ma got beat up once; metal poles chucked at us; C-18 spray painted on our house; car window done in, lots more, I've just forgotten them.

Our primary school principal was a fucking saint.  He never tolerated any racism and he was genuinely one of the best leaders/community members I've ever seen.  Made us (me and my three brothers and two sisters) feel just like everyone else.  Lovely, lovely man.

Secondary school the first words someone said to me was: ""Paki bastard"", but it got better.  And I even went to one of those posh schools, fuck sakes!

I would share a few more stories but I've work at 4 and I have to leave in a few minutes, I'll write what I can though:

- One time me and my brother were walking down the Lisburn Road toward town.  We would've been 8 (him) and 6 (me) when there was a group of boys following us: they were about 14-16 I'd say.  They were all: ""What football team do youse support?""  And I genuinely didn't know what sectarianism was, but my brother was like: ""We don't like football"" then whispered to me: ""Get read to run"".  That's when we heard: ""GET THE PAKIS!"" and we bolted it tae fuck.  I think we ran to Avon (is that it's name?) and asked a man for help.  He gave his baby to his wife, and pulled a base-ball bat out of his car saying: ""Take one more fucking step and I'll kick your fucking face in"" to the lads, told us to carry on, and we ran home.

- One time we were playing football in the house and kicked it through a window.  Ma was pissed, but we just said someone threw a bottle at the window.  *hehehe* 

- A brick was chucked through the windee and landed two inches from where my sister was sleeping in her cot, so that was kinda scary

And before I bounce.  Despite living in a very Loyalist area I don't feel threatened by Pastor McConnell's comments.  People who've never liked us show it, and those who do, are dead-on.  I don't feel any more 'scared' than I ever was.

Aye, so hopefully that's what you were lookin' for.  Gotta go work 4-9/10pm, lucky me!

Sick note dated 2nd May. Had been previously told that the doc won't backdate sicknotes, so I figured as the two day gap was bank holidays, they'd let me off, right?

Nope. I had to spend two days running around, getting a sick note to cover the missing time and having it emailed to the DSS for processing. I got my original, May 2nd note in in good time before my payment was due. The first indication I had that something was wrong was when my payment didn't turn up. Phoned them, got told my claim had been closed because of that two day gap. I got it all sorted and my payment was only a day late.

I don't think anything I'm about to say can help your present situation, and for that I'm sorry, but for future reference, some of this might help. Of course, your first recourse should be to phone ESA and double check that my advice would work in your area. I live in Birmingham and things could be very different where you are.

First off, sending the note late: Some jobcentres will offer to email your note to the DSS. If you call ESA and ask them to arrange an AJAX appointment at the Jobcentre you used to sign on at, all you'll need to do is turn up with your note. It's emailed and received and processed the same day. Also be sure to have it put on your notes that you need a same day internet payment. Basically it's a BACS payment and goes in sometime before 5pm. 

This is certainly something you could call them about today and have arranged. It takes five working days for them to receive and process a posted sick note, then it takes a further three days to send you the payment through the normal route. Arranging a same day payment will speed that up.

If your surgery is being an ass, you could see if they offer internet appointment booking, or change your GP. You don't deserve to be treated like that and I've seen a few GP's going over to this ""Emergency appointment or fuck off"" system and it sucks. I'd be changing my GP the moment they even suggested it. The receptionist is not a medical professional and should have no place in your diagnosis or assessment.

While some undoubtedly are arseholes, bear in mind that the majority are just regular people forcing their way through another shitty day at their horrendously shitty job. The frontline staff you talk to are not the ones who make the rules, but they're the cannon fodder that get all the fallout. hence why some of them are....prickly. It's not you they're mad at, it's their bosses.

Most of them really want to help you, but they're told that unless you use a certain form of phraseology, they're to refuse anything. It helps to learn what they call certain things and how to ask for emergency help in ways they can accept.

Increasingly, with the current sanction culture at the Jobcentre, it's getting more and more prevalent that their first insistence is that you mooch off friends and family.

I originally visited that site because I made a joke at the expense of handsome footballers and rape culture - when I had seen the interviews with the girlfriend previously, I thought to myself ""poor lass, she's just deluding herself to stand by him"", but having read pages and pages of that site, I was fairly convinced of his innocence.

You're right that the jury have spent more time at this, and the point of justice is to defer to them, but I think you're pretty wanky if your claim is that lawyers and juries never get it wrong.

Miscarriages of justice are a real thing, and we should care about them. 

I find the website pretty balanced - it does not merely show the guy as a beacon of innocence, and there are exactly the kinds of incongruities I would expect.

Add to your list the democratic argument. That is the biggest reason imho.

Because we've lost that policy power concerning the EU there is a valid argument here. Each point is variable of course, but definitely open to debate. But you neglect the biggest.

Second you neglect the global picture: [Immigration: the push me-pull you equation](http://www.eureferendum.com/blogview.aspx?blogno=84979)

&gt;*On the day that Home Secretary Theresa May signals a ""tough new line on EU migrants"", we see a separate report that there has been an ""eight-fold increase in the number of illegal migrants entering Europe"".*

&gt;*There lies the ultimate nightmare for policy-makers, those who have to deal with real world conditions, where there is a trade-off between official and illegal immigration. Clearly, the more ""liberal"" the official policy, the less of a problem the ""illegals"" present – and vice versa.*

&gt;*Arguably, in terms of numbers, it may be (but is not always the case) that your illegal immigrants are fewer than those who would be attracted by completely open borders and open access to public, etc., services, but there comes a point where small numbers of illegals can be more resource-hungry, in terms of enforcement requirements, and more intrusive (in terms of the type of policing and services provision) than legal immigrants – who will contribute to the open economy.* 

&gt;*What very often decides the level of inflow, though, is the balance between the so-called ""push"" factors – which turn settled populations into would-be migrants, and drive them from their homes – and the ""pull"" factors which attract them to one or other country, and not others.* 

=

&gt;*And it is here that we are seeing both EU intervention leading to massive policy failures. For instance, member states are funding a US$41 million mission to help Libya better secure and manage its borders through the EU Border Assistance Mission (EUBAM). However, the mission, now entering its second year, has been severely constrained and has achieved almost nothing.*

true,Treesclera,eng-norfolk,Norfolk,"You only need people moving around *by foot* along the pavements. Usually this happens because people are shopping but the shopping part isn't necessary. Pubs, theatres, cafés, plazas, museums, parks etc. all work just the same. But you're right, having a 'town centre' is very important to feeling part of a community and to feeling happy and safe. This mainly comes in the form of seeing people you recognize in the street (and thus not isolated, which is why cars don't work) and also knowing that if anything happens to you (mugged, raped, heart attack etc.) that someone will be around to witness/stop it/phone the police. 

The main way in which we manage this is through the idea of permeability. The more places you feel that you can pass between, the more you feel like you're in a safe and comfortable environment. Which is why a shopping arcade with many doors feels wonderful but a tunnel feels dangerous and uncomfortable. As long as we have high streets where people can pass to and fro (without having to pay for entry or without requiring keys etc.) we'll still retain what we enjoy about being in a town.

The problem is that the little shop is going into a nuclear war armed with a baseball bat. They can't compete on price, and neither should they be expected to, so they close down. But... Is brutalising the little shops to the detriment of the big shop? It sort of is. Take my local town, there are two supermarkets in my town centre- since they have been there, lots of other shops (grocers, butchers, fishmongers, 3 bakeries, numerous clothing stores, a book shop, two indie record places) have all gone. I'm not saying it's the supermarkets fault, but the music store I worked in certainly couldn't sell chart CDs at £7 a pop. There are now much fewer consumers going to the town centre, and the supermarkets are limited in size due to the nature of the shopping precinct layout. That means that people go to the out of town, purpose built shopping centre if they can. Profits are down for the supermarkets.

That's why I suggested that there should be that symbiotic relationship- say the butcher has a little space rented from the supermarket, you can buy your premium, speciality or quality meat (eg. Xmas Turkey, Easter lamb, odd stuff like tripe and mongoose, or whatever) there. The supermarket benefits from the footfall increase and sells complementary goods, and has enough product line that ""oh, whilst I'm here, I'll just pick up..."" occurs. They still receive the profit on the meat that gets sold, but their cut comes from the rent, and it could theoretically increase their profit as they get the sale without having to deal with the supply.

Why is it better? Well, the consumer gets more choice, the smaller businesses are supported with things like cheaper rent because the big business is now invested in their success rather than their destruction, and the big business gets some easy profits to line it's pockets.

true,Ultach,,Ballymena,"I've never really felt comfortable identifying as a Christian at all, though I believe very strongly and try to involve myself in the faith as much as I can. When I was growing up I always saw people professing their Christianity very openly as a way to feel superior to people who didn't, and I guess because I'm afraid of coming across that way I keep it to myself for the most part. I felt as tenacious about my religion as they did, I think, but I didn't want any of the snobbery or political baggage that came with it.

It's not been all bad, though. I was able to find my own faith, instead of inheriting one from my parents or something. I was able to disassociate my political beliefs from my religious ones very easily. And I suppose because I didn't have any friends I could discuss matters of faith with, I ended up reading a lot about theology and the history of Christianity, so maybe in the end it worked to my benefit.

true,DarkSayed,null,null,"&gt;even with that many buses, there would still be nowhere near as much traffic as there is on motorways with private vehicles on

There also would not be as much space. Consider the width of a rail track compared to a motorway. 

&gt; Traffic is caused mostly by human error, braking too soon, slowing down too much, accidents, things like that.

All these things would still happen on a dedicated road. 

&gt;As for you doubting they would be cheaper to build and maintain? a double decker bus costs about £300k, a single rail carriage costs over £1m and that rail carriage does not carry 3-4 times as many people as a double decker by a long shot. as for maintenance, how many people in this country are qualified to maintain a standard tyred vehicle as opposed to those qualified to maintain a train? and how much more money do those train engineers cost compared to mechanics?

A proper comparison of cost would have to take into account many things: How often you need to buy new stock (1m is not bad if it's good for 20 years). Maintenance cost of road vs rail, fuel/power running costs, total staffing costs (drivers and traffic control). 

Perhaps the most crucial point is that fossil fuels are a dead end. The future is electric, and on that front, electric vehicles technology is far behind rail. We have an impetus to invest in rail now more than ever before. Petrol and Diesel will soon be prohibitively expensive.



Finally, a rail journey is more expensive than a bus journey, and a carriage more expensive than a bus, but you are also getting something that can travel 50% faster.

If you're Muslim, for example, there are Muslims everywhere but most towns don't have a mosque. Unless you want to travel to worship, you may want to stick to a city.

Transport can be a big issue in the UK.

true,UncleDuster,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"Hi, thanks for the reply. I'll try and address your points one by one.
&gt;what do you think is dubious about the information on the website?

I think the 'key and undisputed facts' section is quite sneaky. A large portion of it comes from the defendants statements and testimony. It is presented as 'fact' as it is in the form 'he said ...' or 'according to his evidence .... '. However, we get none of the cross examination of this evidence. In this way, the 'key and undisputed facts' section is effectively the defence's case - only one side of the argument. 

With only a cursory reading it also appears to try to minimise elements of the evidence which would support the prosecutions case. Compare it to the reporting in [this BBC article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-east-wales-17677969). Note how the night clerks evidence of the victim being:
&gt; ""extremely drunk"" and said she was stumbling and slurring and occasionally grabbing hold of Mr McDonald to steady herself.

 is shown as 
&gt;He also said that she looked drunk. 

It also changed 
&gt;he called someone on his phone to say he had ""got a girl""

Into 

&gt;Clayton sent a message to Ched saying words to the effect of ‘I am with a girl'.

Radically different stuff. Obviously, it could be the BBC article that is wrong.

&gt;I think you're pretty wanky if your claim is that lawyers and juries never get it wrong.

Absolutely they get things wrong and miscarriages of justice do occur. However, they are the exception and not the rule. Evans has already had an appeal rejected by the appeals court. Perhaps he will appeal again and perhaps it will be upheld. He certainly has the luxury of having the money to spend on further lawyers and 'specialist investigations companies' that most of us do not. However, I seriously doubt that these additional statements are the smoking gun that you think they are. His original defence team rejected them for a (unknown to us) reason. Incompetence is only one explanation for their rejection of evidence and in my mind a very unlikely one. 

&gt;So how can you say ""beyond reasonable doubt"" she didn't consent?

I can't. But I am willing to trust the jury who have seen all the evidence that she didn't. If the jury made a mistake, then I would expect an appeal to be upheld. It wasn't. If there was grounds for a further appeal, I would expect it to be lodged, reviewed and granted. It hasn't been. 

In fact, in the 10 months that his 'specialist investigations company' has been reviewing the case we have had heard very little - nothing in the last 6 months. Due to the funds available to his defence, his case has had *far more legal scrutiny than any case involving you or I would have*. So I'm fairly confident in this verdict.

EDIT: [The rejection of his first appeal](http://ukcriminallawblog.com/2012/11/28/ched-evans-appeal-refused/) appears to show that most of your key points were covered by the appeal court judges, considered and then rejected.

At Liverpool, Lambert may not have consistent playing time and with the limited playing time, there may be increased pressure to try *too* hard to score goals for his boyhood club and not just relax and play his game.

All that being said, the two most recent times he came off the bench (3 May @ Swansea; 15 March v. Norwich) he scored a goal.

And, y'know what? I'll bet he gets a lot more playing time than we think.

Christianity (and religion as a whole) is not only an extremely outdated concept but also a lie, throughout history its held back just about every part of human development it could have and continues to because people swallow the nonsense they're fed as impressionable children (myself included).

Christians such as Robinson are quick to critise the koran and the muslim faith, but the bible is not immune to what most consider evil acts such as;

the killing of men and boys, keep virgins ([Numbers 31:13-18](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+31%3A13-18&amp;version=NIV))

the killing of men, women, children and infants ([1 Samuel 15:2-3](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+15%3A2-3&amp;version=NIV))

the laws of Rape ([Deuteronomy 22:28-29](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+22%3A28-29&amp;version=NIV))

Slavery ([Exodus 21:20-21](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus+21%3A20-21&amp;version=NIV), [Ephesians 6:5](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+6%3A5&amp;version=NIV))

Killing of Homosexuals ([Leviticus 20:13](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20%3A13&amp;version=NIV))

No doubt any christians reading these texts are doing so for the first time, these passages are simply not used in church teachings for obvious reasons.

If we extracted and used all the fossil fuels available, the resulting effects from climate change would render most of the world uninhabitable. We'd probably kill of enough of our own species to that we wouldn't ever be able to reach that point, but I'd prefer we realise this before killing billions.

When the fossil fuels available become unprofitable without tax breaks, this is a good point to give up trying to extract them and switch to renewables instead. Trying to keep fossil fuel extraction profitable by lowering taxes is madness.",0,1401725071,null,0,false,0,chx90p1,t3_273p07,t1_chx90p1,t1_chx6m5a,null,1434060700,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

I'm glad we're doing business early, but I'm also aware of the little noted fact that of our signings in recent history, only Sturridge and Coutinho have been unqualified successes. After that you've got Mignolet and Sahko as having proved something but not enough to be deemed great successes. Then you've got Allen, Borini, Aspas, Alberto, etc, who have done nothing to yet to prove their valuations.

I just have to wonder how much of this happiness emanates from some sort of sweet spot between a player being enough of an unknown quantity, young, from a better side in Spain, for a larger fee but not too large, and not a fee that seems to be dictated by a bidding war.

Like, if the initial story said we bid 12 million euros (based on LFC's evaluation of the player) and then we ended up paying 22, would we all still think it was such a good deal?

That's a comment I don't actually understand. What do you mean here - that we have finite slots for people coming into the country? Are you arguing limits of population density? Because both conceptions are a bit misguided - we don't have limited slots for population size in this country and we won't theoretically reach unsustainable levels of population density for quite awhile - we're not even the top European country for population density and we've a got long long way to reach levels of places like [Hong Kong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states_and_dependent_territories_by_population_density).

&gt;I am talking about EU citizens moving here and claiming benefits that they are then legally entitled to, or EU citizens moving here with aim to commit crime. 

Again this is two separate categories with all sorts of classification issues. Not to mention that there's an assumption problem - that people are coming here to commit crime or to claim benefits.

Playwrights near the cathedral can be good sometimes.

For coffee in town try Sovranos- their mocha is particularly good

Pubs wise the place is awful (and even worse for clubs - do not go to the Kasbah unless you want  your own safety compromised- the staff there have been known to take disregard customer safety and satisfaction in favour of selling fake/watered down drinks at an attractive price).
The only pubs I can even slightly recommend would be the Establishment, Whitefriars and the Windmill. I'm sure there are other good ones but it means taking a leap of faith when walking in (you don't want to end up in the Diplomat, the Oak or Impulse for example).

If you like trying different beers maybe try Inspire (in a church spire near CeX) but it's a little pricey.

As far as there being an Arsenal match thread that was biased, you need to realize that once biased threads became a reoccurring problem, rather than a few isolated incidents, is when we decided to start removing them.  A few isolated incidents is not enough to make us implement a new rule right away.  It takes a reoccurring problem and a discussion before we do anything.

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt; An a conversation where ad hominems are used in place of rational discourse is an exercise in futility.

Then don't start with it and you won't feel so put upon. 

&gt;[Snips rambling apropos to nothing ...]

It's fair , I think to observe that though you have the opportunity to understand how society works and the concept of social reality - but you choose not to take that path. 

I gave you a concrete example of how words have meaning and power, especially when you use them to frame the moral framework that presupposes certain things. 

I could have the same discussion with you about the use of the word ""Freedom"" in the US political arena and it's historic use by different groups to achieve certain things. 

&gt;No, I'll just wait for the usual justification that it is ""cultural and not religious"", completely ignoring the fact that their culture DEFINED their religion, and their religion now enforces their culture. 

Let's take this apart too. Considering it's a bit confused. 

Firstly, the state you seem to think identifying why something happens is the same as justifying it. This is an error in thinking. You arrive at the place you are right now because of social influences and much as your own rational or irrational cognitive processes. Indeed , there's plenty of evidence that your cognitive processes are influenced by your context. 

So, let's say I find out that Mr X, who has lived in Kentucky all his life under the influence of  Quaker family. Mr X then refuses to volunteer for the draft in an upcoming war. 

At this point stating the fact that Mr X, who has been living in the social context of Quakerism and this may be an influencing factor his pacifism is not justification of his pacifism. 

If Mr X joined the war and killed the tyrant. The stating the fact that Mr X's social context of  Quakerism is at odds with his behaviour is not justifying Mr X's.

In both cases what we're doing is trying to understand how Mr.X and his surroundings influence the world around him. We are looking into Mr X's reality, both his unconscious processes and short term processes.

The same can be said for history and society. Let's take the idea of ""Great Britain"". We know that it was formed as a political unit in 1707. We also know that it was during a time of sectarian conflict and different ideas of governance and Monarchical claims. In 1707 those social context affected what Great Britain meant. 

By 1792 and the Napoleonic Wars, the idea of Great Britain became something different in opposition to the Regicide and the Republicanism that rose through out Europe. If you read Jane Austen you can see this in the conservative nature of the world she portrays. If you look at the elevation of Nelson as war hero, and Wellington's post-Waterloo eulogies. There's Britain that has moved on rapidly to something else. 

These observations aren't judgements. They're an attempt to understand the nature of how that society came about and what it means for those people within that situation.  

Secondly, culture and religion aren't independent things with a motive force. The are codependent and driven by the individual/collective experiences of the people that construct or inhabit them. 

This saying ""Islam"" says or ""their culture says"" , is essentially meaningless. 

Which is why your analysis comes a cropper when you think about it. ",0,1401727378,null,0,false,0,chxa374,t3_271rs7,t1_chxa374,t1_chx5r2z,null,1434061205,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I don't see the ""cost"" you're presenting. We get more people in they pay the pensions of the next generation, then we get more people in to pay for that. Sounds good to me. The more population we have the more we're capable of.

&gt; Also Japan is good case studies as a forerunner, they've hit the densely populated city thing and now their population is declining from underneath them.....  So far it doesn't seem to have negatively effected them.

I'm pretty sure its just about to come bite them. You're right though, we should pay close attention to Japan as they're more experienced here with high ageing populations but they're not typically fans of immigration.

With the remaining 30 mil:

(7 mil) Micah Richards

Yes, I know he is injury prone but his upside is huge.  He is relatively young, physically enormous, good in the air and though he is fast he doesn't rely solely on pace.  I think between him and Flanno they can handle it.  Especially with Henderson playing on the right side of the diamond / 4-3-3 they will get defensive cover.  

23 Mil

Emre Can (12)

Others have covered the player so I'll leave it at that.  But if the wage problems cause the deal to fall through I'll offer another.  
 
Song (12) For about the same price and maybe cheaper they can bring in Song.  I'd prefer youth (Can) to Song but he could bring a lot to LFC.  Song is excellent at dinking balls over the top of defenders (he assisted RVP a bunch of times doing just this) and is experienced in the park for when a real solid DM is needed over Stevie G.  CL proven and would be an excellent addition.  

11 Mil remaining.  

Thorgan Hazard.  

It may be difficult to pry him from Chelsea's grip but although I think this is impossible (I think Shaqiri is a more realistic option and one I hope we get) I'll say him anyway. 

If he has any of the potential of his brother (and he does) I'd love to see a player like that in a LFC shirt.  I believe he was the highest goalscorer in Belgium and could provide some creativity to unlock defenses.

true,baccalad,null,null,"Well I passed my test early 2012 but I've only been driving since April 2013. I live in the north east of England and I have been pulled over literally a ridiculous amount of times in my year and a bit of driving. I have lost count of how many times I've been pulled over but it must be 30+, I'll try and recount as many as I can remember. Being pulled over (generally speaking) doesn't bother me, especially at the times when I know I haven't or am not doing anything wrong (which isn't always as you'll see). I'd also like to say beforehand that I have been as polite as ever in all my dealings with the police whenever I've been pulled over.

-My first car was a Y reg 2001 Ford Fiesta Zetec, I remember the very first time I was ever pulled over, I was coming up to a bend in the road coming out of the town centre late at night and I took it too quickly, there was a police Vauxhall Astra waiting at a junction on the bend, he followed me pulled me over for my manner of driving and I was breathalysed and blew 0.
I'm trying to think of any other times I was pulled over before I got my next car (there will be others) but I can't remember any.

-My next car was an 02 reg Peugeot 206, one time I was pulled over by a Vauxhall Astra for driving through an industrial estate at around 2 in the morning with 3 of us in the car. I can obviously see how this arouses suspicion but we genuinely weren't doing anything wrong. There were 2 police in the car, one man and one woman and it quickly became clear that they were corrupt. We were all searched and the man was looking under all the seats and lifting everything out of the boot trying (and obviously convinced that we were up to no good) to find something wrong with us. Upon finding nothing he asked me what I was going to do now and I said I'm probably just going to go on a little drive and he told me no you're not you're going to go straight home because you're insurance is invalid, at which point I thought well no it can't be because you wouldn't let me drive home if my insurance was invalid, you would take the car off me, but I agreed with him anyway. Afterwards I checked all my details on my insurer's website anyway just to be sure and all was in check.

Another time I was pulled over in the 206 I was driving on a country road and a police riot van no less pulled out of a junction and followed me for about 5-10 minutes before pulling me over for having a headlight out. He seemed nice enough and told me that it'd been a massive struggle trying to keep up with me in the riot van and that it was overheating, he told me to get the light fixed and let me go on my way.

After a couple of months with the 206 (it's kind of a long story) but the car was written off in a crash that wasn't my fault and because I still had the fiesta I went back to driving that.

-In my second stretch of driving the fiesta (these probably aren't going to be in order because they are all jumbled up in my memory):

One time I was was being followed by a black undercover Skoda Octavia , I think he was going to leave us alone until he thought he saw one of the passengers in the back throw something (weed) out of the window, he stopped us intending to search us and the car but said he couldn't smell any cannabis so he wouldn't bother, he checked my tyres and told me one of them was on the limit.

I was driving home on the road right near my house late at night doing about 35 in a 30 and I went past a traffic BMW 3 series estate going in the other direction, he span around and booted it to catch up to me and followed me home. He asked me what was with the speed to which  replied I was only doing about 30/35, he never replied actually replied but I'm guessing he just thought fair enough. He then told me that I headlight out and told me to get it sorted. He seemed nice enough and he told me to ""lay off with the heavy right foot"" before he left.

Once I was driving along late at night in Redcar doing 50 in a 40 and I didn't notice a police traffic BMW estate behind me, he followed me for a bit and pulled me over, I really liked this police man he seemed friendly and had a bit of a laugh with me, he got me in the back of his car and said you were going a tad bit fast there and he asked me what I was doing with all those girls in my car, he ran all of our details through the system before letting me go.

Another time, on the same road in Redcar on a different night I was driving along doing the speed limit and I was again pulled over by a traffic BMW estate, he just wanted to know what we were up to ""this late at night"". I had a full car and he asked me what was in my boot, I said I don't know just the spare tyre I think and I took the key out the ignition and said take a look. He jokingly said oh so I have to look myself do I, he had a quick look before coming back round to the driver's door and saying I just wanted to check you didn't have a sixth person hiding in the boot before letting me go on my way.

Another time in Redcar at night going along a different road I was doing 40 in a 30 and I went past a BMW X5 going in the different direction. They span around and pulled me over before commenting on my speed. I apologised and they got me in the back of their car. They were friendly enough and weren't too bothered about the speeding and just wanted to give me a VDRN for having a headlight out before letting me go.

Another time I was followed for about 5-10 miles by a BMW X5 along a 50mph limit duel carriageway, he followed me for about half a mile after the duel carriageway ended onto normal roads before pulling me over, he didn't say much he just asked if I had any identification (I only had my passport), he took it back to his car for about 5 minutes before coming back giving me my passport back and letting my go on my way.

In the US she would end up paying thousands of dollars in health insurance, deductibles, excesses etc whereas here she can get it all free at the point of care.

OP has also shown (admittedly just from her comments here) that she does intend to repay the taxpayer that treats her by working here and paying taxes, and even if she only stays for a year I would personally consider that a good tradeoff - a human life for a year of minimum wage taxes. I'm not in any way saying that a human life is worth so little, of course not. It's beyond comparison, but the repayment to our society of even a little bit of what has been spent on treating OP would be a great gesture.

And besides, once OP is being treated, what's to say she would be limited to a minimum wage job?

Well, I thought because of your worry that we're paying a lot you may be interested in the accounting aspect of the club rather than the players we're getting.

&gt; My point that you seemed to have missed is that if we buy a RB then we have 3 players in Enrique, Johnson and Flanagan to compete for the LB position. Whereas with another LB we'd only have Johnson and Flanagan to play at RB.

Johnson never was, and never will be an out and out LB. If we have a specialist LB then we have 2 for each position.

I presume you know what I meant? Without direct action against an individual EEA citizens can move here freely with an accepted form of ID.

&gt; That's a comment I don't actually understand.

We have immigration targets (which I strongly agree with). Ie our government says we do not want a net migration into the country of more than X in a given year. Since there are negligible restrictions on EU citizens this then means to meet those targets we have to severely restrict immigration from elsewhere. This means even if every EU immigrant comes here to work and contributes to the economy, potentially more beneficial workers from elsewhere who could be contributing more have to be turned away. As per my previous argument every non-contributing (no matter how much a minority) EEA immigrant is a chance removed for someone else.

&gt; Not to mention that there's an assumption problem

What is indisputable is that no matter how much a minority, there are people immigrating here and committing crimes (look up the crime stats). You are right in that I am assuming many of them came here with that aim, but it doesn't matter. If they came here and were forced into it through lack of finding employment its the same issue - standard visa restrictions would make this much less likely to happen (background checks, skills vs skill shortages etc.)

&gt; Also ,compared to our population of local welfare claimants and criminals, is the population of these assumed benefits claimants or criminals that much of a statistical issue?

Its very hard to find the current countrywide figures (and I have better things to do than trawl through endless government spreadsheets), however immigrants in 2011 were responsible for 14 percent of crime (~11% of population). In the year for my home county and current residence (Kent, Scotland) 33% of murders (and I tent to think both will have lower than average immigrant levels). A third of all rapes nationwide were committed by immigrants.. This all sounds statistically relevant to me.

But as mentioned before, my biggest issue is that with basic checks most of this could be irradiated. Checks we can no longer do.",0,1401728374,null,0,false,0,chxak6t,t3_271rs7,t1_chxak6t,t1_chx9f7c,null,1434061426,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

But the structure of the argument you were presenting is the one that is presented when discussing ""mass immigration"". This is why the label was used. 

One of the core problems with this debate is that the use of these short cuts, and the conflation, all lead to misleading conceptions about what is happening and what has happened. It creates the space for the kind of fractious and angry debate that occurs because there's much *sturm und drang* about things that aren't fully understood  or aren't, quite deliberately, explained.

Bars are always a tricky one for me. I've been a barman for over ten years now and I am incredibly picky about where I go due to my own, over inflated standards. I'd already been warned about Kasbah, and it already didn't strike me as the kind of place I'd like to go myself, never mind with my girl. I believe it'll be a case of trial and error as far as finding somewhere I like and feel comfortable, especially being new to the place. 

It's become increasingly apparent that there's very little to do in Coventry, very much like Durham (my home city) it's pubs you don't want to be in, a cathedral and various other historical buildings and a cinema, and that's your lot.

Hmm, the Maastricht Treaty allows us to have border control with Passport ID only as part fo the opt-outs and agreements accepted by Major. We're not part of Shengen, you can't just use any ID. 


&gt;As per my previous argument every non-contributing (no matter how much a minority) EEA immigrant is a chance removed for someone else.

That isn't really an argument though. Considering that the non-Eu citizen would have no entitlement to benefits regardless of status, unless on asylum , which we aren't counting and are restricted. 

Secondly, places and jobs aren't finite. There's no hard limit on the scarcity of both. The idea that one immigrant replaces another is a complete fallacy and misreading of how societies create jobs and people contribute to a society. It's not a linear relationship.

true,baccalad,null,null,"Once I was driving along late at night in Redcar doing 50 in a 40 and I didn't notice a traffic police BMW 3 series estate behind me, he followed me for a bit and pulled me over, I liked this policeman he seemed friendly and had a bit of a laugh with me, he got me in the back of his car and said you were going a bit fast there and he asked me what I was doing with all those girls in my car, he ran all of our details through the system before letting me go. Later on on the same night I was driving along a road and I noticed a vauxhall astra police car parked up in a car park (I guess you could say hiding and waiting), he pulled out and followed me and then pulled me over and commented saying you were going a tad fast, he checked everything was in order and let me go. Yet again, later on on the very same night I was I was followed by a Vauxhall Vivaro police van and he pulled me over for a routine check, I told him that this was the third time tonight I’d been pulled over and he said “oh this is the third time I’ll just let you get on your way” and he left straight away. So yeah I was once pulled over 3 times in one night.

Another time, on a road in Redcar on a different night I was driving along and I was pulled over by a traffic BMW estate, he just wanted to know what we were up to ""this late at night"". I had a full car and he asked me what was in my boot, I said “I don't know just the spare tyre I think” and I took the key out the ignition and said take a look. He jokingly said “oh so I have to look myself do I?”, he had a quick look before coming back round to the driver's door and saying “I just wanted to check you didn't have a sixth person hiding in the boot” before letting me go on my way.

Another time in Redcar late at night going along a different road I was doing 40 in a 30 (I thought it was a 40 road) and I went past a BMW X5 going in the different direction. They span around and pulled me over before commenting on my speed. I apologised and they got me in the back of their car. They were friendly enough and weren't too bothered about the speed and gave me a VDRN for having a headlight out before letting me go. Before I left I asked them how could they even tell I was speeding and they said it’s our job and once you’ve been doing it long enough you can tell.

Another time I was followed for about 5-10 miles by a BMW X5 along a 50mph limit dual carriageway, he followed me for about half a mile after the dual carriageway ended onto “normal” roads before pulling me over, he didn't say much he just asked if I had any identification (I only had my passport), he took it back to his car for about 5 minutes before coming back giving me my passport back and letting my go on my way.

Another time I was seen quite late at night driving on a road quite close to where I live by a BMW X5 which decided to follow me. The man who pulled me over seemed a lot lot more stern and serious than any of the other police I've had dealings with, he got me in the back of his car to have a quick chat with me before asking me about the condition of my car. I said it's ok, it’s what you'd expect for a Y reg. He then got out of the X5 before checking all around my car, including the tyres, checking every little detail, commenting on a missing side indicator the patches of rust on the rear arches saying that it's 3 points and that I needed to get it sorted. He said that if I were to hit a pedestrian where the patches of rust where on the rear arches that it was very dangerous (I just went along with him even though I thought it would be near enough impossible to hit a pedestrian where the rear arches of the car are). I suppose I should be thankful he was nice enough to let me go without doing me I guess?

On another occasion I was followed by a Vauxhall Vivaro van coming out of the town centre late one night and pulled over. The two policemen in the van commented on how I seemed to be excessively braking when people were crossing the road in front of me, to which I replied “I don’t really want to take any risks with drunk people crossing the road in front of me because they are unpredictable so I’d rather brake and keep a clear distance from them”. They took me into the back of the van and breathalysed me anyway because they said that the way I was driving and braking was a trait of drink driving. I blew 0.

The only time I’ve ever been pulled over and done is when I was sped past a petrol station at about 50 in a 40 zone, at about 2 in the morning, overtaking a car just past the petrol station. There was a police BMW X5 waiting just next to the car wash at the petrol station, hidden in a spot where you couldn’t see them. They followed me and pulled me over and they policeman asked me if I knew why I’d been pulled over and he said don’t treat me like an idiot so I admitted what I’d done. They got me into the back of the car and I asked if I was going to get points for what I’d done, he said it depends on your tyre tread (his colleague was checking my tyres at that point), and I got 3 points and breathalysed for the tyre tread being too low (0.6mm I think it was), but they weren’t even going to do me for speeding and overtaking a car which was nice enough of them I guess.

-My third and current car is a 61 reg Vauxhall Astra which I got 3 and a half months ago. When I got the car I thought I would get pulled over a lot lot less than I did with the older cars with it being sort of a nearly new car but I have still been pulled over a fair few times.

Once I was followed by along the A19 south onto the A66 by a BMW estate car which then pulled me over in a lay-by on the A66. He said he pulled me over because of my manner of driving. I’m honestly not too sure what he meant because I thought I was driving perfectly normal (I was aware that there was a police car behind me the whole time). He never told me off or anything like that he just said “your manner of driving” and never commented on it anymore than that. He checked all my details before letting me go on my way.

Another time I was followed along the A19 south by a marked Ford S-Max. He pulled me over into a lay-by and he said he pulled me over because I was going so slow (I’d been doing 50/55 and had been even before I noticed the police car behind me). I just said it was just because I was in no rush which was true and he told me to wait in my car while he ran my details through back in his car. He said when I’ve run your details through and it comes back all clear I’ll flash you so that you can pull out of the lay-by and I’ll pull out behind you. When he flashed me I pulled out and once I’d reached about 70 he flew (and I mean flew) past me in the outside lane, giving me a friendly wave as he went past. I think he was showing off haha.

Another time I was pulled in the Astra I was followed by a Vauxhall Vivaro van into a petrol station which then pulled in front of me to block me in (as if I was going to try and escape). The man then came out and checked everything was in order before letting me go on my way. (This one really confused me, especially the way in which they blocked me in?)

And then literally just yesterday I was pulled over twice in one night. The first time I pulled out of a car park onto a road and literally drove for about 2 seconds before realising that my lights weren’t on I turned them on straight away and then noticed when I looked in my mirror that there was a police BMW X5 behind me and I knew I was getting pulled over straight away haha. He said we pulled you over because you didn’t have your lights on when you pulled out of the car park and he asked why I didn’t have them on and I just said I didn’t realise at first and then he asked if I’d had a drink tonight to which I replied no, he then asked me again if I’d had a drink to which I replied no, then he asked me if I drink in general. He then told me to come over to their car for a breathalyser test. He said I except you’ll blow 0 anyway because I can’t smell any alcohol anyway. I blew 0.

Then later on last night I was parked up on a road with my hazard lights on (it was about 2 in the morning and the road was pretty much dead) and an undercover Ford Focus pulled up next to me and one of the police inside said what are you doing parked up in the middle of the road (at which point I felt a bit stupid) and he told me to move on. I pulled off and carried on driving along the road at which point they followed me and pulled me over because one of my passengers in the back was acting stupid. They both got out and joked about it being past his bed time and then he told me again about being parked in the middle of the road he said “if I wanted to (which I don’t want to by the way) because you’ve got a good attitude I could fine you for being parked in the middle of the road.

So yeah I have been pulled over a lot of times and I can see sometimes I’ve brought it upon myself i.e. by driving late at night or slightly breaking the speed limit, but other times I seem to get pulled over for no reason.",0,1401729285,null,0,false,0,chxaznm,t3_1wkp9w,t1_chxaznm,t1_chxaf42,null,1434061694,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

When you get lots of powerful people in a room, you may get lots of discussion, lots of talking, but nothing will be decided. Look at every single international conference, institution, body, organisation, event, summit, whatever. The UN, the UNSC, G8, G20, the EU etc. You don't get consensus, you don't get quick decisions, you don't get agreement. Criticisms of these bodies back to the League of Nations is that they are slow, weak, fractured and only really effective on matters that are so shallow and vague, there can't be disagreement, or of such minor importance that the powerful players don't care. To get agreement on anything serious or substantial takes months of not years of careful negotiations, compromises, legal write ups, reviews, re-reviews, more negotiations. This isn't just because what they do gets reported in the press, this is because powerful people like most people often fundamentally disagree with each other, and are interested in different things. 

 So why bilderberg would be any different involves this ludicrous conspiracy nutter level assumption that all powerful people across the political spectrum and from all sorts of backgrounds with all sorts of vested interests, once a degree of opacity has been established, would suddenly become like-minded, agreeable, executively practical, with identical morals and goals.

The notion that anything of any importance at all being decided at bilderberg involves making the assumption that all those factors which inspire disagreement amongst people on such a fundamental level somehow dissipate once the cameras aren't there.

true,has-13,eng-westmidlands,Burminum,"I totally agree, and that's where I think this country has got it wrong. I went to normal 'secular' state schools. But In primary school every morning we would sing religious songs/hymns, for instance Amazing Grace. I appreciate it's a Christian country, but that school was made up of ~95% children who were non-Christian, and yet we were forced by our deputy headteacher to sing 4 mornings a week. No one raises an eyebrow there, and fair enough it's Christianity. I'd be fine with this in a Christian-majority school, but forcing non-Christian/mostly Muslim kids to sing hymns is just not on imo, and some would argue is against Islam. I'm sure this is a fairly common practice. These schools havent been found to do anything like this, so I think there is something of a double standard to be seen.

And we have to bear in mind a lot of this hysteria is arising from allegations made by parents. Schools and religion are a political minefield, and it's not beyond comprehension that some parents are always unhappy. The anonymity of the whistleblower doesn't help the credibility of the accusations either in my view. 

Honestly, I can see why this is being dubbed a witch-hunt. Ultimately I think schools should be truly secular with no religious input whatsoever. This whole investigation seems to me to be down in a large part to Ofsted being under threat, and Gove putting pressure where he thinks it can win over public opinion. 

I live in Birmingham, and I know what schools here are like. When &gt;95% of a population is of a certain group, it seems stupid to not cater to them if it's done for similar groups in other schools. What's wrong with a call to prayer if it's wanted? What's wrong with a prayer room if it's wanted as well? Just because it doesn't sit right with people who are blind to the reality in these areas because theyve never seen a muslim in their life makes it worse that the government and media should add more fuel to the fire imo.

BUT, last year I figured up a way to make my trip happen though. My husband was born in Germany &amp; lived there until he reached 17 years old when he had to move to the US with his career Military father &amp; German mother, he's traveled a lot &amp; lived in the US pretty much since. He does still have a brother &amp; several aunts &amp; uncles in Germany &amp; we alternate who visits whom, about every 5 years his family, mom, dad, other brother, &amp; myself go to Germany and about every 3 years his eldest brother in Germany visits the states with his family. In 2009 unfortunately I missed THAT visit, my son was 4 at the time &amp; had the flu, as I did, so I encouraged my husband to take his best friend rather than lose the money towards my ticket at least. He did &amp; had a blast. Fortunately for me this built me up quite a bit of goodwill credits with the hubby so this year not only will we visit Germany during the holiday (yay!) he's made arrangements for us to head to London (shopping!!) &amp; Cardiff to hit the Doctor Who Experience. The only drawback was I had to forfeit Paris but we've been there 3 times so I'm okay with that! Because it's DOCTOR WHO!!!!

My son, a HUGE Doctor Who fan, has no idea about this, it's an extra holiday surprise for him:) not only will he get 6 more days added to his Christmas holiday at the start (because of how the holiday falls he'll only miss 3 extra days, thank you weekends!) than the other kids AND he gets to go back 4 days later too. And during this almost 3 weeks of awesomeness? He gets surprised with going to the Doctor Who experience!

At an 18% return?

&gt; Pay off debts with savings. As Johnny has no savings, he has to borrow the £5,000 on his credit cards. This leaves him with no savings and £5,000 debt on his credit card at 18%.
In other words, Johnny is in exactly the same position in situation B, regardless of what he does. Yet before the emergency he was £800 a year better off by paying off his debts with his savings.”

So your point is that at the very worst Johnny is in an identical situation? Every month before the emergency saves him money, which you've not factored in at all. In reality, in situation B he'd have £5k on his credit card **but not have paid £900 in interest on it**

&gt; I don’t think a person with a mission to get rid of debt would actually re-borrow at higher rates.

So you're suggesting they hold on to an 18% debt just in case they'd have to borrow at a higher rate in the future?

I've no doubt Poch will want to find a way to integrate Paulinho, who does himself have some valuable traits per Poch's system such as his ability to find space in the box, but I think Holtby with some stamina could provide the intense press with intent toward fast and incisive creativity that Poch would love to have from midfield to get the ball higher more quickly. Poch also very much favors the vertical ball, something Holtby provides far more of than Paulinho. 

We should see plenty of experimentation this fall, and given the talent of our disposal in midfield it should be enjoyable to watch as long as everyone is patient and looks for the signs of improvement and promise rather than the immediate result.

The not so funny thing is that this tolerance actual discriminates and  actually itself creates racism towards those from the muslim cultures who want to move ahead and adopt a more liberal outlook to life by employing the term ""islamophobia"".

true,D-Hex,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;The 2011 figures are valid. I looked through two current spreadsheets to find no breakdown for the necessary figures. You've not looked them up to provide a counter argument either!

You employed the figures then said you couldn't be arsed. Where's the source? 

&gt;You seem to be picking at irrelevant details rather than actually making any counter argument.

We're not part of Shengen thus we still have border controls. It's something I want to remove from our misconceptions of immigration. We control our border, what we don't do is stop people from the EU unless we have good cause such as criminality - and we don't restrict their right to work, residence and any accrued rights from various treaties. 

&gt;What are you on about? 

Very simply. Jobs aren't finite. Density is finite but is so far away from our sustainable levels that , at the moment, it's not within the levels that it matters substantively. 

Jobs aren't finite for three reasons. First - jobs are  function of the prevailing circumstance so they depend on macro factors like growth and micro ones like the actions of firm at the micro level. Second, Jobs aren't dependent on natural scarcity - they aren't coal or gold so they can permanently vanish. Third, jobs can be created out of nowhere and new jobs can't be predicted - no one knew they needed SEO consultants 30 years ago for example. 

With immigrant numbers as well, the type of immigrant and the individual nature of the immigrant is so varied that you cannot mark out defined slots. An immigrant Doctor for example could be a net job creator simply be doing that job - because they end up buying a house, a car, food and the ancillary effects create activity in the economy which could lead to jobs. An immigrant Management Consultant could also be responsible for the downsizing and restructuring of a local firm.

Now both those examples are HS immigrants but the social worth and the value added is different. The same could be said for a Polish guy who comes over and creates a Contracting firm rtc. 

So the suppositions you being with are flawed. Arguing that all these numbers are swappable and finite needs some real focus on your part. 

&gt;Our current services are designed only to handle so many people. You cannot build housing &amp; schools or provide additional emergency services overnight.

Our public services are designed to operate at certain capacity but immigration isn't the main driving factor. It's our local population that drives prediction models and resource allocation. By far the most important numbers that matter to future planning are things like the demographic of the ageing populations and future tax revenues.  The most excessive impact on that is the 85% of British people not the 15% of immigrants. 

We have more issues dealing with long term social care for the elderly, who are British, than we do with immigrants who tend to be younger and healthier. The unit care cost for social per person is GBP623

[Here' a nice breakdown of the figures used for immigrants ](http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2013/09/hard-evidence-are-migrants-draining-welfare-system)


&gt;There is huge opposition to further development and immigration adding constraints to what the government can and can't do

Well, yes there is, which is political and social question, not one about demand and the implications on a fiscal level. However, if the debate is conducted with misconceptions ruling over actual analysis this is to be expected. 

&gt; I enjoy living in the countryside. I do not want the south east to become one huge mega-city.

Which isn't the fault of immigrants, it's the fault of bad planning policy and the way our country is structured economically. The south east will become crowded simply because the centre of economic gravity is London and unless steps are taken to change that it will continue.

&gt;So, the government has a target - if 6 months into the year 80% of that quota is taken pressure starts to mount. 

Which again isn't an argument because the quota was political grandstanding and bore no relation to economic policy or any hard headed study of immigration effects.

- Make sure if you use a website for research, you note down the link somewhere as a bibliography. Avoid websites that have links to the coursework - don't take the risk. 
- Make sure you use your time efficiently. Assuming you have the task papers, highlight exactly what you have to do, and make notes of key information or steps that you could do.  You can try and put an estimate on how long it will take you to do it, if that will help you keep track. 
- Don't waste time making your work visibly appealing- as long as it is clear and methodical, your not going to get marked for layout!
- Make sure that you complete *all* of the tasks. If you miss one out, they seriously dock your marks so make an attempt at everything

Decision requires consensus, I doubt the meeting is one person telling everyone else there what to do. So if they ""decide"" the course of nations, that must mean there is consensus there. So you did introduce it.

financial bailouts,
primacy of the banking sector,
motoring extremism,
rationale for war,
austerity,
capitalism,
intellectual property,
total internet surveillance,

Ah I see, you are angry because you think many of them don't hold your views. Well firstly you don't know there is agreement amongst them; secondly, there is a lot of room for disagreement within those topics; and thirdly, what the fuck is motoring extremism? 

&gt; You've already claimed that secrecy makes a difference—things can be said that couldn't be said in public—now you are saying it doesn't make a difference.

I said secrecy makes a difference to the discussion, ie things can be said. It doesn't make a difference to people agreeing or disagreeing over those things that are said, nor does it make a difference to things being decided. 'Said' is not the same as 'agree' or 'decided'. http://www.oed.com/

&gt; It makes no sense that the group expends great energies up to creating an effective military greenzone unless something significant is happening.

The entire point is that they can talk freely. They can't do that with tinfoilers with video cameras hiding in the bushes. Hence the heavy security. There is also the added reason that it is a concentration of a lot of powerful people which is a security risk from terrorists/assassination attempts. If you let off a bomb there and wiped out the guests, shit would go down. Hence the heavy security. And thirdly, there has to be an added amount of visible security to psychologically reassure the guests of both those points, otherwise they wouldn't turn up. Hence the heavy security.

true,mofman,,Armagh,"&gt; It hasn't really, you might want to have a gander at /r/badhistory sometime.

I have no idea how you can say it hasnt when millions have died at the hands of religion. Slavery, burning of 'witches' and homosexuals which still happens today. Even the simple idea that the earth was flat and NOT the center of the universe; the church would kill or imprison anyone who said otherwise. Today we struggle with getting people to 'believe' that evolution is where we came from because their religious book says otherwise. Embyonic stem cell theapy; one of the most promising areas of modern biology is being constantly pushed down because of religion. Even simpiler the case of the Indian woman who died in Ireland recently because she couldnt recieve a life saving abortion. Anyway you can read more well written arguments here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_religion


&gt;As for the verses you've mentioned, consider that if a work contains a concept or action, it's not endorsing it. By that logic Titus Andronicus advocates rape.

Umm you do realise that Titus Andronicus is a work of fiction right and the Bible is touting itself as the word of God? These verses are commandments of God himself, so when God says kill all the men, women, children and babies it brings into question his character, especially when we're also commanded not to kill... doesnt that strike you as a tad schizophrenic? Or to rephase that, do you think its ever okay to kill a child?

Squad #3: Shaw or Kalas for me. Kalas used this number when he was out on loan (can't remember what team but I think it was one in Bundesliga?) and Shaw because of the whole Twitter thing. 

Squad #4: Pains me to say it, but I can see Fabregas taking it IF he makes the move. It makes sense. He's always used it and it's vacant. Maybe Varane? 

Squad #5: Azpilicueta uses 5 for Spain if I'm not mistaken, so unless he plans on making 28 his own, it would make sense for him to take it. 

Squad #6: Koke would be a major shout should we get him. Pogba being another possibility even though the transfer is highly unlikely. If neither acquisition happens, I can see Matić trading up 21 for a more conventional midfield number. 

Squad #8: I have absolutely no idea. Maybe Barkley? I'd honestly very much appreciate it if the club vacated the number for one season but if they didn't do it for Drogba (Oscar) then I doubt they'll do it for Frank.

true,nivlark,,County,"I'd think pretty carefully before choosing catered to be honest. A lot of the international (read: oriental) students pick it, so if you're from the UK or another EU country you may find yourself lonely.

Also, the way catering works is that you get a meal card that you can use in the food outlets around campus, with money put on it as part of your rent. Anyone can buy exactly the same card, its not exclusive to catered students. So going for catered accommodation just means giving up having a proper kitchen, you're not going to get meals delivered to your flat or anything fancy like that.

In terms of which college to pick, it has no impact on your course whatsoever. Basically, it's a question of where on campus you'd like to live, and in what kind of accommodation. Even where you'd like to live is not that important, campus is not that huge. If we've got any geographers here perhaps they could confirm, but I think geography lectures are mostly in the LEC theatre, which is pretty much smack bang in the middle of campus. I live at the extreme north end of campus and can make it down there inside of ten minutes.

So onto types of accomodation. The whole standard/superior thing is hopelessly confusing so the best bet is probably [this facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/LancasterSBS/photos_albums) which has pictures of the different kinds of room each college has.

Other than that, I really recommend getting along to campus for a tour if you've not been on one already - [here's the dates](http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/study/visit-days-and-campus-tours/campus-tours-and-booking-form/). You'll get to see some accommodation on those - I'm a tour guide and try to fit in three or four viewings if I've got the time. If you can't make those dates you can come and have a look around anyway. Either way, if you do head up (or down, depending on your level of Scottishness!) drop me a PM and I'd be happy to show you round my place -  I've been in a County townhouse this year which I absolutely love. Unless it's before a week on Tuesday in which case I will be tearing my hair out with exams ;)

Sorry this is pretty long, but hopefully it's vaguely helpful. And if you do have any other questions feel free to ask them here, or PM me.

In those most contrived, worse-case scenarios you'll be in in an equally bad situation with both setups (i.e. emergency happens same day as debt repayment). In that case it's taking money from the right hand and giving it to the left.

Let's look at some plausible examples with a well-behaved debtor:

Scenario 1: I pay off the debt immediately, I save 600 a month in the meantime. After 11 months the roof fails. My savings are worth about ~£6,665.76 assuming ~2% interest.

After the £5K expense, I have ~£1665.

Scenario 2: I pay back a substantial amount at £500 a month @ 18%APR, and save £100 p/m at ~2%. Due to the compounding effect I've repaid £5421. Savings are worth ~£5210 after interest.

&gt; One of the core problems with this debate is that the use of these short cuts, and the conflation, all lead to misleading conceptions about what is happening and what has happened. It creates the space for the kind of fractious and angry debate that occurs because there's much sturm und drang about things that aren't fully understood or aren't, quite deliberately, explained.

If you want to stick to academic discussion I suggest you do that. Popular politics is not based on complex understanding of issues, but a simplified understanding. It has to be by its very nature.

* A broken down coach can be overtaken (try doing that on a train).
* Far more flexible.  You can run more services at peak times and run extra for special occasions.  A lot of trains are run under-capacity because they have a fixed size.

If you look at the exciting developments in Light Aircraft, none of it is really coming from the UK.

Myself I think this is a mistake, as some of the pressure for making more and more fuel efficient designs comes from this sector.  Big airlines aren't going to risk on anything radical, they want refinement of existing designs the 777/787 being great examples of this attitude.

However GA has embraced diesel engines to some degree, the new rotex engines are popular as they allow for massive fuel savings.

The Lycoming engines common in the Cessna / Pipers, that use 1930s technology in 1960s designs often burn 8 US gal per hour at least.  This often means just £60 per hour in fuel, often as much as £100, before you worry about other things.  This makes the hobby types lean heavily towards the newer cheaper engines.

Sadly the UK has really made it hard for people to learn to fly without massive investment, its around double the price in the US.  So if you are wanting to make innovative aircraft on the lower budget end, the UK simply isn't a place to do it.

I've got on my bucket list building an kit airplane.  If it was today, it would be a glassair.  It's sad when you think how little there is in the UK to compete.",0,1401740848,null,0,false,0,chxglsv,t3_271y40,t1_chxglsv,t1_chx6g0p,null,1434064342,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

There isn't any magical force exerted by the Premier League which has rendered him powerless - he's a Champions League quality striker hampered by our playing style and a resulting lack of confidence in front of goal.

Second, selling Soldado would be a sign of ridiculous short-termism and that's a major fear of mine as regards this club.  If Atletico will pay big money for him (for whatever reason) then it might be decent business, because it could be put towards a younger player.  But I'm concerned that we're leaning towards cutting our losses on most of last summer's purchases and I think that's panic triumphing over common sense.

Draxler plays in a completely different style. He uses his pace to get beyond defenders, something that Gotze didn't as he likes to play in between the lines. He opitimises why having a player cutting in from a wide position is so dangerous as he is able to create oppurtunities for himself and his teammates. 

While certain aspects of his game might remind you of Gotze's style, like his ability to lay on oppurtunities for team mates while cutting in, he is not the same. He is the modern winger, the same as Robben is on the opposite side.

&gt;Wenger has a history of *trying* to make wide men stikers

So the trying bit matters, cos it doesn't always work, as opitimised by Podolski himself. But he did do it with RVP. He was a LW in Holland, came to Arsenal and Wenger made him a Striker.

true,joeinthebox,lfcwfmm,,"Haha. I find it hard to believe that sentiment had *nothing* to do with the move but in all seriousness, I think Lambert makes a good point: He made it back to Liverpool FC based on his own merits.

I think Andy Hunter in this Guardian column makes several solid points:

1.

&gt;Liverpool had the Premier League’s finest two forwards in Sturridge and Luis Suárez last season. Beyond that, however, there was only Iago Aspas ... Rodgers had few match-changing options available on the rare occasions Suárez’s or Sturridge’s contribution dipped during the title run-in or when Liverpool ran out of patience in that defining home defeat by Chelsea ... focusing on Aspas’s meagre contribution compared with that of the Chelsea substitute Willian.

2.

&gt;Lambert will require patience in competition with Suárez and Sturridge for a first team place at Anfield. That can test any player accustomed to a regular starting role, even one who has sealed a dream transfer

I think this is one of the first things that popped into my head. Lambert will no longer have the luxury of knowing he'll start pretty much every match which means every start or appearance will be magnified and the pressure to do what he does best will be increased. Hopefully he can handle that pressure.

3.

&gt;Lambert’s signing signals a departure in transfer policy for FSG, who did not back Rodgers to the hilt when he wanted to sign Clint Dempsey, 29 years old at the time, from Fulham in 2012. It underlines what the manager’s new contract has already confirmed. They have no cause to doubt him now.

We may have dodged a bullet with Dempsey but I still wonder how he would have played/developed under Rodgers. In any event, I see a lot of supporters talking about FSG's so-called transfer policy of buying/developing young players to create a profit. I personally do not think that is the case. I think FSG has just been cautious/wary about transfers since the Andy Carroll, Stewart Downing, Charlie Adam moves but maybe now this Lambert transfer does signal a shift away from that caution and perhaps FSG are ready to loosen the purse strings a bit.

You call a spade a spade. If you turn a tap on 9 times and water comes out each time, what do you think will happen the 10th time?

So if Wenger takes yet another athletic Left Winger who has similar attributes to the players he has turned into World Class Strikers before, and doesn't have any other World Class strikers at the club, is it really that far out of your ""beliefs"" that he'd do the same thing again, coupled with the plethora of attacking midfielders he already has.

You also asked about the personalities of the colleges, I'll be honest I don't know much, but here's what I do know.

Fylde are known for sport, so if you are so inclined then head there.

County have a nickname of 'c*nty' so read into that what you will. (All colleges have bad nicknames so don't worry about that too much!)

Furness is the smallest college (still at 1,000 people), but they seem up for a laugh and don't take themselves too seriously.

Lonsdale are known as a party college.

Grizedale have a great cocktail bar! Not sure about the actual college though!

If you are paying rent getting a mortgage annuls the rent you pay.

Think about a mortgage as two things; investing in a house and paying interest.

When rates are low the interest is low and hence a large mortgage invests more into a house. This also means you don't have to pay rent. 

If you are investing in equities you are taking out debt and investing in risky products without annuling rent. When investing in a house you don't have to pay rent.

And in terms of a ""bad idea, but I'm young and have an appetite for risk."" this is never true. You have a high appetite for returns and are willing to take some risks to get them.

Look them up. 

&gt;If you want to stick to academic discussion I suggest you do that. Popular politics is not based on complex understanding of issues, but a simplified understanding. 

I don't think one has to have an academic debate or delve into that level of detail to understand the complexities of the debate. What's missing is the political will or the desire to do this. There is a great tradition of intellectualism and especially working class intellectualism that still exists. I'm sure if people tried they could engage effectively. 

&gt;... I think you are fooling yourself if you think people are angry only because they are misinformed. People are also angry because, as I've detailed above, immigration has negatively impacted their lives.

People are angry because their experience of poverty and service withdrawal under both Labour and Coalition have left them disillusioned. 

The misinformation on immigration provides and narrative that allows them locate something that the political elites have done that explains their plight. 

For example, let's go back to the phrase ""mass immigration"". It's worth pondering why those that use it, refuse to clarify what it actually means and when pressed leave enough ambiguity. UKIP used this tactic as a background to their escalator poster about immigration. This is also why UKIP's campaign dovetailed this with anger at the ""establishment"".

Say mortgage minimum payments are £200 per month. After all other expenses, I have £500 per month left over.

The decision I have is either:

* Pay £200 into the mortgage, guarantee a return (through reduction in interest) of 2.5% and invest £300 in ISA with the hopes that that will earn more than 2.5%  

or

* Pay £500 into the mortgage, guaranteeing only a return of 2.5% on the whole £500.

The only time the first option seems better to me is when the return on the S&amp;S ISA is lower than the interest on the mortgage, and I find out every month what the interest on the mortgage will be for the following month (when the MPC has it's meeting on the Thursday after the first Monday of the month).

The price I pay for the investment in property was fixed when I made the offer on the property. I don't see any reason to build up extra equity in the property. Partly because the only way to realise those gains is to move to somewhere worse or smaller. The ""interest"" on my ISA covers the interest I would save by over paying the mortgage.

Eventually you run out of facts and are left with the cold truth that the only thing on your side is your opinion.

While this is the internet, and everyone is entitled to their own opinion, your attempts to end this discussion at an impartial impasse whereby your opinion someone negates the evidence assembled before you is simply not something I am keen on letting slide. And your attempts to be the bigger person by calling a stop to what was actually a pretty decent discussion about the different roles and skills that players bring to the same positions, and their adaptability in new ones puzzled me. So I called you out. Of course its your opinion, your *personal beliefs* as it were, so I harbor no discontent towards you for them.

true,robdabank,JE,jersey,"Signing a younger player for **a greater cost** than a player that has a proven track record in the premier league on the basis of potential is not automatically ""therefore the smarter buy"".

You throw the word potential around like it's a guarantee a player will blossom into a world class talent.

I'm not saying Chelsea should buy Fabregas, but consider the fact that he played 7 full seasons in the PL, he was Arsenal's captain at age 21, and he played an incredibly versatile role during his tenure with Arsenal.

Again, this isn't a video game. There are so many what if's over the course of five years for any player, not every investment in a rising young star will yield a world class footballer. 

Look at Gael Kakuta for our youth team. This guy was the rising star in the reserves between 2007 and 2009, and now look at him. The flip side to potential is players have the potential to not live up to it.

Sorry, I don't buy the ""he'll be more than worth it if we have him for five plus years"". That doesn't take into account a slew of other factors. Look at guys like Marko Marin and Kevin de Bruyne. Young players full of potential and we've shipped (or will probably ship) them off.

On the other hand there's a player who broke a stack of records at Arsenal, became a young captain, won PFA awards, excelled in the most competitive league in the world, and left because he wanted to ""be with his friends"" at Barcelona (and probably win something more than 1 FA Cup).

On a pragmatic level - I'd pay market price for Fabregas over the prospect of **overpaying** for Koke any day of the week, regardless of their age. You could still get 4 solid years out of Fabregas, just like we did with Ballack - and I'd think you'd be hard pressed to find someone who thought Ballack was a stupid signing.",0,1401744777,null,0,false,0,chxik2q,t3_273nnb,t1_chxik2q,t1_chxgfmi,null,1434065334,7,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,7

I employed figures for 2011 because I found those relatively easily. I'm currently on my mobile so can't just pull them out of the history, but I'm sure you can find them.
I said I couldn't be assed in that those two spreadsheets I was looking at were for last years data. Since they didn't give me what I wanted and i'd comitted as much time as I felt worthy I abandoned. Admittedly I could have made that clearer in my last reply.

&gt; It's something I want to remove from our misconceptions of immigration

Reading through my replies I think its clear I know this. If you were doing it for the sake of anyone else reading or I was less obvious than I thought then fair enough.

&gt; Very simply. Jobs aren't finite.

This isn't where I was arguing. My argument is under are current system you were incorrect with ""The idea that one immigrant replaces another is a complete fallacy"". Political grandstanding or not people expect not to be lied to. When those promises are made there is considerable pressure for them to be kept to. Whether that promised number was too low (as i'm sure you'd argue for) or not is irrelevant - it was promised.

You keep turning and saying other issues are far greater, or turning to job levels - I don't really disagree with either of these points. My argument is its an area that CAN be easily improved. There is no easy fix to an ageing population, or the large numbers of British who seem to view it as their right not to work.

The vast majority of eastern Europeans that are responsible for crimes would not have been permitted entry without EU free movement. Many of those who have skills and have been working would have been.

And yes there are no defined slots for immigrants either, but the average trained doctor or proven businessman is going to be more beneficial than the average person entering with no skills, no work experience and a minor criminal record. There are also fields where there are shortages - British tech firms are turning down work because they cannot get the staff.

I get the feeling you are pigeon-holing me. I don't argue many of the things you say then you go on to expand on those points somewhat neglecting my own. I'm not against immigration, not biased against a particular country (Romania for example have used their education system to pour out talented programmers).

What I want is the best for me, those around me and the environment I live in. A federalised Europe would want the best for the average European citizen while Britain is sitting on a fairly decent head start.",0,1401745066,null,0,false,0,chxip0b,t3_271rs7,t1_chxip0b,t1_chxe5o8,null,1434065397,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I honestly couldn't tell you.  My parents moved here when the Troubles were dying down but it was still turbulent enough -- 1996.  My Da couldn't get work anywhere in the English city my Ma's from, he worked in McDonald's, as a butcher, we even owned a petrol station once (My Mum told me this a few years back, I honestly have no recollection) but nothing paid enough.

My maternal grand-father worked between Belfast and Birmingham, so maybe my Mum thought it would be best to move here?  I honestly couldn't say, but I think it was ignorance on my Mum's part.  She was mid-twenties with four children and expecting a fifth, I don't think she paid much heed to where she was staying nor should she have even anticipated the amount of racism, but hey, such is life.

On account of why we haven't moved out though.  We had two *very, fiercely* loyal neighbours who were my family's support pillar.  Both of those neighbours held my Ma when she was crying, we were always welcome into one another's homes, it was lovely having such caring neighbours.

We moved to an area literally five minutes away (still in the same Loyalist type place though) and one of those neighbours has since passed away, whilst the other moved, too, just down the street from where we currently live.

My Ma is stubborn at the best of times, in her own words: ""We have every right to be here just as much as anybody else does.  We're not fucking leaving.""  She also wrote: ""My crime is my colour"" with her lipstick on the unbroken half of the broken wind-shield when someone kicked it in (yes, I know it's hard to kick one in, but this guy must've had some martial arts training or some shit, I swear).  So you can imagine her attitude to moving.

Although, we *did* tell the Police an area of places we'd like to move to but they never followed up on those requests (even though they suggested it).

But aye, there ya go, hopefully that answers it.

true,kingofeggsandwiches,null,null,"I'd definitely go for somewhere near London, for your budget you won't get anywhere central, you'll struggle to even get near a tube station. But for 850 pcm you'll probably be able to afford somewhere out a bit near an overland though which is probably your best option. I've lived in both Manchester and London (and Birmingham too!) and they've all got their pros and cons, but for me nothing beats London for the atmosphere and lifestyle, Manchester isn't a bad place to live mind you, although if you ask me the place gets over sold a tad. I'll weight up from pros and cons for you to think about. 

Manchester - 

pros:   
Far more accommodation for your money  
More central location at a reasonable price  
Shorter commute if you're working in the city  
If you change your mind and want a car this is very doable 

cons:  
Employment prospect don't compare to the London area  
Lower wage average compared to London (although this is totally mitigated by cost of living)  
One of the more rainy areas of the UK

London

pros:  
You get to live in the most happening place in the UK, everything new happens here first.  
More public transport due to the vast population  
Generally best career prospects in the UK  
More money regardless of what you're doing (although you'll still be poorer)  
People everywhere

cons:  
Longer and nightmarish commute  
Highest cost of living in the UK  
Small accommodation at a high cost   
If you decide you want a car you can't because it's a waste of money  
People everywhere  

On the face of it to be honest it looks like you'd be a mad to live in the London, but really it's one of those things you either love or hate. Manchester's good and all but to me it's still just a regular British city whilst London has that bit extra even though you pay for it in every way imaginable. What clinches it for me is living in London it feels like you have something in common with others insofar as you're all sharing in the madness that is London life regardless of your origins or background, you won't find that vibe so easily in any other UK city. You can come to London from anywhere and immediately you're part of it since so few people are actually ""local"", in other cities it helps far more to be a Mancunian or a Brummie or whatever since such a greater share of people are locals themselves. 

I'm sure lots of people are going to strongly disagree with this, because what London offers is very much intangible and the benefits of other cities can be calculated quite rationally, but this is just my personal opinion. What are you looking for OP? Are you the type of person that just wants a comfortable life? Or will you suffer increased poverty, inconvenience and suffering just to be close to the centre of the action? I think age is definitely a factor too, what do you want out of your life right now? For me nothing beats the London vibe, sitting in cramped pub gardens soon as the suns out with the chatter of dozens of accents and languages around you, but for others it's not a price worth paying.

Essentially interest rates will rise and hence your mortgage will become more expensive in the future (at the end of your fixed term), so you should try and invest as much as possible whilst the interest is cheap.

If you invest a lot into your mortgage now then it will mean you pay less interest when interest rates rise in the future (guaranteed to do so) and hence you pay less money to the bank and get more equity in your house.

What you are doing now is using Peter to pay Paul. Peter is the ISA, Paul is the mortgage lender. You are not actually making any money on your £500 as it is going towards Paul.

true,winchyy,lfc68,,"Yes. We bought Suarez in when Torres was still at LFC. He heard about this, and decided that Suarez had to be his replacement, that LFC couldnt have bought him to play alongside him, in what could have been a fantastic partnership.

But he doesnt wait to talk to LFC management about why Suarez has been brought in, but rather just hands in a transfer request on deadline day. No notion of waiting till the summer to better prepare the club where he made his name, where he was adored by Liverpool fans worldwide. To allow them to find the right buyer at the right price and properly address a replacement. So LFC get 50m for him, which in his eyes was fair, and the 200k per week cheques he's cashing must have made it easier to swallow as well, but he moves from Liverpool who finished 2nd the year before over to the Russian Oil Regiment named Chelsea, despite the rivalry that Rafa, the man who bought him into the club, instilled between Liverpool and the Rent Boys.

The only saving grace for him might have been if LFC did infact want to replace him with Suarez. But there next step is to literally throw money at Newcastle to get Andrew ""Horse"" Carroll to try and play the two together. 

Naturally this doesnt work:

1. Because their styles are pretty incompatible
2. Because Carroll was shit
3. Because Carroll was really, really shit

So in reality the only thing we got out of his sale was 15m and an angry, untrained and unkept horse.

He's a cunt because he just jumped ship right on deadline day. He hears about Suarez, calls his agent and says ""He must be here to replace me"". No contact with the club, no contact with Suarez, just Torres being paranoid. His agents lack of activity doesnt help either, and then he just hands in a request, LFC accept the biggest offer they can and he goes to their rivals.

Then he has the audacity to go their in his press conference after his transfer and talk down to the Liverpool fans and the club, saying he needed a bigger challenge, bigger club etc and that the fans needed to get over it.

&gt;  It seems like as soon as a claim is made its chalked up straight into 'that definitely happened' column.

Except that a crap ton of people don't believe it, like folk who make comments like you have here. And they do it *everywhere and all the time* when stuff like this appears. Check out any thread regarding Yewtree etc. on reddit, for starters. A 20-something year old female colleague of mine the other night, speaking about Rolf Harris, said: ""It seems like they're going for anyone at the moment."" Indeed the CPS jumps on just about anyone... who is accused of abuse by multiple people over the course of multiple decades in multiple locations around the world.

I remember when the first allegations came out: ""He can't fight back or defend himself! It can't be proved. They're just after his money!"" It would seem that on the balance of probability, even ignoring the scores of people who have said ""Yeah we knew he was up to something like that/we saw him do that"", he abused people/children. But some of them are genuine! How can we divide them from the probable gold diggers... Or we could consider whether there may be harm caused to those who *were* molested if we associate them in general with those who probably weren't. 

Have you ever talked to someone who has been raped or molested? If you have do you think that we'd be doing them any favours by tarring them with the ""gold digger"" brush? Did you believe them or think that they might be playing the long game, that they might be concocting a story or something like money, fame or notoriety as a pay-off for being ""abused""? Did you, or should you, suggest it to the person? Have you seen any of the numerous interviews with alleged victims of Savile, making it clear that they don't want any money but rather they just want people to know what he did? Do you think they're lying about both the abuse and the not wanting money?

It might sound like I'm being passive aggressive - after all you're only musing on the topic on the internet - but vocalizing that thought in any way does absolutely nothing to help the victims of sexual abuse. Enough of them don't even come forward in the first place!

Personally I have to wonder where the line between empathy and cynicism/'scepticism' lies. It's like people being worried about false rape accusations.

It doesn't take a giant leap to extrapolate to the accusations against Saville to see that a significant number probably also wouldn't have stood up in court had they ever seen the inside of one.

I think this attitude has come about as a response to the perceived over zealousness of the media at reporting accusations when the scandal first broke. Coupled with some high profile acquittals mean that people are now sceptical of any new allegations. I think a lot of people also question the CPS's strategy of bundling a series of weakly evidenced accusations into a group of charges to try and improve their case. Many of which would not have been prosecuted based on their individual merits.

Again I am not saying there are not many genuine victims out there and I hope they all see the justice they deserve. However I think the founding principles of our legal system of innocent until proven guilty and that it is better a guilty person goes free than an innocent one is punished morally oblige us to look one all cases with a critical eye no matter how emotive the subject.

I feel like each of the main political parties are mirror images of one another, in a way not unlike, but not as bad as the situation in the United States.

I think if a larger chunk of the population got involved in voting, I think the system in Westminster could be shaken up substantially and real change on key issues could be made which more evenly reflect the views of the populace. Instead what we have is a room full of career politicians who seem so far removed from real people.

I'm not sure if I'm rambling a bit here, but I think a more politically active population would help solve a lot of the issues mentioned in this thread, provided they were sufficiently educated. One of the things I get a bit tin-foily about is the amount of sway the papers hold over the public. I've never seen any statistics or anything, but I have a feeling (hence the tinfoil) that if the people printing the papers want to change the public's opinion on something, it wouldn't be that hard for them at all.

When I was younger I didn't really think that it was a problem.

I went on (from an underfunded secondary) to a private school, university, high-paying job and pretty much forgot how badly off so many people were. After leaving that job, and volunteering and working in charities and schools over the past few years, I fully realised how much that for many, many people in this country the 'do it yourself' option simply isn't open to them, and that, however hard they try, they and their children are trapped by forces they can't control in the circumstances of their birth.

When I meet friends from uni or school who've gone on to politics (of both wings), I can't fathom how their lives of comfort can square up to the daily struggle that so many people face. I see the policies of the main parties, and I feel so disillusioned. I probably sound like a champagne socialist, or a smugly 'enlightened', London-dwelling hypocrite.

Which is [more than a rape victim would get today](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/wife-wins-damages-for-rape-1238312.html). The reason it was a fine is because a rape would make a girl unmarriable so she would need to stay with her fathers house, which would be a burden. Paying a fine would ensure that she was not left high and dry. Remember, this was 3500 years ago, when this was written we were still getting to grips with using metal rather than stone, and Stonehenge was still being built.

It's also worth pointing out that the old testament is in the modern Christian bible as a back story, not a guide to how things should be done. Jesus brought in a new covenant with new rules, and part of that was handing over the laws regarding things like rape to civil authorities rather than having religious laws about it.

Edit: I was thinking of something else (looong time since I read the bible). The rapist must marry the victim (because no one else will after the rape) and pay the father. Which would cover the dowry the father would not get for his daughter. The dowry is to ensure that the wife can be supported in the event her husband dies (which quite frankly would be a common problem 3500 years ago).",0,1401751791,null,0,1401759337,0,chxlpgz,t3_274m7c,t1_chxlpgz,t1_chxdgal,null,1434066824,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

As a purely hypothetical situation, and from a utilitarian perspective, that makes perfect sense. But in the real world, if OP doesn't come and get treatment, that money won't get spent on foreign aid instead.

""cs30u
I AM THE LANDLORD OF THE PROPERTY and want to take this opportunity to make people aware of the on-going situation between my two tenants and I. Firstly I would like to condemn the attack on my front window and state that this is not in relation to any on-going issues. I have been taking LEGAL steps to evict my tenants from the property as they are 3 months in arrears of their rent payments. I have applied for a court order but this will take months maybe years to come threw. I am not racist in any way as I welcomed these people into my house in the first place, however they are now in breach other there tenancy agreement by not paying me rent. I have also contacted the police on two separate criminal issues. One of my tenants illegally forged a letter from me verifying him to be homosexual, I was not aware of this letter being sent to the home office which has subsequently granted him stay in the UK until 2019. Furthermore there is a court hearing for ""power NI"" to be granted a warrant to enter the house to investigate the electric meter which I suspected to be stuck or by-passed. NIE engineers were not granted access into the house when they called last week. As a landlord I have a duty of care toward any tenant I allow into my house, I have tried of various occasions to contact my tenants to arrange a time for servicing the boiler and PET test the electric but unable to do this. The tenants had me arrested 3 weeks ago claiming I racially abused them and asked them to pay there rent, I was not in the street and the alleged time. Furthermore they have stated quiet clearly that they are fully up to date with rental payments but this cannot be possible as I am now not allowed to enter the street to collect rent. I have now had to suspend my mortgage payments which will now affect any credit in the future. There is always two sides to every story so before people come on the media spotlight to express there disgust and what is happening please take on board my issues and see that I am the victim. Like I said before while all this is on-going, I totally condemn any acts of violence and what has occurred on sunday.""

true,tree_bear,lfc99,,"I love Flanno. He's great. But he's not the future at right back and I wish a lot more fans would get some perspective on this.

Flanno has overachieved and performed admirably but if we compare him with Moreno, we see what Rodgers is really looking for in a full back: pace, vision and movement going forward, and creating chances. In many ways the fullbacks are the most important position to our offensive shape because they push up so damn high, which is brilliant. Rodgers seems to be looking for hybrid fullback/wingback players like Dani Alves with a lot of creativity and attacking instincts.

Flanno has overachieved but if you look at his football skill set he doesn't make the grade of what we're looking for. He has ok defensive instincts but has made several crucial marking mistakes on set pieces which led to goals (Glen does this too and it drives me fucking insane). Going forward, Flanno is still learning but I don't see vision or pace or nous. He struggles to find a pass and even though he had ""dat turn"" it's not like he's going to be taking people on with the ball at his feet.

This post will probably come off as harsh because everyone loves Flanno, how can you not? But I don't think an overachieving player and then a bunch of other unproven players (Kelly, Wisdom, etc.) can paper over the gigantic crack that is Glen Johnson. This is why I think a right back should be a priority for us as well.
