&gt;  As unthinkable as it seems there’s a tiny speck of me that understands why one in seven of the British jihadists who have gone to Iraq and Syria are women. I must stress that I’m horrified by Isil and its radicalised version of Islam that stands for nothing but depravity, murder and savagery - when the religion I know only teaches peace, inclusion and love. Feeling marginalised does not of course justify acts of terrorism.
&gt; 
&gt; However, what I do understand, is the desperate search to find a place where you belong – the human desire to be listened to and valued is incredibly strong. For me the only place where I feel like I belong is with my three Muslim sisters who are my best friends, my confidantes and my biggest allies – this is despite having been born and educated in supposedly multicultural and tolerant Britain.
&gt; 
&gt; I can talk to my sisters about arranged marriage without them thinking it’s archaic and oppressive. We’ll often chat about God, religion and prayer together, without worrying about being seen as madwomen who hobnob with the fairies that live in our back gardens.
&gt; 
&gt; Aged 31, working as a SEO content writer in London, I would always prefer to have a Pepsi in a Pizza Hut with my siblings than go to a bar and attempt to schmooze with a tipsy boss when I’m perfectly sober and dying to go to bed.
&gt; 
&gt; My experience of being a British Asian Muslim and feeling like ‘the other’ in the country I was born in has led me to create this microcosm of family friendships, despite my parents moving here from Pakistan some 40 years ago.
&gt; 
&gt; You see I’ve had too many typical ‘awkward race moments’in the UK - such as walking into a cafe in a predominantly white area and being ignored. Or feeling embarrassed when friends tell me I’m no fun because I choose not to drink. Once my exam results were mixed up with the only other Asian girl in my class at university and I was told I had failed, when in fact, she had.
&gt; 
&gt; I’ve been horrified by someone throwing a strange liquid on me from a passing car as I walked down the street, forcing me to rush home and shower. And I’ve felt pushed into a corner to discuss arranged marriage and virginity in work environments by men who felt they could ask me about my sex life just because I am a Muslim woman.
&gt; 
&gt; Moments like these wake you up from feeling like part of the gang. You realise that you were never in the members’ circle. Just like the fat kid at school who was the last one to be picked for the rounders’ team and never caught the ball, despite having her hands outstretched for the duration of play.
&gt; 
&gt; And these small things, when piled high, can hurt. Quiet judgement still exists and it’s hard to be open, honest and truly yourself when you’re faced with ridicule, misinterpretation, anger and sometimes, even just blind curiosity from others.
&gt; 
&gt; I hate to admit this but it's just easier to be friends with people who share your beliefs and your skin colour. They’ve faced the same prejudices and they recognise your life because they’re living it.
&gt; 
&gt; I’ll concede that I can’t be bothered to start new friendships because they inevitably begin with the same questions about race, religion and politics that I’m tired of answering. So when my personal space is about to be encroached on, I choose to retreat before attack, which isn't doing me any favours. Being bad at maintaining friendships is not something that I’m over the moon about. Most of the relationships I have are only surface-deep where I tend to shy away from discussing my private life. I wish I was better at it but I simply don’t feel comfortable.
&gt; 
&gt; I think it’s the same for many children of immigrants in the UK - who cherish having a comforting group of friends that they can turn to when they feel jaded by judgement and anxious about divulging personal opinions in a space where they may not be welcomed. Today’s British Asian Muslim women are met with a three-pronged pitchfork of prejudice: the intersectional abrasions of racism, sexism and religious discrimination are enough to make anyone run for the hills and hunker down with a pair of heavy duty earplugs. With political parties like Ukip and the BNP banging on the door, spouting vile diatribes about the evils of immigration, it’s little wonder that we don’t want to answer the call to integrate.
&gt; 
&gt; Many Muslim women even feel apprehensive about revealing their personal identity, which means the onus is on others to make them feel welcomed and included so that they can feel comfortable enough to share. And once they do contribute they shouldn’t be singled out for speaking up.
&gt; 
&gt; As mother of a two-year old little girl, I hope things will be different for my daughter. I really do. With every generation, people from immigrant backgrounds tend to integrate further. I doubt she will learn Urdu from me but I still want Islam to be a part of her life because it's a massive part of mine. I want her to feel comfortable making friends but at the same time be confident enough not to hide her own opinions about faith and Islam. Being different to the majority makes you silent sometimes but I want her to have a voice. And be proud of it.
&gt; 
&gt; We’ve got all the tools here to create a cohesive society that values the individual – we just need to learn how to use them.
&gt; 
&gt; Running away to Syria is not going to help build a better future for Muslim women in the UK. Far from it. However, I think the Persian poet Rumi put it perfectly when he wrote: “It may be that the satisfaction I need depends on my going away, so when I’ve gone and come back, I’ll find it at home.”

false,Snoron,cnty-england,Bradford,"Isn't the issue that ""pointing out that boys usually prefer these toys"" is actually part of the reason why boys usually prefer these toys in the first place, though? If not absolutely, the issue is that if you stick to these traditional gender roles in your marketing then you do effectively perpetuate their existence. ""Boys usually prefer these toys because we keep telling everyone that they are for boys"" is not a very good argument, in my opinion.

Whether they are ""sexist"" might depend on your point of view of strength of the term, though.

In a legal sense these signs are fine - they are not directly sexist in the most serious sense of the word. That is, they are not a) refusing to sell them to/for girls, or b) presenting any immediate obstacle or unfairness based on gender (""get a 10% discount if you're a boy!"" for example, would be a most serious form of sexism).

Of course that may fall foul of the law, and to the point where no one would do it in the first place.

However from a social equality point of view, and in order to prevent the perpetuation of traditional gender roles (which are a major cause of sexism, too), they can still be viewed as sexist: While Tesco isn't discriminating directly, they are still doing their part to promote the source of a lot of sexist discrimination.

The point isn't if this one specific 7 year old girl was angry about the sign. It's that if any 7 year old girl anywhere is put off getting any of these toys because they are in a ""boys section"" then you do have a problem. Of course if you think that traditional gender based roles are all great and whatever, then you may not even see an issue with this. But if you think it's a social responsibility to help them diminish, then you may support what Tesco are doing, as more than anything it's a move of social responsibility. (Either that or just a business move, but it's essentially the same thing when customers force social responsibility onto a company).",0,1417112110,null,0,false,0,cmemgq3,t3_2nl4yp,t1_cmemgq3,t1_cmekvy0,null,1425814059,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Had he been a speed demon, he could have made up ground. But he isnt, therefore he cant get back to position quickly. 

Part of it is down to Gerrard being played as a DM which is down to our philosopher of a manager. Gerrard does not have the legs to cover ground and close down runners from midfield into the box, thus leaving the CBs hopelessly exposed. 

Agreed he's run a lot this year has Gerrard, but that's simply because he hasnt been positioned well to begin with and has not read the game well or has been marked out of the game by teams. Truth is he;s not good enough anymore to contribute anything to this team at this moment in time. 

Lovren needs better cover, which seemed the case last year at Southampton. However it;'s interesting to note Lovren has played behind some decent midfielders in his time at Lyon and S'Hampton. At Lyon he had some good readers of the game in front of him. At S'Hampton he had sheer brute force and a wall of a DMF in front of him in Wanyama and a good box to box MF in Schneiderlin. 

I think with the right midfield, he will prosper. He is coming under tremendous pressure repeatedly on the field, and that;s causing him to make some glaring errors and his confidence isnt helping. If you noticed last night, Kolo was defending on the front foot, which is what Lovren tends to do. Kolo had confidence, Lovren doesnt. Most of Kolos moves came off, Lovren is failing at them. 

But like I said, I think with the right midfield, importantly a balanced midfield, Lovren will do well. Lovren needs to be left to do what Lovren does best and that is read and pick up danger quickly, stick to his man and clear the situation quickly.

I asked my dad, who's a foodie beer drinker. There are lots of cooking with beer and homebrewing books about. If he has an affinity for a particular area of Europe, you could look out for a culinaria of that country. There's also the World Beer Guide. If he likes or collects books about food or beer, apparently the pre-war stuff is the really fun stuff, particularly anything pre-1920s; these can be a lot cheaper than you might think because it's quite a niche collector's market. I don't know if you can tell at this point where I get my bibliophilic tendencies from. Abebooks is probably going to be your best bet online. Delivery times can be long though.

Immigration Up - Public services and Nhs grow to service the larger communities. New housing built for larger communities. 

What's actually happening in my opinion is that the boost to the economy that immigration is bringing is being syphoned off by big business and government and not being spent where it should.

He suggested that instead of QE we should make everyone over the age of 55 retire. In exchange everyone who retired would be given £1m pounds. He reckoned he had costed this and it would cost a bit less than QE had cost first time around, yet with no apparent effect.

There were conditions to receiving your £1m apart from retiring, which by itself should sort out the unemployment problem for younger people. 

Additionally every single person or couple would have to buy a new house to live in. This one got the then stagnant housing market moving.

Every single person or couple had to buy a British built car every three years.  This addressed the stagnant car industry. 

Everybody who got the million had to eat out once a week.

All very radical but at a glance it did seem to address the main problems in the economy that QE singularly failed to do.

But what is really horrible, that he was basically forced to take that ""option""? Not really, it's that he never did something that should have been considered a crime in the first place.

If we're properly comfortable with what is and isn't a crime, and if there's an option available that will make you no longer a threat to society, then it almost seems more fair to offer that to a person if it will help them with an issue they have.

Imagine you had some serious issue that caused you random outbursts of violence for example. Imagine there was a drug you could take daily to stop it happening. Imagine you kept getting in trouble with the law due to harming people, and you've now caused GBH and are getting sentenced to 5 years. Forget it being offered as an ""option"", wouldn't you be personally asking for this drug by name? Hell, you might have even done this years ago and never got to the point of a prison sentence in the first place.

Now imagine if someone told you sorry, this drug exists but you're not having it, you're basically going to continue like this for the rest of your life and there's nothing me, you, or anyone else can do about it. Kinda sucks, eh?

Now onto sentences - sure you've committed a crime and should serve whatever the sentence is for it. But you know people get parole - people can get out on good behaviour. People can be released if they're deemed no longer a threat to the public.

So the treatment doesn't have to automatically come with the condition of a reduced sentence. But considering that your situation would change to the point where you're no longer a threat to the public, for example, that would be taken into account when you are considered for release.

false,memorekz,eng-Eastanglia,East Anglia,"QE money went into the banks, as it was used solely to buy government bonds from the bond market. The way it works is this: 

1. Government sells £375bn in bonds to banks, at say 2% (the percentage is actually decided by reverse auction, but for arguments sake, we'll go with a nice easy number) 
2. Bank of England creates cash from nowhere (QE)
3. Bank of England buys Government bonds from the banks, and effectively becomes a guarantor of government debt
4. Government pays interest on bonds to the Bank of England, who then pays it back to the government on an annual basis. 
5. Banks have £375bn in their coffers that didn't exist previously, and the government gets to borrow interest free. 

Now the idea was that this free £10bn would serve two purposes; the first is to shore up the ailing bank balance sheets to protect the banks from external shocks such as bad debts. Several banks were in quite precarious positions, and thus the cash injections from the Bank of England were not passed on, merely kept in the bank to cushion the blow from bad debts. The other purpose was to provide the banks with very cheap money to lend out to businesses, in the hope that this would ease the credit shortage and grease the wheels of commerce once more. However, this only partially worked, as the banks too this very cheap money from the Bank of England, and then cherry picked only the safest lending, and raised the interest rate paid by the borrower hugely. The disconnect between what they were paying for their money (to the Bank of England, amongst others) was very very low, and the price charged to borrowers was exceptionally high, and that created a big profitable sandwich in the middle.

So the Bank of England magic'ed £375bn out of thin air, and that went on providing cheap borrowing for the government, and float for the banks, but almost none of it made it to the consumers, and this is the problem we have now. 

If we had taken the other route, and put the QE cash straight into people's pockets, then the banks would have been refinanced via small investors, and the economy would be driven by demand, but pumping money directly into people's pockets tends to push inflation higher than the way our government and central bank did it, and it was only a couple of years ago that inflation reached 5%.

false,gangstafrog,null,null,"Lovren's biggest issue for me is positioning. 

In every single match he's played, there have been numerous occasions where he is just wildly out of position, often lingering in these places for far longer than makes sense. What kills me, personally, about it, isn't that he's just out of position - It's how he interacts with the team. 

Many, many times I've noticed him within a couple of yards of someone else, someone who isn't Skrtel. He's often very wide, while the fullbacks are either near (in their position as the opponents advance) or covering where they should be as Lovren stays over in the area, which almost always yields some kind of ball played into the space he's in. This is especially painful when Johnson is closer to the other goal than our own and Lovren is off unreliably doing something..else. But really, it's just as painful when he's hovering over Moreno.

Skrtel's been working overtime whenever Lovren plays, to cover more space than he has the legs for. Nobody, including himself, think he's speedy (Skrtel) but you still find him sort of alone, or with Gerrard near. 

In his first couple of games (friendlies included), his passing actually looked pretty nice. Good forward ground passes, reaching targets with pace and accuracy. That seemed to be a parlor trick, as he seems to mostly just pass to Skrtel. If not Skrtel, either back or horizontal to the fullbacks. He's tried some long passes here and there, few of which have been accurate (and are often short, to the feet of Sterling, who's at least got the sense most of the time to play ahead of his man because that's the only way he's gonna win it..)

Fortunately he's not a foul-machine or anything, he doesn't murder people game after game or anything. He doesn't offer much on offensive corners, and he's the biggest liability I've seen in a while on defensive ones. His reactions seem slow, his reading of the game seems lacking (see positional coverage for 1v1s, missing the flight path of the ball, bad decision making [ie: coming out of position near a fullback to sweep and just clearing the ball rather than playing what is almost always a relatively short, safe pass], marking anyone who isn't slower than him) and just..yeah.

See, I went and searched for a compo of him and clicked one of the first I saw, just in case I was getting too down on him and forgot what he can do. Yeah, okay, not the world's worst player, but: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRYox6UIH-A

Even much of this vid looks fortunate, kind of random and by watching this, you wouldn't even think he was a CB from many of these clips. The clips where he's in a CB's position, doing actual defending (ie: heading a ball out of the box), it still doesn't even look all that great. Lots of, same example, headed balls outta the box that go only a few yards away, or are aimed at a teammate being marked or double marked.

All in all, as a reasonable example of people coming good, he reminds me of Henderson in his first calender year. So, so many times I was left just asking ""why"", not even horrible passes or terrible mistakes or anything, just..decisions that I find questionable.

Modqueue is active, mod mail is active. The stickied post I made was my error, simply because i browse on my phone the majority of the time and it didn't show.

&gt; New, active mods who are actually going to do their job

It's a voluntary position, we don't get a penny or thanks for reading through the ""intolerant crap"". Maybe our skin is too thick and we aren't sensitive enough to realise that people might get a hernia reading someone elses opinion, especially on why a bit of land belongs to their people. Maybe we all are so scarred from the troubles we need guardians and protectors to censor what the bold boys are saying, or as a community we could, you know, downvote and report.

The post is 4 hours old and other mods are already actively engaging in this conversation. We are active. Just because you can't see us, doesn't mean we aren't there.

I've seen it in many threads before people commenting on this being a one sided majority sub, can any tell me for definite the build up of the mod team or are we that unbiased? Both extremes and everyone in between has the opportunity to publish an opinion, we don't give a shit what the opinion is, you don't even have to all get along, the community is in control and is steering this vessel. We can't reiterate that enough. You reading this are responsible for content.

Have I any issues with the team makeup? Short answer is yes. There is an imbalance in what work individual mods do and what they add to the community. You only have to check the mod mail and mod queue to see that. Is it a problem? does it detract from the reddit experience? Is our community deteriorating into a Lurgan sized pit of turd? Nope.

Nearly 5,000 subscribers.

Get a fork and spike down the length, pour vinegar in and let it sink down into the wee holes, heat in the microwave until it smells like Lagan Valley Swimming Pool, pour a wee dollop of brown sauce on.

The cats out of the bag now folks, i'm no longer unbiased.

After that the game went into a dull where both teams were playing like shit and we started to drop deeper and deeper as the game went on. Sterling should have sealed the win but missed and after that I think all the supporters had the same thought in mind ""This is gonna cost us the win"".

I've heard that he was basically booted out of his previous team due to his errors, but he had a fantastic season last season both in a defensive unit and individually that makes me believe he's not just a terrible CB who had a lucky good season but someone who has the necessary skills to be a great defender but needs the correct system in which to flourish. 

What's for certain is that we're currently not the correct system, and neither is Skrtel the best partner.

The point I was clumsily trying to make was that the problem isn't just one of supply, but that by increasing the capacity and volume of roads you increase how much the roads are used and you soon end up in the same place. That's why I was emphasising that investing in infrastructure that supports alternatives to car is better for car users as well as it takes some of the pressure off the roads. 

I completely agree that public transport is incredibly important to get right and it is awful here in Bristol. It really drags the whole city down. 

Agree with you completely on the whole equity thing, regarding people that have fewer options to avoid car use.

Raheem and Hendo are linking up well, and Lambert seems to be gaining a bit of confidence with each passing day. Still, a combination of Stevie and Rickie down the center was far too slow and too weak on the press, even with the bits of magic every once in a while.

Coutinho masturbating on the bench.

Shambolic set-piece defending as per usual. 

Brendan's substitutions might have been ill-advised: Raheem was our main attacking threat, but he looked dead on his feet when he was substituted for Moreno. Could have gone either way. Problem was he only used one substitution out of three and left Stevie on for the full 90.

We have three upcoming fixtures against three relatively weak sides prior to our next CL fixture. To get anything less than 7 points out of the 9 will be considered a failure.

And as I've said previously, I was not allowed to work off-campus during my year, under my F-1 Visa. After the first year, I would have been entitled to only:

&gt; F-1 students may engage in three types of off-campus employment, after they have been studying for one academic year. These three types of employment are:

&gt; * Curricular Practical Training (CPT)
* Optional Practical Training (OPT) (pre-completion or post-completion)
* Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Optional Practical Training Extension (OPT)

[^(Source)](http://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/students-and-exchange-visitors/students-and-employment)

The information is right there. It's clearly far more difficult to get work in the US under a student visa, when compared to here. 

As for their concerns of capacity, it's general capacity in terms of accommodation, stresses on public services and so forth. I can't speak for them, however, as I am not of that mindset. I just listen to both sides of the discussion.

All my bike savvy friend are in a different city. And like you, I have only owned one bike before and it was new Honda from the dealership and nowhere near as complicated as a used Aprilia (as the forums suggest).

I went to my local Motorbike Riding centre (where I passed my exam) and spoke to a couple of the guys there if they knew of anyone who would be happy to come and look at a bike with me. One of the instructors was happy to do it, I sent him the link and asked him to have a look before to make sure before going to see the bike we were not wasting each others time. He helped me inspect the bike, point out any defects, checked out the paperwork and helped me bargain the price saving me around £300. 

Thankfully, all went smoothly on the day and I left the seller with my bike and peace of mind. I gave the geezer £40 for his help (even though he only asked for enough to cover him for a drink) and over the weeks he's been helping me out with all my bike related questions, recommending mechanics, equipment and local meet ups.

Good luck!

I didn't know much at all after only a year on a 125, and I don't think I know a great deal now after 3-4 years.

For one thing, in order to stay compliant with FFP, the club would have to sell a lot of players. Messi's release clause is €200MM+, so we would need to generate a lot of income from player transfers to offset that. You could argue that we would gain a lot of revenue.

Once you get past the financial aspect, the squad will have changed drastically. Right now the system we use has a true striker, and Messi fits more into a false-nine system. What effect does that have on Diego Costa's role [assuming he didn't get sold, see above]?

Also, this is just a gut feeling, but I feel like Hazard may want to leave if he is playing alongside Messi - obviously I have nothing to back that up, it's just a gut feeling.

I'm not suggesting that race is what the headlines should make reference to, it is just that you can be sure race will definitely be mentioned in some news outlets if the perpetrator is non-white whereas race will not be mentioned if the person is white.

I guess in this recent case the cultural angle is possibly significant and it would be expected that it would would be mentioned, but when the perpetrators of any crime are white British in large numbers, we rarely question (or mention) the culture or racial origin as being significant. A rare example of an exception to this is perhaps a few years ago with football violence, where it was possible almost to feel the collective national hurt at the thought that white British culture might be in the wrong.

A further thought is that maybe the white British culture is responsible for creating a group of vulnerable young people but that does not seem to be considered in any headline.

false,bcash,null,null,"QE was never about ""getting people spending"" or ""putting money where it's needed"" - although this was what the politicians at the time were saying, no economist who advocated it had this as their goal.

But neither was it a ""give money to the banks"" move either.  There has been plenty such moves: the various troubled-asset schemes, and the bailouts themselves of course.

QE is about controlling interest rates.  (Buy this I mean not the Bank of England rates, but rates available to borrow and lend in the economy as a whole.)

The effective rate on a government bond is set by supply and demand just like everything else, the bond has a face value of £100, with a set dividend, but the actual price is set at auction.  The real interest rate is determined by the selling price - the dividend and the redemption price are set, so the cheaper you can buy it, the more you make.

So as the government needed more money, with fewer people willing to buy, they would have had to offer a higher dividend on bonds to raise the money.  This would have had two really bad consequences:

1. Making public finances even worse than they are already, and they're bad enough as it is.

2. They would have been competing against the rest of the economy for funds, and ended up starving them too.  Why buy corporate bonds at 5% if the government is offering 4.75%?

Hence QE.  QE buys government bonds at face value, the dividend doesn't have to go up, everyone's happy.

The other advantage of QE vs. ""cash bombing"" is that QE can be reversed (probably won't be, but could be) when and if inflation kicks off.  The Bank of England can sell the government bonds it owns into the open market, effectively destroying the cash it raises.  If money were simply printed the only way of controlling any inflation outbreaks would be for the Bank to put up base rates.",0,1417122144,null,0,false,0,cmequvp,t3_2nl1kx,t1_cmequvp,t3_2nl1kx,null,1425812009,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;The __casual__ [subculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subculture) is a subsection of [association football culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football_culture) that is typified by [football hooliganism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_hooliganism) and the wearing of expensive [designer clothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designer_clothing)      (known as ""clobber""). The subculture originated in the United Kingdom in the early 1980s when many hooligans started wearing designer clothing labels and expensive sportswear in order to avoid the attention of police and to intimidate rivals. They did not wear club colours, so it was allegedly easier to infiltrate rival groups and to enter [pubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pub). Some casuals have worn clothing items similar to those worn by [mods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod_(subculture\)). Casuals have been portrayed in films and television programmes such as *[ID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I.D._(1995_film\))*, *[The Firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Firm_(1989_film\))* and *[The Football Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Factory_(film\))*.

Everton are probably one of the better ones and have had a couple of referendums, one on the stadium move to Kirby and the other on the new badge. However, they don't let supporters dictate policy or personnel like what often happens in Italy or Turkey. It has perhaps allowed Cardiff's owner was allowed to change their kits to red in spite of significant opposition and Hull City AFC nearly had their name changed to Hull Tigers.

That doesn't mean there's a bad or subdued atmosphere.  think that would be a separate issue. It's not the loudest in Europe but is it has it's moments and is perhaps more influenced by what is going on during the game than near-constant singing. Away support is usually better than home.

Among the challenges to supporter culture is the fact that premier league football is becoming more and more of a product and clubs often cater to families or corporate packages, and that can subdue the support. Perhaps that's price of the having the highest quality league. Additionally banners are often confiscated on the way in, pyro is a no-no, as is alcohol, there are thousands of banning-orders and stewards can kick people out who refuse to sit-down. However it has improved safety immeasurably.

I'm glad that the USA is developing a supporter culture although I hope it grows organically and authentically from the bottom-up. There's nothing cringier than seeing culture and practices imported, whitewashed, sanitised and badly reproduced. Keep at it.

Normal / Sensitive / Red / Anti-Aging

Red, sensitive, dehydrated skin showing the signs of aging requires a careful blend of smoothing exfoliants and calming bioactive ingredients to soothe and strengthen the skin from inside out. High concentrations of Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate (the no-sting form of Vitamin C), White Tea and Red Marine Algae provide incredible anti-aging nourishment to reveal smooth, calm and comfortable skin with less visible redness. The result? Beautiful skin by Renée Rouleau.

Symptoms of Skin Type 5:

- Has consistent redness or rosacea

- Produces oil in the summer, mostly in t-zone

- Skin can feel tight or dry during the winter

- Needs hydration without heavy oils or pore-clogging ingredients

- May have enlarged pores mostly in t-zone, including blackheads

- Skin that gets irritated easily, especially by harsh products

- Wants to keep skin healthy and smooth with less visible redness

- May have hyperpigmentation (brown spots)

- Concerned about aging

Generally someone ages 30s-50s where gentle, lightweight products are required yet anti-aging is a concern. Not sure?""

No idea where the blackheads/ large pores thing came from, no I don't have an issue with that (comedones are not part of papulopustular rosacea) and I didn't say my skin was oily or dry.

Let's not draw too many conclusion from this. My overarching point: football isn't as simple as these types of things make out.

Moving the play 50/60 yards up the pitch and away from your goal is valuable. He shows percentages of attempted/failed long balls. Those failures aren't necessarily failures. They're failed passes in the strictest sense, but remember Rodgers' first season when we always ""won the passing""? Connecting passes isn't everything. This sub is the perfect example of this point actually. We bitch incessantly about keeping pointless possession in our half just waiting for someone to fuck up and come under heavy fire from opposition attackers. Bypassing 6/7 of the opposition's 11 players alleviates 99% of the inherent risk in having possession of the ball. Not only is the ball in the opposition's half of the pitch but the team is in a safe position because we still have 8-10 men behind the ball and time to reorganise. The raking pass may not lead directly to goals but it is an invaluable strategic tool to have in a midfielder's locker. 

Now think about the men being bypassed. If we're playing Arsenal and Gerrard goes for a Hollywood ball that gets comfortably intercepted by Mertesacker running towards his own goal, what happens next? Probably nothing either way. If Gerrard tries to squeeze a pass out wide to a fullback or into Hendo's feet and Sanchez snips it out, what happens now? Some combination of Ozil, Walcott, Sanchez, Cazorla, Giroud, Chamberlain, Ramsey come bearing down on Lovren and Skrtel and I shit my pants. The type of opposition player you remove from the play matters. I'd rather have their defenders trying to play out between our attackers then our defenders trying to play out between theirs (time and a place, of course). If you believe in a Guardiola-esque scheme of keeping the ball at all costs, then the raking pass may not be helpful to your plans, but, generally speaking, the worst that happens is you lose possession in an area of little to no danger where a fullback or center back is isolated on the ball.

Let's put it this way. I could say that the odds of scoring from 25+ yards are incredibly small based on how rarely those shots go in, but is there then no value in taking those shots? Of course there is. If you can illustrate to the opposition that you pose a threat from that distance, the opposition have to monitor that threat and it pulls a midfielder, occasionally a CB, out of position opening up space in and around the 18-yard box for us to open up a higher-percentage shot. Similarly, if you demonstrate, as Gerrard has, that you are capable of a raking 60-yard ball that will land at feet if not monitored, the opposition has to alter their pressing tactics and fullback positioning. This, I think, explains why Juve, Bayern, Barca, Madrid, United, Milan, Dortmund, and Liverpool compose 8 of the top 11 teams in terms of percentage: they have other weapons in their lockers which open up space for this pass and for which this type of pass opens up space. In chess, do you expect every move to lead to taking out the king within 3 moves? In American football, why do they both run and throw the ball? Why don't they choose the more statistically effective option? Why do we assume in advanced statistics that everything has to lead to a goal/shot within x number of seconds/passes/transitional phases in order to be effective? When Gerrard gets on the ball, the opposition fullbacks have to be switched on. They can't bomb forward or squeeze the midfield like they generally could if someone like Lucas or Allen get on the ball who don't really have this pass in their locker. This isn't accounted for in the analysis because no one has time to analyze all of these variables. What is the correlation between average opposition fullback position and which player is in midfield and how many diagonal long balls they attempt and whether they are successful and whether the team benefits from the opposition having to adapt to a raking pass threat? Who the fuck knows?

Further, the stats he gives involve some loose positive/negative designations. What if an intercepting defender fails to control the ball cleanly and the passing team can put them under pressure? Pressuring the opposition into rushed play near their own goal is not a ""positive""? What if the ball is cleared back to your player who now has more space and/or is in a more advanced position than if you had rolled it into feet? But the pass was intercepted and cleared, so that's a ""negative"" even though there was a net benefit. If you concede a foul or just lose possession but relieved immense pressure, was it really negative or ineffective? When does the advantage from gaining 60 yards of pitch position or gaining time to reorganize your defense, or having the opposition scrambling the ball around the back sloppily end? 

Lastly, the type of pass needs to be defined much more carefully. The 60 yard balls from Shawcross or Huth to Crouch are a very different type of ball than a 60 yard pass from Gerrard to Suarez, Sturridge, or Sterling and have no business being lumped together. I understand that there are limitations on the data available, but any generalization is unfair. I don't think a 70-yard Huth screamer off of Crouch's forehead gets applauded too vigorously.

**TL;DR**: A clearance + potential immediate transition to attack is a tactical weapon which should not be ignored. The underlying assumption seems to be that there is a better option available every time this pass is attempted and that clearing/relieving pressure is not inherently ""positive"". There's much work to be done in advanced statistics/analytics for sport.

Yeah that's the one, my bad. 

Not my system by the way, I don't really think it's a great idea. STEM degrees in this country are (or at least were. My year were the last people to get degrees on the ~£3k loans) pretty good value.

I think the idea though is that the STEM graduate doesn't pay. They have to remain in the UK for 5 years and pay taxes in that time. The debt then gets written off (any difference for fees already paid reimbursed I presume) and said STEM graduate can do what they want with regards to moving abroad. I guess your point is that this can be avoided entirely if the STEM grad moves abroad in the first place but having this scheme would provide more of an incentive to stay than if it wasn't there, and to be honest it's not like there are floods of UK STEM graduates fleeing the country. If the goal of the scheme would be to attract foreign students to say, then I guess it doesn't work that much, though the writing off of student debt is still an incentive and would mean they wouldn't default to returning home.

Firstly, this is technically correct: grand total TWh exceeded Nuclear's. Importantly, however, this has been a bad year for Nuclear power: both Hunterston and Torness went through 'Statutory Outages' this year, turning their reactors off for a period of time for inspection and maintenance. Nuclear has not been performing to standard this year as a result.

Secondly, while total TWh produced may exceed Nuclear, that doesn't mean they can be replaced. Power generation and demand has to be matched in real time, which is one of the major issues being worked on for intermittent generation sources such as wind energy.

Icardi and Batshuayi are quality, but Icardi will not be cheap from Inter and Batshuayi only transferred this summer for 6 million, which I could see Marseiile tripling to sell him so soon. He hasn't had a great season so far, scoring just once in eight appearances, but I watched him last year in the Belgian Pro League and he could be at Benteke or Lukaku's level in a couple of years. In some areas he's more developed than Divock Origi.

Soriano and Bacca aren't worth it to me. Sure, they're scoring goals, but they wouldn't be an improvement over Ade or Soldado due to age. Bacca played for Club Brugge a couple years back and while he was prolific, he wasn't a stand out football player in a mediocre league.

Dybala is a gamble, but might come cheaper than Palermo wants. He could prove to be another gem, but I don't think Spurs is at a place they can afford another flop or to wait several years for him to come good.

In the end, only Icardi is truly viable, but the only hope we have of signing him is if Inter's season continues to go badly and some rash decisions are made.

Really I see it as more of a personal issue, for example I really like Britain's green land, and I don't like villages being built on lots, I understand that this has to happen but I think with 260k+ people coming a year its going to speed it up. And I do think its made our wages stay lower than they could have been because of a cheap influx of labour.

I don't know many proper Christians or religious folk at all.

I only found out because someone else was joking about religion and he sort of stopped them and told them off a bit, which led to the person asking 'what, are you religious or something?' and he said yes, I believe in biblical creation and all that stuff. That teacher was only a few years older than me, so that's really the youngest person I know. I think there was one other girl in my extended class (We had like 6 classes full of students for the one subject more or less) who was a Jehovah's Witness, but again I never found out until someone asked.

Common problems with them is the OEM rectifiers being a bit dodgy. Mines suffering from the same issue (lights get brighter the more revs I give it etc) but hopefully it'll last up the MOT in March and I'll sort it then. 
Your best bet is to try and get one that's already had it replaced with a 3rd party one. If not, then it's not the end of the world. small price to pay for an otherwise perfect bike. 

Brakes can get a little bit of getting used. Mine (98-02) uses some kind of fancy mechanical ABS system that can make them feel a little bit vague and then suddenly sharp at low speeds, but again, not really all that bad. 

Onto the good points:
Gear driven cams and a V4. What a beautiful sound. 

98-02 models were pre vtec, no yo!

Heavy, but feels as light as a feather when riding, even at slow speeds. 

Good mileage. I normally get around 170 miles to the tank commuting and around 200 motorway miles. Brimming the tank is around £20-£25 depending. 

Looks great. But unfortunately doesn't have the under tail exhaust. I've seen people that have modified them, however.

false,Jo3Fr3sh,newcr-1,Non arte sed marte,"The development of casuals/chavs/hooliganism culture in England is really interesting. It was a post war development where supporters would travel to support their side, away days. Transportation on the rail network in England was cheap as the country ran special trains for Saturday games. During a match the away side would try to run the home side supporters out of their own end. This grew until they were banned from the stadiums. During this time the word Firm was used to describe the organize group who would be involved in the battles with rival supporters. The catalyst for hooliganism has been tied to ManUs relegation from the first division during the 60s. 

The red army as the ManU firm was called would follow their team on away days and terrorize the towns in which they were playing, this hastened the development of hooliganism as supporters organized their own firms to defend themselves from ManU's very large firm. 

The success of Liverpool in the 70s and 80s, winning multiple first league championships, brought the liverpool's firm the Urchins to follow their team in Europe. It was when they played on the continent when liverpools firm would loot sporting goods stores and come back with designer gear unseen in England. 

Wearing designer clothing had an appeal for the casuals as they would be know soon after for two reasons. The first is they could not be easily identified by the authorities. The second is it appealed to the competitive nature of hooligan culture. Not only would a firm stand their ground and beat up on a rival firm but looking better then those other cunts had a universal street culture appeal. 

Eventually the police would work to limit hooliganism along with two big tragedies, Hillsborough and Heysel before, which would serve to turn the tied against the culture of hooliganism. Together with the development of the rave scene and ecstasy hooliganism faded into the background as the youth found a new bonding experience to unite around. The hard core hooligans began to follow the national side instead of their club. England then developed a bad reputation as their supporter would reek havoc around the continent.

Generally there is quite an insular culture in the UK church. I have plenty of friends who aren't Christians but the majority of my close friends are Christians because it's easier. Partially it's because I spend a lot of time with them in a social context - a beer down the pub after church easily turns into ""anyone fancy playing football on Friday"" or ""who wants to come round for a BBQ next week"" and partially because I feel more comfortable amongst other Christians where there's no pressure to do things Christians generally don't do (premarital sex, drugs, drunkenness etc.) It's a self reinforcing cycle and one that a lot of Christians find themselves in.

Also I would say that the culturally in the UK of you generally keep your beliefs to yourself, unless it's Christmas or Easter most people don't talk about it. That's not to say that I don't, pretty much everyone I know, knows I'm a Christian. Some are quite keen to talk about it others aren't and that's cool I never force the conversation but I'm happy to have a discussion or debate and I might occasionally invite you to a carol service.

If you want to get an idea of the numbers I can't tell you exact figures but having been to Christian festivals like Soul Survivor that have almost 30,000 young Christians in attendance each year and knowing that from every church I've been in the people going are in in the minority it feels to me like there are a lot of us.

As others have mentioned it does seem to be a class thing, most of the Christians I know are firmly middle class. Also as I mentioned elsewhere in this thread those churches with high numbers of young people tend to attract more young people (makes sense when you think about it) so you end up with a situation where a church will either have a lot of under 30s or practically none so it's easy to get the impression that there aren't many young people who go to church if your only exposure is to one of the latter.

So for most Americans, all of their religious education comes from church. And if you only go to church a few times a year, you might call yourself a Christian while retaining very little.

I also think it contextualizes the information differently. We learned about Greek mythology in high school, and I feel like Christianity is relevant for the same reason. It's had a huge impact culturally and there are biblical allusions scattered through literature and art. But for me, learning it at church kind of made it seem less important and relevant. It's presented differently. When I was little, it was ""let's learn about the story of so-and-so and then color a picture and talk about the moral of that person's story."" Whereas when you're an adult (in my experience in the protestant church), it's more like ""let's talk about gratitude, here's a funny anecdote about gratitude, here are some random verses where god says that gratitude is very important.""

I **said** that it would be very hard to find somebody who didn't have a conflict of interest. I didn't say **too** difficult. It can, and should be done, but it won't be easy.

&gt;My point is that Butler-Sloss and Woolf were obviously conflicted in a way that the vast majority of candidates would not be.

And **MY** point is that you are wrong. The vast majority of candidates would have a very similar conflict. You don't seem to realise this. The candidate to lead the enquiry has to have a certain political or legal standing to be in a position to persue the enquiry with suitable rigour. They have to interview and interrogate top civil servants, MPs, police commissioners, etc. Where do you think they will find somebody with the required clout? From 'the establishment'. In case you don't realise, these people all know each other. They are linked by family, and marriage, and careers through generations. They almost all have links to 'the establishment' of the 80s. Take Peter Wanless, who you mentioned previously as not given the clearance required to head his enquiry. Do you realise that he was a Civil Servant during the 80s? He worked for the government at the time, and so had a working relationship with many ministers currently in your list. He also recieved the Companion of the Order of the Bath in 2005's New Years Honours list, under the auspice of David Cameron.

Clearly a Conflict of Interest. See how easy that was?

In reference to Wanless not having the relevant security clearance, did you realise that was a non-issue, as the enquiry was jointly held by him and Richard Whittam QC, who has full security clearance. How do I know this? Because he is the top barrister conducting those 'secret trials' we keep hearing about. The ones which subvert our own laws about fair trial. He regularly works for the UK intelligence agencies and the Home Office, and has argued in court for the continuation of these secret trials. He has prosecuted for the government in Courts Martial trials and Official Secrets Act cases.

He was also already a barrister by 1983, and has had working relationships with a number of prominent barristers, MPs, Police and Armed Services personell of the 80s.

Clearly a Conflict of Interest.

Christmas plays (even secular ones) aren't really a tradition at state schools in the U.S. It's very common to see a nativity scene outside a church or for someone to set up the little figurines as part of their Christmas decorations, and it's definitely something you're going to hear about at church. I'm sure there are religious schools that put on plays at Christmas, but because the ""Christmas play"" isn't really an institution, you would have a harder time getting parents to make the time for it when they're already quite busy.

The closest we had to that when I was younger (in public school) was a Christmas concert where we sang Christmas songs.

If you asked ATOS they would say they don't make any decisions, just inform the DWP.

If you ask DWP they will just say ATOS haven't performed to the standards expected and the contract is being terminated. (Only for another company to come in and do the same thing...)

Clearly there must be some systemic reason ATOS tends to classify people who aren't fit to work as fit to work. But we'll never find it because they're a private company not subject to Freedom of Information Act and their contract is exempt from the act because it's ""commercially sensitive"".

If anything you'd expect them to want to class people as unfit to work as they'll get reassessed six or twelve months later.

All we have is a few testimonies from workers that there are quotas - or what corporate speak would call ""norms"" - no assessment centre should have an above average level of fit to work judgements. God knows how that's supposed to work.

DWP doesn't give ATOS any penalty for poor quality and probably don't pay them enough to give a damn about quality. DWP knows this and doesn't care. No wonder 60 percent of assessments get a C grade meaning they are of inadequate accuracy.

IDS pushed through the change from DLA (Disability Living Allowance) to PIP (Personal Independence Payment)

Under DLA you were judged on your ability to walk 200m as part of the mobilty section.  Under IDS 'fairer' PIP  - that distance has been reduced to 25m.

If you can walk 25m you will not qualify for the upper rate of mobility.

I've had 4 heart attacks, a stroke and I'm legally blind.  Because of the way my brain is damaged after the stroke, I can't leave the house alone at night because my brain can't interpret low light properly.   When I come to be assessed for PIP next year - I will lose my upper rate of mobility benefit, effectively only being able to leave the house on a weekly shopping trip as taxi fare will use up the entire allowance in one go.

300 Charities were consulted on the changes to the medical assessment - only 1 agreed the distance judged should be reduced, the other 295 were against it.  So the fucker reduced it.

ATOS only do the medical assessments, DSS staff make the decisions.  They are supposed to contact your hospital consultants for evidence, but they don't.  They ignore any letters from your GP.  They make their decision without access to your medical notes from hospital (even though you sign giving them permission to access them, they never do).

[School of Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jE0OUGzK8MQ)

*Roberto had a dream,*

*To build a football team,*

*We had no money so we signed our players on loan,*

*We play from the back,*

*With Ross in Attack,*

*The School of Science, is on it's way back!*

btw ""School of Science"" is a nickname Everton have always had which is to do with the slick passing style and attacking football we were known for, the song is basically saying Martinez has brought that style back to Everton.

[Allez Allez Allez oh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbzS87U3bsc)

*Allez Allez Allez oh*

*Allez Allez Allez oh*

*We're Everton FC, Roberto's blue army*

[We sign Samuel Eto'o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47-o5rUZhT0)

*This is what it's like to be Everton*

*This is what it's like to be ""small""*

*you sign Lambert, we sign Samuel Eto'o...*

This is a dig at our neighbours Liverpool who signed Rickie Lambert this summer.

Then there are the classics, like:

[Grand Old Team](http://youtu.be/6xSJflQRtt0?t=1m52s)

*It's a grand old team to play for,*

*It's a grand old team to support,*

*and if, you know, your history, it's enough to make your heart go whooooaaaa*

*we don't care what the red side say*

*What the heck do we care*

*'cause we only know that there's gonna be a show*

*when the Everton boys are there*

Those are the official words, some small words may change depending on who's singing it haha

You also occassionally hear people sing [Banks of the Royal Blue Mersey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKzhwih1IdQ) (just the first verse of this version) and the chorus of [Forever Everton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1cULU2COlw)

You could open up 25mill a year on wages alone and with the monetary stuff coming in then you could basically afford say 25mill over a 5 year contract. 150mill  to spend on a player when wages and transfer fee taken into account. Say messi would be on 300k a week, 15mill a year. Could spend 75 million for transfer but amortized without a presumption of increased revenue.

First of all, I'm not suggesting that there definitely *is* something significant about Danny's last name ... and I also *personally* wouldn't buy the red/pink symbolism posited by the OP (although ""Who Nose"", stranger things have happened).

But ... surely we weren't supposed to attach *zero* significance to the fact that within a single episode we were introduced to two brand new characters:

1) a male soldier named ""Pink"" (a baby **girl's** traditional color)  

and  

2) a female soldier named ""Blue"" (a baby **boy's** traditional color)?  

Yes, Journey Blue's story was probably over after that one episode, and so far as we know and from all indications, Danny's story ended in the season finale. Here after the season is over it's a lot easier to totally dismiss this stuff as nothing.

But at the time, watching Into the Dalek, I was sure it meant something.

false,Ardal,yorkshire,Yorkshire,"It wasn't taken away, it was handed back. GNER had been run by Sea Containers for quite some time and made good money, when the franchise came up for renewal they were outbid by National Express (NX) (the bosses of GNER at the time said the bid was fucking stupid and there was no way the company could afford to pay back to government the amount NX said they would pay if they got the franchise) They actually almost doubled the payment Sea Containers put in their bid, unheard of in the industry and should have been a red flag to the rail regulator BUT.....the promise of big money won them the bid, they soon realised they simply couldn't get even close to the figure they'd promised, after several high level meetings they handed the franchise back and the only option was to returning it to the regulator for running until a new round of bidding could be arranged. Then the west coast bidding debacle put a stop to all franchise bidding until recently. I'm out of the industry now so don't know much detail anymore, but I was right in the thick of this fucking mess when Sea Containers lost the franchise, virtually everyone in the industry was disappointed with that decision, Sea Containers were good employers and provided a really classy flagship service in GNER, NX really fucked that up, got rid of loads of staff, did away with the excellent dining that GNER had, did away with a lot of cheaper fares and staff perks, held back wages. I guess they did run it a little cheaper, but it really looked that way too. 
I used to commute daily on the East Coast from Leeds to London and loved it until NX fucked it up, then it was back to shitty food, staff shortages, delays and cancellations..  

I should add that if nobody told the public who owned the franchise it really wouldn't be an issue at all, I worked in the industry for 20 years at all levels, when a new bidder wins a franchise the only noticeable change comes in staff uniforms, train logos and paint colour. 95% of the staff remain unchanged, a new MD comes in, makes a few changes at board level (not many) and everyone carries on exactly as we did under BR, the drivers drive (but get 4x the salary under private companies) conductors conduct (higher salary) shunters shunt etc, Companies save money by closing a few booking offices and putting machines in instead (3 shift system means each booking office has shitloads of staff) they make tickets that say ""Virgin Trains Only"" nowadays so ALL revenue from those tickets goes to Virgin (other companies do this too) previously all operators on a route shared the ticket revenue via a complex calculation of passenger numbers. Companies that didn't offer 'First Class' sections on their trains (Northern Trains for example) didn't get a share of that market. That's why you suddenly saw shitty little first class sections on shitty little trains (ATN, TPE, Northern), nobody used those shitty little sections but it didn't matter because now they could claim their bit of the first class pool of money, so the 'big boys' started with 'Company Name' tickets only so they could once again keep the majority of their revenue.  This move really fucked it for customers who could previously board any train as they now can only board certain trains, this is a nightmare for all staff as they have to explain why the guy who just paid a fortune for a ticket can't ride with them and the poor fucking tourists...sheeesh.

At work I might talk to a few kids who are practising Christians. They'll do youth work, or go to clubs and things like that. It's not weird but it's definitely in the minority. Within friends I don't know any practising Christians. 

At university, where the sample size was much larger, there was a Christian society and I did live with a guy who was much more American in his religious beliefs. He took the Bible as a literal document and had complete unwaivering belief. 

I think British society has a lot more non practising Christians than practising, both young and old. People's nans might go to Church but I don't know anyone under 60 who goes to Church. Like you said, we're more reserved about it, so maybe they do and don't mention it. But no one in my friendship group is a practising Christian. However, they all still marry in Churches and have their children Christened. Whether this is because of faith or tradition, I don't know.

Interestingly, other religions see a much higher rate of practice. My Sikh friends regularly go to the place of worship and so do lots of Muslims and other faiths. It just seems Christianity is no longer as important here. A lot believe in God but don't go out of their way to be part of the faith.

Usually an hour a week, in the national curriculum, where they learn about the culture and beliefs of major religions.

&gt; Any specific reasoning for the repetition of phrase?

The papers are great at headlines, but for a number of years they've become increasingly unreliable at reporting the content their headlines mention. When they do get the content right they often suffer from cherry-picking data to suit the paper's underlying narrative (i.e. confirmation bias). So I've come to the conclusion that if you want to make your mind up on something based on the actual facts you're often better off finding the source, reading the source, and making your own mind up.

As an analogy: I want to open a current account. I can choose between getting the information from the papers, or reading each bank's current-account literature. Which do I choose? Well I could go with the Telegraph because my dad read that and I sort-of trust it, y'know. And reading the current-account literature takes a bit more effort. So I choose what the Telegraph recommends, but this time they called it wrong. And now I have a current account that's crap. Oh no! Who to blame? The Telegraph! It led me astray. Maybe I should try the Guardian? ...

That's exactly the kind of situation you have when people make decisions about which MP to elect, and - by extension - how to run the country, based on what they read in the papers. But running a country based on what people you don't even know have told you in passing is no way to go about things. You have a mind. Use it.

So ... that's a bit ranty. Sorry about that.

As a counterbalance ... I don't believe that anyone has time to read all the back-story for everything the papers print every day. I know I don't. And what kind of conversation could you possibly have with someone who always wants to go check the facts first? They'd be a complete arsehole:

A: ""Good morning""  
B: ""Just checking ... yes, yes it is""  
A: ""Do fuck off you tedious prick""  

So it's not like I'm saying ""You should never express an uninformed opinion"" ... that's just nonsense. There's a time for pub-talk and passing the time of day and there's a time for talking about things seriously. When it is time for taking things seriously though I can think of better sources of information than John Q Reporter.  
  
So - as far as this issue goes - here are the questions that immediately spring to my mind:  
Immigration might have increased since last year, but what about the long-term trend (it's still down on 2005, for example)?  
How long a period of time do we want to consider when looking at trends?  
How does selecting a period of time affect our conclusions?  
Why do we even care if the figure goes up or down (i.e. why might immigration be a bad or good thing)?  
What figures are there on the effects immigration might have on the economy?  
What figures are there on the effects immigration might have on society?  
What's the methodology behind those figures?  
Who commissioned the figures?  
Do they have a interest in proving a point?  
Does that mean their figures are bogus, or is their methodology sound?  

Think Ben Goldacre's Bad Science column, only applied to political issues, and you'll get where I'm coming from.

(I'm going to assume you mean Parliament, not the government, because all executive decisions are subject to judicial review)

Yes, there's no legal barrier to Parliament passing primary legislation to seize property, not just of the Crown Estate but also of any other citizen or corporation. Parliament could pass a law tomorrow saying ""everything belongs to us"" and it would be legal.

However, there are political barriers to such an enactment. Property rights are possibly the most fundamental rights in our society. For Parliament to pass an Act targeting a single individual and seizing their property would be highly tyrannical. 

(There is a debate over who owns the Crown Estate, but two things are legally clear: 1. whoever owns it, it's not the government, so they would be seizing *someone's* property, even if that someone is a corporation 2. the *revenues* are property of the monarch, as demonstrated by each monarch signing the revenues over.)

And of course, the abolition of the monarchy would instigate massive constitutional change. It's highly debatable whether supremacy of Parliament would survive such an upheaval. A legislature with zero limits on its power is highly unusual and really only exists because of historical circumstance. If we came to the point where we were rewriting huge parts of the UK constitution, I doubt this is something that would be retained.

I was always told that you can tell a lot about a bike by the physical appearance of the bike itself. That isn't always the case of course, but if the bike has scratches on its fairings, the exhaust has almost rusted all the way through and the tires are bald, what does that tell you about the person that owned it? In my mind, that would tell me that they didn't look after that bike. That would then tell me that there is more likely to be more things mechanically wrong with it, as well as superficially.

Now I understand that is a hell of an assumption to make. But if I am spending my money on a bike I personally would not settle for a beaten up one. I suppose it all depends on your personal preference. Mine would be that as I use my bike very day come rain or shine, that I want it to be as reliable and as cared for as possible.

Then then subtract the amount of tax you have already paid; whatever is left is what you owe that month.

Doing it this way means that there is no ""projecting"" of your income required, it's self-adjusting for big bonuses, changes in salary etc. and (assuming all your pay is through one employer) is always right at the end of the year. Your tax is also constant if your pay is constant.

e.g. if you got a big bonus in April that pushed you into the 40% tax bracket, over the following months looking at it cumulatively some of the money that was taxed at 40% would ""fall back"" into the 20% bracket and your tax would be reduced accordingly. If you had a month of zero pay while still on payroll, you would get a tax refund (because you'd have one extra month worth of tax-free allowance and thresholds, but no more income).

You can have a negative tax code, it's a K code. A K tax code of K1000 means ""tax this person based on £10,000 *more* than their actual income"".

Back in the day, a family could get by on a single income (usually the father), and the mother had time to prepare and think about meals. Now, it's a lot harder because the house prices to income ratio is much higher. It's very hard to save for a house and support a wife + children.

For the last 7 years, I did this. My wife looked after the children and, when I got home at 6:30pm, she would have dinner ready for all of us.

My wife has, just this week, gone back to work. That means we both have to get up an hour earlier to take the kids to a child minder, and we all get home at about 6:30pm to *start* preparing and cooking dinner. We're all tired at this point with less motivation to think and prepare a proper meal.

By the time I get home, I have a strong temptation to just buy fast food and be done with it. I can imagine that people who don't think or know as much about food and nutrition might take the easy approach and give in to temptation.

As much as possible we're going to try to stick to our usual dinner menu where we only ""treat"" ourselves every couple of weeks to a fish'n'chip dinner or get pizzas from a supermarket (because they're tastier than the rubbish from the local shops).

That being said, I think that there were a lot of wasted opportunities with her as a character, and a lot of the frustration stems from the fact that both Coleman and Capaldi are fantastic actors, but the writing and stories have been all over the place in terms of quality. Mummy on the Orient Express and Flatline were fantastic, but then we also had to plod through Kill the Moon and Forest of London. 

Moreover, I get that the Companion is largely supposed to be a stand-in for the audience, however, the show can not lose its balance like it did, where *Doctor Who* ceases being about the Doctor.

Also, it wouldn't kill for them to dedicate some review writers to ensure that the plots are self-consistent and make sense given general knowledge. I mean, Moon is an egg, I can go with that, *Doctor Who* has had some pretty weird premises before. But why would something growing in it alter the gravity? Its mass is unchanged. And how would a newborn spacebaby immediately lay a new egg the same mass as the one it just hatched from, which would necessitate that the new egg also have a mass greater than the thing that just laid it.

I genuinely overheard someone ask their friend what they were doing for black Friday yesterday, I couldn't believe my ears. It's not New Year's Eve, you don't 'do' something on Friday the 28th of November. At best, you might pop online and buy a new television that you don't need and return it next week.

She is the last link to the Royal Family of old, of the wartime generation, pre-information age.

Back in the 13/1400s, way before the ""new world"" became general knowledge, the only main form of Christianity in the British Isles was Catholicism. The English Kings had embarked on the crusades on the Pope's orders, and most people believed and worshipped as Catholics. 

Then, in the 1500s, Henry VIII came along and decided he wanted a divorce, and the Pope wouldn't grant one. So Henry split the Church of England off from the Catholic Church and made himself head. His Daughter Mary and her Husband Philip gave the Church of England back to the Pope when she became Queen Mary I. Mary was devoutly Catholic, and allegedly had over 280 religious dissenters burned at the stake. On the accession of her half-sister, Queen Elizabeth I, 5 years after Mary took the throne (she apparently died of influenza), Elizabeth once again removed the Church of England from the Church of Rome, and appointed herself head.

So by this point the English were all theoretically followers of the Church of England, because Henry and Elizabeth's reforms told them they were. Masses switched to being given in English, but not much more else changed at the time.

This is where the stories start to diverge - by this point Sir Francis Drake had sailed up the west coast of the USA, and Columbus had landed in South America and Florida, so I'm going to jump forwards to the American section of this story starting in the 1600s.

In the 1600s the first settlers came to the USA from England - the Spanish had already explored areas of the the South-west USA at this point via what is now Mexico. The Spanish were devoutly Catholic, as evidenced by some of the names they gave to places - ""La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de Asís"" (The Royal Town of the Holy Faith of St. Francis of Assisi)  was the first name for Santa Fe, NM, and ""El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles"" (the Town of Our Lady Queen of the Angels) was the name of Los Angeles when the Spanish founded the site.

The English settlers, on the other hand, were a mix of branches of Christianity, the most well known of which were the Puritans - they had emigrated to The Netherlands a few years prior as they were being restricted in practising their beliefs in England, however the sudden resurgence of Catholicism in The Netherlands made them return to England, and then move out to America, where they were too far away for anyone to stop them practising their own beliefs. 

It should be noted at this point however that the Puritans did not come over to establish a ""just and righteous society"" - they came over to make a Puritan country - as Gore Vidal put it, ""The puritans did not leave Britain to go to America so as to be free from persecution. They went to America so they can be free to persecute.""

By the 1770s when America was drafting it's declaration of Independence, the country had recognised the need to separate the church from the state.

However, America continued to be a Christian nation, although there were many denominations and variants - thanks to the freedom of religion laws in the USA if you didn't like what your local church was preaching you could go down the road, found a new one and preach your own version.

Back in England, laws were very restrictive on what religion you could practice - these tended to alternate with the faith of the monarch, so a Catholic king would crack down on Protestants or Puritans, and a Protestant monarch would make Catholicism illegal.

This all came to a head (har har) when King Charles I lost his - he was executed after disagreeing with Parliament over a number of years, and trying to exercise absolute power, which he no longer held. The fact that Charles was married to a Catholic princess from Spain and was a devout Catholic himself sowed mistrust between him and non-Catholic citizen groups. 

So the English Civil War started, and after some fighting Charles I was captured and beheaded for treason. Oliver Cromwell, a devout puritan, became the leader of the Parliament, and gradually took control until he was named Lord Protector, exercising more powers than the King ever had. 

Upon Cromwell's death, a power vacuum was created, and after a brief but unsuccessful attempt by his son to rule in his place, the parliament decided to call for Charles II to return to Britain (he had been exiled in Europe), and the monarchy was restored.

Charles II learned the lessons of his father's death, and he advocated for religious tolerance. However, Parliament wanted to re-establish the Church of England and Protestantism, and Charles had to agree.

When Charles II died, he was succeeded by his brother James II, who was Catholic. This fact, coupled with the fact that his son and heir was baptised Catholic, led to the Glorious Revolution, where James II was deposed in favour of William of Orange, James' Protestant Son-in-Law, from The Netherlands. 

William and his wife Mary were invited by some of the top people to take over the country, but they had to sign a document handing over all their powers, and thus our constitutional monarchy was born.

The rules of the constitutional monarchy state that any Monarch will be head of the Church of England, and bans them being Catholics. Our Prime Ministers are also banned from being openly Catholic (for some reason) and since then until religious tolerance was introduced no one really trusted Catholics being in any seat of power.",0,1417170352,null,0,false,0,cmf76pi,t3_2nlzzg,t1_cmf76pi,t3_2nlzzg,null,1425804170,1,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,1

People that, let's be honest, many who are shouting the loudest about these recent cases couldn't actually care less about. They are children who need money, care, support, serious investment from social services and other agencies which are all seeing cuts and challenges.

The police dismiss concerns, feel they are not worth investigating, or even blame them for continuing to hang around with these men and see it as ""consensual"". Social services are overwhelmed, the police do not back them up and some want to just ignore it as they don't want a scandal. Some even are worried about creating a fuss as the perpetrators are mainly from certain communities.

Home cooking is definitely lacking so a lot of children are being fed foods full of fats and sugars - I've seen a lot of small children being fed an adult serving from Greggs for MacDonalds and it baffles me how ignorant the parents can be.

Also there is a lot of body acceptance going around which I think is wonderful. The only problem is people think it means it's okay to be unhealthy and misunderstand what 'curvy' actually means. Curvy does not mean you can be as big as you want without accepting the consequences.
I would consider myself curvy because even when I was at my lowest weight, I still had large thighs that would rub together and I had a bigger bum than most despite not having much fat on my upper body - yet you get seriously overweight people saying they are just curvy even though the proportions of where their fat is going would say otherwise. Not to mention eating loads of junk food still makes you unhealthy, that goes for fat people and thinner people.

I don't know about other people's experiences but attitudes have definitely changed over time IMO. When I was a child my parents would only ever let us get one or two bottles of fizzy drink over the 6 week holidays and never any other time. We were only allowed small amounts of sweets every so often and we generally had home cooked food 4-7 days of the week. Whereas when I got to 18+ they would buy me fizzy drinks any time I asked and became much more lax on the whole eating healthy thing (that was until my dad had a heart attack).

We go to a lot of weddings these days too (we've hit that time in our lives around 30 when everyone gets married) It's a surprise how many people have church weddings, how many of those church weddings have a feature on the faith of the couple and what it means to them.

The thing over in the UK is Christians don't tend to talk about their faith openly. Not because people are ashamed, but because it's not such a big deal. Its a part of their lives but it doesn't dominate them.

The Church of England is of course very British. Its not a particularly evangelical institution. It's there if you want it but we're not going to force it down your throat kind of attitude. Also in the UK we don't experience a fierce divide between atheists and theists meaning theological debates do not arise as frequently as they do in other countries like the states. The church does not interfere with politics in the same way either (that's not to say it doesn't happen occasionally though). People are generally tolerant and understanding of each other's beliefs meaning debates at dinner parties etc revolve around other things.

There are some churches I've attended with huge amounts of young people, others churches you won't find a person under 50 in the congregation.
I believe there is a church 'franchise' called 'The Vineyard'.

Team sports are already the most accessible sports in the country. They are rammed down your throat at school (precisely because they are cheap to do en-masse. A single football will occupy 22 pupils for an hour, an athletics track requires the caretaker to paint some lines). Every town has local level football, hockey, athletics and rugby clubs. You know what? Some of us just don't enjoy them.

What we need is for schools to be funded and given the resource to promote individual sports. You can spend thousands fitting out a sports hall with [traditional gym equipment](https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7143/6538233239_0db6ac6777_z.jpg) - bars, ropes, etc, but often (some portion of) that money would be just as well spent on a climbing wall.

Don't get me wrong, I well appreciate that a lot of the individual sports are heavy on capital equipment - there's a reason kayaking, fencing, rowing, archery, etc tends to be the preserve of public schools with small class sizes, larger budgets and management that take sport seriously and give staff the time and resource to do that (though that said, Scout Groups manage - usually by pooling capital equipment over a district, which school areas could easily do - maintaining central reserves of capital equipment, or sharing gear - one school shares their archery kit in return for another school's fencing kit).

For many, the reason they ""don't do sports"" is that they have been fed the *lie* that ""sports"" involve running around a track or running around a pitch for 80-90 minutes chasing a ball (of whatever shape). The fundamental problem with those sports is they exclude those who are not naturally athletic or reasonably quick runners. They were forced to do something they weren't good at, didn't enjoy them, and consequently drop them like a hot potato at the first opportunity.

There are plenty of other countries where women work that have not seen equivalent rises in obesity. I'm an expat who lives in one of them btw. The difference is the cultural value placed on exercise (I live in the Netherlands, where more women work, but everybody bikes for example) and cultural appreciation of good food and healthy food (Britain identifies meat and sugar and fat as good to a far greater extent that other European nations - we also have a culture that encourages us to eat everything on our increasingly huge plates, instead of stopping when we're full). 

There really is no correlation between women's participation in the workforce and the rise of obesity.

false,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"4-2-3-1 was the right solution for Benitez when he was trying to work out how to fit Alonso, Mascherano and a younger Gerrard into a midfield. (Nice problem to have!).

If we're to persist in playing with a single striker, we do need to get every midfielder who is remotely capable of scoring a goal close to him, so 4-2-3-1 seems like a decent shot as long as we don't lose the midfield battle..

The key is that the 2 have to be able to totally fucking boss that midfield, even if they're outnumbered. You need a combination that has it all: both have to be able to tackle and pass. Rafa had that, in two players one of whom was an absolute monster in defence and one who was one of the best passers in the game, but both players could do both jobs when needed.

Can we find that combination in our squad? On paper you would think that Lucas and Gerrard would have a similar dynamic to Mascherano and Alonso, but time after time that has failed. Lucas and Allen might work better: Lucas is awesome in the air and would make up for Allen's deficiencies in that area, and Allen is the best we have for retaining the ball in a tight spot and turning with it.

The other key to 4-2-3-1 is that the full-backs become defenders to a greater extent than we have been used to recently. That means benching Johnson. The role should be ideal for Manquillo, and being forced to focus on defending would be good for Moreno's development too.

Finally there's the 3 to worry about. It's Coutinho, Sterling and one other. Whilst trying to play Markovic into form seems like the obvious solution, I'm getting rather close to picking a team without either Gerrard or Hendo at this point, and that just seems wrong.

Neither is a strong enough goal threat to play in the 3 of a conventional 4-2-3-1, so the answer is to be a bit clever and skew the formation somewhat.

                    Goalkeeper

      Manquillo    CB    CB
                                       Moreno

                           Allen

    Henderson
                 Coutinho      Sterling


                    Striker


The left-back pushes forward more than the right back, meaning the centre-backs adjust their position slightly (exactly as Henchoz and Hyppia used to with Riise and Carra at full back). Henderson is on the right basically doing his usual thing but getting into the box more than he does in a diamond. Because Moreno is supplying some attacking width on the left, whichever of Coutinho and Sterling is nominally wider at a given time has the option of getting in to support the striker more than if he was in a strict 4-2-3-1.

Weaknesses of this formation: no genuine attacking width (but we've had that problem since Mark Walters was at his best) and Allen will have to play a lot of long passes and be spot on with them otherwise the whole thing breaks down.",0,1417173124,null,0,false,0,cmf7n4g,t3_2nmad3,t1_cmf7n4g,t3_2nmad3,null,1425803886,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

The analogy with a club bouncer on Friday night is flawed. A more accurate analogy would be comparing it to outside a nightclub on New Years or Xmas, a big uncommon but regular event. Every year on Xmas and New Year there is a higher police presence outside night clubs, and the nightclubs tend to have more staff on at a time then they normally would, just as most of these supermarkets probably had more security than normal and expected a higher police presence.

It seems like you're suggesting businesses should be forced to pay through the nose for policing (something we all already pay for through taxes) a problem that is not their fault. They put on the sales, but it's the minority of idiots and their reaction to these sales that's the issue, not the sales themselves.

It's unclear to me if this is about static IPs for all homes or just more thorough logging of address usage.

But I don't think static IPs are a good idea for end users, I wonder how many free IPv4 addresses there are and how many ISPs rely on never having every address assigned at once. I'd also be concerned about malicious server admins and port scanning. I run a few services and use dynamic DNS to access them remotely. Scans are pretty frequent but any problems and I reset. With a fixed IP I'd probably get more persistent attempts at brute forcing.

If everyone in the country had a fixed IP (or if the ISPs could quickly determine who had what when) you can bet ISPs would gradually start to sell that data after a minor T&amp;C change that you ignored. Before you know it you're getting spam mail from insurers because gocompare sold them your IP and your ISP sold them your address. Then that questionable porn site you really like but are ashamed to tell your cat about gets hacked and someone posts a list of visiting IPs.

I have a lot of experience with lawyers, particularly litigators, and they never advise litigation except in very cut and dry cases.

Hell, in this particular case you are relying on ""he said, she said"" tactics which would barely make the threshold of ""on the balance of probablities"". A first year law student could tell you that this is unlikely to work.  
  
Furthermore, lawyers are masters of covering their own backs (in fact ethically you are required to give proper advice which in practice will rarely be ""litigate""). Any barrister worth their salt will always advise you to reconsider a tort action like this: the risk is high, the reward rarely worth it.  
  
Finally, this is an exceptionally high profile case. Bad advice could ruin the reputation of those involved. As such most lawyers will move to make sure that if things get nasty, which they could, they have the evidence that they highlighted the risks and gave strong warnings.

Both Leamington and Kenilworth are prettier to look at than Coventry - Leamington being livelier and better for a younger set while Kenilworth would be more suited to families with children. 
Both have good bus connections to the uni. 
Leamington has better shopping and more eating options.
Both have loads of nice green areas walkable to from the town if you like to get out into the countryside.


Coventry arguably has slightly better sports facilities but the uni has great facilities on campus so you don't need to choose where you live based on the local facilities.
If you stay late drinking at the uni a taxi ride home to Earlsdon will be a lot cheaper than a taxi to Leamington.
Coventry city centre is a graveyard of boarded up shops and soulless concrete monstrosities, just being around that city centre is depressing for me, although perhaps that's because I grew up there.
Cov has good rail connections into Brum if you want to go back home to visit or to go out.
I'm pretty sure Cov rental is cheaper than Leamington.

One thing that always strikes me about Lamela is he isn't afraid to do the dirty work.

But out of our entire team his pressing is right up there which is really awesome to see. Even in the last few minutes of games he'll be pressing and running down players which is really encouraging.

That's entirely my point. They can reasonably assume there will be trouble, as it's happened before. They therefore *didn't* mitigate responsibly. I have no problem with them calling the police if they weren't expecting it, but they *were*.

&gt;But I feel you're also implying that if we let them call the police for an event that happens once a year, then they're just going to sack all their security staff and let the police handle their security all the time.

Nope, never said that, nor implied it.

Hiring enough security to prevent what they could assume would happen wouldn't affect your ability to have a good time. It would affect their profits, maybe, but that's my point. My tax money is providing them with free security, so that they don't have to pay for it.

&gt;___Shite-hawk___ (also spelled ___shitehawk___) or ___shit-hawk___ or ___shitty hawk___  is a [slang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang) name applied to various birds of prey that exhibit scavenging behaviour, originally and primarily the [Black Kite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Kite), although the term has also been applied to other birds such as the [Herring Gull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Herring_Gull). It is also a slang derogatory term for an unpleasant person.

What other people? And what do you mean by ""fix""?

&gt; Brit kids are more likely to assimilate to a migrant then a migrant assimilating to be British.

Do you mean children of immigrants are more likely not to assimilate if their parents didn't? Cause that's hardly a revelation.

See my other comment on how cumulative tax is worked out so how this self-corrects for variations in pay.

The only time any kind of prediction is required is where there are multiple simultaneous employers, then HMRC need to give a tax code to each employer that will result in the tax taken by each being close to right at the end of the year and to do that they need a good estimate of annual earnings for each.

At least that's how it works now, HMRC are moving towards Real Time Information where, ultimately, tax will be calculated by HMRC rather than employers. So each month your employer will tell HMRC your gross pay and HMRC will tell the employer how much tax to deduct.

a lot depends on the ""architecture"" of your site. if you're just serving static content (ie every user gets exactly the same content) like a typical brochure site, scaling is easy - you pretty much can just add more servers.

with something like e-commerce, the database generally becomes a bottleneck for various reasons. you can scale databases to huge traffic volumes but it's nothing like as easy and requires *significant* planning and investment.

if you're only getting huge traffic spikes occasionally you might be better off pragmatically putting something like this queuing system in place - at least, to give you breathing room to figure out how you're going to manage scaling your site for the future.

that said, I'm surprised Currys (and their ilk) haven't long since got to the point where they needed to scale their databases so maybe this is a marketing gimmick. If so, it really sucks ...

Granted, I find doing lengths boring, and you don't want to put people off from going to open swim sessions for fun because they think it's all about doing lengths for an hour, but they could certainly be doing more to promote it as both a competitive sport and a fun fitness activity rather than just teaching kids *how* to swim and then killing those lessons.

Or, having taught kids to swim, leading it into Water Polo and other pool-based activities. A team sport that doesn't rely on how fast you can run and levels the playing field somewhat.

This is one of the great myths that gets trotted out every time someone dares to question the monarchy

Do you really suppose that any real number of people come to the UK with 'the monarchy' as their deciding factor? No, when they happen to visit they like to see their big houses and historic buildings.

&gt;The Tower of London, Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace the most popular Royal destinations.

We could make much more from these properties if they were fully open to the public and tourists with tour guides and what's more we can save £300 million a year by getting rid of them.

But even if everything I just said was wrong, and they are slightly profitable...is it worth whoring ourselves out and living in a society based on birth privilege from the top down? There was a study in the last few days that we are more likely to inherit our father's social status than his height - clearly social mobility is a myth at the moment. http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-014-9219-y/fulltext.html

Going back to the Queen's death though...it should be interesting. When Charles takes over and starts spouting off, most people will see what a cancer the monarchy is on democratic society. We will truly be a laughing stock of the world that day. But maybe then we can elect a proper head of state that will keep ministers in check, instead of thinking they have a free pass to do what they like - and it will only cost 1% of what  a monarchy costs us.

false,evi1eye,eng-kent,Dartford,"&gt; So the party leader who went to a comprehensive school ranks in the right-wing media universe as ""Mr Weirdo"". Meanwhile, the assorted public-school plutocrats and aristocrats who lead other parties – the Farages, Osbornes, Johnsons and Camerons – are granted a free pass as relatively ordinary blokes. Alumni of Eton, St Paul's or Dulwich, heirs to wallpaper fortunes, fortune-hunting City dealers, television PR chieftains, celebrity editors – if you stand far enough to the right, then any privileged eccentricity of background and career will win a seal of warm approval from the arbiters of normal blokeishness. 

&gt; Much of the hate campaign evidently stems from straightforward, above-board political bias. But beyond the business-as-usual media vilification that in Britain almost always tries to delegitimise a Labour leader prior to a general election, there is something almost demented about the scale and fury of Miliband-bashing.

&gt; (...) Just a couple of weeks ago, the Tory militant Toby Young compiled yet another routine litany of Miliband oddities. The bacon sandwich, however, ranked for Young as ""the moment Ed's weirdness went mainstream… Again, this was an instance of him trying to appear normal and getting it wrong. Only in this case, not slightly wrong, but horribly wrong."" Why ""horribly wrong"", Mr Young? In what sort of political universe can two seconds of allegedly clumsy pork-eating become the definitive proof of unfitness for high office?

&gt; He's not one of us. He doesn't quite belong. He's nerdy, geeky; he tries to act like a regular guy but fails miserably. All standard innuendos. Meanwhile, when Nigel Farage devoured his own bacon sandwich during the Heywood and Middleton by-election, the people's verdict (according to the Mail) ""was that he did much better than Ed Miliband"". Of course he did. Nige is authentically one of us.

&gt; We don't need to attribute malice or bigotry to the vast bulk of Miliband's pursuers (although if you take a peek into the noxious basement of online anti-Semitism, you will find almost nothing else). In his case, some rusty but lethal implements have rolled out of the toolbox of stereotypes. They may still do an effective job, even if most people can no longer read the maker's mark. Anti-Semitic tropes that brand, mock, isolate and belittle the victim as an alien impostor can slip under the radar and avoid detection while still inflicting harm. ""Weird"" Ed – gauche, weedy, bookish, a stranger to the saloon bar and the porky doorstopper alike – may suffer from the taint of the Jewish outsider without (most of) his foes ever having to think in those terms.

Football is accessible, and that's why it is endemic, even though a lot of people actually don't really enjoy playing it.

A lot of people find ball games overly artificial, and running laps round a track to be utterly tedious. Football bores me to tears. Don't enjoy watching it, don't enjoy playing it. Had to fight tooth and nail not to do it at school.

Lots of people buy their team's strip and watch the game,s but they don't actually play the sport. Remarkably few people actually *play* football!


My beef with it is that school sports divide kids very clearly into ""sporty"" and ""non-sporty"", when really the divide is ""athletic"" and ""non-athletic"". 

Football, hockey, track running - these are all clearly biased to the naturally athletic individuals. People who can run and sprint off a line quickly. Dependant on when and how puberty hits, you can get massive divides between kids of the same age.

Sending the message to a person that they're ""not sporty"" because they're not athletic is fundamentally wrong.

I took no joy in being lined up on a track and being beaten every time. Sure, perhaps if I had an hour with a sprint coach they might improve my technique, but my physiology simply isn't geared towards sprinting. I *never* won a sprint race against my naturally athletic school mates. We had the same sports lessons, ate the same lunches - people are just *built differently*.

So what did I do? Dropped it at the first opportunity.

Surely having a few options on the table in the hope that there will be something I *can* get good at is more conducive to long term sporting participation?

It's 2014. Liverpool, led by their narcissistic but benevolent King Brendao, have returned to Europe once again after several years in exile and excommunication following the in-fighting of Lord Hicks and Lord Gillett, and the fateful episode of the Bard Carroll. 

Liverpool have, however, lost their talismanic nobleman and musketeer, Prince Suarez of Salto in the long summer to acute Latinitis, a raging syndrome that consumed Europe for several years, taking with it Germans, Colombians and even Welshmen. 

Having seen Liverpool conquer Europe before in his lifetime, King Brendao, recognised the value to his people of being in Europe. However, he needed, in the absence of Prince Suarez, to build an army capable of mounting an assault on foreign lands while dealing with unrest at home. 

He acquired a number of talented and experienced shipbuilders from Southampton to aid in the traversal of dangerous foreign waters, as well as an explosive Serbian Gusar, a feckless Italian mercenary and a strong Prussian-Ottoman Jannissary. It was thought at that the time that sufficient reinforcements had been recruited to make the people forget the passing of Prince Suarez, and to support the longer term ambitions of the King and his foreign benefactor, Johannes Henrik of the New World. 

These were strange times for Liverpool. Once masters of, now visitors to a land they are told they belong to. Would King Brendao have the guile and ruthlessness required to tackle unrest in London and Manchester whilst forging a new home for his people in Europe? Or would an arrow to eye fell him and rout his armies on a cold, windswept Tuesday night in Stoke? Only time would tell.

~**Plot Overview**~

It is November 2014. Liverpool have struggled in their various campaigns so far, particularly after the loss of Sir Sturridge to a near-fatal blow to the ankle while crusading for Pope Hodgson VII. The Italian Viscontes Balotelli and Borini, and Lord Richard Lambert have been unable to make significant breakthroughs at home and abroad in his absence, with low morale plaguing the men and fears spreading that Liverpool were ""doing a Spurs,"" referencing the desperate and failed attempt of the Northern London tribes to form a coherent argument against the prevailing idea that they are actually a crock of shite without the magick-wielding Paladin Garrick Bale.

They have lost three battles in Europe after making initial headway against the unheralded but feisty Bulgar kingdom Ludogorets. Expectations are low when Ludogorets leader Despot Dermendzhiev further taunts King Brendao's army by suggesting that Liverpool will start fighting better soon. A return battle is hastily arranged in the Bulgar capital of Sofia.

The sword-fighting begins on a cool Wednesday night. King Brendao's sends an army comprised of four central artillery regiments, a pair of forward regiments (one originally a flanking force) and an unusual formation for the army's relative strengths. It is a defensive but experienced force, meant to turn the battlefield into a cauldron for the opposing army.

Alas, King Brendao's men suffer an early setback, when Ludogorets scores the first hit. The vanguard forces of Count Mignolet's Garde Civique fumble an early assault, and the Bulgars gain the upper hand. 

Liverpool respond quickly, with Lord Lambert capitalising on poor defending from Duke Cosmin Moti to bring things back to a stalemate. The defence and attack of Liverpool are tidier than before and the new position of Sir Gerrard of Crossfieldpass seems to have improved the team's coherence. Master Raheem is liberated of some of his tracking duties by Lords Leiva, Allen and Henderson, allowing him more freedom to press higher and shine in his general play. 

However, communication and consistency are still lacking in the forces, leading to disarray at times, a familiar sight at home and on the continent this campaign. Then Ludogorets' rear forces are cut down by their own swords on a high press counterattack by Lord Lambert, Master Raheem and Lord Henderson, bringing back fond memories to the Liverpudlians of past campaigns. Principe Coutinho, in the primal haze of battle, then touches himself behind a curtain, an act that does not go unnoticed.

Despite this promising return, Liverpool retain a defensive stance, and as the attritional battle drags on, reinforcements are withheld by the unmoved King Brendao. This leads to exhaustion amongst the troops and ongoing confusion amongst battle observers. Sir Gerrard, clearly broken, walks the battlefield in a trance, but no help is to come.

Terziev, himself poisoned by a tainted chalice, then stabs Moreno, Johnson, and Mignolet through with a sword in the dying minutes of battle, and seeing the carnage before them a stalemate is declared. After revealing to King Brendao that it was indeed Pope Hodgson who had directly felled Sir Sturridge, Terziev convulses and dies from the poison.

It becomes known all around that the next battle in Liverpool's European campaign is to be their last if they do not take revenge and comprehensively defeat the Swiss forces of Basel. With King Brendao praising his side's efforts in Sofia, to the confusion of many, the home cities fear the worst, that their benevolent and tactically astute ruler is actually a nutjob.

Curtains. Gentle sobbing can be heard through them. A shadowy projection of Principe Coutinho appears, half covered by the curtain - he continues to touch himself.

~**Character List**~

* Mignolet - Made a calamitous error to allow Ludogorets to gain an early upper hand; threw some punches later on, missed them  
* Johnson - Largely anonymous during battle  
* Skrtel - Fought reasonably well  
* Toure - Fought reasonably well, maintained command of the defence    
* Manquillo - Caught out a few times by pace but managed well   
* Leiva - Coordinate poorly with Allen but protected defence well   
* Allen - Performed duties reasonably, coordinated poorly with Lucas at times   
* Henderson - Tireless effort, but faded in second half of battle. Great strike to give Liverpool advantage  
* Raheem - Improved, lots of running and incision. Looked more fearless than recently  
* Gerrard - New position was an improvement but faded badly in second half, needs to be rested/dropped at some point. Should have been subbed.  
* Lambert - Admirable work rate and pushed through to end of battle. Strike was deserved. Needed a sub.

You typically have at least 3 sports sessions a week - we had Monday afternoon - 3.30-5.30, Wednesday afternoon 1-4 and Saturday afternoon 1-4.

Because the entire teaching staff are involved you have enough staff to run multiple sports. If your PE department has 2 staff, they can only reasonably run 1 or 2 activities at any given time.

By contrast at independent school, you could have an option between Football, Hockey, Pool Sports (Swim/Water Polo) and Cross-Country. Or in the summer it's Cricket/Netball/Athletics/Pool/Cross Country/Tennis.

One teacher had a love of climbing so he got his instructor's certificate and convinced the head to give him £1000 for gear - which is enough for a couple of harnesses, ropes, helmets and metalwork. He'd throw 15 of us into a minibus on Wednesday and take us either to a local climbing wall (in winter) or into the Peak District in summer.

Aside from ropes (which need replacing annually or when damaged), most of the other kit had a lifespan of at least 5-6 years. £200/yr plus some diesel is a cheap sport to run.

A school down the road took kids sailing at a local water sports centre if they wanted, as they had a sailing-mad teacher. I imagine if we'd had a squad-mad teacher they might have negotiated some space on a Wednesday afternoon with the local squash club and taken kids there if they wanted,

false,jamiroq,cnty-wales,Wales,"I blame P.E in schools for deterring a lot of people from exercise.

P.E for some reason, has no goal or something to strive towards. From what I remember it was like: ""Right, everybody run 1500m because.""

The problem with that is, fat kids don't enjoy it because they aren't good at it, and then feel embarrassed when their fitter class mates blitzed it.

For me, P.E in schools NEED to cater to individual goals and not just make  all kids run around/play sports.

If you had different sets, you could group kids by athletic ability, e.g:

Highest set - most athletic kids who need pushing or guidance in the sport they are representing schools in. Individuals have profiles that show where they need improvement.

Middle - Those who are not totally unfit, but need to figure out what they want to do, individual goals should be discussed to determine how best to spend the lesson.

Low - Unfit/Overweight individuals who's main priorities are going to be to lose weight and get fit, this could start off with low intensity and ramp up over the year with their progress monitored.

For example:

Young Kenny is overweight by 10kg, he wants to lose that, so the teacher sits him down and explains how hes going to do it with a nutritional plan and all so that he can show his parents what changes he needs to make to his diet.

Its a lot of work, and certainly more than a P.E teacher would be used to, but I think the long term benefits would be good.",0,1417183138,null,0,false,0,cmf9jv2,t3_2nmsm3,t1_cmf9jv2,t1_cmf719u,null,1425802995,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt; Constructive dismissal

&gt;Constructive dismissal is when you’re forced to leave your job against your will because of your employer’s conduct.

&gt;The reasons you leave your job must be serious, for example, they:

    don’t pay you or suddenly demote you for no reason
    force you to accept unreasonable changes to how you work - eg tell you to work night shifts when your contract is only for day work
    let other employees harass or bully you

&gt;Your employer’s breach of contract may be one serious incident or a series of incidents that are serious when taken together.

&gt;You should try and sort any issues out by speaking to your employer to solve the dispute.

&gt;If you do have a case for constructive dismissal, you should leave your job immediately - your employer may argue that, by staying, you accepted the conduct or treatment.

You can bring a case for less than £10,000 through small claims court, unless
things have changed recently. That would be the cheapest option. If the guy is not paying you that's a clear case of constructive dismissal. CAB will be able to help you.

Just because the police were called, it doesn't mean they didn't put in reasonable measures to mitigate things. With that size of a mob outside, the only responsible thing to do if you've got all available staff on the job is to call the police.

&gt; Nope, never said that nor implied it.

I'm sorry I inferred that then, here's 2 of the quotes that lead me to infer that:

&gt; And if they do this every year, then how is that different from a nightclub not hiring bouncers, and just expecting the police to hang out on their door every Friday night?

&gt; Are you quite happy to pay extra taxes for more police because companies won't pay for their own security? Should bars and nightclubs stop having bouncers, because they can just call the police?

-----

&gt; Hiring enough security to prevent what they could assume would happen wouldn't affect your ability to have a good time. It would affect their profits, maybe, but that's my point. My tax money is providing them with free security, so that they don't have to pay for it.

Do you think if they'd had 100 more security guards, people wouldn't have started fights, or shoved and trampled? I disagree, I think no amount of security would be enough there. And when those security guards had apprehended those behaving criminally, what do you think would have happened? The police would have been called. What would you prefer? Your tax money wasted by police filling out paperwork for crime, because they were reactive, and instead turned up after the crime, or would you rather your money spent on police out there proactively being present and preventing crime from happening in the first place?

The big change is how long governments  (and their ministers last). The fairly high level of control show by the civil service was mostly a result of ministers not lasting long enough to do much. By comparison since the start of the 80s we've had decade+ long governments resulting in ministers having time to learn how their department works and thus how to control it.

At the same time politicians in general have been becoming much more professional. Back in the 70s early 80s the reality is that your average MP would be only so so at their job and might well have significant commitments outside parliment. The conservatives had their gentlemen landowners and labour had their union officials who the unions wanted to kick upstairs. Upshot is that their ministerial talent pool was pretty damn shallow. These days goverments have more viable options when appointing their ministers.

Media management has gone from being a useful skill to something everyone had better be good at.

**Subs:** Steer, Clark, Richardson, Gardner, N'Zogbia, Kozak, Robinson

I feel like the more **Okore** and **Grealish** play, the better they will get, too. Both have high ceilings, IMO. So I had to include them both. Tekkers and Delph aside, they're the two players that excite me the most in terms of the club's future both long and short term.

**Notes:**    
Was tempted to chuck Robinson in on the right instead of Bacuna, and drop Bacuna in midfield instead of Sanchez maybe... but I'm not sure that's a good place to use him. I can see Bacuna ***maybe*** working okay on the right of the three, because he's great at getting forward... but his defensive duties get neglected, so it's not really viable IMO. I think he's effective on the wing though, and with Tekkers in the middle, you want to use width.

I also considered Gardner in midfield (with Delph and Westy), but I'm not sure where he's at in terms of recapturing his promising early career form tbh. Both him and Robinson made the bench though, because I think they're both good prospects.

N'Zogbia I'm torn on. Every now and then he does something that makes me think he'll finally start to show his ability, but then he disappoints. Bench for me, mainly because while I don't think he offers enough to edge out Bacuna and Grealish, I don't feel like Cole is an upgrade on him. Also don't think we have any other viable winger/attacking midfielder to put in anyway.

**Didn't quite make the cut:**    
Feels weird leaving Gabby and Weimann out, but as much as I like the guys and think they still offer a lot... they don't really ""excite"" me, you know?

I also highly question the 2 million figure that gets dick-slapped over this Reddit on every EU related thread.

However, I'm not convinced that story necessarily paints an accurate picture of ""Brits"" in the EU. Infact, I wonder how many of these so called ""Brits"" are actually 1st generation migrants from outside the EU who got citizenship in the UK only to move on into Europe. Ultimately, it stands to reason that if you were prepared to up roots to the UK for work, you're probably prepared to follow that work across Europe if need be. 

I have seen a few anecdotal examples of this; for example I worked with a Rwandan guy who was technically a UK citizen by way of asylum, who spoke fluent french (as many Rwandans do) and emigrated to France for work when his job here came to an end. So technically, he falls into that ""2 million"" number - and while he was a really great guy, the bottom line is contrary to that little bit of paper that says otherwise, he isn't really British in the truest sense.

This claim is untrue and irrelevant. Even VisitBritain, our national tourist agency, can't find any evidence for it.

Chester Zoo, Stonehenge and the Roman Baths are all more successful tourist attractions than Windsor Castle, which is the only occupied royal residence to attract visitors in large numbers. If Windsor Castle was included in the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (ALVA) list of top attractions it would come in at number 24.

Research shows that tourists come here for our world class museums, beautiful scenery, fantastic shopping and captivating history - not because they might catch a glimpse of Prince Andrew. In a republic, royal properties such as Buckingham Palace would be open all year round, so visitors that do want to explore our royal heritage would have even more opportunity to do so.

But, even if the claim were true, do we really want the whims of visiting tourists to determine what kind of political system we have?

Alcohol would be no different. People who drink (i.e. most of us) would, on the whole, not support a ban. There might be a few that did for whatever reason, but it seems unlikely that very many people would want to ban something they enjoy doing themselves.

&gt;

&gt;In [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom) [slang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang) an __anorak__ /ˈænəræk/ is a person who has a very strong interest, perhaps obsessive, in niche subjects. This interest may be unacknowledged or not understood by the general public. The term is sometimes used synonymously with [geek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek) or [nerd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerd), or the Japanese term [otaku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku), albeit referring to different niches.

In terms of trying to enforce a private contractual ""debt"" - they still need to prove to a court that a contract was in place and agreed with the driver. Even if they do succeed in proving this to a judge, under English law you can only claim for actual *loss* due to breach of the contract, as opposed to being able to levy a fine or penalty (which is illegal for a private company to do).

So loss when it comes to a free parking space = £free, loss when it comes to a £5.00 parking space = £5.00.

You can ignore private tickets and there is slim chance they will try to recover from you (small claims court minimum fee is ~£30 - which is unprofitable when the maximum payout you will get is £5 + £30)...

However if you wanted to be absolutely sure and confident of your legal standing, you can also write to the parking company and make a settlement offer for the price of the ticket to compensate for breach of contract (if you believe you agreed to one).

I'd love to have a team of academy talent which we could be proud of.  They'd play their hearts out and they'd be ""our team."" However, because we are a club with high ambitions, we can't depend on all academy talent. Yes we can bring up the few who are more talented and be overwhelmed with pride that ""one of our own"" is doing great things for the club. These are the people like Kane, Mason, Bentaleb, King, etc. However, there would more than likely be others who weren't as talented and we wouldn't be able to wait on them for years to see what they could do. And that is why we have to buy great players or established talents like Eriksen, Hugo, Vertoghen, etc.

Some quotes  

Zac Goldsmith: ""It is impossible to believe there wasn't a cover up."" Acknowledges many pockets of conspiracy all over the country but does not believe there is an over-arching grand cover-up. His constituency contains the Elm Guest House.  

Tim Loughton: Has spent time with survivors. Said these accusations can't be dismissed as conspiracy theories. He produced a letter from a member of the public defending Jimmy Savile to show how belief in there being a conspiracy ""the other way"" can affect this investigation. Defended the appointment of Butler-Sloss and Woolf as heads of CSA inquiry.  

John Hemming: ""One lesson we should learn is how easy things are to conceal by the state.""  
""The word independent is massively abused in the child protection system.""  
""We know children were sent [to Jersey] from London to be sexually abused.""  
He recounted a story of a woman being banned from travel by the UK government when she said she was on her way to investigate possible abuse at the Haut de la Garenne care home. He said senior officers have been instructing junior officers to break the law by concealing evidence. In response he suggested an amnesty for junior officers to report such issues without being tried for breaking the law. He also called for better statistics on children going missing from care. Said there was greater care taken to track money going missing than children.

 Halloween is a perfect example. Ours is a pale echo of the American one (where they really go to town). Then, six days later, we have Guy Fawke's Night - which used to be really good - but now it's a bit crap, because so many people have already had a crappy, British, Halloween. Years ago, Guy Fawke's was effing brilliant. Everyone had a bonfire, and a ""Guy"", and sausage rolls and soup and jacket tatties. And all the fireworks got ignited the same night. It wasn't as glitzy as American Halloween but it was ours.

Another one is ""high school prom"". For fuck's sake: another import that we don't do as well as our cousins across the water.

The REALLY annoying thing is that almost every American ""holiday"" is nothing more than a crude money-grab, and they're trying their best to drag us into the net. They must be so pissed off that they can't foist ""Thanksgiving"" on us.

Black Friday is just the latest. I heard today on R4 that it was Amazon who introduced it, followed by ASDA (ie:Walmart). The interesting thing is that the ""bargains"" aren't really bargains at all. It's just another way of fleecing stupid people.

I completely agree for a tourer 10k would be more in order as an average mileage, it still isn't what I'd buy. My point was though that when looking to buy without mechanical knowledge (what this thread is about) I would want to be looking at lower milage machines. That's all.

Also I really didn't get from your comment you saying only go for bikes up to 20k. You said your preference is that but nowhere did you exclude high milage bikes from what you were saying. For example the bike OP linked to is 10 years old with 37k on it. A reasonable extension of your advise would be it's fine with 100K on it as it's 10 years old.

So there seems little consensus at all for that to occur.

I suggest people just be more open in expressing how they want this subreddit to develop and we can all try and take that on board.

I for one will make efforts to post interesting non political content where I find it to try and keep the place balanced.

But if people want to debate and discuss, throw ideas around, allow their opinions to be scrutinised (surely one of the good things about this website) then its often going to be political posts that draw that out.

In summary:

- downvote posts you don't like
- make an effort to address over-politicisation of the subreddit (if you feel that way) by posting non-political content
- share feedback if you think the subreddit is going in the wrong direction in order that others can be informed by that
- politely ask posters to change their behaviour if you think that's required
- if someone is a persistent menace, even after above polite request, ask the moderators for support

Does that seem a reasonable set of responses to the issues people are identifying?

And you know how to develop youngsters, don't you? We only see what happens on the pitch. If they're good enough in training they will get a chance. Teixeira is hardly the best example. He had very bad back injury which took quite a big chunk of his development and at that age he should get regular playing time. Other examples brought out here have been 16-17 year-olds. They don't look as good as Sterling at that age. I don't blame them - Sterling developed early. Sterling got a chance because we didn't have better options then and we had extremely light squad. It's all changed now and it's not so easy to get a chance now.

This is exactly my point which you seem to be missing.  Rodgers has made it even harder for them, not easier.  He's no advocate of our youth players at all and he sure as hell hasn't given them a chance.

Shaw, Clyne, Chambers, Ward-Prowse, etc.  They got a chance because Soton are good at promoting youth players and actually giving them a chance.  Stones at Everton, Kane at Spurs- both got a chance and have taken them.  For us, it's Sterling, but he only got his through bad luck with injuries (fair enough as that happens and it's part of what the Academy should be used for) and, given all the vaunted and completely unneeded 'depth' Rodgers has bought, even injuries at this point wouldn't get a youth in the side since we now have so many first team players already.",0,1417192952,null,0,false,0,cmfcz6a,t3_2no4qg,t1_cmfcz6a,t1_cmfcrr9,null,1425801397,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

I don't know enough to come down either side, but the report basically says further research is necessary before a consensus. That fracking can be safe and reliable if performed with care (not without risk), but there has been a lack of research in terms of alternatives.

The title implies the dangers are well known, understood and comparable.

Thalidomide went from first trials to market in less than a decade. The UK already has a much longer industrial history with fracking. I'm not saying it's enough, but the guardian has taken a comparison of the general situation (lack of long-term research) and implied a comparison of risk, which is not in the report.

They chose from a list thalidomide and asbestos, two things perceived as inherently bad and scary by most people. I think the leaded petrol (which is an issue less well known by many) is a much more interesting comparison as we are still only now discovering the consequences.

It seems to me that that a title like this will lead people to decide fracking == thalidomide, and go around telling people fracking causes phocomelia, which is not known.

 [**Flynn effect**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn%20effect): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __Flynn effect__ is the substantial and long-sustained increase in both fluid and crystallized intelligence test scores measured in many parts of the world from roughly 1930 to the present day. When [intelligence quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient) (IQ) tests are initially [standardized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score#Standardizing_in_mathematical_statistics) using a [sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_(statistics\)) of test-takers, by convention the average of the test results is set to 100 and their [standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) is set to 15 or 16 IQ points. When IQ tests are revised, they are again standardized using a new sample of test-takers, usually born more recently than the first. Again, the average result is set to 100. However, when the new test subjects take the older tests, in almost every case their average scores are significantly above 100.

Yes, it works exactly as you said. The ball bearing goes into the head of the screw (bolt, actually) so that you can't fit an allen key in to undo it. If you want to go the whole hog, fit onto the two bolts on the rear of the stem, the four bolts on the faceplate of the stem, and the headset cap screw.  

To get past it, the thief would need both solvent and time. Or if you soldered it, he would need to bring a soldering iron with a battery - fat chance! Alternatively, you could fill the entire bolt head with solder alone. Though this could potentially take more time to remove than a soldered ball bearing.

As a result, their tax take as a percentage of GDP is around the same as ours: Their high tax rate offset by the fact that wealth flight is a thing.

&gt; unneeded 'depth'

How can you say it's unneeded? It was a miracle that we didn't crumble to the injuries last year. We barely had key players out all year and if we did have some out - they weren't out very long and the injuries didn't pile up.

Rodgers can't give youth a chance if there isn't nobody to give a chance to. We got a proper academy setup not even a decade ago. Before Rafa changed it up it was a mess. We can't expect players to magically appear when we're still waiting on the first bunch of kids from renovated academy. 

Kane is 21 and should be getting a chance. If he's not getting any gametime at that age, he should leave immidiately. To his benefit Spurs' strikers are rubbish. Stones is good enough and he isn't their academy product - they bought him early 2013.

You're also forgetting Flanagan. He got a chance and held his place. 

It's rare that players under 20 get a chance regularly in Premier League, they have to be exceptional talents. ",0,1417194812,null,0,false,0,cmfdqwm,t3_2no4qg,t1_cmfdqwm,t1_cmfcz6a,null,1425801038,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

&gt; What bus should i get from Liverpool One to Anfield?

If you're after a more direct mode of transport. Stand outside of Lime St station, so you're stood with your back to the main entrance, and you're looking at St George's Hall/St John's. The main street that leads down the slope (Not Queen's Sq bus station) down towards Victoria St (Google it) if you walk down there there will be some arl fella in a Liverpool jacket asking if you want a taxi there. It cost £1.70 I think, and once the taxi has 4 people in, it goes off to the ground and another replaces it. You can meet some interesting people on the way too and have a little chat.

As for getting back? WALK! Come out the ground and walk down Walton Breck Rd, towards the Oakfield. Turn right down St Domingo Grove and through the Academy onto Heyworth St. You'll be on Everton Brow, and if you go into the park, you'll get a boss view of the city.

&gt;Are there people outside the ground that sell scarves and other matchday items?

Yes. LOADS!

&gt;Is there anything that is frowned upon doing in the stands (apart from the obvious)?

Depends what you define as ""the obvious"" :D

Also make sure you pop into the HJC shop opposite the ground and buy a badge or something. Ask for some stickers too and take them away and put them all around where you live. :)

He is under no obligation to put up with that sort of attitude. Got to say he's a better man than me, I would have lost my temper and got out of the car like the gentleman wants. Good on the parking attendant for doing the right thing. 

If someone is being a cunt, I'm all for calling them a cunt. But the parking officer wasn't being a cunt at all.

Why do people seem to think parking tickets are some sort of personal attack when they get them? They aren't. You parked illegally, deal with it. If I parked illegally, I would. I don't want a fine so I don't park illegally - not exactly a science is it.

I'm also completely against giving people leeway as some sort of blanket rule. There is clear line, If we start giving people 10 minutes leeway then people will start moaning that they were 'only 10 minutes' late over the leeway limit. If you have a genuine reason outside of your control for being late then obviously some sort of discretion should be employed, but the parking officer can't prove it either way so stop moaning to him and take it to appeal.

This is probably a key issue.  The way personal fitness is taught at school is really an attempt at a generalist one size fits all approach and for most people it fails.   If they could reform the way the PE system works and give it a larger focus as well as more strongly encouraging people to pursue activities outside school that would keep them fit the benefits would be pretty interesting to see. We put massive focus on academic achievement but studies into fitness have shown that it yields major results not only in health (physical and mental) but in cognitive function.  I'd be really interested if they did a long term cost analysis of the benefits of improving PE against costs to the NHS in terms of treating illnesses like depression, obesity, dementia etc.  Not that being fit is a cure all but it would certainly help.

&gt;Study

Has that study controlled for how people drinking any sodas in the first place have a diet that's worse? No, it hasn't. Diet soda consumption causing weight gain by itself would be a violation of conservation of energy.

&gt;One of the main ingredients of diet soda is high fructose corn syrup – and lots of it.

*Grabs bottle of pepsi max*

No, HFCS isn't on this ingredient list. In fact, the entire fucking point of diet soda is that it doesn't contain HFCS or Sugar. It uses Aspartame, a substance with negligible calories, as it's sweetener. I challenge you to find one diet soda that even contains any HFCS at all, let alone it being a 'main ingredient'.

&gt;That’s a whole lot of bad from only one of the harmful ingredients in diet soda.

The worst ingredient in diet soda is Phosphoric acid, because it will deal some level of damage to your teeth as all acidic foods do. I doubt they are talking about the Phosphoric acid though.

&gt; Diet soda is full of aspartame which is an artificial sweetener that never satisfies the appetite, and actually inhibits the brain’s ability to receive the “feeling full” signal…

Conjecture at best. Making shit up at worst. Nobody has actually proposed a mechanism or demonstrated a causal relationship here.

&gt;In addition, diet soda significantly increases your blood pressure levels, and the body can’t break down all of the sugar, so it gets stored as fat…

Diet soda doesn't contain sugar.

&gt;There are minimal natural ingredients in soda.

So what?

&gt;Drinking diet soda will inevitably make you gain weight

Absolute statements like this are stupid. I once lost 3kg over a period of time in which I was drinking diet soda, which instantly disproves this.

&gt;Drink only water – and tons of it.

You would die from water intoxication far before you managed to drink tons of it.

The reason I am suggesting the encouragement of sugary soda -&gt; diet soda is because people are stubborn and are not going to entirely change their diet by drinking something they don't like.",0,1417195965,null,0,1417196878,0,cmfe8yy,t3_2nmsm3,t1_cmfe8yy,t1_cmfe7hd,null,1425800804,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

That's good, but you also need Income Protection insurance. A bad back will stop you working, but your CIC won't pay out for that.

&gt;On the mortgage v pension - would overpaying the mortgage at the expense of the pension save more than paying into the pension now and paying the mortgage over the longer term?

It's impossible to say. It depends on what your target income is in retirement, your preferred retirement age, your attitude to investment risk and the performance of the markets. We can do some basic maths, though.

**Scenario 1:**

Currently, your mortgage is £300pm x 12 x 21 = £75,600 repaid on a loan of £58,000. If you increase your repayments to £800pm, the loan should be repaid in 6.5 years (see http://www.mortgagecalculator.org). You will then have £800pm net (£1,000 gross) to put towards your pension.

**Scenario 2:**

If you committed £550 towards your mortgage now, it would be repaid in around 10 years. That would leave you £250pm net (£312.50 gross) to put towards a pension plan now, increasing to £800pm in 10 years.

Total contributions to your pension in scenario 1 are £294,000.

- £800 net = £1,000 gross x 12 x 24.5 years (age 40.5 to age 65) = £294,000

Total contributions to your pension in scenario 2 are £289,500.

- £250 net = £312.50 gross x 12 x 10 years = £37,500
- £800 net = £1,000 gross x 12 x 21 years = £252,000

As you can see, payments to the pension appear almost equal. You are missing out on some market growth by delaying your pension, but I still think it's worth clearing the mortgage first. You would also have saved interest on your mortgage bill, which may well be greater than the market growth lost.

Please check the maths - this is not my strong point and I may have missed something bleedin' obvious!

So far, nothing new: the lone white male is the norm for UK child sex offences. Second, however, there are Asian offenders, many of whom are of Pakistani origin. They seem much more likely to offend in groups, lending their abuse a curiously social dimension. In our research, which focuses on large offending groups, we analysed police data from five major on-street grooming investigations. Of the 52 suspects charged, **83% were Asian Pakistani, 11% Asian other** and 6% white British. These are shocking statistics and the over-representation of Asian offenders within this dataset certainly merits attention. There may be important factors that explain why the bigger networks have been largely Asian. Nonetheless, it is crucial to remember that these cases do not paint a full picture of this crime. If on-street grooming continues to be reduced to the big Asian networks alone, a whole host of other offenders will get overlooked.

We did see extreme examples of obesity, but it was less prevalent because we lacked the socioeconomic drivers of obesity.

false,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"I think a cool idea would be to find episodes that have some similarity or some sort of connection/reference to each other.

So for the Daleks show:

* The Daleks and Dalek as they are both the first time we see them in Classic Who and New Who. They don't really have much in common but it is a good place to start because they both set the tone for how the Daleks will appear in the future.

* The Dalek Invasion of Earth and The Stolen Earth/Journey's End. In both tales the Daleks use the Earth in/as some kind of engine. In fact the Tenth Doctor even makes a fleeting reference to the events of The Dalek Invasion of Earth. (alternate Classic Who would be Genesis of the Daleks which would show how Sarah Jane met Davros).

* If willing to listen to one of the audio reconstructions listen to The Power of the Daleks and watch Victory of the Daleks. They both concern the Daleks pretending to be the servants of man. Interestingly in Power it was the Daleks who proved who the Doctor was to his companions (this being the Second Doctors first outing) while in Victory the Doctor proved who the Daleks were to the cloning machine (this being the Daleks' return after their destruction at the hands of Meta Ten).

* Also listen to The Evil of the Daleks and and watch Daleks in Manhattan/Evolution of the Daleks. They both concern the Daleks trying to use humanity to make themselves more powerful since humans seem to be one of the few non-Time Lord races that have effectively fought off the Daleks in certain situations.

* Genesis of the Daleks and Bad Wolf/The Parting of the Ways. Both have the Doctor having the chance to definitively destroy the Daleks but ultimately deciding against destroying them. In Genesis it is because all of the good that comes in the future of people banding together to fight the Daleks instead of fighting amongst themselves and in Parting it is the Doctor deciding not to sacrifice the Earth along with the Daleks because of its bright future.

* Revelation of the Daleks and Asylum of the Daleks. Both concern the Daleks turning humans into Dalek mutants. They also both concern human duplicates.

* Remembrance of the Daleks and Army of Ghosts/Doomsday. Both concern the Daleks trying to use Time Lord technology to return to power. In Remembrance they try to use the Hand of Omega to gain the power of Time Travel on the level of the Time Lords and in Doomsday they use the Genesis Ark (a Dalek prison created by the Time Lords) to exit the Void and return to the universe following the Time War.

For the Master show:

* The Claws of Axos/Frontiers in Space are a good one two punch to watch before The Sound of Drums/The Last of the Time Lords since the Tenth Doctor specifically references these adventures as the Master is dying in his arms.

* The Deadly Assassin and The End of Time. Both concern a dying/dead Master finding a way to extend his life. And if people think that the Master has only been insane in New Who, Assassin is a good way to show that insanity has always been there in his character just not the forefront. Both episodes also concern the Time Lords. In Assassin they unknowingly face ultimate destruction at the hands of the Master and in The End of Time they face their ultimate salvation at the hands of the Master.

* The Keeper of Traken/Logopolis and Dark Water/Death in Heaven. These both concern mysteries the Doctor must solve where the Master is at the heart of the mystery controlling things behind the scenes. In Logopolis the Master tries to take over the universe. In Death in Heaven the Master tries to get the Doctor to do the same.

For the Cybermen:

* The Tenth Planet and Rise of the Cybermen/Age of Steel are the introductions to the two kinds of Cybermen (Mondas and Cybus) so they are a good place to start

* The Tomb of the Cybermen and Closing Time as both introduce the Cybermats and concern the Cyber-Controller.

* The Invasion and Dark Water/Death in Heaven for the many obvious parallels such as St. Paul's Cathedral, busting up from the sewers/graves, UNIT and a Stewart, etc.

* Silver Nemesis and The Next Doctor both dealing with Cybermen and Earth's past.

The Autons are easy since you can just watch Spearhead from Space or Terror of the Autons with Rose.

For the Great Intelligence watch The Web of Fear with The Snowmen. In The Snowmen we actually find out that it was the Eleventh Doctor Who gave GI the idea of attacking the London Underground in The Web of Fear. (alternatively you can listen to the Classic Who episode The Abominable Snowmen or watch the New Who episode The Name of the Doctor)

For the Ice Warriors watch The Ice Warriors and Cold War. They both concern a lone Ice Warrior who is thawed from the ice by humans and the incidences threaten war between the two species.

For the Silurians, Doctor Who and the Silurians and The Hungry Earth/Cold Blood as they both concern the Doctor trying to broker peace between humanity and the Silurians after humanity accidentally awakens a group of Silurians.

For the Zygons Terror of the Zygons and The Day of the Doctor.

For Sontarans, The Sontaran Experiment and The Sontaran Strategem/The Poison Sky as they both concern the Sontarans planning to invade/invading Earth.",0,1417197197,null,0,false,0,cmfes1o,t3_2no49x,t1_cmfes1o,t3_2no49x,null,1425800556,6,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,6

Ok, citation please. I would be interested to see that.

I can't really decide between these two line-ups. I know they are a bit unconventional. 


First off, there is absloutely nothing about Ron Vlaar's horrendous clearances that I find a bit too exciting. I didn't include Okore in my first line-up because I don't feel that I've seen enough from him to grant him a starting place. However if going for a 5-man defence I'd rather play the unknown than Senderos or Vlaar. 

I don't really like Benteke either, he does a lot of stupid shit, getting a lot of unnecessary cards. So if playing with a lone striker I prefer Kozak, but I feel Weimann and Benteke links up too good to ignore him if we are going with two strikers. 

As for left back, Bennett has gotten a lot of stick, but he had some decent games there last season, unlike the other options for that slot. Stevens also did a decent job the few games he got to play a couple of seasons ago. Unfortunately he was signed by McLeish, so he never had a chance under Lambert. 

I remember Herd's first start against Wolverhampton. Absolutely brilliant at right back, and I think he can get back to that given some games. ",0,1417198720,null,0,false,0,cmffgbe,t3_2nlgfm,t1_cmffgbe,t3_2nlgfm,null,1425800171,1,false,avfc,t5_2s569,1

false,Sasakura,eu,European Union,"&gt; For an internal an external drive to fail at the same time is just astronomical odds.

Like in a house fire? :P

I'm mostly going on this report from Google: http://research.google.com/archive/disk_failures.pdf from 2007 but aside from SSDs is still relevant. 

&gt;Power Cycles.The power cycles indicator counts the number  of  times  a  drive  is  powered  up  and  down.   Ina server-class deployment, in which drives are powered continuously,  we  do  not  expect  to  reach  high  enough power cycle counts to see any effects on failure rates.Our results find that for drives aged up to two years, this is true, there is no significant correlation between failures and high power cycles count. But for drives 3 years and  older,  higher  power  cycle  counts  can  increase  the absolute failure rate by over 2%. 

&gt;The figure shows that failures do not increase when the average temperature in-creases. In fact, there is a clear trend showing that lower temperatures  are  associated  with  higher  failure  rates.

Not super strong quotes in my favour certainly; but I would still be happy saying always on drives are less likely to fail than cycled ones.  
There is some mention of vibration but they don't have data so make no comment.  Given modern head parking speeds and fall sensors I wouldn't expect that to cause failure but you're more likely to drop a standalone drive than an internal just by virtue of it being possible.",0,1417198898,null,0,false,0,cmffj5y,t3_2nko53,t1_cmffj5y,t1_cmff6sz,null,1425800134,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

The UK (and the wider world) suffers a long, deep economic depression, and in the UK a new nationalist party gains notable popularity. Through somewhat nefarious means, they end up winning a general election (well, it's a hung parliament so they don't have an absolute majority).

The sitting monarch then uses their royal prerogative and refuses to let the nationalists form a government, so off they go and form their own.

Not really, the law around private contracts has not changed. You can freely ignore the appeals procress and jump straight to dealing with it as any other private civilian contract.

&gt; I would say it's more of a trade-off than being totally against the private parking firms.

It forces them to use a specific procedure, ensure they use appropriate signage, requires correct language used in communication... it's more work for them than previously - whereas the POFA gives more protection to the RK by making the requirements!

&gt; And there's a process that you might be expected (by some disinterested judge) to have engaged in if they end up filing a claim.

I've already explained the only process that matters as at law - it's a contract dispute and the onus is on the private parking firm to prove that you have a contract!

&gt; It's a fact that some PP firms file MCOL claims already.

Which ones? I've never heard of it and in the many tickets I've ignored from PP firms, I have never had a moneyclaim come through.

&gt; Your payout is certainly not limited to their loss of the actual parking fee.

By stating this, you appear to show that you have no idea of what you're talking about and neither have performed any basic research into the matter.

&gt; but that doesn't mean it won't cost you a significant amount of time and money to deal with it.

It doesn't, trust me.

&gt; Also I disagree that it's a discrete evaluation for them. OK, they might lose money on individual cases, fair enough. But if word gets around that they'll cause you hassle for not paying up, then that has a desirable chilling effect.

Again, you have no idea of what you're talking about when it comes to contract law or consumer protection.

If a company decides to harrass you for a ""debt"" owed - then they are legally obliged to observe a number of acts of parliament designed to prevent harrassment and unfair contract terms - this is well documented online and I assume you are familiar enough with Google to educate yourself.

In short, if a company does not intend to prove the debt by taking you to court, and decides to ""cause you hassle"" they will find themselves committing an unlawful act and risk losing any reputation with trade bodies, any licenses they hold and/or being fined by industry regulators as well as sued by the harrassee for emotional distress.

Now please, do not embarrass yourself further.

Every time she says things like that I am completely blown away by the impact exposure to almost exclusively American media has had on her.
