I honestly prefer a DoF who oversees transfers with the input of the manager as ideal. The problem with a ""commitee"" is that you can easily undermine the manager. What's the point of signing players that dont fit a system and will never be used. You end up just pissing away money for no reason.  If a manager flat out rejects a signing, he shouldn't be signed. It's as simple as that. As an example, we signed players like Aspas and Alberto for 12-14m and not even used them. Whats the point?

In regards to his transfer dealings, that's up in the air now, but I do think he struggles with using substitutes.  Even last year, you know when Suarez almost one the league while Brendan was doing nothing, he struggled with utilizing subs in an effective way.

I think his first season was about getting familiar with his squad, which caused him to play a more cautious possession style.  Last season, he knew what they could do.  They couldn't defend, but they could attack at an alarming rate.  However, with the loss of Suarez, he knew that we would struggle with goals.  I think he felt Lovren would help with this.  He was fooled, and this is his and the scouting department's fault, because Lovren had the privilege of having two good CDMs in front of him.  Because of all this, he has resorted to the more cautious possession play again.  However, this causes the team to soak up a lot of pressure, which it seems they aren't good at.

I am torn on the idea of sacking him.

false,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"I think this is a bit of a simplistic way of looking at it. Imagine you're FSG - you buy a club you carefully want to turn into a successful CL-qualifying and title-challenging entity. You try Comolli, you try Dalglish - it doesn't work. 

So you hire a young exciting manager with little proven track record but very appealing philosophy. Of course, you're a successful business man and you're not stupid - you're not going to give this man who has never managed a squad of such size and resources free reign. You'd prefer for him to work under the tutelage of an experienced international manager, whom you'd appoint as Director of Football. Hopefully, together they'd craft a formidable side and the young manager could learn much quicker from the older one. Makes sense, no? 

But your young manager flat our refuses this. 'Okay', you say to yourself, 'at least he's showing some balls... we like that'. So you appoint him anyway and allow him to bring *his* players on board. Enter Fabio Borini and Joe Allen. That summer, also enter Assaidi and Nuri Sahin. And an attempt to bring Clint Dempsey in exchange for Jordan Henderson. 

How did that go? 

Of all the ones above, only Joe Allen seemingly remains, and even that hardly in the 'Welsh Xavi' role he meant to make his own. And so you decide to ensure you spend your money wisely in the future - you establish a 'transfer committee' that includes your young manager. After all - you want him to be involved - he's the man playing these players after all. But it also includes scouts and other senior staff - people who have greater experience than Rodgers in assessing players' potential but also others who have plentiful experience in negotiating transfers. On paper, such a team makes perfect sense... 

We all know how that turned out. My point is, what FSG did makes sense on paper - it is unfortunate that it didn't work. Now, Captain Hindsight is a marvellous fellow and I'm sure Rodgers can come up with a list of players he would've signed, if it only wasn't for that pesky transfer committee meddling with things. I am sure the transfer committee too could come up with a list of great players they would've signed, had Rodgers not vetoed them - you do have to remember that we haven't heard anything from any of them (aside from Rodgers). Furthermore, do we honestly believe that they would sign players Rodgers specifically vetoed? 

In my mind, what probably happened was this: Rodgers wanted Costa, they tried to sign him, Costa refused. So they signed other strikers (Lambert, Balotelli), whom Rodgers probably accepted, even though they weren't first choice. And now there seems to be a bit of revisionism going on. 

Last year, when things were going great, everyone was happy and all was well at LFC. This year, when things are not working out, there is a lot of blame going around. Strangely, most of this blame seems to come from one source: manager blames individual mistakes, manager blames refereeing errors, manager blames injuries, manager blames transfer committee. I don't like this. 

What I liked about Rodgers is that he seemed reasonably humble whilst confident and was eager to learn. What we are seeing this season is none of that - we see stubbornness and an inability to spot one's own mistakes. 

Call me crazy, but I think if Rodgers was in charge of transfers, we'd be in the exact same position we are now, if not worse. 

FSG didn't install the transfer committee to sabotage managers. They installed it to make sure that one man's folly does not hurt the club. In that, I think they are right. Many successful clubs operate this way and if Rodgers is suddenly unwilling to work under the agreed terms and conditions (remember, he agreed to all of this), then perhaps he ought to look elsewhere. No one man is bigger than this club.

Don't get me wrong I see how a DoF could help consolidate the process but I just don't think it's that easy, especially considering our problems on the pitch. There's probably a reason FSG and Rodgers both agreed on a committee, especially considering the disaster that was Comoli, but that aside are we really in that much trouble because we have a few more people in the decision process? 

And as for our ""recruiting method"", it feels pretty reactionary to go through assessing who and how we sign players just because things haven't been going well for less than half a season; it's like thinking about your life when you aren't in a good mood, of course you'll come away from it thinking you're fucked.

&gt; It still seems a little strange to me that someone could have a huge amount of wealth in the country, which is generating a huge amount of income of others' work, and pay nothing in tax if they shift it out of the country to spend elsewhere. 

This is going a little off-topic from LVT; but I'll do my best to respond.

The thing to appreciate is that wealth doesn't really leave the country.  Let's say I'm a software developer who has sold his company for £100 million and is going to go to Australia with all my wealth to live a life of luxury.

What do I do?  Well, while it might need a bit of financial mucking about to do it with such a huge amount, I'd effectively be exchanging my GBP for AUD.  ""HA!"" you cry, ""there goes some wealth"".  But that is to miss that an exchange involves two parties.  In order that I can sell GBP, there has to be someone to buy GBP.  GBP are only useful for spending in the UK, so that wealth hasn't left the country.

The only observable effect of wealth leaving the country would be if there were not a willing buyer during the exchange and you were forced to offer your GBP at a lower price -- i.e. GBP would be worth less.  However, you'd have to be pretty insane to purposely lose money by dumping all your wealth on an exchange in one go.  You'd do it gradually so it made a small splash.

Balotelli was a gamble, but we only paid £16m for him. I just don't understand why people think that all these players magically became shit the moment they put our kit on.

Hire a defensive coach and start playing with Lucas each week and watch Lovren become the player he was last season. Actually play Sakho when he is healthy, because he is already class.

See if Moreno can improve defensively with a defensive coach. If not, convert him to left wing and bring in another LB in January.

Play Can for fucks sake. Same with Markovic.

Lallana was amazing for Southampton, he just magically sucks now? I highly doubt that.

If Mignolet can't improve his decisions and distribution, then sign someone else and use Migs in cups and as a very strong backup.

Balotelli may end up a dud, but he really needs to be given a run of matches with Studge next to him up top before we can determine that, and even if he is a dud, we will still recoup a good portion of the fee we paid in my opinion when we sell.

&gt;

&gt;__Frobisher__ is a [fictional character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_character) who appeared in the *[Doctor Who Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who_Magazine)* comic strip based on the long-running British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) series *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)* in the 1980s. He was a [companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_(Doctor_Who\)) of the [Sixth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Doctor) and [Seventh Doctors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Doctor).

&gt;Frobisher is a __Whifferdill__, one of a [shape-changing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapeshifting) [extraterrestrial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life) race. What is assumed to be his natural form, as seen in his first comic strip appearance, is [humanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid), pale yellow in color, three to four feet in height, with a round, featureless head, and wearing spectacles. However, he preferred to spend his free time in the form of a [penguin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin).

&gt;When he first appeared in *The Shape Shifter* (DWM #88-#89), written by [Steve Parkhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Parkhouse) with art by [John Ridgway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ridgway_(comic_artist\)), Frobisher was a [private investigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_investigator) calling himself ""Avan Tarklu"" (a play on the phrase ""Haven't a clue""). He came across [the Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)) when an enemy of the Time Lord, Josiah Dogbolter, had placed a bounty on the Doctor in an effort to acquire his secrets and his TARDIS. After infiltrating the [TARDIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TARDIS), instead of turning the Doctor in for the money, Tarklu decided that he liked the [Time Lord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord) and helped him against Dogbolter; both split the advance bounty Tarklu had been given from Dogbolter. He then joined the Doctor on his journeys. He assumed the name of Frobisher because he felt that it sounded British and thought that the Doctor would like that.

The problem with a different backup, is you then need a third system to vote on which system is erroneous. So you actually need to develop three different ways to do the same task (and in fairness, that's exactly how [modern autopilots work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot#Computer_system_details). The space shuttle also had 5 flight computers. 4 identical and one developed totally independently, and only capable of running the most essential, basic flight systems so in the case of the primary software failing, the 5th computer shouldn't encounter the same error).

The other thing is that the mainframe *was* actually recovered. They have 8 minutes to bring the mainframe back up before they have to go into contingency. Unfortunately, although they got it back, there was then a *separate* problem with the network link to various data sources (which the flight data system requires), which meant it wasn't functional for 15 minutes, by which time they had failed into contingency protocols of stopping all departures and landing all arrivals using solely radar and transponder data without the benefit of flight plans.

That network link was actually upgraded just two years ago, so that's not a lack of investment, but more likely murphy's law.


At the end of the day, it's spectacularly rare for the flight planning mainframe to enter an unexpected state, which shows the codebase is solid.

That the error was compounded by a further network problem was unfortunate, but the take home message is that when the system fell over, the contingency protocols were instigated, all aircraft were landed safely and no one died.

The thing is... I think we can all agree that Comolli wasn't the best person in the world to handle our transfers. Whilst it is difficult for us to imagine a better structure for the transfer committee (maybe there is one - who knows?), it is certainly easier to imagine a better DoF than Comolli. 

So, by virtue of mathematics: IF (Comolli = committee) AND (Good DoF &gt; Comolli) THEN (Good DoF &gt; committee).

false,djimonia,lfc99,,"&gt; letting your players go in their prime and signing young players with potential will never work if you want to consistently finish top 4  
  
Unless you're Arsenal. I think FSG consider Arsenal to be a great model - build a base of young talent and English players that will reliably get us into the UCL, make us a club that players would be happy to sign for - and in the vein of more recent Arsenal - hopefully attract world class players to try to push the team to a title-winning level. 

Unfortunately, right now we're at the circa-2000 Arsenal level (though it's looking more pessimistic). As with them then, we no longer have a solid defence, we have made some significant signings who haven't yet shown first team quality, and we have just started stadium improvement. We will see dividends in the coming years but the problem is that BR doesn't have the transfer control and squad base that AW had at the time. They coped well (and still do) losing their best players every year (Petit and Overmars left for Barcelona soon after he arrived) and we are not there yet.

My point is that we are still a while away from emulating Arsenal and consistently being in the top 4. That is the overarching goal for FSG at this time, I'm afraid to say. We had a good go at the title last year through a lot of luck and things clicking but with our limitations and recent history, we have to be realistic. I am optimistic that good times will come in the near future: we will play good football again and some of our signings will come good (like Henry and Pires eventually did, in the example above). Maybe BR will not eventually take us to the final level of PL / UCL winners, but he is good enough to get us in with a shout consistently, make no mistake.

My only downer about BR is that he is an unknown manager in the grand scheme of things - like Moyes, he will always struggle to pull big names and to tip the balance.

I really don't see any other way than commoditization.

Chemicals/Powders: You want certifiable standards for your pills or speed. You want guarantees of purity, consistency and strength. Scientifically measurable product. Think a wider-scale BB without the gangsters.

Imported stuff would have to go through the ports openly and be taxed as an import - it would still be cheaper than the price with criminal activity having to be factored in.

Selling at a price that would make it unviable for a criminal activity and with a guarantee of cleanliness and a certified strength in managed conditions where no one can buy more than their sufficient for their own consumption.

While they muddle along with it, the Dutch answer on weed is a nightmare. How can it be legal at the front door and illegal at the back?

The growth and transport of the bulk is entirely outside the law and criminality is without doubt still a major component of that system.

As a consumer the coffee shops are great, but the supply-side is ridiculous.

Why not licence farms or greenhouses in the UK to produce - and I mean grow strains of weed and make hash as per the market requirement - then supply it legitimately to licensed outlets. 

I'm certainly not advocating under any circumstance the dope alternatives that certain companies having been trying to produce.

The legit companies currently in green are tiny and still have problems with their bank accounts. WHat better time to really get a business going and do it properly - bottom up.

Oh sure, let everyone grow it at home if they wish -- just prior to tipping off UK component manufacturers that it's coming so they can get their product in front of the consumer in a timely fashion. 

UK Hydroponics anyone?

My law would be that a domestic operation could give it away but not sell it unless licensed - which makes it fine to do the HG bit but stops anybody setting up another black market - in principal anyway.

I'd try to ensure that the pricing doesn't make it viable anyway - while leaving enough room for smallholders to do it small-scale commercially - like micro breweries maybe.

But it has to be a much bigger picture than a farmer's market and the only way that would happen if governments and corporations work together - that way it can't be dismantled if someone has a change of heart.

Selling it out, maybe but anyone that thinks it was a cottage industry is kidding themselves.

FWIW, while getting all of this through I'd legalise prostitution and work with the collective how best to achieve that for the safety and security of all concerned. If we're declaring immoral earnings as part of our GDP we could at least get some tax out of it.

The largest parts of our welfare state outgoings are inflation linked, pensions, public sector pay, benefits ect. This will likely help bring the deficit lower. 

The lower cost of petrol (which is the driver of this) will feed into the economy like a tax cut for many people and business = more pounds in the pocket =  higher consumption = growth. Same thing with gas bills. 

Wages are starting to grow now which should mean we are generally speaking getting richer, as long as they are ahead of inflation. Hopefully puts an end to the cost of living crisis.

If we get to deflation, could stop people spending who wait for lower prices, bad for economy. 

Our debt is not being eroded away as quickly as it would through inflation. 

Could have a negative impact on tax revenues, from the pump and north sea. 

Could also hit investment and jobs in oil industry in north sea. 

Could create systemic failure if Russia collapses, banks start taking massive losess on oil investments, pension funds lose large chunks of their core investments ect.

The British government weren't about to try and tell the British public they couldn't have a drink so they decided to ban all of the recreational drugs as a compromise.

Look what an astounding success prohibition was in the states.

We just tightened up and sort of made everything properly illegal in the 70's.

With regard if the US does it everywhere will follow, is perfectly sound thinking and we always seem to be about ten years behind what happens stateside.

I can't be bothered doing the research, but I would guess we've only played away against 2, maybe 3 teams that were in the bottom half?

We played all the teams at the wrong time. And on top of those, we've also had to play against Chelsea, Everton and Swansea. All of these games are extremely difficult.

To me it's become clear last season was due to Suarez and Sturridge. We had the same issues with defense and midfield last year, and halfway through this year they still have barely even been addressed. Our midfield doesn't get forward enough, and our defensive positioning is horrid. 

A common theme is Moreno bombs forward and Lovren doesn't position himself to cover. Lucas is a band aid fix, but Rodgers is constantly moving him in and out of the team. Lucas needs to be starting every game when he can. He's not great at attack, which is probably why Rodgers doesn't want to play him (and counter to what I said earlier about our midfield not getting forward enough), but we simply can't afford to let in as many goals as we have been. More than that, though, is our defense looks like they have no idea what they're doing. They're not playing as a unit, but as individuals scrambling to deal with every threat on their own and getting caught out of position. That's something Rodgers should be addressing, but for whatever reason we've yet to see any sort of improvement there.

Transfers is another huge problem but that's where it might not be completely Rodgers fault. It probably more lies with FSG and their inexperience with football. They've set up a poor system. We've brought in so many young players when what we need is improvements to the first team. I think many of them could be good players, but the task is a bit too big for them given their age, and Rodgers system certainly isn't doing them any favors.

I very much doubt that, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you mean the rights delivered under PACE. In the UK, the Right to Remain Silent (which is the common understanding of the Right not to Incriminate Yourself) is not actually intact any more. You can remain silent, but the Police and juries may infer guilt from your refusal to answer a question, ergo: your right not to incriminate yourself no longer exists.

If a barrister asks a question, the answer to which is incriminating, you can either answer truthfully (and incriminate yourself), decline to answer it (in which case the jury will infer that you are guilty), or lie under oath (which is doable but you could introduce inconsistencies into your version of events which will eventually be outed).

&gt; I think you're being very disingenuous to the police here, **they've stopped a wholly wicked terrorist act** from happening and saved how ever many lives this plot would taken.

[No they didn't](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_July_2005_London_bombings). Of the five devices, 4 detonators went off but the explosives themselves dudded and the fifth device was dumped without being detonated.

That was July 21st, and there was a manhunt until the 29th when all the suspects were apprehended (during which period the Met managed to cause the death Jean Charles de Menezes in a case of mistaken identity).

The Met saved precisely -1 life and took 7 days to apprehend the suspects. They were just lucky that the bombers were incompetent and used low-grade peroxide.

&gt; but this is not a usual act of crime is it?

And? The law should be disregarded for crimes that are particularly heinous? On who's say so? Who makes the call that this is a sufficiently unusual crime that you can start disregarding bits of law at will?

The Judge Mr Justice MacKay (who presided over the trial of the failed Glasgow Airport bomber) stated:

&gt;“The seriousness of terrorist offences should never be a reason for anything other than the best of good practice”

And he's spot on. You cross every t, dot every i, leave *absolutely nothing to chance or interpretation*. The Police enforce the law *as is*. They are not permitted to say ""ah, they didn't think of this when they wrote the law, so we're going to disregard it because ""our case is special"""".

I mean, they can, but at that stage they become *exactly the same as you or I* if we decide to disregard the law - they have to stand up and defend themselves in court. And if the judge decides their case *isn't* that special and that they overstepped the mark, then in the worst case scenario it could cost them a conviction, set a criminal free, etc.",0,1418750487,null,0,1418816717,0,cmwort2,t3_2pgfgl,t1_cmwort2,t1_cmwnoyg,null,1425370293,8,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,8

there we go. That's what this all boils down to.

&gt; People like you created UKIP by making a level headed discussion about immigration toxic to the main parties for fear of racism. 

because by and large almost every single time people are talking about immigration its their fear and lack of understanding of foreign people that is driving them which is a key component of casual racism. I mean genuinely how many of these people that are complaining about immigration even know the figures?   
It remains that people see changes in their surroundings, dislike the changes and identify the items that seem the most different as the catalysts of those changes. If you're concerned over your old community consider the lack of funding local authorities now get from government. Stop looking the wrong fucking way and picking up the easy answers, put them down and find the more complicated ones.  

&gt; because big business want mass immigration to keep unskilled wages as low as possible and maximum elasticity in the labour market.

I think the more pressing concern is the pension chunk of welfare. We need more people to pay taxes to raise welfare in line with the age of the population. Also why don't we just campaign to increase minimum wage? That would actually do something as opposed to wasting our time overly worrying about immigration.  
I'm not stating that immigration has no effect but we'd all end up much better off by focusing on generating more as opposed to being less.

... and its not like we're not doing anything about it. ALREADY people can't come study here due to limits introduced in the past decade and ALREADY people are being deported even when married to a national because they don't earn enough so its not like UKIP and the immigration are on the back foot and floodgates are open.",0,1418750618,null,0,1418751135,0,cmwougj,t3_2pgdnd,t1_cmwougj,t1_cmwofai,null,1425370258,-2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-2

As for Moffat, I enjoy the darker tone that he has brought to Doctor Who. It's not the campy show that it was under RTD (a good show in its own right). Moffat seems to have created a more vibrant show. He is great at monster-creating and has penned/co-penned some of the best episodes of NuWho. 

However.

Moffat has left something to be desired with the longer story arcs. He has written some killer stand alone episodes, but falls short when going the distance. The idea of death was cheapened by continually erasing the deaths of characters. Most of 11's major plotlines were either rushed or left open at the close of his run.

It's not just Moffatt though. I remember an interview Gattiss did when describing the differences between writing for Doctor Who and Sherlock. He said something to the extent that Doctor Who was easier to write for because of the sonic screwdriver - it can be used as a magic wand to fix almost any situation. You can see that mindset in quite a few storylines, even in RTD's era.

I feel like I'm rambling. My point is that while Moffat has his flaws, so did RTD and everyone before them. At its core, Doctor Who is a children's show. It's meant to be fun. If you can't have fun with the show, then it may be time to move on.

Before you give up on it though, I'd recommend watching some Capaldi episodes - particularly 'Listen,' 'Flatline,' and 'Mummy on the Orient Express.'",0,1418751089,null,0,false,0,cmwp3yl,t3_2phdu2,t1_cmwp3yl,t3_2phdu2,null,1425370135,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

I don't think what FSG did does make sense on paper, putting together a group of people from different backgrounds, different experience and different ideas in their own minds to then somehow agree on what is needed by a single person. There needs to be an understanding of what is wanted across the board hence the need for Rodgers to have complete trust that the others who are voicing opinions on players know what it is Rodgers likes and doesn't like. I don't think that exists at the moment and if FSG can't have full faith in a manager then I don't think they should have hired him. As you've said, he refused to work under a Director of Football, if that's what they wanted then their decision to hire him anyway is the first mistake.


I'm not placing any blame on FSG either, at the time I think it would have been difficult to attract a better option. I do think it is a simple thing to look at though and doesn't need overcomplicating. Trust your manager, let them live and die by their decisions. These muddied waters just leaves scope for speculation and finger pointing which leaves a sour taste in the mouth.


The blaming is only likely to come from one source, the manager is the only one who is constantly questioned and in front of the cameras. I don't think he's ever been humble and has a track record of being stubborn.

false,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"I can only speak for myself, but I do think it was different, at least in some respects: 

* Manager: Rafa's record at the club couldn't be questioned. Consistent top 4 finishes, Champions League winners and runners-up, consistent European threat. Whilst results weren't going our way, I think most of us fans believed that Benitez could turn it around. Rodgers, for all his achievements last season, is still a relatively unknown entity - was last year a fluke or is this year a fluke? With Benitez, you didn't even ask that question

* Ownership: the season you are talking about marked the beginning of the end for the Hicks/Gillett ownership and we did see them in their worst of lights from thereon in. It really felt like 'Rafa and us vs. *them*' and, eventually, just 'us vs. them'. But at that point, the fanbase was still very much on the manager's side and increasingly united against the increasingly erratic American owners. Contrast that with now, where there is much more faith in our owners (even though this still isn't unequivocal) and our failings are more to do with mistakes being made on management level (I don't mean Rodgers here - I mean club management overall) rather than inherent instability/insecurity - so at least there is progress there 

* Competition: back in 09/10, there were arguably fewer teams challenging for top 4. United, Chelsea and Arsenal were the regular contenders. City were only just emerging as a credible threat. Spurs have always been Spurs-like. Now, there's a whole lot more competition and it isn't as easy for Liverpool to out-muscle other teams tactically, scout-wise or financially as it used to be

* History: in this respect, what is going on this season is both better and worse than the 09/10 season. After years of relatively stable success - regular Champions League, being considered one of Europe's best teams, often in the title race for at least part of the season - 09/10 brought a marked fall from our pedestal, which was painful to watch. There were all sorts of excuses and accusations thrown about and, as a fan, it was disheartening to watch our club being seemingly torn apart. However, there was still underlying belief that things would return 'back to normal' sooner rather than later (even though there were plenty who foretold this wouldn't be a one-off season). Fast-forward a few years and we became a bit blunted to the mediocre finishes. So, in a way, we should be used to it, which is why I say that this season is technically 'better'. But...as a contrast to last season... It gave one a lot of belief, that the slump was over, that it was back to regular and glorious Liverpool football. To see such confidence and promise fade so quickly and so easily... in a way, the crash is worse than in 09/10 

But that's just my take, as I said. I guess the biggest difference, in terms of emotional experience, is that in 09/10, you had a common enemy in the owners, someone whose removal would make the club great again. Now... not so much. Who is to blame? The owners? The players? The manager? The staff? It is difficult to say - probably a combination of all of these. But if all of these are to blame, what can change?

As I say, the main thing is they do have two totally independent systems feeding in:

* The flight data which comes from the flight plan and tells you where the aircraft should be and where it's planning on going (as well as whether it's passed any of it's waypoints - such as it being handed off into your sector from the previous controller)

* Radar and the transponders which tell you exactly where an aircraft is and which way it's flying but not the rest of it.

The flight data system is the one that went down, which made life very hard for controllers, but there was never any real risk of aircraft bumping into each other as they were still under radar control. ATC just had to halt departures so the controllers could focus on routing the airborne flights without the benefit of the flight data feed, as well as having to talk to other controllers manually to hand off flights into surrounding sectors, etc.",0,1418752275,null,0,false,0,cmwpsm9,t3_2ph0cu,t1_cmwpsm9,t1_cmwob0j,null,1425369820,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

&gt;The __Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging__ (*Afrikaner Resistance Movement*) (__AWB__) is a South African far right  [separatist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism) [political](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_organisation) and former paramilitary organisation, since its creation dedicated to secessionist [Afrikaner nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaner_nationalism) and the creation of an independent [Boer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boer)-[Afrikaner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaner) republic or ""*Volkstaat/Boerestaat*"" in part of South Africa. In its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s, the organisation received much publicity          both in South Africa and internationally as a [white supremacist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy) group.

false,SurrealistSwimmer,null,null,"&gt; weren't Sahin and Assaidi brought in on the efforts of another person rather than Rodgers? I don't think the committee was put in place after those flops.

Ah, I was unclear there - I meant to imply that Borini/Allen were signings made at his behest, the others (Sahin/Assaidi/Dempsey) have a more uncertain originator (although I recall it being fairly known that Rodgers didn't want Henderson in the squad, hence the 'trade' idea for Dempsey). If I remember correctly, he also wanted Sigurdsson. 

&gt; I don't think what FSG did does make sense on paper, putting together a group of people from different backgrounds, different experience and different ideas in their own minds to then somehow agree on what is needed by a single person.

You could argue this the other way as well - it does not make sense to expect one person to be an excellent tactician, good attacking/defence/fitness coach as well as a great scout. Some would argue Rafa's desire to be in charge of transfers ultimately proved his downfall (in addition to personality conflicts). A harmonised committee makes sense in the respect that a potential player is examined from multiple angles and by multiple people - if an agreement is made, then it is much more likely the player will fit in. If one person stubbornly wants a player and 4 other experienced football professionals disagree, then there might be something wrong with the player. 

&gt; There needs to be an understanding of what is wanted across the board hence the need for Rodgers to have complete trust that the others who are voicing opinions on players know what it is Rodgers likes and doesn't like. I don't think that exists at the moment and if FSG can't have full faith in a manager then I don't think they should have hired him. 

There needs to be an understanding, but that doesn't mean a manager needs to have a say over transfer policy. Many clubs are successful without the manager being in control of transfers - Barcelona, Madrid, Bayern, Ajax etc. Yes, the disharmony is a problem, but it isn't necessarily a fault of the system - it is more likely to be the fault of personnel. 

&gt; As you've said, he refused to work under a Director of Football, if that's what they wanted then their decision to hire him anyway is the first mistake.

Perhaps you're right here. It was a marriage of convenience, where both sides hoped the other would see things their way eventually. Turns out, that was not the case. 

&gt; Trust your manager, let them live and die by their decisions. These muddied waters just leaves scope for speculation and finger pointing which leaves a sour taste in the mouth.

As much as I would like things to be this simple, I don't think there is scope for an 'all-powerful' manager in modern football anymore. Managing duties are more likely to be fragmented amongst specialists operating as part of a unit - see my examples of clubs above. Unless one is a genius, but, as much as I do appreciate Rodgers, I don't think he is a big enough genius to run a club like LFC on his own. Rodgers was hired to make the team work tactically, to develop our young players and to have a *say* in the transfers. Last year it worked a treat. This year, he's under-performing on all three fronts and is laying the blame on the one side of things he doesn't have full control of. That is suspicious to me. 

&gt; The blaming is only likely to come from one source, the manager is the only one who is constantly questioned and in front of the cameras.

He is the one questioned, but he can choose not to put players/staff on the spot. The fact that all these things are a talking point is his own doing. 

&gt; I don't think he's ever been humble and has a track record of being stubborn.

Well, he did have that certain endearing awe about him when he took over. Short-lived, I guess. But yeah... I guess I should've focussed more on his apparent 'desire to learn', which doesn't seem to come across at the moment.

Why should a country rider who will mainly ride in the country be made to do inner city riding? If a country rider is gonna do that surely inner city riders should do country riding. Also the reason is seems so easy is because it is very split up. CBT teaches you the basics of riding and you learn how to ride in your own time, clutch control was the majority of what I spent my time doing while learning to drive a car.

I'd like to think in my words I've given people who adopt UKIP's position as much respect as I can afford. Like I said I'm not angry just disappointed and I don't think they're ""more racist"" than is natural but just that our natural distrust for things we don't know has a strong pull and many of these people have relented to its charms. 

&gt; Yes, for me it is about total number of people physically living in England ... it is just a question of logistics.

and this is a problem we can solve. Battening down the hatches on this country is going to doom future generations to being economically destroyed by rising economic superpowers in this new cold war of currency.  
Wealth is increasing globally and the countries we formerly ruled or kicked about are claiming a lot of that wealth, we have to keep up to ensure our country still has sufficient power in the future to secure our interests, otherwise we'd just get stomped in a tariff war. This is a big reason why being part of the EU block is compelling. It protects us.  
In terms of population density we aren't even close to fulfilling the potential population of this country and population is minds which is economy.  

&gt; We don't need mass immigration to pay for pensions, we have enough money.

I think you're underestimating the problem here. You know the the largest slice of their welfare bill by a country mile is pensions, like an average adult contributes smth like £250 a year to that pie while benefits that go to immigrants claim something more like a couple of pounds at best. Do you get my angle here?  
Couple that with a declining birthrate where we haven't seen our population replaced and you have an inverted pyramid. In a pyramid scheme this is not good news at all. Alternatives include cutting pensions or cutting other services to accommodate this rising cost. I don't think either of those is an option leaving us with a third option which is increasing revenue, which is much harder to do if you strangle population growth.  We should tax the rich more but that wont cover the growing welfare check without our own economic growth. In short we need people, I'm happy with the ""right people"" debate but to state we're ""too crowded"" goes against the model we have in place. We have to grow.

and while I do think politicians seem to idolise growth too much (I think there are many more indicators they need to take into account before feeling like they've done a good job with the economy), growth is critically important. It fuels the very finances that govern this country as well as safeguarding the pensions and money that this country has already made.  

My primary concern with UKIP is that they're extreme Tories using this blame plank to sell out to the Yanks. They'll come in, strangle immigration and pay for the pension gap by either cutting critical services or selling off assets to American corps and their friends in the short term. Once the problems persist they'll continue to brush the attention towards the immigrants already here. I don't think they represent good custodians for this country..... really no political party does but I feel like UKIP would just hasten our decline. The fact that they take on representatives that adore easy answers just demonstrate how awful they'd be in administration.",0,1418754351,null,0,1418754645,0,cmwr16a,t3_2pgdnd,t1_cmwr16a,t1_cmwpkw8,null,1425369238,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1
false,[deleted],null,null,"Always hard to answer ""in the UK"" questions like this without erroneously generalising, but with that said -

I've heard of all those people, watched several of their fights, and I wouldn't say that I follow boxing or am knowledgeable about it, whatsoever.  

I would guess (above disclaimer notwithstanding) if I asked everyone I know, be they friends/family/colleagues of all sorts of ages and backgrounds, ""who are Carl Froch, Amir Khan and David Haye"" that approaching 100% would get ""boxers"".

My logic would be that even the people who haven't _any_ real knowledge of boxing, have at least heard of Amir Khan, because he was a bit of a media darling in the olympics early in his career, so they would deduce the others.

Tbh Froch/Groves and Haye/Klitschko, Haye/Chisora were _all over_ the media too so unless someone is really dedicated to avoiding sports they would probably recognise the names.  Edit: oh and Calzage was on a TV dancing contest thing that is inexplicably massive here, so even if you do avoid sports you don't avoid boxers...

On the other hand the fights are almost always PPV and often at crazy times like 3am, so the number of people who are actively committed to watching/following I think would be much, much lower.  And the drop-off in interest from the big fights to lesser fighters would be much starker than the drop-off in crowds as you go down the FA pyramid, I'd expect.

false,seamushoo4,lfc68,,"no its better. we have owners who will back us with money if we need it, who actually care about winning and growing the lfc brand. as much as our ""true supporters"" hate it, football is a business. that means charging more for tickets, pushing more jerseys and selling naming rights to main stand, kop and even the stadium as a whole, would be beneficial. we need more sponsors to keep pace, and we need cl to be elite. but the valuation of the team is approximately 700m (dollars, only because it's coming off of forbes, sorry) and the team is bringing in revenues of 313m (dollars again)...those numbers are up significantly from when they bought the team in 2010...in addition, they have reduced our debt greatly, have come up with a plan to redevelop our iconic stadium (by loaning lfc the money from their own pockets) and have pumped 200m+ into the squad in the form of transfers. although those transfers have been poor, they have shown a willingness to do what it takes to win, to do what it takes to make us competitive, because ultimately it makes them money. They bought liverpool for 476m in 2010, almost 5 years ago, and that valuation has almost doubled. interestingly enough, this makes me really happy b/c as our debt deflates more and more, and the more renovations that are done to anfield, the more valuable the club is. so my opinion on the issue, with a view on on the owners, is positive and we are in much more stable shape than hicks and gillet. remember we were hours away from administration b/c of those two assholes (and im american, americans hate them..) and that's partially a reason why our team took 5 years to rebuild. in addition, think about this, we had just purged several of our most valuable assets, including alonso, masch, and torres was sold shortly after their purchase of lfc b/c of his unhappiness with the team and everything. so no wonder our team didn't make cl for years after, we purged our best assets (minus stevie and carra of course) and replaced them with utter shite. 

Fast forward through year and a half of kenny, who did bring pride back to the club, who brought our family together and kept the fans stable in the face of unstable circumstances and FSG decide to hire one of the brightest young managers in the BPL, Brendan Rodgers. They targeted two of the only 4 coaches I wanted at anfield at the time (BR, martinez, klopp and avb...shudders avb was a no no but i wanted him) and got their man in BR. martinez would have been equally as pleasing to get, but don't kid yourselves if you think martinez would have done better than BR. the only way he would have is if he came in and won the league, and that wasn't realistic considering BR ""overachieved"" by getting 2nd. 

Anyways BR is a better manager than we could have asked for at the time. He was respectful of the club's history, management and was truly humble in the way he approached the press. Yes he is a bit arrogant, yes he is cocky, yes he mumbles on about the same shit, but that is the way i like it. Shankly, had he not produced, would have been seen as arrogant. Shankly was confident. but shankly did say what was on his mind, but wasn't under the microscope that coaches are under now. and shankly did take 4 years before his first league title. BR almost did it in 2 years, is having a blinder of a season now and is the manager to move forward with. the problem i have with people asking for him to leave or be fired, if you fire br today, arsenal will fire wenger and pick up BR and win championships. i guarantee it. he is the coach we want, he is a futuristic coach and he has great tactical acumen. 

our players are also built for the future too. it won't be super difficult to keep hold of them because they know they're stuck here until FSG want to sell them. but we have sterling, marko, cout, can, moreno, manq, ilori, sahko, lovren, rossiter, sterling, ibe, wisdom, alberto, origi, studge, balo and so many more that are all 25 or under. our team is young, we have time on our sides and don't need to get too hasty. unfortunately we are suffering right now, but i think we are in WAY better shape than we were before.

false,StillWill,lfc68,,"It's almost surreal seeing this happen to a professional team...I play in a rec league, and for one game last season, our captain had us play a back 3. I normally play left back, and was put on the left side of the back three. There was really no instruction for our wingers to play as wing-backs. The back three was told to keep it's shape, tight and narrow, and not to drift wide. What was the result? The opposition wingers had all the space in the world down the wings. Even when our wingers were back marking their wingers, I was still supposed to stay right next to our central CB, much like Lovren does in these examples. So the opposing fullback was free to make an overlapping run with acres of free space. There was no defensive midfielder in charge of filling that space. Nothing. 

It was ridiculous. We might have just rolled out the carpet for the other team to play with the ball in our final third. I remember at half time, walking to the sideline, and hearing some of the other guys talking...""You mean the wing was just wide open?"" - ""Yeah, man, nobody out there, can't believe it""...Or something along those lines. 

It was so obvious that this system doesn't work unless there is someone there to fill that space. Luckily, my winger in front of me pretty much played as leftback to help me out, so my job was easy. I basically just patrolled a very small portion of the pitch, and by the end, I was desperate to get forward just because I felt like I hadn't even exercised properly. But our winger being back defending meant that he wasn't available when we won the ball and went on the attack. Our central center back didn't understand this. The exchange went something like this: 

CW: ""Jake, you need to be up there to attack.""

Winger: ""Well, I'm back helping StillWill defend...With this formation, he can't be there to mark their winger.""

CB: ""Yeah, but StillWill has it down.""

This has turned into some rant, but I guess it really comes down to the fact that teams really have three formations: Formation when attacking, when attempting to win the ball back around midfield, and when defending.

&gt;
&gt;The Doctor lays an unmoving River Song on the floor of the TARDIS, terrified she is dead. He prepares to give her mouth-to-mouth, but realises she is only holding her breath with her eyes closed. She gets up to flirt with him.
&gt;She has escaped from Stormcage and asked some Sontarans if they were out on a hen's night, only for them to chase her halfway across the galaxy. As he chastises her, she notices the gold dress he has chosen for her for their visit to Caldoron Beta hanging near the console. She demands to know whom he has brought and storms up the stairs to find the hussy. A second later, the earlier River returns from the TARDIS wardrobe, demanding to know whom he is talking to. She returns to the wardrobe. The older River returns, demanding to know whom the Doctor is speaking to. When he denies talking to anyone, she resumes her hunt.
&gt;A third River enters the TARDIS, actually wearing the gold dress. This River was expecting to meet the Doctor here, but on seeing the dress hung by the console, asks why he has bought another. The Doctor asks her to step outside to check if the light on top of the TARDIS is working. She does.

Plus with the time it would take to settle him into our squad, culture, and build his confidence; it wouldn't be worth it imo.

Finally, we all knew and talked about the problems with our defence last season.  Rogers hasn't properly addressed that.... in reality, we've regressed - regressed from an already bad position.

As much as I'd like Rodgers to be sacked, just to get a breath of fresh air, I believe he needs to be given till the end of the season. Regarding his abilities as a manager, I still think he has what it takes. My opinion has never changed. He did a very good job at Swansea, bear in mind he had a decent team there - good defenders and energetic midfielders. And he should be allowed to weather the storm and work with our players over next summer.

BR has changed over the past year though, with respect to his arrogance. Every game is a good game, and he apparently has positives to take from every game. He is a good 'Salesman' and always diplomatically correct, but he needs to realize that we arent dumb enough to buy this everytime. Something's gotta change there...

P.S.: I believe our primary issue right now is with respect to our midfield. We have sucked balls ever since we left Mascherano leave. Gerrard isnt quick enough to trackback to be a good DM, and I have to agree with Lovren that he leaves the defence exposed. A good tackling Quarterback may be A solution, not THE solution.

It was a fantastically risky gambit, for a number of reasons:

 1. You can't just rock up in court with a whole bunch of evidence; you need to submit that to the CPS in advance of the actual case.
 1. Once you do that, they can wheel out expert witnesses and such - and if they succeed in persuading the magistrate, it'll be at your expense.
 1. From what others have said, it sounds like it wasn't enough of a discrepancy to say he wasn't speeding. And as far as the law is concerned, speeding is speeding. The amount you're speeding by may affect the punishment, but it won't affect you being convicted and punished.

I also kinda hated the logic he had with the rotations of Skrtel and Agger last year. Agger probably felt pretty shitty being made vice captain and not really featuring much. I know many people say it was due to Rodgers likely trying to show off Skrtel's talent to attract buyers when there was constant talk of him leaving in winter window.  

Obviously that wasn't in the cards(despite Skrtel's departure being talked about that entire summer) due to him proving the be a good asset. Either way it definitely turned off Agger, which I felt super bad for him.

As far as other stuff goes, this summer window Rodgers kinda made the classic mistake of buying people who either worked super well for one team but not for Liverpool's setup or buying expensive for the future when there's not a whole lot of adjusted options.

It would (hopefully) give him a chance to improve his form, show what he can really do, and show what his prefered position/playstyle is. His value would definitely improve, especially among foreign leagues (maybe include a very high loan-to-buy clause in his contract). 

Or, we could keep him the next year to see how he has improved.

Also have a Thai friend where I currently live who went to University of Liverpool for four years and aside from the fact he got mugged once he's never brought up any bad experiences of the city. 

It's a complex question, but in general Liverpool is a pretty left-wing and socialist city (as are most cities in the north) and as areas in the UK go I'd say the racism is pretty low. The number of [UKIP votes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-27576104) is lower than most of the rest of the UK in the region (I'm aware UKIP isn't synonymous with racism but there's probably a correlation).

The city has a very mixed ethnicity, with a sizeable Irish population and also a fairly strong Chinese community from the old docker workforce, which used to have quite a lot of labour from China. I'd say softer racial elements like humour based on racist stereotypes are maybe more prevalent and accepted than in other places I've lived, but despite it being a bit questionable, it's usually good-natured rather than malicious. It manifests itself in a few ways, for example I'd say that using the colloquial term ""Chinky"" for Chinese is far more accepted in Liverpool than it is in the south of England (where it would be considered blatantly racist), though typically its use in Liverpool isn't in a way that's intended to cause offence and it's more just another part of the slang of the area. 

Basically, I would say if there's racism in Liverpool (and there probably is, you get assholes everywhere) it's no worse or more malicious than anywhere else in the UK. If anything Scousers identify to an extent as a minority group within the UK ([*""We're not English, we are Scouse""*](http://cdn.live4liverpool.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/The-Kop.jpg)) and that probably creates an affinity towards actual non-White British minorities in the city.

He was interested in the ""idea"" of her (the impossible girl). That's the only thing that snapped him out of his funk after Amy and Rory were gone, and he basically stalked the poor girl and dragged her into being a companion just because she was ""impossible"".  Then, after sending her away twice during Trenzalore, he guilt trips her into staying after he regenerates.

So, she stays, and turns out she's addicted to the ""idea"" of the Doctor even though she readily admits he treats her like garbage. Their relationship is a mess of codependency and dysfunction, and it's truly tainted all of the stories so far with Twelve. He shines when she's not around, and she's almost tolerable away from him. Together, they're painful to watch. Even when saying what should have been their last goodbyes, they can't even be honest or sincere.

I hear tell rumor that Clara is staying around for part of the 9th season. I hope, sincerely, that it's not for very long and that her story has an ending that precludes her ever coming back. Give her Rose's or Donna's fate and send her away forever (or nearly). Let Capaldi's Doctor have a companion worthy of being a companion and not some Stockholm Syndrome addled woman-child.

I think this is a bit different in today's context. Finishing in the top four is a more difficult task now than it was for most of Rafa's reign given that Man City have joined the party (as you acknowledge later on in your post). Our performance in the Champions League was usually good, but domestically we seemed to misfire pretty much every season under Rafa *except* for the one we came second. The only reason we didn't drop out of the top four was because there was a pretty big gap back then between the 'Big Four' and the likes of Villa, Spurs and Everton. 

Our league finishes under Benitez weren't really any better or worse than our league finishes under Houllier with the squad he inherited, except for his last season when we came 7th. I feel to a degree that was why he lost support of a lot of fans at the end of his time at the club - he'd done great things in the Champions League but his league record was no better than the man he replaced. I agree where you say he had a more proven track record than Rodgers, but with the amount he spent it did become easier to question at the end whether Rafa was ever going to bring us a league title.

What you're describing would really be a graduate tax, which unfortunately the current system is. 


The fact that payments can be made up-front and there is no financial penalty for early repayment means that actually those who go on to earn the most or whose parents can pay up front (groups with considerable overlap!) do not pay back a proportionally increased amount. Instead it is those who go on to earn middle-incomes with fairly average salaries that pay the most. I think this is part of the uproar and in fact my greatest issue with the system. As the debt increases at RPI (the one that's usually higher than CPI unfortunately!) + 3% whilst studying and at RPI + up to 3% for salaries up to £41,000 the increased amount paid by long-term repayees (ie middle income earners) does more than just account for inflation.",0,1418758658,null,0,false,0,cmwtmf8,t3_2pdnrc,t1_cmwtmf8,t1_cmvzqtv,null,1425368029,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

If you're interested you can read a summary [here](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/1114/051114-economic-impact-EU-immigration), and the actual report [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12181/abstract). The 'key' figures are in Table 6 on page 26:

| Period | EEA contribution | non-EEA contribution |
|:---| ----: | ----: |
| 1995-2011 | £4,425m to £28,170m | -£117,961m to -£59,618m |
| 2001-2011 | £20,216m to £28,730m | £5,207m to £20,502m |

So the £20bn benefit figure is the bottom left, while the £120bn cost is from the top right.

There are two key things to note about this. The first is in footnote 3 (page 2):
&gt; It should be noted that these two groups are different. Analysis of the first group provides a simple ‘snapshot’ of a population at different points in time but depends on the demographic composition of the immigrant population at respective measurement points, which in turn depends on historical migration pattern. Analysis of the second group, in contrast, allows us to make statements about the fiscal contributions of complete arrival cohorts observed from entry to the UK onwards.

Which is what I said earlier about the first group being ""all immigrants in the UK during this time, including those have been here for decades"" and the second being ""immigrants who have arrived in this time period.""

On page 36 the authors discuss the £118bn cost figure, noting:

&gt; This finding may partly be explained by the larger number of children non-EEA immigrants have over the period considered, whose cost we assign to immigrants while assigning these children’s contributions after entering the labour market to natives. Yet this strategy, necessitated by a lack of information in our data set on the foreign born status of immigrants’ parents, is likely to overestimate (rather than underestimate) the relative cost of immigrants in all our computations.

So they are considering many of the costs of these immigrants, while ignoring some of the benefits. So the £118bn figure is probably an overestimate.

The trend graphs on pages 27-28 are also worth looking at.

There are a couple of articles discussing the difference in reporting [here](http://www.channel4.com/news/immigration-migrants-economy-newspapers-mail-telegraph) and [here](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/05/telegraph-mail-headline-migrants-cost-contribution). The second is from the Guardian, so you might dismiss it as being ""pro-immigration"", but a couple of key quotes from it are as follows:

&gt; Dustman and Frattini say it is misleading to use the £118bn figure as the Telegraph and Mail have done. As they point out, this is based on the cost of all immigrants living in Britain between 1995 and 2011. This isn’t migrants who arrived in Britain in the late 1990s and 2000s but all the non-UK born people living in Britain at that time. More than 90% of them will have arrived in Britain long before 1995, including Britain’s large long-settled Asian and Caribbean communities who were born abroad.

&gt; The authors say that, for example, the calculation will include people who came to Britain in 1950 but only what they paid into the state and took out in benefits and public services after 1995.

&gt; The authors say this doesn’t tell us anything about how much these people have cost Britain in net terms because it ignores their contribution during the first 45 years of their residence.

&gt; “In fact, as they are now older, they are likely to have higher rates of welfare dependency and low labour force participation that does not reflect their overall contributions,” say the authors.

The first part of [this blog post](http://creamcomments.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/nothing-is-hidden-in-our-report-on.html) by the authors may also be of interest. It brings out the point that for this period (1995-2011) the UK had a budget deficit, meaning that *all* people will be being a net drain (which makes the net contribution of EEA migrants over this period even more surprising). The non-EEA contribution is closely following the native population. Which, again, we might expect given that 90% or so of them had been in the UK already for many years.",0,1418759442,null,0,false,0,cmwu3fo,t3_2pgdnd,t1_cmwu3fo,t1_cmwr3zr,null,1425367809,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

Even more important is that the Tories know that they don't have the mandate for this. It is completely at odds with their pre-referendum position and they will never get majority support from either Scottish MPs (recall that they only have one) or the Scottish Government.

The Welsh case was another that I'd forgotten about; and was under the stricter rules of the CJIA (among others).

false,aaronhere,null,null,"Not particularly having a stake in the Rodgers In/Out fight, this seems like a good spot for some musings.  Firstly, Redknapp acknowledges that Rodgers has made a lot of mistakes this year and that we will have trouble with a championship team.  That seems like faint praise, at best.  Anyway, moving on.

**Transfers** have been a hot topic of late.  There are a whole bunch of intersecting problems here (committee vs Rodgers, lack of funds, wrong type of targets, settling for second choices) all highlighted by the opacity of the process.  We still don't know how decisions are made regarding bringing in players.  Although this is an often-enjoyable topic of conversation, I think it is the one least damning of Rodgers as we just don't know enough about the process to lay blame at any one person's feet.

**Lineups** I seriously have no idea what is going on here.  Rodgers talks of meritocracy and the dropping of passengers, and yet neither of these seems to be happening.  Can, Lucas, and Kolo saw generally good performances rewarded with more time on the bench.  Specifically, they seemed to add solidity to the defensive side of the ball, so it makes such little sense that they were dropped against United.  In addition, Gerrard has played more minutes that Hendo this year and appears undroppable/unsubbable, even after strings of below-par performances. Lovren?  Why he has had so much playing time (and never with Lucas, I might add) seems absurd.  Sakho is probably our best defender, and yet barely played before his injury. Johnson has been mostly down (with one impressive highlight reel goal) yet still features regularly.  In a team that thrives on pace and pressing, the complete absence of Borini can only be political.  He is no world beater, but in a team built for speed and pressing if our front two are Lambert and Gerrard, things are fucked.  How Borini doesn't even make the bench is beyond me.  Suarez is not walking through that door, and Rodgers need to play with the players he has, not the players he wishes they were.  And the substitutions this year?  How many times have we seen our top performer subbed off? Hindsight is 20-20, as they say, but some of the lineup decisions have been baffling.

**Tactics** Why we bring in Balo and refuse to play 2 up top remains a mystery.  Why Gerrard lasted so long as a totally-not-a-dm DM (or a deep lying playmaker with no one to make plays to) is also confusing.  Or how about needing to WIN a champions league match against Basel and putting out this lineup: Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Lovren, Enrique, Lucas, Allen, Henderson, Gerrard, Sterling, Lambert.  We could play that lineup for 10 EPL games and I am guessing we would score about 3 goals.  I largely don't care what formation we lineup in, as long as there appears to be an a) plan, and b) approach that gets the best out of the players available.  Neither of these appear to be happening.  

**Defense** I was going to include this in tactics, but thought it deserved its own section.  How we have been so consistently poor on this side of the ball is confounding.  And its not just the the team doesn't defend well, its that the same mistakes are seemingly made by the same players over and over again.  2nd balls on corner kicks, FB's not tracking back, CB's out of position, DM's not covering their areas or tracking runners -  they have been problems for 2 seasons!  How many times do you feel confident when the team gives up a corner kick or turns the ball over in the opposition 18 that we have things covered and everything will be ok?  The refusal to address these issues, or (in the case of ignoring Lucas) seeming to deny that an issue exists in the first place, is probably my biggest complaint about Rodgers.  That we played United with a 2-man midfield of Gerrard/Allen is, for me, symptomatic of some of these problems.


None of this is to say he should be gone - but I think it does indicate that change is needed.  I would prefer Rodgers takes a step back and evaluate the team with a fresh set of eyes - and ideas - devoid of nostalgia (Gerrard) or favor (Lovren).  If he can't, or won't, then how are any of these problems going to get fixed?

false,seemylolface,lfc12,,"I don't necessarily disagree, this is good discussion! I do think Balo is a better finisher than Borini.  However, I also think our shitty defense and sub-par midfield comes down to tactics and personnel that aren't midfielders though.  I think with Balotelli as the lone forward you're completely sacrificing the pressing game, so you can't defend at high pressure from the front the way we did last season.  When you do this you put a lot more pressure on the midfield.  Combine that with having Gerrard sitting at the base of the midfield and you're asking for disaster defensively.  It fully exposes our CBs as the midfield can't cope and there's nothing in front of it.  think of it as the forwards are the first defenders.

I think if you bring energy back to the top of the formation and revitalize the high pressure game then we protect the midfield more, which in turn relieves pressure from them and the defense.  

Beyond that, Balotelli is not, and never will be solid as a lone striker.  He's said it himself, it's not how he's excelled at any point in his career.

Lallana is 26, Lovren is 26, Balotelli is 25. These three should be in their prime.

false,youcanfeelme,null,null,"It says she had trouble reconciling her religious upbringing and beliefs with her homosexuality. Can that be right? Let's see what she would have found googling the [catholic catechism](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s2c2a6.htm):

&gt;2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. 

So far so good. No reason to feel bad about it so far, seems perfectly nice to me.

&gt;Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity,141 tradition has always declared that ""homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.""142 

&gt;They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved.

Well yes, that would be quite distressing for a homosexual Christian teenager I can imagine. That would certainly alter the way I see myself when I look in the mirror. Let's see what else it has to say:

&gt;2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. 

&gt;They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition.

Ah well, that's not so bad. I mean sure the original statement says you're worthless to the species with no reason to live and against natural order and God himself, but it's okay! They tell people to be nice to you *anyway*. Self image restored! 

&gt;2359 Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.

A life devoid of sex? Well I guess you *could* go without if you wanted, no big deal. A life of chastity sounds like a life worth living to me. The sexual frustration, loneliness, shame and guilt can easily be pushed to the back of your mind with a bottle of voddy or some drugs anyway. 

I simply can't understand why so many Christian homosexuals commit suicide or are outcasted by their parents. The consensus seems perfectly harmless to me.

*Dear Joe*

*Thank you very much for taking the time to contact me in relation to the NHS, I appreciate you doing so.*

*It is concerning that an agreement has not been reached in relation to NHS pay. Staff in the NHS do a hugely important job and deserve to be treated fairly. It is thereforce extremely important that both ministers and the unions take a sensible approach to negotiations to ensure that staff are not adversely affect for any longer than necessary.*

*Prifate Finance Initiatives (PFI) were first introduced by the last conservative Government and saw a considerable expansion under the previous Labour Government. Labour strongly opposed PFI whilst in opposition but introduced far more projects via this form of funding than had been done before.*

*The impact of PFI has been less than convincing and has been hugely controversial since its introduction in the early 1990‘s. This form of financing is still firmly supported by Labour. I do support the NHS remaining a public body, as my voting record shows, and will continue to support positive reforms that improve and support essential front line services.*

*I have always been a keen supporter of maintaining services within the NHS and this includes keeping hospitals open. I have done a lot of work locally in relation to the Wharfedale Hospital and the need to make more use of it. I would certainly oppose any hospital closure in the constituency or Leeds as a whole.*

*The TTIP is certainly controversial. There are a number of aspects about the proposal which would prove beneficial the UK and UK businesses, however there are clear concerns over the inclusion of ISDS. These concerns are widespread and Jean Claude Juneker has recently removed the autonomy of the Trade Commissioner in relation to ISDS. I also recently voted for a Private Members Bill which seeks to exempt the NHS from the TTIP negotiations. I will certainly continue to monitor progress of the negotiations and raise ongoing conerns with ministers.*

*The NHS should always remain free at the point of delivery and should not become a two-tier system. Such moves would not be in the interests of the British public and would rightly be met with serious criticism.*

*Once again, thank you for contacting me in relation to these issues and please do not hesitate to get in touch on this or any other issue in the future.*

*Yours sincerely*

*Greg Mulholland MP*
*Leeds North West*

**My Letter**

*﻿Dear Greg Mulholland*

*On Monday the 24th of November NHS staff in England And Northern Ireland are to strike again. This follows years of pay freezes and caps with Jeremy Hunt still refusing to meet to settle this dispute leaving our most valuable public servants with no choice but to take further action.*

*GMB conducted an official ballot of 22,000 members in the NHS in England and Northern Ireland. There was overwhelming support for industrial action against the government’s and employers’ pay policies. The pay offer is an unconsolidated 1% pay award in 2014 restricted to staff not eligible for incremental progression, and the same approach in 2015. This goes against the recommendation of the independent NHS Pay Review Body for a 1% consolidated pay rise for all staff.*

*I hope you, will support the strike in person or in spirit and will lend your voice to the voiceless and ignored health workers of our nation by writing to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urging him to meet with the Unions and reach a fair resolution.*

*I also hope you could confirm that you support a publicly funded and run NHS, and would appreciate if it you could confirm if you agree with the following statements to make your position clear.*

*1:  Private Finance Initiative (PFI) should be removed from the NHS with existing contracts renegotiated or brought out at the soonest possible opportunity.*

*2: We should fully oppose the EU-USA trade deal (TTIP) that makes NHS privatisation irreversible while it contains any ISDS clauses, acknowledging that any attempt to exempt the NHS from such a deal will be futile while such a clause exists*

*3: A two or multi-tier heath service with uneven standards and service provision is immoral and unacceptable, the marketisation of the NHS should be undone with the abolition foundation status hospitals / trusts and their reintegration back into the NHS.*

*4: Health care services should be free at the point of delivery for all service users, means testing should not be required to access services.*

*I would appreciate a clear yes or no answer to each point, and while any elaboration on your reasoning would be welcome, the clarity of your position on these matters is of paramount importance with the General Election taking place in the next six months.*

*Finally I like many other local residents would like to thank you again for voting against the 2012 Health and Social Care Act.*

*Warm Regards*

1) the estate agents will probably want to know how much you earn and run a credit  check. There is a chance they will deem you unfit to be a guarantor. So you could get out of it at the last  minute without even wanting to.

2) The guarantor thing sometimes turns out to be a mere formality. by this i mean, if she knows she can't pay rent she can give the landlord/agent some notice saying she can't pay rent and will be leaving. At this point the landlord/agent will be much more keen to find a new tenant which Is a lot easier (not to mention cheaper e.g: if you were intentionally to be difficult or simply move abroad) than chasing  you up for 500 pm which  can require bringing  in a solicitor.

1. They don't have to suspend you, they can use their discretion by dealing with it informally. This appears to be an informal resolution. If you fail to comply with the informal resolution, they could escalate to the formal process. They might attempt to use the fact that you didn't cooperate at the informal stage during formal processes. You can probably request that they deal with it formally to ensure procedure is followed...but do you really want to force them to suspend you?

2. Breach of data protection laws would probably be a separate matter...but could be relevant to a claim of constructive dismissal. However, for constructive dismissal to exist, you have to quit your job. I'd never recommend to anyone to quit their job in order to proceed with a constructive dismissal claim. However, they might counter-argue that by accessing that computer you have committed offences under the Computer Misuse Act. The fact that it was open and unlocked doesn't allow you to sit down and access data on it.

3. Police, no...unless you are being taken to court for the offence. Producing expert witnesses is expensive, and is only usually appropriate during court proceedings.

false,SoyBeanExplosion,eng-yorkshire,York/Cambridgeshire,"Nah. We support a referendum but would campaign for a sort of 'qualified' remaining in the EU. As I said, we believe the EU has the potential to be a source for real good. Greater co-operation with European partners is a great thing, a level of supra-national government means that we can avoid the 'tragedy of the commons' issue on some important areas (which helps us to make real progress tackling climate change and other environmental issues, for example), and the existence of the European Court of Human Rights is a positive influence on our government, keeping some of its excesses in check.

The problem is that, the way we see it, a lot, or most, of the time, the EU seems to actually work for the benefit of multinationals and massive corporations. It doesn't do a good enough job helping small, local businesses (which are, after all, what we should be encouraging) compete and prosper in that single market. And there's a bigger problem which is the undemocratic structure of the EU, particularly with too much centralisation of powers. We want many powers to be devolved back into local communities so that they have more say in the things that affect them.

[This](http://greenparty.org.uk/news/yes-to-an-eu-referendum-green-mp-calls-for-chance-to-build-a-better-europe.html) is what Caroline Lucas wrote in her amendment on the Green's policy on an EU referendum as their goal:

&gt;[The Greens] seek to build support for radical reform of the EU, increasing its transparency and accountability, refocusing its objectives on co-operation and environmental sustainability rather than competition and free trade, and enabling member states to exercise greater control over their own economies. 

So on the whole I would say that we *are* for remaining in the EU, but we're much more skeptical of the EU than either Labour or the Liberal Democrats.",0,1418767910,null,0,false,0,cmwz9r7,t3_2pgyl8,t1_cmwz9r7,t1_cmwyqdj,null,1425365325,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Once we get the midfield rodgers wants, where the strikers are running the channels and we can exploit the gap, then Lallana is going to become even better (although I've thought he was our best player in a couple of games so far). 

Moreno is young, but he's shown a lot of potential, and give him a couple of years in the premier league, and he'll be one of the best LBs in the world - I rate him that highly. All of his flaws are ones that are based off of youth, inexperience, and not reading the game well enough - easily fixed through play time and expected. 

Can offers nothing over Allen, Lucas, Hendo at this point. We overpaid for him, but he might come good.

Markovic has shown sparks but they're very, very fleeting. He hasn't been given much opportunity. 20m seems like a lot now, but he's so young and coming from Portugal, its not like he was bought for this season, so I'm going to hold judgement.

Lovren has been caught out of position so many times its laughable, also he's inconsistent as hell with aggressiveness in the box. At times he's a dominant power house whose able to clear everything, other times he shies away and gives the target man too much time and space. He definitely hasn't looked like a 20m pound man.

Balo has been horrific - 16m pound gamble, didn't pay off, move on. He doesn't fit the system at all, and hasn't produced anything to demonstrate that he's still a top striker. 

Lambert's done well for what he was brought in to do. Exceeded expectations IMO, considering he was brought in to play the last 15 minutes against teams who were parking the bus. Great signing, pity that expectations for him have jumped just because others are underperforming.

It shouldn't have been nearly as easy as it was for him, that was disgraceful no doubt, but not tracking the most dangerous man through midfield to the edge of your box? Mind blowing 

Edit: also the four issues you're talking about, most are one big issue really - ""pressure, cover, balance"". It's the first thing we learn about defending and they've fucked it. The ball is pressed, not as well as it could be but it's pressed - Lovren needs to provide that cover and the two lads need to shift with him and provide the balance, that will allow Hendo to tuck in. It's criminal from Lovren not covering the man pressing the ball because he's basically creating a 1v1 (I know there were two men pressing, but for examples sake normally). But Coutinho not tracking that runner has created a goal scoring threat around in our box.

I think he's getting better, but he's still got so far to go and his attitude seems so poor that I doubt he'll ever get there.

false,MICOTINATE,null,null,"I think considering the recent performances and the injuries/ suspensions Koeman needs to consider changing our shape.

The 4-3-3 looks very impressive in games like the one we had against Sunderland. But for a while now the midfield has looked far too disconnected from the attack, the attack looks chaotic and teams have been able to find oceans of space when they attack us because the fullbacks are going forward and Wanyamderlin are getting stretched too thin.

More than anything the disconnect from midfield and attack I think is what's killing us. The only time we've looked dangerous in the past half dozen games is when Davis has burst out of midfield and played a 1-2 with Pelle. It opens up the game, actually pulls defenders out of shape a bit and when it's happened the wide players look dangerous again. Otherwise we're just longballing, it gives nothing for the attackers to work with, and it's incredibly easy for a defence to handle. 

I'd like to see some variation of a 4-4-2. 

* Mane's total disregard for consistency or reliability might actually be more problematic for defences and less for us with him wide mid rather than a forward. He'll get a chance to run at people which seems to be the best of his abilities right now bless him. He just isn't good enough to be the guy actually receiving the ball in attack right now, so let him cause trouble elsewhere. 

* Pelle and Long can take it in turns to pick the ball up deep, actually turn and face the goal for a change, work on building a good understanding with each other and get their in-possession confidence back. Rather than just being expected to try and bring down long balls or take snap shots at half-chances.

* Clyne and Bertrand don't need to overlap. At the moment they're our only width and everyone knows it. A 4-4-2 gives us natural width without the fullbacks, meaning they can actually test the opposition winger's discipline instead of just ""arriving as expected"" every time we attack.

* One of the centre-mids can do a better job of linking that attack together. If a striker comes deep, this guy makes a run beyond him, if both strikers charge the box this guy carries or receives the ball halfway so we don't need to play those mental long passes any more.

Yes we have squad limitations, yes we don't have the quality other teams do but that doesn't explain how pretty much the same group of guys can be so poor when they were playing so well previously.

She declined the money and presumably walked home, and then she said ""I'm going to do some research on that guy that offered me 3 quid!"" Turns out that he's homeless!

Before you downvote me, please let me know if I misunderstood the article. That's what I gathered from it. And it doesn't seem like a particularly believable story. 

Nor does the Independent's opening line of their article: 

&gt;Christmas is a traditionally a time for giving, particularly to the less fortunate members of society, but one homeless man **was prepared to hand over everything he had.**

Over half the fuel sold in the UK is via supermarket, so apparently plenty of people (myself included.) 

All fuel sold in the UK must meet specific UK standards, in addition to EU standards (BS EN 228:2008 if you care.)
All base fuels are the same, and generally come from the closest refinery to your chosen filling station, the additives vary between petrol station.

The additives may effect the performance of your engine, but this will generally be limited to older engines, engines made within the past 20 years will really seen no difference. They will not reduce the life of the engine at all.

Often supermarket petrol stations contract out fuel, so in many cases you could be getting exactly the same fuel and additive package as you would with Shell or BP.

Presuming you aren't racing anywhere and you've got a fairly modern vehicle, the performance will be so slight in difference that you won't be able to notice. 
Plenty of consumer tests have shown the difference in negligible.

Hate to say it, but most people who perceive a difference are imagining it. Not saying that because I think they are wrong, but I am saying that because it's been backed up time and time again with figures. 

From my experience, a tank of Tesco fuel lasts just as long as a tank of Shell despite driving a car with a 17 year old engine design, but Tesco fuel costs me at the very least 20p less. That sort of decision isn't hard to make.

false,socalpro,null,null,"This may be an unpopular opinion but I think we really only have 1 goal threat in our starting 11.  That man is Diego Costa.  The other attacking options all seem to be pass first guys, even Hazard, whose finishing has quite a bit of room for improvement. 

Yes, Eden can beat 1, 2 or even 3 men on the ball.  Yes, he is great at drawing defenders out of their positions.  Yes, he is unselfish and has no problem passing the ball in scoring positions.  However, as a focal point of our attack and the most talented player on our team, he just doesn't have that mindset of NEEDING to score, that carnal animalistic desire to thrash the ball into the back of the net.  His finishing just isn't where it needs to be in order to be considered in the top handful of players on the planet.

I feel recently we have had games where Costa hasn't been at his best and I look around and there just isn't that player that wants to shoot first and pass second.  Willian certainly isn't that player and (in my opinion) Hazard isn't either.  So with Costa marked out of the game, we just pass and pass and pass when sometimes, we need to just pass and shoot.  

This is where Schurrle provides us with another major threat to opposing defenses.  Defenders must worry that he is going to have a go and must make a decision to mark him tightly, thus opening up space for our other options, or to back off a bit and allow him to have a strike on goal.  

I think a bit of selfishness is good for a team that has so many pass first players because at the end of the day, SOMEBODY has to put the ball in the net.  Schurrle is definitely from a different mold than Willian, but as I said to begin with, outside of Costa, he is our only aggressive attacking option with a nose for goal.

I am not a professional analyst (obviously) so let the downvotes and criticisms begin.

2) Not much doubt about that being Charlie Austin, I don't think? Dunne has been outstanding as well for us. Vargas has really settled. We're a different team with Barton on the pitch, I feel. But I still think Charlie stands out.

3) Yun's been great. He's really solved the left-back woes we've had for so long. Can get forwards when needed but he's not one of those fullbacks who are basically more adapted to LM than LB. He does his defensive duties well.

4) We're a completely different team away from home, as you probably already know. Having Charlie suspended was a huge blow for us as well. With both him and Zamora out, our attack was basically brand new, which I think explains the cluelessness.

Eeer, no. When did this last happen? NATS had problems with their phones last year, but incidents involving this particular system are vanishingly rare. Why? Because the software was coded and tested to the highest standards of compliance, and has then had decades of real-world usage and refinement.

You think you're going to get a better system with new from-scratch code?

The engineers actually recovered the system in time (under 8 minutes). Unfortunately they then suffered a network problem (with the wizzy new ethernet that was installed just 2 years ago to replace the old token-ring network) which prevented the data being delivered to controllers, so they had to fall back to contingency plans the same as if the mainframe hadn't been recovered.

The old system has gone decades without major issue. The new network has gone two years. Which is better - tried and trusted or new and sparkly?

false,HannibalAntePortas,null,null,"Capoue on his day is a very solid CDM and without question he has a role here. My only concern with him really is the same issue that he had at Toulouse. He has a tendency at times to turn off his brain and lose focus. When he's on, he's an excellent destroyer who offers good long-ball distribution. When he's off, he's turning his head and watching the ball rather than track the runner or he allows himself to get turned. He's best when he's partnered with a an engine/distributor. The engine takes on a good deal of the dogging of the opposition and helps Capoue press. What it also does is preserve Capoue from expending all of his energy. Having a combo of an engine and a distributor also frees up the weight placed on Capoue to be the main distributor in the transitional phase of play. Capoue is a good distributor, but he is not a string puller and he struggles when he's given the veritable keys to the car when it comes to the transitional phase. With a partner like Mason or Bentaleb he is freed up a bit more while the opposition targets their distributor role. That then allows him to play to one of his strengths of having time to look up and pick out a long ball. Stambouli could be a decent pair with Capoue, but that's more of a parking the bus type pairing which isn't what a positive looking side hopes to do. If he can keep his focus and is paired with the right partner, Capoue can thrive for us.

false,nowonmai666,lfc99,null,"&gt; Do people on here actually think that Lallana, Lovren, Markovic, Moreno, Can etc. are bad signings?

We **urgently** needed to sign players to (a) replace Suarez (b) provide cover for Sturridge (c) Generally increase squad depth to allow for the increase in the number of games and provide options off the bench for the manager when games aren't going well.

Young players with potential are always welcome, but not at the expense of players that are needed right now.

It's my opinion that the problems with our defence are tactical and coaching, not to do with the ability of our players, but if Agger was being bombed out he needed replacing.

Some will argue we needed an accomplished defensive midfielder, but we have Lucas and were doing fine without one in our diamond last season.

Lallana and Moreno were good signings towards objective (c). Markovic and Can are more for the future, but also count there.

Lovren was a terrible signing: he was an excellent defender in a system where he had defensive midfielders in front of him. He would have done well in Rafa's 4-2-3-1 with Mascherano and Alonso in front of him. He is completely at sea with the kind of tactics we have, and most certainly is not an upgrade on Agger. If we change the way we play Lovren might become a good signing, but assuming that we won't, he isn't.

That leaves us with (a) no replacement for Suarez and (b) no cover for Sturridge. As far as I'm concerned that's two thirds of the transfer committee's job just completely not addressed. They failed, and as a result we've gone from a team that topped the table at Christmas and played thrilling and ruthless attacking football, to a team that might well be in the bottom half at Christmas with a negative goal difference.",0,1418778766,null,0,false,0,cmx4yz2,t3_2ph3zf,t1_cmx4yz2,t1_cmwmsd9,null,1425362595,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

Best: ""Blink"" for it's ability to create such terror out of things so ordinary. ""The Impossible Planet/Satan's Pit"" for showing the Doctor in all him many faces. His love, his compassion, the terrifying wrath of his anger, his resolution for what he believes to be the greater good.

Worst: ""The Idiots Lantern"" and ""The Girl Who Waited"" (both for different reasons)

Most thought-provoking: ""The Girl in the Fireplace"" for letting us play both the weary traveler and the time-traveling Doctor. We hop through time experiencing Reinette at different points in her life as the Doctor does every day. Yet also feel the impatience of having to wait for the something amazing.

Most Intense: ""Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead""; River Song- need I say more

Most Entertaining: ""The Lodger"" for it's silliness

The Most Feels: ""Doomsday""

River met the first nine incarnations that went by ""the Doctor"", but erased his memories of her with mnemosine recall-wipe vapour to avoid corrupting his timeline. Her opinions on the Doctors were varied:

First Doctor - She considered this incarnation to be boring, because he spent his time hanging out with teachers.

Second Doctor - This was the incarnation that she held the most animosity toward, after he offered to show her ""this cool place on Telos"". She angrily wrote, ""I saw right through that (and I hope he chokes on that recorder).""

Third Doctor - This was one of her favourite incarnations, with her remarking they had ""a lot to talk about"".

Fourth Doctor - She discovered that he held a passion for scarves, having a whole room of the TARDIS dedicated to his collection.

Fifth Doctor - She noticed his obsession with the Eye of Orion, which she was misled to believe was a nightclub.

Sixth Doctor - She did not like this incarnation as much, considering his abrasive personality and appearance to be like a clown put through a woodchipper.

Seventh Doctor - She found him ""surpisingly Scottish"".

Eighth Doctor - River loved the very elegant and cultured style of the TARDIS console room that he used.

Ninth Doctor - She accidentally set him off after mentioning the Time War and learned very quickly it was a bad idea to discuss it at all.",0,1418781496,null,0,false,0,cmx6bmi,t3_2pgq0p,t1_cmx6bmi,t1_cmwvje7,null,1425361964,1,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,1

false,CollateralNerdage,null,null,"I know that life for kids with ASD can be really hard. Being a parent of a child who has ASD is harder still. Most parents want their kids to have the best childhood possible; many parents with children with ASD had normal childhoods with a lot of friends, and want that for their children too; when that's not possible, it can leave a heavy weight on their shoulders. The one thing to remember is that it gets easier and it gets better.

Let me share a bit of my story. I'm 19 and from small-town Wisconsin. I had such serious issues dealing with other kids growing up that before I went into high school, I was screened for ASD (specifically Aspergers, amongst other 'flavors') many times. In fact, a doctor diagnosed me with it and the diagnosis was only overturned when we got a second/third opinion. But I digress.

When I was in elementary/middle school, my best friend was a kid named Jimmy (name changed, obviously). He had extremely severe ASD and would rarely speak or do anything he was not comfortable with, but I liked him all the same. We played with Legos, watched Star Wars movies, played video games (he got me into Pokemon...good times) and played pretend games on the playground. We didn't have a huge circle of friends, but we were close. My first sleepover was at Jimmy's house; I saw my first James Bond movie at Jimmy's house; I got him and his younger brother, Wilson (name also changed)- who I became excellent friends with as well, to join Cub Scouts when my mom became den leader- later, I got them to join my Boy Scout troop with me, and their dad became Scoutmaster. (both of them got Eagle, by the way, as did I) I learned to like jalapeno poppers with their family, I learned how to lightsaber duel, and got into Star Trek because of them. We had good times, and in good times as well as in the worst times he was there for me.

Sure, there were bad times too. Jimmy had a few incidents where his ASD would show itself in a big way, but in general it wasn't something that stopped us from being friends. I didn't judge him, and he didn't judge me. Jimmy and I, though, would sometimes fight. I was so bad at social skills when I was younger that sometimes, I would be loud, obnoxious and selfish- even a bully sometimes. I didn't see other kids as people and I didn't treat them as such. (I feel bad, looking back at those days. I carried that reputation into high school and it took me until senior year to shake it.) But no matter what, Jimmy (and Wilson too) stuck by my side and stayed my friend, and they let me know when I was being a jackass. There were more than one time where I was being a dick to Jimmy and he would put me in my place. Jimmy was as smart as I was, perhaps even more so, and dealing with him and his brother actually taught me the social skills that I pride myself on now.

Sure, in high school, my social skills actually caught up, and I did okay for myself. Jimmy and I went our separate ways, and we didn't hang out anymore or spend time together. But I'll be forever grateful to him for being my friend, and being there for me when no one else was and the worst moments of my life were causing me to feel like there was nothing left. He's doing well for himself. He made friends who accepted him in high school and is now off at college, where I'm told he's doing amazingly (honors program at a college known for biology, and belongs to a ton of clubs). 

No matter what, your son is going to do just fine. Even though there'll be moments like this that will irk him, there will be friends who will accept him and care for him. Elementary, middle and high school are tough enough...and your son (to steal a quote from a YouTuber I like to watch) is playing the game of life on the hardest difficulty.

A narrative, a cannon that the audience can keep hold of. The Doctor is a space traveling Time-Lord who can regenerate, he travels in his TARDIS, he can change history until he can't because of the laws of space and time. The rules can be bended but not broken. What Moffat tends to do is create a problem and then make it better using something completely new and altogether ridiculous. Why did River and the Doctor need to get married to save the universe...because they did. Why can we reboot the universe... because we can.

He had a great first six months and he is undoubtedly a world-class shot stopper but every time a cross comes in I'm expecting him to bobble it or get out-muscled on a corner, etc. Agger I thought was treated particularly unfairly by Rodgers, I remember last year he got taken off in like the 70th min. at a game near the end of the season and Rodgers was asked why he took him off, Rodgers said something like ""Agger's just not physical enough,"" that's something you say in the locker room not to the press.

I've not removed the post because we respect other people's opinions and in the hopes that it might produce some discussion. Having said that, 12+ comments in and I've not seen any so don't be too surprised if another mod removes it for trolling (I've not approved it).

Since you're the OP of the conversation, and in the effort to get something actually going, you need to actually bring discussion to the table first BEFORE you demand other people to come racing to defend the show. Things like why specifically do you hate it? Where are you up to? What have you seen? Because almost all of us has complained about the show with those points at some point in its history. Most of us hate the SFX in series 1. Some of us hate the acting of Smith. Other's hate the acting of Tennant Eccleston. The entire thing is subjective and if you don't like a show, that's fine. Just don't bitch and moan about it or try to be *forced* into liking it. Just move on.

On the note of subjectivity, this statement is objectively wrong:

Or a more abstract self-jab by Moffatt at fucking up the numbering. I loved the War Doctor concept, but I feel half the reason Moffatt did it was so he could nudge himself into a position to be the one to give the Doctor more regenerations.

And he **still** fucked it up: Smith regenerating into Capaldi would have made Capaldi the final incarnation, post-regeneration 12, meta-Tennant as a duplicate of the same incarnation in my reasoning.

I don't insist on a lot of devotion to original series canon (that'd be a meta-crisis for you by itself), but that alone contradicts a lot of established facts about the regenration cycle.

Better IMO to have made John Hurt an 8th Doctor who'd been sucked into the Time War and had to fight for decades or centuries.

The details of the package being moved were never all that clear, and the age-progression photo we saw was shockingly similar to that of the Russian boy Tony found. It's him. 

So, in that, I'm kinda happy with the end as it concludes somewhat more hopeful than one might view on the surface. At least for Ollie. For Tony however, he lost everything and never could let go. Even with the realization at the end, he was still left with nothing. Like Julian's warning, it really did destroy him.

That really depends on how you define working. I don't think the Westminster Parliamentary system worked or works for people in Scotland and I don't think it works for people anywhere else either. It's undemocratic, out of touch, and dominated by the South East. Transport spending in London is £2,700 per person, in the North-East it's £5 per person. EVEL wouldn't help this, creating an English Parliament wouldn't solve this, creating an assembly in the North-East would solve it. But the people in the north-east rejected devolution.

That still doesn't make it a bad show, though, and a lot of those classic era episodes still hold up despite the low budget and iffy monster design.

If it's the modern series, 2005 to date, then it really depends on where you jumped in. You should really go back to the first episode of the first new series and start from there. Especially since the re-boot, plot points in one episode may be referenced a series or two later, and some of the arcs develop over the long term, so it's really a show you need to see all of, or it won't make sense.

Her mother had rushed her there so she wouldn't miss it. They were so nice about it and kept me company. 

I don't quite know why no one else showed up. I was always invited to other parties and had lots of fun. Could have been that my dad was a policeman and we lived in a police house maybe?

Hello, my name is Bluey, and I've watched Doctor Who since forever.  I literally grew up with the show and formed an attachment to it.  I'll watch every episode I can, and yes I do own a little merchandise as well.  
But I am not a fan.  I dislike the word.  It gives a negative connotation - at least, to me.  It implies an obsessiveness, an unwillingness to be drawn away from ones point of view, and an unhealthy focus on something.  The origin of the word - fanatic - speaks volumes.  I like the show.  I like the show a lot.  I'll happily talk about it with people, spend time writing bad fanfiction when the muse abuses me, and feel happy when I can watch.  I've also rewatched almost every episode made multiple times.  
I tell you these things not to show ""how big a fan"" I am, but to give you a background for my opinion.  

Beware: Similes, metaphors, terrible comparisons ahead:  
Doctor Who, to me, is a second hand book store in a side street away from the tourist shops with their flash and bang.  From the outside, it doesn't look like much, but I think ""Hmmm.  Maybe...I'll just take a look inside.""  Because you never know what you'll find, right?  
So you go inside, and...well, it's *charming*, to put it nicely.  The place is a little dim and dark, the books are organized in interesting and otherworldly filing systems known only to the Select Few, the place is a maze of shelves and stacks and piles and the air is filled with the smell of old paper, bindings, and just a hint of cat.  
Stairs lead to little rooms and alcoves filled with more books, each a miniature universe all of its own, just awaiting someone - you! - to open the cover and sink into it.  There are comfortable, worn old chairs here and there.  Maybe there's even a free tea (or coffee) urn with some homemade biscuits (cookies) that may or may not be safe to eat or will do interesting things to your digestion.  
The place is...comfortable.  Safe.  There are others here - never too many, and never really loud and flashy.  People like you.  People who love books, love the universes they can pick up and take with them out the door and to escape their normal lives.  

The decor of the store (special effects) will never be first class.  The owner/clerk will always be a little odd (acting).  They talk their own language (show jargon) but as long as you aren't openly hostile, they welcome you with open arms and let you be a part of the living, breathing thing that is this pokey, ramshackle and well loved store (show).  

Doctor Who knows it is not AAA Hollywood.  It knows it's relatively low budget, campy, cheesy and *it wholeheartedly and joyfully embraces that*.  It has its serious moments, to be sure, but it doesn't take itself seriously.  It sees its own faults, and pokes at them with a spork.  It's charming.  

Each episode is a book, each book is a universe, and each universe is potential for imagination and comfort and a feeling of home.  

To me, this is Doctor Who.

Well, I think I'll repeat what I've already said mainly. Not everyone likes every show so don't feel there's something wrong with either the show or yourself if you don't like it. 

A lot of the time when these questions come up, we ask you what shows you like already. There's always a link that can be found somewhere and that's how a lot of people come in to watch the show, just like any other really. You like Arrow/Flash? Both have heroes. You like Community? Both have the feeling of a close group and are quite amusing. You like Game of Thrones? Both have some huge crazy impossible shit happening.

My personal reason for my obsession is a little different. I got into the show several years ago when I was going through a really tough time and suffering from severe depression. It brightened up my world by teaching me that it isn't always this dark place and there are good people out there. That managed to prevent me from committing suicide. I wouldn't still be here if that show never existed, even if I got out with an unhealthy obsession for it.

But anyway, the problem with the show is that it is incredibly hard to get some people into it. While I disagree that the acting was very subpar (but then, that does depend on the episodes. Most are great but [some.....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4tYcP-0KsY)), the show has always had a ridiculously low budget, causing some very varying special effects, yes. Talk about ups and downs but you can never really expect top-notch ones. Most of the downsides here, with both SFX and the cringeworthy moments, are in the first few episodes, making it difficult 

Instead, the draws of the show is the not-so-serious look on the scifi genre, how it focuses on having fun and making the universe a better place. How it can go anywhere and anywhen and how it changes almost every episode. How it's completely unique in what it does. It's not there to persevere through or break down in tears while watching (though that can happen). It's there to have fun, even when taking a dark side. Yes, it can be scary as shit at times too. The show always changes. Always something new. A show that's been running for 51 years has got to have been doing something, right? But in that history, it's had a lot of themes for the show from an education show designed to teach children to a fairy-tale-esque to a rather dark take as shown in the series just gone.

Most of that is neatly summed up [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0pqunoUZzA).

Sadly, despite saying that....I still can't really put into words why I watch the show so much in an objective manor. Why I've seen over 800 episodes from the show's history and its' spinoffs and why I'm listening to Big Finish's collection too. Can't explain. It really is a subjective show that is on it's heart. There are numerous quotes that kinda go with this. Some examples:

&gt;Craig Ferguson: It's all about the triumph of intellect and romance over brute force and cynicism.

&gt;Steven Moffat: A lot of our heroes depress me. But you know, when they made this particular hero, they didn't give him a gun, they gave him a screwdriver to fix things. They didn't give him a tank or a warship or an X-wing fighter, they gave him a call box from which you can call for help. And they didn't give him a superpower or pointy ears or a heat ray...they gave him two hearts. And that's an extraordinary thing. There will never come a time when we don't need a hero like the Doctor.

&gt;Steven Spielberg: The world would be a poorer place without Doctor Who.

And then there's some quotes from within the show too. Two examples:

&gt;The Doctor: There are some corners of the universe which have bred the most terrible things. Things which act against everything we believe in. They must be fought.

&gt;The Doctor: Great men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame. Whatever the cost.

Shot power, dribbling ability, passing, touch, flicks, speed, size, acrobatics, heading. 

Shot power is amazing. Reminds me of Risse or vintage Gerrard. 

Gerrard is probably the only one better at long passes. Henderson and coutihnho are a bit more consistent with the midrange passes but Gerrard and Balo make cross field passes on the ground that don't look like they should be possible. 

His touch and control are unparalleled. Watching bring down balls above his waist with his feet and chest (both inside and outside the box) reminds me of Suarez. Lambert can't compare. He's the only person on the team who could have scored that goal against Ludo.

Dribbling is great for a guy his size, Lallana, Sterling and Coutinho are the only ones who have a shout at being better. They also tend to be a bit more conservative which Balo should learn from.

He's not afraid to whip out a scissor kick or a bike, and they usually turn into a damn good attempt. I don't recall anyone else on the team even trying those moves besides Suarez and Coates.

Great at free kicks, great at PKs.

I don't think he's the best player on the team, talent isn't everything. He needs to work smarter, work harder and stay more focused. But he's only 24. 

As far as who I think the best player is I would probably go with Sterling, Gerrard, Henderson, Lallana, Lucas (even with his broken knees) and then either one of the (lol) defenders  or Balotelli. 

Sturridge would be in the top 3 but he doesn't do us a ton of good while injured.

Contributors is tough this year as everyone has been pretty poor at least a decent chunk of the time.  That said, for this season I'd probably say Lucas (based on the limited time he has played in which he's been excellent), probably Lallana who isn't played enough for me, and then Henderson (who hasn't been near as excellent as last year, but is still 2nd in both goals and assists I believe).

EDIT:  Thinking about this a bit more and here's the issue I have with Balotelli- I just don't think he particularly cares much for the game.  I think he's an excellent natural athlete and for whatever probably obvious reasons played football, but I don't get the impression he's the kind of person who particularly loves the actual game.  I can see someone like Henderson, as a corollary, literally still sleeping with his football every night, but Balotelli I think would actually be happier working at a dog shelter or a veterinarian clinic or something entirely different.  He's got a ton of potential sure, but he's just never really made the effort to improve himself and, for me, I don't think he's improved at all since he first went to City.  The same flaws still exist in his game and he just doesn't seem to care much, which is why I think previous managers get so frustrated with him.  If you could bottle Flanagan or Henderson's passion for the game and inject it into Balotelli, I have no doubt he could be a world class player, but without that willingness to learn or expand his natural abilities further, I think he's just going to limp along from club to club and I don't see the requisite desire in him to change that from happening, sadly.  I have no problems with him as a person at all, as he seems like a decent, albeit oddly enough, perhaps somewhat shy individual but I just don't think he's a team player or the right sort of personality type to fit into a team sport.",0,1418796808,null,0,1418798246,0,cmxdaj3,t3_2phjdj,t1_cmxdaj3,t1_cmxcpbl,null,1425358634,2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,2

I don't have any particular love for BR. If he was sacked and a new manager was brought in I would support that man too. It's just ridiculous watching your own ""supporters"" turn on a man that made them believe in the dream just six months ago. 

If you thought this season was gonna be all rosy I'm afraid you're the one with tinted glasses, the ones who had realistic expectations are disappointed of course but not to the point of asking for the head of a manager that took us from 8th to 2nd and had us playing the best football I've seen in 20-odd years of supporting this club.

false,[deleted],null,null,"Let's see, Balotelli has 3 Serie A titles, 1 Champions league title, 1 Premier League title, and a bunch of random cup titles.  How old is he again?  How about his form when he joined AC Milan?  His performances for Italy, including in the 2012 Euro Cup?  

What you need to do is actually support him.  So many times I see people saying Balotelli is shit when the team leaves him to do everything himself, or gives him no service, or support, etc...  He's Liverpool's best player nearly every time he plays, but he's not Jesus, he can't produce miracles.  

How many goals does Lambert have?  Or Lallana?  Sterling?  How many has Gerrard scored from open play?  Answer for all of them, not many.  In fact, last I checked, Sterling is the only one with more goals from open play, and he has 3 (vs 2), after playing every single game.  Can't blame Balotelli for that.  

Maybe Rodgers should have looked at how Balotelli has been successful at the other clubs he's been at.  Balotelli is magical with the ball at his feet, but so often with Liverpool, he's either chasing shit crosses or trying to hold up the ball with no one coming to support him.  

If he leaves, the season is over.  Lambert, Lallana, Sterling, etc..., haven't proven they're any better.  

If Rodgers can integrate him in a way that he has a chance to succeed, then maybe Liverpool can have a chance to play in Europe next year.

And if you want an answer to what I personally like about the show, it has to do with the fact that my father was English and used to tell me old Doctor who episodes as bed time stories. Now a days I'm a physicist and I love the show for the unashamed love of the universe and the spirit of inquiry that runs through it. It is cheesy and ridiculous and it doesn't care, cheesy and ridiculous can be fun. When the Doctor meets a bug eyed monster he doesn't shriek and reach for a gun, he stops and says ""how interesting"" and tries to learn from it. 

It is not a work of art like Breaking Bad or The Wire, but I think it's core message of childlike curiosity and playfulness is one that the world needs for balance if nothing else. It is more like a beloved sports team. You can love your team and tune in to root for then every time, but you know they won't win them all.
