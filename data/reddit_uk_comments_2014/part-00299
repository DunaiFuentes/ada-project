If Labour, or the Lib Dems, or the Conservatives came out with a list like this, essentially saying they'll make Britain Great again with a handful of easy, common sense steps, many would complain they are being completely unreasonable. For one, most of the list is based upon assumptions (assuming we'll get trade agreements better than our current ones, assuming the EU costs us billions net that we don't get back) or pandering towards this patriotic common-sense dynamic creeping further into politics, and for two it goes against what the party have said in the recent past. 

It seems people are very quick to forget that UKIP, right up until the European elections, still supported a flat tax rate and still had many high ranking MEPs who supported privatisation of public assets like the NHS. 

In the space of 6 months, with no major changes either within the party (big MEPs before the European elections are still in power, same leader and deputy leader) or with the donors, UKIP have gone from essentially being the British GOP to being purportedly being supporters of the NHS and non-flat-taxes, moving more towards being like the Tories. Do people really believe a party's policies can change so much in such a short space and time, and still take that party at face value?

UKIP, at least in their policies, support the idea of skilled migration, not the idea of Britain's only. They support the idea that if someone is good enough to work in this country, they should be allowed the chance to work here. 

However, by allowing companies to discriminate by Britishness, they are undermining that concept. They are essentially making non-Britains legally working in the UK second class citizens, open to discrimination from their workplace because of that nationality. **No** political party should be endorsing any sort of discrimination against people who are legally in the country.

So, strong points and weak points of your argument:

* Strongest point: the connection to the Cybermen through the technology power + brain creativity link. I hadn't heard this before, but I think it really will happen. That picture you paint of humans and robots being combined to make a ""superior"" or ""ultimate"" race ... It seems exactly like something I'd expect from the show. This is your best prediction by far, and I look forward for the finale so we can find out how accurate it is.

* Weakest point: unfortunately, the Rani connection. As much as I would ***love*** for this to be true, [Big Finish is writing stories for the Rani right now.](http://www.bigfinish.com/news/v/the-new-rani) Since they have to get everything cleared by Moffat, that seems to be a clear indicator that he doesn't plan on using her again any time soon. But, even if Missy is just ... Missy, much of your guess is still good.

* Another very strong point: Why she's waiting until the moment of death to pick up people. Perfect argument about wanting to evade the Doctor's sleuthery. There also seems to be some element of sacrifice involved: All the people we've seen in Heaven thus far have died as a result of the Doctor's actions, directly or indirectly, and Missy seems to think the Doctor is her boyfriend - maybe, if not the Rani, she represents Death (the Eternal), or maybe Death's Champion? Death is the Doctor's constant companion, after all. Though that seems a little far-reaching for NuWho ...

I'm a 'new' (3rd season now) Baggies fan from Canada, so I know the feeling of coming to the team from abroad. What you need to know is:

- The fanbase is not busy on Reddit. They're much more active on their local forums and Twitter, if you want to get into the conversation. We're building it here (show up for Saturday game threads if you can get up for 10AM EST!), but it'll take some good seasons I think.

- If you come along far enough to want equipment, don't look in sports stores, even specialty ones, in North America. Don't even look in general sports stores in Europe, or most of England. You get West Brom kit, from the West Brom store (which is online, thankfully), and not much else. A couple of other chain stores do carry it online, but at that point, why not go with the source and cut out the middleman?

- We're smart! If anyone state-side asks you why on earth you picked us, one of the more fun reasons is that Baggies fans scored the highest on the BBC show Test the Nation, with a 136 IQ.

After reading a few of the reddit posts, I came to the conclusion that many people on the internet HATE disorganization + grammar errors. Therefore, (strictly out of fear) I decided I wasn't going to post a wall of text unless it was somewhat clean for the viewers.. it's very relieving to hear that from you. :) 

..Okay, back to the Doctor Who Discussion. 

-	**Weakest point:** This is a excellent point as to how Missy could not be the Rani. Great deductive reasoning; very logical, and I'm quite disappointed in myself for not researching that far! Alas, because it is my theory, I am forced to disagree with you and try to construct some sort of arguement.. &lt;Tl; Dr: Just skip to the bold.. Sorry for my great walls of text. x.x&gt;

- Now for some of the other readers who didn't get the chance, the article was about how the Rani was to be fatured in the new audio show, ""The Rani Elite"". As we all know (or through a quick wiki search), all ""official"" spin-offs are required to be approved by the BBC powerhouse. The Rani Elite, being an official spin-off, required to be approved by BBC; which  it was. Therefore, we can conclude that the use of the Rani character was ""okayed"" by Moffat and can further deduce that that meant he wasn't going to touch the character, the Rani. 

- **Now my argument points.** It is true that BBC granted sanction to the use of the Rani, but let's not forget that the Rani used in ""The Rani Elite"" is in a different time period as our Missy. As a synopsis of the show states, ""She will be reunited with the **Sixth** Doctor and Peri, in a story set written by Justin Richards and set in a galactic university."" If she is only to be featured with our Sixth Doctor, and not our twelfth, then we can safely assume (and pray) that she can = Missy~! 

- Furthermore, let's take a look at the release date of the show. -December 2014- Now im not jumping to any conclusions, but if I were the Doctor Who Marketing Team, (and if Missy really did = The Rani) wouldn't it be logical to release a ""the Rani"" audio show RIGHT AFTER the season finale while the Rani is still freshly HOT in the minds of New Whovians?? 

- Furtherfurthermore, (though it isn't necessarily an argument point) how cool would Moffat be if he decided to dedicate the entire Season 8 denouement to the late Katie O Mara, who passed away on March 30. I understand that filming + script started back in 2013 long before then, **but I think it'd be neat if Moffat honored Katie by immortalizing her character in Doctor Who.** Also, after Kate had passed away, Kate's agent had contacted Justin stating, ""it had been Kate’s wish that we proceed with a new incarnation of the Rani."" (but,then again, that was directed toward the audio tape so... NVM SHUT UP.) 

**Let's face it, not everyone is going to get to watch the classic doctor who, therefore all those great characters that existed back then would be lost.. forever. I'm going to give Moffat the benefit of the doubt, and assume he is brushing off some of that collected dust on these characters as he works toward a ""proper"" Doctor Who Reboot. :)** /end  #hope",0,1412824319,null,0,1412825291,0,cl4f8na,t3_2ipcyo,t1_cl4f8na,t1_cl4da1z,null,1426615854,5,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,5

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As some of you may know, Katie O' Mara, the actress who played the Rani in the Classic Doctor Who version, passed away on March 30th this year. And I'm not saying Moffat's reason for making Missy = Rani is because of Katie's passing, but what if Moffat had some epiphanic moment of all the great characters that would be forgotten by the Nu-Who generation after Classic Who passed away? Katie's passing solidified that.. 

**I think it'd be crazy-awesome if Moffat honored Katie by immortalizing her character in Doctor Who.** 


**Let's face it, not everyone is going to get to watch the classic doctor who, therefore all those great characters that existed back then would be lost.. forever. I'm going to give Moffat the benefit of the doubt, and assume he is brushing off some of that collected dust on these characters as he works toward a ""proper"" Doctor Who Reboot. :) #hope**",0,1412829317,null,0,1412829624,0,cl4haaf,t3_2ipe6s,t1_cl4haaf,t1_cl4gzy7,null,1426614828,2,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,2

The episode is still one of the most idiotic things you will ever see.

Look at the timeline: It takes you 10 years to get a mission up to the moon after things start going wrong. Why? The source of the problem is obvious. Why would you not send someone to solve it? (And why do you think ""100 nuclear bombs"" is going to somehow solve the problem?) And in order to get to the moon you don't use the technology that you clearly have to get there (since there was a Mexican mission already there). Instead, you pull a space shuttle out of a museum: A space shuttle that's been retired for three decades and *was never designed to go to the moon in the first place*.

Even the most basic production stuff is poorly done: I don't know who thought ""tires squealing on asphalt"" was the right sound effect for a space shuttle skidding to a stop on the moon, but they should be fired.

He doesn't say anything about this, he even accepts that there are lots of things that would need to be worked out. His only real argument is that this isn't completely fucking over local fans. You are correct that 1 game can be significant, but that isn't the ""issue"" that he is addressing with his comment.


&gt;Sure NFL seasons are relatively short but it's divided up into two conferences and divided even more with localized divisions. Then you got wild cards and playoffs, so all in all there's a decent amount of breathing room for most teams. One game seems way more trivial in that regard.

And the clubs in England just play league games? They don't play in multiple cups? Not to mention that merely living in England provides them with relatively easy access to multiple top level games, whereas in most places around the globe you will never see anything near PL quality. The team you support is one thing, the quality of football is another.

&gt;NBA, MLB, NHL have a crap ton of games so one game being played abroad can get a pass since there's a huge cushion for error.

There are also plenty of games played by PL clubs, even more if they are in EL/CL. The actual number past a certain point is irrelevant though, the number of times a distinct individual attends a game would probably change less and less for each additional game. That game is not being ""deleted"" or something, it would still be broadcasted and can be watched like millions of people do every weekend.

In essence, there are many problems with this, the only thing being said here by the other dude is that it does not gimp local fans.

Even down here in AUS hawthorn have agreed to play some of their home games down in Tasmania, and there are only 22 games in a season (with something like 40-50k average attendance) + a few games in the final. The only other competition is a knock-out tournament in the pre-season which is never taken seriously (not just by viewers, but the clubs themselves, its not uncommon for the club that wins it to do fuck all in the league). The point is that you are bringing benefit to a large group of people at a very low cost to others. I would love for this to happen in the PL but there are a number of issues that are unlikely to ever be overcome. The home advantage, the travel as you mentioned, dealing with the deluded english fans and other things is probably too much to get through.

&gt; (The Doctor) that hunted down criminals 

The Doctor doesn't go looking for trouble, trouble finds him. He's not a masked vigilante who travels the universe looking for villains to defeat, he's a traveller with a strong sense of justice and fairness who is drawn into trouble by others.

&gt; and other injustice things across time and space, what exactly would YOU do to stay hidden ‘til the end of time? 

Your question is based on faulty premises. If it were the Rani up to no good, she would be in far greater danger from local law enforcement than from the Doctor. Unless she has the cooperation of the local government, in which case so long they're just yet another in a long, long line of governments doing unethical things in the universe. History is big, the universe is big, and the Doctor doesn't go around trying to kill every single wanna-be Hitler.

&gt; Why what better camouflage is there than what is already normal? (That's right, I'm talking about death..) 

I'm afraid I have no idea what you think you are trying to say here.

&gt; The Doctor stated that evolution has produced perfect hunters, perfect defense, and the slight possibility of creating perfect hiding. 

The Doctor -- or rather, the people writing the Doctor's lines -- is simply wrong. That is foolishness to the extreme, and is not how evolution works. There is no perfection. It also fails the bloody common sense test: if there are perfect hunters which can catch any prey, and perfect defense which can defeat any hunter, what happens when one goes up against the other?

There are no irresistible forces, and no immovable objects. Any predictor can be defeated, and any prey can be caught.

Sometimes the writers come up with stupid concepts which are best dealt with by ignoring that they ever happened. So far, this season has been ripe with them.

But for the sake of the argument, let's suppose all the above is true...

&gt; What if Missy (The Rani), our favorite female, renegade timelord, finally perfected that art of disguise?

Yes, but what makes you think that it could only be the Rani?

Perhaps it's Madam Kovarian, or Romana turned evil, or former British Prime Minister Harriot Jones with her mind twisted from the Doctor turning against her, or the mother of that Red Shirt who was killed in that episode three years ago when the Doctor failed to save some guy, or a Dalek with a Chameleon Circuit, or the psychic projection from a dying alien on a lonely planet a million years ago...

To a Time Lord, regeneration might be scary because you never quite know if it will work or not. Maybe this time the damage is just too much and you will die, for real. But apart from the change of physical appearance, regeneration change is not much more of a big deal than going through menopause for humans. Or adolescence. The biggest difference is that it is over in a few minutes, maybe followed by a few hours or a day of instability, instead of multiple years for humans.

The infamous Romana regeneration scene where she repeatedly regenerates, going through four or five regenerations just on a whim, can't be taken as *completely* canon. Even the worst slave to fashion isn't going to burn through a third of her lifespan in a matter of minutes just to find a look she likes. We are forced into hand-waving that during the regeneration she was able to control the physical look, which the Doctor can't do because so far he's only regenerated due to extreme old age or physical trauma. Or some other hand-wave.

But Romana's regeneration is *conclusive* evidence that Time Lords don't consider regeneration to be death. Tennant's ""Everything I am dies"" *simply isn't consistent* with everything we've seen about Time Lords, including previous regenerations of the Doctor. He is being a whiny little bitch and the writers should be ashamed to have put those words into the Doctor's mouth. It is fake drama.

false,Rebelius,cnty-uk,Edinburgh,"My girlfriend is 21, and last November she hurt her knee while skiing. It just ""gave way"" under her and she went to her GP about it. They said it would most likely be fine, rest it and come back if it doesn't get better. The standard response of any GP.

At the beginning of April we were on holiday in Wales and went mountain biking for a day. She had to stop at lunchtime because her knee was giving her trouble again. After we got back to Edinburgh, she went to her GP again and they said you can walk okay and go about your normal daily routine, so we won't do anything.

She's 21, she doesn't want to ""be able to go about her normal daily routine"". She wants to be able to ski, climb, mountain bike, go running and who knows what else. She also happens to be German.

She was back in Germany in the summer, and went to her doctor there. They said said okay, we'll book an MRI. 10 days later, she has the MRI and then goes in the following week for the results. They told her she'd ruptured her ACL, only 5% of it was left, had a torn meniscus and required surgery. This happened the following week and now she's recovering from her surgery. For now she has to take everything easy, but she should end up with a ""normal"" knee.

The thing that worries me about her story isn't that it took 8 months for someone to actually do something. I understand that if she'd been treated by the NHS, from November, she may well not actually have had the surgery until summer anyway. It's the refusal of the NHS to actually run any kind of test unless they expect you have cancer. If I was in the same position and wanted someone to actually do something, I would have to either pay for an MRI privately or commit insurance fraud and go on holiday and pretend it happened there. Yes MRIs are expensive, but surely so is having people who can't run for more than 5 mins because of undiagnosed issues.",0,1412840948,null,0,false,0,cl4kc1i,t3_2ion0z,t1_cl4kc1i,t1_cl4jojt,null,1426613406,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

I think this is pretty fair, asking here is simple, free and quick. It doesn't also mean they can't later go and ask a professional.

I think people who get some amount like this are partly not looking for ""You should do X and Y"" but ""What the hell don't I know?"". There's a fear that there's something complex or important (taxes/costs/risks/etc) that applies to them but they have absolutely no idea what that thing might be. For example, I have no idea what happens if I inherit a house, maybe it's vital I sort some particular thing out with the land registry within 2 months or there's stamp duty or I need to get a solicitor to handle some particular thing that's typically expensive... 

Maybe what I'm trying to say badly is the question often feels more like ""What shouldn't I do?"" or ""What should I be wary of?"".

One thing that I only learned here is about independent financial advisors, it could be very easy and (in the long run expensive) to go to someone who isn't independent. 

Granted, all this information is findable pretty easily, although we'll never see the people who find the information for themselves as they don't post. That essentially exists as a filter to ensure we only ever really see people who can't/wont find the information they're after. There are some exceptions, but I think this represents the bulk of posts we see.

On a similar note, and a pet peeve, we also see loads of posts like this:

OP: ""I have a problem with X!""

SUB: ""Have you spoken to the people in charge of X?""

OP: ""No""

Not too relevant, but I always find it amazing that people don't simply talk to the relevant parties. Also people that expect detailed advice but provide absolutely no information (""I never have money, how can I fix that? *end of post*"")

UKIP is a perfect example. They are called ""far right"". Really? Well their main policy is to pull out of the world's largest free trade area. Free trade is ""right"", so doesn't that make them ""left""? Their big popular policy is to restrict immigration, in order to protect local workers from foreign competition. That's naked ""hard left"" protectionism. They think of themselves as ""libertarian"" (usually considered ""right""). Yet many of their policies are decidedly authoritarian: regulating people's clothing, sex lives, building more prisons!

false,[deleted],null,null,"I have a problem with articles like this. You cannot sum up the state of mental health care in the UK with 15 not very detailed anecdotes. I could easily find 15 people who have had a positive experience with mental health services but I suppose a more balanced article wouldn't make such interesting reading. My main concern is that articles like this give the impression that there is no point even trying to access mental health services. It's difficult enough for people in distress to seek help, reading something like this could well discourage people from going to their GP or taking up a referral to specialist services when they need it the most. Some of the issues faced by people in the article (unreasonably long waiting times for example) are a common problem within mental health services but some are very extreme. 

Yes, there are serious problems with mental health services in some parts of the country. These services are disgracefuly underfunded, understaffed and have a great deal of time taken up with non-mental health related social issues due to the knock-on effect of cuts to social care and police services.

Some teams and hospitals are underperforming, some are performing very well but we only hear about the failures and never the successes. 

Please don't think i'm condoning or trivialising any of the issues highlighted in the article. No one should have to wait 6 months for an appointment with a psychologist. No one should have to travel 300+ miles to visit their child in hospital because their are no beds in their area, these things are unacceptable and need to be addressed. However, these experiences are far from universal and I feel it's important (for the sake of balance and not discouraging vulnerable people from seeking help) to point out that while there will be individuals who have recieved an unsatisfactory response from services, there are still many people who ask for help and receive it in a timely fashion. We need ongoing commitment by the Government to provide mental health services with the funding and rescources necessary to ensure that these failures simply do not happen. It will take a long time and significant financial investment to restore the public confidence that has been lost.

Chances are that any new loan will be on new terms (at least, that is how it was when I worked as a mortgage underwriter), and would need to be with the same lender, as mortgage lenders won't entertain having a second charge.

For example; say your house is worth £100,000 and your loan is £110,000; you want to buy a house for £200,000 with a £150,000 loan.

Currently, the lender has less security than the outstanding loan. If you default, they most likely won't get all the lending back through repossession. Lenders do not like this.

In the new scenario, they have a good margin on loan-to-value, and £40,000 of the lending will be on current rates.

Sterling's been alright but his finishing under pressure has been sub-par. He makes great runs but can't always cap those off. Then there's Coutinho whose form has been disappointing. Lallana unfortunately had to fight his way back to fitness through one of our more demoralizing spells and Markovic hasn't really hit his stride.

We conceeded tons of goals last season too, this season we've struggled to find the same space to work with and Suarez had a lot to contribute to that.

The best overall image entered in this year's Army Photographic Competition, as chosen by the Army's Facebook fans, is this picture of an Army Air Corps Apache display team helicopter wowing the crowds at the Royal International Air Tattoo held at RAF Fairford earlier this year. The display uses pyrotechnics to simulate some of the firepower that the Apache helicopter uses and finishes with a grand finale fireball hover. [Picture: Corporal Jamie Peters RLC, Crown copyright]

Do you have a plan in place to make sure the debt isn't built up again? If you pay off the debt without balancing your budget you are asking for trouble. If we are talking just general spending, it's problematic.

Have you considered the potentially huge amount of interest that you are going to pay on your debt? £15,000 over 25 years will cost you ~£8,000 in interest - **half of the cost again**.

Lenders consider debt consolidation loans as being pretty high-risk, and it shouldn't be something entered into glibly. I would take a long hard look at the household budget and consider if there are any alternative methods of dealing with the issue.

When I was working in mortgages (5 years ago now) the bank I was at wouldn't allow equity-loans against the house above 75% loan-to-value. You are proposing a loan-to-value of ~80% (on an optimistic Zoopla estimate). The salary multiple isn't too bad but I would be asking questions about your ability to repay the extra borrowing depending on how the debts were built up in the first place.

Sorry if that has come across as particularly harsh. I spent a fair amount of time underwriting mortgages and saw a lot of applications where people were asking for lending for similar reasons, and there rarely seemed to be much thought put into alternatives.

Then as ever with this sort of thing there was plenty of 'reply-all' idiocy (as always happens when one of these misconfigured organisation-wide mailing lists is stumbled across e.g. last year at UCL on a department/school level, happened to McKinsey a couple of times etc).

It might seem cheap now but it almost certainly won't be over time.

In addition to that, the worst that can happen if you default on the credit cards is that debt collection agencies will harrass you. They could technically make you bankrupt but most likely you'd end up with years before that happened.

If you default on the (now larger) house loan, they repossess. 

Perhaps a more sensible route would be the snowball method. Move as much of the borrowing onto interest-free credit cards as possible ([info and guide on MSE](http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/credit-cards/balance-transfer-credit-cards)), and funnel all payments above the minimums to the most expensive debt first. Once that has been repaid, pay the next most expensive off, and so on.

This info also taken from their remortgage guide:

&gt; You want to borrow more.
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps your current lender has said no to lending you extra money or the terms it's offering aren’t very good. Remortgaging to a new lender might enable you to raise money cheaply on low rates. But remember to take all the fees into account to see if it really is cheaper than other forms of borrowing.
&gt; 
&gt; The new lender will ask you what the extra money is for. Surprisingly, it is likely to be more comfortable with you borrowing the money for a new car than for business purposes. Not so surprisingly, it won’t want to lend you money to start a new business….
&gt; 
&gt; The most commonly acceptable reasons to raise money are for home improvements and paying off other debts. Just be prepared for your lender to ask for evidence if you are borrowing a large amount, e.g. builder quotes or proof that you have paid off the debts.
&gt; 
&gt; Martin says...
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; I always shiver slightly when people talk about adding non-housing debts to their mortgage, whether it’s for a new kitchen, a holiday or to consolidate existing borrowing. There are times when this could be a necessary evil, perhaps to get you out of a hole.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; My problem isn’t that it is wrong per se, in fact often it’s a good move, but the issue is many people see it as a no-brainer solution.
&gt; &gt; 
&gt; &gt; Let me make something plain. Borrowing £1,000 at 5% over 20 years is more than twice as expensive as 10% over 5 years.

Other states and countries will quickly follow suit. A fully autonomous vehicle does not need to ''deal'' with all weather conditions to be implemented. But your basing such information off crappy reports from early 2012. 

What you must understand is that in the new paradigm car ownership is no longer necessary. A shared fleet vehicle can replace 10 personally owned vehicles. Which means that uptake could be very rapid. But as you highlight the average age of a car on UK roads is 7.5 years. Which means if every car built was autonomous by 2020 then by 2028 over half of cars on the roads would be autonomous based on current trends. 

There are no environmental reasons to consider. Autonomous vehicles are around 20% more efficient than the average human driver. In the new paradigm vehicles will be designed around journey needs and not be contingency plans. Which means shared fleets. Which means 2 seat small passenger cars that are electric. Which means purpose built courier vehicles. Small lightweight electric cars have already been show n to be the most energy efficient form of transportation. Having them be autonomous will make them even more so. ",0,1412853256,null,0,false,0,cl4mecn,t3_2ip87u,t1_cl4mecn,t1_cl4ma4z,null,1426612442,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I shared my hall with 11 others, and I was the ONLY one with a TV (indoor aerial got my all 4 analogue and some digital channels). I thought the others were crazy to go without and the uni was negligent not to at least provide aerials.

Actually I knew of one friend at in another hall who had a TV, but that was a shared one in a common room with bad picture. All my other uni friends had no TV at all.

As time went on, I spent more of my time watching TV and less going to lectures. And I ended up being invited to parties, clubs and soirees less. Not that I had time for socialising, as I was religiously watching 4 soaps every day, as well as about half a dozen other programmes.

I think I was the only one in my hall to eventually drop out after failing the 1st year and spent the next 3 years sitting in studio flats around Brighton mostly watching TV. Before I snapped out of it and got a life. And went out. And made new friends. And enjoyed my youth that I'd previously wasted.

I'm going to be brutally honest: If your most pressing question about coming to the UK to study is the TV service you might get in your halls, then you're coming for the wrong reasons.

Last time I went, there was a Primark, but it was one of those shitter Primarks, not the newer ones which have all the latest pieces in. It's full of discount rails and looks a dump constantly, the one at the shopping centre 10 minutes away actually looks like a high street shop. It's amazing how the same shop can vary so dramatically in such a short distance. I think there might also be  New Look and a Card Factory, both available at either the shopping centre or the retail park, i.e. places with free parking and more choice. There is absolutely no reason for us to pay a fiver to park in town anymore, because there's fuck all there. 

I used to love rummaging through all the charity shops, but half of them became 'clearance charity shops', which had stuff that wasn't even worth the quid they were selling it for. Some shut down as well, so there's fewer charity shops to look in. Plus as a lot of people have noticed, they've put the prices up and the stuff they sell ain't half as enticing as it used to be, second hand Primark for the same price as Primark, no ta. 

There's a few independent shops which seem to be doing okay, we have two collages so their customers tend to be kids passing through, but there's nothing there that you think 'oh, lets go to town and see what that little shop has to offer today', again not with the price of parking, not worth it. 

And finally, the bloody EDL march through every other weekend, which does absolutely fuck all for us. Footfall down 90% during marches, most places close because there's no customers except stupid violent thugs and they don't want to deal with them. Even the pubs close, bar one, who gets all the custom, but it's 'that rough pub that's known for violence', so everyone just lets them have 'em.

Right, but if people say 'spare', then assuming they've read the FAQ (which I still think should be stickied, incidentally), they know that is after standard budgetary considerations.

Also, I'd go back to the idea that bad 'advice' is also balanced by the fact most will use us as only a single resource out of many, not solely.

&gt; You don't get that protection on the t'internet, obviously.

Really, nobody posting here expects that. If you feel people need reminding, then perhaps stick it into the FAQ sticky.

Let's at least make some reasonably charitable assumptions here, and back that up with very visible, well linked content to ensure it is patently obvious in the case of naiveté.

There will be a tradeoff between possible return and risk. Over a year, almost everything with some risk might drop by (say) 50%. 

&gt; Should I keep it all in a pillowcase under the floorboards?

No.

&gt; Should I try to purchase shares?

Not individual ones, no. Possibly broad index funds but that's something we can work out later when you understand the risks.

&gt; Is there a company who I can contact to personally invest my money into a company where I can have an influence? 

No, not with £10k, it's nowhere near enough to invest in a company and have some control with any type of safety. Angel investors have many, many millions to invest.

There's no real answer here without knowing more about you. What's your emergency fund? Do you have any debts? What are your plans (when might you want access to this money)?

As for ups and downs, it sucks starting later while everyone else I know has graduated but I think it's been to my benefit to have started later - I've done my partying phase so I'm much more focussed on my work, I've got experience so I actually know what I want to do and having actually worked a job means I'm much better at what I'm doing and keeping to deadlines. There are definitely downsides - you're starting later so you have to deal with all your friends working and getting paid while you're still a student, three years is a long time to commit to studying and living off of student loans and it can be tough to get back into the mentality of being a student again.

Or, more recently, if we look at Papa Johns, who got a surge in profits when they openly came out against homosexuals (I think), because bigots flocked to them, and people apathetic to the issue didn't care.

Why do you think we now have double the number of people on minimum wages compared to 15 years ago, and why local authorities are increasingly more minimum wage employers?  Even the Labour party is now synonymous with zero hour contracts.

Even minimum wage in the UK, earning in pounds, means being able to send more money home if you're willing to temporarily put up with some hardships.  The young person with less experience has to put up with those hardships to compete.

If you can employ a more mature, more experienced person with  grounded family obligations to provide who is willing to work for the same or less because it means more once it is sent back to their family, then of course young people are going to be pushed out.

You can probably save if you ask around and get another Hammer to split the cost, I think there's a few planning to head up from Sydney and Melbourne.

The turnout varies a bit, really depends on the game. We normally get at least 20 to a random game (that we've made an event for). For the bigger games its upwards of 40-50. For the REALLY big games (Playoff final) we've packed the pub with over 400. 

At the moment this event has about 55 people confirmed, and we're still 6 weeks out so hoping to secure a few more from interstate. Those of us in BNE will more likely confirm a lot closer to the date.

1) Your claims that groundwater pollution is rife in the US is not borne out my facts. There have been isolated incidents of groundwater contamination, but the *VAST* majority of sites have not caused any issues. Where there has been contamination this has been due to lax regulation or regulation not being followed correctly, which is not a problem we will face in the UK as our regulations are much tighter and the penalties for not following them incredibly severe by comparison.

I will also point out for those confused about how groundwater contamination can occur, that contamination has almost never been proven to come from the well itself. In the rare cases that contamination has occurred, it was almost always caused by incorrect disposal of the waste water AFTER it comes back out of the well.

You make it sound like groundwater pollution due to fracking is inevitable, yet as /u/Benjamin-Disraeli points out we have been fracking for oil both onshore and offshore in the UK for three decades without groundwater contamination EVER occurring. There is nothing inherently unsafe about this practice.

2) Obviously we will not benefit directly via lower gas prices, because we don't subsidise our local market for gas/oil in this way. To do so is actually a really terrible idea, as it fosters businesses dependent on an artificially low gas price and leads to both businesses and consumers being less efficient in their usage than they otherwise would be. See the issues Ukraine is having currently for evidence of this - their economy has contracted 5% this year because of their reliance on artificially cheap gas from Russia.

However as with oil before it, establishing a gas fracking industry in the UK will achieve MANY benefits for the country: Tax receipts for the government will be many billions/year - money that can be spent on public services, or used to reduce taxes on the everyday consumer. It will give us greater leverage against our European neighbors, as we will become a major gas exporter. It will give us greater energy security in an increasingly uncertain world, ensuring the long term viability of various UK industries.

http://www.cuadrillaresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Chemical-Disclosure-PH-1.jpg

And you're nitpicking wording. Nobody will get a permit before the EA knows what's in the fracking fluid. The DECC won't allow any fracking to start before the EA and HSE gives to go ahead. 

https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/265988/Onshore_UK_oil_and_gas_exploration_England_Dec13_contents.pdf

Pg. 28 outlines what operators must disclose before the EA will grant a permit. This includes anything to do with groundwater which the EA will decide on a case by case basis. 

Pg. 46 says before the DECC will give permission to fracture (not drill but actually use a fracturing technique) they must disclose chemical additives for each well they use on a case-by-case basis. 

https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/185935/UKOOGShaleGasWellGuidelines.pdf

This document outlines in more detail what should be disclosed. 

Pg 29 section 9.2 states:

&gt;Operators will disclose
on
the
UKOOG website,
www.ukoog.org.uk
, the chemical
additives
of
fracturing fluids on a well-by-well basis.

&gt; Information for
fluid
disclosure should include:

&gt;• Any EA/SEPA authorisations for fluids and their status as hazardous/non-hazardous substances.

&gt;• Material Safety Data Sheets information.

&gt;•
Volumes of
fracturing fluid
, including proppant, base carrier fluid and chemical
additives.

&gt;•
The trade name of each additive and its general purpos e in the fracturing process.

&gt;•
Maximum concentrations
in percent by mass
of each chemical
additive

Happy they'll have to disclose?

So if the pilot still had computer control it would’ve been easier to steer away from populated areas than if not. That said I am very much guessing what was wrong in this instance and there’s a huge number of variables including the jet, airspeed, height, weather / wind speed… 

But yes I agree, trying to imply something could have happened but didn’t is just irrelevant in this instance. The plane came down relatively safely and nobody was injured. No big terror. No children killed or houses demolished from unsafe military action in the area.

Team scenario 1: 4-4-2 diamond, based on current form
GK: Migs
RB: GJ
LB: Moreno
CB: Skrtel
CB: SAHKO
CDM: Gerrard
LCM: Jordan Henderson
RCM: Joe Allen
CAM: lallana 
CF: sterling
ST: Sturridge

Bench: coutinho, lovren, manquillo, balo, can, suso and jones

balo and sturridge wouldn't play on top of each other but rather would be staggered and interchanging. I also like the idea of hendo playing a little higher, with allen doing the recycling work and gerrard ""quarterbacking"". in addition, I would personally encourage the full backs to push high and have gerrard fill that space, essentially making skrtel a cb/rb and sahko a cb/lb at times depending on which full back is getting up the field. if we want both full backs pushed forward, we can play a pseudo 3 in the back, but it depends on the opponent. against a madrid I would tend to favor the 3, especially at anfield. against chelsea (at the bridge?), I would probably park 2 buses and counter, only for the sole reason of beating mou at mou's game. Would love for that to happen and then for brendao to put in a cheeky comment taking a dig at mou or a ""look who's slipped up now"" kind of comment. 

Team scenario 2: 4-3-3 , second team

gk: migs
rb: manquillo
lb: enrique (although I love flanno)
cb: toure
cb: lovren
rcm: can
lcm: suso
cam: coutinho
lw: marko
st: balo
rw: borini

bench: rossiter, williams, skrtel, mclaughlin, rickie lambert, yesil, jones

We did support them. We gave them money and hooked them up with arms dealers. The US along with Jordan helped train them. 

We didn't fight their war for them as we did in Libya, we tried to but it was shot down by the UN and our domestic parliaments. Our ""inaction"" is not for a lack of trying. 

&gt; If you want to point fingers at ignoring Islamism

This has nothing to do with ""Islamism"" and it never has. It's an ethnic battle for political control of various regions. When we drew the borders of Iraq/Syria etc following WW1 we carefully did so to ensure that there were various groups vying for control of each state. Instead of a strong unified Kurdistan we turned them into a minority across three new states. This is a [classic British technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule), UK intelligence reports [literally described the process as](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein_Correspondence) ""If properly handled they would remain in a state of political mosaic, a tissue of small jealous principalities incapable of cohesion"". We ran all of the colonies this way. 

When we overthrew Saddam [we banned about 1/3rd of Iraqis from taking part in politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-Ba%27athification). The same people who now back or support ISIS as they are fighting a government that disenfranchised them. It's like as if China invaded the USA and banned the Republican party then the KKK show up and start fighting to get them back. People who normally would have nothing to do with the KKK now support their actions. It really is that simple. 

We knew exactly what would happen in this situation, it's one we've deliberately played out dozens of times. It suits us. Had they not been fighting each other they may have united and formed a genuine democratic state, one where the leadership put Iraqi needs ahead of ours. That simply will not do.

I can guarantee you that I've played and learned the tactics of the game at a higher level than you so unless you're a professional footballer and or manager you don't have a right to say that. 

First of all, Pirlo literally plays the same position Gerard does right now. He's a deep lying playmaker- not an attacking midfielder. Even when he played as an attacking midfielder, he did it in systems that didn't apply 2 strikers, where they instead packed the midfield or defence, giving Pirlo that cushion and leeway to go forward. 

Scholes' sides were also either 1 striker or supposed to be 2 striker set ups on paper, but Rooney dropping back again packed the midfield and gave Scholes that cushion. If you go back and actually watch game clips you'll realise that why Scholes was able to dominate games was because of constant off-the-ball movement from his midfield teammates as well as the striker up top. 

No, the problem isn't that he doesn't have the legs for attacking play, it's that he's being man marked and prevented from spreading the ball IN THIS POSITION. 

&gt;if he moves further upfield is now if he is man marked that frees others up

That literally isn't how it works. There's not a player that is just attached to Gerrard- there's a player in opposition systems (ex, downing, Agbonlahor, etc) that is tasked with harrying *whoever plays what Gerard is playing right now*. Moving Stevie forward isn't going to magically pull their forward all the way back to their half of the field- that's not how the game works. 

The only way we can slide Gerard upfield is if we drop the 2 striker system we had planned on using when Daniel became healthy. That is a huge waste of the possible link up that Balo and Daniel could eventually provide. Wasting a young, potentially lethal strike partnership just to feed your emotional need to see a 33 year old captain further up the pitch is why you wouldn't be a good manager either- what's best for the club comes first.

Nicotine on its own is about as dangerous as caffeine, and certainly less dangerous than alcohol or smoking. The 2 other primary ingredients are benign as long as a certain wattage is not exceeded. Flavourings are made from food grade ingredients that are all approved for human consumption. Whilst yes, not using them at all might be better than using them. Using Ecigarettes is well within commonly regarded acceptable risks, such as walking down a street next to heavy traffic.

&gt; I'm very wary that the e-cig companies will be looking to make their product popular with people who don't smoke, because that's where the money is

This I can agree with, they should not be promoted to non smokers. That said 0% nicotine varieties of fluids exists.

&gt; there are health problems with them, infact, due to the very small size of the particles you're inhaling they could be worse in some ways than cigarettes.

I am curious as to what health problems you are referring to that are substantiated? There is a percentage of the population with a sensitivity to some of the ingredients, but then they shouldn't be using them, in the same way that those with sensitivities to certain food products shouldn't be using them.

&gt; I particularly hate it when people use them inside, no one wants to breathe in your disgusting nicotine oil

In all fairness they should be used discreetly in public places, however users should not be excluded to ""smoking areas,"" many of us are ex smokers, and have won an extensive battle to get off of smoking. Forcing ecigarette and vaporiser users into smoking areas is placing them directly in contact with their previous addiction, much like forcing an alcoholic into a bar, or someone treating heroin addiction with diamorphine to hang around in with junkies. The phrase ""disgusting nicotine oil"" demonstrates a prejudice, what is so disgusting about it? The smell? Well you can't make sweeping statements about that, every flavour smells different, from tobaccos and menthol, through fruit flavours, deserts and a wide variety of different tastes. The vapour? Again, every device behaves differently, and it is also dependant on the exact mix of ingredients being used. A user could be using anything from a sub-ohm dripping atomisers on 100% vegetable glycerin and produce voluminous clouds of smoke, or be using a ""cigalike"" with an automatic battery and a cartomizer, generating less vapour than the average person breathing out on a cloudy day.

It has been said that ecigarettes and vaporiser represent the best opportunity we have had as a society so far to break the back of tobacco addiction and culture. They represent a viable, enjoyable alternative for addicts that minimises potential harm, both to the user and those around them. Why don't we encourage that rather than attempting to demonize the products and the users?",0,1412865630,null,0,false,1,cl4qetf,t3_2ir0ne,t1_cl4qetf,t1_cl4p24q,null,1426610426,12,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,12

That's very debatable. Whilst they might not be nicotine use cessation aids (though many, many people steadily drop the nicotine levels in their juice over time), they most certainly ARE smoking cessation products. Smoking is the inhalation of burning tobacco fumes. No tobacco is being burnt in the use of ecigarettes, therefore the user is not smoking. If ecigarettes are not a smoking cessation product, if an ecigarette user is still a smoker, than so is someone using a nicorette patch, or using an old style nicotine inhaler. In truth, ecigarettes have more in common with Asthma inhalers then they do anything else, there is even a visible exhalation of vapour. If ecigarette users are smokers, than so is an Asthmatic using their inhaler.

Property prices have been increasing and increasing though, in many areas.  This has been pulling rents up as landlords have been eager to reap the benefit (understandably) of what they understand to be the increased value of their property.  At the same time retail sales have until recently spent time in negative growth, and an increasing amount of those sales have been offline.  All of which is fair enough, but it has put shopkeepers in a bit of a pincer movement.

Now it sounds like one half of the pincer hasn't been so active in your area so it does make sense to conclude that what's been going on has varied by area.  Hopefully as landlords have found their units empty they have also reduced their rent until people are happy to pay.  I do know from a solicitor friend though that quite a few landlords have been slow to adjust to the new reality and have been waiting to get what their property is 'worth' while it sits empty.  But like you say this might well be regional, so no doubt the cause of this fall is down to a bunch of factors.

Running a shop was very very interesting.  From where to place things on a shelf ergonomically, to how the decor of the place alters peoples perceptions and buying behaviour, to how you to interact with people, to stock control, avoiding getting robbed... don't think I've learned nearly so much since!

false,JunglistMassive,,GLORIOUS RED SAUCE ARMY,"&gt; You are aware right that the original NICRA council, not the Wolfe Tone society who, yes you are correct, suggested it, but the actual council itself had 3 members of Queen's University Ulster Unionist Society. Young unionists at the time, some of whom I interviewed, were aware that one man one vote also applied to young protestants who were not allowed to vote and wanted an end to all housing discrimination in unionist areas and in Nationalist controlled areas such as Newry and Mourne. 

That's not being disputed, the hopes where that NICRA would be its own vehicle, Republicans actually suggested alternative organisational models (and arguably more democratic) rather than the centralised model finally adopted by NICRA, it has to be understood that in later development NICRA, the Republican movement was only one element of a wider collective. It of course enjoyed the support of a vast array of people across the board, who sought change in their society, this included Moderate Unionists. This was exactly the point the IRA knew that campaigning on their own in isolation was not going to change anything, this is precisely why a coalition like NICRA came to be.

&gt; There were many unionists who initially supported the NICRA but when they saw the OIRA hijacking the movement and rising violence, they had to move away from it.

This is a crass oversimplification of events, Firstly there was no OIRA at the time, the split had yet to take place. The IRA where intsrumental in the formation of the NICRA yet kept a decidedly hands off approach, that's hardly hijacking it.

You've failed to grasp that the IRA had tried an armed campaign four years previously, they gave it up of their own accord and sought a new direction, a peaceful one.

The early stages of NICRA where entirely ineffectual, and failed utterly to attract any kind of support, that would come at a later date. The reasons being that the NICRA was not a radical street movement but a letter writing campaign.

&gt; They underline the character of NICRA at this stage as an organisation which, like the NCCL, was concerned with the defence of legal and constitutional rights and the grievances of individuals, not with militant protest.
&gt; 
&gt; This phase was to last a year and a half and it was a period of general ineffectuality. As Fred Heatley described it:
&gt; 
&gt;   ""The first eighteen months was a time of frustration. William Craig, to whom most of our complaints were directed, usually delayed in replying. When he did he usually denied that the complaints were justified - even when a civil rights officer (myself) was physically thrown out of Hastings Street [RUC] Station! Yet we did detect an easing off in harassment of Republicans and of itinerants. But the most annoying aspect of the early period was the lack of real interest shown by our first council members - at times we couldn't muster up the required six members for a quorum at the monthly meetings. [14]
&gt; 
&gt; The work of documenting abuses, which had been begun by the CSJ, was continued and the association intervened on behalf of a group of travelling people who were camped on Belfast's Shore Road. But although in December a national opinion poll in Northern Ireland found that 43 per cent of those interviewed thought that there should be legislation to outlaw discrimination, NICRA seemed incapable of tapping the support of this large, sympathetic minority.""
&gt; 

It was the Peoples Democracy and not the IRA who sought to steer the movement towards street politics and into the inevitable confrontation with the state.

&gt; In December 1968 the People’s Democracy had debated the issue of marching to Derry over and over again. Many were opposed to such a march.  Captain O’Neill, the Prime Minister of the Stormont government had promised reform and better treatment for Catholics. **The Republican movement led by Sean Garland and Cathal Goulding were against the march**. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) opposed the march. John Hume, who was in  control of the Derry Citizens’ Action Committee, was against the march. So was Eddie McAteer, the veteran nationalist politician and brother of Hugh McAteer, a former Chief of Staff of the IRA.  Eddie told the press that “January is a bad month for marching.” Young Bernadette Devlin, who would later in the year become the icon  of  “Civil Rights” was opposed to the march. In the spirit of the times, Bernadette accepted the majority decision and turned up at the City Hall. ^[Source](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/crights/purdie.htm)

The NICRA was a broad movement that had Moderate Unionists, Anarchists, Socialists and Republicans, it held the hopes of many for a better and more just society. It was a the reaction of the state who sought to smash the movement. It brutalised and slaughtered a peaceful movement over very reasonable demands. The actions of the IRA Leadership are clear, they had tried a futile armed campaign previously, it had no support and they wound it up. Their actions subsequently were to campaign in a peaceable manner in a broadbased coalition for positive change. They had not forseen the disproportionate response that the state would mete out, the Republican movement split over how to deal with the actions of the state. At the time Catholic areas were daubed with the slogan ["" I R A= I RAN AWAY""](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oVaUkHKOyLAC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=%22I+R+A%3D+I+RAN+AWAY%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=L43qTZUV3f&amp;sig=sA0E69mRJSe9H169N1GTDoIZXAI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bJA2VPOoOMGa7gar84HoBw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%20R%20A%3D%20I%20RAN%20AWAY%22&amp;f=false), they where sneered at for their inaction. It was the demand from the Civil Rights generation that brought the PIRA to fruition, the Catholic population would no longer traipse home from a march beaten bruised and dejected while their friends and comrades lay in pools of blood in the street.

You have a simplistic and ultimately naive reading of history, which ultimately does yourself a disservice, if you fail to grasp the motivating forces behind the causes of violence, You have absolutely no chance of making sure history does not repeat itself. I fear that the small sub set of people whose opinion you have sampled from the time does not represent an accurate picture of the events. Those tumultous times have been re-interpreted, revisited and rehashed multiple times all in the service of revisionism; i.e to serve today's political agenda. There will of course be people involved in the NICRA who have vastly different opinions about the nature of the movement. There are those with their own agenda and that includes the current Sinn Fein, but to deny their involvement and more so their importance is an absolute absurdity.

One poster on here recently  spoke about his own dissertation and his difficulty in finding a balance of people to talk to with regards to the [Civil Rights Movement](http://www.reddit.com/r/northernireland/comments/2fij0v/dissertation_on_the_civil_rights_movement/), so he was casting his net wider. I have a feeling that you have only spoken to a particular sub set of those involved, with their own peculiar slant on what happened, what you have as a result is a skewed analysis and an incomplete set of data. 


**P.S With regards to my reading habits and the sources.

I provided four sources, two of which are wikipedia articles (in which you will find each article is carefully sourced) the other two are CAIN itself a reputable online resource on the history of the troubles (and of which the  particular referencesis to the book **Politics in the Streets:The origins of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland by Bob Purdie**) and the Irish Republican Marxist History Project, in which a Personal Recollection of Peter Cosgrove from Peoples Democracy is posted.

Jones, Manquillo, Skrtel, Toure, Flanagan, Lucas, Allen, Can, Markovic, Balotelli, Suso

Bench: Ward, Enrique, L. Jones, Rossiter, Borini, Lambert, Sinclair

##4 - vs Real Madrid (4-2-3-1) - 2 holding midfielders with a pacey counter-attack

Mignolet, Johnson, Skrtel, Lovren, Moreno, Lucas, Gerrard, Henderson, Lallana, Sterling, Sturridge

##5 - Start of Next Season (4-3-3 BR) - Wisdom and Ilori to fix the defence, Hendo and Allen as the midfield maestros, Sterling at no.10, few new signings to liven the place up. Squad looks quite big, but theres a youthful exuberance that I like about them as a whole.

No such regulation exists or is proposed in the UK. This is a major issue for a number of reasons:

* If gases are vented into the local area, there can be significant dangers for local residents - out of a fracking well you don't get pure methane, but a mix of all sorts of volatile organic chemicals, some of which are carcinogenic. This is why the RAE report I mentioned earlier recommends continuous monitoring around sites to prevent dangerous exposure, another regulation which is also not in place.

* If methane is vented into the air, methane is a potent GHG, and it moves the carbon intensity of burning fracked gas away from conventional natural gas (which is quite low), towards coal. This issue of the degree of methane release (not just at the well head but in the general fracking area) is the reason why there's a lot of disagreement about the greenhouse gas impact of fracking.

* If methane is burnt/flared, again, GHG emissions are increased, and you also get significant local area particulate matter pollution, which is already one of the major risk factors for heart attacks worldwide and in the UK (mostly industrial and from diesel engines).

I think you are overstating the involvement of unionists in the NICRA, the *vast* majority of unionists were happy to ignore 50 years of calls for civil rights. They were happy to use sectarianism to keep communities divided, and they gladly removed their own leader for trying to thaw relations with Nationalists. 


&gt; From 1966 to 1999 nonviolent civic resistance has played a critical role in 50 of 67 transitions from authoritarianism.

If you follow the wiki source for this statement you will find this...

http://www.aforcemorepowerful.org/game/index.php

A website for a computer game that is designed to promote learning about nonviolent protest. You can excuse me for not taking this as gospel. However if there is a grain of truth in this argument, I assume its counting the collapse of the USSR, which would make up a large majority of these figures. The problem with this is that authoritarian regimes don't simply hand over power because of a demonstration or strike - like the USSR did. Apartheid South Africa is a better comparison with NI in the 1960's (obviously the level of brutality in SA was on a different scale altogether). In SA it took 50 years of armed resistance to bring about a regime change, the same in Vietnam, Libya, Iran etc etc. The Unionist state thrived under its discriminatory legislation, there is no evidence that leads us to believe that the NICRA was changing their opinion, if anything, it was driving them to dig in their heels.

I'm afraid you are completely wrong, as even the most cursory look at the report shows:

https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/shale-gas-extraction/2012-06-28-shale-gas.pdf

Every chapter has a range of recommendations for how the regulatory regime should be improved. I suppose I can quote a small sample directly from the report:

* Inspections should be made onsite as appropriate to review that onshore wells are constructed according to the agreed design. There is currently no legislative
requirement for pressure tests or CBLs to be carried out. Operators should carry out such tests as appropriate to ensure well integrity. 

* Options for treating and disposing of wastes should be planned from the outset. The construction, regulation and siting of any future onshore disposal wells need further investigation.

* Operators should carry out site-specific monitoring of methane and other contaminants in groundwater before, during and after shale gas operations.

* The UK’s well examination scheme was set up so that the design of offshore wells could be reviewed by independent, specialist experts. This scheme must be made fit for purpose for onshore activities

* Arrangements for monitoring abandoned wells need to be developed. Funding of this monitoring and any remediation work needs further consideration. 

* Guidelines should be clarified to ensure the independence of the well examiner from the operator.

* Well designs should be reviewed by the well examiner from both a health and safety perspective and an environmental perspective. 

* Operators should monitor potential leakages of methane or other emissions to the atmosphere before, during and after shale gas operations

* The well examiner should carry out onsite inspections as appropriate to ensure that wells are constructed according to the agreed design.

* Mechanisms should be put in place to allow the reporting of well failures, as well as other accidents and incidents, between operators. The information collected should then be shared to improve risk assessments and promote best practices across the industry.

His hold up play in the first half was sloppy too, but he looked a bit more assured in the second half.  I think he was one of the very few positives in that game as he displayed a desire and work rate that no one else did (bar Lallana when he came on).  He's not the kind of player that will make a bit of magic all on his own though, he needs good service and players taking advantages of the things he can do for the team (creating space and pulling defenders around to open channels), neither of which he had in that match.

I'd love to see him get another couple of chances at least in league cup matches as they come up.  I think he's a good option off the bench too because of the energy he brings to the game, he's got to be a pain in the ass for defenders that have already played 60-70 minutes.  

I'm curious to see him play with Sturridge a bit too, Studge is really good at nipping into little spaces and Borini is amazing at creating those.

I'm worried he just isn't quite good enough (which sucks to admit because I really like him and I've defended him from the start 2 years ago), but I'm not quite ready to give up on him until I see some more of him this season.",0,1412870178,null,0,false,0,cl4sp0f,t3_2iqkef,t1_cl4sp0f,t1_cl4jjt1,null,1426609288,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

I find that odd considering the showrunners told us this episode would change the way we saw The Doctor.

The Doctor can still surprise us, and himself.  He can also still see things unlike anything he's ever seen before.  I think we saw that happen this week.  He talked in *Kill The Moon* about those moments which determine the course of an entire civilization and said the decision they made was that one moment for humanity.  He didn't say it was one of many moments for humanity, he said it was the one moment.  If his leaving humanity to make that decision for ourselves was unprecedented, it is still understandable that he would do so considering that moment was unprecedented for everyone involved, including him.

false,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"Actually what you see now isn't too far off from what they originally intended for regenerations although taken more to an extreme:

The first regeneration filled the entire TARDIS with an intense light and the Doctor tried to regenerate away from his companions before it happened (and I am sure that this was because it could possibly be dangerous). 

The Six to Seven regeneration was nowhere near as bright or emanating but it still consisted of a bright light altering his features. 

The Fifth Doctor was holding back his own regeneration with intense difficulty and could have died in the next minutes to hours, days if lucky (Ten may have been slowly dying from his own regeneration but we know from the Third Doctor that radiation poisoning can take months to kill). Although I do think the effect they were going for was more like what they did with the First Doctor so I think it somewhat fits the modern regeneration mold regardless. The whole TARDIS filled seemed to fill with some kind of light. The death itself was caused by a neurotoxin which could also possibly account for the visual variation in his regeneration.

Every other transformation that we see is affected by other situations:

Two is forced to regenerate by the Time Lords so it probably some sort of technology thing. There is also the Season 6b theory where it is possible that the Second Doctor regenerated long after his initial sentence was imposed (due to the comic continuations of his adventures in 1969 and then later The Two Doctors where we see a visibly older Second Doctor and Jamie).

The Third Doctor was dying before he could regenerate so he needed outside intervention to regenerate. It is possible that K'anpo was able to prevent the normal regeneration from affecting the Doctor and his companions.

The Fourth merges with the Watcher in a similar fashion to K'anpo/Cho Je.

The Seventh Doctor physically died. The anesthesia is ironically what both killed him and then saved him afterword. It merely postponed his regeneration. Since the body was already in rigor mortis it is very possible that an alternative form of regeneration is needed.

As for other Time Lords in Classic, I don't think any one of them did so on screen except for K'anpo but again that was a Watcher style regeneration. Even Romana stepped out of the room each time she changed her appearance if I remember correctly.

But then again we know little about Time Lord regeneration science other than it seems extremely complex and extensive so anything is possible.",0,1412870851,null,0,1412871295,0,cl4t1to,t3_2iqvkn,t1_cl4t1to,t3_2iqvkn,null,1426609122,4,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,4

Where the f is the mass coming from?  Physics was completely ignored.  I understand that in a story about a time lord prancing about time and space doesn't lend for a story fully consistent with our understanding of the world, but it seemed a bit ridiculous in how far he stretched it without really explaining it.  

I adore Capaldi, and I like that Clara was pushed to her limit in this show and called him on his BS, and he had nothing to say...

I hated the ending somewhat in that humanity did make a choice, and Clara, the companion, suddenly decides the perfect thing.  Humanity DIDN'T make the right choice, Clara did, and she's always the fix in the end, and it's getting old.

Interesting that Moffat decided to take out ALL the men and it was an adventure of three women making an important choice instead of the father figure deciding for them.  Just random thoughts I had.

Maybe I didn't pay attention enough.

Edit: I KNEW it was a freaking egg the moment the crack in the ground was opening up.  I just had that feeling (when that first guy died from the spider thing), and then based on what the doctor said, it was clear what the right choice was based on his decision, and I think it's stupid that suddenly there is a perfect replacement moon.  Once again...physics.

Also, wtf is this BS about not looking up until now?  I thought the Sicorax did that.  Sure, 11 rebooted the universe, but it surely didn't suddenly delete all the exploits.

Edit 2: Seriously, clara acts as some crazy solution.  Of course she makes the right choice as companion.  I think she should have made the wrong choice, and it would have made her monologue at the end make that much more sense.  The guilt of making the wrong choice and sticking with it, even though it all worked together.  Courtney or the soldier should have made the right choice instead.  And seriously, is this an analogy for democracy where your vote doesn't matter?  just shoddy writing if you ask me.

Edit 3: And the moon is perfectly textured again? Shouldn't the egg be smooth?  Colisions with spatial bodies can cause craters once more, but laid, shouldn't it be perfectly smooth?

I don't know if Moffat did that on purpose, but it seemed political to me and that irritated me for some reason (I am female, if that makes a difference).

* 'Is this the real reason they want to immunise all school children??? I'm beginning to wonder what really is in that flu vaccine that they want to spray up all childrens' noses next month.' (TheOnlyWayIsEssex, Essex)
* 'Is it too crazy to think that our government might want this to happen to ease our over population problem It's the only thing I can think of not close the borders and do simple checks! Our government have failed us massively and if i catch it as a result... I'll run to number 10 and see what they think then!' (Evertonlad23, Liverpool)
* 'And what about all the illegals We have porous borders. Another reason to vote UKIP. Cameron like Blair has been asleep on the watch.' (Tom, Swansea)

**EDIT:** Some more:

If you can't understand what I wrote in my original post its in layman's terms below. 

(You set the team up to counter for what Gerrard lacks.) 

You don't understand how the marking system works, when gerrard is the single deep lying playmaker he's an easy target to pick up, when you move him further forward there are too many people to individually harry (as you say).  

Then you go onto to talk about potential, POTENTIAL. All people have ever said about balotelli is potential this and potential that, yet in the 8 games he's looked good once.

&gt; I don't know if they are a net positive or negative health influence, but it's not a straight forward answer. 

It actually is pretty straightforward. Ecigarettes have been proven repeatedly by a wide variety of medical research institutes to be safer than analogues. Therefore every person using an ecigarettes that would otherwise be using an analogue is a net benefit. There is a minute portion of the population that use ecigarettes that were nonsmoker's, but I believe it has been demonstrated that those individuals come from populations that would otherwise have taken up smoking. (ie if you add the population of vapers and smokers together they essentially add up to the same percent of the population as previous years.) Therefore, if these people are going to take up smoking, it is a net benefit that they take up vaping instead. Further, there is no evidence that vaping ""normalises"" smoking. None.

I'm not, but it is quite shocking). Really America needs to catch up in this area, religion holds it back in many ways. Legalise it and get it over with.

5. A ""tailgate"" here is driving dangerously close, rather than a pre-sports-event party. We also have a lot more pressure academically than in the US to get into universities, and university is much more academic too. There's a general culture of suspicion towards the government in the US which would be seen as very strange here. And also nationalism is a lot more prevalent in the US. Finally, a lot more polarisation in all walks of life. You're rich or poor. You're ugly and fat or you're thin and gorgeous. There doesn't seem to be any middle area. Oh and the whole perfect, dazzlingly white teeth thing, that's a bit creepy, and depressing.

6. Yes, religion is far more relevant in America (although it really shouldn't be). There are pros and cons to both. America is obviously a huge nation which a very short history. Britain is the exact opposite. There's too many differences and reasons to list but just look at the history of the nations and you'll soon see why they are as they are.

In terms of drinking, you won't find many decent pubs in the city proper. It's all students of an evening, as is Leamington Spa. Birmingham's ok for an expensive night out, but if you just fancy an evening at the pub then nip down to Tile Hill or somewhere similar on the bus (the bus service is good, but the station is too open for my liking and there are quite a few robberies there).

On the subject of Tile Hill, the people in the Catholic Club may look ugly as sin and about as rough as a badger's arsehole, but they're generally alright, just try not to sound *too* American.

Warwick University is just on the edge of the city, in Canley, easily walking distance, so if you wake up there after being taken home by a newly-liberated fresher, you can either take a five-minute bus journey back to the city or walk it.

3) What are your views on the marijuana debate going on around America? I don't really have any views on it. I have my own personal views on Marijuana itself but not in the context on how it effects the US.

4) What are your views on the gay-marriage debate in America? Again, similar to Marijuana. I have my own personal views on the subject, but I have nil interest in how it effects those in the US.

I don't mind friendly and I can't put my finger on it, but in the UK we're politely friendly, whereas in the US it seems like in your face friendly from the moment I meet you.


6) Would you agree society is different over all in America than it is in the UK? If so, please specify why. Yes even across different states.

The regulations are clear enough to know that an independent consultant should be checking over the wells and that the HSE will base their decision on this. Whether this consultant is part of the same company should be a moot point as they're, by definition, independent. Whilst saying they should be from an outside company sounds like a good idea in principle potentially this outside company was the same company contracted to build the well in the first place. It's why independent is such a key word. It means they should not have any pressure from anybody whilst doing their job. It has worked well for the O&amp;G industry for the last 20 year so I see no reason why it won't work in the future.

I mentioned the science stuff first and she looked at me like I was crazy and told me nobody cares about that part.

So we both hated the episode, and for completely different reasons.

false,ukbabz,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshireman in exile,"By adding it to fuel duty, it's a tax on road usage not emissions as such and would actually hit the lower emission / higher usage users -- rather than the high emission / lower mileage usage.

For example, VED raised £5.63 billion in 2009 (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motoring_taxation_in_the_United_Kingdom#Vehicle_excise_duty_.28.27car_tax.27.29). And in 2012 we bought approx 34.2 billion litres of fuel (http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/05/uk-fuel-sales-plummet-motorists-embrace-efficiency).

So this means that to cover the costs, the raw (assuming diesel / petrol parity)  so this adds 14p per litre of fuel to cover the lost VED.

So assume you do 5k miles (8k km) per year in a current 0 rated VED car that does 50mpg (4.70 litres per 100km) this is 376 litres of fuel. The owner of this car will be £52.60 per year worse off.

Now for me, I pay £130 for VED and get around 48mpg ( 4.90litres per 100km) and do approx. 12K miles (~19.3k KM) per year. So how does this break down for me?

12,000 miles = ~946 litres which will cost me £132.44 --- so this will cost me an extra £2.44

How about the sports car owners with really high emissions and lower mileage at £1,088 VED - Take a Jag F type (source for band M car tax: http://www.nextgreencar.com/car-tax/band/band-M-list/) - say 5k miles at 26 mpg

This is 874 litres of fuel, at 14p per litre extra fuel this person pays £122.36 extra tax that year. However this is a saving of £965.64 on the worst emitting cars.",0,1412879422,null,0,false,0,cl4xn1p,t3_2iraq7,t1_cl4xn1p,t1_cl4touu,null,1426606981,0,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,0

I like that we're finally getting some character development but everything else in the episode itself felt like a throwaway, and it's adding more damning evidence that the makers of the show are ~~either~~ incapable of giving us both.

The whole episode was a build up to Clara's pseudo-breakup with the Doctor (come on, we all know what's going to happen next). It's nice that Clara is showing more depth but I can only find her believable if I pretend Series 7 never happened. She's starting to react like a normal human would in those situations (ie. losing patience and sanity), but only at times when the show is in character analysis mode. When the show is in 'advance the plot' mode, she only has 2 options: Plucky and crying, and I just don't find that intriguing at all. She saw and went through some pretty crazy stuff in series 7 and ended up walking into her own death without breaking the idealized caricature she was built up as. And it has nothing to do with the Doctor pretending to abandon her because in the Christmas Special, he actually did it twice and then threw her to the Daleks and it didn't phase her at all.

Moffat took a lot of flack for that but people have been so caught up with how the characters and tone has changed that they've overlooked, purposefully or otherwise, that the core problems that plagued the previous series haven't. The show still wantonly carves plot holes out like it's an Olympic event; the stories still lean too heavily on exposition instead of making use of being a visual medium; and the writers still can't give us a satisfying plot resolution to the hype of the premises they come up with. It baffles me, I've never seen a show try so hard to take an extraordinary universe and make it so mundane and predictable.

In the first season, Rose had a very difficult time coping with living in 2 different worlds and we saw first hand how it affected her entire world. It had other problems with special effects and cinematography but it took advantage of one of the greatest potential: the collision of 2 worlds. In every series that Moffat has been in control of there is virtually no difference for the characters being in a line up at the post office and being on an flaming, alien-infested meteor crashing into the earth. In spite of all the new effects budgets and set pieces, it's dramatically less interesting. And when it tries to demand the audience to take it seriously, it requires us to ignore so much of what they've already force fed us up to that point to have an emotional impact. In that way, it's constantly begging for forgiveness so we can feel emotionally manipulated because as soon as it's over, things just go right back to the way they were as if none of that actually mattered.

I could go on and on, but I'm writing this while I need to be working and I think I've made enough points to earn my evening's worth of people telling me 'nuh uh' and why I still watch the show when it clearly gets on my nerves. I'll answer that one now: because I still believe in the show's potential. It could be brilliant but all we're getting is average.

That's not entirely correct. Very often an argument is made that the state is inefficient at doing things, compared to the private sector.

The article does a good job at showing that this line of reasoning can be wrong.

&gt; Hence it's easier to be a bad state-controlled firm than a bad private firm.

There are plenty of examples of bad private firms that created such a mess that they needed to be saved by the tax payer. It's not just banks, but really, anyone who runs critical infrastructure of some form.

But the science was bad. Not just incorrect - because sometimes Doctor Who does science incorrectly - but bad. Straight-up bad in a tumbler. No ice. 

The morality play was bad. There were things that were fine (the Doctor stepping out of the abortion metaphor, none of the dudes sticking their biz where it doesn't belong), but there are SO many problems with the way the ladies handled this issue. Now, my personal politics lean very pro-choice, but I was prepared for the possibility of a pro-life episode because, hey, people have different opinions than mine and that's a good thing. But. In a story like this, you need real consequences from both sides of the argument. As a pro-choice person, I understand that abortion carries with it a hefty cost - it's financially difficult in places that aren't my native Canada, it comes with a lot of discomfort, and it isn't without emotional backlash. Being a person with a child, I also know that having kids comes with a hefty cost. I love my son to the tiniest of bits, but he is *also* a financial burden, has done a heck of a number on my sleep patterns, and can be incredibly stressful to deal with sometimes. 

Neither choice comes without consequences, and in this case, the ""right"" choice was consequence free. Earth has a moon-baby out there now, and everyone's just like ""Sweet, cool. Peace out, moon-baby."" And we have a new moon, because we needed to... figure out how... the moon... works now...? 

If you're going to give me a pro-life episode about the sanctity of unborn life, go ahead and do that. I can take it. Let me know that Clara made the right choice by letting the moon-baby live. Show me ways that it's a good thing. But don't let it be consequence free. Don't let her make that choice, against the expressed will of the human race, and have her walk away without any consequences whatsoever. From a story-telling perspective, it's total bullshit. You can't have someone make an impossible choice, choose between two equally craptastic options, and have everything be okay because they made the ""right"" choice. 

Now, you can overlook that if you want. Not everyone is as critical of choice in storytelling as I am, but I'm not pleased that the writers decided to move in that direction. I want my complex political morals to be a little more complex, and I want them to have depth, meaning, consequence, weight. Even if those morals are different from mine, I want you to convince me that in this story, in this case, it was the best choice despite the consequences, not because the best choice didn't have any.",0,1412880970,null,0,false,0,cl4yh8f,t3_2irnnj,t1_cl4yh8f,t3_2irnnj,null,1426606590,8,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,8

And yeah I think we should keep Borini for a bit longer if he's happy enough being 3rd/4th choice, why not? look at the clubs around us and their 3rd/4th choice strikers..

I can't claim to speak for all bus companies across the UK, but for Stagecoach (which cover a lot of the East Midlands) the bus drivers typically have to provide their own float. And if they are robbed, mugged, etc, they are not reimbursed for that float. It's their own money they're losing.

The change vouchers they give out are also valid for 3 months.

This means that the bus drivers have absolutely no incentive to carry change.

I used to work in pubs and the standard there was £250 in change in the till. Most bus drivers I know start with £50. Some will carry extra depending on time of day and length of route, but because of a huge lack of bakup from the company when it comes to having your money stolen, most drivers will carry as little as possible.

The most popular comments on Mac owners are the 'pumpkin spice latte white girls' (which I don't endorse in any way), and in my experience at uni, people who own them don't really give a shit about tech to want a new computer every few years and so it appears as if they last longer than laptops do. Personally though, I enjoy keeping up with new technology trends (both in mobile and computer technology) so my turnaround is a lot more frequent to keep up. My laptop could last as long as 5 years (especially since I've repeatedly spilt stuff on my old and new laptop and they worked fine and my current laptop has almost the exact same specs but at half the price (samsung ativ book lite)) but my desire to keep up means I only keep it for 2 years before getting a new one.

Of course this isn't true for all Mac and iPhone users and I recognise that. Some are interested in technological advancements but I'd assume that at this point in the apple game they are either in the minority, or have the high end macbooks with the best upgrades.

**1) What is your opinion on America in general?**

As with most countries, a mixed bag. I've met plenty of great people there, love a lot of the entertainment, music, etc. I have a pretty uniformly poor opinion on US politics and policy though.

**2) Taking the culture and rules of society into account, would you like to live there?**

No. Visiting is enough, but given the above politics and a few other things, I just wouldn't enjoy life there permanently.

**3) What are your views on the marijuana debate going on around America?**

Same as my opinion on the debate going on here - legalise it, legislate and bring control and safety to a market that will be there whether it's illegal or not. It can be a big cash crop and the revenue from it can help many.

**4) What are your views on the gay-marriage debate in America?**

Big supporter of the rights to gay marriage regardless of the country. I find the intense resistance disappointing and backwards. 

**5) What are the cultural 'norms' that you know of in America, that are different to your country (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland)?**

Tipping is a commonly brought up one, here there's very little tipping culture - you earn a tip for going above and beyond, not for just doing the job. I know it's down to the awful rules around paying staff over there though. Also there's much less flag waving and such at home compared to the average US occasion. Hardly any in fact. Also people seem more pushy-friendly: taking a very unnaturally familiar tone from the get-go, I'm a stranger damn it, it's not rude to not pretend I'm your lifelong friend from the moment we met.

**6) Would you agree society is different over all in America than it is in the UK? If so, please specify why.**

As others have said, religion seems part of mainstream society is one that's quite interesting. It looms over every discussion and decision in government and has a very knock-on effect in every single persons life (down to the availability of basic things like contraception in entire states), whereas here, while there are still plenty of religious people, it just sort of ticks away in the background not directly affecting a great deal. Despite the head of state also being head of church, I feel our separation of church and state is much greater than it is in the USA, our society is a great deal more secular. Big things like that aside, in general, every day life, the societies seem superficially similar, but the deeper you delve, the more differences you find.

**7 &amp; 8) combined -  What is it about American society/culture that seems ""not normal"" to you?**

Flag worship. Flags everywhere. Anthem blasted at every event no matter how small. It's an absurd level of nationalism that is completely alien to me and very disturbing. Once every four or five years, in the UK we blow the dust off of the union jacks and chuck some confetti about for a marriage or an Olympic event or something, but it's once in a blue moon. If I didn't watch England playing football I could probably go the whole year without hearing God Save the Queen without much effort - but it feels like I can't turn the TV on in the USA without hearing either the anthem or one or another patriotic songs within a few minutes.

Gun culture is something very different that I struggle with too. It's a big old can of worms that I won't open here, but jesus christ, some people mate.

If you need the money in, say, 5 years, and 100% of your money is in the markets, there is a meaningful risk that your funds at the end of the period will be less than at the start - in some five year periods, significantly so. Even if you invest in a diversified market.

A recent example would be an investment in July 2000 in the FTSE World index. By July 2005 you were down 20%, even including re-invested dividends. This is an extreme example but illustrates the point nicely.

Over 10 years, the chance of making a loss on all equities all but disappears, but there is still a chance, and there is still a meaningful chance that you will not outpace inflation.

Over 20 years the risk of underperforming inflation is minimal with 100% equities, but it is still there. Tim Hale's book has a good breakdown.

The most often talked about in investment is ""bonds"", which in this context means fixed-interest securities. Basically, lending your money to a government or company in exchange for interest payments. Government bonds (gilts) are considered to be essentially risk-free if held to redemption, and is where the ""risk-free return"" figures are derived from in investment calculations.

Another route is index-linked savings certificates from NS&amp;I (when available).

Other, less obvious alternatives are things like commercial property investment, or commodities such as gold.

London is almost entirely urban area and is densely populated - its population density is nearly 18 times that of North East England's and I would imagine, in addition to its resident population, London also has an enormous number of transient visitors (tourists, people visiting from business or simply passing through because airports and international rail stations are near London) who aren't counted in the population density - though I don't know what this figure would be. Conversely, much of North East England is sparsely populated. Densely populated areas have costlier infrastructure requirements, where the challenge lies in delivering a high output of service whilst causing minimal disruption (eg not requiring loads of space where there is no space to spare, hence building railways underground). 

Taking all of this into account, 24x the infrastructure funding per capita seems a fair and realistic figure. It would be better to compare London with other big cities in the North like Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow, that will give us a better picture of what the disparity is.

That being said, though I don't think London receives an undeservedly high amount of funding and instead gets a fair amount relative to its needs as a major centre of population, the fact that so many things are centralised on London leading to its substantial growth and expensive infrastructure needs is indeed a problem. It's a problem for the rest of the country and I imagine it's a problem for London too (with high house prices being one symptom of this).",0,1412884394,null,0,false,0,cl50d45,t3_2ir7p2,t1_cl50d45,t1_cl4xzi4,null,1426605699,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

Here is my take on Kill the Moon and the story arc.  It’s a bit long so please bear with it so I can set it up first.  And I agree with the many posters about the bad science but I won’t get into that topic here.

There was a big outcry about, in the context of this episode, an apparent anti-abortion message (not going to take a position here).  But if you apply the concept of protecting children/innocent life to the context of the season’s story arc it works differently.  I’ll get to the how and why shortly.

I notice that whenever the writers want to introduce a concept to set the stage for a future action or revelation, they drop hints in a preceding episode to prime the viewer to recognize it and buy into it later.  The manner in which they do this ranges from subtle to in your face.  This has been done in most of the episodes, usually by a secondary or primary character introducing something that will re-occur in a later episode (e.g. - DW doesn’t like soldiers – Clara’s boyfriend was a soldier – DW is like an officer who uses people like soldiers – DW’s soldiers are expendable).  The introduced idea may or may not be reinforced by another character in the same episode.  It will be revisited and dealt with by a primary character in a later episode.

Having started with some general observations, here goes my story arc theory, using the “hints” from various episodes.

Clara is frequently shown at Danny’s flat but never overtly being there overnight.  So maybe Clara and Danny got busy and Clara got “with child”.

The viewer is reminded of a rule from the classic series– no hank panky in the TARDIS.  Therefore it wasn’t the doctor that got busy.  The doctor can sense life forms without seeing them so maybe he has detected that Clara is pregnant.

Clara had her Kobayashi Maru moment saving the moon “baby” hatchling when the doctor refused to intervene.  While she was deciding whether to risk the earth for the unborn moon “baby”, the doctor travelled to the future to see what it held for Clara, Danny and their baby.  Clara held to her personal philosophy to protect children at all costs and ensures that the moon ”baby” hatchling was born.

When the doctor returned everyone to the beach, his speech about the future being unknown was about his having looked at a fixed point in time, possibly with Danny being lost or killed off, and Clara leaving to raise their baby.  Danny may be the one that has to face the decision of following the doctor’s orders, no matter what the cost, to save Clara, falling prey to what he warned Clara to be careful of.

The doctor’s speech was to try to convince himself that Clara’s and Danny’s futures could be changed.  The look on his face on the beach indicated that it was unlikely.  The failed attempt to do so becomes the season’s end episode and writes Clara and Danny out of next season.  If it turns out that no dies then the feel good ending has both of them leaving for a domestic life of child rearing future time travelers.

And, separate from above, what if that was the Impossible Girl knocking on the airlock door at the end of time?  Reminding us that if we are never alone.

Here is my take on Kill the Moon and the story arc.  It’s a bit long so please bear with it so I can set it up first.  And I agree with the many posters about the bad science but I won’t get into that topic here.

There was a big outcry about, in the context of this episode, an apparent anti-abortion message (not going to take a position here).  But if you apply the concept of protecting children/innocent life to the context of the season’s story arc it works differently.  I’ll get to the how and why shortly.

I notice that whenever the writers want to introduce a concept to set the stage for a future action or revelation, they drop hints in a preceding episode to prime the viewer to recognize it and buy into it later.  The manner in which they do this ranges from subtle to in your face.  This has been done in most of the episodes, usually by a secondary or primary character introducing something that will re-occur in a later episode (e.g. - DW doesn’t like soldiers – Clara’s boyfriend was a soldier – DW is like an officer who uses people like soldiers – DW’s soldiers are expendable).  The introduced idea may or may not be reinforced by another character in the same episode.  It will be revisited and dealt with by a primary character in a later episode.

Having started with some general observations, here goes my story arc theory, using the “hints” from various episodes.

Clara is frequently shown at Danny’s flat but never overtly being there overnight.  So maybe Clara and Danny got busy and Clara got “with child”.

The viewer is reminded of a rule from the classic series– no hank panky in the TARDIS.  Therefore it wasn’t the doctor that got busy.  The doctor can sense life forms without seeing them so maybe he has detected that Clara is pregnant.

Clara had her Kobayashi Maru moment saving the moon “baby” hatchling when the doctor refused to intervene.  While she was deciding whether to risk the earth for the unborn moon “baby”, the doctor travelled to the future to see what it held for Clara, Danny and their baby.  Clara held to her personal philosophy to protect children at all costs and ensures that the moon ”baby” hatchling was born.

When the doctor returned everyone to the beach, his speech about the future being unknown was about his having looked at a fixed point in time, possibly with Danny being lost or killed off, and Clara leaving to raise their baby.  Danny may be the one that has to face the decision of following the doctor’s orders, no matter what the cost, to save Clara, falling prey to what he warned Clara to be careful of.

The doctor’s speech was to try to convince himself that Clara’s and Danny’s futures could be changed.  The look on his face on the beach indicated that it was unlikely.  The failed attempt to do so becomes the season’s end episode and writes Clara and Danny out of next season.  If it turns out that no dies then the feel good ending has both of them leaving for a domestic life of child rearing future time travelers.

And, separate from above, what if that was the Impossible Girl knocking on the airlock door at the end of time?  Reminding us that if we are never alone.

You see, the anti-apartheid was targeting companies in a country with a certain ethical outlook. It was simply moving from investing from ""A shoe company in Africa"" to ""A shoe company in somewhere that isn't Africa."" This works because of the free market ideals: the consumers gave a competitive advantage to none south African companies. We still had these products made for us, but by companies with ethics we agreed with.

The Anti fossil fuel movement isn't about supporting companies with ethics we agree with, but about attempting to remove an entire industry. This would be theoretically possible if not for the fact that literally every aspect of civilized life depends on this industry: It's the equivalent of attempting to boycot water. Either one of two things happen:

1: Somehow this works, and billions of people die a horrible death of starvation and disease, presumably while greenpeace hippy liberals rape children in the face.

2: That this doesn't work because ""not dying of disease and starvation"" is considered a bigger issue than ""Greenpeace being a bunch of twats with aids"". Other companies by the investments because we need fossil fuels in the current modern world.

Not to mention, that equivocating using Fossil fuels, or ""A method of energy that is required for people to live, and will eventually be technologically surpassed (And would have already been solved if not for the hippy liberal green movement)"" with Apartheid, or ""A governmental system of discrimination and racism by a minority on a majority population"" is actually fucking offensive.

Abellio have stated that they would like new trains for Greater Anglia intercity services, although I think that depends on where the Class 91s and Mark 4 sets go once IEP replaces them on the East Coast.

&gt; Neither, transport Scotland's direct management of the franchise has done wonders just as TfLs management of the LO concession has been so good.

It would be nice to have something similar here in Wales...

&gt; Hitachi has been named as the preferred bidder (according to Tony Miles) so the trains will be one of the 'AT' models they launched earlier this year.

I need to re-read the last few issues of Modern Railways then, I though Hitachi had only indicated that they would be bidding for the tender. Would be a good win for them though, both to get more work for the Newton Aycliffe factory, and to have the first major customer for the AT trains.

EDIT: Scrap that. [Hitachi were selected to build up to 70 4 car AT 200 EMUs today](http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/rolling-stock/hitachi-selected-for-scottish-emu-contract.html?channel=542). Abellio are not hanging about with this.

&gt; Siemens would offer the Desiro city with the 380s not offered (siemens offer was probably a 700 variant with gangway and less commuter orientated).

Yeah, the 380 was only an interim design based on the 350, but with some components from the Desiro City IIRC. I suspect a 700 with gangway would end up looking like a 380 anyway, but until (if?) we see plans who knows?

&gt; They're due to start replacing HSTs on the ECML before those on the GWML I believe so they'll be available sooner. I reckon we'll see a few HSTs coming into service 'refreshed' with interior mods done before any chiltern isation occurs

false,hylianknight,smith,Smith,"As a Pro-Life Catholic, I think any reading of this episode as a pro-life parable is completely bunk. It's based on taking a couple lines completely out of context and divorcing it from literally anything else happening in the episode. 

A story about the destructive lengths humanity is willing to go through in the name of self-preservation and protection, a parable about the importance of continued space exploration, and a treatise on the nature of democracy and responsibility. All of these things are thrown aside in favor of taking a single line - 'But it's a baby' and construing an entirely new story around it. That line has nothing to do with the abortion debate, which is specifically about the whole 'when does life begin' issue. It's about establishing the nature of a Doctor Who Monster (TM) as being fundamentally innocent in the context of a debate on killing the monster. 

An abortion debate is one that revolves around when an action can be construed to be murder. This debate is about how much does the risk of death justify preemptive genocide. Nothing that occurs on screen in anyway encompasses the former. 

But for argument's sake, let's assume that the episode is meant to be an abortion allegory. Let's then look at what scenario the episode lays out. The Doctor and crew arrive and eventually discover that the moon is growing because there's a fully formed monster within it ready to hatch within a matter of hours/minutes. So even though the abortion decision exist in the context of finding out one's pregnant, the episode puts that moment at the absurdly late point of 'immediately prior to birth.' At this point we're talking about the equivalent of the woman being in labor. So forget late-late term abortion (which most people are against at any rate). At this point we're talking about straight-up infanticide. The killing of a baby *immediately* prior to birth. So the episode is resting not so much on the principle of ""abortion is morally reprehensible"" but rather ""infanticide (and genocide) is morally reprehensible."" 

In addition, absolutely central to the abortion discussion is the motivations for having an abortion in the first place. What scenario does this episode present? The hatching of the moon presents a possible grave and fatal threat to everyone living on Earth. Okay, putting aside that it's an awkward fit for any scenario that involves a women struggling with an intimate bodily  decision, there does exist one obvious one. Life of the mother. If you insist on reading it this way, then it's abortion in the context of when the mother could very well die from going through with the birth. 

And it concludes that a women would be morally wrong for terminating a pregnancy that would kill her? *WHAT* Given that this is actually a scenario where the freakin Catholic Church says that it's perfectly okay to have an abortion, you're seriously trying to tell me that Doctor Who is taking a whole episode to argue that women who need an abortion to save their own lives are committing terrible moral acts?!

Take a look at Tom Baker's last episode ""Logopolis,"" there are multiple mentions of this and the Master repeatedly says ""LISTEN!"" which is something the Master has always said throughout his run in the show. Why is Clara so upset with the ""Doctor"" this season? Notice how many themes of identity there are this season? We've had episodes where the Doctor regenerates and isn't himself, but it takes an episode or two to sort it out, but the theme is being carried out over this whole series. Reflections of Capaldi in mirrors, monologues with himself about who he really is,  The Master is not used to being a hero, he's learning what it takes to be The Doctor and its rubbing Clara the wrong way. And another key thing about the Master, he has his own Tardis, which has on multiple occasions landed inside the Doctor's Tardis.  Wait till River comes later in the season, she's got to come back, if Clara is leaving this season, remember what River said? ""Clara and I are mentally linked."" So River will return soon and she will not recognize this person claiming to be the Doctor.
 Ok, so maybe I'm totally wrong about this and lets agree that the Master WILL return during a later season. The last question is this, When he does return, Why would he be evil?

You can consider a regeneration such a section. 

Now, what if, say, you really like your current you, BUT you know that if X happens you will lose it *forever*. Would you still take it so casually? Probably not. 

Romany was fine with her regeneration because she didn't like Romana I very much after traveling with the Doctor for a while. 

Furthermore, even the second Doctor, while treating it somewhat as you describe was heavily against the Timelords forcing him to change. It's clear that it goes a bit deeper than just looks. It's more emotional, more personal. 

The Doctor doesn't like showing his weaknesses, his doubts. He hides them, especially from his companions. 

The only time he was alone and conscious while regenerating (minus the War Doctor which is a very specific case on its own for many reasons) was as the Tenth Doctor. So perhaps these are his true thoughts, his true feelings. Or perhaps it's specific to that interpretation. After all, he was still regretting the Time War and all, perhaps he felt like he deserved to die and thus tried to consider regeneration death so that he could fulfill his wish. This would certainly fall in line with his risky behavior and sometimes even flat out requests for being killed.

You can plainly see from the production photos that there will be a scene with the Doctor and Missy standing next to each other, out on the street, with some Cybermen behind them.  It does very much seem that they are connected, though it could possibly be that two storylines collide in that episode:  a seemingly simple adventure with the Cybermen suddenly derailed by Missy showing up.

2) Alan Bleasdale, writer of 'The Black Stuff'. Showed 'oppressed' scousers bleating about poverty while cheating the system and committing crimes. Oh that's how Scousers behave, how interesting.

3) The Liverpool Echo, tries to make a stink every time some (real or imagined) slight against 'Proud Liverpool' happens. Ringo Starr makes a half assed joke about Liverpool and the Echo goes into hate Ringo overdrive. 

Lane and Bleasdale were some time ago but The Echo keeps it all going.

To other English people, we come across as self entitled special snowflakes that want a 2 minute silence every time somebodies cat dies. All Scousers know that we are not like that but the rest of country only has what they read or see on TV to guide their opinion.

You have 12 years of habits to clear out.

First: do you feel fully comfortable on a bike after your CBT? OK with clutch control and being on the road on your own? If not, get a lesson or two down - depending on duration of the lessons. [Some schools are a couple of hours, others are all day]  
If you can afford it, get a second hand 125. Commute with it, explore with it. Find the limits of what you can do on it, that a school would not be happy with you doing (:  
This also allows you to learn even more at your own pace than with a school: at a school, either you're holding someone back, or someone else is holding you back. Very rarely will you get a one on one lesson.

&gt; I have some people saying get a 125 and run around on that for a few months, then I have others saying that because I intend to eventually get a bigger bike to get my full licence asap.

I passed my mod 2 last week, but I completely plan on sticking with the 125 for a bit longer. Just because you can, doesn't mean you have to.  
For many things, a 125 is far more forgiving than a bigger, heavier bike is. And even once you pass your tests, you've not finished learning. Not by a long shot.

Why do I have to be a professional to know more about the subject than you? I've undoubtedly spent more time at a higher level studying it than you have. It doesn't matter if someone is a professor in Astrophysics or a 2nd year student- they still know more about the subject than 99% of laymen and even people who have an interest in it. Just as life advice to ""young people like you"", people who have spent more time in a field than you have tend to have more wisdom and knowledge *in that field*. You're right that you don't have to automatically wipe their ass and bow down about everything, but don't try and suggest you know just as much as them in a subject they've spent much longer studying because you'll just look silly. 

Now you talk about how Balotelli is a ""consistent under performing player"". TIL that playing 7 league games with a completely new team (no players he's ever worked with save for Kolo, who hasn't featured this season) is considered consistently under performing. EIGHT TOTAL GAMES for fuck's sake. This is the exact criticism that Henderson came under- except that it was more understandable because it was Jordan fucking Henderson from Sunderland. This is Mario Balotelli- he's already won the PL, he's already scored a buttload of goals in the PL, top scorer in Euro 2012, took apart the German national team, and he's TWENTY FOUR years old. He has about 4 years of peak performance left in him barring injuries (and that's a lowball estimate). He hasn't even played 8 full games with Sturridge yet- that's the striker partnership potential I'm looking at. You have no right to write him off, especially given his history, based on EIGHT GAMES, please tell me you're joking about that, because that's just next level stupid. Also, if you ever accuse me of picking up my ""new favourite number 45"" again I will flip shit. Stevie is my fucking idol- I've got posters of him lining half of my walls. 

I understand full well how marking systems work- suddenly freeing Gerrard of a marker doesn't turn him into fucking Kal El. Even without a marker, do you think he can harry players, hassle the fullbacks when they push up, win the ball, break with acceleration, and play the ball to one of the strikers before any of the opposition midfield can track back? Let me answer that for you, no he can't. That's because he's 33 years old. Name one 33 year old that is still going strong as a *dynamic* attacking midfielder in the world, let alone the premier league- (protip, you can't). 

Then you suggest we completely change the system and remold it to fit Gerrard in up top. Scholes and Pirlo didn't have teams built around them- they were extremely lucky that the players around them were skilled/flexible enough to accommodate their playing style. Those players accommodating them were established, and somewhat experienced players (Rooney, Nistelrooy, Ronaldo, etc.) Are you seriously considering playing Henderson, Coutinho, Sterling, Markovic, etc. in positions *solely* to accommodate for Steven Gerrard going forward? Because that's exactly how you limit a player's growth. You're willing to sacrifice 3-4 young players' effectiveness, learning, and potential just to put a 33 year old Gerrard up front? That's ridiculous.

That's just scratching the surface- you don't even *begin* to understand that dropping to a 1 striker set up would simply lead to us scoring less goals, which with our leaky backline is a recipe for disaster. The reason we were scoring stupid amounts of goals last season was due to the linkup between SAS. Look at games we didn't have Suarez. 1-0 wins and losses. Sure, Suarez is Superman and El Fenomeno's lovechild, but Brendan's philosophy and the way the team was picked is meant to play 2 strikers and to have goal production between them, Sturridge alone isn't going to bag you 50 goals a season. Gerrard won't be scoring very many open field ones, and the goals he will score will have to come off of penalties and free kicks- which, oh would you look at that, Sturridge would have to earn in the box, a la Suarez. 

For fuck's sake, open your eyes kid. Gerrard doing well for 10-15 minutes, at the end of a match, up front, AGAINST WEST BROM, at home doesn't mean that it's a good option going forward. This is just silly talk, I'm not even going to entertain the idea any further than this. You can put whatever last word you want in.
