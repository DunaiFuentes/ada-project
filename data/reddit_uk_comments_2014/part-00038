[Royal parks](http://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/) generally permit cycling (though beware that some paths will be ped only) and have little or no car traffic. Tow paths (the paths that follow along canals) are bike/ped only but be aware that they are a ""shared use"" area and due to their narrow nature you will not be going fast if pedestrians are present in some areas. Cycling on the road is usually fine, mind. I'd agree that if you want to go longer distance and/or go a bit quicker Boris bikes aren't the way forward. That service is designed for making short-ish trips between stations, not all day touring. 

The more central you are, the more bike infrastructure there is generally speaking (e.g. contra flow lanes, bus lanes which you can use as a cyclist, etc.) and the more motorised traffic will be used to a cyclists being present, especially during typical commuting hours. Overall, it's not great but serviceable — but then, I have no idea what Philadelphia is like so it's hard to say whether you will be pleasantly surprised or think this is hell. One thing to keep in mind is that many of the inner city roads are quite narrow, so it's important to pay attention to road positioning.

However - for me, the issue stems from ideological differences, and what I would describe as the squandering of their position. In this government, they are the king makers. They could (and I'll argue should) have withdrawn their support for various ""things"" this governement has embarked on. Not least, the calculated defunding and disruption of the NHS, and to remain slightly on topic, the sale of the PO. 

They didn't. They toed the line and in doing misrepresented their voters by not playing the difficult negotiation game. I'm not saying they should spit the dummy at every occasion, but standing up to the tories on issues of creeping privatisation or intrusive public spying?... thats stuff to walk away from. 

By not standing up and calling their ideological differences as key to the partnership, they painted themselves into a corner as the tory whipping boy. 

Lets not getting to the complex issue of representation (60 mps vs 300 mps, or the number of votes cast in favour yadda yadda). It should be accepted that this current government have a painfully slim mandate to act on behalf of the majority. Both in terms of total votes cast, and votes cast for them.

It's deeper than that. Firstly, Russia is one of the only countries which is actively making life for its minority citizens and residents *worse*. Some US states (although I don't really know why US states are relevant here, given that the UK, shockingly, isn't the US) may have quite bad anti-homosexual laws, but they've been there for decades where as Russia is *actively* regressing rather than improving. Furthermore, and probably more important than my first point. It's not just about LGBTs. Anti-gay laws are just the latest and most prominent offence among a whole host of other abuses. Allegations of vote rigging in the Russian elections weren't so long ago. Russia's huge influence on Ukraine currently is worrying.

true,tusksrus,cnty-uk,Manchester,"I think that they have been a moderating force in the government. But the thing is, they haven't exactly been calling a press conference to discuss how they've reached a compromise. I think that, particularly given that as a country we aren't used to coalitions, that wouldn't actually go down well with the public. So they've been quietly moderating Tory policies apparently under the hope that people will give them credit for it in 2015. In practice, of course, people just don't know what's been happening behind closed doors.

At the Lib Dem party conference last year, Clegg made a speech where he (somewhat rhetorically) listed the things he and his party had said no to:

&gt;But sometimes compromise and agreement isn’t possible and you just have to say “no”. Inheritance tax cuts for millionaires – no. Bringing back O’ levels and a two-tier education system – no. Profit-making in schools – no. New childcare ratios – no. Firing workers at will, without any reasons given – no, absolutely not.

&gt;Regional pay penalising public sector workers in the north – no. Scrapping housing benefit for young people – no. No to ditching the Human Rights Act. No to weakening the protections in the Equalities Act. No to closing down the debate on Trident. Had they asked us, no to those ‘go home’ poster vans.

&gt;No to the boundary changes if you cannot deliver your side of the bargain on House of Lords reform. And if there’s one area where we’ve had to put our foot down more than any other, have a guess. Yep, the environment.

&gt;It’s an endless battle; we’ve had to fight tooth and nail; it was the same just this week with the decision to introduce a small levy to help Britain radically cut down on plastic bags.

&gt;They wanted to scrap Natural England, hold back green energy. They even wanted geography teachers to stop teaching children about how we can tackle climate change. No, no and no – the Liberal Democrats will keep this Government green.

[Read the whole speech here if you're interested](http://www.libdemvoice.org/nick-cleggs-speech-to-lib-dem-conference-2013-36294.html)

But this is really just another example of how the Lib Dems don't know how to do national PR. He makes this speech - but the only people listening are the few of us who actually watch party conferences, and the people who are so faithful to the Lib Dems they actually show up in person in 2013. None of this has received substantial press coverage, and the Lib Dems don't have a newspaper that supports them (like, I don't know, the Mirror for Labour or the Telegraph for the Tories... but newspaper alignment isn't my strength). The closest thing is the Guardian, but it's hardly a Telegraph.

The Lib Dems really need to work out how to speak to the country, because right now they only make progress on the local level, and that's not good enough if you want to play politics in the nationals.

&gt;As I said earlier, I would rather not have voted had I known that my vote would have been used as something of an affirmation of politic ideal that I despise. And that goes against my very core ideals.

I presume you did vote for them in 2010? I haven't gone through your posts, but it sounds like it. You were probably aware the most likely outcome of the election come polling day was a Lib/Con coalition - so what were you expecting? That the Libs would be a larger force? I think there are definitely some areas where I would have liked if they had done better, certainly. But I do think that when your MPs (which constitutionally speaking, are what matter) number so few compared to the larger party, there is only so much you can do.

&gt;

&gt;The **Northern Ireland Electoral Identity Card** is a photographic [identity card](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_card) issued by the [Electoral Office for Northern Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Office_for_Northern_Ireland), used primarily to prove the holder's identity when voting at a polling station in [Northern Ireland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland). Although the card's primary purpose is to prove identity and age while voting, it is also widely accepted as valid proof of age at most bars, clubs and alcohol retailers in Northern Ireland.

true,Buffaluffasaurus,null,null,"AVB didn't lead us to our record points total last season... Gareth Bale did.  AVB did very little other than put Bale in the middle of the pitch and hope he pulled out 30 yard screamers every other week.  Which, fortunately for him, he did.

I feel our play definitely regressed between last season and this one.  We came into this season with a lot of new faces, granted, but we upped our quality in pretty much every single area of the pitch.  I was very willing to give the team time to bed in, but at the end of AVB's reign the team were still playing like strangers.  He persisted with odd tactics - inverted wingers and a high back line - that clearly weren't working for us, but seemed too damn stubborn to consider anything else.

We looked toothless in attack and slow in passing and movement.  We hadn't scored three goals in a game since April, and then we do it twice in Sherwood's first three EPL games in charge!  And not only that, but we did it thanks to the one man AVB hardly utilised.  Whatever Adebayor's faults (and I think they are many), AVB screwed himself by not finding a way to get the best out of him, not to mention BAE.

I have no problem with a manager taking time to build and craft his side, but AVB was building a side no one particularly wanted.  He had no idea what his best midfield was, he couldn't set the team up to play to our strengths, and he was weirdly dogmatic to the benefit of no one.  He had plenty of chances to turn things around and prove that he knew what he was doing.  He didn't do that.  I wanted him to succeed, but there were so few positive signs, and at the end it looked like the players had given up hope.  The rumours (and yes, they are rumours) about him alienating people within the club and grating against many ring true to me based on the mood and atmosphere around him.

This has been a thoroughly dispiriting season, but the signs were there last season.  All that was bad about the team last term remained bad, and all that was good (namely Bale) had gone.  The confidence and self-belief Sherwood injected almost immediately should tell you one thing - AVB was choking the life out of this side.

Not only that, but there's also the transferable skills. I don't think there's any discipline in which google-fu is as vital a tool as in programming and quick, efficient troubleshooting and research are useful skills for anyone to have, not to mention the logical approach it fosters.

All that said, I'm sceptical of the way it's going to be taught. A day to learn how to teach programming? Not gonna happen for the majority of people; *some* people will be able to grasp the basic concepts and constructs in a day but it takes practice before someone gets vaguely competent.

I don’t dispute another attacking midfielder is of use given the age of Sterling and Coutinho, but Liverpool have some players on loan as well to fix that, potentially.  Instead, the current issues – defensive midfield, fullback, right centre back – all went unaddressed.  Yet, solve those issues, either with clever loans or purchases of first team players or squad cover, and suddenly 4th place is almost certain, with 3rd a possibility.

In the game, this was a simple case of trying to spot forgeries, traffickers, terrorists etc., but in the real-world, these things (you would hope) could be addressed with an additional Non-gender specific tag, as it were. Trouble is, as outlined in the report summary, UK law only recognises Male and Female genders. What they CAN change though is the ability to change the gender tag from M to F or the other way around.

It does not surprise me in the slightest that LGB, trans and intersex individuals would have concerns over their passports, therefore.

I'm helping him out with building a website/facebook and getting his stuff up online (for all his skill he's not great with computers). If you have any footage of him, or if he is featured in the video, it would be great to know. 

Here is his [band camp with a fraction of his improv music](http://iandell.bandcamp.com) and [his Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ian-Dell/591187360959818) to help jog your memory. He records each track in one take and then records the drums etc in afterwards. It's amazing to see. I'd recommend listening to ""Heaven Can't Wait"" or ""Music Tree"" if you have a minute.

If you don't have any footage of him doing his spontaneous improvisation of whole songs it really is a wonder to behold. The guy is a legend and we're just trying to get him as much attention as possible. That said, the chances are you will have already crossed paths.

true,Messisfoot,null,null,"&gt;The points on the table were the least of our concerns - the manner with which we'd accrued them was awful.

Whoa... what? At the end of the day, points are what determine your place in the table. We all wish our team was Man City, scoring 4 goals every match for fun. But until we become a regular in Champions League, it doesn't matter the manner in which we play matches. We could play games with 4 - 4 scorelines, but at the end of the day, world class talent doesn't look at these stats. They look at whether they will be playing at a club that regularly participates in Champions League. Interviews with Modric or Bale will demonstrate this. 

&gt;Had AVB stayed longer, I can only imagine us continuing to stagnate, and our bad play catching up with us with even worse results.

We still are. I wasn't a big fan of AVB toward the end either. But neither am I buying into Sherwood either. His results came out of games against Southhampton (3-2), Stoke (3-0), Man U (2-1), Crystal Palace (2 - 0), and Swansea (3 - 1). Of these wins, the only amazing score you could claim would be those against Stoke and Swansea. But then again, these teams are not really tests for a Top 4 team. Even the Man U victory is nothing to be proud of as last place Sunderland have been able to beat them. We still got trounced by Man City. We still got beat by Arsenal. And now, we tied with bottom half table team. Do you really think we are progressing?

&gt;Not to mention the fact that AVB was pissing people off inside the club on a personal level left, right and centre.

I'm sorry, but wasn't Sherwood just freezing out players that had just come to the club this past summer? I mean, AVB was pissing people off, but Sherwood hasn't proven to be the best man manager either.

&gt; More than that though would be the continued ostracisation of Adebayor, and further dips in team confidence.

See above.

Point is, Sherwood isn't the great savior your painting him out to be. And life under AVB might not be the cancer you think it was, at least it's not the root of our problems. Understandably, he had to go. But at the end of the season. With a replacement lined up. A long term replacement. That Levy would give full managerial control.

You can't look at the team and say there's confidence and self-belief. We don't look any more or less confident now. There's an emphasis on attacking play and maybe you're interpreting the lack of attacking play on a lack of confidence.

People are lazy and players are no exception. They want to do what they want rather than what's best for the team. Not consciously perhaps but it's true. They'd much rather have the freedom to do what they want than do the necessary but boring things that win games.

true,MrBushido2318,eu,European Union,"I think there's a place for constituent representatives and that place is the house of commons. That said, I think that the house of lords should be scrapped as an aristocratic club and replaced with a more technocratic representation of all the faculties common to universities. These representatives would be elected in a similar fashion to the house of commons, except instead of having the entire populace vote for their constituency they are elected by people who achieved a particular status in that field. E.g. A representative for economics in the new house of lords would be elected by people who have achieved a masters in a field relating to economics. Environmental science representative be environmental scientists. Law/Medicine/Politics/Economics/Languages/Maths/Physics/Chemistry/Biology/Psychology/Art/Music/History/Humanities/Theology/etc (perhaps with more seats for areas that are especially important to governing the country such as law/economics/medicine/sciences).

Then the main difference would be that not only can the house of commons create legislation to be reviewed by lords before it is passed, but the technocratic ""Lords"" would also be able to create policy. With the commons reviewing legislation that is proposed by the lords.

This way you have a balance between the want of the people and hopefully a more diverse house of lords (do we really want 26 bishops in the house of lords? not to say they aren't qualified for the job, but it seems oddly misrepresentative of our largely agnostic populace).

I imagine a side effect of this would be that more people would be inclined to seek education to higher level in an effort to be able to vote for seats in the house of lords. In the past I've had people argue that it would mean that the aristocracy would be able to buy their way to a masters and we'd get an inproportionate vote as a result. And while I agree it's not completely foolproof (the publics vote are bought via the media), at least it could lead to a more varied house of lords rather than the current situation where there are a large number of people who bought their way there anyway.",0,1391835801,null,0,1391836150,0,cf9zk3m,t3_1xab82,t1_cf9zk3m,t1_cf9t93l,null,1432304878,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

If you can find the 'right' thing to study, the benefits financially will far outweigh the cons in the long term.  However, if you are not sure what you are good at, or are interested in that would make it be worthwhile, then I see vaguely where you are coming from.

&gt; My high school diploma doesn't seem like it will get me into any universities

Where did you get this from?

&gt; ""access to higher education"". It's sounds like it'll be free for me

What makes you think that?

[ Students pay a contribution to their studies. In 2013-14, this arrangement will continue for Access to HE students aged 19-23.](https://www.accesstohe.ac.uk/Access/FAQs/Pages/Default.aspx).

&gt; go to university somewhere in the eu where it's free or very cheap... Maybe germany.

But most degrees are in German at the Bachelor's level.  Same with most EU countries having courses in their first language.  It's usually Master's degrees that are in English (to attract more international students).

&gt; I don't even know what I want to study

This is a HUGE hurdle.  So just because you can't think of something in Canada, you think that being in the same situation in England will be easier?  No.  Start thinking about this, talk to people, do observations, get a feel for what you like.  Consider a vocational/trade diploma.

&gt; Can I realistically get around in most cities with just a bike?

Yeah, if it's not too hilly.  Winter snow might suck a bit though.  Depending where you re in the UK, transit isn't always that great.

&gt; how cheaply can I expect to live? I live cheaper than basically anyone I know. I eat a lot of beans and rice, I ride my bike, I don't go out to bars, I don't have a smartphone. But I don't want to under-budget either and be screwed when I don't have enough money.

Look up UK rentals online to see.  Again, would massively depend on the place.

&gt; if you were in my position would you move to england?

You're young, it sounds like you need new experiences.  Why not?  Personally I think quality of living in Canada is VASTLY superior to the UK, but this will help you realise what you don't want out of life, which might help you find what you do want.

&gt; enrol in an access program and move to england (not London)
&gt; 

Firstly the Access courses are okay to get into university but its mainly meant for mature returning students, I'm not sure how it is regarded for younger students. If you can, try and see if your highschool diploma can get you into an [A-level course](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCE_Advanced_Level). Those are usually the courses right before university and are the traditional path. The A-levels will have straightforward equivalents in other EU countries and will make a university application easier, this may not be the same with the Access courses (I may be wrong!). So I would first suggest trying to enroll into an A-level course at a [sixth-form college](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_form_college). 

&gt; go to university somewhere in the eu where it's free or very cheap... Maybe germany.
 

Once you are a EU citizen, this will not be an issue. The only thing you have to be mindful of is the course requirements. They may teach in the local language and not English. This is generally the case for most of Europe. The countries which tend to have more degrees taught in English are the Scandinavians and the Netherlands. So if you cant speak German, look at those nations. 

&gt; not work in fast food anymore?
 
The economy is recovering a bit but there is not a crazy amount of job creation going on. Unemployment is still higher than the pre-crisis levels. Job opportunities depend on the area and the sector you are looking at. As a young person with a non-EU highschool diploma you will be looking at low level service work at best. Barwork, fastfood, retail etc that kind of stuff. You'll also be in heavy competition with locals for those jobs too.  

&gt; I have an easy time getting jobs here in canada. Shitty min wage jobs, but I can support myself. I have no idea if I could in the uk. I probably don't qualify for social assistance so if I wind up broke I'll be completely fucked and stuck in a foreign country, with no friends or family. That's pretty terrifying.

You can live off minimum wage but it wont be pretty. You're biggest expense will probably be rent and utilities. As for social assistance once you are an EU citizen you wont be left to rot in the streets (not that people usually are). If you are employed you will be entitled to the same benefits as a UK citizen. So things like housing benefit (help pay your rent). You can read more [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25134521). It's a touchy subject here but google is a good friend, and there is a wider variety of social assitance available. Other EU citizens here can probably clarify it more on /r/AskUK. 

&gt; Can I realistically get around in most cities with just a bike?

Depends on what you define as realistic. You wont see dutch style bike lanes everywhere but yes you can ride it and get places easily. Public transport is also an option and is widely available everywhere in Europe. 

&gt; how cheaply can I expect to live? I live cheaper than basically anyone I know. I eat a lot of beans and rice, I ride my bike, I don't go out to bars, I don't have a smartphone. But I don't want to under-budget either and be screwed when I don't have enough money.
I've seen some rooms for rent for £175/month. Are those alright, or is everything at that price cockroach infected?

The most important thing is to find a place to rent with others. It would be quite expensive doing it yourself. Also the price really depends on where you are, a good rule of thumb is the more north of london you go, the cheaper it gets. Although this of course is just a generalisation but it tends to relatively hold true. If you stick to your habits that you have, you will be able to live quite cheaply. 

Also while we do have cockoroaches they tend to be less common then they are in North America. I'm not really sure why. But we do have rats and mice and they are everywhere. Some of them are the size of small cats. 

&gt; if you were in my position would you move to england?

Yea why not, you're young and have very little to lose besides a year or two, which at your age really doesnt even matter. You experience a different but similar culture and have the opportunity to experience the rest of Europe. Even if it all doesnt work out you will come out on the other side a more independent person, which is a good thing.

true,urkspleen,present,Frank Lampard,"&gt; 1.Who are the good players on Chelsea?

I'll start by saying that Chelsea is a top team, and that they're all very good players. At first you'll notice that our attacking midfielders (Hazard, Oscar, Willian) are fantastic. They're full of flair, and have tremendous work-rate. But there's talent all around the team. We have arguably the best defenders in the league, and also the best goalkeeper (Petr Cech). 

&gt;2.What are some things from the teams history that I should know 

Chelsea was founded in 1905, and between then and 2004 they won only a single league in 1955, along with a few other trophies. Everything changed in 2003 when the club was bought by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, who injected tons of money into the club. In the 2004-2005 season Chelsea won it's first league title in 50 years. The next season Chelsea won again for back-to-back titles. A big part of this success was manager Jose Mourinho, a Portuguese mastermind. Jose left after a few seasons to build on his career, but kicked off a decade of extraordinary success. Chelsea have won something like 11 trophies in the past 10 years:

Europa League 2012/13, Champions League 2011/12, FA Cup 2011/12, FA Cup 2009/10, Premier League 2009/10, FA Cup 2008/09, FA Cup 2006/07, League Cup 2006/07, Premier League 2005/06, League Cup 2005/06, Premier League 2004/05 (it’s actually 13 trophies if you count the two Community Shields in 2004/05 and 2008/09)

But it hasn't been that easy-going. Abramovich demands success, and managers who have failed to deliver immediate results have been shown the door; 9 in 10 years. Most of all Abramovich craved the Champion's league trophy, the competition between the best teams from each of Europe's best leagues. In the 2011/2012 season, we finally achieved that for the first time in the club's history (or any other London clubs'). Nobody saw it coming, as our team was at the end of a cycle...it was the final hurrah of the ageing team Jose Mourinho put together in 2004/2005, and for many times during the tournament we rode our luck. 

Now the team is in transition, and Jose Mourinho has returned to build a new squad capable of replicating the success of the last decade.


&gt;3.What are the most important songs and chants? 

Hard to type them, have a listen to [these](http://fanchants.co.uk/football-team/chelsea/)


&gt;4. Because I am a fan of all 4 sports I have a lot of rival teams that I hate ( Rangers, Red Sox, Celtics, Cowboys). Now that I am a Chelsea fan, who do I hate?

We are based in London, and naturally have rivalries with other London teams (Arsenal, Tottenham). More recently, we have built rivalries with the other big clubs like Manchester United and Liverpool. Historically, we have had strong rivalries with teams like Millwall and Leeds.

&gt; 5. Someone told me that there are no playoffs in soccer. Is that true? Can someone explain how to pick a champion with out playoffs? 

Teams are not franchises of the league like in American sports, they are independent. As such, they are free to participate in multiple competitions. The main one is the domestic league, the English Premier League. The winner is simply the team at the top of the table at the end of the season, it is a measure of consistency. Other major domestic leagues are La Liga (Spain), the Bundesliga (Germany), and Serie A (Italy). Each of these countries also have domestic cup competitions (FA cup in England), which are knockout tournaments similar to playoffs. The cup is played parallel to the regular season, and is open to all teams in English football (including those from lower divisions). As previously mentioned, the Champions league is a tournament between the top teams from each of Europe's domestic leagues. In England the top 4 teams go, which is why finishing top 4 in the table is very important. The Champions League is also played in parallel to the regular season.


&gt;6. Are there any Chelsea bars in NYC? 

There's one called Legends, though not exclusively Chelsea IIRC

&gt;7. Is Chelsea good?

Yes


&gt; 8. How does offsides work in soccer?

Note that offside is determined from the moment the ball is kicked by the passer, not when it is received by another player.

do you have a link, because that seems very unlikely. Massively increasing university tuition fees are a hot topic right now. I have a hard time believing we're allowing foreign nationals to come here for free education (though anything is possible)

&gt;Can I realistically get around in most cities with just a bike?

Yes, totally. You'll need a decent bike a lock(s) and to use it, always ...   (I'd have a D-lock to lock the frame to something solid and immovable and a cable lock to secure the wheels to the frame)

&gt;How cheaply can I expect to live?

I'd be surprised if you could eat for less than £100 per month. Probably best to budget for about £150. Budgeting for renting a room for between £300 and £400 per month (outside of London). Pint of beer £2.50 -&gt; £7.00 (mostly about £3)

&gt;I've seen some rooms for rent for £175/month.

Depends where it is. There's a big variation in accommodation prices across the UK. If that £175 is anywhere in the South East for example, it's probably a front for Eastern European sex slavers ...

Generally, the further North / West you go (and away from major centres of employment) the cheaper it gets.

&gt;if you were in my position would you move to england?

Maybe, it's an interesting country. But you need money ... There are free things to do: museums, countryside but it could get pretty bleak stuck in a cold, damp bedsit over the winter. If you have a return ticket and can go home if you don't like it, why not?

It's definitely harder moving somewhere new where you don't know people. Though at least you are moving from one English-speaking country to another which is much much easier. Also, you will make friends at university. Term starts in September/October and there will be loads of events to attend to help you make friends. My advice is to get in early and attend absolutely everything you can.

You can live fairly cheaply here. Renting for £175/month won't be an amazing place, but if you're just renting a room in a larger house then it will be ok. You'll need to think about council tax (usually about £1000 per year, and you'll share it with the people you live with). If you're a full time student, you are exempt, but if your housemates aren't students then you'll have to work out an agreement with them.

Realistically yes you can travel around on bike. Most cities are ok with bikes. Though it will suck in bad weather.

Finding a job might be the harder part. There is quite a bit of competition at the low end, and I don't think it's that easy to walk into a fast food job, even though they are low paid. Minimum wage in the UK is £6.31/hr (assuming you are over 21), and that's generally what you'll get in those jobs. Good news is that you will pay almost no tax on that wage.

As for would I move. Yes, definitely. If anything, it'll be a good experience. New places, new friends. And the UK really is a nice place to be in general.

I can't really advise on whether you are eligible for assistance with things. You'd need to think about the university fees, plus your living costs. Uni here isn't free, and we have a student loan system (though less expensive and much nicer than the US system. No idea about Canadian).

It's called [New York City FC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_FC) and is jointly-owned by Manchester City FC (a top-four club and the bookie's choice for PL winners this year) and the New York Yankees, who you've undoubtedly heard of.  
  
Edit Note: Be sure not to confuse Manchester City with Manchester United, who share the same town.  United are the far more internationally renowned of the two, and arguably the most popular football club in the world.  
  
Manchester City are certainly a rival club, but this shouldn't majorly affect your support of the Yankees, since the ownership split of the club between City : Yankees is 80% : 20%.

true,[deleted],null,null,"As an American who follows sports in both countries, let me add two things you may find odd:

In all the sports you've listed, we have divisions and conferences within leagues. This is primarily to 1) reduce travel time so that the quality of play is higher and 2) promote rivalries even among teams that aren't matches in terms of quality. In most of the soccer-playing world, neither of these are issues: few countries are as large as the US, and the promotion/relegation system (more on that in a sec) maintains consistent quality, so more quality match-ups. Add to that the saturation of teams, and you get a lot of rivalries, particularly intra-city. As such, there are no divisions. This contributes to why there are no playoffs (because there are no divisional imbalances).

As for promotion-relegation, this is a second major difference. The US operates with monopoly structures: the big four are exclusive leagues, and the owners of the league have to allow new members to join (and prove they can be financially successful). Not so in the UK, where it's more decentralized and teams join and exit as an annual regularity, with the worst teams moving down (think the Royals becoming a triple-A club) and the best moving up. This has the unintended effect of making clubs take on debts to try to win promotion (or avoid relegation), and in the aggregate makes them less financially sound. Good news is it makes for excitement at both ends of the table -- this year's is particularly good, with essentially half of the Premier League worrying about being sent down.

&gt;**How the Scots Invented the Modern World: The true story of how western Europe's poorest nation created our world &amp; everything in it** (or The Scottish Enlightenment: The Scots invention of the Modern World) is a non-fiction book written by American historian [Arthur Herman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_L._Herman). The book examines the origins of the [Scottish Enlightenment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Enlightenment) and what impact it had on the modern world. Following the [Great Man approach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Man_Theory), Herman focuses on individuals and presents their biographies in the context of their individual fields and also in terms of the theme of Scottish contributions to the world.

Edit:  Bonus sources

**[BBC News - July 2012](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18695181)**

&gt;An internal memo sent by Mr Diamond to other Barclays executives said: ""Further to our last call, Mr Tucker reiterated that he had received calls from a number of senior figures within Whitehall to question why Barclays was always toward the top end of the Libor pricing.

&gt;""Mr Tucker stated the levels of calls he was receiving from Whitehall were senior and that, while he was certain that we did not need advice, that it did not always need to be the case that we appeared as high as we have recently.""

One moment you said that agents put in very specific clauses, the next moment you say that Guardiola misinterpreted the clause, which begs the question if why he did not make sure before revealing the clause to Arsenal without checking. 

As I said, release clauses have no legal precedent in England. Contracts are legal documents until they are deemed illegal, which requires challenging said contract in a court. While lawyers and agents do try to work within the law, contracts aren't sent for verification at the courts. I really wish I had access to my friend now, as she is a contracts lawyer, but she's on vacation so sorry for not having any citation. 

While release clauses have no legal precedent, they are, however, a strong bargaining chip. You must remember the part where I said most clubs honour release clauses as a gentlemen's agreement with the player. Rejecting a valid bid that matches the release clause would very likely anger said player, risking displeasure and a lack of motivation. Similarly, rejecting a bid that is well below the clause price gives the club an excuse and moral justification. In the end, a release clause is like an agreement of the player's value between him and his employer. Buying clubs are encouraged to bid at that price because it makes everybody happy. 

With that being said, transfer laws are incredibly murky, and things are constantly in flux. With more and more clubs utilising release clauses today, they are bound to face more legal scrutiny as time goes by.

I was getting my gear on with my kids, at the same time he was, and felt awkward as he was obviously there to relax. I went up, apologised and said I didn't want to disturb his family time but as a season ticket holder wanted to shake his hand.

He said thanks, appreciate you not making a fuss, and went on with a smile.

One things that's worth pointing out...I do a little work with housing developers, and I remember reading somewhere (or was told) the avarage house build is about £30k. That's materials and labor.

Your right everything is indeed subjective. In this series of photo's I have taken the view that it's not the drinking that is particularly bad. It's the excess. I for one am more than happy to have a few beers and have a good time and lots of people do. It is more often than not though that people take this to an extreme. Yet they wake up the next morning look back at the event's photographs of the night where the photographer has been paid to make the night look 'amazing' and they think they have a good night.  A sort of amnesia occurs where they forget that they were in such a state and instead take the staged photograph from the club as fact. So I thought it would be interesting to record the other side of going out, the side that is de-glamorised. 

As you said i'm sure different places will come up with different results. So far I have only been to two 'Party Cities' Manchester and Newcastle. I want to go to more and maybe like you said go to places that are quiet, quaint and peaceful. I still think you would be surprised and would find similar situations, just few and far between.

Unfortunately we've giving banks dominion over the pricing of everything (food futures, and bank dictated inflation) so demand is very inelastic. As a result we end up with the banks raking in profits which they then siphon off into bonuses. It's like estate agents and house prices- estate agents get paid a percentage- so it's always in their interest to drive up prices and again, you can't chose not to live in a house so demand is inelastic.

And he had no idea what his best midfield was because he persisted with partnerships that weren't working (Dembele and Paulinho as two CDMs), played Siggy, saw him score a few goals then dropped him, and changed wingers even when they weren't injured.

The basis of '6' is 'old school' to act as 'security' against a potential 51% attack or a double spend.

If ever you had a double spend then you would know it pretty quickly, and its extremely unlikely, and by extremely, I mean very extremely these days (I say that like we're old now.. but ye.. stuff progresses fast these days).

The 51% attack is even more unlikely (and economically unrealistic and very improbable).

If someone ever successfully sent you a double spend (e.g. the coins they sent you were orphaned), you would know it far before you sent out the stock. It's only an 'issue' for immediate purchases/receives, e.g. buying as beer from a pub, and again, falls on the 'extremely unlikely' category (imagine someone in a pub handing the bartender a false £20, then hanging around and drinking the beer they brought).

For Stoke he looks like he could be a great signing but we need to do better if we are ultimately aiming for the title.

Personally I would sell Assaidi and probably Borini as well. Borini is young and versatile but he is never going to start ahead of Suarez/Sturridge and he doesn't come across as a particularly potent impact player to me. We could probably get quite a tidy sum from an Italian club for Borini as well. That then opens up two spots in our squad for attacking players, an exciting wing player (Konpylanka) and a player that can provide competition as a striker (for this role you could possibly hold on to Borini).

Suso on the other hand is very young and has been very impressive for Almeria, his return to us will be a major boost and I see him as direct competition to Coutinho. That just leaves us with a Gerrard sized hole in our team. He'll obviously still be around next season but he is already showing his age and I think next season is when we really need to be starting the transition to life without Gerrard. I have no idea really who to sign for that position but I would not be upset at all if we brought in Ever Banega.

Aside from that LB would be the only other area to consider but a move there would depend entirely on how the likes of Flanagan, Kelly, Wisdom and Robinson have developed.",0,1391862702,null,0,false,0,cfa4uxo,t3_1xcjy1,t1_cfa4uxo,t3_1xcjy1,null,1432307441,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

One would say that he is certainly getting better over time BUT:

* Will LFC grant him enough time if he doesn't make the top 4 by the end of next season?
* He keeps doing the same mistakes again and again. Will he learn from his previous errors?

And yes, I still believe that Villa game was kind of a turning point. The win against Everton was just a fluke and the performance against WBA showed, yet again, our true face. If we win against Arsenal today, I will eat my words, that's for sure but at the end of this season, we won't probably finish top 4. But that wasn't the plan so I don't mind too much.

true,BrambleBees,wales-denbighshire,Denbighshire,"I'm currently working a voluntary placement at my local Jobcentre, where I am tasked with teaching less-IT-literate people with the use of Universal Jobmatch (and other resources) to improve their searches.  It's kind of awkward when they see a job that looks good and I have to gently steer them away from it.  I'm not exactly allowed to tell them that the government-run service is completely shite so I just advise them to, after finding a job they like the look of, whenever possible, approach employers directly.  And with agencies only approach those you know to be reputable.

I've raised this issue with a lot of the staff in the Jobcentre.  Many of them are aware of the issue but don't have the power to do anything, but a great many more just stare blankly into the distance.  They don't know anything about the systems they're forcing people to use because they've never had to sit on the other side of the desk.

Also, this article makes no mention of the huge number of fakes from other sources.  The area I live in boasts roughly an 80% fake rate, by my estimate, and I didn't even know there were issues with CV-Library!

For example:  https://jobsearch.direct.gov.uk/GetJob.aspx?JobID=6058305&amp;JobTitle=Waiter+%2f+Waitress+%2f+Bar+Staff&amp;rad_units=miles&amp;pp=25&amp;sort=rv.dt.di&amp;vw=b&amp;re=134&amp;setype=2&amp;pg=1&amp;avsdm=2014-02-07T08%3a31%3a00-05%3a00&amp;q=%22search+job+vacancies%22

(This isn't where I live, FYI).  These ads link to a completely generic page with no information that would allow you to identify the employer or even an agency.  Even the source code of the page is clean.  All you have is a form that sends your information God knows where and a bunch of ads making somebody money.

I also make a point of letting people know that they are not yet required to grant their advisors access to their account, despite how pushy the advisors are about it.

There are also a bunch of issues with the actual design of the site which make it nigh-unusable for many people.  I believe it was bought from Monster and retrofitted (badly).  It's not fit for purpose and a lot of my time is spent helping people with technical issues which shouldn't exist but could very easily cause them to be sanctioned because the advisors don't have a clue what's going in.",0,1391863732,null,0,1391864393,0,cfa50nc,t3_1xcgzw,t1_cfa50nc,t3_1xcgzw,null,1432307515,23,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,23

true,ruizscar,cnty-expat,South America,"&gt; If it helps, empathy is not something that requires the physical state of crying.

&gt; Empathy is an action and a practice that requires you to consider another persons values, ideas, opinions, beliefs, experiences, thoughts, fears, morals, memories, feelings, perspectives, goals, wants, needs.

&gt; And if you don't know about these for the person you can ask.

&gt; It is the act of considering the other person in your consciousness and actions as much as you can. You can do it whether you feel the same way as the person or not, whether you agree or not, whether you like the person or not.

&gt; It's not cut off from anyone, no matter what emotional state they are in. Which is why it's never an excuse for an abusive person to say, ""sorry I was just angry.""

&gt; All someone has to do is do it. Unless there is something that is more preferable to them (like believing they have to keep only their consciousness in the forefront at the expense of everyone else or they will no longer exist, i.e. narcissism/certain mental illnesses/eta: developmental or atypical brain processes/ptsd or someone in extreme crisis)

&gt; It takes practice, and for everyone there is always a way to be better at it, but empathy is an equal opportunity access to all humans. There are times when the reason you can't is because it's protective, and times when it's maladaptive.

&gt; It's one of the most powerful tools for health, its like a beacon. You always have it even if it may be difficult to use. But even recognizing that you can't practice enough empathy, and having that inform your actions, is in itself empathy, and it's more than enough.

On the whole Liverpool is a great choice and you wont be dissatisfied, and as you can tell I am extremely proud of the city and the University!

Consider the last question this week regarding female MPs. Rightly he asks whether having more female MPs actually makes a difference to how Parliament functions, as some have claimed it would.

Let's think about it from this perspective: AVB has never been a professional footballer. He has been a top football manager for less than a decade.

Adebayor has been a top footballer for a decade. He has played for some of the best clubs in the world.

If you're AVB, and Adebayor tells you in private - so as to avoid causing a stir in the dressing room - that your ideas are not right for the players, **you should bloody well listen.** 

We know how stubborn AVB was. If he told Ade he wasn't interested in hearing his opinion, then I really can't blame Adebayor for saying it in front of the team. 

Adebayor did this because he wanted the best for the team, not because he wanted to rock the ship. AVB's ideas weren't working and **it is AVB's fault that he did not listen to Adebayor and did not change his ideas.**

Since 2009 there has been increasing competition between export-lead nations (Brazil, China etc) to depreciate their currency and stimulate exports.

true,potpan0,eng-BlackCountry,Black Country,"&gt; If Margret has paid into the system all her life, our government should install better drainage systems and public infrastructure so this doesn't happen again around her property.

That's hardly fair. I'd bet the vast majority of people who receive aid from the UK would be fine doing the same sort of job Margaret did, for the same sort of money, as long as it meant they. Why should Margaret get held to a higher standard and deserve more? Because she was lucky enough to be born into a country where more money is?

You can't blame people for not doing something they had no opportunity to do in the first place.

&gt; rather than a country with a fucking space programme

So Syria, South Sudan, Etheopia, DRC, Tanzania, and plenty of other sub-saharan African countries all have space programs?

Yes, India might have a space program, and yes, you could argue we shouldn't send aid because of that, but that isn't a reason to cut all aid to every country.

&gt; We cannot help the world, that's Americas job now. We have too much debt here to even be giving away any foreign aid. We're simply giving away money we don't have. 

Can't we? We are some of the richest people in the world, regardless of how much debt we have, or deficits we have to pay off. We will always have the means to help those less fortunate than ourselves. 

&gt; It's like you living a place you can't afford, accumulating debt each month and then giving money to charity as well. 

Alright, let's make your analogy a little more accurate. It's more like we all live in a big mansion, with 15 swimming pools and all the newest mod cons, with the electricity on all the time and takeaway dinners every night, with money that our parents left us. So, by your analysis, instead of turning the lights off when we aren't in the room, we should stop helping out people who's parents didn't leave them a big mansion.

Whenever the government needs money they create a ""Bond"" they then sell this bond usually to banks and in return promise to pay the amount loaned back with interest. It's really quite stupid when you think about it considering that as a country we have the sovereign right to create our own money interest free. When we sell bonds the difference is that rather than us as a country making the money ourselves the banks create it out of nowhere and charge us interest.

This is all thanks to a debt-based monetary system where 97% of the money in existence has been created by banks out of nowhere when they make loans.

It's also thanks to reigning governments being happy to use debt both personal and public as a weapon to achieve policy goals. Until the voting public becomes more educated on the matter I doubt this system will change which might be a while since misinformation is rife. Universities still teach a model of economics that hasn't had any practical real world application in hundreds of years.

Staff.  YER A WIZARD HARRY...maybe.  Do you have to have magical power to use it?  Gandalf does some telekinesis and light stuff with it.  Cool if it works.

Wand.  Almost certainly us muggles wouldn't be able to use it, and if it exists then there are probably wizards who will murder you for it with fireballs and shit.  If you could actually use it, this would be the most powerful choice.

Sonic Screwdriver.  You're probably not going to be able to work it like Matt Smith's doctor, but if you go half-Tennant in effectiveness you're still going to be hard to keep out of anything locked.

If people opt of the NHS using statistics about themselves to better the service, and you agree that should remain lawful, why not enable them to opt out of the NHS all together?

Letting the NHS use statistics about when you use it, you're helping them better the service, just as you are when you pay taxes. And to be honest, giving money to the NHS via tax is much more akin to 'giving up your life', as with more money you can acquire more produce/services/other peoples labour.

I can't speak for other degrees, but they do seem to have poured a lot of money into the Engineering department.

The careers department/careers ""festival"" and the students union are completely useless. Don't expect to get anything from them. The careers ""festival"" will just cram you all into a room half the size it needs to be to get you to look at working for a supermarket, and the guild exists purely to take your money and do nothing for you in return. It is not cheaper in the bar than anywhere else.

As for the night life, there's plenty of bars and clubs if you're into that, and they're all quite close together as Liverpool city centre is quite compact, you can easily visit two bars on opposite sides of town in the same night without it being too painful.

It has got a reputation for being a dangerous place - but things have got a lot better over the past few years. I have never not felt safe walking in town at night by myself (but I would still keep to well lit streets since I'm not a moron).

Liverpool is pretty cheap. I'm not sure how it compares to other northern cities like Sheffield, but I would expect it's one of the cheaper ones (if not, someone will hopefully put me right on this - I've only ever lived in Liverpool in the UK).

I retain my privacy. You can give yours away, that's your right.

&gt;Should people be able to opt of paying taxes to the NHS?

Some would say yes.

&gt;So should people be able to pay less tax if they wish and not be able to get treatment from the NHS?

Some would say yes.

&gt;If people opt of the NHS using statistics about themselves to better the service, and you agree that should remain lawful, why not enable them to opt out of the NHS all together?

It's a fair point with lots of practical and ideological implications.

&gt;Letting the NHS use statistics about when you use it, you're helping them better the service, just as you are when you pay taxes. And to be honest, giving money to the NHS via tax is much more akin to 'giving up your life', as with more money you can acquire more produce/services/other peoples labour. 

It's not just about NHS use, it's about prior conditions and other unrelated information which may potentially be used against you in the future. This is the problem with mass data collection. Anonymisation is trivial to undo with enough correlated information. The NHS is good value for money, you would be hard pressed to find better healthcare in the UK for less.

&gt;I for one, want to keep our NHS and see it fit for purpose, if the NHS using statistics that I provide enables that, I lose NOTHING and the NHS gets something. So whats the problem with them having these statistics? 

Not just the NHS and clinicians will have access to them, which is my main objection. I do not see why the police and private firms should have access to information about my health which could potentially be used against me in the future.

true,CrashingAnalyst,eng-gloucestershire,Cheltenham,"Taxation contracts the economy though.

Think of it like this: the first £1 you borrow is at a low interest rate, the next at a higher interest rate, and so on, until you are borrowing at a relatively high/unacceptable interest rate.

In a similar way, the first tax £1 raised has a low contracting effect (you might just be taking £1 that someone would dump into their savings), but the effect increases until the point you are taking money away from people buying food.

Therefore the smart method is to raise some of your finance with the low-impact taxation, and raise more of your finance with low-interest debt. This is effectively how every corporate entity in the world operates.

Look at the inverse: if the government had a public sector SURPLUS, it might be spending £800/year but charging you the public £1000/year tax. That's theft and also contracting the economy as you have less money to spend. It's better to charge the taxpayer £600/year, and borrow £200/year from some rich institutional investor (pension funds etc.) who don't really care about getting close to 0% interest.

So to get the net financing cost as %age you would then do the following sum:

===

Weighted Cost of Taxation = (contracting effect) * (share of revenues)

+

Weighted Cost of Interest = (interest payments) * (share of revenues)

---

Total revenues

===

(thats a very simplified version as you actually have lots of different types of tax and lots of different types of expanding, so you need to expand the series... but its the same principle).

The choice for the government then is not whether it should or should not borrow - surely their obligation must be to keep the total FINANCING costs of government activity as low as possible. If they can possibly give everyone a 50% tax cut in one year by borrowing from the USA at 0% interest, then they surely should do so.

The choice for the government, is when planning *expenditure*, does the next project they choose to greenlight add surplus value over the financing costs? E.g. building a hospital protects say 1000 lives/year, individual life value IIRC is avg £1.3m valued, so your financing cost for this new hospital must be less than £1.3bn/year. If it's not, then the country would be better served letting those people die and using the resources elsewhere.",0,1391872189,null,0,false,0,cfa6yp6,t3_1xcqlj,t1_cfa6yp6,t1_cfa6o6z,null,1432308432,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

Bristol is a great city to live in and the University is one of the best. I studied there from 2002-2005 and ended up staying here. We've got a great live music and art scene, the city is pretty diverse with lots of cool things going on in different areas, it kind of has an interconnected village feel I guess. The student facilities are pretty good, and I know the Uni has a pretty active computer games society which my housemate is still a part of even though he graduated around the same time as me.

Manchester might work out a little cheaper, as Bristol can be pricey if you want to live in one of the really nice areas, but it sounds like you want to avoid the posh gits anyway so you'll probably want to check out the more cheap and cheerful areas, which have a lot going on. Gloucester Road for example is one of the longest independent high streets in the world, and has some of the best pubs in the city.

As well as all that, Bristol is beautiful. It's full of open spaces, mature trees and nice buildings. Transport is easy as we have great train and bus connections and an airport, and with two universities in the city there are lots of good deals and nights out aimed at students.

At the end of the day though, you're going to have to live wherever you decide to go, so I would recommend visiting both places and seeing which one suits you. 

Places to check out in Bristol when you visit

-Check out the Stoke Bishop campus. The halls up there are further out, but they're set in a really nice area and come summer there are some great party and bbq spots. I lived in Hiatt Baker for 4 years and really enjoyed myself.

-Visiting the Clifton suspension bridge is pretty much obligatory, as it's our biggest landmark.

-Behind Park Street is a lovely park and garden called Brandon Hill. It's just a few minutes walk from the Wills Memorial building and it has some really lovely views of the city.

-Check out Stokes Croft and Gloucester road - these formerly downtrodden areas are being rejuvenated, with local art all over the place and lots of friendly bars and cafes. 

-St Nicholas Market is good for wandering around, check out the Moroccan place in the Glass Arcade.

-Pubs...too many to even mention. Bristol has a huge pub scene, from ancient boozers like the Highbury Vaults on St Michael's to real ale and heavy metal specialist The Griffon, there's something for everyone. Usually several somethings!

-Shopping - I honestly don't know a better city than Bristol for shopping, and I don't just mean the shiny new shopping centre. We have a really good range of food and farm shops, local markets, fresh fish and locally grown produce.

In the last few days, Gox have announced that they are experiencing technical problems and have halted BTC withdrawals. This has caused the price to fall from its high position above the other exchanges to a low position.

In short, ignore Gox, look at Bitstamp, &amp; BTCe for a more accurate price.

Also, localbitcoins and bitbargain etc will generally have a mark-up just as a matter of course.

 [**2012 Scottish Cup Final**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012%20Scottish%20Cup%20Final): 

---

&gt;

&gt;The **2012 Scottish Cup Final** was the 127th final of the [Scottish Cup](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Cup), [Scottish football's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Scotland) most prestigious knockout association football competition. The match took place at [Hampden Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampden_Park) on 19 May 2012 and was contested by the [Edinburgh derby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_derby) rivals, [Hibernian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernian_F.C.) (Hibs) and [Heart of Midlothian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Midlothian_F.C.) (Hearts). It was Hibs' 12th [Scottish Cup Final](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Cup_Final) and Hearts' 14th. It was also the first time the clubs had met in a Scottish Cup Final since [1896](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1896_Scottish_Cup_Final).

&gt;As [Scottish Premier League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Premier_League) (SPL) clubs, Hibs and Hearts both entered the competition in the fourth round. Hibs won all four of their ties at the first attempt, defeating two other SPL clubs and two [Scottish Football League](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Football_League) clubs. After winning against [Junior](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Junior_Football_Association) club [Auchinleck Talbot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auchinleck_Talbot_F.C.) in the fourth round, Hearts defeated three other SPL clubs to reach the final. Hearts needed [replays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_(sports\)) to eliminate [St. Johnstone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Johnstone_F.C.) and [St. Mirren](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Mirren_F.C.), then beat cup holders [Celtic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.) in the semi-final.

&gt;The match was Hibs' 12th appearance in the Scottish Cup final and Hearts' 14th. Hibs had previously won two finals and Hearts had won seven. Because both teams were from [Edinburgh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh), many of the [city councillors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_councillor) requested that the final be held in Edinburgh at [Murrayfield Stadium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murrayfield_Stadium), instead of the traditional venue of Hampden, in [Glasgow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow). The previous final between the two clubs in 1896 had been held in Edinburgh but on this occasion it stayed in Glasgow.

Not true. I said this in my other comment - this is a professional, competitive sports **team**, not a government. Managers are not supposed to ostracize any player, no less one of Adebayor's quality. Managers are supposed to reconcile and make relationships in and between the squad healthy.

I don't think the same thing would happen with any manager. I think managers like Brendan Rodgers, Manuel Pellegrini - *good* managers, would take this kind of thing on board.

They just don't bother having these players in their squad because they know they're more hassle than they're worth in footballing ability. Especially when they can get players in their team of similar footballing ability who will fight for their team/manager.

Can it be said also that Ade was ostracised from the squad before our performances really dropped *that* low, and so saying Ade was right is really rather dumb especially when you say

&gt; Firstly, that's exaggerating, and we don't really know what was said. I very much doubt it was 'you're completely wrong, Andre.

Considering the same thing happened at City, I'm sure his manner of his behaviour is so very detrimental to the team that it really was that bad.

I understand the want to defend players that are currently at the club, and I think Ade's got lots of talent and I'll still support him when he plays, but I don't think we can use this as a reason to criticise AVB. Adebayor's got too much of a history of attitude problems that you can say that Adebayor's public questioning of AVB was justified or positive to the team.",0,1391875571,null,0,false,0,cfa81bt,t3_1xceqy,t1_cfa81bt,t1_cfa7u6w,null,1432309005,5,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,5

It seems to satisfy the appropriate conditions:

&gt;""Life Threatening Act""

&gt;Section 63(7) (a) of the Act states that one category of an extreme image is ""an act which threatens a person's life."" Such an act should be obvious on the face of the image; there should be no speculation of what may happen next or what could occur. For example, merely wearing a mask or other fetish wear would not in itself make an act life threatening. A life threatening act as stated in the explanatory notes to the Act could include depictions of hanging, **suffocation**, or sexual assault involving a threat with a weapon.

Strangulation is a life-threatening act. The only issue would be whether:

&gt;the image portrays in an explicit and realistic way any of the extreme acts set out in section 63(7).

And, since /u/TwistTurtle's boyfriend is actually strangling her, it would presumably satisfy that condition.

The real danger of this law is that absolutely no-one, whether in favour of it or against it, seems to know what it covers.

Part of that is just the nature of the law, it's designed to be open to jury interpretation, it's the culture of 'common law'.  The Obscene Publication Act, for example, hasn't been changed in years; but UK based publishers legally publish things these days that would have resulted in jail time twenty or thirty years ago; it's the same law, but it is interpreted differently.

But still I don't think vague outrage is the way to campaign against this law.  What specific things have resulted in a successful prosecution, that you believe should not have been?

true,DrBorisGobshite,lfc68,,"I'm not talking about World Class talent though, i'm talking about players that are going to make Rodgers think twice about his starting line up. Right now our attack picks itself, outside of Suarez, Sturridge, Coutinho and Sterling there is nobody worth mentioning. Assaidi and Borini aren't going to change that a great deal, Rodgers may be more willing to throw one of them on with 15 minutes remaining to grab a result but neither is going to be pushing to start at any point in the future.

What we should have on our bench are younger players at Sterling's sort of level, players that have World Class potential for the future but also have enough ability now to make a case for pushing to start. Players like Suso or Salah fit the bill perfectly and it's that sort of player we should be looking at.

If Assaidi was playing for Stoke at a similar level to what Sterling is giving us then you could make a case for keeping him. He's not though and neither is Borini at Sunderland. When Sterling or Coutinho are going through a rough patch next season I really do hope it's not Assaidi or Borini we have to turn to because we'd be better off playing an out of form Coutinho/Sterling than one of those two. If you want to save money then promoting Ibe and selling Assaidi is still a better move than keeping Assaidi. EDITL Just to add, I think would be wise to keep a close eye on how Tom Ince performs in these next few months. If he can prove himself at this level we could do a lot worse than pick him up for nothing.

As for Suso, he is not an Alonso-esque midfielder and I doubt he ever will be. Nor do I think they are looking to move him any deeper than the role Coutinho is currently playing. The two of them are very similar players and I would think it's extremely plausible that Suso will be Coutinho's understudy next season.

Finally, regarding Gerrard. As I said we should be looking at begining the transition away from Gerrard as a starter next season. That doesn't mean dropping him entirely but it means being pragmatic about managing his fitness. Gerrard will be 34 at the start of next season whilst we are also going to have European football to contend with. I absolutely expect that we will see him being rested for lesser games to keep him in peak condition for the big games. Obviously this means there will be an opening for another midfielder to take over when Gerrard is resting. Allen or Alberto are probably the likely candidates but I don't particularly rate Allen whilst I haven't see enough of Alberto to pass judgement on him.

&gt; The law never mentions or uses the word gay, lesbian, homosexual or any other LGBT identifier.

Oh for fuck's sake.  What do you think they mean by ""non-traditional sexual relations""?  The laws we used to have in the UK banning homosexuality used euphemisms too.  They were still used to send thousands of gay men to prison.

&gt; The law focuses on children, it’s title is “On Protections of Minors from Propaganda of Non-Traditional Sexual Relations”. The messaging and strategy to bring the ban on propaganda from the law of several regions to national laws is part of a larger family values push and is based on the successful anti-same sex marriage push inthe United States.

I don't even.  What ""successful anti-same sex marriage push"" in the US?  The one that has led to 17 states and the federal government recognising same-sex marriage in less than a decade?  Why on earth does opposing same-sex marriage require banning children from knowing about LGBT people?

&gt; Russia is actually expanding protections of members of the LGBT community: On September 20, 2013 the official delegation of the Russia Federation announced their willingness to take all required measures to prevent homophobic hate crimesand discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation at the 24th UN Human Rights Council.

Oh, they've ""announced their willingness"", have they?  That sounds really concrete and meaningful.

&gt; (stuff about ""only X people have been convicted"")

It's horrific that *anyone* has been convicted merely for talking in a non-negative way about LGBT people, but have you heard of the phrase ""chilling effect""?  Nobody was convicted under Section 28 in the UK, but it prevented lots of teachers from trying to combat homophobic bullying.

&gt; Statistically you are far more likely to be the victim of an anti-LGBT Hate Crime inthe United States than in Russia.

Your pdf claims that anti-LGBT hate crimes are 100 times more common in the US than Russia.  This is not credible.  Clearly there are major methodological differences between the two surveys this claim is based on.  Crime figures are often difficult to compare between different countries.

&gt; In Russia you cannot be fired from your job for being an LGBT individual, in the United States you can.

This is highly misleading.  In Russia, there are only certain specific reasons for which you can fire someone.  In the US, there are only certain specific reasons for which you *can't* fire someone.  In many US states and smaller localities in the US, sexual orientation and gender identity are among those reasons.  I doubt those laws about dismissal are enforced very well in Russia anyway, given some of the recent media reports about people being fired for coming out as gay.

&gt; Since 1993 gay sex was made legal in Russia, in 12 US States gay sex is a crime.

This one is a straightforward lie.  All laws against gay sex in the US were struck down by the Supreme Court in *Lawrence v Texas*.

&gt; While President Obama says “I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgender persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful tothem.” his policies demonstrate he has nothing but patience.

That makes no sense.

&gt; The group impacted most if found to be in violation of the law: Multinational corporations.

That also makes no sense.

Same problem we had last year where the teams would crowd the box and we just couldn't break them down. I thought the Kolarov for Negredo swap was great as he would open up some width, but Kolarov just couldn't get the job done.

None of our strikers seem to connect as well as Negredo and Aguero connect. Yaya was once again poor without Fernandinho at his side. We were absolutely lucky Norwich didn't put their last attempt inside the net. 

Two points behind Chelsea and one point behind Arsenal (who face United at home)-- I can see the Arsenal and United game being a 0-0 draw. Chelsea face West Brom away who has only won one game in their past fifteen games, so it would take a ***miracle*** for West Brom to hold Chelsea to a draw and an even greater miracle for them to upset Chelsea and take the win.

I also know some people who went to Manchester Uni and my brother lives in Stockport, so I have pretty positive things to say about Manchester as well. It has a nice music scene and the public transport system is substantially better than Bristol's. Substantially.

Also a lot of them are actually quite nice, down to earth people (though be fucking careful about living with them as they can be an amazing mix of stingy and frivolous. Not their fault, it's just the way they were brought up).

Like I said, I've lived here a very long time because it's a very nice city and nothing is that far away from anything else, so cycling everywhere is a great option (of course cycle theft is a booming industry here so get a couple of very good locks).

&gt; Your pdf claims that anti-LGBT hate crimes are 100 times more common in the US than Russia. This is not credible. Clearly there are major methodological differences between the two surveys this claim is based on. Crime figures are often difficult to compare between different countries.

His sources are all listed them and he explains the statistics come from Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) who publishes an annual report on the topic. Furthermore it shows:

&gt; [The 2013 FBI Hate Crime Statistics report
states that prejudice over a victim’s sexual
orientation was the second largest
motivator in hate crimes carried out across
the United States in 2012.](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/hate-crime/2012/topic-pages/victims/victims_final
)

I like that you glibly address the executive summary without much evidence. It is cute you quote Lawrence vs Texas but constitutionally it was all about a right to privacy in one's home, not about whether homosexual behaviour was legal or not.

&gt;  [The court wrote that private sexual conduct is not a proper regulatable activity for the state.  To invade their privacy in this way demeans their existence and disallows the individuals from seeking out their own destiny.  In this sense, this case is not entirely about the sexual act itself, it is about what activities the state can reasonably control when people engage in any activity in the privacy of their own homes](http://www.casebriefsummary.com/lawrence-v-texas/)

But I digress.. I am just not sure why you made a new account to post all of this, nor if indeed you will make other accounts just to downvote this comment as well.

Good debut from Salah, showed some nerves one on one but he made good runs  and his positioning off the ball was good so there's more to come from him in the future.

Willian and Eto'o complimented Hazard quite well although Oscar had a below par performance in the trio. Eto'o's assists today showed his quality link up play and he looks much fitter overall.

Perhaps he has a point that Scotland for most of it's history did not play a major part on the world stage, but the point is these additional jibes betray a certain bias against Scots that doubtlessly motivates the historical commentary (and it is *commentary*, his person interpretation of the past).

Yes, because that was *obvious* from your comment. Besides, that's not true either, you can be proud of your past, or more accurately in this case, take offence to childish insults and not be a ultra-nationalist, national purist or any other variety of nationalist.

Similar thing to what happened with me, except I was already watching the show when my life went down the toilet. I just wasn't obsessed with it like I am now. I was just a casual fan of the show when a bunch of awful things happened to me within a few months. I was in a very dark place. Suicide was in my thoughts daily. Then Doctor Who series 7b came on, and I watched The Rings of Akhaten, where the doctor gave this lovely little speech to Merry Galel, the queen of years: ""Hey. Do you mind if I tell you a story? One you might not have heard. All the elements in your body were forged many many millions of years ago in the heart of a faraway star that exploded and died. That explosion scattered those elements across the desolations of deep space. After so, so many millions of years, these elements came together to form new stars and new planets. And on and on it went. The elements came together and burst apart, forming shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbages and kings. Until, eventually, they came together to make you. You are unique in the universe. There is only one Merry Galel. And there will never be another. Getting rid of that existence isn't a sacrifice, it's a waste!"" And this really helped me. It really helped me through a lot. I just replaced ""Merry Galel"" with my name. And whenever I start feeling down on myself, I rewatch this scene. And people seem to forget about this speech because of the [other](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNmGbz2jiTw&amp;list=FLvb6tH8Mq2OtTBe1Pn2Tu8Q&amp;index=27) one. 

But Doctor Who helped me again in real life. Back in April when we celebrated April 23rd as ""The day The Doctor died"" where we put tally marks on our arms to signify the Silence (I have no idea how many people actually participated in that), I had to go to Wal-Mart to get some food while I had tally marks all over my arm (I had almost 200 tally marks by the end of the day). And while I was there, this really cute girl came up to me with tally marks on her arms as well, and asked me ""You've seen them too?"" Deciding to play along, I asked her ""What are you talking about"" them looked down at my arms and screamed a little, and she laughed. We then proceeded to talk about Doctor Who for a good 20 minutes, and then we swapped numbers before she went on her way with her own groceries. We then talked almost non-stop and watched the rest of the episodes of series 7 together. Then later when we both went to a party together, after getting drunk (my first and last time of doing it, since the hangover afterwards doesn't seem worth it to me), she and I ended up having sex (first time for the both of us, so we lost our virginities to each other), the next day we both kind of freaked out since we didn't use any kind of protection. We just texted, trying to decided what to do, and how to proceed if she turned out to be pregnant (luckily she ended up not being pregnant). We then decided that the we should actually hang out and just relax and try to get our heads on straight. So the next day we did just that. We relaxed. We went to the pool. We had a light saber fight in her backyard. And then we started watching some DW together, and we were cuddling, avid we just sorta looked at each other and started making out. It was wonderful. And now we've been dating for almost 9 months. And it's been the best 9 months of my life. I have my very first girlfriend, and she is a a wonderful girl, and I couldn't ask for a better girlfriend.

So, in short, Doctor Who has helped me in so many ways, I feel like I owe it my life. It's a brilliant and wonderful show, and I love it. I will always love it",0,1391880763,null,0,false,0,cfa9xre,t3_1xc470,t1_cfa9xre,t3_1xc470,null,1432309900,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

true,free2bejc,1986,Gianfranco Zola,"IMO a lot of the comments here have focused on recent success and the Abramovich era. Really, supporting a team is not about when it comes easy. To an Englishman or to most Europeans, it's basically like being married except sometimes you don't have a choice.

/u/ChelseaHistory is an important place to get started in understanding the history, rather than just the winning. A club is built on it's wins but largely on its failures. As much as Abramovich takeover was rather deus ex machina the club had been on the rise and stayed around 4-6 position consistently. The era of Zola and Osgood well before him are important. As is the King's road and it's reputation for being rather more European than most of London used to be.

Another rivalry perhaps not mentioned that much is a European rivalry. Not an official one if such a thing were to exist, but we bloody well despise Barcelona. 

Playoffs take place rarely in football because the general consensus is that our leagues last for such a long time that the best team is the most consistently good one. Not just the one on the day, that would be foolish to many football fans as a playoff is a tournament type mentality. A league is a different mentality. A tournament encourages moments of spontaneity, a league encourages consistency, drilled and regimented behaviour. Much more plan and forethought before each game. A manager might think about how he is going to face Manchester United before the season even starts, but with the way the cup system works, he only knows who to be preparing match tactics for a few weeks in advance. The Cup is for romance, the league is for the grind.

Chelsea don't have an MLS team, there's no rivalries there. The closest partnership we have is with Galaxy. Even then it doesn't really result in the loaning system benefiting because most teams don't deem the MLS of a particularly high standard. 

Also there are quite a lot of legal difficulties in owning two teams under the name of one person or one head in Footballing finances and FIFA regulations. Generally speaking leagues don't like it, smaller leagues seem ok with it and the Man City owners are a family and a corporation so they will list it as a business like the Glazers. Difficult saying the same in our case. 

The closest thing we have is an unwritten agreement with dutch team Vittese who are owned by a friend of Abramovich's and we loan players to them. The LA Galaxy partnership is rather a media stunt/exposure deal. Much like I suspect the NYC team is for City, and an excuse for Sheikhs to go on business Holidays. Anyway, it's clear to see the Chelsea US Media drive is doing well because you're here.

Yes it can be said such a law could promote homophobia if it was not in fact it directly applies to  those who are trying to target children. The law defines propaganda as 
&gt; ""Presents a distorted image of social equality of traditional and non-traditional
sexual relationships
"" 

One of the 2 cases cited in the paper one was of someone holding up  posters
reading ""Homosexuality is normal"" and ""I am proud of my
homosexuality"" ***outside of schools and libraries.***  This was to meant to specifically challenge the law and was an act of civil disobedience more than it was a promotion of gay rights. Either way it is pretty clear cut that if you do that sort of thing specifically to target school children that is basically what is out of order. It doesn't stop gay pride parades nor is homosexuality made illegal.

Err yes an no. It would be mostly financial institutions like pension funds, insurance companies , venture capital funds, hedge funds, banks etc but also rich individuals, charities and foreign versions of the above etc. 

&gt;can't be didn't we bail them out. 

We bailed out a small portion of the financial sector. Banks mostly ( some would argue that all financial institutions have benefited from ""cheap money"" - low interest rate loans. BUT the intended beneficiary of low interest loans were banks lacking credit ). If you look at the sums £1 trillion vs £500 Billion for the banks ( the total of the bank bailout )  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_Kingdom_bank_rescue_package

BUT if you look at the detail a vast portion nearly £450 Billion was in the form of loans and loan guarantees. This is NOT giving money away - it is money the government expects back mostly ( and will get back mostly ).  

&gt;Foreign Banks ?

Yes *some* of the debt will be owned by foreign banks. BUT we really want to pay that back. Failure to pay would see our credit rating decline and the cost of borrowing increase in the form of higher interest payments.

&gt;Thought they were mostly bailed aswell.

Chinese banks weren't bailed, middle eastern development funds weren't bailed, many pension and insurance funds weren't bailed . Some of the american banks that were bailed paid back what they took. Again banks (both foreign and domestic )  are only a portion of the institutions that we owe money too. Do you expect a german or american bank to take a hit on money owned to them by Britain because they were bailed out by their governments?


&gt; Other Countries ? 

Yes

&gt;which ones ?

many and varied but expect china to have a large share

&gt; The 10% ?

Errr If you mean rich people then yes they will make up a portion of government bond owners. but there are many more institutions that hold government bonds ( see first answer ) 

I think you are suggesting that we should just say call off our debt. The financial system is unfortunately complex with many globalised players. We cannot simply ""call off the debt"".

Edit : formatting


Edit 2: the bank bail out was £500 Billion ( of which £450 Billion is loans and loan guarantees.)

****

The United Kingdom, as a landmass, looks a little bit like a fat chickenbone standing on end. You've got a lump down the bottom, a lump up the top, and a vaguely skinny bit in the middle. The lump up top is Scotland. The left side of he lump on the bottom is Wales. (They're partly blocked off from England by mountains and language so most of England forgets they exist, unless they watch Torchwood.) The rest of the island - the middle and right lump on the bottom, and all the skinny bit in the middle - is England. 

The bottom lump in England contains mostly London. The great city, the home of the Thames, Parliment House, more statues than some countries have, museums, the BBC, etc, etc. Big Culture. Then you have Big Education - just barely north of London you have Oxford, and a titch further up - but still well within the fat bottom bit - you have Cambridge. Oh, the universities, home of the shaping of young minds, huzzah &amp; etc! Also museums and libraries and such. 

Then, after those two, you have.... the skinny bit. It's a whole lot of nothing, really, as far as Londoners are concerned. Lots of farms, and then the dreaded sheep country which smells funny, the occasional cow. There's Liverpool, and Manchester, both of which get a faint nod and some puzzled consideration (went there once for a weekend, bit dirty and not as much to do there as London) and then it's the North. They have a capital N on their highway signs. Londoners - fi they actually go there, which most don't - wander around the cities up there thinking, oh, how quaint! Look at how small and not-busy it is! 

It's mostly like a wasteland of green and bleak to city folk until you get up to Scotland and end up with Glasgow on the left side of the fat bit (rough crowd, there, the Londoners think) and Edinburgh on the right side of the fat bit (Oh, wasn't that where the medical school was? Yes, I'm sure, some famous medical school. And some Scottish Royalty used to live there until England did its thing and wiped them out or absorbed them.) 

Really, England is mostly London. London has most of the people, so most of the talk that comes out is London-based. It's a massive, massive city for a country the size of England. Most of the other countries that have cities the size and importance of London are bigger, or not on an island. The only other county that compares in country size versus city size is Japan. 

So the people who live closest to London are considered cultured, and the further away you live from London, the less cultured you're considered to be. Think of how people from Washington DC or Los Angeles consider farmers in Kansas or ranchers in texas. All yee-haw and hillbilly. Or people from Moscow think of folks who live in Siberia, or people from Sydney think of folks who live in Tennant Creek, etc, etc, etc. Every country has its ""cityfolk"" and its ""countryfolk"", with the same general stereotypes cropping up again and again for the differences between the two.

true,guilty_of_innocence,null,null,"&gt; The vast majority of our debt is owed to banks. Whenever the government needs money they create a ""Bond"" they then sell this bond usually to banks and in return promise to pay the amount loaned back with interest. It's really quite stupid when you think about it considering that as a country we have the sovereign right to create our own money interest free. When we sell bonds the difference is that rather than us as a country making the money ourselves the banks create it out of nowhere and charge us interest.

You do realise that there are two systems of making money that exist in the UK? One is government printing and the other is money created by fractional reserve banking. Fractional reserve banking is regulated by the government.  The government doesn't like printing money on mass because it is inflationary. The current government money printing that is then being loaned to the banks at low interest rates ( aka Cheap Money ) is a short term strategy to increase the amount of credit a bank can safely carry.  The intention of this short term policy is to recapitalise banks so that they can make new loans and thus help the economy get going. Cheap money has never been a long term policy.

The US has a 60% yes answer to whether homosexuality should be accepted, while Russia has 16% yes. There are certainly problems in the US, the fact they still don't have federal laws protecting against LGBT discrimination in the workplace is fucked up among other things, but Russia is still significantly worse. I mean Britain's tolerance rate, while still much better than many other places, is still disappointing (76%; lower than Spain, Germany, Canda, Czech Rep etc.) and the fact that Section 23 was only repealed just over 10 years ago and we've passed same sex marriage later than several other countries and US states is pretty bad.

Plus, if they had a document good enough to fool the DWP, then they've got a document good enough to fool the UKBA as well, which means they shouldn't be caught.

EDIT to add additional points:

* When looking for figures on illegal immigrants claiming benefits, you're not likely to find any; virtually every newspaper source in the country has taken to falsely calling refugees and asylum seekers, people whose legal rights are established under international law, as 'illegal immigrants'; this is totally false and is a common tactic amongst Britain's gutter press to fuck with people. People legitimately recognised as asylum seekers or refugees are some of the only migrants who *are* allowed to claim benefits - the vast majority of migrants who have work or family status are not allowed to claim any benefits, except sometimes contribution-based JSA under certain circumstances.

* The real problem is not, and never has been, illegal immigrants claiming benefits, simply because it rarely ever happens. The real problem is illegal immigration in the first place (which isn't a very serious problem compared to many other countries). In short, most illegal immigration in Britain occurs *not* when people enter the country (few people smuggle in through lorries or boats), but when people enter the UK with a valid visa and then stay beyond the expiry of that visa. These people are called 'overstayers', and this is actually an issue. The real problem here is that Britain has **no idea** now many illegal immigrants live in the UK because there are no immigration exit checks (they were abolished by Blair back in 1998). Also, Britain hasn't digitised all of its visas, so there's no way to tell when someone has or hasn't left. 

* Finally, even though this is a serious cockup by Harper, don't let that distract from the fact that the real failings in the immigration system lie with the Home Secretary, Theresa May, especially as the UKBA transitions back under Home Office control since it couldn't be trusted on its own (and you must realise that border controls *are* much more robust than most in the UK realise, because hey, the media fucking lies through their teeth on immigration because no one in the UK understands the system and how it works)

If people were actually serious about making the immigration system more robust, they would a) simplify the rules and eliminate historical loopholes that make enforcement difficult for incompetent officers; speaking of which b) hire more immigration officers, provide better pay and training - the staff turnover is hideously high; c) reinstate exit checks at borders and make all visas digital and able to be cross-checked with flight records with minimal effort (these are already in the pipeline).

true,Orsenfelt,cnty-scotland,Scotland,"No, for a country debt is leverage. If a country owes you money it's almost guaranteed you will be paid, this is especially true of a country like the UK that is incredibly stable with a strong tax base and huge influence. It's not going bankrupt, not entering a civil war, not going to experience hyper inflation. It's like being owed money by Coca Cola, highly unlikely they'll stop making money any time soon.

The country in debt therefor has quite a lot of power, say we owe China £150bn and we don't repay it. What are they going to do? Invade? Stop selling us plastic trash? Try and convince America to stop being friends with us? 

It's not just international either, some of our debt is money borrowed from pension schemes or even money created purely on the basis that by creating it we'll boost the economy so much it fills the gap (Kind of like an overdraft, You take £100 out the bank you don't own on the basis you can use it to earn £200). Same as above applies, is future-UK going to invade now-UK for borrowing money against it? Nah.

We as a country use these situations as leverage, we can tell China to stop sending nukes to North Korea or we won't repay our debt + interest. Whether that particular debt is important enough to them to listen is whole other issue but you get the idea, we have long term stability and wealth, we could be on the hook making them money for decades and we use that to manipulate other countries.

*If* the money we borrow is used wisely to further strengthen the economy/stability/etc then this works on an ongoing basis. **thenewlove**'s example is a good one, if we borrow money and use it to build a railway then that railway should add more to the economy than it cost. That better economy will then be used to borrow even more.

The *problems* arise when the world decides you aren't actually stable and won't be able to keep paying it back, like Greece. Countries realised if they kept lending money they would be putting Greece into a situation where it can't keep up with repayments and the risk is everything goes under. 

It's like credit cards. Say you reliably paid your minimum for 2 years, then one day you decided you wanted to just pay the remaining off. You phone up and say you can't be bothered paying 8% interest every month so you'll just wipe it clear and start using cash/debit only. What does the credit card company do? Immediately offers a lower interest rate. They'd rather you pay a small amount of interest forever than have you owe them nothing at-all.

Shitty customers that don't pay reliably, or don't borrow that much money might just get a wave tatty-bye but the UK is the exact opposite of a shitty customer.

Spurs had 100m to spend, everyone was wanking over their summer transfers and look how terrible their squad chemistry is now! Spending 60m after your best player leaves is never a positive thing, as your team will have bad harmony and be a worse side than last year. Spurs are clearly on the slide.

&gt;Not scared about Arsenal who can't keep their fucking captains to stick around while they have CL football. Pathetic.

Who's the best non-sugar daddy club in the country?

This was 2 years ago when we had to sell in order to buy players. Now we have 60m to spend every summer, so our best players are going no where. Do you really think Wilshere, Ramsey, Koscielny or Ozil are going to leave Arsenal any time soon?

Suarez is leaving, none of Arsenal's players are. Arsenal will buy a top striker in the summer, Liverpool will lose one. Save this comment.",0,1391886148,null,0,false,0,cfac26y,t3_1xcykr,t1_cfac26y,t1_cfablwn,null,1435502340,-2,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,-2

true,Galerath,null,null,"The majority of our sovereign debt is actually owned by normal people in the UK, in their pensions and their investments. The rest is mostly owned by foreign governments, investors and banks. 

My understanding is that Investment banks generally deal with other sorts of debt that are bundled into products called Complex Derivative Options (CDOs) and sold on to investors and investment groups. The unregulated trading of bad CDOs (that is, extremely dodgey ""toxic"" debt unlikely to be repaid that was given a bogus AAA rating by rating agencies) caused the financial crisis. When we ""bailed out"" the banks, that bailing out was mostly to help investors who were carrying the can on this toxic debt. 

Sovereign debt wasn't actually part of the problem, and, generally speaking, still isn't the problem. This stuff about Austerity is mostly to lower worker wages, welfare and taxes in order to promote more economic growth. To put that in less positive terms, the aim is to make the poor poorer in the short term so the rich get richer in the hope that this leads back to the growth years.

Anyway, that's another issue. The point is that Bonds (government debt), isn't what killed the banks, and is still not what's causing the problem. In fact, as far as I understand it, the banks trading in Bonds *weren't* the ones that went down the toilet in 2008 and they're still doing quite well. It was the banks trading in consumer debt that got shafted. The credit crunch is really a crisis in consumer debt - consumers (normal people) have been sold debt they can't possibly afford to repay.

Hear me out ok before downvoting.

I am very aware our squad is not as good or deep as City's, Chelsea's or Arsenal's. And I would take 4th place without question right now. 

**But**...we have City &amp; Chelsea at home. If we play like we did today, then that will be 6 points in the bag. I'm not saying we will, but hypothetically. That would take us virtually level with the other 3. Then the only other game where we realistically would expect to drop points is Man U at OT. I don't see why we can't win. Certainly don't expect us to drop all 3 points.

Our home form has been phenomenal, we just need to sort out our away form. If we can keep our home form up and bring our away form in line, we could may well get over 30 points from the rest of the season, and that would put us in a good position for top 3, if not 1st. 

It's so tight, it really depends on consistency more than anything. If we beat City or Chelsea, then top 3 would be more than achievable. If we beat them both? Top 2. 

Again, I'm not expecting this, but if we can pull off wins against them, then the title is certainly not just wishful thinking.

Let's have a look at today's game: No team had the chance to impose their style and start dictating the game when Skrtel scored his first. It's unlikely that Arsenal would have controlled the game today given the final scoreline and our complete domination, but they had to change their gameplan right away after Skrtel scored. When Skrtel scored his second from the corner there was no way that Arsenal could stick to any original gameplan they had; they had to attack more and open themselves up, giving us more chances to score on the break -- which we did. 

Maybe it doesn't have as much as an effect against a team like Arsenal because Wenger's philosophy is usually to have the majority of the play and generally has an attacking nature, however against smaller teams who pack it in or managers like Mourinho, who try to absorb pressure and then catch you on the counter, it is very effective as it forces them to open up and try and attack more in non-transition phases of the game.",0,1391889432,null,0,1391903362,0,cfadedd,t3_1xd90p,t1_cfadedd,t3_1xd90p,null,1432311532,10,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,10

* If you're an EU citizen, and you can prove that you're exercising your treaty rights, you can claim most benefits that a British citizen in your situation would be allowed to.

* If you're a non-EU migrant, you can almost never claim any benefits.

true,EnglishNumpty,cnty-england,England,"&gt;Perhaps he has a point that Scotland for most of it's history did not play a major part on the world stage, but the point is these additional jibes betray a certain bias against Scots that doubtlessly motivates the historical commentary (and it is commentary, his person interpretation of the past). 

That's just Starkey being Starkey though. He comments on a lot of different topics and he rarely does it without offending someone or other.

&gt;Yes, because that was obvious from your comment.

I did say ""nationalist Scots"" as opposed to Scottish Nationalists, because I knew some Scots would get confused since that language has become so warped up there, but given the context I thought it was fairly obvious to most people what I meant.

&gt;Besides, that's not true either, you can be proud of your past, or more accurately in this case, take offence to childish insults and not be a ultra-nationalist, national purist or any other variety of nationalist.

I said ""nationalist"", I didn't say ""ultra-nationalist"" or ""national purist"". I don't know why you keep putting words into my mouth but it's getting tiring. 

&gt;The nationalism ""in a separatist sense"" you talk about is called ""civic nationalism"", by the way.

The only thing worse than a condescending statement from someone who can't debate for toffee is a condescending statement that is just plain wrong.

Civic nationalism is hard to explain, but it is generally the idea of nationalism derived from being part of a community rather than an ethnic group.

The only document forging for an illegal immigrant would be a visa, since that's what they check first, and the Home Office carries the records of all of that anyway. The Jobcentre benefits adviser will phone the Home Office for virtually every non-EU applicant to confirm that person's status. If the visa and/or passport is forged, they'll know immediately, since there will be no record of that person. If that person's forgery was good enough to fool the UKBA officer at the airport to actually enter the UK in the first place, then falsely claiming benefits is the least of everyone's worry. And it's still important to remember that I've never in my experiences heard of people using forged documents to scam the DWP.

The only people in this regard that you'd have to worry about are EU passports, and whether or not those are valid. And again, if someone's made it far enough to actually get to a Jobcentre in person to apply for benefits, then that means their forgery has passed through immigration at an airport and was not caught there, and that's a much bigger problem than scamming the DWP",0,1391893156,null,0,false,0,cfaewct,t3_1xczn3,t1_cfaewct,t1_cfaenx7,null,1432312238,5,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,5

If the government sells £1 billion in bonds at 0.5% interest today, and they are 8 year bonds that come up for renewal in 2022, then in 2022 when the interest rate is probably 8%, if the government can't pay back the £1 billion (which it can't because the debt is increasing), then it has to renew the bonds at the new rate of 8%. Eventually all government debt moves from the 0.5% to the new 8% or higher, within a decade. Now calculate how much interest the government is paying when all it's debt is at 8%, and how much that interest adds to the debt every year, creating more interest. Within a few years the debt very quickly becomes unmanageable. At current debt levels the UK government will go broke if interest rates rise to 8%, and literally everyone, including the Bank of England and IMF, is predicting them to go higher than 8%. We will go from a situation where just paying the interest on the debt is 15% of all government spending currently, to where it is over 100% of government spending, within a few years. I actually think around 2025 most heavily indebted western nations will default similar to Greece and Cyprus because of this, we will see a real ""sovereign debt crisis"", even the IFS calculates that the government needs to reduce it's budget deficit by another 2/3rds just to keep our heads above water, the austerity hasn't even begun yet.",0,1391893210,null,0,1391893648,0,cfaex44,t3_1xcqlj,t1_cfaex44,t1_cfaehnr,null,1432312248,3,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,3

true,DukePPUk,null,null,"Yep; there's an accusation from some of the legal people involved that the CPS or police have been particularly targeting gay individuals, on a ""if it looks remotely dangerous it must be extreme, and if the person could possibly be under 18 they must be"" basis.

There was a more recent case where a man viewed gay porn on a hotel computer, and a week later another guest noticed the history and complained; he was arrested and prosecuted for making indecent images of children, and it wasn't until after the defence contacted the site involved and got them to send back photographs of every performer on the site holding up their passport that the prosecution decided to drop the case - some 2 years after it started.

Notably, the CPS were of the opinion that it was for a jury to decide how old the performers were, based on appearances, rather than needing to put forward any evidence that they were under 18. Story [here](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/man-wrongly-charged-in-crown-prosecution-services-homophobic-witchhunt-8918508.html), opinion from the main defence lawyer [here](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/the-evidence-is-mounting-is-the-cps-institutionally-homophobic-8918512.html).

The ""extreme porn"" law and ""cartoon child porn"" law seem to be used mainly when the police want to ""go after"" someone (perhaps they're investigating for a more serious offence and find no evidence for that) and need something to justify their investigations, and create public support.

But then it is hard to openly oppose these sorts of laws.

&gt; - Если вы думаете, что я эту форму создавал, то вы глубоко заблуждаетесь. Это, во-первых. Во-вторых, у нас запрещена пропаганда. Но у нас нет запрета на нетрадиционную форму сексуального взаимодействия между людьми. У нас есть запрет на пропаганду гомосексуализма и педофилии, я хочу это подчеркнуть. На пропаганду среди несовершеннолетних, это разные вещи абсолютно. Я хочу это подчеркнуть — в отличие от многих других стран мира, в том числе и США, у нас не запрещена однополая любовь. В некоторых Штатах предусмотрена уголовная ответственность за нетрадиционную сексуальную ориентацию. У нас ничего подобного нет, и поэтому можно чувствовать себя свободно, непринужденно. Только оставьте детей в покое, пожалуйста. Вот в некоторых странах мира, кстати говоря, уже ставят вопрос о легализации педофилии. Да, да, да! Да, уже обсуждают на практическом уровне в законодательных органах, — отвечает Путин.


Now feel free to run it through Google Translate but be aware that makes a horrible job of it.

The part you are referring to though goes as thus, emphasis mine:

&gt; "".. we have banned propaganda. But we have **not** banned  non-traditional forms of sexual interaction between people. We have a ban on the promotion of homosexuality **and** paedophilia. I want to emphasize this it is **propaganda among minors** and is a totally different thing. I want to emphasize this - unlike many other countries , including  the United States, we **have not** banned same-sex love unlike in some (American) States which have criminalized sexual orientation .

I have a Scottish grandfather but I would never in a billion years call myself 'Scottish' because I grew up in England. I might say 'I have some Scottish ancestry'  but I'm not Scottish. 

Similarly I have friends who're second generation British, having had parents who were Pakistani, Indian, Caribbean etc. immigrants and even though their parents and grandparents come from those countries they identify simply as 'British' or 'English' and on a demographics form that asks for race, ethnicity or nationality specifications they will tick 'British Asian' or 'Black British' NOT 'Pakistani' etc. 

The only people I know here in England who don't identify as British or English are people who don't have citizenship such as tourists and guest workers and it took one Iranian friend of mine about 5 minutes from getting her British citizenship to changing her facebook details to 'British-Iranian' So I can't fathom why an American with American citizenship living in America would have a hard time admitting their 'Americanness' 

When people drop the hyphen and move to being simply 'British' or 'English/Scottish etc' varies a lot depending on country of origin and individual preference, mixed race African and white people are the most likely to switch to referring to themselves as just 'British' or even just 'English/Welsh/Scottish etc' and South Asians are amongst the least likely. 


Scottish isn't a race, nor is Irish or Welsh or English or French or German... it's just a nationality identity and it's no more 'authentic' than being American or Australian. 

There's not even much unity within the cultural historical make-up of Scotland, the lowlanders had more Celtic and Anglo-Saxon influence whereas the Highlanders and Islanders had more Norse influence which links them to the North of England. The whole indigenous British Isles population is still ethnically over 75% Pre-Celtic, that is to say we haven't changed much since the Iron age and for all the invasions and national identities an English man a Scottish man and Irish man and a Welsh man are likely to be very closely related. We are more 'British and Irish' (descended from the hunter gathers who settled here before the ice caps melted and stranded us from the rest of Europe) than we are Celtic or Norman or Anglo-Saxon or Roman or Scottish or Manx etc. 

People made assumptions in the past based on limited evidence, but now that we can look at DNA the old myths  of 'Celtic fringes' or 'Anglo-Saxon take over' has been dispelled.

Well, no. It's none of anyone else's business on a day to day basis if a person is trans or not. If you travel, then international norms dictate that you have a document which has your sex on it. If you want to do this, then go travel, have this piece of paper, and then when asked, tell the person who asks that you're trans. What's so difficult about that?

Surely, by this logic, we can just use ""X"" for everyone who identifies as something other than M or F.

&gt;

&gt;Early in the morning before dawn, at around 5:00 a.m. Moscow time, the [searchlights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searchlight) that had been illuminating the main entrance to the theater went out.

&gt;Inside, although many hostages at first took the gas to be smoke from a fire, it soon became apparent to gunmen and hostages alike that a mysterious gas had been pumped into the building. Different reports said it came either through the specially created hole in the wall, that it was pumped through the theater's ventilation system, or that it emerged from beneath the stage. It is thought that the security services pumped an [aerosol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulate) [anaesthetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthesia), later conjectured to be weaponized [fentanyl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl), into the theater through the [air conditioning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning) system. The discovery caused panic in the auditorium. Hostage Anna Andrianova, a correspondent for Moskovskaya Pravda, called [Echo of Moscow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_of_Moscow) radio studio and told on-air in a [live broadcast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_television) interview that the government forces had begun an operation by pumping gas into the hall:

I'm fully aware of this. Nevertheless given the rarity of people who suffer from these conditions and the fact that *for the most part* they all cause their effect in a similar manner (chromosomal abnormalities) they come under the umbrella term, ""intersex"".

&gt;Surely, by this logic, we can just use ""X"" for everyone who identifies as something other than M or F.

I'd be happy to use ""X"" for everyone who *is* something other than M or F, but I'm not happy with just using it for everyone who ""feels"" something other than M or F. Sex on passport is like age on passport, it should reflect the body, not what the mind desires or feels.

In a very small number of cases yes they do, and I disagree with that. It says sex, it should describe the sex of the person involved.

Given the potentially huge gains (1000%+) from Bitcoin, they're likely to be reluctant to let that go.

However, the currency rules are probably more appropriate here. If you trade back to fiat, you're taxed as per currency trading. If you spend it directly, let it go as more hassle than it's ever going to be worth?

Also, there's not a single sex variable. Surely we should have multiple sex fields?

""Genetic sex abnormalities""

Firstly you are correct to state that there is currently no reserve requirement.  However this is a Post credit crunch policy. Up to 2009 the rate was agree with the Bank of England voluntarily. Voluntary reserve agreements made with the central bank are not the same as no reserve requirement. 

The video you linked me to stated that the money multiplier model was incomplete and wrong but provides no refutation or alternative model for this. 

The article links to a video where 2 people state that money is simply created by the bank when someone wants a loan. This is not true and is backed up with purely selective quotes that provide little detail on the process. The credit they create must be backed up by assets ( deposits ).  Positive moneys own explanation of how money is created (link below ) actually backs this up implicitly stating that banks need reserves in the bank of England ( base money)  Real Time Gross Settlement Processor account to back up payments to banks. OR you can think of it this way. If banks could just create money with no assets to back it up what is to prevent them from endlessly creating loans?

http://www.positivemoney.org/how-money-works/banking-101-video-course/how-is-money-really-made-by-banks-banking-101-part-3/


using positive moneys own figures

http://www.positivemoney.org/how-money-works/banking-101-video-course/how-is-money-really-made-by-banks-banking-101-part-3/

they say the reserve ratio pre-crash was 80 times more created money than base money. This is a reserve ratio of 1.25% - not short of what it was during compulsory blanket reserve ratios before voluntary ratios existed. 


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_requirement#United_Kingdom

&gt;From 1971 to 1980, the commercial banks all agreed to a reserve ratio of 1.5%

The truth is that that there were reserve ratios up until the financial crash when banks started hoarding money to pay liabilities and the government reacted to try and reduce the amount of reserves and get credit flowing. 

Nothing I have read so far in positive money actually proves that fractional reserve banking doesn't exist. Whilst positive money is correct to say that a reserve ratio is not always the dominant factor; 

http://www.positivemoney.org/how-money-works/banking-101-video-course/how-is-money-really-made-by-banks-banking-101-part-3/

&gt;The reality is that the total amount of money depends on the confidence of banks. If they’re feeling confident, banks will create new money by lending more. And when they’re scared, they limit their lending, which limits the creation of money. So the size of the outer balloon really depends on the confidence and incentives of the banks. Or to put it another way, the amount of money in the economy depends on the mood swings of bankers. Given that the amount of money in the economy can determine the health of the economy, does it sound like a good idea to have such an important thing decided by the mood swings of bankers? 

It is wrong to take an economy transitioning from a liquidity crisis and claim it to represent anything other than the unique economics of the current time. This does not refute the the money multiplier effect of fraction reserve banking as that assumes a stable functioning economy.  Nor does it refute the idea that the only money printer is the central bank.  

Having re-read your first statement I would guess you are a fan of either 100% reserve banking or gold as currency?

true,wosmo,null,null,"Primarily, it's because the north-south divide has 'always' existed.

When the romans showed up, they were much more interested in the south-east than anywhere else, because in the south tribes minted coin for economic purposes, and wales/cornwall/the north didn't.  It was also much more arable / productive land.

This continues into the post-roman period with the norse / north gemanic tribes filling in the power vacuum left by the retreating romans; the angles take settle in the midlands &amp; northumbria, and the saxons &amp; jutes in the south.

So you move into the 'dark ages', and 'england' is comprised of [7 kingdoms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heptarchy). So still we're divided.  Towards the end of this era, the norsemen start making an appearance, and after a lot of fighting, they eventually settle in what becomes the [danelaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danelaw) - literally the area the dane's rule.

The danelaw dissects the country, creating a very heavy division between the scots (a large part of northumberland was in today's scotland), the north (the danes), and the south - mercia and wessex.  And it's mercia and wessex that became what we today call the english.

But it continues.  Towards the end of this period, in the late 900's, the kingdom of england is unified.  But not long after, comes the norman invasion.  While almost a thousand years ago now, this is still one of the biggest turning points in our history - it changed the south forever.

While the normans took england, and then wales, they primarily settled the south - again, because of fertile lands, but also because it was closer to 'home' - and trading benefits this convenience brought.

The normans were also incredibly successful at stamping their victory into the language itself.  Legal, Justice, Government, Parliament are all french words - and not by coincidence.  The very anglo-saxon shit, fuck, etc become 'bad words'.  In every facet of this, one thing is clear - the anglo-saxons are the lower class, and the normans, the upper.  Also notable at this point is that a good latin bashing from the local cathedral ceases to be the measure of education - it's a norman education or gtfo.

Through the thousand years since then, this fundamentally held true.

The south is the richer, fertile lands.  It's the land of gentry, the ruling glassing, and the trading routes to the continent.  It's the home of wessex - the english ruling class, and the normans - the french ruling class.

The north are the norsemen, the angles, the vikings.  You can still hear this in every northern accent - a distinct lack of norman influence, and a lot of viking &amp; anglo-saxon throwbacks.

While this all feels like a gratuitous history lesson, it holds a lot more true than people realise - we're still separated by 1000-year-old tribes.

Vlaar was a big miss, but I think the system was the main problem. We were clearly the superior team in the latter stages of the game, when we went back to a more familiar system.

We do well attacking with pace from deep, using width. The 4-2-3-1 is narrow, and relies on midfield control (which we simply do not have). It's not coincidence that Albrighton had a massive impact on the game, since he's a direct, wide player. It's not a coincidence that our best chances (and best spell) came when we reverted to our normal wing play and put crosses in for Benteke.

I get why Lambert wanted to try the sexy football system against West Ham, but it was poor judgement, imo. I get it. West Ham aren't a strong team lately, and he probably felt we could have passed them off the park. It would have gone a long way toward silencing the dissenters who say we're not proactive enough at home... but it didn't work. In fairness, he changed the system and tried to get it back, but it was too little, too late.

Most of the classic who era is rather slow and cheesy, but if you at least want to get a general idea of who those doctors were, I recommend watching the 25th anniversary doctor who special titled 'The Five Doctors.'

As for new who, lets get started. I tried to keep the important episodes around 5, but I can't help it. needs about 6 per season, but you can skip the episodes you know really well.

It does no such thing. The only way to properly destroy data is to destroy the disc.

You can always, always, *always* get data back. Unless you encrypt a disc with a password so long and complex it realistically can't be cracked in you lifetime. If you want a proper good go at wiping a disc without twatting it with a hammer use DBAN (google it) and using the 35 wipe pass method.

Again, you can encrypt drives with something like truecrypt (or even install a hidden OS that requires a specific password when your BIOS loads - type in password A and your main OS will load, but type in password B and your hidden one will load. Ideal if you're a terrorist or a child pornographer hoarder and yes, they do use this because they're pretty hard to find never mind access) but eventually it can be cracked. If it's in your lifetime depends on how complex the password is. If you just use a really basic cypher it will be cracked, but if you use something like a 25 alphanumeric string with characters like #/?/! in them then it increases the strength massively.

&gt;Association between tramadol and benzodia- zepine has frequently been described in the literature in fatal cases of intoxication involving tramadol. This association must raise questions regarding the risk of this association and eventually a decrease of the tramadol toxic level in this occurrence. However, benzodiazepines may decrease the incidence of seizures in tramadol overdose cases.

...

&gt;tramadol and benzodiazepine interactions are not well documented

...

&gt;To date, similarities between tramadol and buprenorphine have never been suggested, as well as cytochrome P450- based interactions between tramadol and benzodiazepine. However, the high frequency of benzodiazepine in tramadol fatalities is not purely random. This combinated toxicity suggests a link between drugs. Finally, physicians should be aware of the potential toxic effects and use tramadol with caution when associated to benzodiazepines.

So it's possible but not proven yet, and I'd imagine the doses prescribed by your doctor and dispensed by your pharmacist would be safe enough, especially when tramadol and oxazepam used to treat respiratory issues in some elderly people.

A Nigerian illegal immigrant who claimed £83,000 in benefits was jailed for 15 months today (Thurs).

MUWONGE: TWO YEARS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT BIGAMIST BENEFIT CHEAT
TULSE HILL; GRIMSBY; ENFIELD; NEWHAM An illegal immigrant married by the Archbishop of York has been jailed for two-and-a-half years after fraudulently claiming £147,000 worth of benefits.

TOOTING An illegal immigrant lived and worked in the Britain for more than a decade before being detected, a court heard today (Weds). Kamat Ali, 67, was only caught out when he tried to apply for a National Insurance number so he could claim benefits. Bangladeshi-born Ali was caught out after officials became suspicious while checking a passport stamp which claimed he had the right to work and live in the UK. In reality, he had bought the forgery from a 'specialist agency' after working a series of jobs in the 'black economy' for almost 12 years, Kingston Crown Court heard.

ILBURN, NW LONDON: An illegal immigrant caught dancing 'vigorously' at his wedding after claiming he was paralysed from the neck down to swindle almost £400,000 in benefits was today (Fri) jailed for almost seven years. Mohammed Bouzalim, 37, was caught on camera celebrating his marriage nine years after arriving from in the UK and launching the elaborate con.
Adeola Thomas, 38, ran a scam that involved filling out nearly 2,500 claim forms by hand.

He managed to get £87,000 paid out but was trapped when benefits staff noticed the same address for multiple claims.

The fraudster, living in Hackney, east London, was arrested at a cashpoint last October while under surveillance by teams from HM Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions.

Thomas, who had 17 Post Office account cards in ­ different names, was helped by his partner Abimbola Abiola, 34.

AN illegal immigrant and bigamist who was married by the Archbishop of York has been jailed for two and a half years for benefit fraud in London today.


Ingrid Coipel, 38, claimed job seekers allowance, tax credits, housing benefit, child benefits and council tax benefits for six years up to 2012.

&gt; Remember the zimbabwain xfactor contestant who had 'no recourse to public funds' on her passport whilst in a cooncil hoose and claiming working tax credit

Nope, the Home Office fucked up. 

""Regarding the benefits claim, Mr Farrell said Mrs Ngazana was advised by the Inland Revenue that she was entitled to claim Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit and that it was aware of her immigration status [...] ""And we will show that our client was given permission by the Inland Revenue in the full knowledge of her immigration status."""" [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11482391)

[Her appeal was successful](http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/11/30/x-factor-star-gamu-avoids-deportation_n_1120033.html) and the Home Office was found to be in error. She and her family continue to reside in Britain as genuine asylum seekers.

&gt; A Nigerian illegal immigrant who claimed £83,000 in benefits was jailed for 15 months today

From [your source](http://www.courtnewsuk.co.uk/newsgallery/?page=2&amp;news_id=34586): ""The mother of-two came to Britain on a false passport in 2005 before procuring herself a counterfeit French passport to use in the UK."" Remember how I said earlier that if the documents are forged and they were able to get past the UKBA in the airport, that's a *far* greater concern than simple benefit fraud? Still applies here. This isn't the DWP's fault - this is the UKBA's fault. They should have caught her at the airport so she was never in a place to claim benefits to begin with.

&gt; TOOTING An illegal immigrant lived and worked in the Britain for more than a decade before being detected, a court heard today (Weds). Kamat Ali, 67, was only caught out when he tried to apply for a National Insurance number so he could claim benefits. Bangladeshi-born Ali was caught out after officials became suspicious while checking a passport stamp which claimed he had the right to work and live in the UK. In reality, he had bought the forgery from a 'specialist agency' after working a series of jobs in the 'black economy' for almost 12 years, Kingston Crown Court heard.

So he was caught when he tried to apply for a NI number? Good, the system worked.

&gt; ILBURN, NW LONDON: An illegal immigrant caught dancing 'vigorously' at his wedding after claiming he was paralysed from the neck down to swindle almost £400,000 in benefits was today (Fri) jailed for almost seven years. Mohammed Bouzalim, 37, was caught on camera celebrating his marriage nine years after arriving from in the UK and launching the elaborate con. 

""Moroccan-born Bouzalim arrived in the UK on June 13, 2001, saying he was an Afghan national whose father had been slain by the Taliban for being a high-ranking member of a political party, in 1995 [...] He was granted exceptional leave to remain in the UK in July 2001, and subsequently given British citizenship in 2008.""

So he claimed benefits first as a recognised genuine asylum seeker and then as a British citizen. Again, this is a massive failing by the UKBA, not the DWP.

&gt; Adeola Thomas, 38, ran a scam that involved filling out nearly 2,500 claim forms by hand.

&gt;He managed to get £87,000 paid out but was trapped when benefits staff noticed the same address for multiple claims.

&gt; The fraudster, living in Hackney, east London, was arrested at a cashpoint last October while under surveillance by teams from HM Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions.

&gt; Thomas, who had 17 Post Office account cards in ­ different names, was helped by his partner Abimbola Abiola, 34.

This one is a genuine clusterfuck, although it's hard to comment too much as I cannot find anything that accurately describes his immigration status. As I said in an earlier post, many newspapers are in the business of changing 'asylum seeker' or 'refugee', two very legitimate statuses, and turning that into 'illegal immigrant' just because no one will call them out. I can't tell whether or not that's what's happened here without court records.

&gt; AN illegal immigrant and bigamist who was married by the Archbishop of York has been jailed for two and a half years for benefit fraud in London today.

&gt;Ingrid Coipel, 38, claimed job seekers allowance, tax credits, housing benefit, child benefits and council tax benefits for six years up to 2012.

It is very easy
Michael O'Higgins, chairman of the commission, said: ""These are not victimless crimes and some of the fraud found is both blatant and shocking. People are stealing homes, pensions, student loans, parking places and benefits, seemingly confident that no one is tracking them. They are wrong.

""Many of the frauds centre around housing, which is why we are keen to extend the initiative to cover mortgages and insurance.""

Among the frauds uncovered were 157 employees dismissed from public authorities after being discovered to b**e working illegally in the UK after they claimed benefits**. These included 45 staff at Harrow council, some of whom used false identities and have now been deported. Other illegal immigrants were found to be working in hospitals, doctors' surgeries, probation boards and the police. The same investigation led to five market traders' licences being cancelled, one property being seized after a deportation, one right to buy application halted and £70,000 being identified in housing benefit overpayments.
An East London immigration gang responsible for fraudulently claiming over £4 million in state benefits has been jailed for a total of 19 years. 

A major investigation by the UK Border Agency’s criminal and financial investigation team broke up the scam and arrested 9 people during a series of raids across east London in September 2011.

The investigation, involving a number of agencies including HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), revealed that the scam had been operating for 19 years.

Fraud mastermind Ruth Nabuguzi, 49, of Church Road in Newham, used a number of fake identifies to fraudulently claim millions in benefit payments. The stolen money funded a fabulous lifestyle, helping her to build a complex consisting of luxury apartments, shops, restaurants and a hotel in her native Kampala, Uganda.

Nabuguzi created false identities for people she claimed were her children or dependents in order to help them illegally to enter the UK from Uganda and claim benefits.

During the trial it was revealed that Nabuguzi went under the names of Tessie Busulwa, Jane Namusisi and Pauline Zalwango, and made multiple claims for asylum and benefits for herself and others as part of an elaborate scam. She was aided by fellow criminals Dennis Kyeyune, Jordan Sebutemba, Lamulah Sekiziyuvu and Albert Kaidi.

Police and border officers who raided Kyeyune’s home address in Mitcham Road, East Ham, discovered multiple ‘identity packs’ in a plastic bag which had been hidden on top of a garden shed.


 Nigerian illegal immigrant who claimed about £90,000 in benefits has been jailed.

Ingrid Coipel, of Maplestead Road, Dagenham, was sentenced to 15 months on Thursday.

She had pleaded guilty at Snaresbrook Crown Court to nine counts of making a false statement, four counts of using a false instrument and a single count of being knowingly concerned in fraudulent activity.

Allowance

A fraud investigation found that the mother of two, who came to Britain on a false French passport in 2005, was claiming tax credits, housing benefits and council tax benefits between 2008 and 2012.

She also claimed jobseeker’s allowance between 2010 and 2012.

The investigation, led by Barking and Dagenham Council, was launched after Coipel was caught at the Olympic Park in Stratford in May 2012 and charged with possession of a false passport.

For that offence the 38-year-old was sentenced to six months in prison suspended for 12 months.

A Jamaican national living illegally in the UK managed to claim nearly £34,000 in benefits before getting caught.

Nadine Venson appeared at Leicester Crown Court on Thursday after pleading guilty to six benefit fraud offences between 2007 and 2011.

The court heard Venson (39), of Glebe Street, Highfields, Leicester, had worked in factories and for youth projects over the past decade, despite losing her permission to stay in this country in 2000.

The court heard Venson paid her income tax and national insurance but when she lost her job she claimed benefits because she believed she was entitled to them.

Judge Simon Hammond jailed Venson for six months, warning her it was now a matter for the Home Office whether she should be deported back to Jamaica after serving her sentence.

Wednesday February 22, 2012
An illegal immigrant who used a fake passport to scrounge benefits has been jailed for eight months.
Yacine Azouaou, entered Britain in 1999 from France on the undercarriage of a lorry. He then acquired a fake French passport and identity card using the alias Said Fassih.
He was rumbled when the police and council visited his Askew Road home in Shepherds Bush and he showed his French passport as a proof of identification.
The passport was checked with the French Embassy who confirmed that while it was legitimate, the photo inside was different from the one that had been provided to Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council for the purpose of claiming benefits.
In a police interview Azouaou admitted that he had been working under his false name since 2004. He said that he had claimed benefits from August 2011 when he had injured his leg and was unable to work.

I would say the issue in question was the change of football philosophy. Quite frankly the way we played football under Redknapp was fairly good.
