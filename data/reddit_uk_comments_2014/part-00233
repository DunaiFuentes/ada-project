true,ShadowRock9,lfc68,,"Borussia Dortmund are known for playing a counter-attack focused style of football. This means that, when the ball is won back from the opponent, Dortmund try to push towards the opponent's goal as quickly and as directly as possible, committing many bodies forward.

This can be an effective as a style of play as you are attacking the opponent before they have a chance to transit from their attacking shape back to their defensive shape(you just won the ball back, remember?). As a result, there are fewer opponents back to defend, which opens up more space for the counter attacking side to exploit. Also, the defence tends to be less organised due to the relative reaction time against the quick attacks.
However, this must be done with a very specialised set of players, as:
1) the counter attacking side needs to be able to defend and soak the pressure from their opponent's attacks well, as they are looking to tease the opponent into committing more men forward.
2) the counter attacking side needs to have very speedy players, as the entire point of counter attacking is to effectively blitz the opponent before they can even organise their defence; having slow players mitigates the effectiveness of opening up the spaces. 

Hope this helps on a very basic level! ",0,1407781214,null,0,false,0,cjna8xv,t3_2d8u0a,t1_cjna8xv,t1_cjn806o,null,1435184937,9,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,9

Paulinho, he's had a flash or two, but played far more than most players and was largely trash. I can't remember a single goal he scored that wasn't the product of someone making a great assist and he just had to tap it in. 

Neither one should be sold to be fair, but gun to my head, I sell Paulinho. Far less potential than Townsend, not home grown, older, is a luxury instead of a need at his position.

true,[deleted],null,null,"The problem as I see it, is the damage inflicted by the previous market crash, that was largely triggered by an almost incomprehensible influx of raw sensations as stocks and deeds were flung from one bank or fund to the next in a hive of musical chairs, enacted by high speed trading programs, that shareholders couldn't possibly follow, and thus made them all abort simultaneously. 

The easy solution to preventing that - or as I, the humble citizen unacquainted with the frantic and feverous world of the ""Market"", see it - is to place restrictions on the access of domestic assets granted to overseas consumers. I imagine it would be like a light and moderate form of protective mercantilism. We've had more than enough evidence that the free market certainly does not have an omniscient Hand that makes the most rational of decisons because us mortals are incapable of making smart decisions for ourselves. 

I tend to look to Denmark as an example for foreign ownership being restricted, whilst also upheld as a giant of Western ideals and good living. Its against the law for non-native Danish citizens to own property in Denmark. Beach properties and estates in Jutland even have harsh restrictions on who is permitted to live there as a guest. Nobody seems to think of this as an injustice, even though by all means it could be. 

I simply see it, as one who has to work with foreign owners of land in London as an archaeologist, as stability. I always say that land should be leased to foreign owners, and not sold. That goes from upper-middle class doctors and business men looking for holiday penthouses in London for their spoilt children, right up to multinational corporations building factories and regional headquarters. The more land is wrecklessly sold off, the harder it becomes to organise it when local edicts and decisions involve it, such as with the need to survey the land for artefacts and historic remains before development takes place.

The government needs to introduce public transport which is affordable across rural areas.

Cycling should be encouraged in all urban areas as something expected if you live there. some delivery companies in inner city/suburban areas could use bicycles.

the government could introduce bicycle repair into the school curriculum, I would consider it a very practicle way of introducing skills/science etc to young people.
also the government should consider new dedicated cycle paths, special areas where cyclists have priority

And they are typically the hardest hit during not only the worst times of the economy, but also when the economy improves. They are also the least likely group to vote, which makes shitting on them easy.

But I'm also realistic in that I understand that announcing a plan to give money to everyone regardless of their willingness to work is a political suicide.

The basic framework I have suggested here could easily be tweaked and improved upon as a viable option from a purely financial point of view.

The danger in this proposal is that someone goes full slippery slope and has unemployed people go full work fare instead; replacing jobs in places like Tesco and Poundland as soon as they register as unemployed. The current work fare schemes started off for long term unemployed only, and only for non-profits. But have since been opened up by the Tories to places like Tesco and Poundland after only a few months of being unemployed.

And the sad thing about that, is that a hell of a lot of people would vote for that without realising it is taking away their own jobs and filling them with work fare slaves. It's already happening with current work fare schemes, and nobody seems to care about it until it makes the news a couple of times a year.

Bayern pays justifiable fees. You cant justify paying almost 100m€ for Bale if you get Götze for 37m€ or Thiago for 25m€.

In the last 5 years Bayern reached the CL final 3 times and the semi finals once.

The other clubs only reached the CL final once.

Bayern won the double 3 times in the last 5 years aswell. No other club achieved nearly as much as Bayern did.

So its safe to say they were by far the best club in the last 5 years.

No. Its a complete mystery. Some years you will owe them money and other years they will give you loads, then 3 years later request it back.  There doesn't seem to be any published information on how they work out all the factors to come up with a figure so you can check the award your self.

At a rough guess, they will reduce payments now because in 2013-2014 your earnings went over a threshold - and although you are earning less this year (2014 - 2015) you can't claim this until next year.

&gt;

&gt;__Afrikaner Calvinism__ is, according to theory, a unique cultural development that combined the [Calvinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinist) religion with the political aspirations of the white Afrikaans speaking people of South Africa.

&gt;From 1652 to 1835, settlers primarily from the Netherlands, and migrant and refugee Calvinist Protestants from Germany, France, Scotland, and elsewhere in Europe, combined in South Africa to form a distinct people,  called the [Afrikaners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaner). Most of the French progenitors of the Afrikaner people were [Huguenots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huguenot), who first began to arrive between 1687 and 1691 in flight from French government persecution that began under [Louis XIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XIV) and continued for a century.  Between the end of the 18th century and the early 20th century, these people increasingly considered themselves Afrikaner (originally meaning simply ""African"") rather than European. They spoke their own language, called [Afrikaans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans_language), and were bound together by a form of [Calvinist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism) religion. The Afrikaners negotiated a home-rule arrangement in the four British Colonies 10 years after the [Anglo-Boer War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Boer_War) and firmly established themselves as the ruling minority in South Africa until international pressure and increasing chaos within South Africa compelled them to dismantle their policies of exclusive control, called [Apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid).

After Chiriches, he's the best defender Romania has to offer. I realize that doesn't mean much to you though, but you know Chiriches (well, maybe not that much, damn those back injuries) and Gardos is almost as good as him. They are different players. For one thing, Gardos is a lot better at aerial duels. Then, Gardos also doesn't like to dribble that much. He's good with tackling and interception, and he's alright at corners, he scored a few headers for Steaua. 

He is a starter for the National Team and he has experience in Champions League and Europa League. Unfortunately, I haven't seen him play on any other position, I think Steaua tried him a few times as DCM, but it was a bit of a mess, the team wasn't working at that point.

From the little I know about his private life, he's a quiet, nice guy. He is very hard working and he was never involved in any drinking or partying hard scandals.

&gt; How many unemployed people, or people who want to have better work conditions, are there in the world? The answer is significantly higher than the amount that cross borders to resolve it. Therefore, the people who immigrate to the UK are already of a particular character. You're not getting an accurate cross section of the population of where they come from.

&gt; The same applies to the British. There are a small percentage who are willing to relocate for work, particularly when the only things on offer are entry-level jobs. Most immigrants are either moving with family, moving away from something horrendous or are the type of person who can move away from everything and start again. That last one is an incredibly big, scary thing to do, and I don't think it's fair that we're at the point where some people will heavily judge others for not doing this for a £250 a week job.

&gt; [...] Its central character is a ruthless, duplicitous, acid-tongued, lovelorn but often funny spy master named Neil Burnside. He is one of the most fascinating and complex antiheroes ever to have graced the small screen.
&gt; 
&gt; He is the Director of Operations (D-Ops) of Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service. Among his other duties, Burnside oversees a small group of officers who are to be are sent abroad on politically sensitive or dangerous missions: escorting defectors to the West, retrieving secret papers and photographs, or anything too hazardous for the officers the UK has posted to that locale. Burnside’s greatest opposition, however, often comes from the bureaucrats and politicians in his own country, not from the Soviets.
&gt; 
&gt; The Sandbaggers is remarkable for the many ways in which it inverts espionage genre conventions: Burnside doesn’t drink and is about as far from charming as you can get, his top Sandbagger hates violence, no one has any flashy cars or gadgets or sexual liaisons, and the whole series features very few action scenes. A typical 50-minute episode consists of men and women having intelligent conversations and heated arguments in government offices, in London parks, and in the Ops Room, where missions are planned and controlled.

Cesc Fabregas - The creativity he brings was something we were sorely lacking in last season. Ironically, we struggled against organised, defensive teams simply because we lacked the ability to break them down. His passing ability brings a dimension that we sorely lacked last season.


Nemanja Matic - He was exceptional in the latter half of the season last year, and I expect for that to continue. He's far more than our defensive midfielder; he's technically superb and has an eye for a pass. Bear in mind that he's now eligible for us in the Champions League this season, which is a huge plus.


Eden Hazard - We were over-reliant upon him last season, and that reflected in some of the disappointing results. With Oscar off form in the second-half of last season, and without a dangerous striker, opponents often had the liberty to have multiple players close him down at once. I'd expect him to develop more consistency and end product this season, especially if you consider the Summer signings that should benefit him. Filipe Luis provides some much needed overlapping width, and another problem for the opposing right back to deal with (which wasn't an issue last season). Similarly, Diego Costa's proven able to create space for his teammates at Atletico, and I'd expect for him to do the same for Hazard.",0,1407786448,null,0,1407786856,0,cjnd5f3,t3_2d9h5q,t1_cjnd5f3,t3_2d9h5q,null,1435186371,5,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,5

true,lomoeffect,null,null,"**1) How do you think this season will go?**


Better than last season. Matic only arrived in January and had an instant impact, improving our side considerably. We only really struggled against smaller teams that parked the bus - and the signing of Fabregas, and an in form Costa, should help to resolve those problems. I do feel like the media have overrated our chances a little this year, however. We do not have strength in depth like City do for strikers and that will cost us should Costa get injured. Top 2 PL, Semi-Finals CL, and winners of either the FA Cup/Carling Cup.

**2) Which 3 players should other fans watch out for and why?**

Absolute number one is *Matic*. Probably my favourite player to watch in a Chelsea shirt nowadays. He links together the defence and midfield so well and is one of the best players in the PL at regaining possession. We haven't had that much strength in the centre of midfield since Ballack/Essien.

*Fabregas* should also be an important player this season. From what we've seen he'll be playing alongside Matic, and perhaps even Oscar in a 4-3-3. Creating from deep was a big problem against smaller sides in April/May and hopefully he'll make the difference with his range of passing.

*Azpilicueta* was one of the best fullbacks in the league last season (arguably the best). His attitude and workrate was what consistently let him start every game. And deservedly so - defensively, and consistently, excellent.


**3)  If anyone wants to offer a lineup and link it, I will include it.**

2. My three players to watch out for would be:

• Matić- He's a top class DM and I think he will prove his season that he's one of the bet in the world and show that he's on Yaya's level.
• Costa- He's looked really good in pre-season, scoring two great goals. What's impressed me the most about him though is his movement and speed. I never expected him to be so quick! I think that with his strength and speed, he could easily become the PL's top scorer.
• Fábregas - Just like Costa, he's had a great pre-season and scored two great goals. The best part about him though his that he just controls the game. We saw this yesterday against Ferencvaros when he came on as a sub at half-time. First half was dull, showed us how we were last season but then with Fábregas and Costa on the field the team just came to life! I could very well see Fábregas playing a key role in Chelsea's success this season.

true,ThatsMeOnTop,null,null,"Hi, Thanks for asking.

1. It's win or bust. Well, maybe that's an exaggeration, but Mou himself played the 'next season' card all of this season and I think most of us were willing to cut him that slack, particularly as most of us were so frustrated with a lack of options up front.
We've made those important transfers and I think it's fair to say we've got the players we wanted so I think for most fans anything less than a title would be a disappointment. Personally I think the biggest potential obstacle to an effective title challenge is lack of depth, particularly up front. What happens if Costa gets injured, we can't rely on him every game and Drogba and Torres don't really offer good enough back-up. Also, if we're gonna win it, we need Hazard to continue to grow as a player and the likes of Oscar and Willian to be able to turn it on more often.


2. 

a) **Diego Costa:** Our new hitman up top off the back of a good season with Atletico. He seems like the perfect Mourinho player. Lack of goalscoring threat was last seasons biggest single weakness, we're counting on Costa to put that right.

b) **Cesc Fabregas:** He's been one of our best players in pre-season and Chelsea fans are hoping he can replace the hole left by Frankie Lampard in the centre of our midfield. Still haven't quite got used to seeing him in a Chelsea shirt yet.

c) **Thibaut Courtois:** We're in the enviable situation of having two great goalkeepers here at Chelsea in Courtois and Cech. My instinct favours Courtois, and if he continues to develop his game I think he has the potential to be one of the best, if not the best, keepers in the modern game.

All in all, if it all comes together well, we could be scary good. Just need everything to fall into place plus a decent dollop of luck.",0,1407787297,null,0,false,0,cjndmej,t3_2d9h5q,t1_cjndmej,t3_2d9h5q,null,1435186593,1,false,chelseafc,t5_2rsl6,1

true,bchang89,1905,CFC,"1. I think to end the season without a trophy would be a complete failure.  At MINIMUM we need to win the Premier League, based on our squad depth due to our new signings.  Jose often referred us to the ""little horse"" last season, but this season there are no excuses. CL will be a long shot, but I think we can make it to Semi's at the least.

2. Diego Costa - As everyone knows, Chelsea lacked some serious firepower upfront last season.  Eto'o and Ba chipped in some goals here and there, but their performances were not consistent enough for a title push in the end. Torres, nuff' said.  Costa fits into Jose's system perfectly as a powerful center forward who can make timely runs, cool finishing, and can boss opposing defenders. 

Cesc Fabregas - that defense splitting pass surely lacked last season, and Cesc is the man that is up to the task.  He is the creative spark we didn't have in our midfield.  Him paired up with Matic in the back, play as the creative midfielder behind Costa, or even him playing as false 9 makes him extremely versatile and a huge asset to our team.

Eden Hazard - our big time player, tipped to be one of the best of the world, if not already one of the best in the world.  He needs to improve his consistency because towards the end of the season he started fading away a bit.  But this season I think he will be a player to watch because he has matured with two seasons in the PL under his belt, plus there will be less pressure/reliance on him because Costa's presence will take some pressure off of him.

The leisure centre also has lots of kids activities and classes going on as well as the swimming pool.

The shopping centre is a bit 1960's block architecture but with the new tescos &amp; M&amp;S food and other shops it has all you need, there's even a waitrose in sodbury if you're feeling posh. We are about to have a 6 screen cinema built in the centre too.

The trains into Bristol are very frequent but busy at peek times, the train station is easily accessible from all areas of Yate with plenty of parking and bike storage space.

As far as progressive is concerned I know plenty of immigrants living here, true there's not many black faces around and the Indian people I know get stared at a bit but don't receive any hassle to speak off.

Well, as I've said a few times, I don't think you need to be overly optimisitc. In fact I AGREE with you about Townsend. Although not as adamantly, I agree he's suspect and needs to do a lot to prove himself.

Rodgers was familiar with him and he was trying to attract players to a side that was coming off a few rough years.  He has shown flashes of brilliance but they have yet to be seen in a Liverpool kit.  Allen isnt flashy but was a good signing IMO.

To win the Europa League, we'll have to outperform, say, Juventus, Napoli, Benfica, Sevilla, and maybe Basel or Ajax (using last year's CL rejects as the test case).

Which seems more likely?  Personally, I think beating out United and the Merseyside clubs would be more likely than beating out Juve, Napoli, Benfica, and Sevilla.  

Yes, in Europa there is the chance that we get a lucky draw, and that a couple of the big seeded teams knock meet before the semis.  But there's also the chance that we run into an unseeded Fiorentina or a Porto in great form and go out (especially given the away goals rule).

true,liamdpt,EN,england,"1. Last season we fell short by 4 points in the league and came out on top in games against all of our competition, winning all of our home games against them and getting at least a draw against them away. Our problem was beating the smaller teams, we lacked a midfielder who could break down stacked defenses and a striker who could finish opponents off. With both of those problems being fixed in Fabregas and Costa I think the only expectation is to win the league for us. Our team is much better than last season, much more balanced and if Hazard improves on last season even in the slightest the title will be ours.

2. **Hazard** - Was our star player last season and I can only see him getting better. Costa and Fabregas will help lift the weight off his shoulders and let him play his game without the whole club relying on him to produce something magic. Without the added pressure and the likes of Costa and Fabregas to compliment him I think he'll have his best season yet.

**Costa** - We haven't had top striker since Drogba and even though he has returned it is Costa who will transform us. He's very similar to Drogba in a lot of ways, he's big, strong, fast for a man of his size, a bit of a bully and has great technique. Albeit only a friendly but his great solo goal against Fenerbahce shows he can create his own chances when he needs to along with his killer instinct in front of goal to finish the inevitable opportunities being created by Hazard, Oscar and Fabregas.

**Fabregas** Possibly the best at what he does, Fabregas will do wonders for us and will be key to us winning the league. His passing ability and range, his eye for goal and his ability to split defenses are all going to be so important for us. Luckily he will be playing next to Matic who will allow him the freedom he needs to go forward.

I think your ""70% get full time jobs"" situation is not the norm nowadays, and your experience is a pretty unique snapshot of the bigger picture. Of course, I agree of the benefits to employers that exist in the HR department but that is the fault of their HR department. It only takes an hour to get a job advertised on all the major job sites. Separating the decent candidates on virtual paper shouldn't take too long. Interviews should also not take that long with the massive benefit of having the right people doing the interviews.

The HR work that agencies do. At most they collect and categorise CV's. Usually it's just a list of names/qualifications that they collect. Rarely would they call anyone to interview. Most importantly they are terrible as interviewers as they don't know what the right questions are and the qualities candidates should exude.

**All the other HR issues aside**. 

Agencies do exist solely to drive wages down for some businesses. It's the only reason that some businesses use agencies. 

The financial incentives are too much for most ""agencies"" too. They literally are out there trying to drive wages down while trying to get the maximum from employers. Where is UKIP? where is their complaining about foreign agencies driving our wages down?

Agencies have expanded into the high skill sectors and contract sectors too. **LINK:** [Contractors generally hate agencies.](http://www.contractorweekly.com/contractor-news/the-weekly-tea-bag/581-top-4-sneaky-agency-tricks). Contractors are a big slice of highly skilled and small business. From coders to delivery drivers with a van.

Here is a video from Vice that explains one of the scandals (business using cheap labor). It's American but it applies.

I have even heard about the concept of the **""worker henchman""** in N.I. (an agency worker who gets paid a little extra to try and control the other workers and inform the agency of the ""troublemakers"" who are trying to stand up for their rights). I shit you not. I have heard it a few times from friends who are in different jobs. I also suspect I have seen it myself though I am unsure if the ""henchman"" was paid more than the other agency staff. He acted like a ""henchman"" and even let it slip once.. ""he will not be coming back, I'll tell you that much""...because some long term (over a year at least) agency guy refused to work overtime while all of the regular staff were away home. I think he only got 1 day work per week after that until he left. (Found out they were on a 4hour contract)

Season should be very good. I expect the Premier League title OR Champions league title (Both would be incredible). I do hope Jose Mourinho is the manager for at least the rest of his contract, but if he does not deliver either of the 2 titles he will be gone by next summer. But overall this season should a very memorable one with 4 teams contending for the title (including Man Utd)!

2.) **Top 3 Players**

**Diego Costa**: Lack of a striker last season cost us the PL title &amp; the champions league. Hope he has a prolific season. He has shown some nice glimpses in pre-season.

**Cesc Fabregas**: Creativity required after Oscar's inconsistent performances last season. Now instead of always relying on Hazard we also have a proven premier league player with big game experiences &amp; his goals will help to fill the Lampard void. 

**Nemanja Matic**: This guy is amazing. His mental speed (in reading the game) is only slightly outdone by his range of passing. he was extremely impressive last season and his presence was missed in the champions league campaign.Can't wait for his partnership with Fabregas.

true,milesp30,null,null,"**André Schurrle** - Ruthless, quick, and versatile, it took Andre a season to adapt to the Premier League. In reality he had limited chances last season but take his chances he did. In his 8 games started in all competition, he notched 7 goals. He is a difference maker and a clinical finisher (after all he is German). And now, having just had an incredible World Cup personally, he is ready to take the league by storm. Wasting no time for any holiday hangovers, Schurrle begun right where he left off by starting against Fenerbace in Istanbul only two days after returning and putting in a stellar shift. In my opinion he is going to be a crucial part of our set-up and could impress as much as Oscar or Hazard.

**Cesc Fabregas** - By becoming the most hated man in North London, he already got off to the right start with Chelsea fans. After Josh McEachran, Juan Mata, Marco Van Ginkel, it finally looks like we've got a convincing heir to club legend Frank Lampard. Despite not being as box to box as Lampard was, Fabregas has the best passing range than anyone else on the team, scores plenty, and perhaps most importantly- has Premier League experience. He has been- along with Diego Costa- our best player in an underwhelming preseason campaign. Mourinho has come out and repeatedly backed Fabregas to fire and he seems to be  loving life here. Expect 8+ goals, plenty of assists, and a team of the season place for the Spaniard. 

**César Azpilicueta**- I could sit and type you a preview for Diego Costa or Eden Hazard but with them I think its either: You get what you expect or you let them hear about it for the next 5 seasons. So for my last one I chose someone instrumental in our last campaign. Failing to get into the side in the first few weeks of last season, people thought Cesar might not be Jose's kind of guy but a little suspension to Ashley Cole against Schalke and Azpilicueta made the new left back position into his own. Hard-working, quick, and a 1v1 master, ""Dave"" shut down the likes of Jesus Navas, Sergio Aguero, Mesut Ozil, and even Luis Suarez.

For a central midfielder, that's just not good enough.

Hell, he managed to rack up a ton of MotM votes on here for his performance late in the season (I forget against who) just for actually being good defensively for once, when he was responsible for half the times we lost the ball by dawdling on it again.

&gt; Palestine supports Hamas

Palestine has been occupied and what is left is broken into separate entities; the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Hamas is the legitimately elected Government of the Gaza Strip, Hamas Does NOT Represent all Palestinians. Gazan's had their Choices for effective representation limited because Israel deliberately undermined efforts to have a lasting peace with the PLO. In fact they created Hamas to weaken Palestinian unity.

&gt; Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of the Islamist movement in Palestine, returning from Cairo in the seventies, established an Islamic charity association. Prime Minister Golda Meir, saw this as a an opportunity to counterbalance the rise of Arafat’s Fatah movement. According to the Israeli weekly Koteret Rashit (October 1987), ""The Islamic associations as well as the university had been supported and encouraged by the Israeli military authority"" in charge of the (civilian) administration of the West Bank and Gaza. ""They [the Islamic associations and the university] were authorized to receive money payments from abroad.""
&gt; 
&gt; The Islamists set up orphanages and health clinics, as well as a network of schools, workshops which created employment for women as well as system of financial aid to the poor. And in 1978, they created an ""Islamic University"" in Gaza. ""The military authority was convinced that these activities would weaken both the PLO and the leftist organizations in Gaza."" At the end of 1992, there were six hundred mosques in Gaza. Thanks to Israel’s intelligence agency Mossad (Israel’s Institute for Intelligence and Special Tasks) , the Islamists were allowed to reinforce their presence in the occupied territories. Meanwhile, the members of Fatah (Movement for the National Liberation of Palestine) and the Palestinian Left were subjected to the most brutal form of repression.

In 2007 the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert openly accused Binyamin Netanyahu of creating Hamas to counter the PLO.
 
&gt; ""Netanyahu has gone back to being the same old Netanyahu,"" and accused him of directly contributing to strengthening the Hamas movement by releasing the movement's founder, Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, during his term as prime minister. ""Netanyahu established Hamas, gave it life, freed Sheikh Yassin and gave him the opportunity to blossom,"" he said, adding that the current political situation in the Palestinian Authority came about ""because of the nonsense that was done while Netanyahu was prime minister.""

Israel **has no** interest in peace whatsoever, it is a rogue terrorist state; that happens to have the backing of the worlds only superpower. It will sabotage any attempt at peace.

Supporting the plight of the Palestinian people is not indicative of supporting Hamas; that is an absurd leap of logic, if any logic had been applied at all. The resident of Gaza had the rug pulled from under them in terms of democratic choices, the Secular PLO lost control. Israel has cynically used this as an opportunity to collectively punish all Gazans and for that matter all Palestinians.

Whilst we on the subject; Are Hamas evil incarnate? Could they be reasoned with? Here is what they [Say](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/31/comment.israelandthepalestinians)


&gt; Our message to the Israelis is this: we do not fight you because you belong to a certain faith or culture. Jews have lived in the Muslim world for 13 centuries in peace and harmony; they are in our religion ""the people of the book"" who have a covenant from God and His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) to be respected and protected. Our conflict with you is not religious but political. We have no problem with Jews who have not attacked us - our problem is with those who came to our land, imposed themselves on us by force, destroyed our society and banished our people.
&gt; 
&gt; We shall never recognise the right of any power to rob us of our land and deny us our national rights. We shall never recognise the legitimacy of a Zionist state created on our soil in order to atone for somebody else's sins or solve somebody else's problem. But if you are willing to accept the principle of a long-term truce, we are prepared to negotiate the terms. Hamas is extending a hand of peace to those who are truly interested in a peace based on justice.

They are not cartoon villains, they are a natural reaction to an occupying force. They would not be my choice, but they are the democratically elected Government of Gaza. Hamas should **NOT** agree to terms of a ceasefire that will hurt Palestinians more in the Long run. There demands for a truce are [reasonable](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/08/hamas-vows-no-truce-until-demands-are-met-20148912360504741.html)",0,1407790006,null,0,false,0,cjnf3vc,t3_2d980e,t1_cjnf3vc,t1_cjnds9n,null,1435187293,8,false,northernireland,t5_2qlve,8

I post on other forums and the attitude is still there but there is no real line of sight into the disagreement.

SC i think has it handled perfectly....they have the ratings, but they are public....you can disagree and do a drive by ""downvote"" for all intensive purposes but the opinion is still readily available to be seen AND you can see each person who gave a rating. People get called out for drive by ratings all the time (i swear i see it once a day at least, really annoying when i see an alert pop-up and it is for someone calling out a driveby).....on here it is very easy to downvote for whatever reason and move on and people on Reddit HATE, absolutely loathe when people call out downvotes almost regardless of topic, once you start calling out downvotes you become a magnet for more.

Last week there was a guy on one of the threads on SC who picked up something like 50+ ""disagree"" votes (something i have literally never seen on there before)....he had made a statement that basically assured everyone that he was right and they were wrong.  It had nothing to do with the player it was the perceived attitude. Now the discussion continued on because the person who got ""downvoted"" was able to try and address people who downvoted them whereas here the discussion is just surpressed unless you have a rule in RES setup.

I think where you are getting hit on here is the perceived attitude....people on Reddit (not just /r/coys) HATE when someone seemingly dismisses their opinion. You bring up a ton of valid points, and you contribute great points to discussions but there are times where (and i genuinely don't believe it is intentional) your statements come across as ""My opinion is fact and your statement is not so therefore your opinion is less important""....I do not think this is your intent, i think your intent is quite the opposite actually, i think that you try to acknowledge someone else's opinion and then quantify your opinion in a manner for discussion....but it can come off as harsh and be misinterpreted.

Right, which means planning where money can be spent most effectively, not just aiming at easy targets like total miles of cycle path.

&gt; It's exactly having it both ways. Why ask for dedicated cycling provision - which costs money - then continue to use the shared carriageway instead?

It's not the same people doing the asking and doing the riding - or if it is, they're not asking for themselves, they're asking for other people who aren't comfortable cycling on the road.

&gt; I cycle as well. I wouldn't pick this example if I wasn't 100% sure of the weirdness of having the option but not using it.

It does sound odd. It could simply be that once people get used to cycling in the road they get set in their habits.

&gt; They are - in the case of red lights and zebra crossings they're not having to slow down and lose time / energy on their journeys at the cost of safety to others (having nearly been hit three times in the last 6 months by cyclists whilst I crossed pedestrian crossings in my favour - I know what I'm talking about here).

Sure, some cyclists behave badly at traffic lights and crossings (and some drivers do too - I've been nearly hit as many times on zebra crossings in the last 6 months) - but that's a different issue from ignoring segregated infrastructure.

&gt; I do practice what I preach - I don't hop red lights or zebra crossings or weave on pavements amongst pedestrians.

I'm not sure why you're raising this - there are some bad cyclists, but that doesn't mean building cycling infrastructure is pointless any more than the existence of bad drivers means building roads is pointless.",0,1407790420,null,0,false,0,cjnfc5m,t3_2d7wh5,t1_cjnfc5m,t1_cjn8aek,null,1435187401,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,Drugba,MN,mongolia,"**1) How do you think this season will go?**

I think a lot of people have a lot of hope for this season. It's the first time in far too long that we have had any sort of managerial stability, but beyond that, it's the first time in a while that we have a squad that was chosen (or at least approved) by the manager. This is in contrast to our last 4 or 5 seasons where our team felt like glued together group of players brought in to play roles that no longer exist in our current system. You only need to look back to 2012 CL campaign to see that Chelsea do best when everyone has a distinguished role to play and a single goal in mind and under Mourinho we have that.

General consensus among the fans in here is that Mourinho needs to win the league without sacrificing too much in the other competitions. I think most people would consider a season without winning either the EPL or the CL a disappointment. That being said, most people seem pretty confident that we will achieve that goal and maybe even snatch a domestic cup while we are at it.

**2). Which 3 players should other fans watch out for and why? It would help if you can put the 3 names in bold.**

**Hazard:** I don't think much needs to be said about him. Mourinho seems to love him and even when he is having a bad game he is still capable of leaving defenders on their asses. At 23 years old he's starting to get into the prime of his career and he is already tearing up the league. Next season could be very big for him.

**Diego Costa:** Chelsea finally have a striker! There has been a lot of talk about Costa being the next big money flop at Chelsea, but from what we've seen in pre-season, it's looking like he's settling well. He's not afraid to get physical and has surprising pace for his size. With so many creative players behind him, he should have a huge number of chances created for him this season.

**Nemanja Matic:** Often overlooked as he doesn't play a hollywood role, but he's been pivotal to Chelsea since his return. His job in the midfield is pretty simple; get the ball. Matic accomplishes this by being an excellent tackler and using his size to force players off the ball. It's worth noting that he was one of the few players last season who was able to keep Yaya Toure quiet for a full 90 minutes. Last season he was club tied in the Champions League and many Chelsea fans feel we could have done better with him in the squad, so I have added him to this list as he will most defiantly get his CL debut for Chelsea this season.

**3) If anyone wants to offer a lineup via:**

http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=41f32

A couple of things to not about the line up:

I've chosen Cech over Courtois as I feel Courtois will probably be eased into the squad and since he is also carrying a slight injury right now. By the end of the season Courtois could very well be our #1 goal keeper.

Our defense is very up in the air right now. I've gone for players who I'm pretty sure will be starters, but Ivanovic plays CB and LB and Azpilicueta played LB all last season. There a good chance players will be shuffled around for the first few weeks to try and find what works.

I chose Schurrle over Willian in the AR spot only because of Schurrle's good world cup and from what I saw in the last preseason game.

Jose Mourinho typically does better in his second season at clubs (except for his first stint at Chelsea but that was very difficult to top) it takes him a year for him to get the players he wants (and get rid of the ones he doesn't) and for the players to fully understand his philosophy. Due to that I have very high hopes for this season to come. As everyone knows our main problem in recent years was our lack of a goal scoring striker now that we have a beast of a striker named Costa I have a lot of faith that he is the key necessary to save us from those tense moments against packed defences we struggled with last season. I see every player improving this season and working well with the tactics. It's going to be more difficult this season to win the title compared to last season I rate due to everyone massively improving and City staying the beast they are. However I trust in Jose to keep the players passionate and moving forward and fighting hard. We will be competing on all fronts, I see us going far in all the cups and taking the league title to the wire with City with us winning at the end. Our team is a year older and a year wiser and we now have all the necessary pieces together to get that coveted 4th PL trophy.

**2. Which 3 players should other fans watch out for and why?**

**Nemaja Matic** - He's going to be the anchor, the one preventing attackers from getting to our defenders as well as providing composed passes. Not only is he a defensive rock but he is also a calm attacker, he has a good eye for a pass and can make some dribbling runs as well. He was our best purchase last season and has been one of Chelseas best players since then. He has hardly put a foot wrong and always puts in a stellar performance. By the end of the season everyone will be raving about this man.

**Diego Costa** - A feared, passionate bullish striker, something our football club hasn't had in a while. Costa is one of those players who will give it his all no matter the situation. He has a keen sense of goal and despite his appearance is quite pacy and his acceleration can shock opposition players. He makes all the right movements, is a great finisher and great with both feet. A Chelsea team with a competent striker especially one like Chelsea is a must watch especially for those who are so sure he will be a flop. He has his beast moments where he squares up against opposition players which is sure to fire up any match.

**Andre Schurrle** - Coming off a great World Cup where he assisted Germany's final winning goal he is sure to come back in high spirits and hungry for more trophies. He is a very direct winger, not afraid to attack his opponents and shoot for goal. He has great movement and will be sure to drag defenders away from Diego Costa with his fast paced runs. He himself has a keen eye for goal. He has massively improved his set pieces, has a wicked strong free kick and pin point accuracy on corner kicks giving him more options to rack up goals and assists.

Exactly. But I didn't say ''I'm saying nothing'' TOO stir shit, I literally said it because no matter what I said it's gonna be judged on comments today and not on my actual opinion. Literally I was saying ''heres another bunch of guys saying exactly what I just said, yet I'm now on what...-200 downvotes today, and they're being upvoted''. I just posted a link that's Remy swap for Townsend/Kane - I GUARANTEE i'll be downvoted because it's Townsend leaving regardless of how legitimate the article is (caughtoffside, so not very) (EDIT - Yup, someones starting shit in there already)

Everything you've said is spot on. 

I genuinely don't understand how in one day it's gone from being a pretty decent discussion board to now literally nearly as hated as when Judas left us on a free for Arsenal. I don't personally insult people, like I've had to deal with today (i've been called a cunt, faggot, narcissist, xenophobe and my girlfriend a ''thai ladyboy'') and I don't intentionally ''come across'' in any particular manner either. Yet I'm the one in the wrong here, because someone may have misconstrued something I said on the internet? Find me a post where I've personally insulted someone, I dare ya ;) Downvotes I don't care - but I'm being personally insulted by multiple people, and that's okay now just cuz I'm being downvoted? Now maybe you can understand why I've been combative to responses and more venomous in my criticisms of players. 

I just don't sugarcoat things, and it seems that people tend to say nothing or act ''super optimistic'' about players for Karma. I genuinely believe that. It's a thin line - one day it's acceptable to dismiss a player, the next you're sat on -10 downvotes for the exact same thing because when people see someone being downvoted - they want to join in and downvote too. Forums don't tend to work like this, so better discussion takes place and too much emphasis is put on Karma on here in regards to what people say. What they think I bet is totally different - I talk to people on here exactly the same as I talk to mates, or how I talk on other forums and I have NO issues at all. I'm not a rude or arrogant person IRL, and I don't think I come across like that on here. It just feels like people don't like being told that they could be wrong so just spam downvotes. 

The discussions don't really work when you get people downvoting people purely based on their name, regardless of their opinions. Things on here are more personal rather than about discussion because of the Karma situation and now there's some kinda witchhunt against me where everything I post is downvoted instantly. Within 10 minutes. I honestly don't care about Karma, even if it mattered in any real way I have enough of it? But I don't think *anything* I've said today deserved -200 odd downvotes and being insulted as much as I have. Especially considering in the short time I've been here, I've always tried to help with my threads on Youth players and using stats/knowledge of football on topics.

Essentially the way it works is that each sector has a percentage applied and you offset that against what you charge. The benefit really works for businesses where they provide a service so don't have much VAT to claim, i.e contractors.

See 3-5-2, 4-3-3, 4-4-2 diamond last year as an example. He does not have a ""set tactic"" that he prefers to play, he merely adjusts based off his best possible XI, which is what every great manager does. 

Because of Stevie G's long range passing ability from deep in transition as well as playing 2 strikers, Rodgers adopted a much more direct, counter-attacking style of football last year once he decided to shift Gerrard back into the DM role - rather than a more methodical, possession based style that was employed the year before. 

There seem to be two constants in his approach: the first is pressing intently to get the ball back as quickly as possible - this is likely why he bought Borini -  because of his work rate. Joe Allen, another early Rodgers signing, is another example of a player who excels at pressing. Lallana is an example of a recent signing with similar qualities. We saw Markovic track back for the team consistently as well during his 45 min cameo. 

The second constant is the fluidity and creativity that he craves - think about how often we swapped flanks last year during the run of play, how much creative license Coutinho and Suarez were given to roam around, etc. He doesn't require his creative players to maintain a rigid role throughout the game.

true,dirtyewok,num26,,"&gt; But I didn't say ''I'm saying nothing'' TOO stir shit

I know you weren't doing it in an effort to stir shit, but it comes across that way.  If you hadn't said anything it would have avoided things. Saying ""i'm not saying anything"" comes across as trying to engage in stirring shit because it seems like it is asking for a response as to why you aren't saying anything which then leads down a rabbit hole.

The attitude is pervasive across all forums, it is just more visible on Reddit because of the downvotes.  On SC, FightingCock, COYS, SO, JA people will either engage in the conversation or skip on by, on reddit if someone skips on by (for whatever reason) the downvote makes it more noticeable.

If you pay attention on SC you will see people outright bickering and calling people names in threads, but you will see the conversation continue around them because people just can't be assed to deal with it. On reddit its all anonymous, so people will downvote for any number of reasons, but real or imagined if you come across as invalidating a person (or more importantly personS) opinion you will get nailed.  Like i said, i don't think you do it intentionally, quite the opposite...but i think some of your responses can be perceived as confronational or dismissive of an alternate opinion.

As for the article getting downvoted......it has nothing to do with the Townsend link.....it literally has everything to do with caughtoffsides.com...ANYTHING from caughtoffsides gets downvoted and not just on /r/coys....it is among the worst possible sources (truly on par with the pissed fucker at the end of the bar) available and everyone knows it. It will always, always, always get nailed by downvotes.

Nope, but my thread now is marked as Probably Bullshit or something along those lines, but the other caughtoffside articles are fine as is the hertsandessexobserver.co.uk ''source''. I don't rate it either as a source, but how many ''sources'' and news posted is bullshit anyway and doesn't get the same treatment? 

&gt;If you hadn't said anything it would have avoided things

That's literally the answer though, isn't it? That's what I mean - on forums it becomes less about personal vendettas (obviously on FC, SC, GloryGlory there's banter and it exists) but it's nothing like it is on Reddit. Literally, everything I say now will be downvoted. And I refuse to believe that this is *grown men* doing it - it can't be. If it is, they're neckbeards. There, that's my personal attack. I only recently came on here after seeing coys actually existed after Redditing for years and I can see it already.

&gt;__Umkhonto we Sizwe__ (abbreviated as __MK__, [Zulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulu_language) for ""Spear of the Nation"") was the armed wing of the [African National Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress) (ANC), co-founded by [Nelson Mandela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela) in the wake of the [Sharpeville massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpeville_massacre). Its founding represented the conviction in the face of the massacre that the ANC could no longer limit itself to nonviolent protest; its mission was to fight against the South African government.  After warning the South African government in June 1961 of its intent to begin retaliatory acts if the government did not take steps toward constitutional reform and increase political rights, MK launched its first guerrilla attacks against government installations on 16 December 1961. It was subsequently classified as a [terrorist organisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorist_organisation) by the South African government and the United States, and banned.

**Matic** - Came in in January and instantly proved he was one of the best defensive midfielders in the league, if not in the world. I think he will hold Chelsea together this season, allowing Fabregas to get a little bit more forward and help the defence feel settled. His speciality is controlling the midfield and through balls.

**Van Ginkel** - A very versatile midfielder who didn't get his chance last season due to a serious injury. I think with all the games we will have to play he will get quite a few games this season. He can play attacking mid and deeper much like Fabregas. His speciality is long passes. 

**Schurrle** - I think he will be used often against the smaller teams to give a cutting edge to the attack. He can run very well onto through balls from Matic/Fabregas and also is a good finisher. He will be full of confidence after the world cup and I expect to see him used on the right more. Speciality is running onto the ball and pace.

No of course not - which is why I included: 

&gt; His attitude and workrate was what consistently let him start every game. 

In my opinion he had the best attitude out of any player last season (which is why he probably won players' player of the year) and that attitude was exactly how he managed to force himself into the team. As long as that's there, and his performances are as good as they've been in the past, he'll be starting every match.

However, and this relates to the last bit of your post, he may not always be starting at RB. I'm not entirely convinced on Luis for us *so far*, but that is admittedly based off very little matches (and those matches have been pre-season friendlies which really do not count for much at all), so it isn't out the question that Mourinho will just do what he did last season and play Azpilicueta on the left and Ivanovic on the right.

Perhaps Azpilicueta isn't a player to watch as such, because the majority of people know just how good he's been in the past, but I did feel like picking someone else over Hazard.

&gt;Then you're missing the point - even if we established it at 10% or 50% we'd still need to look at the nature of the journey being made. 

I'm not, and we wouldn't. You're attempting to obfuscate a very simple point. 

A pitiful amount of journeys are made by bicycle. Some of these cannot be made by bicycle because they require heavy loads, or because of the distance involved or whatever.

 It's actually a bit frustrating that you count 'being sweaty' as a valid reason not to use the bike. Motorised transport emits toxic and deadly fumes that  [cause nearly 5,000 premature deaths each year.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17704116) and a good few thousand deaths from accidents, never mind all of the crippling injuries. There's also the widespread effects of lung diseases attributed to particulate emissions from vehicles. But yeah, by all means, keep using cars because an alternative might make you a bit sweaty.

Nearly 80% of journeys are under 10 miles and and more than 55% are under 5 miles (source - 2004 National Travel Survey by DFT) Even being exceedingly generous and saying that 50% of those journeys *couldn't* be made by bike for a variety of reasons, that's still literally millions and millions of journeys per year that could be made by bike. There is huge room for improvement.

What's even more frustrating is that there are plenty of other countries that have shown us exactly how it needs to be done, and our leaders and politicians readily admit this. They love to pay lipservice to the dutch and danish systems.

Skrtel is great at using his body, tackles hard, wins a lot in the air, only problem is tactical discipline and if that is sorted by his partner then he is better than Sakho currently (and Lovren seems to have played left side most of his career).


Hendo-Gerrard-Cou. 2 of those 3 are obvious, the third due to his creativity and new found pressing and tactical awareness on the defensive side since the turn of the year. 


Sterling-Sturridge-Lallana. Again 2 of those 3 are obvious, but Lallana is currently more well rounded than Lazar, for me he comes in with complete understanding of the system with his balance of creativity and pressing, his ability to move from wide to midfield (and have Cou move up) would allow us to conserve the energy of the team for longer (is also top 5 players who ran most last season). Lazar will hopefully come on and develop as the season goes.


Before the season started Coutinho, Sterling, Sturridge and Hendo were our best players, cut out from the rest, then we had solid players in Skrtel, Gerrard, Migs (solid weekly contributers). We don't know what will happen, but I would think at least 2 more players and hopefully 3 or more will join the list of our best players. But other than those 4 I feel everyone can somehow be benched and the team would still have it's style and tempo. Coutinho on the penetrative passes, Hendo on the pressing, Sterling and Sturridge on the quick counters. We could shuffle the rest of the players and still maintain this current system. The ones I think will also join them in becoming vital for this system are potentially improved Flanno/Javi and Moreno if he comes, and for me at least most certainly Lallana and Lovren. One who complements the attacking and pressing side, the other finally sorting the much needed defensive line problem. We will be able to sub different players, but these players will become the core of our system. Can, Sakho, Skrtel, Migs will all have roles, as will Gerrard etc. but they aren't tailor made for our style. For those wondering why Can isn't on the other list, I feel he has great future ahead, but we don't have style that is built around vertical attacks from midfield, his greatest assets are not through passes or high pressing. We will open up space for him to make his runs from deep, but we aren't built around midfielders that run straight through ala Yaya. Coutinho and Sterling make most of our runs with the ball from deep and they aren't like Can who uses his power runs, they are very agile and move too quickly for the defenders to mark them, Hendo passes and runs past the defensive line. He will obviously improve us and will most definitely have an easier transition to our system than Coutinho who had to put on muscle and learn defending.",0,1407796436,null,0,false,0,cjnihd7,t3_2d9pko,t1_cjnihd7,t3_2d9pko,null,1435188883,3,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,3

true,xBiGSTE,EN,england,"**1. How do you think this season will go?**

I don't think our squad is as stacked as everyone seems to think. A few injuries to our CB's and up top and we're stuck fielding youngsters and Torres in key positions. Compare that with City who have 4 world class strikers on their books and you can see my point. That said our first 11 is formidable. If we can keep everyone fit or strengthen further in those positions, then I can definitely see us winning the League with a deep Champions League run as well.

**2. Which 3 players should other fans watch out for and why?**

**Oscar** - Completely under-appreciated by some in our fan base. The work he does off the ball isn't pretty but is essential in doing well at the highest level. He can make the difference going the other way as well. Should he re-capture his attacking form from the first half of last season and sustain it across the entire season, he can easily become one of the most complete midfielders in world Football. He should make up a midfield triangle with **Fabregas** and **Matic** that gives us the perfect blend of power, work ethic and technical ability.

**Hazard** - A magical player, the kind that makes you fall in love with the game all over again. The way he just explodes into life, skipping past players like they're not even there is amazing. With Costa and Fabregas coming in to spread the attacking burden and Filipe Luis overlapping, we should see less of the double teaming on him that became common place toward the end of last season. Giving Eden more space to do what he does best.

**Schürrle** - An absolute machine, will compete with Willian for his position. I do expect Andre to feature more often though. He offers us something different. Incredibly pacey, direct and with a rocket of a shot, almost Balesque. He can become one of our primary goal threats. Backs all that up with an excellent attitude, a willingness to track back and a real enthusiasm for the club.

**3. If anyone wants to offer a lineup and link it, I will include it.**

true,deadmau5isgod,1905,deutschenglish,"1. I think this season could be very successful if we sign another striker. Unfortunately, if Diego gets an injury we rely on Torres (sigh) and Didier (who I love with all my heart). Neither is a world class striker anymore and this could be what shatters our season. However, I'm still confident because we will have Matic for the entire season + a striker who can actually score.  
2. - Nemanja Matic. I believe that he is the most important member of our squad. An absolute rock in midfield and yet to have a bad game. As I said earlier, having him for the entire season is crucial.  
 -Eden Hazard. He's been excellent for us ever since we've signed him but we relied on him too heavily last season. This season with a better squad and **less strain and reliance** on him, he will be able to develop even more and shine as usual.  
 -Diego Costa. For the first time in a while, we have a world class striker. With the way our team plays, I'm confident that he will be able to be among the top scorers of the premier league this year. Last season, we would've won the league if we had better finishing and this is what Diego will bring. Should he be injured though, it will spell trouble for us. As I said earlier, I still feel another striker is required. Remy / Bony would be very good buys.

He scores goals which is important. Right now if Sturridge gets injured we only have Lambert and Borini. Borini is probably gone soon, but even if he doesn't leave I haven't seen him perform in any way that would make me think he can fill the central striker role. 

I have faith in Lambert but who knows how that will go. We need another option, period. He won't cost much, therefore he won't prevent us from making other signings if someone else becomes available.

Now if you're backing it up with facts -  that's just having a strong opinion. Nor do I go around downvoting everyone who disagrees with me like now, where every single post I make is 0 within 5 minutes max. 

I've watched Townsend for 5 years. I've seen him at Yeovil, at Orient and I think he found his level at QPR. He hit one fluke goal in 25 games. He concedes possession with stupid shots. He lacks the mentality to ever reach that top level, despite having some good tools under his belt. He lacks what you can't teach, that natural instinct and he will *always* revert back to what he's used to. If he was 18? I'd agree. But he's 23 - and in footballing terms, that's getting on now. 

I've said all this in the past time &amp; time again - how is that not being reasonable? If you have an opinion on a player, you don't magically reverse it or feign optimism just for some Karma points. I just feel strongly that for a fluid, potent front 3 you can't have Eriksen, Lamela and....Townsend. I've said in the past he'd be a decent backup/squad player if he's willing to stay, be he's never gonna be Robben one day. If we can get 10+ million for a back up player while he's hot - we take it. Many people agree with that - hell, even people who have called me a faggot agree with that. 

Now in any of the earlier discussion threads, find me a post where I've been a prick to someone over this. You can't, I haven't. I even said, maybe Poch could take him aside and sort him out just 3 or so days ago. But when you have the potential to upgrade, you upgrade.

&gt;__Gower__ or the __Gower Peninsula__ ([Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language): *Gŵyr* or *Penrhyn Gŵyr*) is a [peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsula) in [South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Wales), projecting westwards into the [Bristol Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Channel), and administratively part of the [City and County of Swansea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_and_County_of_Swansea_council). In 1956, Gower became the first area in the United Kingdom to be designated an [Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_of_Outstanding_Natural_Beauty).

And why should you pay for it? .....Well.....I can't speak for you, but I can for the tax payer In general...

The net benifit of cycling benifits everyone (even those who don't cycle), your kids could cycle to school, obesity and diabetes have the potential to drop massively. Other effect like congestion and air pollution would also be lowered. The saving to the NHS would be astronomical.

People who say stuff like ""why should my tax £££ pay for cycle lanes"" miss the point. It's not about cyclists, it's about people and potential cyclists. And it's not ""my cycle lane"",  it's yours, your kids etc. It's about safer roads, healthier nation, better standard of living....more money in your pocket etc.

It is not about keeping a handful of current cyclists happy. It's about planning for a future that does not involve more roads, more cars and more unhealthy people.

I thought Tadic and Clyne down the right did look quite dangerous, and I had the feeling that if a cross from the right or left had beaten the first man then Pelle might actually have stuck his head on it. 

Pelle himself looked decent enough - good touch for a big guy, but as most are saying didn't actually make the most of the (admittedly not fantastic) service he got. He lost the ball quite deep in his own half a couple of times which we clearly can't afford to happen against the likes of Liverpool. Obviously the Leverkeusen defence is a real step up from the Eredivisie.

Isgrove looked a bit short on quality for this level, but only time will tell. On the other hand, most other academy grads have slotted in pretty seamlessly. Bertrand was perhaps a step slow on a couple of moves, but was fairly solid defensively, and obviously hasn't had the chance to gel with a left-winger as yet. I did like the look of Taider a lot when he came on, and Ramirez did look in the mood. 

Yoshida was truly dreadful - seemed to make small mistake after small mistake which will obviously add up. Sorry. Fonte was, as always, pretty excellent.

true,RifleEyez,null,null,"Soldado has already proven himself though. He's got an undeniable record, and has a natural finishers instinct. His problem isn't improving so I don't think it's comparable in the same respect. 

I wouldn't say the basis is flawed and my entire dismissive attitude is unwarranted. Late blooming is pretty rare, especially for wingers who I feel tend to peak much quicker than obviously goalkeepers, defenders, playmakers and even poachers. I've seen Robben mentioned, but at 23 he was tearing the EPL apart as part of the Duff/Robben EPL winning combo. I can't really think of many players in similar roles at top quality/top 6 (top 4 that we're aiming for) that have bloomed so late. The fact I can't remember many suggests statistically it's a rare occurrence and Townsend hasn't had a long term injury/no gametime/crazy position change either that could be an excuse. I feel like I have to keep saying ''I'm not being condescending here...'', which I shouldn't have too - but can you name me any in this day and age that have? And then compare that to the ones who were showing huge promise at 18/19. 

For Townsend, he just seems to lack exactly what you described and more. I feel with him, it's just so deeply embedded that he will never improve. During the heat of the moment, during those split second choices, it's extremely difficult to coach that natural 'weakness' out of a player. The same way certain players just have certain traits that are impossible to coach out of them, or they revert back to their ''old ways'' when things aren't going their way. It's not at all uncommon for players in similar roles to suffer from that - there's an endless amount who have that natural flair, technique but just don't have *it*. You're suggesting he can gain it, i'm suggesting he can't. Why does that make me condescending in any way? It's just a differing opinion. 

He had his chances, it's not like he's some kid who played a bit part role. If he's happy being a squad rotation, then sure. But he's not part of the Eriksen, Lamela, ??? attacking 3 in the future. To me, it just seems like people have Spurs tinted glasses on. He's loyal, he's an academy boy and people let that skew their impression of him. If he played for another team, and scored 1 in 25, would we be as keen to sign him up? Think of it from that point of view. Do I want him to become a Loyal Robben? Yes. Do I want him to be more productive, of course. Do I think he will? No. The academy should produce future stars, yes - but it's also to produce a profit. Why couldn't we work on Livermore more if he had a few things to iron out? Why not Caulker? It's money - and 10/15m is hard to turn down.

There will never be a good time to redistribute wealth if you ask the rich, but the reason we have progressive taxation is because we *did* ask them - social welfare services were adopted in this country as a sop, because our establishment didn't fancy the revolutions which devastated France and Russia.

The children of Bud and Sam Walton have, between 6 of them, more combined wealth than 41% of the US population, 49 million families.

I'm sure the inequality isn't quite as striking in the UK, but it's along similar lines.

The reason ""we have no wealth to tax"" is because we've allowed a global super-elite to offshore their assets beyond the reach of the taxman.

I'm not saying I have a quick and easy answer to that last part, but trying to characterise taxation as ""theft"" is truly bogus.

The defense, while upgraded, the reality of it is Caulker, Onuoha and Simpson are our only defenders under 30 worthy of a spot on the first team.  Maybe Suk-Young too but I'm afraid his defensive awareness is not quite there.  And Traore, you can count him but, he'll likely be playing wing back along with Simpson, who I've actually already counted but, is that even a position he can play?  Next defender up.  Hill, Dunne, Ferdinand... How long will this trio last in the top flight?  The midfield would certainly need another player as well.  I actually think we are strongest in midfield now, with Faurlin, Mutch and Isla fit to play.  The true achievement at the club over the past season has been the spirit in the dressing room.  There is no arrogance, the squad knows they have to work hard to earn results.  Second to that, the influx of domestic and not foreign players will be a benefit to the squad long term.

Don't get me wrong I'm not saying we are not a solid side, it is just that we are skating on thin ice.  An injury or two above normal conditions and we could have a serious problem, in any position.  That is what happened during our last season.  We ran low of players, too many injuries, especially at striker.  I feel the same could happen this year as well, but who knows, maybe we'll get lucky with injuries.  We need to pick up a striker, I haven't seen a single one linked to us this window that looked a better player than Austin.

The squad Mourinho has at his disposal is now much more suited to his style than the one he picked up from Di Matteo/Benitez. More importantly, it is a lot stronger.

His anchorage in the midfield means that the incredibly successful Chelsea defence (fewest goals conceded last season, 27, City were second with 37) will only get harder for opposition to score against. **Fabregas** has been a fantastic replacement for the departed Lampard, as sad as it was to see him go.

true,unethical_pirate,null,null,"&gt;There will never be a good time to redistribute wealth if you ask the rich, but the reason we have progressive taxation is because we *did* ask them - social welfare services were adopted in this country as a sop, because our establishment didn't fancy the revolutions which devastated France and Russia.

 Completely agree with that, it was to pacify the masses particularly after the 1886 London roits, but at the inception on the welfare state. It wasn't as a cradle to grave uncerstainable levels we're at today. It was for those who were hard working. The problem today is there isn't the opportunity to work your way out of poverty because of the huge burden of the state and it's monetary policy.

 We went from the largest empire in modern history which was possible because of a free market, innovation and sound money to socialist nightmare. It will come crashing down there's no other option. 


&gt;The reason ""we have no wealth to tax"" is because we've allowed a global super-elite to offshore their assets beyond the reach of the taxman.

To bring it back the article, there is some significant tax dodging going on but it's no where near enough to cover the amount we're spending. Raising the taxes would just lead to more of this. Not raising the taxes means we get further into debt and have to print money to pay for it. Devaluing the Pound and forcing more people to these under the table deals to survive because of raising prices . It's a double edge sword. 

&gt;I'm not saying I have a quick and easy answer to that last part, but trying to characterise taxation as ""theft"" is truly bogus.

If people didn't characterise it as theft why wouldn't they just pay it? Doesn't it show that people don't want to hand it over. Having something that you don't want to give up, taken by the force of the state is theft.  If people got a would you like to pay tax yes or no tick box on their pay slip what would they choose? 


I've enjoyed our decision. I'm going to call it night.

To rephrase: they are episodes that show Doctor Who's ability to excel in the combination compact storytelling with philosophical underpinnings/mind-bending concepts.

I recommend these particular ones because they don't require much context, though indeed that's because they don't contain many typical Who villains, characters, or tropes.

true,theretheremrmagpie,null,null,"I'd have to disagree with your claims about Rose.  That conversation in the diner was inspiring to me and demonstrative of why she is one of the best companions in New Who (and my personal favorite).  She may come off as immature and selfish, but I think it's unfair to say that because she was acting to protect the Doctor and not Earth she has ""tenuous ties to her own home.""  Love of the Doctor is what brings out the best in all his companions and what inspires them to do good.  He leads by example and so in a way, all good deeds that his companions do are tied to him.  I think her speech in the diner showed Rose's passionate, uncompromising dedication to the principles that the Doctor taught her:  if you can do something for someone you love, you do it, period.

Which brings me to why I think Amy should be further down on the list.  If you look at all the other companions, you see a pattern in how they interact with minor characters.

Essentially, the case against him can be summed up this simply:

his wife's job is to provide a pretty face on TV shows; one month after they were married, she went and worked on a TV show called The X Factor.

For his condemnation of 'vapid eye candy', see this clip:

http://youtu.be/AM-QB8cXWtM?t=4m1s

'The least meaningful job in the universe.'

And he married that.

Observe this critique he gave of The X Factor (before his wife went and worked there, of course):

'A home for the mentally ill.'
'A futuristic fascist rally.'

Think about it: The last time he had a midfield that was THIS offensive and created this many chances, he won the treble with Barcelona and scored 30+ goals. 

I don't expect 30+ goals. I do think though that if we needed a veteran striker proven in Europe who can mentor Sturridge (who could benefit from Eto'o's knowledge of positioning and finishing) and start 20+ games next season without being relied upon exclusively, he'd be a fantastic choice.

Even with those two points considered, however, there are still enough potential variations on those themes that I can't see it being any more than a lucky guess. I could be wrong though, I suppose.

The X Factor has no relevance to their relationship whatsoever.

I think the main problem is that people seem to have always taken his exaggerated persona as totally representative of who he is.

Lloris
Naughton - Kaboul - Dier - Rose 
Capoue - Holtby 
Lennon - Lamela - Eriksen 
Adebayor 

Defense: 
Rose has looked excellent of late, and Davies although good, could use some more time to bed in with the squad. Dier looked good, and due to injuries for Chiriches, Vertonghen with no recent game time, and Dawson with poor performances, I can see Poch making a bold move. Naughton and Kaboul are obvious choices I'm sure for all of us. 

Midfield:
Capoue and Holtby based on performance alone. Paulinho played a poor world cup and hasn't played recently with the squad, Sandro is about 85% there, but still needs some work to unseat Ettiene. Bentaleb looked class in preseason, but I can see him coming on for Holtby, IF he gets worn out late in game, otherwise he will most likely come on for Capoue if Sandro isn't deemed ready. 

Attack: Nothing else needs be said other than Townsend coming on for Lennon toward the 65/70 minute mark for a late injection of speed and attacking intent. Adebayor has outplayed Soldado, and unless they can somehow coexist with 2 up top and produce, it should probably be Ade up front for a majority of the season because he is more complete than Bobby (don't get me wrong though, we all love him still lol) 

EDIT:
Subs:
Bentaleb - - &gt; Capoue 65'

true,sopleme06,null,null,"I'm an American who lived and studied abroad for 7 months at Swansea University.  I did my study abroad in 2010, so some of my information might be a little outdated.  Please keep in mind that this is a foreigner's perspective.

I can probably type an essay about the nightlife at Swansea.  Most (if not all) of the nightlife is located on Wind Street.  Wind Street is actually pronounced ""Wine"" Street.  I'm not sure if that's how the Welsh pronounce it or if it's nicknamed that for the benders that take place there.  There are many dance clubs but a lot of them seemed to tailored to 16-22 year olds.  I'm not sure where the older crowd hung out at. 

Other than the great nightlife, the city is absolutely stunning.  The beach is gorgeous across from the University.  A 20-30 minute bus ride will take you to the Gower which looks like a picture from some travel magazine.

As far as demographics and diversity goes, there wasn't much.  Most of the people that I met were Caucasian.  Swansea kind of reminded me of the Jersey Shore a little bit where a lot of the guys and girls were a little darker skinned with dark haired.  A lot of the guys look like cast members right out of the Jersey Shore (sorry if this offends anyone).  However, I've rarely came across anyone that was rude or someone that wasn't helpful.  Everyone that I met or asked for directions and was super helpful. 

I'm not sure if this is true or not, but it seems like Swansea has a rep for having a bad drug problem.  Check out the documentary ""Swansea Love Story"" which documents some of the struggles people go through that live in Swansea that deal with addition.

Let me know if you have any more questions - like I said above, I could write an entire essay about my experiences at Swansea.

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"Wages are huge expenses, that's why. A guy on 100k per week over a 4 year contract costs £20 million. That's as much as Markovic cost, yet there is no equity, so to speak, in wages as opposed to transfer fees.

The issue is that our bank books can't take paying guys like Eto'o 100k per week when they most certainly won't contribute that much to the side. Guys on Liverpool that should be making that kind of money are the players who have contributed already, not the ones who we are bringing in and have yet to contribute. When you are not pulling in the profits that people think (where's /u/rydleo to explain the exact number when you don't feel like Googling) and instead are losing small amounts of money (I want to Liverpool lost around ~£15 million in 12-13) you can't afford to spend £5 million paying Eto'o or £10 million if he signed on a 2-year deal, plus whatever agents fees we'd have to pay.

Further, there are plenty of players here now and players who have been here before who you know/knew aren't worth their wages. Right now I can think of Johnson, Coates, Kolo, Agger and Kelly as players who are earning based on potential that didn't develop or form they haven't shown for a while. In the past, Joe Cole, Downing and Carroll were all on massive wages and everyone knew it while they were here.

true,DavidLuiz4,present,Didier Drogba,"Something happened behind the scenes and Ray Wilkins the assistant coach was sacked by the board in the middle of Carlo's second season. Wilkins and his wife were extremely respected by the squad at the time, and this probably had a negative impact on the dressing room. 

In addition to this, Chelsea had cut the wage bill releasing huge figures like Ballack, Joe Cole, and Deco etc without really replacing them with similar experience. Ramires I believe was bought that season and he took a long time to really settle in, so we struggled for depth and leadership that season when injuries and illness began to happen to players like Drogba who had been struggling with Malaria. These two issues led to a slump in form in the second season with poor sluggish play that showed no signs of improving. 

Finally on top of that, Carlo was not having success in Europe and the CL was the holy grail at that point. We were eliminated and outplayed pretty convincingly by Jose's Inter who went on to win it either that season or the previous season. 

I think the board's premature attempt at integrating youth players at the cost of experience really backfired that season and cost Carlo his job. Everyone who is always screaming for experienced pros to be cut to make room for Bamford, Boga, Ake, whoever should remember this.

By this I mean, what university you'll get in to (assuming you are a top tier student that obtains very high grades) will solely depend on the final exams you take. Remember there are no resits whatsoever, so if you are feeling bad or stressed or have any external factors that affects your exam attempt, then you are screwed for life.


Also the exams aren't really getting any harder, just the grading system has changed a bit. The top university places have already started taking advantage of this - Oxbridge, UCL, Warwick, LSE, etc, are now offering places based on percentage grades, For example, to do Maths in Cambridge they're asking for 95% or more for FP1.


This will get more and more ridiculous with the current system. The only way to solve grade inflation would be to undo Tony Blair's stupid changes where A levels were dumbed down to get more students into university.

Various seasons 3 through 7 spoilers ahead.

In DotD, Clara, the Doctor, the Doctor, and the Doctor attend the Doctor's wedding with Queen Elizabeth. Ten remembers getting married in The End of Time Part 1, but doesn't remember meeting the Doctor... mostly.

When the time thing appears, Eleven remembers that ""this is where [he] come[s] in."" Kind of remembering events when they happen, but not remembering what's going to happen. It doesn't seem as though he remembers meeting Clara either, so there are some things that he can't retain when it's too intertwined with his own timeline.

Of course, this isn't always the case, it's not so black and white. When 5 meets 10 in Time Crash, 10 is momentarily surprised, but then remembers how to resolve the situation because he remembers how he did it.

I like to think it's something to do with what is required for a stable time loop. There are realities where the Doctor remembers where he shouldn't, and changes time, causing paradoxes.

Brave Katrina Mooney stumbled across the armed robbery attempt as she entered a Wallasey newsagents.

CCTV footage recorded her berating the offender and pulling him away from the shop counter – eventually forcing him out of the shop.
Despite being confronted with a weapon Mrs Mooney said she felt no fear as she made him abandon his plan to rob News Plus in Trafalgar Road.

Speaking to the ECHO, Mrs Mooney, who works in a shop herself, instead revealed her first reaction was to protect the girl being threatened.

The 39-year-old mum-of-two who also has a grandchild, said: “I was going in the shop to get something and that’s when I saw her and heard something was going on.

“He was just staring at me, he didn’t say anything until he got over the road and then he said he would be back for me.”

Asked if she had been scared at any point during the incident, she said: “That thought never even entered my head, I was just trying to protect the girl. I had already seen the knife but he was waving it around a lot, but then as he went to walk out the door he waved the knife and I just said: ‘Get out’.

“I said: ‘What do you think you are doing threatening young girls with a knife – get out’.

“When I grabbed him the first time, he pulled away from me and I just pulled him out. I just wanted him outside the shop.”",0,1407818035,null,0,false,0,cjnsvbv,t3_2db2l5,t1_cjnsvbv,t3_2db2l5,null,1435193911,1,false,Liverpool,t5_2r21z,1

It's actually really neat to see how each Doctor changes over the course of their era's, and how that leads into the next Doctor, although that's obviously not always intended as such. The first Doctor's progression was explained above, and that lead to the second Doctor, who was finally capable of really loving his youthful adventuring again, someone who mostly just wanted to have fun exploring the universe with some friends he actually saw as equals (most notably Jamie), while fully taking on the role of Earth's (and other worlds') protector. At the end of his time he was basically executed for having too much fun/tampering with time too much by the timelords, and banished to earth while his Tardis was sabotaged. The Third Doctor was very grumpy, far less warm towards the people around him. He was stuck up, even angry at times at being banished to this planet after tasting that ultimate freedom in his previous incarnation. The love for earth and humanity wasn't gone, and he continued helping the people of earth, but shades of his earliest self (that we've seen at least) came back - a man who felt above us, as a lower life form. Again, towards the end of his era, especially after the arrival of Sarah Jane and the Timelords granting him the power to travel the universe again, that warmth came back, and he allowed himself to get just a bit closer to others. Then came Tom Baker, who again fully embraced the freedom to do as he pleased. Still a man who wasn't afraid to come across as arrogant, or as feeling better than others, he was much closer to his friends, sometimes even seeming as a kid in a somewhat charmingly childish romantic relationship with his girls (again, most notably Sarah Jane, and later Romana 2). The fifth Doctor kept that warmth and love, but matured somewhat. Much calmer than the fourth, more thoughtful, less eager to make fun of everyone around him. The fifth Doctor got back to the arrogant part of the Doctor's persona, angry at the endless arrogance and interference of the Timelords and at not being taken seriously by most people he met. He was loud and bombastic, wearing an outfit that would insult pretty much everyone he came across and he didn't give a damn. He was cold and insulting towards his companions, almost never showing true feelings of caring - only when he really needed to. You could almost say he was having a mid-life crisis. Seven was again a little bit older, a little bit wiser in his interactions with others. He truly cared about the girl he took under his wing, acting like a caring teacher for her. While warmer and more willing to listen to those in need, he did keep that dark edge of the previous Doctor towards those he perceived as evil, and wasn't above some dirty tactics. He wasn't as patient as he'd been in the past with the forces of evil. 

The more modern Doctors' progression is a bit more spelled out for us, from the giddy, romantic 8, to his decision to become a warrior with the Hurt-Doctor, the guilt-driven 9 after the war who sacrificed himself after finally learning to enjoy and love again, to 10, the romantic Doctor, who still battled with his demons but thrived on that old lust for adventure and enjoying the company of women, to 11, who was more childlike in ways, but also showed his age and weariness at times.

Basically, 4 out of 20 teams in the EPL get Champions League... 1 in god knows how many teams get it out of winning Europa.  The odds are massively stacked against us.

Then you have to factor in the fact that for a lot of teams in Europa, there is never going to be a better chance of winning silverware of getting that UCL spot.  So they'll put their whole focus on it, happy to finish mid-table elsewhere.

Then there's the whole 3rd placed UCL group teams dropping down.  We'll end up having at least a handful of sides in there that are genuinely better than us, both of paper and in Cup competition experience.

Then you've got the fact that to win a Cup, you need a huge slice of luck.  A bad pitch, shit ref, freak goal, spate of injuries, crazy weather... all can knock you out in an instant, regardless of whether you've been the better team over two legs or not.

I think ultimately, our aim is to get 4th spot on a semi-regular basis in the Prem, not qualifying for UCL by winning Europa every year or two.  So why not focus on our real aim?

With Costa and Fabregas and more time to gel for last year's starters, it can be expected that Chelsea will tone down the defensive attitude but it is still entrenched in the mourinho philosophy.

Players to watch out will be Courtois, Matic and definitely Costa. Courtois need phenomenal performances to completely relegate Cech to the bench. It will be an interesting battle. Matic can only improve from last season. Because of Matic our CL team also improves. Matic had brilliant performances last year especially the game at Etihad and he'll be the core of the team this season.

Costa has a lot of weight on his shoulders, too. If Torres had the weight to prove he's worth 50 mil, Costa has the weight to prove he'll not do a Torres. He's had a positive preseason. Fans are finally believing this season we will start scoring.

If you're of a certain age in this country you'll find most social activities in our society revolve around drinking alcohol in some way.  You're almost expected to drink it in order to be able to participate - otherwise your list of activities becomes extremely limited.  

I know this because of a past and current bout of stomach ulcers/gastritis I've had/have.  I've found myself in social isolation because I can't tolerate being out in the town centre at 2 in the morning stone-cold sober.  I've even gone to great lengths to *try* and drink on a few occasions just to avoid going insane with loneliness - with it backfiring and me throwing up and being really ill for a week.  

So yeah - I've essentially knowingly made myself *more ill* just for a chance to ""join in"" and not have to say no to *every single invitation* to do something with my friends.  When our culture of social participation is so heavily based on alcohol, warnings seem kinda pointless to me.  

Seriously - what are people gonna go with?  Enjoy an almost entirely-alcohol-based social life with friends or look at the warnings and go ""nah I think social isolation is best for me, I don't need to talk to any *people* anyway"".

It would make much more sense to consider Pochettino's Southampton system flipped down the middle. Then Walker is the Shaw equivalent, with Davies on the left offering something more akin to the more disciplined performances seen by Clyne and Chambers on Southampton's right.

If you carry that notion further forward, the goal-scoring wide forward on the left (Rodriguez) becomes a goal-scoring wide forward on the right, perfect for Lamela, backed up by Townsend. The roving wide right/number ten creator (Lallana) becomes a roving wide left/number ten creator, perfect for Eriksen if he works hard enough, backed up by Holtby, perhaps even Ceballos. The strong and hard-working advanced central midfielder/wide right hustler (Davis) becomes a strong and hard-working advanced central midfielder/wide left hustler, arguably a good fit for potentially any one of Chadli, Lennon, Holtby or even Dembele or Bentalab.

Given such a system, Davies would typically start, with Rose offering a more attacking alternative in a system that commits both full backs.

&gt;

&gt;A __joke__ is something spoken, written, or done with [humorous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour) intention.  Jokes may have many different forms, e.g., a single word or a gesture (considered in a particular context), a question-answer, or a whole [short story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story). The word ""joke"" has [a number of synonyms](https://en.wikipedia.org//en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wikisaurus:joke), including *wisecrack*, [gag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag), [prank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prank), [quip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quip), [jape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jape) and *jest*.  To achieve their end, jokes may employ [irony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony), [sarcasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm), [word play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_play) and other devices. Jokes may have a [punch line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_line), i.e., an ending to make it humorous.

&gt;A [practical joke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_joke) or [prank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prank) differs from a spoken joke in that the major component of the humour is physical rather than verbal (for example placing salt in the sugar bowl).

So there's a massive ideological inconsistency there. In fact, they should leave solidarity in that respect to the DUP, who could get Pastor McConnell to announce that he trusts Palestinians because they probably all think homosexuals are bestial and should be put to death in the name of God.

Sinn Fein sympathise with the fact of military occupation and the concept of a stateless people, but the idea of ""a nation once again"" resonates with Israel too seeing as the Jews were stateless for thousands of years, always longed for a homeland and of course Israel has had to fight for its survival militarily on multiple occasions, not least [1948](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War), [1967](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War), [1973](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War), when all the surrounding Arab countries tried to wipe it off the map.

true,BallPlayingRightBack,null,null,"**1. How do you think this season will go?**

Expectations will be really high this season. We now have a squad that can match City in the PL and with Jose as our manager, I believe we can challenge the Bayerns and Madrids in the CL as well. It's been 4 years since we last won the league, it has to be the priority this season and Jose knows that. The league, one of the domestic cups and last 4 of the CL and I'll be a happy fan.

**2. Which 3 players should other fans watch out for and why?**

**Andre Schurrle** - On the back of winning the World Cup his confidence will be sky high. I think he'll make the RW position his own this season and with his direct approach he'll get plenty of goals and assists as well.

**Cesar Azpilicueta** - He's the kind of player that is loved by the manager, the players and the fans alike. He'll play in his natural position of Right Back this season and with his work rate and energy, I expect him to have an even better season than the last one.

**Marco Van Ginkel** - Jose has a knack of getting the best out of his CMs and I'm expecting big things from MvG this season. He was bought last season but a serious injury meant he missed the entire season. He'll be like a new signing and I believe he'll be the one who ends up partnering Matic in our central midfield.

That season he got sacked was actually something that out of all the years Torres has been with us the one I have been the angriest with him for. I mean at least now we know he is shit and can expect him to be shit but not so much back then, he was our record signing and golden boy after all. Ancelotti was sacked a few months after we signed Torres and had Torres not been completely shit he might not have. That half of the season Torres scored only 1 goal in 18 appearances for Chelsea. If we even gotten a half decent amount of goals from Torres that season I honestly think we could have clinched the title.

Ancelotti was only 3 points away from United, with a game against them and 2 other matches left in the season. Thats when we needed our ""star man"" and new ""icon"" most of all to step up and he didn't.

Those last three games of that season could have changed so much. Man United, Newcastle and Everton. It would have been a very well earned title as well because we were making a strong come back near the end.

Edit: Also, another thing people don't give Ancelotti enough credit for was his defense. Even though he was sacked and took the title to the very last few games we still conceded the least goals in the league.

Fatah does not like Hamas. Fatah fought a war with Hamas. But Fatah won't stand by and watch Palestinians die like that. Similar story with Sinn Féin.

Seriously, supporting Palestine is one of the more understandable and relatable things that Sinn Féin and other republicans do.

true,NathDriver,eng-yorkshire,Dewsbury,"If coursework and essays are too easy because of the 'massive availability of information' then someone needs to let the universities and their scholars and researchers know because it's not stopping them from writing essays and not being pulled up for it.

The issue is not with the availability of information but with how pupils are taught to use and respond to that information. If they're left unchecked then the copy and pasting you mentioned is inevitable. I believe that it is my responsibility as a teacher (and the larger point of coursework, to an extent) to teach my pupils the correct way to parse and apply what they read online. We also have University links so that pupils are able to request academic articles rather than relying on spark notes or gradesaver or any of that other shite. Similarly, anyone caught using spark notes more than once in a year is ejected from the course; it's not perfect but we are trying. But even then, if a pupil uses spark notes to develop their own genuinely interesting idea, or uses it as something to argue AGAINST, then they should not be blindly punished for that. 

I suppose that at a certain point it comes down to what the teacher wants pupils to get from the course and what the pupils themselves want and need. It's a consistent war between grades and nurturing a genuine passion for literature. Stray too far either side and you miss the point of the other. Either way, I do not think that removing coursework entirely us the answer. It develops skills (redrafting, synthesising information from different sources, considering others' opinions) that are far more invaluable in both academic and professional life than most exams do.

true,total_cynic,,I don't have a bike,"For you:

practice, relax (try and keep your elbows slightly bent), look and plan a really long way ahead so you can pick smooth lines that miss manhole covers (which are more common in corners) and can brake smoothly and gently.

Try to get in the habit of using the vision you've got to decelerate almost without having to touch the brakes. Think about lane positioning, anywhere in a bend that sees heavy wear from car tyres will tend to have less grip than somewhere that is rarely driven over.

I tend to find that there's more grip in really heavy rain than in marginal drizzle, presumably because the road surface is washed properly clean. In really heavy rain, be aware that manhole and drain covers can lift from the force of water underneath, and can be hard to see in semi-standing water.

If you're really in tune with the bike, you can get a surprising amount of feedback on the amount of grip available by how heavy the steering is, lighter steering -&gt; less grip.

If you anticipate needing the brakes, very gently apply them a few moments in advance, just to get the water off the disks. In a developing emergency, you can think there's nothing there for a split second as that water is swept away, over-apply the brakes, and then lock the wheels.

For the bike:

make certain the wheels are in straight, the tyres are correctly inflated to the right pressure, aren't rubbish, and have a decent amount of tread on them - on the front check the shoulders of the tyre as well as the centre.

For larger bikes (you ride a 50 IIRC?) consider the design aims of the tire you buy and the kind of riding you do. A sports touring tyre will do far better in the wet than something intended for track days.

For me, I like an engine idle at the bottom of the range specified in the manual, so I've got as much engine braking as possible. I can then ease off the throttle, the bike will settle in slight deceleration and then I'll start braking.

Check that the front brake lever pivot and the pad that actually presses the master cylinder piston are clean and lubricated. When you're trying to finely apply the brake, a stick/slip motion here can really upset things.

Also check the steering head bearings aren't notchy or overtight, it makes it much harder to judge what the front wheel is doing.",0,1407832945,null,0,false,0,cjnwy7y,t3_2d8qby,t1_cjnwy7y,t1_cjnimp3,null,1435195834,3,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,3

Indirectly though they do. More money in the NHS pot, more healthy people (equaling less sick days, more productive nation), less congestion, less pollution. Less road wear, less potholes etc...

These things benefit everyone.

Im guessing there are a great many kids who live in close proximity to that school, Im guessing that their parents drive them in causing congestion and danger around the school like 99pc of schools all over the UK? If yes, it does benefit you. Maybe not allot, but to some degree it does.

&gt;Building cycle lanes will mot make people cycle

Doing it right will.

The Germans built good cycle lanes and people cycled, the French built good cycle lanes and people cycled. And placed like the Netherlands cycling is so common around 35pc of trips are done by bike. Cities in many 1st world nations are pushing cycling as an alternative and people are using them.

Of course this wont happen overnight, might take a generation or three. Which is reason to start sooner rather than later.

Are you open to the idea of car sharing, Are you going to take public transport,  Do you really believe more roads are a sustainable option - if yes at what point should we stop building roads?

&gt;You can't force people to do fitness

Its not about forcing people though, cycling need be no more diffident that walking. There's no need to stink of sweat.

true,JamJarre,cnty-uk,Liverpewl,"Essentially the Coalition has undertaken a real re-tooling of the Fast Stream to make it more like a corporate grad scheme. Francis Maude has been leading this efforts, and the results are:

Old Fast Stream:

* You stay in your 'Home Department' for at least two years and move around teams within the department each year
* You are directly employed by that Department
* You stay where you're posted - if you go to London you can stay there, if you're elsewhere you can stay there too
* Pay begins at £27,000 with increases in line with your Department's standards (pay band goes up to around £30k usually)
* Annual leave is based on Departmental standards but usually it's around 30 days plus bank holidays
* Can go for promotion at any time

New ""Corporate"" Fast Stream

* You move departments every six months
* You're technically employed by HMRC, not the Department you work in
* One of your first four placements is a secondment to the private sector
* One of your first four placements is ""regional"", most likely running a Job Centre
* Pay is capped at £27,000 and there is no pay band
* 22 days of annual leave a year
* Not allowed to go for promotion until Year 3 of the scheme
* Pension is decent but not as good as the old one
* Scheme is centrally run by Civil Service Resourcing, who aren't very good it has to be said

I think probably as a recent graduate you'd be OK because the six month rotations will help you pick up skills. However, it's a real crapshoot because the quality of the work you do and the projects you pick up is entirely dependent on the people in your department. Some are great, some not so much. There's much less of a team focus because you're only going to be there six months - it's not enough time to get your feet on the ground and get to know people. If you aren't someone who can change up their job every six months, get dropped into an entirely new situation and thrive then you probably won't like it. It suits a very specific kind of person - if you're meticulous, into relationship-building and want to be the go-to person for your policy area, that's not going to happen on this scheme. You'll always be a little thrown off and playing catch-up.

It's almost entirely around your own personal development, and not providing a public service. Feathering your own cap, throwing other people under the bus to save yourself: all that stuff is very common. I find it a hugely dispiriting and soulless place to work, which is a shame as I came into from a public service angle.

Oh also there's no money anywhere. We had trouble procuring basic stationery. Public sector squeeze, man.

It's not a bad thing to have on your CV by any means and I do know people who are enjoying it (though all agree that basically the new intake have been shafted and get a raw deal compared to the old scheme), but the Fast Stream at the moment is very much coasting on its reputation and prestige - all of which has been built up on the old scheme.",0,1407834045,null,0,false,0,cjnx5on,t3_2cf0tz,t1_cjnx5on,t1_cjnb3ik,null,1435195933,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

I don't know Walton on thames specifically but I live in Kingston which is similar enough.

How is your office connected to public transport? Is a bus possible? Ask your new boss this they will be very helpful.

Let's talk money:
1br Flat = £950 (Again, this is my estimation- It wont be the nicest in the world, but it will do- this will get super cheap when(if?) you're girlfriend moves in too)

council tax = £150

utilities inc internet = £150 (Can someone chime in here? my girlfriend sorts the bills out so pretty clueless)

Food = £200

Total: £1450.00

Money remaining each month: £550

I would really advise against getting a car if you can.
Also if you look into house sharing your budget will get a lot better, a room will only cost you about £500.00p/m, which makes your remaining money turn into £1,000.



EDIT: If your girlfriend moves with you, you wont really have any money troubles at all... I used to be on similar money and iirc was saving about £600.00per month, eating takeaway once a week and boozing it up twice per week.

Bringing in Eto'o absolutely reeks of desperation. In Sturridge we have our #1, in Borini we have an understudy of sorts, in Rickie we have the elder statesman, what we needed now is a Remy, a ST who in a team slightly smaller could be the top dog. 

Signing Eto'o with Rickie already here is not only a mistake it's pointless imo. I've been delighted with our business so far but without an adequate stopgap for when Sturridge gets injured, and he will, will cost us points.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt;See, now you've just assumed everybody in prison has no regard for any laws.

The people who are in prison have all broken at least one **serious** law, **which has lead to imprisonment** which is more than the vast majority of the population ever will. Its not difficult to behave in a way which does not land you in prison. 

People are rarely sent to prison for minor crimes. The number of criminals in prison for motoring offences for example is less than 300 across the whole of the country. The vast majority of people in prison are there for offences such as violence against another person, theft, burglary, and sexual offences. 

One of the major reasons we send people to prison is to protect the public from their influence on them. You lose some of your liberty's and freedoms as a prisoner, one of them is that you cannot come and go as you please, this prevents you from doing any more harm to the public until  you are deemed rehabilitated and able to make appropriate decisions. 

Why should we as a society trust your decision making ability in terms of how you vote, if we cannot even trust you to walk the streets safely? We are protecting the public from you in a physical sense, why not cut of your influence on them completely?

&gt;They have regard to some laws, not others. Laws being the collective rule set of a society, being a part of that society, they should have a say in what should and should not be law.

When you kill someone, or rob them, or assault them, you are not just breaking one law, you are showing total disregard for so much of what we consider important in our society, most importantly you show that you  have little regard for anyone but yourself and your own selfish desires, and not even the laws of the land will stop you from doing as you please. Voting comes with responsibilities, and you have to show that you are a responsible person before you are allowed to vote. You cannot vote if you are a child because a child is not responsible enough, you cannot vote you are detained in a mental institution because you are not deemed responsible to do so. Being in prison is a very clear symbol of your inability to engage with society at an acceptable level, and so prisoners are prevented from voting. 

&gt;Do you think you can come up with a better sentence than a judge?

British judges have constantly voted that it is reasonable to deny prisoners the vote. 

&gt;Are you so cruel, you think prison just isn't tough enough?

Denying the vote doesn't make prison any more tough for the prisoner, it simply prevents them from having any more of a negative impact on society until they are rehabilitate and can be deemed responsible enough to make a decision as important as voting.

If Eto signs, from now until the end of the season he'll cost us roughly £3.8 mil, excluding any signing on bonus.

There's certainly a risk involved as age isn't on his side (whatever age he is) and he didn't exactly set the league alight last season. I think for a year, he might be worth the risk considering he'll only be a stop gap until Origi joins and a good option off the bench, however, I'd still like to see us sign another quality striker if possible. I still have a feeling that Borini will end up at Sunderland if the right player becomes available to us and Sunderland sell Wickham.

Sturridge, new signing, Eto &amp; Lambert would be good options in my opinion (depending on who we get).",0,1407839770,null,0,false,0,cjny6v3,t3_2dbksj,t1_cjny6v3,t3_2dbksj,null,1435196485,0,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,0

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; Your outlook also completely ignores any aspect of redemption or rehabilitation the prison system is meant to encourage. 

No it doesn't it's the complete opposite, prison should be all about rehabilitation. 

You enter prison because you have committed a crime, and you must be rehabilitated so that you can be trusted not to commit any more crimes. 

While you are undergoing rehabilitation, you are considered unfit to be a part of society. That is why we lock prisoners up behind big walls away from the general public. We remove them physically, and we also remove their non physical influence by taking away their vote, amongst other things. 

Part of rehabilitation is admitting what you did was wrong, that you made a bad decision, and society suffered because of it, and that you deserve to be removed from society while you are acting in this way. 

Once your rehabilitation is complete you can be welcomed back into society with open arms. It is a great thing when a prisoner is completely rehabilitated to the point where they really will never commit another crime again. 
Part of the process of completing your rehabilitation is getting your vote back. It is society saying that we trust you to make decisions that will benefit society, not make it worse.

Nowhere have I said that removing prisoners vote is a punishment, its not. Its simply a logical step in the process of rehabilitation. Remove the influence of people who have committed crimes, give it back when they are ready to rejoin society.

As I said earlier, it is not difficult to live a life which doesn't land you in prison. Different crimes have different levels of seriousness. When you actually end up in prison you have almost certainly committed a serious crime which has seriously harmed society. 

The key point of my argument is that we send people to prison to cut off their physical influence on the rest of society. We prevent them from voting to cut off their non physical influence on society. When they are rehabilitated they get both back. 

A better list of crimes might be to look at the sort of crimes people are actually sent to prison for. The vast majority are for violent crimes, theft and burglary, and supply and trafficking of drugs.

People can the be released ""on licence"" which means there are restrictions - eg no gong abroad without permission, no moving home without permission, regular meetings with the Probation Service etc. A breach of these conditions can land you back in prison. Having said that for the most serious of crimes a judge can specify the life sentence is a ""whole life order"" - which means there is no minimum term and no eligibility for release. The Home Secretary can order release on compassionate grounds, but that is rare. There are very few people on whole life orders (less than 100 IIRC). The other relatively recent ECtHR decision (also widely misreported) said that whole life orders should be reviewed at a later date to make sure they are still necessary (eg after 20-25 years). This does not mean whole life orders are a breach of human rights, only that the decision of a single judge to send someone to prison forever should be looked at later - which makes total sense to me.

&gt; Aston Villa have completed a deal for Elche midfielder Carlos Sanchez, Goal understands. The Colombia international has signed a four-year deal with Paul Lambert’s team after a £4.8 million (€6m) fee was agreed with the Liga side. Goal has learned that Sanchez is due in the west Midlands on Tuesday to complete a medical with the club expected to announce the transfer as early as this evening. Sanchez, nicknamed The Rock, has been heavily linked with a move to Villa Park this summer after an impressive World Cup with Jose Pekerman’s team and will provide Villa with further options in central midfield. The 28-year-old joins after one season in Spain, where he helped keep Elche in the top-flight as they finished 16th. Sanchez, who has 44 caps for Colombia, has been previously linked with Bolton and West Ham while at French side Valenciennes

The most important thing is to create an environment that people want to spend their time in, which means neither the bar nor the staff should be depressing. 

You also need to offer real ales and good food, with favourites people can depend on, and guest beers and a menu featuring specials that change, for those who want to try new things. Preferably staff should be enthusiastic about the beer or food and enjoy talking to people about it.

If you get all these points right, your customer base will be relatively large and with enough regulars that they get to know each other and so the pub atmosphere is self-sustaining.

Lastly, it's best not to be tied to a brewery or pubco.

Section 7: Fire Safety  

We install smoke alarms and sprinklers, perform Operational Risk Reviews of buildings and businesses which are available to other First Responders, and go and tell kids not to dick about with matches. 

Section 8: Road Traffic Collisions. 

We cut people out of cars

Section 9: Emergencies

This is not true. Cambridge do ask for your marks from your first year exams but they certainly do not require certain percentages in certain modules - the usual rule of thumb is a 90% average, although certainly people have got in with less than this.

Aside from that, you'll be asked to do [STEP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Term_Examination_Paper) which makes a 95% in FP1 look like a total joke (Warwick and other universities ask for this too now).",0,1407844752,null,0,false,0,cjnz8x9,t3_2d9yqi,t1_cjnz8x9,t1_cjnrxae,null,1435196983,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

Apart from that, A wembley final should be the aim. What happens in a final is always dificult to predict, but to get to the final should be a real focus. 

  
For the ECL, we will be in a really tough group due to our seeding. To get out of the group will obviously be a target. But if we do get out of the group, I think the belief will be to go on. The team would have had to beat 2 really strong teams to get out of the group and with the Anfield fixtures in the knockout round, there will be real belief that the team can push on. It is then where our squad will be tested to its limits.

Motorists demand to be treated equally to other road users (fair enough) and what happens? They run red lights (illegal), drive on pavements (illegal), pass dangerously close to pedestrians and cyclists (which I saw four times on my cycle in this morning alone).

&gt; I'm not sure what grouping you classify as cyclists - but right now they're a law unto themselves. I like a bike ride, but it would shame me to call myself a cyclist alongside the aggressive, law breaking, selfish, nasty people that make up some of that group right now.

I'm not sure what grouping you classify as motorists - but right now they're a law unto themselves. I like travel by car, but it would shame me to call myself a motorist alongside the aggressive, law breaking, selfish, nasty people that make up some of that group right now.

-----

I classify cyclists and motorists and pedestrians as **people**.  Some people are selfish. Some people are generous.  Some people are rude. Some people are polite. Some people got out of bed on the wrong side this morning.

We always notice people who offend us or put us in danger more than those who don't.  We always notice unusual things more than usual things.  Cyclists are a relatively unusual sight on the road, so they are more noticeable than cars are.  Interacting with cyclists is also more *personal* than interacting with motorists, because motorists are depersonalised by the fact they are hidden within their vehicles.

You saw two cyclists riding too close to pedestrians this morning, but how many cyclists did you see who rode carefully around pedestrians and treated them courteously? I had a motorist carry out a ""punishment pass"" on me on the way to work this morning, and another pull out in front of me, and I remember them very clearly, but I don't remember whether any motorists politely waited for me to cross at a junction or waited behind me to give space for an overtake.

-----

Finally, *some* cyclists are indeed rude and dangerous road users.  I don't understand why this is taken as a reason not to provide for the majority of safe, considerate cyclists.  Why should they be held accountable for the actions of people over whom they have no control and no influence?  Making this argument is like saying, ""Some motorists are rude and dangerous, so we shouldn't build any roads until they stop.""

-----

As a final point: there are very few ""clean, flat, stable cycle lanes"" in the UK that are of sufficiently high quality that I would choose to use them if I had any alternative.  I'm very fortunate that about half of my 16-mile cycle ride to work has usable cycle facilities that support riding at a sensible speed, but they are often overgrown, frequently strewn with broken glass from car accidents, and regularly completely blocked by motorists that have decided to park on them.

2) So giving police it is to degrade the work of thouse in 1).

c) Don't do it. 

Wut?

She is completely missing out a range of cases, for example picking someone up very late at night, or during times of extreme load, where not having to go through an intermediary to get this information might actually provide serious welfare benefits. 

**EDIT 2:** to provide a concrete example, lets imagine someone gets picked up for being what appears to be drunk and violent. Lets also imagine that the social services and local mental health lot are just completely overwhelmed and not picking up calls or emails.

Now are we really to belive, all other things being equal. Is it not maybe a good idea, if police could asseratin quickly by accessing this guys medical records, whether he is in fact just some drunk and in the tank he goes, or a schizophrenic who very well might be suffering a serious episode and has a history of self harm?

After all, its not like people with serious mental health, or other health problems have died

Also the bit about 'well people might not give info' is a red herring, we are talking about police getting access to existing information not creating new metrics of information.

It's just not a good argument. Whatever your stance is on this. It's almost like (heaven perish the thought) she decided it was bad, then tried to construct an argument to butress this. not came to the conclusion it was bad by logically following a series of premises. 

Edit: Maybe again, this is just me putting too much of a 'well maybe you should actually know your shit' criteria upon a guardian journo. But she badly misunderstands the 'point' of British police, which since Peel has been policing by consent, NOT the arbitrary enforcement of the law. Indeed, many of the principles of policing by consent, revolve around protecting members of the public. NOT an attempt at universal application of the law.

Perhaps that's too subtle a distinction... but her misapplication of it it is one that launches her entire argument

Oh Guardian.





Just to be clear, i'm not defending the guy who's proposing this or the exact nature of the proposal, its just to rule it out on shitty grounds is not how we should be doing debate about things like this, given how this country handles mental health is fucking atrocious still. all options should be on the table and be considered on their own merits not simply discounted out of hand for shitty reasons.

Sorry, I didn't realise this was a 'one or the other' type thing? Or can we not say anything bad about cyclists because (you) will turn around and say 'but motorists do it as well!'?... 

(Do you think we'd go easy on ISIS if they turned around and said 'but X terrorist organisation are also killing people!'?) 

&gt; Cyclists are a relatively unusual sight on the road, so they are more noticeable than cars are. 

Maybe where you live - not where I live? 

&gt; You saw two cyclists riding too close to pedestrians this morning, but how many cyclists did you see who rode carefully around pedestrians and treated them courteously? 

Funnily enough, none. There were two cyclists at that crossing - both ran the red light and both swerved around pedestrians. 

The motorists you mention were wrong. The cyclists I mentioned are wrong. The existence of one does not negate the wrong-ness of the other. 

We should have to tolerate neither. 

&gt; Making this argument is like saying, ""Some motorists are rude and dangerous, so we shouldn't build any roads until they stop.""

Motorists can and are prosecuted for road crimes. Filming of motorists is increasing - plenty of examples on Youtube of bad drivers and the follow up where they're caught and prosecuted. 

I for one am fed up of cyclists (as a fellow bike rider) making us look bad, as well as acting as they please on road, pavement and bike lane with near impunity. The last time I remember a cyclist being pulled over? Never. *Never*. 

I'll start believing in true equality and safety for all road users as long as soon as they start properly self policing themselves, being prosecuted for criminal actions etc. Right now the cyclists love to demonise the motorists but (as you have) they make excuses or try and draw the blame when cyclists flat our break the law and endanger others. 

I don't think it's inappropriate to get fed up of this way of using the roads and to expect cyclists to act with the same respect for others as they wish for themselves. They're not policed. They're not prosecuted. They want to have it both ways - safety, so long as they can hop up on the pavement or run that red light if it's more convenient for *them*. 

2 wheels should not be a license to use the road like a twat. Having nearly been hit 3 times in the last 6 months and witnessed more near misses just yesterday - there are an awful lot of twats on two wheels around who could use a hefty fine.

true,Jaraxo,eng-lincolnshire,Grimsby Area,"Source: I was at Lancaster from 2009-2012.

The student life is okay. The campus bars are nice if you live near the right one. Cartmel/Londsale bars suck, but County and Fylde and the one near the pizza place up the other end of campus aren't bad, but they were never that cheap. Most would only ever use them when watching the football and having a couple of pints, never for a night out. Grad bar, in the post-grad section of campus, is right next to Cartmel/Londsale colleges, and is the best bar on campus imo.

Lancaster nightlife, if you're used to a proper city will suck. There was only one proper club, Sugar, and that was never that great. IT was good if you were hammered, but where isn't? There's a Revolution and a few other smaller bars/clubs, but nothing major. There are plenty of smaller ""local"" style pubs with real ales though if that's your thing.

The campus is also kind of isolated. You're a 15minute bus ride from Lancaster its self, which is great if you live on campus and don't go out, but travelling on buses can be a hassle. That being said, if going out and getting hammered isn't your thing you could never leave campus. There are the few bars mentioned above, as well as your basic Spar shop and student union equivalent. A 24 hour pizza place, post office and you can get all your food shopping delivered from Tesco/Sainsbury/Asda. Loads of takeaways deliver also.

I really liked living on campus all three years tbh, as a city style nightlife wasn't my thing.

Accommodation: Try and find out where your lectures will be. I chose Cartmel because it was the nicest, but it was also the most expensive and furthest away from everything. Bowland is right in the centre of campus, but it's cheap and no way near as nice. If you want to smoke in your room, Bowland is the best bet as no one gives a crap there. There are plenty of choices in between the two though. If I were to go again, I'd avoid Cartmel or Lonsdale, because they are the furthest away from everything, and have the worst bars.

On the plus side with Lancaster, you're only 30-40 mins away from Manchester on the train, which is nice, and the city is fantastic for that small, historic city feel. There's a great, free Fireworks show every year, as well as beer festivals.

The internet was really fast. When I left they were on 100mb down fibre lines, which was fantastic, however some things like XBL suffered due to network issues. They also occasionally caught people torrenting, my flatmate got caught three times, so if you're doing that, it's probably best to try and hide it rather than using public trackers openly.

The weather can also be pretty grim. The campus is up on a hill, so you get all the rain and wind and it's just bloody awful at times. That being said, in the summer there's nothing better than sitting out on the fields, or going walking in the nearby lakes.

There are a fucktonne of clubs to join as well. From all the sports such as football, rugby, American football, hockey, to a full swimming pool and gym which is cheaper if you're a student. Then there's things like the gaming societies, cheer leading, marching band, karate and a shit load of other things.

So it's totally doable.  Unfortunately the UK population seem to be totally addicted to unnecessary and unsustainable car travel, which provides a lot of political resistance to the kind of integrated planning that's required for providing high quality, usable infrastructure.

I was involved in helping to survey and plan Guildford's ""new"" cycle network.  Guildford has remarkably poor cycle provision.  While carrying out the survey, I was struck by just how many places there were where there was plenty of *space* to provide extremely high quality cycle routes.  However:

* the budget in Surrey for sustainable transport development is very low
* the highway planning department literally doesn't talk to the cycling officers, so junctions get redesigned without any cyclist input and end up being dangerous or completely impractical or both
* *any* perceived reduction in motorised traffic flow (real or imagined) is enough to convince the Conservative council to block cycling developments
* it's impossible to remove even a single on-road parking space in order to improve safety for cyclists
* even the cycling officers consider pavements too narrow for two cyclists to ride past each other as suitable for shared-use provision.

The problem is not that there is not enough space.

true,HugoRune1965,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"That's only if you go through a claims management service, not through your insurer. OP is using his own insurance company.

Claims management companies work by handling your claim for you and sorting out car hire for a replacement vehicle. They are only useful if you were definitely not at fault, and they will not represent you without the car hire though because that's how they make their money. 

My wife used one recently when her car was hit while parked in a car park. The driver admitted full liability and the insurance broker recommended the claims management company.

It works as follows:

You agree to take on a credit agreement. This is used to pay for the repairs and the car hire, but it is claimed off the other party's insurance so you should not have to pay.

It is also backed by a separate insurance policy (which again you do not pay for). This is in case the claim goes to court and the claims management company does not get all the costs back. However, you must agree to cooperate fully with any legal action that the claims management company take out on the other person's insurance.

In practice they are OK to use if you can demonstrate that you need a replacement car, and you don't have access to another car. You must make every effort to ensure that you only use the hire car for the duration of the repair and don't do anything that would prolong the hire.

 Also it is likely that the insurer will initially reject the claim and you will be asked to fill in a questionnaire for the claims management company to threaten legal action. Chances are though it will not actually go to court as long as you are honest and cooperate as much as you can.

I don't particularly like the idea of these companies, but I think they exist because of insurers trying to weasel out of paying.

and as I said, in the case of British police, its actually something that reasonably *does* fall under their remit. They unlike all most of the worlds police have a duty of care to the community and the individuals comprising it. Written into the core of why the exist as an institution in the first place. People seem to forget this, pretty near universally. 

And you cannot reasonably expet social services or mental health or whatever to keep parity in terms of deployable manpower with the police 24/7.

And if this comes down to a 'well they shouldn't have thouse powers'. Well, neither should anyone without safeguards. The medical profession manages not to abuse this knowledge.

true,hiakuryu,cnty-england,London,"I'm not taking advantage of them though. I've had countless ""Brits"" turn their nose down, sniff dismissively or flat out ignore me calling them with offers of work.

My family runs a property development and management business. They're a small firm definitely but on the top end of the Small firms so we end up having contracts and tenders out for builders that run the whole gamut of budgetary scales from a few hundreds of pounds to a few million pounds ok?

My mother was a bit unwell recently and I took some time off work to help out. I called 5 builders to ask for quotes. I got 2 calls in return. TWO. Admittedly it was a tiny job, only a couple of grand by my count, but it's still polite to return the calls no?

We had this lovely Brazilian cleaner go through the communal areas of the buildings that we own. We paid her directly and she charged about £11/hr and she works like the clappers. She cleans three of our buildings and takes 6 hours to do it. She even got hired by most of the people renting from us to be their cleaner. She's given up now as she's having kids and wants to raise the family with her partner, I've tried REALLY hard to find a replacement and gone through 30 applicants for the part time work and etc right? A few of the applicants were Brits, we tried them out and, no, just no. So I'm back to looking for cleaners again. She even offered to come back to help me out because I've taken over the cleaning of the communal areas personally. I said thanks but no thanks because well, I'd feel guilty as fuck making a woman who is 6 months pregnant with twins vacuum a bunch of staircases. 

The best chippie I've ever used was a guy who turned up on site one day and asked if we needed a carpenter. He brought his own tools and etc. He is polish. I took him on on a trial basis for a month at standard rates and he was always on time, the first to get on site hours before the English carpenter and left until the job was finished, never once did he knock off early, not like the British carpenter, whose time keeping was, rather... interesting to say the least. Needless to say he's now our permanent carpenter and I've never spoken to the guy whose place he's taken ever again. 

We're not looking for cheap labour, we're not looking to exploit people, but it seems to me and my experiences that the immigrants we hire versus the Brits is that they generally have a much stronger work ethic and aren't going to fuck me over by turning up late or doing a half arsed job.

I've also got a lot of friends and experiences with the services folks and they've all said the exact same thing, the friends they've left behind. They're all still sat at home collecting dole money and rejected cleaners jobs, forklift drivers jobs and etc etc. They're all of the opinion that barring a few exceptional cases the people they've left behind are work shy skivers who need to get their thumbs out.

I see our season in simpler terms (if we do get that one decent striker we are looking for), most of our squad has played together in the new system, our core is very talented and we have a manager that turned their talent into end product. Arse fans will disagree, Chelsea fans will bitch etc. but our manager is the one I back the most to get the best out of average players. But there is a limit to that, and hopefully after this window he will have gotten better players to work with and develop than last season.

Peer pressure. Same as motorists. I've seen people change their driving style because of it - and if not? Actual policing. Arrest the cyclists and fine them. Make it unattractive to swerve dangerously past people through red lights. 

&gt; I see far, far more motorists acting like twats than cyclists acting like twats.

There are far far more motorists on roads than cyclists, but again *it's not about motorists vs. cyclists. It's just about cyclists.* 

Furthermore I'm sure you're not saying we should step back and ignore dangerous cycling because of this, especially as there's such an active effort to get more cyclists on the road? 

&gt; Why don't we concentrate on stopping the twats who kill, maim and cripple thousands of people each year before worrying about the twats who merely frighten or offend?

Ah, so that's exactly what you're saying. 

Why complicate it? On the spot fines for dangerous cycling and an active database of offenders including personal details and registration of their bicycles / serial numbers. No lengthy paperwork - keep it simple and straightforward. 

You seem hell bent on making this about motorists on the premise that they're a greater threat. I'm not downplaying the threat of a metal box vs. flesh - but see that as no reason to ignore dangerous, illegal cycling.

The problem as I see it, is that typically, British people do not put much faith in how their presence makes others feel. When needing to dress for an occasion and meet with friends, its also like a lot of us need to force ourselves through the same inner-dialogue of if it would be worthwhile, or if we'd be welcome. A lot of that could be tied in with the large number of the population diagnosed with depression, yet even that doesn't seem to stop some healthier people from being more passive in keeping their social ties strong. So when my father's old friend had to return to Germany after some years to care for his infirm mother, my father simply didn't put in the effort, because he didn't wish to impose.

I hope you're not referring to me there because I never attacked anyone due to nationality. I actually clarified that multiple times in which I literally got ''tl;dr you're a cunt'' replies after taking the time to explain.

I commented on the clear differences between the optimism/criticisms and such and how this is handled between sets of fans. There was a good post on /r/soccer about this I saw - and for once, it was relatively civil and the overall standpoint was people agreed that there's a difference. That was the *only* reason I mentioned a nationality, as I noticed (not presumed, I checked post history) all of my hate and downvotes was coming from American fans who probably took my comments as offensive and in a negative light. Cue twisting of words, me apparently saying ''Americans know nothing about football'' and it just escalated from there. That was not my intention - differences does not mean one is better, or worse or invalidates someones support. I think people would die if they saw what is said on Spurs forums about Townsend that are *primarily* British - I even gave examples. 

That's the only reason I mentioned it because it's something I've even noticed on here at times. We're much less optimistic, and much more critical. ",0,1407848437,null,0,false,0,cjo0acb,t3_2da9em,t1_cjo0acb,t1_cjo04z8,null,1435197473,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

true,Quazz,capaldi,Capaldi,"Depends on the circumstances. 

For example in the Children in Need Special, 5 met 10 because of their TARDISes colliding which meant that 10 remembered the event of when he was 5. (allowing him to fix the situation)

But if say they're plucked from their timeline to do X (eg Five Doctors) then none of them have any memory of those events as they haven't taken place yet in his timeline and are thus not possible to remember yet.

Then you have the situation where they ""step into"" each other's timelines. This is what essentially happened in Day of the Doctor. This is where only the latest version remembers the events. It's as if the timeline of the latest incarnation is where the events take place, the main timeline so to speak, and the others are just piggyback riding. They remember as long as they're in there, but once they're out they'll forget until they ""become"" the main timeline.

The Day of the Doctor makes this quite complicated, because 12 shows up. (essentially behind the scenes for most of it) which is why 11 didn't remember most of it, except when he needed it (aka when 12 couldn't be there, The Moment interfering) which is how he suddenly came to the conclusion of saving Gallifrey ""I've been thinking about it for centuries!"". He couldn't possibly remember that if he wasn't the main timeline here. 

However, during the actual saving of Gallifrey 12 shows up again, which is why they don't actually know if they saved Gallifrey afterwards. 

And then of course there's the Curator, making it even more complicated. 

Important to note about all of this is that the events that take place before the timelines cross can and usually are remembered. (eg War Doctor having the Moment and intending to use it to destroy Gallifrey and Daleks.

Then I mentioned perhaps it's because the two sets of fans (Americans/British) handle criticism differently - English fans are naturally much more critical and un-optimistic.

Cue ''i'm a faggot, condescending, cunt, xenophobe'' and so on from other users and Americans who took that and physically said I'm implying that they ''know nothing'' and that I feel I am ''superior''. I'm sure a few jumped on from here, but that's how it initially started and why most of the remaining hate is coming from Americans. Nothing more, nothing less.

It's also a bit distasteful; they're Liverpool players now, some left on good terms, some not but we shouldn't have to make jabs at their previous club to make a good poster. The idea of having the three Saints players on it is a good one though.

The skin tone is off on each of the players, the facial hair is pretty sloppy looking, the shirt design looks good in some areas and patchy in others and is 3 different colours for each player which doesn't look great.

&gt;If the secret message from the Time Lords was being broadcast through *all of time and space*, why did the doctor never hear it before? 

Being broadcast throughout space and time doesn't necessarily mean it's being heard all that time. Evidently he encountered it at this point. This was the epicentre.

&gt;Also, using the same logic, how did all of the Doctor's enemies know to show up to Trenzalore at that specific moment in time?

Personally I don't consider most of the people I went to school with to be friends. They're people I know and I can reach them relatively easily should I wish to but I can't relate to them any more today than I could then. Their lives, priorities, personalities, and goals are so very different from my own.

I think the best group I've found in recent years were the collection of characters from /r/Edinburgh. I wish I'd met them sooner so I'd been able to spend more time with them.

I've never used Elements but it I image it's not the worst place to learn the basics. For vector images like the one you posted, Adobe Illustrator would be the standard program to use. Photoshop would be useful at times too. They're pretty expensive to buy but I'm sure if you have a look around online, maybe some day when there's *torrent*ial rain outside, you might find it.

If you want to enhance your skills, I'd say for now just use online tutorials, there's a few links below to get you started, even if you don't have the program, it's worth reading through them as you might pick up a trick or two:

true,trasofsunnyvale,lfc12,,"While I appreciate what you're trying to say, it doesn't make any sense to me. I do not, at all, think Eto'o is a commanding presence. The few goals I actually saw him get last year were poached goals or him being a beneficiary of a counter attack. Throughout his career Eto'o's (so many apostrophes) play has been based on his movement off the shoulder of the defense and his blistering pace. Now that he's 77 (or 33), his pace is gone and he's mainly just a finisher/poacher. I am not confident that he is really even a constant preoccupation of the defense--he just isn't good enough anymore, in my opinion.

As for Rickie, I don't think his movement does much at all to our shape. Our shape really ought not to be influenced by our striker at all. I'd also argue that the shape of the side is only important in midfield. Since we don't employ a ball winner and instead rely on time-wide pressing, positioning is everything for our midfield. You're right about his tendency to be isolated though, as his skill set lends itself to him playing closer to goal, as he has a hard time holding the ball up and then being able to get back into the play due to lack of pace. I think he'll be better when our midfield supports him more, which we've already seen guys like Henderson and Allen get better at.

The major difference is that I don't see Eto'o as plugging much of a hole as perhaps you do. I don't think he suits our style, and I'm not sure he brings much more of a skill set than Lambert, who scored more goals last year.

One is sort of a sports bar, and is busy. One is just a neighbourhood local/old fart pub that sounds busy when i walk past. One looked as if it was about to become flats, but now looks to be a refurb.

All were built 1850ish-1900 to service a busy barracks and industrial area that disappeared in the late 40s, and its miracle only one has gone, I can understand if a few more close, you don't need 1 pub for every 100 houses in a commuter town.

The most vocal end up being the majority for lack of any other evidence. 

I do still think though that it's hard to see value in improved cycling infrastructure when my daily exposure to cyclists is such a mixed bag. That's my anecdotal evidence but having been exposed to it again and again - it does make it hard to sympathise with the rest.

Think you got battered on this one not because you said you were English but because it *read* as if you were justifying your position and the veracity of your argument while diminishing other's arguments because you were English.

Then when things started going off the rails you started pointing out cultural difference which comes across as dismissive to other nationalities.

I don't think that was the intent in the least, matter of fact i think it is completely the opposite of what you were trying to accomplish but it could be interpreted in that manner to someone reading through it.

Earlier in this discussion I said (and you ignored):

&gt; As a final point: there are very few ""clean, flat, stable cycle lanes"" in the UK that are of sufficiently high quality that I would choose to use them if I had any alternative. I'm very fortunate that about half of my 16-mile cycle ride to work has usable cycle facilities that support riding at a sensible speed, but they are often overgrown, frequently strewn with broken glass from car accidents, and regularly completely blocked by motorists that have decided to park on them. Honestly, the only reason I use them is because they're better than riding on the adjacent trunk roads.

I am very strongly of the opinion that cyclists choose not to use many existing cycling facilities in the UK is because they are **shitty**.

He then proceeded to cycle parallel to the cycle path until the end of the road where the path naturally reconnected with the road. 

The cycle lane was perfectly serviceable and he ended up where it would normally have taken him – so why serve in front of another car across a pedestrian walkway and zebra crossing? 

I’ll appreciate the point if the cycle lane was awful but when cyclists are shunning even perfectly good cycle lanes, what’s the point in trying to build them?

It's the type of pub where you can go as a stranger and leave having made quite a few friends. You have the regulars who are always there, so before you know it you've made loads more friends. 

Compare this to the pub opposite (The Old Packhorse) - I rarely go there because it's the type of pub where groups of people who are already mates go, or work colleagues etc.

Also try pubs off the beaten track :-)",0,1407855514,null,0,false,0,cjo389n,t3_2dbnj7,t1_cjo389n,t1_cjnzf1g,null,1435198883,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

true,RedMedi,lfc12,,"As a Liverpool fan who didn't give us a chance of 4th place last season my predictions are relatively low:

League: 5th, I reckon we will just lose out to United because of Van Gaal's experience vs Rodgers'. I forsee a poor start to the season with 4 points from the first 3 games and we never quite catch up. I don't see us repeating the home wins against rivals we achieved last year. I think we will draw/lose to Arsenal and City and concede more draws (0-0s rather than 2-2s) to lower ranked opposition at home due to the Suarez factor.

FA Cup: I believe that we will reach the quarter finals at least unless we draw one of Arsenal, United, City or Chelsea early in which case I predict we will win against Arsenal or United at home but lose away and lose to City and Chelsea regardless. If we avoid those teams we will win it.

League Cup: See FA Cup.

Champions League: 
Group of Death: 3rd place with strong Europa league showing i.e. Win or Final appearance.
Kind group: Win the group and last 16 round and lose a closely contested quarter final against a top seed.",0,1407855552,null,0,false,0,cjo38x9,t3_2dbpm7,t1_cjo38x9,t3_2dbpm7,null,1435198893,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1
