true,Quagers,null,null,"&gt;but it ought to be widely understood that an inebriated woman, or anyone inebriated (who hasnt given prior consent for such situations with partners) cannot give consent.

While that sounds great on paper it just doesn't work in a practical sense, the majority of sexual encounters between inebriated couples who have no prior relationship are consensual and enjoyable. If you were to apply this principle strictly in practice there would be countless new rape cases every Fri night and thousands would be criminalised for partaking in an activity (getting shitfaced, pulling in a club and waking up in a strangers bed with a foggy recollection of how you got there) which has been around since booze was invented.

What if both parties are inebriated? Did they both rape each other? Do they both go to jail?

While its fine to declare the moral high ground of 'any inebriated person can't consent' and feel very good about yourself it is completely useless to do so and grossly simplifies a horribly nuanced and complicated issue which can only be decided on a case by case basis in a court of law.

true,Wabbithunter68,null,null,"1. Personal choice, although there are some key subjects like Maths and English that everyone has to do. Normally the A levels you do depend on the subjects you've previously studied.

2. Yes, you apply to universities through UCAS, normally choosing around three universities - you can choose different courses in the same one. Unlike the US, our universities tend to specialise in one area, you can do dual degrees but they're often connected subjects. If you haven't sat any exams yet the uni normally interviews you and you are offered a conditional place, but depending on how subscribed the course is there may be some leeway when it comes to admissions. If you've already got your exam results they can offer you a place without meeting you. When it comes to the requirements for a course it all depends on what one you've applied for, and often it can be waived for mature students.

3. They've recently changed the law and you now have to attend till you're 18. College in the UK it a hard thing to describe to someone not British. It's a higher education facility that normally covers a wide range of both academic and vocational courses. Most of those who attend are teenagers and early twenties, but you will also see mature students there. It's open to everyone. Normally places are offered after an interview.

4. I don't think there's that much disdain for private education, more for the 'old boys network' you see in business and politics. Education in some private schools may be on a par with the the best of state schools.

5. The majority of schools do have a uniform policy. It's supposed to put every student on the same level, but in reality it's not difficult to spot someone from a poor family. I'm indifferent to it, although when my daughter was attending high school I found it an extra expense I could have done without.

6. Sort of, but not to the extent that the US does. Normally universities have clubs that you can join and play regardless of ability.

true,TheViagraKid,null,null,"I've literally just finished school, so I guess I'm in a good position to answer these.

1. Some are compulsory: English, science &amp; mathematics. Some schools also make a modern language (French, German or Spanish generally) compulsory. Other than that it is mostly down to you. Some teachers may recommend you do/don't do their subject. A few of my friends weren't able to do some subjects together because the timetabling clashed. But I'd recommend to all kids choosing their GCSEs to **choose what you enjoy**. 

For A levels...you choose them based on what you want to do at university. But it is influenced by how well you did to a degree. Some schools will ask for a minimum of a B or a C (or sometimes even an A) at GCSE to continue the subject at A level.

2. We have to apply and we use a centralised system called UCAS. You choose 5 universities to apply to (or 4 if you're doing medicine) and you write a personal statement, get a reference and put in your grades and your application is sent off to the universities that off you a condition place based on your final A level results. 2Bs and an A is for the top-level universities really. You can get into plenty with 3 Bs or 3 Cs...but they just aren't as prestigious. The faculties set the requirements...and they generally range from AAA to ABB for top universities. Although the most competitive courses can go up to A-star, A-star, A. 

3. College here is, as you stated, generally more vocational (unless you're talking in the context of Oxford or Cambridge university, in which case it's part of the institution). There's technical colleges for vocational qualifications such as NVQs and diplomas in various trades that you can get. But you can go to some colleges and do A levels too, and some also specialise in A levels in areas where schools only go up to age 16 - 6th form colleges. Universities are all for degrees. You don't have to go to one, and I believe still less than 50% of people in the UK do.

4. You got the names right, sort of. Public schools are a group of highly respected and incredibly expensive schools. We also have private schools which charge for admission but generally are not boarding schools. Then we have grammar schools and state schools. 
Public schools are attended by the privileged elite and while I have never really heard much disdain from them, they do get perks (such as at least 2 Eton boys must be admitted to Kings College Cambridge every year), and they have a very high rate of entrance to Oxbridge. 
Private schools...I don't really see the point in them but evidently enough people do. I guess they have smaller classes, possibly better teaching (although that is dubious at best) and better facilities in some areas. But they're generally for upper-middle class people who want to seem wealthy but can't afford Eton/Harrow etc. 
Grammar schools (I went to one) are selective entrance, based either upon a test when children are still in primary school (aged 11) in maths, reading and writing. Or at 16, for A levels, they write their own examinations for each subject. They're state-funded and free. It really depends on your political viewpoint...some see them as great enhancers of social mobility, while others see them as the hubs of the middle-class. I have to say in my experience it was a mixture. The school was in the middle of a nice area so of course lots of local kids got in from middle class backgrounds, but equally many were from surrounding not-so-nice areas.
State schools are hit and miss. I also went to one (when I was 11-16) and it is considered a very good state school, but they have their problems, with lots of problem kids and such that other types of schools generally weed out early on. 

5. I don't, personally. But I know many people that do. I enjoyed wearing a suit for 6th form though, it did make me feel very professional. But I don't like how strict they are on things such as jewellery and facial hair and what not.

6. The UK is like the middle-ground between France and the US (having both French and American family I believe I can say this in fairly strong assurance I'm correct). We have school sports teams, mainly; Rugby, football, (field) hockey and netball (for girls). There are other niche sports too (for example I captained my school skiing team from when I was 7) but that depends on a teacher or parent will to give up their own time to establish it and run it. But they're not well supported like the American school teams seem to be. I think the highest attendance to one of my hockey games was 5 parents. 

And we do also have club teams for every sport pretty much. Some are few and far between but they're there if you look for them. We have a district&gt;county&gt;regional&gt;national system in most sports too but they tend to start at club level rather than school level. 

I'll just add that personally I much prefer the US system. Not for anything you've highlighted here particularly though. I prefer the system of much more emphasis on constant assessment and participation in class rather than one final exam. I am aware you still have final exams, but they make up a much lower proportion of your final grade.

I also prefer the university entrance system. I'm not so sure on the SATs as I am aware that students can be phenomenal at say...art, but awful at maths and english and that would screw them up (although I'm sure universities account for that and have ways of assessing those candidates, I just don't know what they are). But SATs would certainly suit me a lot better. And equally I like how they focus on students being well-rounded...work experience, community service, sports teams and societies in school. Universities here do not give a shit. You can be the biggest one-trick-pony in the world, but as long as you can get the grades, they'll take you, which is upsetting really. I've seen people with 3 A-stars, but absolutely no other accolades to their name, go to Oxbridge. Mean while kids who get AAA, are sports team captains, presidents of multiple societies, senior prefects, have Duke of Edinburgh and so on have all been rejected. It's nonsense. 
Finally I like how you *know* you've got into university in the US, assuming you keep up your GPA and whatnot. Here...it all banks on your final exams. You have offers...not a place.

This is how people talk about Balotelli and it scares the piss out of me because it's glaringly obvious that critics and fans convinced themselves of something that just isn't true.  I think he's a great player and I'm am thrilled that he signed for us, but not because I expect him to finally become world-class.  I expect him to put the ball in the net a fair amount of the time, and his stats imply that he can do that.  I don't think he'll even be our best goal-scorer this season, but I do think he gives our offense an extra threat that they desperately needed, not to mention more experience than most of the players we'd start up front.  Right now all I want is high-level football from Mario and if the rest of the team can't step up to the point where that's all we need to stay in the CL then the blame isn't on Balotelli.

The fact that the regeneration energy comes from time vortex energy also gets me.  The doctor says that prolonged exposure is how they got their start but that would mean that they would need to travel through the Vortex in order to gain that energy like River did.  But that seems weird to me that if everyone on the planet could time travel and had to in order to gain that energy then who would ever be on the planet?  My theory is that they learned how to imbue a body with the energy artificially.  That's why there is a set number of regenerations and how they gave the Doctor 13 more.

All that is theory but just saying they were all born Time Lords just doesn't make sense to me.  Where did that energy come from?  Why only 13 regenerations?  How can they give a new set of regenerations if it is biological?

The more people you put at a competitive disadvantage at birth, the less human resources you have that can improve/progress society. An even starting platform for all people in terms of education strikes me as a sensible thing to do for any open ideology, be it capitalism, socialism or communism. 

Perhaps under a more restrictive regime, such as a monarchy or an oligarchy, selective disenfranchisement from education makes sense, but when it comes to a society I imagine most people would want to live in, I am yet to hear a solid argument that would make me see any benefits the existence of private education could bring.

There's no indication that failure there means ""not a Time Lord,"" though. The simplest read of that sequence is that it's like a rite of passage ritual, not a transformation.

Also note that time travel isn't intrinsic to the Time Lords; they need machines to do it. Humans travel through time with the Doctor in the TARDIS without much trouble; the first indication that weird shit might ensue from prolonged human exposure to Time Lord tech was the whole River Song story, but that just supports the idea that Time Lords are aliens.

true,iheke,null,null,"I'm not sure if WindyCoys or @p_gascoigne are reading the rule correctly. The rule in full is:

""All 20 Clubs must include eight Home Grown players out of a squad of 25 for that Premier League season.

A Home Grown player will be defined as one who, irrespective of his nationality or age, has been registered with any club affiliated to the Football Association or the Football Association of Wales for a period, continuous or not, of three entire seasons or 36 months prior to his 21st birthday (or the end of the season during which he turns 21).

Clubs are able to supplement their squads with unlimited additional players under the age of 21 on 1st January in the year in which the season commences.

Changes to the squad list of 25 may be made during the period of a transfer window. So Clubs must declare their 25 at the end of August when the window shuts and then again at the end of January.""

Erik Lamela and Christian Eriksen were both 21 on 1st January 2014 (Eriksen is actually 22 now). So I would assume that they would continue to be exempt, if of course the rule is applied in the typical way (i.e. 21 AND under, rather than simply under 21 years old).

Zeki Fryers is currently 21 and turns 22 next week. Again, my view is that he would be exempt.

I think the best way to look at the Home Grown rule is to reverse it - i.e. Spurs may have 17 non-home grown players. Looked at this way, we have.

1. Lloris
2. Vorm
3. Friedel
4. Kaboul
5. Vertonghen
6. Chiriches
7. Paulinho
8. Sandro
9. Dembele
10. Holtby
11. Capoue
12. Chadli
13. Adebayor
14. Soldado

I think this means we have 3 Non-Home Grown Player slots remaining (exc. BAE) which means Fazio, Yedlin + one other can come in without any squad change.

If my reading of the rule is wrong and Eriksen and Lamela are included. It means we only have one slot remaining - which means Fazio and then we're in one-in one-out territory... (so, in order for Yedlin to come in Jan someone will need to make way).

Looking at the list generally, if you needed to make space for ""non-home grown players"" - you can kind of understand why the media are focussed on Holtby, Sandro and Chiriches - basically, these are the no-brainer moves in the list as all cost under £10m (£1.5m, £8m, 6m respectively) and will definitely make money and free up space in the right area. The downside in the logic is that Holtby looks a direct replacement for Eriksen and Chiriches is the closest we have for a Vertonghen replacement. This is why in my view Sandro (God Bless him) will be the one to bite the bullet, if we have to make space.

The more interesting question is Europe: http://www.danielgeey.com/uefa-and-its-amended-home-grown-player-rule/ with their strange variation of the Home Grown Player rule that has 4 Club trained and 4 association trained. Walker, Naughton and Fryers haven't been at the club long enough to get 36 months before their 21st birthday. Which means we NEED Bentaleb, Kane, Townsend and Lennon in the Europa League squad which probably suggest that the above will not be leaving in the very near future.",0,1409075252,null,0,false,0,ck12isp,t3_2ema3u,t1_ck12isp,t3_2ema3u,null,1427348714,0,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,0

I was disappointed with Carra's analysis last night, simply because he completely contradicted himself. Last season him and Neville went to great lengths to point out our inability to push up, and how staying deep allowed us to get caught out time and time again.

Last night, Man City were playing the ball was backwards, away from our goal, a trigger to push up and squeeze the space. The two new signings pushed up and the two pre-Rodgers players stayed 5 yards further back.

Some people have said that Lovren/Moreno were at fault, some people were saying that Skrtel/Johnson were at fault, who was actually right? Both and neither. There isn't a right or wrong way to defender when it comes to reactive vs proactive, it's whatever the manager wants and it's pretty clear what Rodgers wants.

Look at the first choice defenders we've signed under Rodgers - Sakho, Lovren, Manquillo, Moreno - they are all aggressive, front foot, proactive defenders. Rodgers is an aggressive, assertive manager, he wants us to take the game into our control, not be reactive and passive.

Our defense has a mess yesterday, but it clearly spelled out difference between past and present defenders and where we are heading. Johnson's injury might be a blessing disguise (not in a cuntish way, which has been embarassing) but it will allow a natural fitting defender (Manquillo) to get a run of games.

I really don't know what's going on with Sakho, hopefully Rodgers' being fair to Skrtel's form last season and giving him the first crack at nailing down a place, but I'd like to Manquillo-Lovren-Sakho-Moreno sooner rather than later, because it might not be the best defense in the league, but they're all on the same page as each other, as well as Rodgers.",0,1409075287,null,0,1409079220,0,ck12jgq,t3_2en4um,t1_ck12jgq,t3_2en4um,null,1427348705,21,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,21

Humans are bad at healthcare decisions because It's more or less random, this means you need to insure against it. This part is not controversial anywhere.

The problem now comes when you get to buying, information asymmetry makes it a bit of a crapshoot, NHS covering the lot tempered this. Look at the level of medical bankruptcies in countries without public systems.

Old poor people dying is only bad business if you insure them in first place which given the choice companies simply don't google ""pre existing condition"". Companies won't go around killing people that's a strawmam they simply won't do loss making business.
Obama made it illegal to discriminate on these grounds that simply left a broken market.

Natural monopolies are well documented google it. The text book example is water.
If I own the water company in an area you can't compete with me, if you build out new pipes to each house your saddled with debt that I don't have so you can't ever beat me on price. Happens when marginal costs and running costs are verry low and capital costs absurdly high. Try setting up a new reservoir isn't ever going to make money. A private monopoly is worse than a state one because it lacks any oversight.

We don't have this in most industries because cost of entry isn't prohibitive if I try and exploit my position you can open a rival firm and compete, the system corrects its self. That's ideal but doesn't work in some industries.

There are also edge cases like trains where its a web of pseudo monopolies.

true,malibu1731,null,null,"To answer your number 5, the majority of my schools had a uniform but I spent two years at a school which didn't and I honestly prefer the uniform for a number of reasons.

* Firstly it stops school turning into a fashion show and the pressure that comes along with that. Obviously kids all kids feel like they should have the most fashionable stuff but if you go to school every day wearing the wrong trainers or whatever you have a pretty shit time. 

* It makes it easier to decide what to wear because you wear the same thing every day, you have the same white shirts or grey skirt and you put it on every day. You don't have to think about whats clean, what goes with each other, whats cool etc etc.

* It also teaches you to be smart, which is a great skill to have when you leave to start work!

Those are the reasons its good when you're a kid, but looking back there are other reasons having a school uniform is good:  

* It gives you a sense of pride on your school, you belong to this school, you wear the tie, the badge whatever. Everyone who sees you knows which school you go to and it makes you feel like you belong to something. 

* Its also good for people on low incomes, school uniforms are generally similar sorts of colours, unless you go to a fancy school, so all the big shops sell cheap school uniforms this time of year. And also having the same uniform means you can often get it second hand from siblings or friends or just pick it up at car boot sales. Way back in the day it was not unheard of for kids to wear their school uniform to church or formal occasions as it was only the decent clothing they had.

The fact is, if ""women stop getting drunk"" then rape convictions probably would drop.

Katie Russel's comment seems like a canned response including deferring of responsibility from women, a criticism of the patriarchal legal system, and a stock % statistic about rape without even attempting to refute the Judge's actual comments.

true,rough_outline,lfc68,,"As I said, Man City were moving the ball backwards and we were putting pressure on the ball carrier, that is a trigger for pushing up.

You drop back when there is space in behind and the opposition is moving the ball forward and/or not under pressure.

The rules, exceptions, triggers, whatever you want to call them, are very simple. The problem is cohesion, understanding and decision making. Rodgers has singled out Lovren as a communicator, I think he's going to be our 'voice' in the backline, if he decides to push up, the entire defense should push up.

It's defending 101, but the first step is the back four being on the same page which they weren't. There's a reason Lovren/Moreno pushed up and Skrtel/Johnson didn't, don't believe that Rodgers is teaching them any differently in training, or is any less of an 'expert'.

It's unfortunate that our toughest away game came so early on in the season, because against other teams we'd be able to paper over the cracks, and that would give us time for our defense to acclimatise to one another.

EDIT - Think back to how Demichelis marshaled the Man City defense last season, when they were down to 10 men against Hull, and the amount of times they caught Hull offside.

When The Doctor and Clara are trapped in the restaurant booth, the shot is cutting back and forth from face to face as they talk. At one point, the shot is on Clara saying something, then it cuts back to The Doctor ... and suddenly he's struggling to push the sonic screwdriver up out of his pocket.

So ... where was the setup? I think there's a 15-20 second snippet of dialogue missing from the scene.

Something like:

Clara: Can't you just use your sonic?

TD: Yes, but it's in my pocket, and I can't reach it.

Clara: Well, if you can drop it on the floor, then I can pick it up with my feet, and pass it to you.

TD: Oh, good idea!

Okay, so it probably would've been better written than that. :-) But you get the point: The two characters need to get the idea for the plan - and we, the audience, need to see/hear them get that idea for the plan - before they jump right into executing it.

In the scene as broadcast on BBC America, the conversation that they're having simply stops dead with the last shot of Clara, and then jumps immediately to The Doctor working the sonic out of his pocket, without the two of them ever having said one word about it.

So, did BBC America get a faulty master from the London mothership?

Or, was there perhaps some slang word in there, that's perfectly innocent in the UK, but filthy in the US, that they had to edit out (the reverse of the word ""fanny,"" if you will)?

Or, was this just the sloppiest piece of editing in the history of Doctor Who?

Here's another question: Did anyone here see the episode in the UK? Or Canada, or anywhere else in the Commonwealth? I'd love to know if there was a chunk of dialogue that was aired elsewhere, that was missing in the US broadcast.

Don't skip lectures or classes unless you're ill.

Also, make sure you meet all your deadlines! Even if it's just homework for a class and not an actual marked piece, make sure you meet that deadline. It's good practise and it means you don't fall behind!

true,Kousetsu,eng-lincolnshire,Humberside motherfucker!,"I'm gonna say this : 
I'm not a racist. I'm really not. At all. I never, ever thought that I was ever gonna have to say that. I'm a guardian reading, feminist, bleeding heart liberal all the way through and quite frankly I find the idea of racism absurd.    
I grew up in a tiny village. I knew one Asian family and one Filipino family, they were the only minorities I knew. Both were absolutely lovely.    
But I moved to Manchester and I discovered this other side to Asian culture. I don't judge people by their skin colour, I judge them by how they treat me. And many Asian men have treated me as their equal, usually the ones who work educated jobs and have lived here for a while, and, I really hate myself when I type this, but aren't completely immersed in uk-asian culture.    
I work a customer facing role. One of my past jobs required me to do home visits alone. I have had men refuse to speak to me. Bring little girls to speak to me because they were the only other women in the house. Shout and scream at me at the drop of the hat and be extremely rude to me, call me names and so on. It was only ever Pakistani men that treated me this way.    
So, while I wouldn't push away all Pakistani men, I naturally become on my guard around them until they treat me with respect.     
And I say all of this as a middle-class (looking and acting at least) professionally dressed woman.   
I'd hate to think how these men would consider escorts, or disadvantaged young girls, or anyone else they see as lower than them if that's how they treat me.        
I can understand why some women may want to push these men away altogether because it is the easiest way to consider their own safety.   
And unfortunetly, the problems ingrained in this won't come from these women just changing their minds about these men. It has to come from within the UK-Pakistani community itself, but the first step is to recognise that it has a problem.",0,1409077123,null,0,false,0,ck13j03,t3_2emih6,t1_ck13j03,t1_ck10rep,null,1427348174,22,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,22

Basically the music you hear on BBC Asian Network and so forth and that that is played in these clubs is called Bhangra and it's a Punjabi music based on folk songs from back home. The overwhelming majority of artists are Sikhs and the origins of the music lie in the celebrations we'd have at harvest time us being agrarian people.

This is about Child A who was **12 years old**:

However, the CID (criminal investigation department) representative argued against the category of sexual abuse being used because he thought that Child A had been **‘100% consensual in every incident’**.

A child under 16 can't give consent, why were they given a caution when they had committed statutory rape? This is not even a grey area, they had admitted they'd done it.

I'm sure you'd be fine with small claims, and I agree it'd be silly to get a solicitor involved in these circumstances.

IMO the important thing to do is just have something written down which specifies that this is a loan (so it can't later be construed as a gift) and shows that she plans to repay the whole sum according to a schedule. 

I don't think you're going to have to sue your girlfriend, but if there's an acrimonious breakup the important thing is to have in writing that it's a loan not a gift. You don't have to worry about all the same things a bank would have to worry about - a court would probably take into account the circumstances, but she's not going to seriously challenge it, anyway.

If you google ""loan template uk"" you'll find loads of examples - I'd copy paste into Word and edit it to suit yourself. I'd probably add a clause that it must be paid by cheque or direct debit, so there's no later disputing ""but I paid you cash that month"" - such a clause shouldn't be necessary, but it's the sort of claim that can be made during acrimonious breakups.

IMO the most important thing is that you're both in amicable agreement that you'll have an informal written contract for the loan - if she were to say ""don't you trust me?"" then I'd be concerned, whereas if she says ""yes, of course that's fair and sensible"" then she'd seem less likely to rip you off.

We live in a civilised country, so no-one gets thrown in prison for debt anymore so if she's really desperate then she needs to get advice and consider things like insolvency/bankruptcy.

Sure, I could tear them apart by saying it was stereotypical to play up the whole ""we're lesbians in Victorian England, we're so sexy and one of us hates men"" thing but I'd rather just enjoy it for what it is. To be fair, Vastra is an ancient, haughty lizard and of the two of them Jenny may be the more nuanced character. I think they complement each other and if they actually were in their own series the relationship could be fleshed out more. I enjoyed Jenny's line about loving Vastra and Vastra's protectiveness of Jenny and yes, I guffawed at what I think of as the ""paint me like one of your French maids"" joke.

I also think we'll start seeing high scoring games again once Balotelli gives Sturridge some more freedom by giving the opposing CB's something else to think about. I think Sturridge does better in a two striker partnership rather than being the sole striker.

All in all I'm optimistic. As Rodgers said we got no points from the corresponding two fixtures last season, so we're already ahead on points even with a lot of work left to do.

But I would argue that, due to the fact that rapists actively seek out vulnerable people, stating that ""women should not get drunk"" is unhelpful; rapists would simply find someone else. Another important aspect to consider when looking at rape conviction rates is how the victims are treated by the justice system, and that is often very very poorly. Just look at the reports on the recent cases in Rotheram to see that even children are treated with heinous amounts of disrespect by police officers and other social/criminal services, which all contribute to victims of rape being very much disinclined to press charges and have their rapist convicted.

If the jury can't be certain either way, they can't return a guilty verdict - that, unfortunately, is for the best because we don't like locking people up for things they might not have done.

dude go to every indian resteraunt or takeaway. look at the bus drivers, and the taxi drivers. look at cleaners. most of them are **not** unemployed and are doing the shit tier jobs. second and third gen are at universities studying finance, law and medicine.

whats funny is that actually the whole reason for the bangladeshi and pakistani (and indian) diaspora's setting up in england is quite simply, they were asked and tasked with coming in and rebuilding the infrastructure of the United Kingdom in the wake of the second world war. They worked the car plants and factory jobs when they first came in because the United Kingdom required that sort of labour to keep growing and had a population in the 60s and 70s that simply were not fucking and reproducing enough. That is to say it was stagnant.

Then those jobs dried up, and them (asian communities) having already established themselves in england for 20-30 plus years, decided to stay. 

Its as simple as that really. 

And i mean if you're going to want to go down the fairness value and immigration stakes i would have to say the British empire irrevocably fucking up India generationally for several hundred years via divide and rule and other policies, east india company to name a few, causing and exaacerabating the bengal famine that was likened to a huge genocide (grain tax was taken without being put into a welfare pot, living millions to starve) would mean that the diaspora coming and staying over here is just one large case of chickens coming home to roost really.

Those are both very explicit statements which leaves you very little wiggle room. It in effect equates inebriation to being under 16, the law says they cannot consent, therefore any sex with a child below that age is statutory rape. You say an inebriated person cannot consent, therefore any sex with one is rape, regardless of their personal feelings about the incident or if they desire to press charges.

You then suggested it was fine if both parties were drunk, I simply asked how you would go about determining that to secure a conviction, since there are clearly different levels of drunkenness.

for example:

""But the Manchester City defense would not allow them to attack from the middle. City’s defense would force Liverpool to attack from the wings and would manage to deal with any incoming crosses""

could be a bit more smoother and detailed:

""But the Manchester City defense would not allow them to attack from the middle.""

can be written as:

""But the City Defence, consisting of the now familiar Centreback partnership of Kompany and Demichelis, remained effective in preventing liverpool from exploiting the centre of the pitch..."" 

then you could add detail why you think so

 e.g. ""a task largely aided by the arrival of new signing Fernando from Porto who joined city for a fee of 12m pounds"" (extra detail is always good and it makes you look very legitimate)

and

""City’s defense would force Liverpool to attack from the wings and would manage to deal with any incoming crosses""

can be written as:

""Realising thier predicament liverpool sought to the wings as an outlet of attack with Sterling and Coutinho testing  Pablo Zabaleta and Gael Clichy. Though the city fullbacks performed admirably the inevitable cross or two was delivered into the city box, though more often than not, comfortably cleared by the ever present Vincent Kompany""

The way I approached hazard perception was to consider anything that would cause you to adjust your direction or your speed as a hazard. Click whenever you see a hazard, or when the status of a hazard changes. 

For example:

A pedestrian walking along the nearside pavement moves closer to the road *click*, the pedestrian looks over his shoulder showing they may intend to cross the road *click*, pedestrian then crosses causing the driver to slow *click*.

Don't feel like you are clicking too much, I had one clip of a busy town high street with potential hazards everywhere. I must have clicked 12+ times, nearly half filling the screen with red flags. I thought I would be failed for the clip but wasn't.

true,takaznik,capaldi,Capaldi,"The Doctor never had any romantic intent towards any companion until the revival. The Doctor had never even kissed a companion until the TV Movie with the 8th Doctor and even then it was more of a ""We survived! I'm the 8th Doctor and I'm excitable time to kiss Grace!"" not really romantic intent. I can't even recall a time in the classic series that even flirted with a companion directly, first time I can think of that was 9 with his ""I think you need a Doctor"" to Rose. 

There's probably a small chunk of people that will stop watching since the Doctor isn't a attractive young guy anymore. Are they all young females? Definitely not. Will it cause ratings and viewership drops? Probably not. 

Typically if a companion carries over after a regeneration they're the ""audience surrogate"" for an episode or two so that everyone learns who the Doctor is now that he changed his face. It happened with Rose during 9/10, it happened with Sarah Jane during 3/4, it happened with Adric/Tegan/Nyssa with 4/5, etc etc. In fact I think there's only like 5 times where a companion wasn't around when the Doctor regenerated: 2-3, 7 - 8, 8 - War, War - 9, 10 - 11. (I guess kind of 6-7, but not really.. you'd have to watch it).

The show is going back to its roots while maintaining the modern feel. The Doctor isn't your boyfriend or your heart throb or anything like that.

But I'll illustrate what I'm saying with an example from a different show.

In supernatural season 7, episode 20 there's a character named Charlie played by Felicia Day that's infiltrating a building for the Winchester brothers with an earpiece so they can guide her.

At some point she needs to enter a room and the guard won't leave. Dean Winchester tells her just to hit on him and he'll let her pass. She answer he's not her type. Dean suggest she just imagine a hot guy. She reply back he's not her type because he's not a girl.

What ensues is that Dean suggests she try anyway and he'll tell her what to say. So a womanizer ends up guiding a lesbian on hitting on a guy. It's awkwardly hilarious.

The scene serves no purpose to the story, it could have been cut easily, especially since Felicia's character was meant to show up only in that episode and didn't need much development. But it's a great and hilarious scene.

The're no subtlety at all involved here and her sexual orientation is pretty blatant. But there's no ""hey guy, just in case you forgot I'm still a lesbian"".

It's not a case of the defendant having to prove beyond reasonable doubt that they obtained consent, but rather they must be able to demonstrate in some manner that they sought and obtained that consent - s1(2) of the Sexual Offences Act sayeth:

&gt; Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents

Where rape is committed if A did not reasonably believe that B consented - so by that very token the onus is on the defendant to show that he reasonably believed that the victim did consent. How he does that is a different matter - it's not for him to prove beyond reasonable doubt, but he needs to be able to demonstrate it somehow.

1) Sanctions: the jobcentre plus are sanctioning people no benefits like there is no tomorrow, if you are sanctioned generally your choices are really limited.

2) Cost of living increasing: (gas, electric food etc.), just existing is costing far more, people who were once able to afford things now cant and at the end of the month just cannot make ends meet, your choices are crime, payday lenders or borrowing from friends.

3) We want it all and we want it now: We as a society spend far too much time wanting, banks aid people in this and people end up paying interest back, chances are before the banking crisis most people could manage this, but when cost of living shoots up that £X you are paying in interest really bites.

4) We are more lonely than ever, no family/community to help people out.

You can find more infos here: http://www.trusselltrust.org/foodbank-projects , i do a lot of work in community, also mental health so i hear some really horrific stories. I also grew up on a council estate, mum having to chose between loaf of bread and tenner on electric meter type thing.

Ultimately i think we as a society are selfish and would rather issues like this are swept under the carpet, we are scared and the media helps us put all the blame onto some Romanian immigrant who came over here and took all of our jobs.

If people really thought about it, the people who are earning millions and millions are the ones who are really at fault here and government ultimately props people like that up.

If you're going for the total cock look then yeah wear a turban but I would really advise against. I've only seen them at Punjabi/Sikh weddings.

For women you can either go with the [Punjabi suit (aka salwar kameez)](http://www.fashionwebz.com/image/cache/data/angelic-off-white-party-wear-salwar-kameez-800x1100.jpg), [lehanga](http://mineforeverapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Blue-and-Orange-Lehanga.jpg) or [saree](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HplrsruNfxI/UUAr51kpimI/AAAAAAAAAig/hYpuO3WV6AI/s1600/Beautiful+Akshara+Saree+Collection+2013++Akshara+Saree+Designs+5.jpg). Salwar is like the men's kurta as it's a tunic with trousers that taper at the ankle. Lehanga is a top with a skirt. Saris look awesome and there are several ways to wear it (depends on the region) but most second generation girls don't know any of them and get their mums to help! So your SO will have to keep that in mind but anyone will be glad to help.

Whatever she goes for no one will care if she has a backless or strapless blouse/top. And women don't wear coats in cold weather (though older women wear a cardy over their sari) they wear a shawl over their shoulders. For shoes she can go with the mojari or just normal shoes/heels etc.

As for colours, again white and black aren't great but it's fine. But red and gold are **strictly forbidden** as that's bridalwear and would be like wearing a white dress to a normal wedding.

1) Most planets he visits multiple times, he ends up in generally the same area. Earth is the exception, as he's hung out with Marco Polo, Aztecs, etc. It could just be he's not very good at piloting a TARDIS. (During his career with the Time Lords, before the first episode, he was an ambassador... but usually had a crew working the TARDIS).

2) Especially after his first incarnation (Hartnell), he mainly tended to deal with alien trouble, rather than other social issues (regardless of planet). Even on Peladon which was having trouble between the ruling class and the citizenry... the Doctor arrived when there were Delegates from the Galactic Federation to have Peladon join.

3) Even though he says he's a helper, he generally only gets involved with things that he ends up having direct contact with (a lot of people are actually like that.) And he pretty much ends up having direct contact with wherever he randomly lands the TARDIS.

4) There's a lot of doctors in the world, many don't have the fortitude or desire to go to 3rd world countries. And while I may be banned from the subreddit, the Doctor is not an infallible moral angel! He seems to want his own level of creature comforts, even when he's helping others.

You said ""inebriated people cannot consent"", which if it was true in law would make any sex with a drunk person statutory rape.

You questioned that line of reasoning by saying that a drunk person who had sex that wasn't rape simply wouldn't press charges.

That isn't how it works, if the police believe they have evidence a crime was committed and they have a reasonable chance of securing a conviction they will pursue it, regardless of the victims wishes.

By no means am I saying drop Coutinho because of the slow start, it's just that Sterling has been consistent, so we should keep him and perhaps use Coutinho as an impact sub for the game.

Umbridge had this attitude that the Ministry could do no wrong which is much more fleshed out in the book.  Since she believes whole-heartedly in the correctness of the Ministry, Voldemort could not be back (Cornelius said so!), therefore Dumbledore is a senile old moron for believing Harry Potter's lies.  People would listen to Harry Potter which means he's a threat to the veracity of the Ministry's claims, therefore we must discredit or even get rid of him at any cost - including sending dementors after him and an ""innocent"" muggle.

Imelda Staunton (the actress who played Umbridge) got the characterization down really well and made the character very unlikeable in her smug confidence, but if you read the book you'll find yourself actively wanting to throttle Umbridge and cheering when the centaurs carry her off (and it's implied that they introduce her to some good old fashioned centaur rape).",0,1409084579,null,0,false,0,ck17m9v,t3_2ematf,t1_ck17m9v,t1_ck141dd,null,1427346266,3,false,doctorwho,t5_2qhek,3

In Scotland our curriculum is called the Curriculum for Excellence, it runs from age 3 right up to 15 (Nursery, 7 years of primary school and the first three years of secondary school). The first three years you are expected to take a broad general education. 

After that, for seconday 4 (S4), the final compulsory year of education for most, they have to make some choices. For most authorities this is 6 subjects that they can take. For most these will be qualifications called national fours and fives, which are roughly GCSE ish. Not directly equivalent as you take fewer, but more in depth.  S5 and S6 are more of the same, it's all modular, you can do some more N4s and N5s if you fancy, or go do some highers (which I thought were going to be rebranded N6s? - AS level in England) or advanced highers (A levels). You can mix and match too, so say you did N5 French in S4, and then Higher in S5, but decided you actually wanted to do some German again, you could pick that up at whatever level again in S6. There's much more flexibility right up to later in school. 

In ye olden days, most folk left after S5 to go to Uni; that's why honours courses tend to be 4 years in Scotland compared to 3 years in England, because you left school a year earlier. These days though, most folk I know (who are academically inclined) tend to stay on for S6 as well, as they don't want to go uni before they're 18, and S6 is either a chance to pick up some subjects you missed out on taking earlier, or ones you failed, or maybe a wee change of direction after not enjoying something. 

Is that the kind of stuff you're after? Are you wanting more info on the curriculum? It's kinda new and incorporates a lot of learning external to the classroom and stuff, and breaks down barriers between subjects. You could be sitting learning some maths while you're in geography and the like, is the general idea. Making it more realistic to real life where you don't use things in the abstract. There's a bit of a push this month in a report also to have much less assessment. Some folk have come out and said that if folk are going to sit a higher, there's no point in them sitting the exam for the National 5, that's just wasting time when they can be moving on and won't need the N5 certificate - the summative assessment should just be carried out at the highest point the child can reach. Others argue that that's too risky as they won't have practice of exam conditions, and if they muck it up they've nothing else to fall back on. Plus, politicians will be loathe to adopt that, as it means their exams results will look much worse (they'll have fewer people passing if they're not sitting the exams in the first place). Will have to see how that debate plays out. This was the first year of the N4s and N5s, and this coming year is the first year of the new Highers, so we'll wait and see what happens.

The reason I recommend a classic car is because the money you are investing is in the car and not the insurance. When you sell the car you will get most of it back. You don't get back any money of your insurance. 

I then drove a ford focus, £1200 insurance, even though I had driven a year and was 2 years older. Now, at 21 I have a ford Ka. Crappy car but insurance is £500 fully comp. It gets better but this is my advice. Also don't t lie on your policy, it will bite you in the ass if you have an accident.

Further, they identified that capacity to consent may evaporate well before a complainant becomes unconscious. **Whether this is so or not, however, depends on the facts of the case.**.

true,IMKridegga,tom-baker,Tom Baker,"I personally suspect that the Doctor chose Caecilius' face because it reminds him of the value of saving people.  Letting Gallifrey burn to save the universe is rather like letting Pompeii burn to save Earth.  The difference comes in when we see that the Doctor didn't save anyone from the Time War, he just shelved it, lost his memory, and ran.  But in Pompeii, he saved a family.

I've noticed that at multiple points during the New Series, the Doctor has been asked to make similar choices to that which he made at the end of the Time War, and every time he's chosen something different.  In Parting of the Ways, he found he couldn't bring himself to wipe out all life on Earth to stop the daleks.  In The Fires of Pompeii, he chose to let the city burn, but save one family.  I believe that these represent stops on the Doctor's own mental journey to decide what to do about the Time War.

After all, he's really done nothing about it.  We thought he ended it, but in Day of the Doctor, it was revealed that he just shelved it, freezing time around it and trapping it in a pocket universe.  The Doctor knows, or at least thinks he knows, that one day he'll have to do something about the Time War and probably expects that it will be up to this incarnation (Capaldi) to do it.  So Eleven, in his last moments, sent a message to his future self to remind him that even if he can't save everyone from the Time War, he can still save something.

And even if Twelve isn't the one to put an end to the Time War once and for all, at least that message of mercy is still imprinted in the Doctor's DNA.  And perhaps the message won't end up actually applying to the Time War, but to something else instead.

And by the way, on the subject of Twelve's face, I think sharing it with Caecilius is what the Curator was referring to in Day of the Doctor.  It is an ""old favorite"" because the moment in Pompeii when the Doctor saved Caecilius and his family is probably one of the Doctor's favorite memories - the moment of his realization that even if he can't save everyone, he can still save someone and that's better than saving no one.  Five said that a man is the sum of his memories and a Timelord is even more so.  If that's the case, then such a good memory is probably worth a lot to the Doctor.

.

One of the pieces of evidence (among much more, I just remember this one) was in the episode Hide from Season 7. They were investigating a supposedly haunted house, but it was really some alien creature and time travel stuff.

&gt;PALMER (describing the haunted house): Oh, she's real. In the seventeenth century, a local clergyman saw her. He wrote that her presence was accompanied by a dreadful knocking, **as if the Devil himself demanded entry** 

Later, The Doctor traveled back in time and found that it was himself in the past that caused the haunting noises in the house, including the knocking on the door they were talking about.

That devil was The Doctor.

.

This is all certainly very leading, grasping at straws and drawing connections where they don't exist.

But it has been a theme throughout the revived show - The Doctor claims to be benevolent, but brings trouble and misery to those closest to him and problems for the whole world.

He picks up young and impressionable people and takes them on wild adventures where they could meet terrible fates much worse than death - always promising fun and adventure, but always gives them danger and hardship instead.

Sometimes it seems that the world would be better off without him, he attracts all these freaky aliens and other dangers to the Earth. He always saves the day, but when you stand back and look, it seems like he caused the problems that he eventually solved.

.

Of course the most reasonable answer to all of these questions is - because it wouldn't be a very interesting show if there weren't problems to overcome.

true,OptioMkIX,,bus pass elvis is the only politician i can believe in,"Essentially, in 2002-06 she apparently wrote a rather damning report of the entire CSE situation on behalf of the Home Office in Rotherham and was forcibly ejected from the organisation (Rotherham, that is)as a result of these unpalatable home truths. The information she researched has no references from that date to the present day, like it was scrubbed from the organisation. Indeed, as it was part of a larger Home Office research project, the Rotherham part is conspicuously incomplete or absent from the final document.

&gt; Dr Heal's reports present a vivid and alarming picture of the links between sexual
exploitation, drugs, gangs and violent crime in Rotherham from 2002 to 2006. They
were widely distributed to middle and senior managers in all key agencies. There is
no record of any formal, specific discussion of these reports in Council papers, in
ACPC minutes or in the Rotherham Safeguarding Children Board minutes made
available to the Inquiry.

&gt;10.3 The Bristol and Sheffield projects were funded from January 2001 until March 2003,
and the Rotherham project from January 2001 until July 2002. **The final report on the
research from the Home Office included a footnote, stating that Rotherham was not
funded for the second year due to 'implementation problems'.** The University of
Luton's final evaluation report did not include the Rotherham project.

&gt;10.4 A document headed 'Chapter Four: Key Achievements of the Home Office Pilot '
was made available to the Inquiry by the Council.** It referred to the evaluation results
of the pilot in Rotherham, though the town is not named.** It provided a descriptive
background to CSE within the town going back to 1996, drawing on the work of Risky
Business, which is referred to in the report as 'the project'. **The rest of the report
containing the overview of the aims and objectives of the pilot, literature review,
methodology and recommendations, is missing.**

&gt;10.5 The report was not dated but we understand that it was written in 2002.

&gt;10.6 The present Chief Executive and Executive Director of Children's Services **saw the
report referred to below for the first time in 2012.**

So this important document was obscured for at least six years from the 2006 date, and maybe as many as ten years from 2002. Outstanding. Lets see what was in it!

&gt;10.8 **The examples of poor practice and negative attitudes were far more prevalent**. These included:

&gt;a) Awareness of CSE and interest in it were not widespread. Effective interventions were lacking;

&gt;b) Some professionals were working as individuals rather than seeking inter-agency solutions;

&gt;c) **Information was not being shared with the Police, and Strategy meetings were not being called by children’s social care**;

&gt;d) **The 'mapping exercise' devised by Risky Business that cross-referenced a large amount of data on victims and perpetrators was not well received by the Police. No charges were brought against alleged perpetrators, nor was any investigation undertaken.**

&gt;e)** The Police had responded reluctantly to missing person reports, as a 'waste of time'. Some young women had been threatened with arrest for wasting police time;**

&gt;f) **The young women concerned were often seen by the Police as being deviant or promiscuous. The adult men with whom they were found were not questioned;**

&gt;g) A database was developed to provide consistent recording of CSE-related information across agencies. Owing to a dispute between these agencies, it was not used;

&gt;h) Possibly as a result of their experience, parents were often not reporting a missing child since they saw it as a waste of time;

&gt;i) **Professionals were reluctant to be named as a source of information in prosecution, fearing for their safety. Some Police said that if young people were not prepared to help themselves by making complaints against their abusers and giving evidence, they would take no further action on the case;**

&gt;j) Despite ACPC procedures, there was no consistent way of addressing the issue of CSE. Many professionals were unaware of it; and

&gt;k) Some professionals were cautious about working together and sharing information.** Some feared an increase in workload. Some, especially the Police, made personal judgements about the young women involved.**

&gt;10.9 According to the researcher, attempts to raise many of the concerns described above with senior personnel were met with defensiveness and hostility.

If you continue reading Chapter 10 you see that Dr Heal wrote a letter outlining her concerns to the local police district commander (rotherham) and chief constable of the yorkshire constabulary. She was then told never to go over council's heads again by both the council and the rotherham district commander. She wrote the report as she was instructed but before she submitted it to the Home Office, she was dragged over the coals by senior Rotherham council &amp; police figures, was suspended on trumped up charges of gross misconduct and falsifying information. She was then confined to an office for the remainder of her tenure there without access to any information on case files, or in fact, anything.

At the time of this investigation, the District Commander remembered the letter, but had ""no recollection"" of the furore that followed, which stretches the belief of other people interviewed who were present around the same time.

Additionally, she was completely exonerated by this investigation.

&gt;10.18 **Much of what was contained in this report, and in particular the criticisms and
concerns of the research officer, has been confirmed by the Inquiry from other
sources.** The Inquiry case-file reading exercise covered six out of those ten cases
that formed her case studies. Apart from a very small number of minor details (e.g. a
slight variation in the date of an event), we found the cases studies to be entirely
consistent with our own reading of the files, and we considered them to evidence a
high standard of professional judgement and accuracy. **The secrecy around this
report, the discrepancies in the accounts we received from senior people and the
treatment of the researcher were all deeply troubling to the Inquiry team. *They have
inevitably led to suspicion of collusion and intended cover-up.* If the senior people
concerned had paid more attention to the content of the report, more might have
been done to help children who were being violently exploited and abused.**

I have already quoted far too much of this report because in all honesty it makes me fucking raging angry. The amount of backstabbing, covering up and dishonesty, simply to make officials lives easier or cover up their incompetence or collusion makes my piss boil.

There should be something akin to an Inquisition going on in Rotherham as a result of this report.",0,1409086555,null,0,1409087958,0,ck18qfh,t3_2envha,t1_ck18qfh,t3_2envha,null,1427345745,3,false,BritishPolitics,t5_2qo7h,3

Of course there are, no one's going to deny that. Modern stories often have this theme as it is a draw to a lot of people. 

There are many types of fans - there's the hardcore fan who's watched the classic series, listened to the audios, read the comics or novels, etc. There's middle of the road kind of fan who watches the show but maybe doesn't delve as far into the lore as the hardcore fan does, but they probably catch the show every week and don't have any qualms about Capaldi because they're watching the show because they think it's good. Then there's the fan that watch the show because the like actor x and may stop watching after actor x leaves, hell I've done this to shows myself - I never finished watching the last season of The Office because I just couldn't take it anymore without Steve Carrell. 

I think Jenna Coleman is a total hottie (I also thought the same of Freema Agyeman) but I watch the show because I love it. When Martha left and was replaced by Catherine Tate I didn't bat an eye (well thats sort of a lie, but it's because Catherine Tate grinds my gears that I didn't really like her) when Jenna leaves I won't go anywhere either. 

The issue in this thread isn't that you're a new fan who doesn't know anything, it's that you signaled out a group.

true,ashpow,null,null,"As jylg has said, volunteering is a good way to fill your time but try to find something related to the field you would like to work or somewhere that is likely to give you some responsibility. Also, be prepared to have to rationalise volunteering to the job centre- some advisers see it as an excuse to not be working or even that you may be covering benefit fraud. 

I've signed on for 2 periods, both for about 2 months. I've never had any real horror stories although my housing benefit was delayed by 6 weeks the first time round (luckily I had a very understanding landlord).

My only really practical advice is to keep a record of all your dealing with the  Job centre 9I used a box file for letters etcc). They will want you to keep records of your job searches and should provide you with a form to use as a diary. As much as this is helpful to you, it shows them that you are making an effort and sends a better message than providing them with a scrap of paper.

I found it easier to make lists of each days searches on a A4 notepad, with notes on who I had contacted, if I had phoned them, emailed etc... and what version of my CV i had given. Basically you want to make it as easy for yourself to keep track of any applications as well as being able to show easily to your advisor that you are actually looking for work.

Also, if you do start having any problems make a record of who you have spoken to and what they said. You might get contradictory advice and it helps to have something to refer to. 

Good luck and stay positive- your next job could be just round the corner. ",0,1409088090,null,0,false,0,ck19jx0,t3_2emxls,t1_ck19jx0,t3_2emxls,null,1427345363,2,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,2

""PasC"" is an abbreviation; it's pronounced ""pea as sea,"" and it stands for ""program as completed."" Meaning, someone takes the final shooting script, watches the final edit, and modifies the shooting script, based on any changes that were made in editing and post-production.

The PasC scripts are used to create the closed captions. They're also what's translated into other languages, to use in creating the subtitles for foreign airing and/or home video release.

All of which is to say: the scripts were undoubtedly in Miami so that BBC Lat Am could use them to create Spanish and Portuguese subtitles; which means that they were PasC scripts; which means that they reflect the final edit of the program, not (necessarily) what was in the original script.

Which means that, yep, this was the sloppiest piece of filming and editing ever seen in Doctor Who.

I'd have to watch it again to be sure, but I don't remember anything that showed us The Doctor trying to get the sonic out of his coat; it just looked like he was struggling with his bonds.

Also, those notes in the script - ""like it's standard procedure,"" and ""like a routine they've been through before"" - are curious.

If they were in the original script, then the director and editor did a terrible job of making that tone come through on the screen.

Well, perhaps the ability to 'self destruct' wasn't put in it, but instead it just wasn't programmed to *not* kill itself. I know it's semantics and everything, but there's a difference. It was probably programmed to self-repair, but there may not have been an explicit rule against suicide.

The creators may have thought ""why would a robot want to kill itself?"" and not added any rules against it. Or they may have been thinking along the lines of Asimov's laws, where a robot will protect it's existence, but can endanger itself to save a human/if ordered to. 

Obviously I'm not saying the three laws apply here, what with all the people getting killed by the android, but that they may have worded the programming loosely enough that the androids were more flexible in how they act.

Ajax- He won with the CL with [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1995_UEFA_Champions_League_Final) squad. A lot of those names (both De Boers, Seedorf, Rijkard, Van Der Sar, and our very own Edgar Davids!) ended up in Italy in the next two years, at a time when Serie A was the best league in the world full stop. You could make the argument that LvG won it because he did it his way, but he hasn't won the CL since nor has Ajax produced a team rivaling the 1995 CL winning squad, IMO.  

Barcelona: He tried to export a lot of the Dutchmen and blew up with the Catalan/Spanish media as well as the backroom. This really does put his absolutely explosive personality on exhibition. He was playing in a Liga pre-Galacticos, and Madrid were putting all their resources into winning their seventh CL by that time. 

Bayern Munich-Bested by Klopp when he was appointed manager of Borussia Dortmund in his second season. 

I think he's up there with the greats, but like you said, with hindsight in mind. He's Bielsa like in the way that he won't move an inch to compromise, but he'll leave behind some good foundations. The youth stuff is good because United need some sort of long term setup (in retrospect, given that we have Poch and one of the better youth systems in the country, there's no need for someone like LvG), but we really don't. He wouldn't have won immediately with us, and we are in dire need of feel good stuff after last season.

true,michal_m,eu,EU,"Isn't it possible to simply steal blank check from somebody's checkbook, fill it out, forge the signature and then cash it?

'Cause when I want to transfer money to someone else's account I need to sign in with my username and password (both of which only I know), fill out the money transfer form with recipient's IBAN account number, the amount and I can add a short note (e.g. what it's for) if I want and hit ""send"". Then, in a few seconds, I get a text message on my cell from the bank with a confirmation code that I need to enter on the webpage (as it asks me to do so). Alternatively, I could ask my bank to send me a bunch of throwaway scratchcard codes, but it's pointless if you have a cell phone.
The money is transferred within a few hours if I choose a standard transfer (which is free). I can also use a fast transfer which costs a few $ but delivers money in a few minutes.
Of course the recipient knows who this money came from, account number, sender's name and the note he attached to it.

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that the only way someone could steal money from my account was if that person somehow knew my login data (usrnm and pass) and at the same time stole my phone. Acquiring both those things is very unlikely.
With checks it's as simple as forging one with your routing and account number (which you basically hand out as it's printed on your checks).

In any case it's plainly obvious that the **overwhelming** majority of girls targeted are non-Muslim.

&gt;The fact you've said Pakistanis are a minority of Muslims in the UK only adds to the confusion in describing them as such.

A plurality of British Muslims are Pakistani- I don't think 40% counts as a minority because they're the single largest group of Muslims in the UK by country of origin.

The point of using the term Muslim as opposed to Pakistani highlights that it is because the victims aren't Muslims of any background that they are targeted.

She has no body anymore to regenerate.  If this wasn't enough, she gave up all of her remaining regenerations in ""Let's Kill Hitler"" in order to save the Doctor.

Your argument is that I can't say Agger declined because of injury and not say the same about Glenno.

true,mtempissmith,null,null,"We started out the new series with an older Doctor. People forget that. Eccleston wasn't quite as old as Capaldi is, but still he was a more mature Doctor. He still ended up kissing Rose, now didn't he? Yeah, he then morphed into Mr Sex Walking On Two Feet Tennant who incidentally was still a dozen years older than Billie Piper. When he finally left it was Matt Smith who then came along and he was younger than any of them, but that's not been the norm to date, a guy quite that young playing The Doctor and it was duly and jokingly noted several times on the show that his new face was a ""baby face"" and all. 

I honestly didn't expect the next Doctor after Smith to be as young. I rather figured they'd go older, but I didn't think they'd go quite as old as they did. I don't care though. It's not as though Capaldi is ugly. He's a mature man, yes, but he's not at all bad looking really I don't think. I don't think I could crush on him the way I admittedly did on Davison, on McGann, or  Tennant, but that's perfectly okay. I didn't crush on a lot of the Doctor's before and I didn't crush on Smith either. I enjoyed some of their tenures completely sans any crush actually and it was fine. 

I'm not saying having a young hottie in the Tardis wasn't fun, because it is, of course it is. It only adds to the fun when The Doctor qualifies as Bonafide Eye Candy, but it's not an imperative for me. I don't watch Doctor Who just to drool over the strange man in the blue box. If I can, well hurrah, but no matter what face he has he's still The Doctor to me and that's all that matters. Very, very rarely have I not liked the actor playing The Doctor at all. 

Only twice have I stopped watching the show or skipped over the rest of an actor's episodes because I honestly could not get into him as The Doctor. There have been Doctors I'm admittedly a bit lukewarm about. But only two made me turn off the TV, and actually the one, McCoy has grown on me a bit over time. I've come to like the actor a bit more and that helps. Colin Baker was the other one and I have nothing bad to say about him really. As a person he's actually very nice and I have seen him in other things and liked him just fine. I just really don't care for his Doctor that's all.

I can't completely judge Capaldi from one episode, of course not, but I can say that so far he's been fun and I am looking forward to seeing more. I'm sure most of the young girls will find him rather Dad like and that's okay. That's how it started after all, didn't it? With an older, grandfather like Doctor? So here we are, full circle.

It means that the dealer has cash with which to buy new stock, and that's tremendously useful in this business.

The problem is that thanks in no small part to television programs (over here at least) like Bargain Hunt, people automatically expect a discount on the ticket price ('what's your best price?'), and often refuse to buy an item unless they get one. This has led antiques dealers to inflate their prices by 10-20% so that they can accommodate such requests, which leads to potential buyers balking at ticket prices and asking for a discount. It's a vicious cycle and makes this a hard way to make a living.

So, if I price my items with a 10-20% mark-up and go down in price when people ask, I have an expensive shop that people are hesitant to shop in. If I price my items correctly and refuse to go down in price, people assume that I'm ripping them off and refuse to do business with me.

&gt;In any case it's plainly obvious that the overwhelming majority of girls targeted are non-Muslim.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/child-sex-grooming-the-asian-question-7729068.html

&gt;Most of the victims have been white, although in one case several Bangladeshi Muslim girls were also abused.

These girls have generally been from care homes and the demographic of girls in care homes in these areas are overwhelmingly white.

Since these cases have come to light however, charities have conducted reports and found similar cases of Pakistani gangs abusing girls in their own community, [this report](http://www.mwnuk.co.uk//go_files/resources/UnheardVoices.pdf) for example found significant evidence of Pakistani girls being abused by groups of Pakistani men. 

&gt;A plurality of British Muslims are Pakistani- I don't think 40% counts as a minority because they're the single largest group of Muslims in the UK by country of origin.
The point of using the term Muslim as opposed to Pakistani highlights that it is because the victims aren't Muslims of any background that they are targeted.
It's all very simple: Muslims obviously don't deem non-Muslims as their equals and so the perfect conditions for things like this to occur are created.

40% is a minority whether you like it or not. You can't disagree with maths, it's not a subjective thing. If it was a Muslim thing, why aren't the other 60% of Muslims doing it to the same extent? Why is it so heavily skewed by Pakistanis? It's like saying Kebabs is a Muslim thing rather than a Turkish thing. The rest of your post has been debunked anyway as it's come to light that there actually has been significant intra-community child abuse within the Pakistani community carried out by gangs of men against girls who are often of the same race and religion.

Honest question: of what relevance is Salmond's personal choice on this? We're not voting for a fascist dictatorship. If ""Plan B"" becomes necessary it will be determined democratically. 

&gt; It's pretty obvious 

It's not ""obvious"", it's explicitly set out in numerous documents, there is no doubt or uncertainty on this. He's handling it badly imho, his problem is that he doesn't want to admit that a currency union might not happen and this is being spun into not having a plan at all. 

&gt; When oil revenues drop....what will he do to plug the hole?

The question is do we want that to happen after 60 more years of investment in Scotland or after 60 years of it being spent on London infrastructure?

&gt; that's not a very attractive option to me because rates will be set by the United Kingdom with zero consideration of Scotland

So, literally identical to the status quo? The UK rates are set to keep London happy and this is the cause of many woes outside of London. The exchange rate changes of the 80s are a perfect example, London juiced the exchange rate to make the UK more foreign-investor friendly at the cost of the UK's manufacturing industry. The only programs to create new jobs were in London, for example the creation of Canary Wharf.

We'd like to have our own Canary Wharf type project by the time the money runs out. Personally I'd prefer to see it in hi-tech industries rather than banking, another benefit of cutting ties with the Eton crowd.

true,shortpaleugly,null,null,"&gt;Most of the victims have been white, although in one case **several** Bangladeshi Muslim girls were also abused.

You're clutching at straws.

&gt;Since these cases have come to light however, charities have conducted reports and found similar cases of Pakistani gangs abusing girls in their own community, this report for example found significant evidence of Pakistani girls being abused by groups of Pakistani men.

The sample size of that report was 35 victims of which **21** were of Pakistani Muslim heritage.

Again, **21**.

&gt;40% is a minority whether you like it or not. You can't disagree with maths, it's not a subjective thing.

That's laughable- 2 in 5 Muslims in the UK is of Pakistani origin and you're telling me not to argue with the maths?

&gt;If it was a Muslim thing, why aren't the other 60% of Muslims doing it to the same extent?

How do we know they're not? It's taken this long for such flagrant instances of organised paedophilia to finally come to light so there's no telling what's going on in the other Muslim communities.

&gt;The rest of your post has been debunked anyway as it's come to light that there actually has been significant intra-community child abuse within the Pakistani community carried out by gangs of men against girls who are often of the same race and religion. It's because of cultural reasons this has been brushed under the carpet.

Again- **35** victims made the basis of that report of which **21** were Pakistani.

You're telling me that my argument is debunked because 21 Pakistani girls who have been the victim of sexual abuse were the basis of that report?

I'm not sure why I keep having to explain this. When you are drunk there is a good chance you will do something you would not do sober, because drinking lowers you inhibitions. So you might happily consent to having sex with a person who if sober you would not consent to having sex with. And legally, it is very hard to tell the difference between that happening and a guy forcing himself on a women who has not consented if the women has drunk so much she can't remember anything that happened and it's her word against his.

&gt;Child A (2000)6 was 12 when the risk of sexual exploitation became known. She was associating with a group of older Asian men and possibly taking drugs. She disclosed having had intercourse with 5 adults. Two of the adults received police cautions after admitting to the Police that they had intercourse with Child A. Child A continued to go missing and was at high risk of sexual exploitation. A child protection case conference was held. It was agreed by all at the conference that Child A should be registered. However, the CID representative argued against the category of sexual abuse being used because he thought that Child A had been ‘100% consensual in every incident’. **This was overruled, with all others at the case conference demonstrating a clear understanding that this was a crime and a young child was not capable of consenting to the abuse she had suffered. She was supported appropriately once she was placed on the child protection register.**

The veto that Spain have explicitly said they won't do? 

The only person who has even suggested this was a Spaniard with no official responsibilities in those affairs saying so while he was sucking cock in a bid to become the head of NATO.

Nope, the Better Together campaign has spent the last two years saying that it's not a possibility at all. They genuinely dropped the ball there, the audience also agreed it was a ""revelation"", this is the first time any member of their campaign has conceded that the pound is safe. 

They just released a patronising video aimed at women today which continues on with this ""lose the pound"" theme.

I don't think you're going to find a solution for this other than mounting your phone. I believe some Garmins have the ability to play back music.

I use a RAM mount attached to one of my clipons, they're extremely modular and you end up buying the few parts needed to make use of the mount instead of one specific kit.

In the UK, the kit I got set me back 60 quid. It looks something like [this](http://i1.minus.com/iVgsWQ9gsyfG0.png), I had rubber bands attached that time as it was my first ride out with the phone attached and was unsure how stable it was.

If you do end up getting a RAM mount, and you have a 'phablet' like the Note 3 in the photo, get the phone mount instead of the tablet mount. The tablet mount lists the Note 3 as a supported device, but the Note will fit into the phone mount and it's so very very much tighter and more secure.

Your argument would be fine if it were not for the fact that it is only ever deployed when it suits people to do so. Any honest discussion of these issues must recognise that the recent elections were not just about the eventual outcome, but the huge increase in anti-EU establishment feeling amongst EU voters and genuine confusion (to the extent that there is still no agreement) about what the Lisbon Treaty actually meant by having the appointment of the Commission President ""take account of"" the parliamentary elections. *Spitzenkandidaten* was only ever one view, it may (for the moment) have won out but it was certainly not a settled position that a voter could confidently use to determine how to cast their vote.

While I agree that this is absolutely disgusting, I don't think this warrants a complete resignation of every councillor in the city cabinet. 

The council leader has taken responsibility and stepped down. The rest will get their reckoning at the next election. 

The council aren't the sole party responsible- the problem extends to the police service and general support services in the area as well. This is the kind of thing that warrants an externally-managed inquiry- not a by-election. 

&gt;Also, It shows just how contemptible and Ivory Tower-like the modern Labour party is at it's core.

I don't think this reflects upon the Labour party as a whole in quite the way you're attempting to imply. This seems to be a matter of utter, wilful negligence on the part of the local bureaucracy- and, again, something best dealt with by a comprehensive external inquiry. 

The primary concern ought to be figuring out what process breakdowns allowed this state of affairs to come about, and let these bastards get away with it for such an obscene length of time. A by-election won't do that.

&gt;Being a UKIP supporter is grounds for taking away their foster children,

The UKIP adoption case is still under investigation. Council officials have stated that it wasn't *just* the UKIP membership that was the deciding factor- which could either be a pathetic excuse to distract attention from the fact that it was the predominant reason, or something deeper's at issue. I'm inclined to wait for the facts of that matter to come out.

We don't know enough facts yet to see *how* this was allowed to happen, and how significant an influence council members' suggestions were. It sounds like it's a broader systemic problem than just councillors' (stupid, counterproductive, almost criminally negligent) incompetence.

However: 

&gt;Wouldn't want to appear racist now! Punish those nasty UKIPers and reward the Asians who tick the diversity box.

Unfortunately not all that far from the mentality they appear to have shown. 

I'm not particularly desperate to start howling for their blood until more facts come out, as I expect shall be the case in the next couple of days- but it sounds like they've fouled up in every way it's possible to do so. 

""Community cohesion"" is an important thing to bear in mind when drafting policy- but *not to the point where it entails not doing your job*. It sounds like they might have erred much too far on the side of caution here- and given that the estimate of 1,400 is ""conservative"", God only knows how many kids suffered because of it. 

Again- this warrants an investigation headed up by people outside the council/local organisations' control. If things are as bad as they look, I wouldn't be surprised if it led to certain individuals' being thrown behind bars.

true,nssmuckers,num5-away,,"I didn't say Song was a box-to-box midfielder, and I could take your point a bit easier if you didn't include Dembele. I do think Mousa is a box-to-box midfielder but he's nothing like the players you listed in that he doesn't produce anything in the final third. He doesn't get into the box to score goals, he doesn't create goals. He wins the ball back and drives it forward from midfield. Paulinho would be a better example of your definition.

I don't know that there's an official rulebook on which players are considered which role, particularly in central midfield where the lines are increasingly blurring as all-arounders become more prominent. There are very few players like Sergio Busquets or, say, Pirlo anymore. Instead you have players like Javi Martinez who can play as an anchor but can also cover tons of ground and pass really well. 

Pochettino certainly didn't employ goalscoring central midfielders at Southampton, but both players were certainly expected to take turns bombing forward to link midfield and attack. If you watched Schneiderlin at all last season I guess I'm not sure how you could classify him as anything else. 

I guess I just have a looser definition of what makes a player box-to-box. I think when you start bringing vagueness like ""good skill around both boxes"" into play, it can get pretty messy. 

I consider a central midfielder who is expected to cover a lot of ground in both attack and defense to be a box-to-box midfielder. The way we are employing Capoue right now is what I would consider a defensive midfielder, as he is rarely joining attacks at all and is usually dropping between the center halves to pick up the ball.

&gt; Odd image to highlight, Gerrard is fine positionally relative to the other midfielders

I completely disagree - he's offering nothing with his position there. Henderson and Allen are both close enough to players to be right on top of them if they receive the ball (without being so close to get done if the make a run). The defence are pretty much where they should be picking up players. But Gerrard isn't stopping any passes by standing in that space, or even making them more difficult. 

He either has to be closing down the player on the ball, or has to be deep enough that he's helping the defence. Where he is in that image, he's not close enough to the player with the ball to force them to hurry a pass or limit their options, and he's not far enough away to be covering any of the other players. Pretty much the only thing he's offering there is the ability to intercept a pass that's mis-placed straight to him, or stopping the player on the ball from running further than the several yards of space they've already got. He's in complete no-mans land and any ball hit with pace or lobbed to any other Man City player is going to go straight past him.

I will admit though that I don't think still images alone offer perfect criticism, because there's no context to what happened just before that or where players are running. But as that image is and for whatever reason he's stood there, Gerrard isn't in a helpful position to the team.",0,1409095761,null,0,1409095948,0,ck1dapi,t3_2eo0xt,t1_ck1dapi,t1_ck1bx1h,null,1427343545,5,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,5

&gt;When you are drunk there is a good chance you will do something you would not do sober, because drinking lowers you inhibitions. So you might happily consent to having sex with a person who if sober you would not consent to having sex with.

Why are you presenting this single narrative as if it's somehow representative of most cases? You know when you have been raped, it's not something you accidentally do, what you're saying is border-lining a very common stereotype of rape victims as just being drunken sluts who just regretted their decision in the morning, i'm sure that's not what you meant but that way of thinking is very dangerous.

The question isn't about potential harm, we already know lots of things that harm us that we are in contact with that we accept. It's about the risk of the harm vs the benefit the things give us. We accept the health risks of air pollution because we want cars. &gt; 2 million deaths in 2012 (http://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/blog/the-worlds-fastest-growing-cause-of-death-is-car-exhaust) for example.

Since the risk of e-cigs is low - overall unknown, but generally thought of as non-existent to low - and the risk of smoking tobacco products is high - 100000 deaths a year in the UK alone - then the utilitarian benefits of vaping across society is without question. 

People talk about this sort of stuff without any basic understanding of the science around it. It's insane. We know the chemicals produced through vaping. We know they are used in lots of other applications throughout society. We know that the levels of nicotine inhaled is harmless (although addictive). We know the amount of nicotine produced through the exhale is hardly detectable. We know how many people die from smoking, either first hand or passively. If this recommendation stops only 10% of vapers from using e-cigs and turns them back onto fags that means that if there are 2 million vapers, 10% of which go back to fags, that's 200000 smokers more than there should be - half of which we know will die from the habit over the course of their life. 

Absolutely insane.

Anything that stops people consuming tobacco products and shows such a low level of risk as vaping does is a total no-brainer and for WHO come come out with this crap is shameful.

&gt; ...how about tell people not to rape?

We (as a society) have been telling people not to rape for a long time, if it was that simple then we wouldn't be having this conversation. 

&gt; Why are you presenting this single narrative as if it's somehow representative of most cases? You know when you have been raped, it's not something you accidentally do, what you're saying is border-lining a very common stereotype of rape victims as just being drunken sluts who just regretted their decision in the morning, i'm sure that's not what you meant but that way of thinking is very dangerous.

You knowing something isn't enough to get a conviction. You have to convince a jury that you were actually raped which is much harder if you were drunk at the time.

The success of academy is measured by both of those, and for years we have struggles but now we have multiple players on loan and some sold to first and second tier clubs. This will only increase the reputation of our academy and hopefully get players like Raheem, Suso and Ibe to come from other academies at young age.

Rafa set up the academy well, but I think it's Rodgers and recently Ingletorp who are really pushing for them to get playing time.

If they make you sign-up for Universal Jobmatch there is a checkbox which allows them to see exactly what you've been doing on there, you DO NOT have to tick that.

Despite the fact that almost all of the abusers were Asian?

Almost all the abusers were also male, is that information meaningless in an investigation?

Almost all of the abusers lived in the local area, is that information useless?

true,thestormcooper,null,null,"They are generally nice, just trying to get a lot of people in work and are probably overwhelmed with people. As long as you record everything you do during your job searches on UNIVERSAL JOBMATCH as this is their proof that you are actually looking for a job, you should be OK. (They will give you log in details at some point). When you get your adviser, who you usually see once a month (ish), they can sometimes be harsh, mine made me feel like shit every time i saw him, but they are not all like that.

Thats about it really, so here's some other things you may want to explore in helping you to look for a job! (wall of text, sorry! important parts in capitals!)

I would use the NATIONAL CAREERS SERVICE, they usually have people in the job centre from there but you only get 3 appointments with them. The website is free and they have online chat too which can be helpful too.

You can sign up to their [WEBSITE](https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/Pages/Home.aspx), and do a [SKILLS HEALTH CHECKER](https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/tools/skillshealthcheck/Pages/default.aspx), there is lots of questions to answer and it might take you a while but it gives you a basic overview of what skills you think you are good at and which  fields of work you are better suited to. Also they have [JOB PROFILES](https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobfamily/Pages/default.aspxv) which you can browse through, its especially useful for you because you have a degree, as you can find different jobs in your field that you may not have even considered but use the same skills.

Use [LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/) if you don't already, it has a lot of jobs on there, Its also especially helpful in networking with other people with similar interests, e.g. same degrees, to help to find work in quite specific sectors. I have added people like my university tutors and other people who have the same of similar degree to me, you might not get many but its always helpful for advice  for jobs in certain fields.

Also If you find a job and it tells you the company, go to the companies website and see if you can apply directly. Less people would think of doing that. If you can also find a phone number of the company you find a job for, RING THEM as [1] The Job might be gone [2] You can speak to someone directly and build up a rapport with them and [3] It shows them you are really interested. But generally most places, especially large companies will just tell you to go online. 

I would definitely use AGENCIES, even if you just place your CV on their website, and if you can find agencies that are specific to your degree then that's a bonus too.

i live about half the year in the uk and half in california.  i hold dual citizenship.  i see myself as sort of an outsider and insider in both places. 
one thing i am often amazed by is the somewhat casual attitude taken to child sexual abuse in the uk.  i once lived in a very small cathedral city and there were all sorts of snickers about the boys' choir.  snickers, not upset.  not anger.  not disgust.  snickers.  like it was just one of those things.  one of the deacons at this cathedral was known to take off for thailand on his vacation for the opportunity that country affords for underage sex.  it was kind of an open secret.  more snickers.     a horrible man repairing my car once told me of a fourteen, fifteen  year old girl who 'really wanted it' so that weekend he obliged, and he had no problem sharing this with me.

in any of these cases in america, i would have called the police; anyone would have.  and the police would have switched into overdrive on it.  in fact i would have been legally obliged to report it.  

how could jimmy saville have gotten away with it?  esp. all that business with the hospitals.

i once heard  christopher hitchens tell a joke to an american audience about sex with choir boys  and there was horrified silence and some gasps.  really pointed up the difference to me somehow.

I think our best performance last year was against Spurs at WHL with a midfield of Lucas, Henderson, and Allen. We also played really well against City with that same midfield, ultimately we lost 2-1 but we did well to control the pace of the game and were still strong offensively and only conceded off a corner and what was somewhat of a long ball followed by a mistake by Mignolet. It was certainly better than last night's performance with a similar squad (Lovren in for Sakho, Moreno for Cissokho, Lucas for Gerrard, Suarez for Sturridge).

I also wonder how Can would do in that position, as I've not seen him play near enough to say where he'd be best suited. Seems to have good feet and is relatively quick, so he looks like he could do well in CM as well. Also adaptable to different formations, where as Lucas and Gerrard aren't quite as malleable.

You can wear a Western suit with a tie (with or without a blazer/waistcoat) or an [Indo-western suit](http://images.grabmore.com/ProductImages_M7/Azaa_3365_L1.jpg) (don't buy shirt-collared blazers - they're tacky in my opinion). My advice is go for full traditional. No pre-stitched, no fashion fusions and no western improvisations (which could make the elder aunties feel uncomfortable). How often are you going to wear proper luxe Indian clothes? Make the most of this opportunity! I suggest shopping around in areas with a big South Asian population (best place for a string of shops in London is Southall Broadway, but Whitechapel, Wembley and Green Street each have one to offer too). A decent but affordable outfit costs between £40-£120 (minus accessories). Note that sherwanis are more expensive than kurta pajama/salwar kameez (both usually comes with a scarf/dupatta as part of a three piece set), but I'd opt for a slightly less embellished [jodhpuri](http://www.touch18.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Jodhpuri.jpg) - they're more wearable to other events. If you want to look ridiculously dapper, you could risk wearing [jodhpurs](http://wedmegood.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/nehru-jacket-with-jodhpurs1.jpg) with your jodhpuri, or buy a jodhpuri that comes with a cravat. Other bottoms you could opt for are churidar or dhoti (not to be confused with lungi which is casual clothing), but I wouldn't recommend them as they can be fussy, and instead wear the trouser-like pajama that comes with most tops. You might be given a plain pagri to wear on the day, but don't bother buying one - the groom might prefer to be the only one to wear it. For shoes, wear black western leather shoes, like brogues, or khussas (aka. mojari or jooti). You can wear one of those [Nehru jackets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yt_Uy0hrXGw) for the civil registry, but I don't know if that would be too casual though. Swords and daggers are strictly for the groom.

For the female guest, she may need to get her blouse/choli tailored, but the saree is one size fits all (sold in various lengths) and needs little to no alterations. Petticoats usually don't come with the two piece set, so she'll need to buy one (I prefer a non-flared petticoat, so the saree doesn't end up looking like a skirt. It's not the most comfortable thing to wear, so I suggest fitting a tough elastic band or ribbon to replace the rossi/lace. 

I highly suggest that she's wears a matching set of [churi/bangles](http://style.pk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/eid-churiyan-collection.jpg) and earrings/jhumka if her hair is tied up. Mehndi/henna, haar mala/necklaces, maang tikka, jhumar, panja, payal/anklets, hair paranda, and bindis are things to consider wearing to complete the outfit (not altogether, of course). There are other accessories such as banjuband/armlet, kamarband/belt, challa/keyring, matha patti, hair rakodi juda, gajra/hair jasmine, mukut/tiara, hair chotli, rings/anguthi and naths/nose ring but they could look too bridal if they're very elaborate, and accessories like kalira, sindoor/vermillion and choora bangles are strictly for the bride, while mangalsutras are worn by married women (like a wedding ring). Decent but affordable costume jewellery sets cost £30+. Beware that you might be charged per limb, particularly for bangles and mehndi, but the cool thing about small South Asian/Desi businesses is that negotiating prices is a possibility.

Absolutely avoid wearing all red, gold (bridal colours), all white (funeral colour), all black and maybe pink if that's the colour the bride chooses to wear. I recommend watching Indian drama serials, such as on [Star Plus](https://www.youtube.com/user/starplus), to see what's on trend since some of the actors are also catalogue models. Practice how to neatly drape a saree (I prefer a long pallu hanging off my shoulder) in the [*standard style*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxyyplADV5o) (some people call it the [""nivi"" style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari#Styles_of_draping), I don't know why) - you can put the pallu/end at the front (or the dupatta across the body if wearing a lehnga) for the [gujarati style](http://photos.boldsky.com/ph-big/2013/07/fashionable-saree-draping-styles-to-try_13745620634.jpg) to show off the pallu design. If it's raining or you're entering a religious place, you can pull the pallu up to cover your head and down over your arms. There are countless (regional) ways to drape a saree. Use pins to secure the pleats, fall and pallu in place - you can attach the saree to the blouse using a decorative brooch/clip if you want. I really dislike fitted/half sarees - they're kind of childish and are basically just lenghas with a dupatta attached to it. If you want something easier to wear, try a [butterfly saree](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pbxpJ3gNu6o/T36pDKj4qnI/AAAAAAAABJQ/6HJIBQgqj9M/s1600/weddinginspirasi.jpg). I personally prefer glass tissue/net/chiffon sarees or any saree with raised sequins/cutdana/zardozi/diamante/gota patti patterns for North Indian weddings, and silk brocade Banarasi sarees or sarees with a flat zari/resham embroidery for South Indian weddings. There are so many [types, decorations and fabrics](http://www.utsavfashion.com) you can choose from. My least favourite materials are non-slinky crêpe/bedsheet-like material and large net curtain-like lace. 

Blouse-wise, I prefer wide-neck *back* opening blouses, not front opening (wearing a front opening blouse with a transparent saree is a fashion faux-pas in my opinion). I also prefer the blouse to match the border, rather than the middle part of the saree or mismatching. I currently really like long sheer sleeves, capped sleeves, thick straps, and those [open-back ornamental chains](http://sareeblousefashion.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Backless_Saree-Blouse.jpg). If you don't want to wear a saree, then you could wear something else - I prefer the [anarkali dress](http://thedelhibride.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/baby-pink-anarkali-satin-tulle-jyotsna-tiwari-india-bridal-fashion-week-2014.jpg?w=810), but there's also punjabi patiala or pishwa (types of salwar kameez), gharara, sharara, lehnga, ghagra, and [women's versions of men's attire](http://i00.i.aliimg.com/photo/v0/138677282/dhoti_salwar_suit.jpg). As for shoes, wear open-toed glitzy heels, or [khussa](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FEKuDvwLYdk/UjInzoek-tI/AAAAAAAAPMU/Upryw2489FA/s1600/HZ-Khussa-Collection-20.jpg) or chappals for comfort. Don't forget a fancy handbag too. For the civil ceremony, I would consider wearing a more plain Indian garment, but make it [look more formal](http://datastore05.rediff.com/h1500-w1500/thumb/52605E5F6D6C65665C60665C696C7371/tzp2ngg3fmg7eekt.D.0.sonam-kapoor-photos.JPG) through accessorising and makeup/hairstyle if you don't want to wear a western dress/suit. Avoid all white as most brides wear that colour for civil registries. Children wear western dresses or mini versions of adult garments.

When you're invited to pre/post-wedding events; sagai, mehndi ceremony, haldi ceremony, sangeet, nikah, etc, let me know if you need advice.

 I'm of the belief that if you want a big club, if you want quality players who demand high fee's, high salary's, if you want the big names then you have to accept things like LED advertisements that aim to Maximize revenue.

 If we didn't have those LED billboards for ads where do you think the money would come from? The ticket holders, ticket prices will go up to to accommodate the exorbitant prices of players these days. Now of course in our scenario Mansour would probably take the hit or be very reluctant to pass that on onto fans but the vision has always been to make city self sustaining, and that means maximising revenue where ever possible so we can do more than simply break even, so we eventually wont need a sheikh to be financing our operations.

Now you might ask, ""well look at old trafford they dont have LED ads on their second teir"" well its because united have had decades and decades to build up their fanbase and brand prestige that they dont have to do that, whereas our rise has been so quick (6-7 years is really bugger all) that we haven't built up a big enough fan base and built up enough brand prestige-though we are getting there- to not have to consider these billboards.

&gt; But in Sherlock she clearly states that she is gay. Then a single man comes along and changes that. That's not writing with an open outlook of bisexuality, that's a female character literally being changed and proven wrong about her sexuality by a single male character.

This part is really flawed, because you assume that a label that someone places upon themselves is 100% accurate with no room for fault. Sexuality is a very fluid thing, and not everyone bothers or wants to bother to define themselves accurately.

&gt; In the original Sherlock Holmes story

Oh, yes, bravo. The original Sherlock Holmes stories weren't sexist at all and should be the standard for any future comparison! Arthur Conan Doyle was the most progressive upper class white male in the 19th century there ever was! */s*

&gt; Moffat had no reason to change these fundamental aspects of her character from a 100 year old story, which is why I conclude that Moffat is sexist as fuck.

Not every change when writing an adaptation is explained by that chip on your fucking shoulder. First of all, the changes Moffat made are by no means ""fundamental"" changes to her character. Speaking as a feminist, the female-character-who-is-badass-and-cant-hurt-by-nothing archetype is stupid and overdone by REAL misogynists who want to seem socially forward, or, as is likely Doyle's and other extreme misogynists' cases, overdone as a really ""out-there"" women-could-never-be-this-smart plot idea (Case in point: Adler's described in the original story as having the intelligence of a man). Moffat maintained the fundamental character, but added the changes to showcase emotion and fragility, like *ANY OTHER MALE REALISTIC CHARACTER IN WELL DONE MODERN DRAMA WOULD HAVE*, for example, John's reaction to Sherlock coming back in the prose vs. the TV show. Her dependency on powerful male characters is a trait that is carried forward from the original work, and is done in a way more progressive way by Moffat. Might I add that the ""dependency"" that you perceive in the TV show isn't actually due to her being a female, but because she falls in love, which is an entirely gender-neutral phenomenon.

Khedira is much closer to being a box-to-box midfielder. He makes runs into the opposition box, covers a ton of ground, and even takes players on from time to time. He is a dynamic player with an incredible work rate who can do a lot of things very well. 

Busquets is the purest anchor that exists in football today. He does not make forward runs unless the team is in desperate need of a goal, he does not take players on or overlap if an opportunity provides itself, he rarely even shoots. He does not cover a ton of ground, he doesn't sprint a lot, and he lets the ball do the work for him. 

You correctly mentioned that neither of them score many goals but Khedira has one more league goal than Busquets having played 90 matches less. 

These videos should suffice. You simply wouldn't find Busquets in some of the positions Khedira takes up in a million years.

I can't agree though, at all.

It's not necessary to be a top side, I went to the Nou Camp when we played Barca in March, I can honestly say, that despite the grand scale of the stadium and the awe it could inspire, it was decrepit and basic.

Are Barca not a top club?

We don't need all the bells and whistles. It's just corporate garbage which cheapens the character of the sport.

The LED second tier advertising hoardings are wholly unnecessary. They're gratuitous and detract from the actual purpose of being there - to watch the football on the pitch in front of you.

And, in my opinion, they look utterly hideous. They're distracting and they're an eyesore.

There's no foundation whatsoever for your argument that they're imperative to being a top club. With all due respect mate, that notion is nonsense.

I don't even agree that they're necessary for advertisements. We already have pitch side LED advertising.

It's just an example of the Americanisation we're undergoing. I think the intentions are to show off in all honesty, it's less about necessity and more about bells and whistles.

For some reason there'll probably have been a suit in the boardroom who had a look at such advertisements in the NFL etc, and thought: ""that's great, let's be the first to introduce it in the Premier League"".

Maybe the intentions were good, about innovation and the like, but I genuinely find them hideous, and I don't think they're suited to football.

They're about as suited to our national sport as cheerleaders and fireworks

true,TheLimeyLemmon,null,null,"Hello there! Former jobseeker who's been employed since April I'll be frank with my experience as possible and hopefully give you some pointers.

I was 23 when I first signed on last year. I'd finished uni, wasn't finding work in my field, and had no experience in any other sector. Being 23 I was dealt with in a separate office within the job centre, dealing solely with people between 18 - 24. While it's my only experience, it does seem that the staff are a little more friendly, guiding and understanding.. to an extent. They get all sorts, good and bad, so they typically walk you through everything, but given you've just come out of university they might treat you with a bit more of a readiness since they know your goals.

Now I was on jobseeker's for six months and I think if I knew what I know now, I could have been on it for far shorter a time, so here are my tips:



- When job searching, try looking for email or quick submission applications first, ones which may only require you to upload your cv and a cover letter. Keep multi-page online application forms as a last resort. I put hours into applications like that, only to receive rejection emails MONTHS later. They're not worth the trouble.

- If you need to find extra jobs for your booklet each week, Indeed is the best source. Once you have a CV ready you can upload it to the site and apply for jobs with just a click.

- Keep a record of your applications in case Jobcentre plus need to see them. I typically just kept my confirmation emails in a separate folder on gmail and showed it to them when signing on.

- Dress smart! For six months I walked into the jobcentre in whatever I could throw on first. Looked tired, felt tired, and came off as someone just there for the JSA. Then one day I sharpened myself up, just to give it a shot, and it did a lot for my confidence and attitude when asking about opportunities.

- Press Job Centre Plus for any opportunities they might have coming up. Work trials regularly come up, and because of your age you're actually eligible for work experience trials up until the age of 24. These typically last between 2-6 weeks, and between 16-30 hours per week. That might sound intimidating and extreme, it might even be against your ethics, but you'll still be paid JSA, you might only need to phone the jobcentre on days when you're supposed to sign on, you can claim travel and uniform costs, you may not require a reference even and you will have work experience to put on your CV day one. It's ridiculous how many more job interview offers I started getting once I put the experience down.

Gosh I think that's everything! Don't sweat it too much, and be forward, and you won't be on jobseekers for long. Good luck!",0,1409103482,null,0,false,0,ck1guh3,t3_2emxls,t1_ck1guh3,t3_2emxls,null,1427341890,3,false,UKJobs,t5_2seb3,3

Vast ticket price increases, corporatisation and Americanisation. It's endemic in the league as a whole.

But we're undergoing the most rapid transformation. Our most expensive season ticket will be £1250 next season (City have released figures as a forewarning to people in these areas of the stadium), not so long ago it was circa £600. The Americanisation I've highlighted previously is now ubiquitous at the club. 

Sure we have a hugely successful side, but the analogy I'd make is being offered a dream job, but in order to get it you'd have to change your name, divorce the woman you love and erase everything you stood for.

I've touched on this before, and it's a long topic, but this is my biggest gripe with City at present and is a cause of major disillusionment for myself, and others, with the club.

The balls been rolling so long now, that the only thing that could possibly turn the tide away from the absolute irreversible sanitisation of the Premier League is safe standing and cheap tickets.

true,Findiglay,null,null,"&gt; It's pretty obvious that the backup option would be to keep on using the pound with interest rates set by the Bank of England, but that's not a very attractive option to me because rates will be set by the United Kingdom with zero consideration of Scotland.

Do you think they give much consideration to Scotland at present? Joseph Sitgletz has pointed out that for Scotland to continue to use the pound without an agreement in place would not change much. Scotland does not have any direct say in BoE policy at present and it is natural that they will first consider the more populated places of the UK like London. It is very unlikely that the BoE would ever set monetary policy in the interests of Scotland solely (5 Million out of 63 Million). So at present, if its good for rUK then it better also be good for Scotland, because interest rates are never going to be set with only Scotland in mind. 

But its quite obvious the Pound would only be used for a transitional period as it was used in Ireland. Without a currency union we would most likely issue our own currency when the time is right on the model of the Danish Kroner (but perhaps pegging to the Pound rather than the Euro).

&gt; When oil revenues drop (and I say when, because one day they will) and Scotland's over-exposed economy suffers a massive shortfall in funding, what will he do to plug the hole? Will he borrow the money and gamble with my future or will be whack up income taxes up to a basic rate of 30%, to say nothing of any other rates or personal allowances?

Oil reserves will extend until 2055 at least. We might discover more, and as technology improves and prices rise more barrels will become recoverable. But for now we know at least there is 30+ years worth left (around half the total value of North Sea Oil). But this is a problem, you are correct. Current 200,000 people in Scotland are employed in the oil industry. That is a huge amount for our small country and we need to do something about it before its too late i.e. we need to gradually re-engineer our economy towards traditional manufacturing &amp; new technology industries, or else in 30+ years time that's a large % of our workforce going out of work. This is why its so important we have full control over domestic &amp; foreign policy, to attract investment and prepare for the future.

&gt; if there is a drop in oil revenues.

If there is a drop in oil revenues then unfortunately we will drop down a few places in the league of the world's richest nations, but we will remain a relatively rich nation even without any oil. Any nation needs sensible government with good fiscal policy and every nation has somewhat volatile tax recipes each year.  But seeing that we had a record level of investment in the North Sea in 2014 since drilling began in the 70s, and that demand for oil is rising, it does not look like production or revenue will fall off any time soon (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/10565072/Investment-in-North-Sea-oil-and-gas-to-rise-sharply-say-analysts.html).

This is from a recent report by the UK Goverment on Oil &amp; Gas which was published under the names of Vince Cable and Michael Moore (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/175480/bis-13-748-uk-oil-and-gas-industrial-strategy.pdf):

 &gt; the UK supply chain, which recorded revenues of over £27 billion in 20113, has the potential to contribute significantly to the growth of the UK economy in the coming decades.

Page 25
&gt; According to Oil &amp; Gas UK’s Activity Survey, the reality is that the UK will continue to supply oil and gas well beyond 2055. On the long term demand side, even if the International Agency’s “New Policies Scenario” is met, global demand for oil and gas is forecast to increase by 28% between now and 2035

Lucas allows us to play almost the entire game at the same pace and makes it so we don't rely on the back four as heavily, whereas Gerrard doesn't. He's great for getting the attack going right away as he can pick a pass better than anyone else in the league, but he himself rarely joins the attack, so Lucas again isn't much of a loss there (though still weaker). As for set pieces, Stevie is incredible, but we do still have players that can take corners (Coutinho, Lallana, Markovic apparently), don't know about free kicks though.

*He already did*. He just doesn't remember it, due to having crossed his own time stream.

*Day of the Doctor* is central to this. In DotD, Eleven was ""the man who forgets"". By the end of the episode his sense of self and purpose is renewed, between the remembrance of the promise of being the Doctor, acknowledgement that no matter how bleak the situation he *can* find a way to do the right thing (even if he fails at it), and hope of finding and restoring Gallifrey.

Just like the Half-Face Man, Eleven (and by extension, Twelve) is looking for the promised land -- in the case of the Half-Face Man, some notion of Heaven; in the case of the Doctor, Gallifrey -- ""the long way round"". Notice that little blurb came up again?

*Time of the Doctor* is equally important. Eleven said ""I will always remember when the Doctor was me""...but always remember rule one. The Doctor has already been through more than enough of these silly regenerations to know his memory gets well-mussed in the process, but is at least telling Clara a half-truth.

Twelve may forget most or even all of what happened in his previous regeneration, but he still has the face of the man who Ten went back to save in the face of a fixed point in time (that is to say, he succeeded doing the right thing). The same Doctor whose tenure saw the final piece of the puzzle: *The Waters of Mars*.

Go back and watch the ""Time Lord Victorious"" monologue and compare it to Twelve's speech to the Half-Face Man about ""the view"". They're practically mirrors of one another, and that moment was when Ten, in his hubris, succeeded doing the *wrong* thing in the face of a fixed point in time, to horrible cost (I say wrong, because while he saved lives, he did the deed not for its own sake but as a monument to his own power and ego).

I think what Caecilius' face stands for, is Eleven making good on his last words to Clara, in his own way, to the best of his ability. It's the sum of his experiences -- it's always better to do the right thing, even if you fail, than to do the wrong thing even if you succeed; never forget the promise of being the Doctor; sometimes, the long way around is just the way you have to go; and that great *and* good things are possible (even in the face of something as immutable as a fixed point in time) if you look hard enough, and for that it is possible to wield the power and responsibility of a Time Lord while remaining a fundamentally good person.

Twelve is just going to have to remember that, and it looks like he'll be going the long way round.

true,notwherebutwhen,null,null,"In his heyday I think Alec Guinness (1950s-60s) could have pulled off a great Doctor. He would be slightly nervous but generally steely and world weary. He would excel at the Bavarian Fire Drill by pretending to be other people and disguising himself. This skill however would tend to keep his own companions at arms length. He would have the propensity to stumble into things but would generally be able to strike up a plan on the fly. He would normally wear an all white suit (hint hint).
Perfect foil as the Master: James Mason (partially lifting his character from North by Northwest).

Bill Nighy from the late 90s/early 00s (predating his role on Doctor Who) would have made a great Doctor. He would be kind of absent-minded but capable of moments of extreme focus and clarity usually in moments of peril and usually correlated with a sour and angry disposition. This would call into question if his absent-mindedness is a true trait or an affectation to appear less threatening. He would wear a nice button down shirt but with no tie and a classy suit coat (which would occasionally be in a brighter color). 
Perfect foil as the Master: Ian Richardson (pulling out some smarm and chessmastering from his role as Francis Urqhart)

Paddy Considine could make a great Doctor today. He would be surrounded by shades of darkness like the late days of the Eighth Doctor but he would always seek to have some fun good times. He would be at times really caring/empathetic and others completely oblivious to other's plights. He would end up surrounding himself with companions who turn out not to be the best equipped for adventuring causing him some grief and forcing him to reevaluate. He would wear a Milford coat like Sherlock wears in the most recent series but a little tighter. Perfect foil as the Master: Colin Firth (played like a cross between the Dream Lord and the Valeyard so actually maybe he would portray the Valeyard instead of the Master).

Other potential Doctors: Damian Lewis (finally ginger), Kenneth Branagh (older and commanding yet loves a good joke), Albert Finney (back in the day as a dashing young hero)

Other potential Masters: Gary Oldman (duh), Jeremy Irons (double duh), Jude Law (this guy does a real good menace), Paul Bettany (I mean have you seen the guy)

Look, we're not fighting the Nazis anymore, and GCHQ is no longer driving homosexuals to their death (I hope). The question is what are GCHQ mathematicians doing now, and why is it worthwhile? We all know some of the bad stuff they're doing - they're still collecting footage of millions of peoples sex lives just in case it's useful for blackmail later.

Personally I'd be looking for a lodger and I'd never let anyone in without 2 viewing (been burnt badly a few times).

My suggestion would be to email first and explain your situation and if you can provide UK references. Say in advance you can pay up front and then ask for a Skype or phone call (less chance call is ignored then).

If looking for private landlords then try places like www.gumtree.co.uk (our version of Craigslist - we do have Craigslist but it is full of scammers), www.spareroom.co.uk, www.houseshare.co.uk

Their team is massively unbalanced, with a scary as fuck attack and a mid-table defence. We're a little more balanced, so I think he probably would've done better with us than United. But he's Van Gaal and when a manager like that comes along, you fucking take him. I love Poch, but I would rather have a manager that has won everything there is to win (in terms of club football).",0,1409119621,null,0,false,0,ck1nd3u,t3_2enu48,t1_ck1nd3u,t1_ck192iu,null,1427338749,2,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,2

I used to volunteer at a charity that stored food for people in dire straits (it wasn't a food bank in itself - it just had this food kept aside for people who really needed it).

If I had to take food from there it certainly wouldn't be the sort of food I was accustomed to. You can forget about bread, fresh vegetables and meat.

If you do something harmful to someone, get an inquisitive lawyer who will drag things out and search for small details to exploit a loophole. 

For this type of issue get a 'del boy no-win-no-fee' lawyer. He will look at your case and give you a yes or no in minutes. Due to the volume of work he gets he will want to pump it out asap, and there will be no messing around. 

On the face of it, he/she might seem more expensive, but compared to 'normal' lawyers, his/her fee is fixed, not rolling and the incentive is to get you approved as fast as possible.

I had a friend from Malaysia who has spent most of her life here, more than qualified, but chose a shit lawyer, and ended up having to return 'home' as they messed up. She does have the right to come back and appeal in six months (sounds like you), but I think she is just going to stay there now. 

If she did appeal, youd bet that her lawyer would be racking up the fees.

We got a good del boy lawyer who took care of everything. After proving our papers, proof of co-residency, finances, I estimate that the process too hours in total, with zero stress. 

We were in the Home office for roughly 20 mins, while an employee of the lawyer finished our application.

How can you say that Mourinho didn't rate him well since he didn't even get a chance to play in the preseason game? He literally got transferred the day he came back from Brazil. Mourinho would have definitely given him a fair shot if he outperformed the other strikers in preseason. Plus, a huge reason why Courtois is starting is not just because he was patient, unlike Lukaku who's always been the first to avoid competition, but because of his contract situation. 

Courtois is a proven top 5 keeper already and if he didn't get playing time, we would have lost him. Lukaku has done fantastic on his loan spells but he still is nowhere near proven like Courtois is. It's not all his fault since he didn't get loaned to a big club, but Lukaku is all potential. Lukaku could go on to become one of the best strikers in the world, but Courtois is already a top 5 keeper and he could potentially be our goalkeeper for the next decade. There will probably be a dozen more Lukaku-potential forwards that will appear in the next decade.

Plus, how the fuck does Lukaku have a backbone? I actually support Lukaku's wishes if he wants to be the clear cut number one striker at an upcoming middle table PL club (aka the big fish in the small pond, but saying he has a backbone is stupid. He came here saying this was his ""boyhood club"" but has never shown that he wants to fight for his spot. If he had a backbone, he wouldn't have been a little bitch and been willing to stay (instead of running away from competition by requesting a loan) to beat out strikers, since that shows he's actually confident in his ability. Him requesting a loan after 4 games last year (in which he made 3 sub appearances and wasn't that great) because he felt he couldn't beat out fucking Torres, an old Eto'o and an old Ba (I love him though) is not having a backbone. Give me a break. Deciding to be the big player at a smaller club isn't him ""settling for second fiddle"" and being brave, it's him taking the easy way out. It's the best choice for his career, but it's not having a backbone.

Lukaku never even swallowed his huge ego for a bit and actually see if he would get a shot. It's one thing if he stayed last season and played as much as Demba Ba did last year. Okay, I see your point then. But him requesting a loan after 3 subs in 4 possible games is nowhere near enough evidence to say he was another young prospect who never got a chance.

All I have seen around here lately is ""lol hope Lukaku sux ths season guys hahaha"". That isn't worth respecting and I will definitely call people bitches for posting shit like that. Not only does it add zero usefull discussion to this thread, it has nothing to even do with Chelsea anymore. 

People who hate on players for no logical reasons are what I consider whiney bitches. Throughout this entire sub all you see are people taking digs at Lukaku at every chance they get.  

Lukaku came to Chelsea 3 years ago and like you said said that it was his boyhood club. But what you seem to have completely ignore is how he spent the remainder of that year.  He was completely wasted and practically had his career stalled. AVB fucked him over pretty hard and even told him to play as a winger in training instead of striker. You seem to think an entire season of mismanagement is water under the bridge, it isn't. It's something that definitely sticks with you and changes how you feel.

He tried to get past that with a loan the next season,  did very well.  Went on in the next season to join us for preseason,  looked very sharp, scored goals and looked ready to be the first choice for us. But then Torres, Ba and Eto'o all got picked over him in the matches at the start of the season.  Goes out on loan again so he can get more consistent game time, does very well again and is ready to come back.  Chelsea then purchase Costa, who is p f course one of the best strikers in the world, and things already look very limited for Lukaku. Then we bring back Drogba and that was probably the tipping point of his decision to leave.

If Lukaku had anywhere near the large ego you say he has he *would* have actually stuck around because he would probably think he is on par with Costa or could be better than him. Him leaving shows that he doesn't overestimate his ability and knows that Costa will start every game he can. The only times Lukaku would have had a chance is when Costa needed a breather, you really going to get mad at someone for not wanting that role instead of starting every single week for a decent PL club?


Edit: also, you seem to think that Lukaku never had discussions with the manager before he went on loan last season.  They can actually talk to each other you know... If Mourinho picked Ba and Torres over Lukaku for 4 games straight after he had a great pre season you have to realize that Mourinho probably told him that's where he was in the pecking order. And those subs that you were talking about were like 80th minute subs, pretty pointless.

true,dwair,null,Old man drink,"Yeah, I design and build back end systems for websites now but in my younger days (before computers) I was a mountaineering instructor so had to take what ever work I could find at times, which lead to several concurrent and ultimately doomed careers.  Things to do with the media was one of these.

I had a bit of interaction with Mr Bessed on the set.  We had to wait up at the top of a hill and then charge down a slope and attack a fort.  This process took the best part of 4 or 5 hours myself and half a dozen mates who were also extras on the set were basically entertained by him for the entire time.  Mr B is mental.  it is not an act.  He is genuinely a nice guy but completely unhinged and this was 20+ years ago.

Willow...  The part of N.Wales I was living in at the time was really being pushed as a film location so in the space of a few years there was loads of extra's work (as well as other stuff for electricians and catering) for major films so it was fairly easy to wander up onto a set and get a few weeks work doing something or other.  

Willow arrived and me and me mate Alex rocked up and looking for extra work and couldn't get any.  So we asked the guy if there was any other work and were directed to a caravan.  We went in and the guy in there asked us if we knew about animals, to which we said yes (I had a dog) and were directed to someone else.  We were then told to go to another caravan.  We went in, said to the woman that Mr X had sent us and we were there about the animals.  She sat us down and started going off on one about all these pigs that she wanted while we sat there nodding wondering what the hell was going on.  30 mins later we left with a load of blank purchase orders, a mission to get 250 pigs and we set off to the library (this was in the days before the internet) to get a book on pigs.

After that it was a matter of ringing people up and asking them to do things for us and billing the production company.  We got some pens built close to where the pigs were needed on set, ordered some feed and stuff, found a tame vet called Tammy (who was a friend of a friend) and went to a local abattoir and bought 250 pigs on sale or return for a month, to be replaced in 30 days with the same.  Pigs arrived in trucks and we got the entire crew to hold 4""X 3"" plywood boards to make a channel to the pens whilst we chased the pigs off the lorry's.  This worked. The pigs were on set.

All went fine, they did bits of filming with our stars and we looked after their every need.  Then came the day of the big night shoot.  A massive castle had been built in an abandoned slate quarry and lots of people were going to be turned into pigs in front of it.  Fine.  All we had to do was set up the crew with boards and do the same as before on a lager scale.  Cameras were positioned in plywood bunkers, the entire crew issued with the 4""X 3"" plywood boards and we waited for the signal to go.

When requested, we opened the pens and encouraged the pigs to leave.  The pigs were not used to doing this on mass, so became very excited.  Very, very excited.  Off they went down their plywood channel in a stampede, only to get to the other end, find their way blocked and then they panicked.  40kg of panicking pig is a thing to behold.  Several hundred of them freaking out is really scary.  The nerve of the crew broke and then pigs breached the human line like a medieval berserker army breaking through a shield wall in a battle.  They were free!!

There was chaos.  People were trampled and bitten, equipment destroyed and 250 pigs baled off into the darkness to roam round the quarry.  It took us days to find them all - well about 175 of them.  God knows where the rest ended up.  Peoples freezers no doubt.  I know I ate a hell of a lot of pork for the next year or so :)

Luckily the film company got all the shots they wanted and we were highly praised for our efforts (but never got a mention in the credits although our boss did)

Paying by card or cash is fine but if your card doesn't do chip and pin paying by card may be a bit awkward.

Some changing rooms operate a system where they give you a tag with the number of items you're bringing in. When you exit the changing room you give the assistant the tag and any clothes you don't want back. If you're shopping on a quiet day there might not be an assistant at the entrance to the changing room. In that case just go on in and return the clothes to the rail if you're not buying them.

On the same subject most people will bring a few sizes in with them rather than get the assistant to get a different size from the shop floor. ",0,1409124578,null,0,false,0,ck1oloo,t3_2ep0o3,t1_ck1oloo,t3_2ep0o3,null,1427338093,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Up to that point I was with you; perhaps I should have added that we don't look behind the vote *when determining the result*. We look behind the vote when dealing with policy issues and whatever else (e.g. the two referenda on the Lisbon Treaty in Ireland).

I don't know how clear it was to different people that the Spitzenkandidaten process was the one that was going to win; the Lisbon Treaty made it clear that the Parliament got to elect the President, and the leaders of the Parliamentary groups were pretty clear they were going to go with that policy.

However, complaints of ""democratic illegitimacy"" are nonsense. The wider message of the vote was that the vast majority of people in the EU are perfectly happy with it, and there is a small minority that voted for reactionary parties. As for circumventing the choices of governments, to the extent the EU did that (given that the European Council still nominated Juncker, and he will have to go with their proposals for commissioners even if they are all men) they are doing so to satisfy the Parliament - making things *more* democratic, not less - and arguably more democratic than the UK, where the Parliament doesn't get a formal vote on the Prime Minister, nor on his cabinet.

Let's begin with the obvious. I'm not sure I trust a news organisation of any kind that can have an article up for three years and not realise that it has mis-spelled the name of the person they're talking to. The doctor in question is not Dr. Clifford Scott but Dr. Clifford Stott. 

Secondly, let us discuss that this is a man with...shall we say vested interest in law enforcement? The news site's full name is Crime Reduction Partnership News. It's not a news organisation, it's a business, son.

Thirdly, the reasoning behind Dr. Stott's paper (Which I'm guessing you didn't buy so, fuck it, I'm not gonna buy it either) appears to indicate that every member of a mob is cogent. This tells us...precisely dick.

I think Wikipedia puts it best, honestly, when on the article about Crowd Psychology (The very field Dr Stott is, according to his facebook page a ""world leading expert"") it says
&gt;Social identity theory posits that the self is a complex system made up primarily of the concept of membership or non-membership in various social groups. These groups have various moral and behavioral values and norms, and the individual's actions depend on which group membership (or non-membership) is most personally salient at the time of action.[9] This influence is evidenced by findings that when the stated purpose and values of a group changes, the values and motives of its members are shown to also change.[19] Crowds are an amalgam of individuals, all of whom belong to various conflicting groups. However, if the crowd is primarily related to some identifiable group (such as Christians or civil-rights activists), then the values of that group will dictate crowd action.[9] In crowds which are more ambiguous, individuals will assume a new social identity as a member of the crowd.[1] This group membership is made more salient by confrontation with other groups, a relatively common occurrence for crowds

Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_psychology#Social_identity_theory

With a total of four attached sources to the paragraph itself.

Funnily enough, Dr Stott is not linked as a source in that article. Not even in the ""further reading"" section at the bottom that nobody ever looks at.

I'm sorry, but I don't think you can post an openly biased ""news"" organisation's report on a source as equal to the source itself. If this Dr. Stott were even half as good as he claims then the London Riots would never have gotten off the ground because he claims to have discovered the power to basically manipulate entire crowds as early as January 2011. The London Riots happened in August.

So between his inexplicable claim which is neither original to him (earliest reference I could find to the idea was in the 1920's by Henri Tajfel) nor particularly reliable given that there are six current competing theories (Namely Le Bon, Freudian, Deindividuation, Convergence, Emergent Norm and Social Identity theories) and his apparantely self-aggrandising and self-promotion, not to mention the apparant lack of any law enforcement in the western world calling him at any time in the last couple of years (Because, you know, Ferguson, riots in Greece, protests in Brazil, the London Riots, no NONE of those would be the perfect place to stick a ""world leading expert"" on mob mentality into a position of authority, oh hells to the no)  then yeah I say your boy's bunk, yo.

If you don't these are also rebroadcast through a number of channels (but in much lower quality) and the obvious place to start for these links is Wiziwig, as mentioned.

Use [this link](http://www.livesoccertv.com/competitions/england/championship/) on the day of the match to see if BeIn are broadcasting.

As for highlights, this is much easier and the official WWFC YouTube channel is the obvious place to start. [Sky Sports highlights](http://www1.skysports.com/footballleague/) are also available around the same time. Both of these might be geo-restricted as you are in the US but can be easily got round using either Hola or a decent VPN.

You don't remember berating Chelsea fans on /r/soccer to be delusional since they wanted Ramires to start last year (before we got Fabregas so it made no fucking sense)? You're always doing inflammatory shit like this and you seem to think you're better than every other fan.

I'll give you the AVB season fuckup, but everything else doesn't show Lukaku has a backbone. It shows the opposite for me.

So your argument is that because a player not even 21 years old wasn't the starter over veterans after just four games despite a good preseason, he didn't get a fair chance and Mourinho set the pecking order permanently? 

Do you even know Mourinho? He's always been a manager who gives everybody a fair chance to become a starter as the season progress. Lukaku just thought he was a special little snowflake who didn't have to do that and loans at smaller clubs were good enough. The most recent examples are Dave over Cole (a Chelsea legend) and Oscar over Mata. Especially with the part of the season last year where Mourinho complained about his strikers not being able to score, I have no doubt in my mind that Lukaku would have been given a run of games to take the spot and probably would have taken it, if he was willing to stay and fight for his spot a bit longer. Him not being the starter after a month of games does not mean he wouldn't have gotten consistent game time had he some patience. Just because Filipe Luis isn't the starter right now doesn't mean he won't have the starting spot over Ivanovic in a few weeks/months.

I have no problem with leaving since we bought Costa if he wants to be the guaranteed starter elsewhere, but that shows me he has no ""backbone"" if he doesn't believe he's good enough to overtake him. Also, are you serious about the Drogba comment? Drogba would have been a mentor to him, how is us signing a 36 year old Drogba (with a significant focus on mentoring the youth) the tipping point? Give me a break.

There's a difference between ego and confidence you seem to be missing. Him staying, being patient and working hard to overtake Costa shows his confidence in his abilities as a striker. How the fuck is that having an ego? An ego is when you think that you should be the starter at such a young age after being a sub 3 times in 4 games. Trying to overtake the expected starter by being patient and overplaying the expected starter when you get a chance is not having an ego at all. How did even reach that conclusion? Are you willing to say that Dave last season or anybody else who's not in the starting XI after the first few games has an ego then?

I'm not mad at him at all for leaving to get a bigger role, I'm annoyed that you think he has a backbone for doing so. That's not what a backbone is. Otherwise you have a very warped view of having a backbone.

I never said or thought that Lukaku and Mourinho never talked. You seem to think that Mourinho is the type of manager who has a rigid pecking order, which is just false. In fact, it's the opposite. Mourinho is a merit-based manager who gives everybody a chance to become the starter if he deems them ready.

true,BaBaFiCo,derbyshire,S. Derbyshire,"There's a fine line between being a bit drunk and dressed provocatively (perfectly fine) and being such a drunken mess on your own that you don't know what you're doing (dangerous). This is just common sense but the problem is that we have to tread carefully to avoid blaming the victim in such a circumstance. 

Ignoring the emotions of the crime to look at it objectively, it's the difference between forgetting to lock your front door and leaving a wide open window whilst you're on holiday for the week and then being burgled. If you did the latter, people would rightly say that you invited criminal activity. The same can be said to be true of rape. Of course, we should not take away responsibility from the rapist, but it stands to reason, when most crimes are opportunistic, that someone hoping to be safe should remove as many opportunities as possible. Women, and men, should feel safe no matter their circumstances in an ideal and civilised world, but unfortunately that isn't the case. 

I myself was mugged walking home once because I was obviously far too intoxicated. I suspect if I wasn't, I wouldn't have been chosen as a victim for that crime. The same could be said of some rape victims. THIS DOES NOT MAKE THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CRIME. Throughout, the rapist is always the one responsible for the crime in question and the one who makes all of the active choices to commit the crime. However, a victim does sometimes make passive choices, such as becoming dangerously intoxicated, that unfortunately aid the attacker. 

It comes down to being safe. People know that they should stay in brightly lit areas, avoid walking alone as much as possible and try to keep people informed of where you are. Being overly intoxicated is another variable that should be managed by anyone who wishes to decrease their chances of being a victim of crime.

His ESRC research subsequently provided evidence that this ‘evidence based’ policing approach contributed to the low levels of violent confrontation during the tournament. As a reflection of this success, proposals based upon Dr Stott's research were accepted as amendments to the 2005 and 2010 editions of the European Union's main policy documents for police cooperation surrounding international football competitions such as the UEFA European Championships, Champions and Europa Leagues.Dr Stott has subsequently advised and trained police commanders across Europe and Australia. His research underpinned the €1.1 million Pan European Football Police Training Project, delivering customised training to 250 police officers from 21 European countries.Reforms to the Association of Chief Police Officers' national guidance on the policing of public order in the UK (2010) were drawn directly from Dr Stott's input into the Inspectorate of the Constabulary’s (HMIC) inquiry into public order policing, following the death of Mr Ian Tomlinson during the ‘G20’ protests in London in 2009.

true,Capsulets,cnty-uk,United Kingdom,"&gt; If you were investigating child abuse in Rotherham, and you noticed that many children reported being abused by men, many by Asians, and many by people from a particular area, which bit of information would help you find out if their was a syndicate conspiring to abuse children?

All of them. It wouldn't be all the evidence you need, but without any of that information it would be much harder to proceed. 

As i said before, only 3% of the population of Rotherham is Asian, and there are specific areas where high numbers of them live, so not only does the information narrow down who the perpetrators are, (there are probably only around 3000 Asian men living in Rotherham), it also narrows down where they live.

 I'm not a police officer, but I would imagine you would be able to look at the locations where the girls were picked up, children's homes ect... And compare that to the locations where there are high Asian populations, and see if there was any relation. If there were a lot of children being abused in an area around one particular location of high Asia population, there's a good chance the perpetrators live there, which narrows the search even further.

As Carra pointed out on MNF, it's more of a question of the back four finding equal spacing and moving as a unit.

Both sides are sticking to their ""no, *my* way is what will happen"" prior to the referendum itself, purely as a tactic to garner more votes.

IMO the most likely outcome is that there will be an arrangement, but it'll be called a ""monetary supervisory arrangement"" or ""fiscal oversight board"" rather ""currency union"".

In Scotland it would be be pitched as ""see, we can keep using our pound"" and in rUK it would be pitched as ""we'll exert tight control to protect jobs and industry in the North from financial instability in Scotland"". Both sides will get to claim a victory, and may or may not give up something else they want in order to achieve it (greater or lesser share of the debt, extended lease of Faslane for Trident, etc).

Scotland walking away from its share of the UK's debt is, like the UK unilaterally seizing assets in Scotland, a breakdown of negotiations. An unlikely breakdown, but a possible one. What it's not is ""a default"".

Markets will certainly view you as a riskier entity to lend to if you've failed to repay money you owe, but they're not going to care one way or the other if negotiations between Scotland and rUK break down.

What they care about is ""if we lend money to Scotland, would we get it back"".

I'm saying it's a contributing factor - it's a highly complex situation (as are all social issues). The Police are afraid of conducting a widescale public operation against a specific culture - think it's pretty obvious why - especially given the bad publicity the SYP have received since Hillsborough. 

But likewise, the Police in Rotherham are predominantly white. There is a problem with their ability to integrate with minority cultures. The Government is also responsible. Rotherham is fucking poor, the area around Rotherham is one of the most impoverished and desperate regions in Europe - and yet the Government still deems it appropriate to locate thousands of migrants there. What's more, they locate asylum seekers and migrants all in the same areas, which totally overwhelm the extant habitants causing decades of resentment. Walls go up, ghettos form, communication and empathy is non-existent.

This would be the equivalent of seeing someone get raped and stabbed in front of you and not telling the police because the perpetrator was black. **No one does that**, and the only time you would is if you wanted to pull a smoke-screen and attempt to publicly exonerate yourself.

true,LandauTST,tardis,TARDIS,"See, I never even understood the whole ""it's not me, but don't let the children see"" thing. I was one of those children who saw stuff like this growing up and realized that, when you take all judgement out of the equation, it was really quite easy for me to understand when my mother explained it (when her guy friend came out as gay (and later, a cross dresser)). It taught me tolerance and understanding at a young age. But most of the time, I never thought one way or the other about it. It was just another thing that made some other human beings different, but made them no better or worse. 

I never even knew there was such hatred until later on when Ellen Degeneres came out and I remember watching her crying and reading hate mail and threats she received during an interview on TV. And ever since then, the hatred was the only thing I never understood.

So it may make me a bit of an asshole but...Yeah, I do think the people who were upset over something that wasn't even really a kiss are wrong. ~*shrug*~ It wasn't much different than CPR, really. She needed oxygen. 

Not to mention there was a lot of emphasis in the episode that just because someone is *different* doesn't make them *bad*. Plus the emphasis on Jenny and Vastra's marriage and, not only being both female, but two different species. The whole thing was pretty much about tolerance and understanding.

Basically what I'm saying is that you shouldn't rule out the possibility that historic Protestant and Catholic sex crimes (meaning last 10 or 15 years, obviously not the Crusades or Inquisition) indicate that there is nothing exceptional about the races of the people involved in Rotherham. By keeping your options as broad as possible, this means if it comes out that a particular ethnicity is significantly more likely to abuse children people will find it much harder to call you a racist because you deliberately set yourself up to be proved wrong and yet still found that the data supported your hypothesis.

It looks likely to me (scanning the data, no detailed look) that sex crimes are committed pretty much equally by all ethnicities, but that this particular kind of paedophilia is exclusively a Pakistani Muslim problem.

After all, nothing stops any country from going ""we've decided that this debt was a trick, you pay-day loaned the entire country so we're not paying""; and there is nothing the lender can do about it -- it's not like you can get the bailiffs in for a country.  So why don't they?  Because the _next_ loan won't happen; when the country says ""right, please lend us some money"", the market says ""Woah, woah, woah.  You didn't pay back the last lot, why should we lend you any more?"".  The answer will then have to be ""because we'll pay you Wonga rates, instead of the usual 0.1%"".

With that in mind then it really doesn't matter whether Scotland agrees to take on debt or not, what matters is if the lending markets believe they owe the money and defaulted on it.  That will show them to be a bad debt, and they won't get the next loan.  And an independent Scotland _is_ going to need that next loan.

It would be wrong to say such radical feminists don’t exist (and I hesitate to call them feminists as they give a worthwhile movement a bad name)…

But I can also sympathise as a man and a victim of domestic violence with the issues our society has in recognising that it’s a problem at all – with men feeling they can’t raise it as a concern because they won’t be believed / should just ‘man up’ etc. 

I’m revolted by the idea of such violence at this point – I wouldn’t wish it on any person – but in terms of support frame works and acknowledging there’s a problem (right now) it’s skewed in favour of women and there’s little tuition that such violence affects men and is wrong to commit against men also. 

Going back to the comment /u/BritishPetrolium made – obviously satire (whether you like it or not is another matter, but it’s too obviously satire to be taken seriously) – I think that’s more a smear against radical / extremist feminists than against the idea of feminism in general.

More complex than that.

You can overtake a cyclist with inches to spare, at excessive speed, get caught on camera and not receive any fine or points at all. The only time motorists will receive any fine/punishment is if they kill or hurt someone....which of of no help to anyone.

Compare that with cyclists on the pavement (who for the most part might be dicks, but at the same time are avoiding roads because of other dicks) who will receive a fine by default (if caught) regardless if they are putting people in danger or not.



Personally I don't think the solution is registration (we have talked about this before, but the long and the short of it is its counter productive). The real solution's is probably Presumed liability -  Which would never stop the act of being a dick, but might go some way to change the attitude of dicks on the road and pavement.

Opening a bank account is easy. You walk into a bank office and with your ID card you are set in no time. 

You're still able to get free banking, with no requirements of minimum account balance. The banks have a digital ID card, called ""BankID"", which allows me to identify myself both to my bank, but also to authorities through my smartphone. For example, when doing taxes I go to the tax authority's web page, choose BankID as sign in method, type in my personal number (sort of social security number, but based on my birthdate + 4 numbers) and then start the app on my smartphone. I type in my code in the app and I'm logged in. 

I guess a lot of it is thanks to infrastructure, both physical like good internet connections, and process, like the ""personnummer"" and a central registry of all citizens.

true,McCackle,eng-sussex,West Sussex,"&gt; the Lisbon Treaty made it clear that the Parliament got to elect the President

Well, of course this is what is hotly disputed. The truth is that the issue was deliberately (and disastrously) fudged in the wording of the Lisbon Treaty. If it had been a settled, agreed position that the Parliament should elect the President then the wording would have been unequivocal.

&gt; However, complaints of ""democratic illegitimacy"" are nonsense.

Well, no. There have been varying degrees of EU democratic deficit recognised in recent years. These are debated but my understanding is that it is generally accepted that the EU lacks democratic legitimacy in some ways. Indeed, the campaign for Spitzenkandidaten was itself predicated on the idea that more democratic legitimacy was needed.

When it comes to whether the current situation is democratically illegitimate, you can of course point to Spitzenkandidaten as being *more* democratically legitimate in some ways. But that is to cherry pick and close one's eyes to the wider issue of whether or not power has been improperly and undemocratically seized from the Council (who are the member states' democratically elected leaders) and appropriated by the Parliament (who many voters would consider lesser representatives than their own national parliaments). I fully understand why some people prefer the idea that the elected European Parliament should elect the European President, but it is just a preference and is certainly no more legitimate than the idea that the democratically elected governments of member states should elect the European President.

The whole thing is an embarrassing mess, and that only compounds problems of democratic legitimacy. These are obvious issues and to dismiss them as ""nonsense"" is to overstate.",0,1409132273,null,0,false,0,ck1q2x4,t3_2eluwi,t1_ck1q2x4,t1_ck1ox2d,null,1427337402,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

My main issue with the article is as follows, I’ll try and sum it up as best I can. 

I’m a male victim of domestic violence. I wouldn’t claim to be so heavily affected as a rape victim for instance, but it has turned me on to paying attention to the topic. 

I mention that because like male sexual assault victims ‘we’ tend to be sidelined in terms of what society fights against. On paper most people would hopefully say ‘well of course it’s not OK’ but most campaigns are aimed against or are about female victims. 

My main complaint then is the imbalance in where or how society focuses its efforts to stop this issue. Even recently the Telegraph reported on a new law that would stop *men hitting their wives* in relationship based domestic violence. You had to read several paragraphs in to find that the law would also affect women – but the headline and imagery were all very much portraying women as the victims and men as the aggressors. 

Whilst that does happen – I am absolutely in favour of equality. We’re not going to get the message across to violent women or anyone who thinks it’s OK to assault or sexually assault males (boys or men) – if we campaign with bias towards female victims alone. I am in favour of acknowledging both and ignoring neither.

I'm not sweeping the errors of drivers under the carpet - but the time for ignoring cyclists purely because there are bad drivers is coming to an end. Why should that be so? 

We really *do* live with bad cyclists who disregard the law with impunity. That's not right. 

The trouble with not having registration is that if a car is filmed doing something illegal you can get the number plate and you *have that person* (assuming the car isn't stolen - most aren't). 

With cyclists you have literally nothing so the chances of it coming to anything are far lower. Most motorists will obey traffic laws - let's face it, the grand majority aren't that bad (as with cyclists) and registration and the knowledge 'if I break the law and someone sees / records / catches me, I can be tracked by my details' goes some way towards that. 

Cyclists need that. We need some way of catching those who jump lights or crossings or hop on pavements and enforcing that it's *not* OK.

By the time you are reading this, it might be hard to grasp how deep and how enduring was the silence around these grooming gangs and their victims. But in 2012 Andrew Norfolk, a principal journalist for The Times, stated “when we first started to investigate this 2 years ago, no-one [from the child-care professions] would speak to us.” A journalist of long-standing, with an impeccable record, working for one of the most respected newspapers in the world, could not get professionals in 21st century Britain to speak to him about a phenomenon that is probably the worst child-care scandal in the country in 40 years. It is a situation which defies belief. These were public servants, who would not talk about child-rape and prostitution, which they knew had been going on for years. They were not the rapists. They were not being paid by the criminals. But political-correctness and multiculturalism had left them too scared to speak about these horrific crimes. No wonder these grooming gangs felt untouchable. The conflicts and confusions caused by multiculturalism left the staff unsure of their moral and professional values; the tyranny of political correctness meant they did not dare articulate or even acknowledge what they were seeing and hearing.    

When he testified before parliament, Andrew Norfolk said that after he published his analysis of the pattern of exploitation in January 2011, showing that Muslim men were massively over-represented as the perpetrators, suddenly he:
was contacted by so many people who had refused to speak to me before. When you have a Director of Children’s Services ringing and saying, “My staff are jumping for joy in the office today because finally somebody has said what we have not felt able to say,” and when you have very senior police officers saying exactly the same.    

Those who are responsible for instilling such fear into public officials
should be held accountable.
In a later analysis, Andrew Norfolk reported on the hundreds of unpublished reports on Muslim grooming gangs in Rotherham by police and social services. For example, in 2002 a Home Office funded research project showed that 56 schoolgirls had sexual links to 3 Pakistani brothers. This had all the hallmarks of “localised grooming.” Police and social services discussed this case for years without ever identifying that the men were Muslims; they never acknowledged publicly what was going on and, according to Andrew Norfolk, they never did anything to stop it. They were “terrorised” by political correctness and multiculturalism.",0,1409133327,null,0,false,0,ck1q9ej,t3_2eoqjz,t1_ck1q9ej,t1_ck1q6e0,null,1427337319,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

My previous comment – well there’s not much to expand on there. If you look around the internet properly you can easily find people who attack men as a gender with no real logic or appropriateness behind it. 

Hell – there’s a girl who attended a local university here in Birmingham who would often rant (and I do mean rant) about men purely for being men. She’d accuse otherwise reasonable people of sexism purely because of their gender if they ever engaged in a debate about completely separate topics with her. She actively sought that kind of conflict out. 

I met another girl at a party recently who fell into an argument with me when she tried to argue that women were superior to men in the IT industry. I pointed out that actually it was down to the merits of the individual and not about gender at all (both women and men are equally capable of being good at it – neither are any better than the other) – so she hit me in the arm (and not in a playful manner – it was the kind of punch I’d take as a warning – and if I had done the same to her she would have raised hell about it).

This article isn't proof that feminists have succeeded in their quest to oppress and silence male victims. Nor does it in any way minimise the scale or impact of abuse on female victims. There is nothing wrong with acknowledging that certain groups in society are less likely to report abuse and less likely to receive an appropriate response from frontline services when they do make a disclosure. 

The process of reporting sexual abuse is extremely difficult and potentially traumatic for all victims. I have personally heard a Police Officer interrogate a 13 year old girl about why she decided to wear a short dress (in the height of summer) to a party where she was raped. I have also worked with a 17 year old boy who was the victim of homophobic bullying after he disclosed sexual abuse from his Uncle. Both of these incidents are a sad reflection of societies attitude to gender. Increasing awareness and support for male victims does not have to be to the detriment of females and vice versa. It is simply about recognising that different groups have different challenges.

&gt;___The Warlock of Firetop Mountain___ is a single-player [adventure gamebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_gamebook) written by [Steve Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jackson_(UK_game_designer\)) and [Ian Livingstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Livingstone), and illustrated by [Russ Nicholson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Nicholson). Originally published by [Puffin Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffin_Books) in 1982, the title is the first gamebook in the [Fighting Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Fantasy) series. It was later republished by __Wizard Books__ in 2002. As well as launching the Fighting Fantasy series, the gamebook inspired two direct sequels, four novels and was adapted into a [board game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game) and a video game.

/r/tumblrinaction isn't a source. It's a repository of the kind of thing that a lot of these idiots spew.

I want to take you on a journey, for a moment. Imagine you're 12. You're growing up in a time of instant, constant online communication. You're also at an age when groups are formed as much by who you all agree to dislike as anything else, an age when insults don't actually carry much weight individually, and the spirit in which they're given is much more important.

You go on the internet, and you make some god awful remark about getting back into the kitchen or faggotry. Which of the following is more likely to happen?

1. A feminist/gender equalist (or however you spell that) takes the time out of their day to explain to your immature mind why such comments are wrong, and shows you some resources by which you can understand the issue. You're not likely to look at them, because, shit, you're 12, you've got that first zit and homework to worry about and this is just some dumb randomer on the internet.

2. Everyone in chat ignores the stupid 12 year old, knowing that, eventually, they'll be shown the error of their ways, or fail to become a productive member of society. It's not really their job to go around educating people, and they don't have much vested interest.

3. A ""feminist"" comes along and berates them, stating such things as ""it's not my job to educate you, shitlord"", making veiled threats and basically doing a good job of being an immature asshole while wearing the badge of feminism.

Tumblr has a very young userbase, over half college age or younger. This is the age range where people form a lot of their beliefs. They're plastic enough to have their minds changed, not jaded enough to be cynical of new drives, and eager to form an identity by which they can join a group larger than themselves, forming a self-protecting group.

They also tend to take things very literally, and from a skewed view. Without outside moderation, these beliefs within a group become self-reinforcing. They're skewed from a lack of discussion/dissenting opinion and the idea that they're trying to do good and anyone that disagrees must be trying to do bad. Parents don't yet have the understanding that they should be monitoring their children's activities online, and it falls out of a school's remit. Unless they say something serious enough to get the police involved, there's likely going to be no IRL intervention for this behavior in any individual. 

True equality issue studies, much like true religious education, does not exist in schools on a meaninful level. It does not exist on television, because it's a solved problem, by and large (""women and men are equal, black/white/asian/etc are all equal, etc, don't be a dick). It doesn't exist to the parents, because they've got little idea that there's an issue. So where are these impressionable young minds going to get their first, and lasting, idea of what feminism means? Fucktard jackasses spewing veiled, discriminatory, sectional hatred on the internet.

So, on one hand, you've got a group of loud teens/college students who are very vocal and have a lot of time on their hands, in an insular and frankly almost cult-like online community in which is it perfectly acceptable to dox 15 year olds. On the other hand, you've got a group of loud teens/college students whose only interaction with feminism is a brick wall of ""go and educate yourself, it's not my job to educate you, I just want to shout and moan with people who share my ideas.""",0,1409134099,null,0,false,0,ck1qe3x,t3_2epcv8,t1_ck1qe3x,t1_ck1q4e3,null,1427337257,10,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,10

Therefore, WHO currently recommends that smokers should first be encouraged to quit smoking and nicotine addiction by using a combination of already-approved treatments.

&gt;In addition, the report says existing evidence shows that e-cigarette aerosol is not merely ""water vapour"" as is often claimed in the marketing of these products. While they are likely to be less toxic than conventional cigarettes, e-cigarette use poses threats to adolescents and foetuses of pregnant mothers using these devices.

&gt;E-cigarettes also increase the exposure of non-smokers and bystanders to nicotine and a number of toxicants, the report says.

&gt;

&gt;The __2014–15 UEFA Champions League__ is the 60th season of Europe's premier club [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) tournament organised by [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA), and the 23rd season since it was renamed from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the [UEFA Champions League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League).

&gt;The [2015 UEFA Champions League Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_UEFA_Champions_League_Final) will be played at the [Olympiastadion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiastadion_(Berlin\)) in [Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin), Germany.  [Real Madrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F.) are the title holders.

&gt;This will be the first season where clubs must comply with [UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Financial_Fair_Play_Regulations) in order to participate.  Moreover, this season was the first where a club from [Gibraltar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar) competed in the tournament, after the [Gibraltar Football Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar_Football_Association) was accepted as the 54th UEFA member at the UEFA Congress in May 2013.  They were granted one spot in the Champions League,  which was taken by [Lincoln Red Imps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Red_Imps_FC), the champions of the [2013–14 Gibraltar Premier Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_Gibraltar_Premier_Division).

I get at least one twat to deal with every week (and i live in sleepy Norwich, not somewhere like London), and I can tell you categorically that I receive way more aggravation on a bike than in a car.

&gt;The trouble with not having registration is that if a car is filmed doing something illegal you can get the number plate and you have that person (assuming the car isn't stolen - most aren't).

If a car is filmed on a particular street then yes it might receive a fine or points. Many towns don't have speed cameras on every road, and many motorists know this.

It also goes back to my point about bad overtakes by motorists being caught by cyclists with camera. In 99pc of those occasions the number plate is taken, and in 100pc of cases the police at most will ""have a word""

&gt;but we can in theory do both, we don't have to choose.

You can tackle both by tackling aggressive behavior on the roads. Targeting one group - who for the most part are scared of the other group is not going to help.

Chief police officers, who are responsible for enforcement, acknowledge that many cyclists, particularly children and young people, are afraid to cycle on the road, sensitivity and careful use of police discretion is required.

&gt; I should stress that the issue is about inconsiderate cycling on the pavements. The new provisions are not aimed at responsible cyclists who sometimes feel obliged to use the pavement out of fear of the traffic, and who show consideration to other road users when doing so. Chief officers recognise that the fixed penalty needs to be used with a considerable degree of discretion and it cannot be issued to anyone under the age of 16.

Essentially, that cycling on the pavements is broadly tolerated so long as cyclists are considerate of pedestrians.

It's not as if there's no precedent for what will happen if Scotland refuses to repay any debts the rUK considers it is owed, neither.  The Anglo-Irish trade war completely crippled the Irish economy, reducing the Irish to bartering, because they tried to renege on debts owed to the UK.

Lastly, the SNP's rhetoric here is really self-defeating.  A large percentage of the SNP's plans for an independent Scotland require the participation and co-operation of a large number of external actors, but mainly the rUK and EU.  For everything not to go pear-shaped quickly, the rUK has to agree to quite favourable terms (entry into a currency union, no vetoing of EU membership, entry into the CTA, not pulling state-owned banks out of Scotland, favourable terms for tax arrangements on cross-border pensions, and so on).  Yet, from down South, the SNP's rhetoric only serves to piss the people off who will need to agree to all of those, namely the English, Welsh and Northern Irish.  There's threats of walking away from the debt, there's promises to undercut the UK's tax rates, there's plans to pursue a special exemption from the EU so that English students continue to pay for Scottish university education, whilst Irish ones do not, and so on.  It's really quite bizarre and is just leading to the public in rUK digging their heals in further when asked about the possibility of e.g. a currency union.  In trying to shore up domestic support, goodwill amongst the public in the rest of the UK is evaporating quickly.",0,1409136469,null,0,1409137297,0,ck1qti5,t3_2epbdq,t1_ck1qti5,t1_ck1osgt,null,1427337058,13,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,13

true,Zanriel,null,null,"Personally, I find both new and old equally appealing, but for different reasons. That said, I do think the revived show could take some lessons from the classic series, as there are a few elements from the '63-'89 run that are superior. Every Doctor Who fan should make it a point to watch as much of the Classic series as they can. At least it'll give you something to do in between episodes! I'll do my best to explain:

First off, it's a lot more palatable than old Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers, etc. It has a lot more style and substance, and even the B&amp;W episodes don't feel as dated somehow. It takes a bit of patience to get into it, but pretty soon you start to light up inside and you come to appreciate it for all its quirks and personality.

Whereas the New Series practically spoon feeds itself to you, with slick production values, epic music, and breakneck pacing, the classic series demands something quite different from its audience in order to appreciate it. Because the shows were done on a shoestring budget under crushing deadlines, they often come across almost like stage plays. In order to get the most out of them, you have to suspend your disbelief and use your imagination. In this way, it's a more interactive experience, almost like reading a book.

The payoff is that it puts you in the same place you were as a child playing make believe out in the back yard or on the playground. Another result is that the stories are presented with a level of heart and sincerity that you hardly ever see anymore.

The pacing is a bit slower, with more time put into each scene, but there's plenty of action, humor, and suspense. There's more subtlety and nuance. It's full of wit and charm, and at its best, many of the stories provide timely commentary and critique on political, cultural, and social issues, much like literature. There's a reason why it's the most studied and talked about show ever made, even before the new revival.

The best place to start would probably to get a list of key stories where major foes and allies were introduced, or lore was established.

This thread has a few good suggestions:

http://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/2eja4p/past_doctor_stories/

Also, check out Youtube for some Classic Who documentaries and interviews. Watching those should give you an appreciation for what a precious cultural treasure Classic Who really is. One in particular, which isn't on Youtube, and you really have to dig for, is called [The Story of Doctor Who](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393826/). I had to go through duckduckgo.com to find it but it's worth it.

It's not feminism that we need to stop them influencing. It's the impressionable young people outside of feminism. They need to be educated, and at the moment, their education is largely that it's not a feminist's job to educate.

&gt;It may appear that way if your only entry point to feminism is /r/TumblrInAction or your average white male supremacy board.

I reached this anti-feminist conclusion as a young adult just from reading about college feminists getting angry about statues of depressed males and the fact that tumblr exists. It doesn't require existing opposing extremism to create an extremist opinion about an extremist opinion, and the idea that multiple people are coming to the same opinion independantly is indicative of a problem (perhaps on both sides).

&gt;Rape happens. It happens for a lot of reasons. 

Agreed.

&gt;Feminism is generally concerned about the portion of rapes that happen because men are taught by our culture that they have a right to have sex with a woman

In my personal experience (as I haven't been offered, nor found, unbiased statistics to prove otherwise), the proportion of men who are raped by women under the guise of ""you have an erection, you want me, lets fuck"" is about equal. Their proportional representation in most feminist postings that I've seen are not.

&gt;or that they for one reason or another face impunity if they use sex and violence to assert power

I'm not going to argue this point, as I don't know enough about it. However, it's worth noting that the opposite is true; there are multiple documented cases of women hitting men, in public, on camera, seemingly without repercussion. When the man defends himself, he's at fault. Of course, it doesn't always play out like this, but this is a situation that isn't entirely uncommon among DV/general violence cases.

&gt;That doesn't mean that feminists as individuals don't condemn all kinds of rape, and actively support victims of all genders. 

Some of them certainly don't. There are Women and Children shelters all over the west. It made the news when the first Men's refuge opened in 2003. The company that set it up is named as being at the forefront of male DV help in the UK. It has 4 part-time staff, plus volunteers, and received £50,000 in funding in 2010. I doubt Women's Aid could run on that. Equivalents across the pond are harassed into shutting down. Earl Silverman, who ran such a shelter, committed suicide in 2013 in a last ditch effort to prove to people that this issue is real, after 20 years of trying to convince them. A lot of people do not support victims of all genders seriously.

&gt;But all rapes are not committed for the same reasons, and all rapists are not the same.

I think underwear depends on the shop and what sort you're buying; they might not let you take a pair of knickers out of a four-pack to try on, but you'll be able to ask a shop assistant.

* We don't tend to do free samples. Aside from that I can't think of anything peculiar to Britain; don't behave like a twat and you should be good. Also, don't expect the same level of customer service you'd get in America, since that's on another level entirely. 

* Depends on the shop. They will usually have their returns policy on their website or pinned up on the wall behind the till, and if in doubt you can ask. Chain/high street shops will almost always have decent returns policies, but some independent shops will have signs saying they are unable to accept returns (those clothes do also tend to be massively cheaper though).

* Not *so* unusual, I guess it depends how much you're buying. I wouldn't think anything of paying £10, £20 with cash, but anything over £50 I'd prefer to use my card since I'm not super happy carrying that much cash around in public. You may also find a couple of shops who refuse to deal with £50 notes, although again they tend to be smaller/family run.

The level of quality in this match last night was horrible. As experts said in the Norwegian champions league studio. Celtic's performance last night and earlier matches would probably not equate to a mid table position in the Norwegian league.  

Even though Maribor was the controlling team the first half both teams had embracingly bad touches, passes and finishes. Legia Warzawa would have steamrolled over Maribor,  no question about it.  

Kayal at least had his head on straight and managed to hold the ball and not kick it out headlessly. Johansen basically had nobody to pass to, and incredibly few options and initiatives around him this second leg. 

In second half as Berget kept producing decent runs and combinations with Stokes again and again on the left flank and the team was basically getting some confidence back, then Deila takes him off ?!?!  Nor does it help that they were maximum 2 person in the box, but stokes had mostly been busy on the flank with Berget.

Ambrose. I started wondering if he was paid to fuck  up. 5-6 situations involving him were beyond comprehension. 

Celtic seem to be missing two central defenders, Lustig is a right defender, Berget is traditionally a central forward but is among the few in my mind that had a passable performance last night.  With Scott Brown back the midfield might not be shrieking for strengthening, but they need a class striker. 

One could be Vidar Örn Kjartansson, 21 goals in 20 matches in Norway, natural striker, dead calm, finishes with both feet. 24yo, should be a steal since his current club is near bankrupt.

3. Yes but they have the capability to change. We're onto the third and sometimes forth generation of some Muslim families and they are still as homophobic as ever. I know that other groups can be homophobic but this group in particular shows resolve to never say homosexuality is okay, and their religious book 100% calls for it - there is no maybes about it like with Christianity. 

5. No, I sourced the statistic that 2/3 of Muslim adults don't work. That's a ridiculous statistic. How far does it have to go for you to be against more coming here enmasse? 10 million Pakistanis/Bangladeshis and only 1% work? After all it's not fair on the 1% yada yada yada.

true,FooFighterJL,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;Why would you say it is ludicrous ?

Because our Judicial system is based on the principal of separation of powers, meaning that Parliament and the Executive do not have sly interference with the rulings of the Courts. This is called Judicial Independence. If you do not understand this precedent, you do not understand the most fundamental mechanics of the western legal system. 

Judicial Neutrality is another matter and one that I think *is* a problem in the UK legal system. (The idea that the system should be blind toward certain factors within cases which I think is impossible when you consider the demographics of people in the law profession come from,e.g. all but one Supreme Court Justice was privately educated.)

To your question about the bankers:

Remember that the legal system can *only* prosecute when a law has been broken. Like I mentioned on my comment above, our Legislature (Parliament) has failed to keep up with modern times and thus crimes that would have been impossible to do 20 years ago are now possible and Parliament has not been keeping up with making them crimes. 

I agree, the actions of the banks/bankers (you name it) were, by any moral standard, wrong. But the Judicial system can only prosecute what is illegal. If you want to look at someone to blame here do not blame the Judiciary, blame the slow Legislature and the poor foresight of the Major, and even more so, Blair governments. 

&gt;Do you not think people with money have an advantage in the justice system?

This question is going to be formulating a considerable part of my second year law degree. I don't want to get ahead here but I will give you my most basic view as it stands at the moment. 

It is certainly the case that people with more money do better in court. The reason for this is not because they are favored by the Judges/jury (a few rare exception do apply) but rather because they can afford a lawyer who can make a case *stronger* than the prosecution. 

So is the problem money? Well that much should be obvious, but I think it takes more of an engine room role in the matter. I think the real problem is that the very best lawyers in our society can earn *a lot* more in defending people than it can prosecuting people for the CPS. As a result, the best lawyers play defense and the not so good ones play Prosecution. 

The CPS did actually begin to take some measures to try and combat this effect by hiring  a world class defense lawyer ([Keir Starmer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer)) to head up the CPS. This was a very successful move, but unfortunately the CPS has now gone back to a CPS insider to head up the CPS. 

It is frustrating when people who you really think are guilty appear to get away with the most heinous of crimes. A few things to keep in mind whenever this happens: 

1. Our Judicial system is founded on the principal that it is better for a guilty man to go free than an innocent man to be locked up. 

2. The media always paints a story that it thinks will sell the most copies. Reading through some of the papers commenting on legal issues, I often wonder how they can get away with misrepresenting the truth so unapologetically.

3. Its very easy to pin the blame in the wrong places. In this case people have the impression it was the Judicial system that failed when in fact it was more the failings of short-sited governments who were too slow to create laws that the CPS could work with.

Lot's decide they will go to the middle, and weight for a gap, the issue is that they often end up making other road users take action to avoid them in doing this.

[There's a junction I frequently jump, because the design is awful for a cyclist.](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@51.576669,-0.144911,3a,75y,115.95h,80.21t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sk2b-KbzvHWeNiJpXNXS0dA!2e0)

If you are travelling south down Archway Road, you will find two busy lanes of cars, merging into one.  The main problem is often people are very aggressive here, I hypothesise that two sets of red lights in close proximity (which they will have had coming from the North) make drivers more cuntish.

The other problem is, at 9am, the traffic just beyond the junction will be queueing, it is a bend, and has parked traffic on the left side.  As such as a cyclist I want to be more in the middle, rather than the gutter.  This is how the highway code says you should always ride, but as the legal action I'm currently taking shows, many drivers do not consider it acceptable for cyclists to do this.

Being ahead of them there is great for my own safety.  As you can see from that street view, the ped crossing has a countdown timer.  If there are no peds, I will gently go through at 2 seconds.  Yes, this is me breaking the law, stealing someone elses right of way for my own personal benefit, but I consider it justified under the circumstances, this means that I'll be at 20mph, happily passing the parked cars by the time the cars behind me have got the green.

It's always an odd one, because for my commute I will be about 10min faster by bicycle, than I would be by car.  Yet many cars are pre-occupied with over taking me.

I've never come close to hitting someone doing this, no one has had to take action to avoid me etc.  Yet I've hit a pedestrian before, because the dosy bint stepped into the bus lane without looking, her coffee ended up being flung over some poor passer by, quite the mess.",0,1409138527,null,0,false,0,ck1r8kq,t3_2epe3j,t1_ck1r8kq,t1_ck1r3ns,null,1427336863,7,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,7

 I guess it would depend on the context (how much they've had to drink, who initiated it, whether either wanted to stop et al).

Unless gift aid has changed since a few years ago when I did weekend volunteering at a charity shop, we just needed a goods donor to give their name, address and sign the declaration, and we could claim gift aid on their donated goods sold (then we gave them a card with a donor number on they could tell us when making future goods donations, so they only ever had to fill a form once). I just checked out the MND donation link OP posted, and since when you pay by card you have to give your name and address anyway, all you have to do for gift aid is actually press a tick box next to a declaration.

Believe me, charities make it as easy as possible to gift aid your donations.

I commute along a canal by bike where there's many dog walkers. My experience of dogs is that they will keep walking in the direction they're looking. A bike is quiet and will spook a dog, causing the dog to suddenly look at the bike. These two combined will cause the dog to walk, or run, in to your path. The only way around this is to make yourself audible, and if there is no owner present the best way to do that is to skid your tyre a little (the aggressive noise seems to be the only thing dogs pay attention to).

I've only had two incidents with dogs; a Jack Russell that tried to chase me down, and another small dog that tried to outrun me. Neither incident resulted in more than an inconvenience to me.

You can train dogs to deal with bikes but given how little they typically interact it's probably not worth the hassle, especially when all it takes is the bike rider to slow down a bit and make themselves heard (an interaction which only lasts seconds).",0,1409139671,null,0,false,0,ck1ri2v,t3_2epe3j,t1_ck1ri2v,t1_ck1r7zl,null,1427336739,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

&gt;The __TARDIS__   (/ˈtɑːdɪs/; __T__ime __a__nd __R__elative __D__imension __i__n __S__pace)  is a [time machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel) and [spacecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft) in the British [science fiction television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_on_television) programme *[Doctor Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who)* and its associated spin-offs *[The Sarah Jane Adventures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sarah_Jane_Adventures)*, *[Torchwood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchwood)* and more.

&gt;A TARDIS is a product of the advanced technology of the [Time Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Lord), an extraterrestrial civilisation to which the programme's central character, the [Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_(Doctor_Who\)), belongs. A properly maintained and piloted TARDIS can transport its occupants to any point in time and any place in the universe. The interior of a TARDIS is much larger than its exterior, which can blend in with its surroundings using the ship's ""chameleon circuit"". TARDISes also possess a degree of [sentience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience) (which has been expressed in a variety of ways ranging from implied machine personality and [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will) through to the use of a conversant [avatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar)) and provide their users with additional tools and abilities including a [telepathically based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepathy) universal translation system.

&gt;In the series, the Doctor pilots an apparently unreliable, obsolete Type 40, Mark 1   TARDIS. Its chameleon circuit is broken, leaving it stuck in the shape of a 1960s-style London [police box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_box) after a visit to London in 1963.  The Doctor's TARDIS was for most of the series' history said to have been stolen from the Time Lords' home planet, [Gallifrey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallifrey), where it was old, decommissioned and derelict.  However, during the events of ""[The Doctor's Wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doctor%27s_Wife_(Doctor_Who\))"" (2011), the ship's consciousness briefly inhabits a human body named Idris, and she reveals that far from being stolen, she left of her own free will. During this episode, she flirtatiously implies that she ""stole"" the Doctor rather than the other way around, although she does also refer to him as her ""thief"" in the same episode.

---

&gt;[Wimbledon Football Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_F.C.) relocated to [Milton Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Keynes) in September 2003, 16 months after receiving permission to do so from an independent commission appointed by [The Football Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association). The move took the team from south [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), where it had been based since its foundation in 1889, to Milton Keynes, a [new town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_towns_in_the_United_Kingdom) in [Buckinghamshire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckinghamshire), about 56 miles (90 km) to the northwest of the club's traditional home district [Wimbledon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon,_London). Hugely controversial,    the move's legal authorisation directly caused the establishment of [AFC Wimbledon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Wimbledon) by disaffected Wimbledon supporters in June 2002. The relocated club spent most of the [2003–04](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003%E2%80%9304_Football_League) season playing in Milton Keynes under the Wimbledon name, before it rebranded itself as [Milton Keynes Dons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Keynes_Dons_F.C.) (MK Dons) at that season's end.

Moreover, comparing the personal consumption of food with a habit that puts a known harmful substance into the air that *everyone* – not just the vaper – has to breathe in, is disingenuous at best. 

And your unscientifically based assertions about its safety and wishful thinking ('fingers crossed') that it's so much less dangerous than smoking are not at all reassuring. Don't get me wrong, even without further evidence as to it's safety, I would much rather be in a roomful of e-cig vapour than a roomful of tobacco smoke, because I'm fully aware that there are far more noxious and carcinogenic substances in the latter than the former, but why should I, someone who's not an addict, be exposed to either? I'm sorry, but simply saying product A is terrible for your health so you should allow product B, which may not be, simply isn't good enough.

Guide Dogs (well just dogs) cannot judge approaching vehicles or objects from side on. Its not something they understand. Their judgement is therefore not used to cross roads. They are trained to find a pedestrian crossing or sit at a curb enabling their owner to ask a passer by to assist them or they will only be instructed to cross the road when there is nothing in front of them blocking their path. An obstructing vehicle or object is the only thing that would stop them from stepping out into the road, not an approaching vehicle.

Although all this is irrelevant as this article refers to guide dogs being hit on pavements where they really should not be at risk from cyclists.

i) Female genital mutilation.  Something like 30000 women have undergone this procedure and yet there have not been any prosecutions until a few months ago,

ii) Islamic take-over in Birmingham schools.  It was found that fear of being labelled Islamophobic was a good part of the reason this wasn't stopped earlier.

iii) This story in which 1400 children were abused by what it seems were likely Pakistani gangs.  Again the report concluded that fears over appearing prejudiced played a big role in explaining how it had gone on hidden for so long.

So sorry, but I think we do need to question political correctness, or at least PC in its more severe forms.  And no, I'm not calling for a return to the days when it was socially acceptable to use racist slurs or use casual racism in our language.  I'm not looking for the right to call someone a 'paki'.  

But maybe we should question the taboos over 'Islamophobia'.  Maybe we should allow a more honest and free discussion about immigrant cultures and immigration in general without instantly attacking anyone who disagrees with us as racist.

**10:14 am  
Eleanor Barlow**  
Brenda Campbell resumes questioning of Colin Lomas.

She is asking about his account of the majority of fans being ""worse for drink"" and carrying large volumes of alcohol.

He says he spoke to someone who was carrying a carafe of wine.

He said six packs of cans were widespread amongst the crowd, as were large two litre bottles of cider.

He says that was at the 2.30pm mark.

He says he remembers thinking ""how on earth are you going to drink that before you get into the ground?"".

But he says people were not falling down drunk.

He says: ""I saw a lot of people staggering, I saw a lot of people worse for drink. But I'm not saying that anybody was disorderly or the crowd was violent in anyway.""

He was patrolling around Catchbar Lane - at the end of Leppings Lane.
  
  
**10:18 am  
Eleanor Barlow**  
The court is now shown some video footage from about 2.24pm on the day, showing supporters coming down Leppings Lane - at the other end to where Mr Lomas was situated.

A number of fans can be seen walking past the camera, they're walking in the direction of the stadium.

Ms Campbell asks if he saw any fans with six packs of cans in the video.

He says that was a completely different area to where he was situated.

He says: ""I'm sorry, but you're putting in a different location there where I wasn't, where I can't comment on. I can't see any people on your footage at that location carrying alcohol, but I could see them where I was.""

He agrees there were no fans in the video obviously the worse for drink but repeats that he can't comment on that location.
  
  
**10:24 am  
Eleanor Barlow**  
Some photos now shown to the court.

A photo of fans at the top end of Leppings Lane at about 2.03pm shown.

Mr Lomas says there is nobody carrying liquor.

Ms Campbell says the pictures were taken by a South Yorkshire Police photographer, to gather evidence of public disorder and drunkenness.

Ms Campbell says: ""It would have been of interest to him, of course, to photograph these hoards of people carrying large volumes of alcohol, wouldn't it?""

Mr Lomas says there were no incidents of public disorder but says he would imagine so.

We're now shown another photo taken from outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles at about 2.24pm.

Ms Campbell asks if he can see any fans carrying alcohol.

He says it was a different location to where he was. But he says no, he can't.

A third photo of fans shown.

Mr Lomas says he can't see people carrying alcohol.

Ms Campbell says: ""But you are saying this is a different section of fans so therefore they were behaving differently?""

He says: ""I am saying that this was not at my location.""

A fourth photo shown, no one is carrying alcohol.
  
  
**10:31 am  
Eleanor Barlow**  
A photo of fans outside the stadium at 2.10pm is now shown.

Mr Lomas confirms there is no alcohol in this photo.

Ms Campbell says: ""Is it the case, perhaps, that this police photographer there in an evidence-gathering capacity has forgotten his job and is simply photographing members of the public who are out to have a nice day at a football match?""

Mr Lomas says he can't comment on the photographer.

Another photo outside the stadium - these fans appear to have come from the direction of where Mr Lomas was stationed.

No one is obviously worse for drink, Mr Lomas confirms.

Now a photo of the bridge near where Mr Lomas was stationed taken at 2.15pm is shown.

Mr Lomas says the people he saw with alcohol were in the Middlewood Road area near fast food outlets.

Two more photos of fans shown.

The last one is at 2.12pm and shows fans who have come from the direction of Mr Lomas's location.

Ms Campbell says: ""Where in this photograph are the people with the large quantities of alcohol that were coming from your position?""

He says he has no idea.

Ms Campbell says this photo was taken at a time when Mr Lomas says the majority of fans were walking away from the stadium.

She says the majority of people in this photo are walking towards the stadium.

Mr Lomas says he was on Middlewood Road and can't comment on fans on the bridge at the bottom of Leppings Lane.
  
  
**10:36 am  
Eleanor Barlow**  
Ms Campbell suggests Mr Lomas is ""welded"" to his account of fans worse for alcohol, carrying drink and ticketless.

Ms Campbell asks about ticketless fans.

She quotes what Mr Lomas said yesterday: ""I saw a lot of people without tickets.""

He clarifies that he saw a lot of people asking for ticket.

Ms Campbell says that is different.

He says: ""I've never tried to intimate that I could tell by looking at somebody whether they had a ticket or not.""

She now quotes his comment from yesterday: ""I saw a lot of people gathering outside of the turnstiles who obviously didn't have a ticket, otherwise they wouldn't have been sat there.""

He says it was an assumption on his part because he couldn't see the reason why he would sit or stand there.

Ms Campbell asks if he could think of any other reason why they might wait there.

She asks about arranging to meet friends outside the stadium, or waiting for a child to go to the shop to get sweets, or waiting while the crowd dies down.

He admits they are all good reasons.
  
  
**10:39 am  
Eleanor Barlow**  
Ms Campbell says Mr Lomas then made the assumption that when he went to the turnstiles and there was no one there - the 'ticketless' fans must have gone in the ground.

Some more video footage now shown from Leppings Lane at 2.37pm.

She asks if the group of men in the still of the footage are the people Mr Lomas referred to as ticketless.

He says he wouldn't know.

The footage is now played to court.

Ms Campbell says: ""Can you tell by looking at anyone in that crowd whether they have a ticket?""

He says absolutely not.

He agrees that no one in the crowd outside the turnstiles was holding large volumes of alcohol.

true,FooFighterJL,eng-yorkshire,Yorkshire,"&gt;Can I just ask however how can a law system be fair if it has not kept up with current affairs and how crimes are committed?.You say the sytem is behind the times , why is this so .

There is no single answer for this. Each case has its own factors that make it unique. Sometimes its poor foresight of legislatures. Other times its completely out of the blue cases that could have not been predicted. Other times its because of problems with jurisdiction (this is especially true with Trans-national companies). 

&gt;You talk about the western legal system being the best in the world.

Correct.

&gt;However , for exame war crimes , why have the majority of high profile war crime tribunals being against leadrrs who have oppossed western governance. Former African leaders , Milosovic etc .Why have only these being convicted , and not Western backed leaders.For example the West does not have its hands clean , for example the Iraq war and other western backed coups.

I think it would be unfair to pin this on failings in the western judicial system. When I refer to the western judicial system I am referring to the principals it was founded on. The judicial-philosophy. I think it is a near perfect philosophy that has been eroded by other factors that have risen over the centuries. 

The Iraq War is one of the dirtiest cases in history. I would not put the actions of Blair and Bush on the same shelf as some of the people who have been convicted by International Courts. Not even close. You simply cannot compare genocidal maniacs like  Milošević to Bush and Blair. It is no way near as clear cut.

I would be hesitant to talk about Iraq in too much detail but the main reason a prosecution has not been brought against Bush/Blair in the same way a prosecution was brought against your mentioned dictators is simply 'rules of war'. Who was the target in  Milošević's crimes? Civilians. Who was the target in the Iraq War? A dictator who, after failing in a 1990 attempt, made it clear that once he had acquired sufficient capabilities, would re-take Kuwait and finish his murderous campaign against the persecuted Kurdish people.

You simply can't put those two on the same legal shelf. One was an implicit attempt to wipe out a group of civilians, the other was the attempt to remove a dictator who had a war crime list just as extensive as  Milošević. 

&gt; but to me the law system does sound biased

I'll list a few alternatives:

1. You can only have state-funded lawyers for your defense. RESULT: People are unfairly prosecuted because the defense lawyers are funded by the same body as the ones prosecuting leading to interior-motives and thus unfair prosecutions. 

2. Set a cap on how much people can spend in defense. RESULT: given the huge variety of cases, from cheap ones to super-expensive corporate ones, the vast majority of cases will not be affected by a centered cap and the best defense lawyers will still be attracted to the top of that cap since their money is dictated by how many cases they take and not so much as how much they earn per case + numerous other problems. 

In my honest opinion I think the best way combat this problem is to sub-contract the Prosecution to private defense lawyers. It will cost the government more but it means that the defense lawyers of the accused are getting a fair match against lawyers who are worth their weight. 

The flip-side of this, however, is the common man you're trying to defend will also be subject to this more vigorous Prosecution and will reduce their likelihood of being found not-guilty. But does that matter to you? Are you just interested in seeing more common people get off and fewer wealthy get off? Or are you interested in the genuine truth? Whether a person is *truly* guilty or not? If it is the latter, then I think the system I just suggested is the best option because it ensures the highest standard of legal practice possible.

true,Fineus,eng-westmidlands,"Birmingham, formerly a Southern Pansy","&gt; Relatively speaking, cycling is entirely safe.

Literally speaking, cyclists collided with a noticeable number of guide dogs / owners in London. I don't know if cycling can truly be considered ""safe"" and ignoring the issues will not make them go away. 

&gt; I disagree that cyclists are always the victim. There are plenty of shite cyclists out there. But the consequences of being a shite cyclist are nothing compared to the consequences of being a shite driver.

True - but this is a tired rhetoric. Why can't cyclists be held accountable for their actions? Why should motorists always be factored in as an attempt to deflect and mitigate the fault of cyclists?

&gt; I just don't understand why so much emphasis and thought is placed on the 'problem' of pavement cyclists etc when less than one person a year is killed by them. 

I'd be interested to see injury statistics factored in - as well as the anti-social aspect. We live in a society that calls the police out on young people making a disturbance in the street after all - even if they're not directly attacking the neighbouring houses, it'll still be taken seriously. 

Given cyclists expect to be taken seriously when cars pass dangerously close to them (but don't hit) - isn't it reasonable to hold cyclists up to the same standards of not passing dangerously close to people on pavements they shouldn't be on? 

&gt; So why do people bitch and moan about cyclists on the pavement, but not motorists on the pavements?

Cyclists are far more common and still cause harm to those they hit – even though they thankfully don’t kill people. I’d dread to think what life would be like if we only acknowledged a threat from things that killed – ignoring things that only injure, hurt, scare etc. 

At the end of the day – why should pedestrians (who certainly can’t use the road) have to endure cyclists who aren’t all slow, considerate and safe? They shouldn’t. There’s no good reason. 

Only arrogant cyclists would think differently. Everyone’s safety is important – we should all be free to move around without fear of injury or death. Not just motorists. Not just cyclists. Everyone. 

So campaign for better infrastructure – that’s fantastic and an idea I support – but don’t try and excuse poor cycling on pavements that evidently HAS hit people and DOES cause fear and injury.

One of the reasons I like this place is that your disagreements are instructive, not destructive. I'm not that impressed by Harry, for example - 4 wins in 29 premier league games is pretty poor. But I completely acknowledge that he worked a minor miracle in getting us through last year's playoffs and that we'll be worse off if we panic and sack him. I entirely agree with your expectation for this year - try to stay up - but that made me particularly disappointed during and after the Spurs game. There was a kind of arrogance to the club when we got relegated last time, as though our squad was too good to go down, and I felt that again at White Hart Lane. That and the tactics/team-selection was a disaster. We need to have a rethink and make changes now, not later - but that doesn't mean throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

Don't get me wrong, I think forums like WATRBs has their place, people need somewhere to blow off steam and it's better they do it online than in the real world.

true,G_Morgan,cnty-wales,Wales,"The problem with the term ""patriarchy"" is it massively simplifies an incredibly complex system and presents it in a divisive manner that is an outright accusation against an entire gender. The fact that everywhere this term pops up you need to spend an hour explaining that it isn't what the term immediately invokes is a huge canary.

If we accept this term for a moment we can draw at least two reasonable statements about it:

1. There are a large number of women, maybe even a majority, that defend the patriarchy or parts thereof. For instance loads of women who'd defend the privileged position they have in child custody battles. That kind of reinforcement of gender roles is as much part of the patriarchy as glass ceilings yet find me a consensus from women that it should be fixed.

2. The system hurts men as well as women, though in different ways. For women is it reduced power. For men it is being burden by bullshit like not complaining about cancer or mental issues or whatever.

Given that the system hurts both genders and is actually supported by a majority of both genders it is rather disingenuous to label it in such a way. Particularly because it loses you support before you even start the conversation. The whole usage of the term starts a gender war with the opening play.

The worse thing about the intentional use of divisive language from the feminist camp is it plays into all the old mistakes nearly every progressive movement ends up making. By pitting the people suffering to a greater or lesser degree against each other rather than focusing on the real cause of the issues.

A huge part of the supposed patriarchy system is actually capitalists looking to keep women in a secondary position in the work force so at least 50% can be relied upon to not vanish to look after children. Instead of presenting the issue as parents against the system and the minority who pushes to keep women in the kitchen (though part time) and men in work we end up with this nonsense of blaming the entire male gender for the problem.",0,1409144295,null,0,1409144587,0,ck1stz6,t3_2epcv8,t1_ck1stz6,t1_ck1qlp8,null,1427336046,4,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,4

He was loaned out to West Brom, smashed up teams and was again loaned out to Everton while our Strikers were performing poorly.

Let me remind you the Everton loan was Lukaku's decision. Mourinho literally has said that out loud in an interview. I don't have to agree with you but at the VERY least know what you're talking about. He would have gotten game time if he stayed as you said 'strikers were preforming poorly'. The West Brom loan was an easy call. He obviously hadn't shown enough to be a big time player.

&gt;How would you feel after two Years you're not chosen and then in the 3rd year again you won't be chosen for most of the Season as Diego will start ahead in the lonely striker Position?

He is a 21 year old kid. He doesn't have any European experience. How the FUCK can you tell me with a straight face that he should expect to waltz into the number 1 spot? If he stays instead of pushing a move to Everton last season and proves himself? Sure. What did he do? He ran off to Everton. Sure it was because he wanted to make the Belgium squad but then he bitches and makes a move when we buy a striker with loads more experience at top teams AND CL experience? There is no way in fuck we should have trusted Lukaku with the first spot and EVERYONE knows it.

&gt;which means minutes are VERY limited and with Drogba on board and Torres potentially still with us, that's not a great place to be.

'Very limited'? He would have gotten 15-30 starts this year at one of the best teams in the world. Then add another 10-20 sub appearances. Is that what we call limited now? You're shitting me right?

&gt;He's a Professional, he wants to play week after week at the highest Level, and if you're denied that for 3 Seasons, I'd also leave as well, that's three years of his life limited by the club.

He could have had his chance these past two seasons. Before that he wasn't ready for the team at 18/19 and you're fucking deluded if you think he deserved a chance at that. (Remember he was there for the champions league win. He obviously wasn't good enough for the club that year).

&gt;He was with us, we didn't use him, that's it.

No. That's not it. He went on Loan one year then Mourinho wanted to bring him back. Lukaku ran away like a little bitch who didn't want to fight for his spot. When he came back he was pissed we bought a striker who has everything he doesn't so he ran away AGAIN like a little bitch. THAT is all that happened.

&gt;It's nice being a fan without bias, it's why I'm so disliked on here.

He needs to play a blinder or lose his position to Allen long term or potentially Lallana when he's back. 

I'm quite worried about the fact that the diamond may throw Balotelli into the team, and we don't know how much he'll track back. That's one of the more essential things about the formation. With strikers tracking back, the midfield is strong.

There is an intrinsic[1] value of the share (or unit) which may go up and down. The gain or loss is entirely paper until you liquidate it (i.e. sell it and turn it into cash). This represents what people believe the encapsulated assets are worth.

There are also ways that those companies attempt to return value to the shareholder, aside from growing the company and making the share more valuable: principally dividends and share buy-backs. How the money paid to you via a dividend is returned to you is entirely up to you. For instance, if you select an [accumulation fund versus an income fund](http://monevator.com/income-units-versus-accumulation-units-difference/), it will automatically reinvest any returns and buy more stock. 

Most brokers also allow you to choose to reinvest any dividends paid into your account from any direct investments for a small fee (e.g. automatically use any dividends from my investments in Morrisons to buy more Morrisons shares...).

So are a provable majority of motorists dangerous justice-pass making maniacs? Any stats to back that up? 

Also I doubt you have any statistics on the speed of pavement mounted cyclists or their braking habits? 

&gt; I did not make any generalisations about motorists in my comment, so I'm not sure how this is relevant.

You made generalisations about cyclists - I provided a counterpoint that as you said 'a lot of cyclists who use the pavement do so at moderate speeds' I can also say ' a lot of motorists who use the road do not make justice passes of cyclists'. 

If you're accepting your point then you must accept mine - both hold the same weight, justification and logic behind them. 

&gt; Yet you then claim that because a few people are dicks, ""you can't expect anything from us.""

You've misunderstood me - I mean in terms of sympathy. Cyclists who post here about errant motorists expect sympathy and agreement but try and argue when it's pointed out that cyclists also misuse the road, break the law and scare endanger others. 

If it's impossible to acknowledge that, don't expect us pedestrians to go the extra yard towards sympathising. 

As long as I'm nearly being hit by bikes who jump red lights and endanger pedestrians - I *will blame them*. I have no reason not to. I know it would be convenient if I joined the fight and argued for better infrastructure and as a cyclist I actually agree that's necessary. 

But as a pedestrian - stop telling me to excuse cyclists for nearly hitting me because of bad infrastructure. 

Or else I'll just tell cyclists who are angry at near-pass motorists to blame infrastructure, not motorists... but funnily enough that rarely happens and it's always the motorists fault.

Much like you'd want to pick up a few good episodes of the modern series to get a feel for it, for the classic series you'll want to see a few *serials* to get a solid look.  I personally went for stories that introduced specific characters and elements, so I'd suggest starting with Genesis of the Daleks (Fourth Doctor story on their origin).  It's a Classic era story with a lot of elements that made it through to the revived series.  

Going backward, maybe check out The Time Warrior (Third Doctor, introduction of Sarah Jane Smith), The Three Doctors (first crossover episode), Tomb of the Cybermen (Second, cited as an influence on Matt Smith's Doctor), The Tenth Planet (First, featuring the first regeneration and the Cybermen), and The Daleks (First, their first appearance).  Not necessarily in that order, but these can give you a feel for each Doctor's era on the show.

Personally I saw some of the introductions mentioned above and then started watching things in order at The War Games (Second-&gt;Third regeneration) so I could avoid the whole ""lost episodes"" thing.

If people will always give the same total amount to charity, any increase in the money a charity spends on fundraising or top executive pay is only increasing the money *their* charity makes - but that money is effectively just coming from other charities!

It therefore follows that as the proportion of their funds spent on actual charitable causes decreases, we are just taking away the total amount of money we spend on charitable causes.

In general, the writers just need to make the daleks engaging again.  They have allowed them to grow stale and tired.  The solution, as far as I'm concerned, is to let them rest for a series or two and then bring them back with an episode that utilizes the things that made them popular in the first place: their screaming voices, their utter mercilessness, their cruelty, and the violence that always used to be guaranteed in ""Dalek Episodes"".  From there, what they only need to do is create a story that will feature these traits well, while still being interesting.  It's easier said than done, but it's still very doable.

Oh, and the episode should have actual daleks as the villains.  Not Davros, and certainly not those humanoids with eyestalks in their foreheads.  I would even advise against using the Dalek Emperor because the daleks always seem to be more effective villains when there are only a few onscreen at a time, which would be harder to pull off if a Dalek Empire were involved.  This is because whenever there are a lot of daleks on screen, a few inevitably end up getting destroyed, which doesn't do good things for their image.

He's absolutely incredible when we need to control a game and slow things down a bit though.

I would love to see Gerrard/Hendo/Coutinho in the middle with Sterling as the tip of the diamond and then Balotelli/Sturridge up top. It might be asking a little too much of our fullbacks though as Lamela and Chadli are looking dangerous. Hard to say but we looked absolutely lethal playing this shape last season and I really think signing s forward of Balo profile was a statement that we want to carry on with it.

It would be neat to see BR experiment with a 4-2-2-2 like what City as at some point too (not against Spurs but in an early cup match perhaps) using Can/Hendo as the central pair with any 2 of Markovic/Lallana/Sterling/Coutinho/Suso playing as the attacking midfield pair and then any 2 of our forwards (though ideally Balotelli and Sturridge of course).

It was just a complete lack of concentration which fortunately hasn't been a hallmark of his game so far.

What's more concerning for me is that his weaknesses are things that are quite hard to train: the GK coach lofting in balls from the wing is no substitute for the melee that happens in the box from a corner. You *could* recreate that situation in training but that would mean Rodgers dedicating a massive part of his session to something that only benefits one player, in one part of their game. Clearly he thinks there are more productive things to be doing. Which is also why we're a bit shit in defence: he's got a finite time on the training pitch and he thinks working on offensive play will get us more points than working on defensive play.
