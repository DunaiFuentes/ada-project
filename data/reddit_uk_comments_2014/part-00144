Your 2nd point for me is most important. you see it all the time. Torres, Adam, Benzema, Berbatov when he went to utd, Giovanni who played for Hull back in 09, players who have teams built around them and fall apart when they move to a 'bigger' club where they have to work as a unit instead of thriving on the pressure of being the focal point of a team. Its a sign of a great player when a big player at a big club can go to another big club and succeed in the way he did at his previous club. Ronaldo, Bale, Modric, Aguero, etc.

Nah we'll leave the DVD's to you mate.

&gt;my point was that the only thing that Arsenal proved this year was that they were better than Spurs and could come from behind to squeak past Hull.

Only an asinine who doesn't know what he's talking about would say that.

Those aren't the only 2 good moments in Arsenal's season.

Arsenal beat Spurs, Liverpool and Everton on the route to the final. 2 of which convincingly. Arsenal beat Napoli and Liverpool (Premier League) convincingly at home when we had Ramsey/Ozil (and Arteta who people underrate). We also beat Borussia Dortmund at the Westfalldenstadion. We went games of 8 straight wins. We struggled without Ozil, Ramsey, Walcott, Wilshere all at once though.

&gt;The comment that OP posted shows that your entire delusional fan base fails to realize that ""miles better"" than Spurs is still miles from top of the league

We were 7 points off first with a terrible striker and 3 of our best players injured for at least 2 months of the season. We won't win it next year either but we're definitely not a million miles away at all. 

&gt;Wilshire was right to get on the biggest stage of his career and have a go at Spurs because Arsenal is just another domestic cup team fighting to make fourth in the league.

Wilshere*. Arsenal are on a completely different level to Spurs and have far bigger aspirations. We're in a process of steady improvement and have had an improving points tally since 2010. Top 4 is the minimum expectations and for Spurs that is like winning the league. Stop trying to associate yourselves with us because we are completely different.

I was going to put a whole list of comments up as well but THE VERY FIRST comment I came across was so odiously hateful, I thought it was enough.

Father Richard, London, United Kingdom, 4 days ago
I can't wait to watch Scotland slide into the economic abyss once they go free, they have an ageing population, they are completely reliant on state sector employment and most of rural Scotland relies so heavily on subsidies - you will be outside the UK, Spain will never allow to into the Euro as that will set a precedent for Catalonia and the Basques - the so called oil you people go on about? Well as we sit here the inhabitants of Orkney and Shetland - who do not regard themselves as Scottish will be insisting on their own referendum to have the same status as the Isle of Man, the oil is in fact Shetland property officially. Oh and one more thing, if you want trident moving south too, that means you are completely vulnerable to attack and outside the US protection the whole of the UK currently has and believe me, there are a lot of people in the World who hold a grudge against the UK!

Your justification appears to be based on only paying for what you watch. It doesn't work like that.

&gt;It's a little more subversive with the BBC because it isn't independent any longer, and yet everybody believes everything it says, because of its protected status.

If anything, they go too far in trying to be independent - attacking politicians in interviews for no reason, for example. They're far less a mouthpiece of the government than Sky is for Murdoch.

&gt;It's not a loop hole: It's law.

And so is tax avoidance. So I guess that's alright, then (since you don't want to address the moral issue). If someone was talking on their mobile whilst driving before it was outlawed, would you accept their running you over due to not paying attention as OK, because they weren't breaking the law? You don't seem to realise how thin your justifications are.

&gt; I and most others abide by it.

'Most others' pay for it without considering if they can get away with not doing so, because they recognise it isn't designed to revolve purely around them, just like the NHS or the fire service.

&gt;What it comes down to is you disagreeing with a lifestyle choice

You're repeating what you said before without really addressing my illustrations as to why those excuses don't work.

&gt;but don't pretend the law is on your side, because it isn't

Not sure where I said that. I've actually pointed out twice how 'I'm not breaking the law' isn't good enough on its' own.

&gt;If you think the law should be changed, petition government.

Why? Because a tiny minority think they're being clever in avoiding £12 a month?

&gt; You think the BBC should be protected, and it should be a public service.

Er...it is protected, and it *is* a public service.

&gt;I disagree, it should be reduced to the bare objective necessities, leaving everything else to be purchased by the individual.

If you don't like it, petition government - or look into why the overwhelming majority don't see it that way.

&gt; I've voted with my wallet by cutting out the middle man (BBC), and paying the producers of quality content as directly as possible.

Sure, so why not vote with your wallet with regards to the NHS or the fire service? I mean, you don't use them, right?

&gt; Polygraphy has little evidence to support its use.    Despite claims of 90% validity by polygraph advocates,  the [National Research Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Research_Council) has found no evidence of effectiveness.  The utility among sex offenders is also poor  with insufficient evidence to support accuracy or improved outcomes in this population. 

&gt;Even using the high estimates of polygraph's accuracy a significant number of subjects will appear to be lying, and would unfairly suffer the consequences of ""failing"" the polygraph. In the 1998 [Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) case, *[United States v. Scheffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Scheffer)*, the majority stated that ""There is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable"" and ""Unlike other expert witnesses who testify about factual matters outside the jurors' knowledge, such as the analysis of fingerprints, ballistics, or DNA found at a crime scene, a polygraph expert can supply the jury only with another opinion...""  In 2005 the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals stated that “polygraphy did not enjoy general acceptance from the scientific community”.  In 2001 William Iacono, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience concluded that

It is no longer sufficient to say ""we've suspended the search""; you have to show your work. Times, lat/long, details. We're not stupid any more--we can make a meaningful contribution. No matter how good or how expert, if you do not share the data upon which your conclusions are based, you cannot expect us to trust your conclusions on a technical matter. Mistakes happen, systematic errors creep in, the significance of details may be overlooked.

Oooo edgy.

&gt;You actually think the BBC in its current form is as important as the NHS or Fire service.

Again, where did I say that? You'd better start quoting, because you're reading what-you-want into my replies,and doing so this time has made the rest of your response an exercise in pointless typing. Especially when you're now down to pick-and-choosing what to answer.

It's almost as if you're not the first.

EDIT: (Now you've finished)

&gt;It does seem to upset you, but you do nothing about it.

I don't have to, because the vast majority don't agree with your opinion. Fortunately.

&gt;You're being moronic now. Moral issue? How about forcing somebody to pay for something they do not use?

You mean like other public services?

&gt;Presumably you think people with cars declared off-road should also pay for MOT, Insurance and VED? I mean it's the moral thing to do isn't it?

You're the one assuming you can defend exploiting a loophole.

&gt;I actually feel sorry for you that TV is as important to you as actually public service.

Oh dear, once again you're sticking to stuff I haven't said. And it *is* a public service. Your weak self-justifications don't change that.

&gt; Libraries are shutting down around the country, schools and teachers are pressed to perform with less money, but I suppose that barely registers with you.

I work for a London council. Guess again.

&gt;Actually, that's not fair. You're not a poor deluded sod because you think the BBC is important

Sure, everyone else thinks like you do.

&gt; you're a poor deluded sod because you refuse to see the issue in anything but black or white

There's no need to see it any other way - that doesn't change just because you can't think of a better excuse that coming up with your own definition of what a public service is.

&gt; from anybody else's perspective

Sure, because you're 'anybody else'. It's becoming apparent how much of your posts involve using I-I-I as justification.

&gt;and think you can guilt people into caring for your morals.

That's not what I'm doing though - I'm demonstrating what happens when some fool decides to boast about using a loophole to not pay for what virtually everyone else does. And well done for reducing what the vast majority agree with down to 'my' morals.

I'll toe the line harder next time, there's a right answer in these threads. I don't understand how people can bitch and whine about the club's youth policy in one thread, and show zero bravery in these hypothetical ""make a squad"" threads.

- Needs to work on control of his box in terms of coming out and claiming long balls, and crosses.

What moral points? You think a man should pay for something when he has no legal need to. There's nothing moral about that, that's just straight up retarded.

Sure, because legal/ moral are the same thing, and I have given no examples at all as to how that doesn't work.

&gt;If we find it reprehensible enough, we should vote for politicians who will change the law. But we won't.

Most people don't have to, because they pay for the benefit of everyone else. Unlike you.

&gt;Take Garry Barlow, recently honoured, also tax avoider. Do I give two shits about him or his money? No. Because I'm not an addled 5 year old that think the world is run by what is right and what is wrong.

Despite the money he didn't pay potentially going to the libraries, etc. that you were so worried about a minute ago. I can see you've given this a lot of consideration.

&gt;I'm pretty sure German citizens thought it moral to inform police of their Jewish neighbours.

Godwin bonus.

&gt;Do you see why we need to keep morals out of the law

No. At least, not when they're used to avoid obvious moral choices - Like Taxes. And the TV License. I can certainly see why *you* would want them kept separate. 

&gt;and out of adult conversation?

You haven't presented an adult conversation, more like a collection of dog-ate-my-homework level excuses.

You mean the bits you repeatedly insisted I said that I didn't?

&gt;that you can get away thinking people who obey the law but make different choice to you must be using some tricky loophole

That's exactly what you're doing.

&gt;and therefore must be criminals

No, just greedy/ self-serving.

&gt;and apologise to hard working proles like yourself who pay for all the dross we watch, even if you don't.

You mean instead of bragging on a public board about how I can hide behind loopholes in order to avoid paying for something that everyone else does? 

&gt;Write what you want, It's clear you can't be compromised with. 

Sure, it's so *inconvenient* when someone highlights just how weak your logic is. Especially when you jump to attack instead of addressing the core problem with it, almost as if you know where it will lead.

Those of us who have seen areas change for the worse, have seen the damage done by uncontrolled mass immigration, we're the people talking about it.

To all the left wingers, they've not seen it. To them, immigration means a nice Bulgarian family moving in next door, or a lovely curry house down the road.

What they don't understand is that we still want all that, and that's why we support a points based immigration system.

They don't see the negatives, they don't see the community tensions, they don't see the hundreds of thousands of people who not only don't want to integrate, but who actually hate British culture and our way of life  .. and so they think we must be racists to bring this up.

Every time this is brought up they always say ""well not every immigrant is like that!"", as if we don't know that. The point we're making is that a **points based immigration system** would solve these problems.

Pakistani engineers, Indian surgeons, Nigerian business owners, Romanian restaurateurs, American dentists, Canadian pilots, Ugandan charity workers.. We want all that.

We're happy to welcome immigrants who would contribute to the country at a sustainable rate of 30,000 or so a year.

We don't want population growth so extreme that we have senior politicians seriously considering bricking over the green belt to build housing estates..

Our biggest problem was the starting XI shipping goals.  The form of our fullbacks and centrebacks was not at the quality that it should be from a side challenging for the title.  A better first XI is more important than a better bench.

Texeira is already 21, if not now, when?  

I certainly don't want Sterling dropped to the bench, he was our best player the last 6 weeks.

Coutinho, maybe.  His form was inconsistent and not as good as his first 6 months.  Even so, its not a priority for me, because we can play Gerrard-Hendo-Allen - Sterling-Suarez-Sturridge and still have Coutinho  and Borini on the bench.

Left footed players generally only play on the left because of the scarcity of left-footers.  There are many technical aspects of defending that have to be worked on diligently until everything is fluid and natural.  Unlike with wingers/attackers, who can easily switch sides of the field with a little work, they don't have to relearn vital mechanics in order to be effective because they can face up and use either foot.  Center backs are generally dropping back on their favored shoulder and have to work on positioning their body to play the ball out of the back once they take possession.  Passing angles are completely thrown off if a player can't comfortably adjust or accurately play with his right.  The player also has to be a lot more comfortable leading tackles with their weak foot in order to not give away a clear path through the center of the pitch.",0,1400687361,null,0,1400772276,0,chnkepd,t3_263prh,t1_chnkepd,t1_chng0yf,null,1433893361,1,false,LiverpoolFC,t5_2qn0o,1

true,portaccio,stmirren,,"In Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen I believe it is rare to find Old Firm fans. However, in the west of Scotland there are loads of Old Firm fans outside of Glasgow. Paisley is certainly full of them, but it's just seven miles from Glasgow. St Mirren, Morton, Motherwell, Airdrie, Hamilton, Albion Rovers, Dumbarton, Kilmarnock and more suffer from their local populations being drawn away by the Gruesome Twosome. 

In some ways it's a population density issue. Scotland's population is largely focused on the central belt, meaning this is where most clubs were formed. The trouble is that the clubs in the west are within commuting distance of two massive clubs and struggle to get a unified community behind them. It's a self-perpetuating, vicious circle as well. The Old Firm are massive because they draw support from outside Glasgow, and draw support from outside Glasgow because they're massive. 

Also, there is the religious/ethnic/political issue to consider. Celtic are seen as representative of those descended from Irish Catholic immigrants, so such people in places like Motherwell and Paisley may well see Celtic as representative of their background in a way that the local club isn't. Rangers are the other side of the coin, obviously. I don't really want to get bogged down in all that nonsense, though, and there has been plenty written about that whole can of worms. But I don't think there is any doubt that the two clubs came to be so widely supported because of what they represent in that sense. The team you support often gets passed down, so by the 21st century most Old Firm fans just see it as a footballing rivalry (not all, sadly) but the early growth in the support was in part due to this.

Finally, there is the fact that those who don't have a family link to a club will choose one for themselves. They'll go along with their mates, the bulk of which will be Old Firm fans, or they'll go with a club who are on TV frequently, again the Old Firm.

A lot of thistle fans start supporting them partly as a rejection of the bigotry that accompanies the old firm, though to be fair it isn't as bad as it used to be. 

Personally I prefer supporting a smaller team. The thrill of avoiding relegation can be as exciting as the thrill of getting promoted. Almost getting relegated to the second division and coming back form the brink of insolvency really makes you appreciate getting to play in the premiership and watching half decent football again.

Do you mean the political will that drives it and orders it? The martial organization that defines it? Or the individual men and women that form it?

It's possible that you hate war and death. I think most of us do. But I don't hate the people that serve ... they're like anyone else. They're flawed human beings. Some good, some not, most falling somewhere in the middle. To assume they're all murders, or that they just want to kill, is almost shocking to me. I don't think that's what you're saying, but some say that.

I served. I served alongside electricians, nurses and EMTs, firefighters, mechanics, carpenters, navigators, radio operators, electronics wizards -- you get the idea. We're just like anyone else, we just wear a different uniform and get paid a lot less.

If you dislike war, as I do, keep in mind that the military is a tool. How it's used is up to the people that are elected to wield it. That can mean building hospitals and schools in poor countries, rescuing people from natural disasters, or ... it can be used destructively.

Let me ask you this: if the military as an entity vanished overnight, would war and murder and all the chaos wrought by hatred, misunderstanding and nationalism vanish with it?

true,HMFCalltheway,hearts,,"&gt; In Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen I believe it is rare to find Old Firm fans. 

Well in my experience it's certainly not rare to find OF fans in Edinburgh. It's probably more likely football fans will follow the local teams but there are still plenty of supporters of the Glasgow teams.

I'd say within the city proper there are more Hearts and Hibs fans but in the surrounding area (suburbs and neighbouring towns where you'd maybe expect people to support the local pro sides) Old firm fans are there in numbers. Many towns East of Edinburgh e.g. Dalkeith and Musselburgh could very likely have as many supporters of these teams as the Edinburgh sides. Further afield into Livingston and up in Fife where there are a number of smaller teams there will be many towns where the majority of people support Rangers or Celtic (though the Edinburgh teams will take away a fair few fans as well). 

Much of this is due to a large number of people moving through from the west (esp. to council estates and new towns after the Glasgow slums were cleared) with a fair number of glory hunters as well e.g. my dad used to support Celtic due to the Lisbon Lions while when I was at primary school in the late 90's - early 00's all my friends identified as Rangers fans.

true,Seismica,cnty-uk,Teesside,"&gt; Do people really believe this? You can't do anything meaningful with your life if you don't do a job for someone else?

Yes to some extent. There are plenty of things I want to do in my time that I simply don't have the means to do. For instance I would love to buy an old car and fix it up just for something to do with my time, but the first problem is I have no money to buy a car. Second problem is, I have nowhere to store it, and no money for a storage unit/garage to store and work on it. Thirdly, if I wanted to work on that as a serious project I would need a better set of tools. I'd love to work on this as a hobby, but right now i'm limited to doing things within my means.

Obviously I need to make a living though, so perhaps there is ways of doing so without working for other people. Instead of trying to work for somebody else I could start my own business. Great, but I have no startup capital, so that eliminates a lot of options already. I do have a valuable set of skills, I could sell those and start an Engineering consultancy. However, without the experience, the contacts and the reputation I wouldn't be able to get any clients. I could fix computers for a living, but that is a very difficult market to break into. There are so many struggling independant computer repair shops out there, because the market is simply oversatured. It doesn't help that if one person within a family realises you can simply google problems and fix them yourself, that business dries up.

I'll also add that anybody who has been unemployed for a great length of time may know what I'm talking about in regards to happiness. By far the biggest impact of unemployment is on your mental health and wellbeing, which I would go into further but it's very difficult to explain properly. All I know is that I'm happier when i'm working, and that i'm varying levels of miserable when i'm not.
 
&gt; If everyone thinks like this, why don't we just increase the retirement age to 90 or abolish it completely and just give old people the same JSA or disability benefits as young people who don't work?

Eh? So you disagree that work can be beneficial non-financially?

The retirement age debate is a completely seperate issue, I don't even know why you brought that up. At the end of the day you work to make a living, I was just highlighting that there is more to being in work than just money.

&gt; I work because I have to to be able to eat. If I was given enough for shelter, food and basic utilities, I'd be out of my callcentre job in a second to **do something more meaningful than sitting talking on the phone all day**.

true,wizard710,null,null,"As someone who is not particularly interested in Soccer this is how it seems:

&gt;Firstly, imagine every time within a day that football is mentioned by someone else. Secondly, replace it with something that you don't want to hear about every day. Say... Archaeology. Then, think carefully about how an average day would pan out.

&gt;So, you awaken to the clock radio. It's 7AM. Just as you awaken, it's time for the news and archaeology already. Not news and other historical investigations, like library restorations or museum openings (unless there's another event happening), but just the news and archaelogy. Malaysian plane is still missing. Pistorius is still on trial. New dig announced in Giza. Ancient Mayan temple discovered. Exciting stuff.

&gt;Time for a bite to eat over the morning TV. More news. More archaeology. Yes, you are aware of what is up with the missing plane. Fine. Now the archaeology in video format. Video of people dusting off some skulls and bits of pottery. All well and good, but archaeology isn't your thing. It would be nice to hear about something else. 

&gt;Even when it isn't archaeology season, the media follow noted archaeologists. They drive fast cars, date beautiful women, advertise fragrances, and sometimes they go to nightclubs and act in the worst possible way. Scandals erupt as the tabloids follow these new celebrities when they're not searching the past for answers. It is entirely possible you can recite the names of certain researchers, even if you don't pay attention to archaeology. You don't know what transfer season is, but you know that someone was transferred to a dig in Peru for a sum of money that could fund the London Underground for two whole days.

&gt;Out of the car at 8:55 and into work. What are the colleagues talking about, I wonder? Oh, Jones dropped a 3,890 year old pot and smashed it? What a useless wanker! Someone should do something unpleasant to him. And don't even ask about the unfortunate incident in Athens two years ago - you'll be there all day! Breaking a pillar like that! We don't talk about that here, mate. What? You don't want to discuss the finer points of the prevalence of phallic imagery in Pompeii? Is there something wrong with you?

&gt;The drive home from work. Every thirty minutes, no matter the station, someone mentions the archaeology. Best sit in silence. Drive past a huge billboard with a black and white picture of a rakishly handsome archaeologist draped over an impossibly beautiful woman. He's winking at you. Trowel in his left hand, supermodel in the right. Jurassic, by Calvin Klein.

&gt;And now the pub. A nice pub with a beer garden. Posters in the windows. LIVE EXCAVATION AT THE VALLEY OF THE KINGS! All of it on a huge TV with the volume up too loud. Drunken people yelling at the screen. ""SEND IT FOR CARBON DATING, YOU USELESS ***K!"" ""WHAT ARE YOU ON, MATE? DUST THE ANCIENT MEDALLION GENTLY! SMELTING METHODS OF THE TIME PRODUCED VERY SOFT AND IMPURE METALS EASILY PRONE TO DISFIGURATION!"" All this from two men out of a crowd of twenty. One lousy drunken idiot and his chum ruin the image of other archaeology fans. Carbon dating report from the lab updates on TV, read by a man employed because they've been following the beautiful science since they were a boy. The drunk chimes in again. ""WHAT PHARAOH'S REIGN DID YOU SAY? DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS SAYS ABOUT THE UNDERPINNINGS OF OUR THEORY OF AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF 4TH BC EGYPT? GET IN, MATE!"" A cheer cascades through the building and you can only wonder why.

&gt;Best go home and avoid anyone who might be drinking and singing. You once met a disagreeable chap who threatened to beat you up because you didn't watch the archaeology. ""Not a late paleolithic era supporter are you? Think you're better than me? I'll have you, you scrawny tw*t!""

&gt;To bed. To repeat the cycle tomorrow. The inescapable, inevitability that wherever you go, someone, somewhere, is just dying to talk to you about the archaeology.

true,governmentyard,null,null,"Football in the UK is a component of the national identity, a bit like tea. Others have covered this well, most people, even non-fans of the sport, will tend to have a club, as it's the family club or a partner supports them or it's their local club or somesuch. Emotional hangovers from a major defeat are more profound than they seem to be in things like the NFL.

As for the decline, you can look to a small handful of things.

1: Spain, the current leaders in international football, have more top-qualified coaches in schools than England have in the whole of the game, from infant to professional. That sort of initiative has been lacking here. 

2: We put children in eleven-a-side games on adult sized pitches and expect that to help. In more flamboyant countries, they play on beaches, down alleyways with tennis balls, in small groups, in smaller areas. Close control and confidence are learned when that's what children are receptive to. In England, children are just as big a bunch of glory-seeking show-offs as elsewhere, but in an 11-a-side game the two or three show-offs hog the ball, have space to do that in and half the players in these games just amble about achieving little. Tactics are beyond the children and development falters. On top of this, parents in the UK tend to go to their children's matches and act like they are at Anfield watching Liverpool - braying instructions and abusing refs. From the ground up, a bad behavioural example is made, a bad attitude fostered in young minds. 

3: Spirit of '66. - We won the world cup that year and the media like to mention it so much that even the other home nations (particularly Scotland) now feel that the English are obsessed with that victory and feel we have a god-given right to do it again. It's bullshit, most England fans with an ounce of sense hate the rhetoric and the vast majority of England supporters weren't even alive then. We don't care, the media do. Which brings me on to...

4: If you turn up to play for England and have a competent, boring match you won't be torn apart in the press the next day. If you try to do something amazing and fail, it gets picked up on. That can be the difference between the transfer to play for Real Madrid and having to stay at, say, Stoke (you'd want to be at Madrid). So all these excellent players turn up for England and do the job in a pedestrian manner, lest they become the target of the press' ire and lover their market value. It's not worth the risk, so they don't take it. 

The last time we had a really good team was in 1996, when England hosted the European Championships. We could have won it, got VERY close, and played incredible football. Not only did we have a healthier squad of players who were brought up to really value playing for England, not only did we have a lot of leadership all over the pitch in that tournament, but the squad had been all but destroyed by the press beforehand, written off as a shower of drunks and idiots. 

With nothing to lose, we bloody nearly won.

5: Lastly, while we've always been able to put aside club rivalries for the England team in the past, it's not the case now. I never liked Gary Linekar but when he was playing for England I'd cheer him, but in the modern era we know the arseholes in the England side too well - Wayne Rooney they entitled idiot, John terry the self-aggrandising racist cheat. We're fed daily updates on the worst of these people then we're supposed to cheer them on to victory. No thanks. People care more about their club football now, because they don't know enough about half the payers to hate them.

true,[deleted],null,null,"Why England aren't a top power in world football is a subject that has had untold thousands of words poured into analysing it.

A reddit comment can't really hope to do justice to the sheer amount of hand-wringing that has occured on the subject, but some of the popular theories are:

- because the PL is such a strong league it attracts the best players globally, which means English talent has less of a chance of making the teams.  Various stats showing a smaller % of English players in PL compared to % of Spaniards in the Spanish league (etc), are often given to support this
- conversely, because the English leagues are so strong, it's been argued English players aren't incentivised to go abroad, so they get less breadth of experience
- it's the manager's fault: he might be a brilliant tactician who's won loads of trophies elsewhere, but he's not English, so he doesn't communicate with the players properly, he doesn't understand our footballing culture, we should have chosen an English manager
- it's the manager's fault: we only picked him because he's English, but his grasp of tactics and coaching are not at a level of the world's best, who have won far more trophies
- you can't blame the manager, it's all down to the players.  we simply haven't produced good enough players.  why not?  
- -- we haven't put enough money into grassroots training and youth academies over the years - if we fix this now the footballers we produce in 20 years time will be amazing  
- -- the youth system is to blame in that our academies focus too much on attributes like strength, stamina, and competitiveness whereas Germany/Spain/whoever focus more on skill and technique  
- -- English footballing culture is to blame, in that it is generally dated, there are still too many people wedded to obsolete concepts like long-ball football or man-marking when other nations have long since elevated themselves to a more sophisticated approach  
- no, that's all rubbish, we clearly DO have the players, look at this team on paper, position-for-position that's a match for anybody, and at their clubs the players aren't dated or lacking in skill - it's only when they play for England it doesn't work.  It's because they don't get enough time playing with each other, because club tends to come before country these days, national duties aren't important enough in comparison for them to train together as much
- nonsense, the problem is that national duties are TOO important to them, the problem is psychological.  It's clearly not a lack of talent or tactics but simply the pressure of the nation's excessive expectation that causes England teams to underperform
- we've just been unlucky/cheated by refs: if Maradona's goal hadn't been wrongly allowed we could have at least made the semis that year, if Campbell's goal or Lampard's goal hadn't been wrongly disallowed we could have won it that year, etc

and etc, etc, ad infinitum.  

As you can see many of these explanations are mutually contradictory, some of them are vague but largely feasible, some are rather tenuous and silly.  But there's definitely no one single, simple answer as to why our national team are relatively shit at a sport that is historically English &amp; in which our clubs/leagues are still so good in world terms.",0,1400693181,null,0,1400701372,0,chnn7gk,t3_263mrv,t1_chnn7gk,t3_263mrv,null,1433894680,2,false,AskUK,t5_2t4s3,2

Right now, Migs offers 2 of those 3. I'm not sure we could realistically get a better shot stopper (he's pretty damn good at that). When he came, he looked more than shaky with his feet, but was taught to become better and more comfortable.

I think Lloris is a fantastic keeper--one of the best in the EPL (I'd probably go top 3 or 4). I think he could learn to be good with feet and make the simple passes, which is all Mignolet has done for us. Reina was a real distributor--he had like 6 assists one year. But, with our attack and midfield, we don't need to be as direct. In fact, I'd argue we don't want that.

true,takaznik,capaldi,Capaldi,"A few things for me.

First, the humanism. Our hero (The Doctor) is not stand offish, he doesn't see 'scary' things as a threat (until they actually become one of course), where someone (or most humans in fact) would flee in terror from an alien that looks scary (think jaws and teeth and claws, your basic movie monster) the Doctor would approach them as if they were no different from you or I. The Doctor has an immense passion for life, I find this inspirational. 

Second, the space travel is the most believable out of most modern sci fi shows (this is just my science mind nitpicking..). Where Star Trek and other such things travel across the universe at light speed and get their quickly. This isn't really scientifically plausible because time would past faster at your destination than it would for you. The TARDIS circumvents this with a simple line of ""it can go anywhere in space or time"". The TARDIS isn't really a space ship, it's a time machine (though it can do space too). 

Third, the fact that one story isn't necessarily going to be like another story. In other shows you usually get trapped in that ""hey were on a space ship, IN SPACE!"" and locked into certain types of things. In Doctor Who you can be on Earth (past present or future), far off in some other galaxy somewhere, on a space ship, on a space station, in alternate universes, etc etc. Nothing is beyond the scope of Doctor Who really. 

Finally, the Doctor abhors violence. He very rarely gets to the point where he's violent. In other shows often the solution is ""blow em up!"" in Doctor Who it's more ""let's figure out a way, without harming anyone, to prevent this issue and resolve the problems that caused it in the first place"" 

tl;dr: Do you know Batman? The Doctor is like the Batman of the universe with less vengeance and more compassion for others.

true,Kitchner,cnty-wales,Wales,"Not speaking isn't evidence of guilt on it's own, but neither is being arrested. You are arrested on suspicion of a crime (even if it is ""obvious"" you are guilty) with the courts later deciding your guilt or not.

The warning is there to basically scare you, because if you don't talk to them and then submit testimony for the court case they will question you as to why you didn't mention it before, as surely the innocent would provide all the information needed to clear their name.

For anything with a jury this is almost a moot point though, as you can say a variety of things to justify it (e.g. I wanted to wait until i sought legal advice as I don't trust the police).

There was a time where you only needed to give them your details if you were being charged, no longer though as even though it is technically true there are some circumstances where failing to supply those details is chargeable, meaning you get taken to the station.

Those laws were all brought in as a part of anti-terror and anti-social behaviour laws, the latter being widely supported sadly. ",0,1400694839,null,0,false,0,chno188,t3_2642s8,t1_chno188,t1_chnmstq,null,1433895069,2,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,2

true,Rebelius,cnty-uk,Edinburgh,"&gt;I'll also add that anybody who has been unemployed for a great length of time may know what I'm talking about in regards to happiness. By far the biggest impact of unemployment is on your mental health and wellbeing, which I would go into further but it's very difficult to explain properly. All I know is that I'm happier when i'm working, and that i'm varying levels of miserable when i'm not.

I would argue that it's not the lack of work that makes unemployment miserable, it's the lack of money. This is why I brought up retirement, because that's the kind of unemployed where you still have money and it doesn't make people nearly as miserable.

&gt;Eh? So you disagree that work can be beneficial non-financially?

There are certainly a great many jobs which only offer financial benefits over the alternative. Your previous comment seemed to suggest that doing work makes people happy, I'd argue it's not the work, but the pay - or spending it - that makes you happy when you are in work.

&gt;Such as?

I'd spend my time doing more meaningful things such as fixing up an old car, working on my house, exercise more (running, cycling, swimming), helping my mum out with stuff as she gets old, volunteer work for charities...

Let's say for arguments sake that the Tories get in again at the next election, using your proposed voting system. Famously left-wing constituencies like Brighton for example would have Tory MP's forced upon them because more people voted Tory. This assumes, of course, that you mean that the votes are counted up and the party with the most votes gets total control.

If not, and you were in favour of a system which gives a percentage of seats to each party based roughly around what percentage of the vote they got, you have the fairly obvious problem of how to divide up the seats. The logical conclusion is that the constituencies that voted Labour get Labour, the ones that voted Green get Green, Lib Dem Lib Dem etc. etc. This is called Proportional Representation, and however more fair it is than the current system it still leads us back to ""if 49% of a constituency voted non-Labour and 51% did, 49% of people would be left unhappy."".

Is there any website where I can see all the candidates in one big list, detailing their backgrounds, and what they want to achieve if elected?

I never thought it it that way, I know I'm not that experienced but I think my problem is with areas I'm not used too, I never go too far out of town, whereas these test centres take me quite far out where I would normally ride, so I'm not as used to the environment, when I ride alone/with friends I believe I'm fine, I do lifesavers and check my mirrors like it's second nature, but with these tests with someone watching me I've never been 100% on where they would like to see these, so instead of doing things how I normally would, I think too much about it on what they want, if you get what I mean?

The roundabout in Ghillingham is a massive roundabout [here](http://mymail.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/bowaters.jpg) is a picture of it, I've never used it before so it was confusing to me, didn't help that it was jam packed full of cars so switching lanes was difficult.

I'm not sure exactly if it is the traffic lights, the examiner couldn't remember where it was exactly, but from where I think he was talking about, the traffic light look like this: [image](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/11/15/article-2233534-05B1F5ED000005DC-60_306x684.jpg) rather than [this](http://www.driving-test-success.com/traffic_lights/filter-traffic-light-green-arrow.jpg), not 100% sure, all I know is that I waited for the light to go green and I went in the direction he wanted me to go.

I've done a cbt almost 2 years ago but I've not had any training since, plus that was on a moped, I got a lot of my training from youtube videos, reading online plus a lot of my family used to ride motorcycles. I just did too many, before moving, stopping, changing direction, more than necessary, but I was completely bricking it so thought I couldn't go wrong, heh...

On this road there are no signs, I really looked out for them, I've even went down to visit this road before the exam, there are none, but I spoke to my dad about it and he said if there are street lamps always assume 30 unless a sign tells you otherwise, I was worried about being marked down for being slow as everyone else was going so much faster, I went the speed limit everywhere else, it was just this particular road that got me.

This is just on a 125, for my A2, bigger bike test I will be going with a training body, I was just hoping to pass my A1 so that I wouldn't need to redo my cbt and to gain examination experience, which if I ever pass, will help me with my A2 and A tests in the future.

true,ppphhh,UnionFlag,CBF600N-Kent,"I don't mean to come across as a sarcy bastard, but if you keep failing then you'll ultimately spend more money than if you invest and pass. It sounds like you're making mistakes due to bad luck and stress, which is understandable (I went through a red and forced a van off the road on my first car test) and means that you might well pass next time, or it might keep happening which is going to make you feel worse and give you less confidence every time.

I went on a course for my A test a few years ago, just before they changed the test but while it was still Mod1 &amp; Mod2. I paid I think £120 per day for two and a half days plus the test fee, so it was a lot of money, but it was definitely worth it. I'd been riding daily for two years so I knew how to ride relatively well, but I learned a huge amount with the instructors and really perfected all the road position and lifesaver stuff. I went on to pass both tests with a single minor on each, and both of the minors were nonsense (29km/h through the speed trap instead of 30 and indicating too early). Of course I was lucky and that was the end of the costs for me, but if I'd had to take an A2 a year later I probably would have passed it without a second thought by just practising what they'd taught me. It sounds a bit wishy washy but confidence is everything and having an instructor tell you ""You're definitely capable of passing if you ride like you did today"" will work wonders. Quick edit here: They will also take you on the likely routes that the examiners use and especially problem areas like the island you mentioned, drilling you until you get it. This alone is a huge boost.

We can't decide for you OP, it's your money and if you can't afford it then you can't afford it. There are schools out there that have money back or free further training guarantees if you fail, but they're probably few and far between. As someone's already said, even if you fail the training is worthwhile because it makes you a better rider. I think it's worth it. 

Don't give up! You'll get there. I don't know if anyone's told you but when you book the next test, try and get it for a weird time of day, just after rush hour on a tuesday or something, there will be less idiots on the road. Wear the smartest looking gear you have, high vis if you've got it, and be positive but act a bit nervous.

Another tip about the plates: any car registered after 2002 has a numberplate that has the year and area of registration in it.

A standard numberplate will be XX00 XXX - the first two letters are the registration area (there is a list of areas [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_the_United_Kingdom,_Crown_dependencies_and_overseas_territories#Local_memory_tags)) and the numbers are the six months in which it was registered - 0/1n numbers are roughly the first half, and 5/6n numbers are the second half of the year - so a registration of VE02 JCW is a car that was registered in Worcester in 2002, and a registration of KA62 FRG means it was registered in Luton in the second half of 2012 - the 6 indicates 2010+ as it's one more than the 5 used for the second half of the years in the 2000s. 

Just for interest, older cars have their year in the first letter of the plate, although this can be slightly harder to work out as the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) changed the letter whenever they felt like it.

Seriously? ""They're too busy saving lives."" You're going with that old saw? They're not that busy and releasing information is easy and cheap. They are civil servants, and they have a responsibility to serve the people. If the majority of people decide that they want transparency in government, then that is what must happen. Give the romanticization a rest already.

I didn't say *I* can make a meaningful contribution, I said *we*. Crowdsourcing is only as good as the data provided. So far, crowdsourcing has been a dreadful failure because vested interests have worked against open access to information. Give us the data and watch what we can do!

Probability of Survival Decision Aid... another black box. Probably fuelled with necessary simplifications and wild-assed guesses. Likely paid for by us with no transparency, scrutiny or oversight. Why should I trust a black box? paternalistic garbage. Let's have some peer review by everyone on the planet.

You are too trusting. You think humans are just great, but we screw up constantly. Quackery is universal, and the only defence is fresh air.

And I repeat: saying that survival time for the crew of any vessel equipped with an offshore life raft is twenty hours is a bald-faced self-serving lie, unless you know for certain that the crew is in the water.

EDIT: PSDA. *is* quackery--it says so right in the ""Limitations"" section.

Furthermore, it primarily refers to people in the water, not in a life raft, which is a significant possibility in this case.

&gt;LIMITATIONS
&gt;PSDA was developed from the SCTM and an empirical sweat prediction equation. PSDA uses ten inputs for environmental conditions, human physical parameters, immersion state, and clothing to simulate the survival conditions of victims on or in the water. Obviously, defining survival on the basis of only ten parameters does not capture the complexity, nor fully describe all of the conditions that coalesce to determine actual survival. During actual incidents, additional factors, such as wave height, trauma sustained by the victims, and alcohol use, can influence survival outcome. All models are a simplification of true reality. Survival is a complicated physiology process that can only be studied through accident analysis. Thus, the circumstances surrounding each accident or incident are unique. Well-documented case histories are rarely available to use for validation and/or development of survival models. These limitations make model development a difficult task, as the lack of sufficient data for an in-depth validation ultimately means that the model should be considered, to a degree, untested. With the unavoidable limitations and compromises with respect to model development and validation, it should be clear that the PSDA model, or any survival model, should be used with a degree of caution.",0,1400698293,null,0,1400698916,0,chnpqkn,t3_25uzh7,t1_chnpqkn,t1_chnited,null,1433895873,-1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,-1

There are world class players all around the squad and we've shown that without guys like Kompany, Silva, and Aguero, we can still win (though difficult). Yaya is the ONLY player in this squad that is irreplaceable. There is literally no one in the entire world anything like him. His stature, ability, strength, speed, awareness, and until recently - professionalism, has been the cornerstone of the Manchester City's development. 

How we could ever replace this guy keeps me awake some nights. When he is gone - whether it's sooner or later - will be a massive loss to City and will require a complete change in style. His play sets us apart from Munich and Barca, in that we can play through the middle more and utilize runs from deep in midfield, and then also rely on moments of brilliance outside the box. 

Only time will tell how this saga works out, but I truly feel that finding an option behind this man should be the number one priority, because once he's gone, it will undoubtedly be the biggest loss of any club in the world.

In fact this was the first year since I can remember when I thought he was consistently brilliant. Or consistently anything. You mention how professional he's been up until now, but in years past he would simply not show up to games he felt like we should win. He was the weak link in last years FA cup side. 

He's a great player, one of the best in the world and certainly the best in his position. But this years was the first time I've seen him performing that way consistently enough to really say that. In the past I've always had to add stipulations like ""when he's up for it"" or ""on his day"" which basically nullify the preceding statement. 

I think Pellegrini has a lot to do with his improvement, and who knows, maybe he's become more important to the system under Pellegrini, but honestly, I don't necessarily think we *need* a player like that, and even if we did, there are players potentially available. 

Javi Martinez is supposed to be unsettled at Bayern, and was arguably the best CDM in the world last year. He's more defensive than Yaya at the moment, but he's young, with time to evolve. Yaya started out as a purely defensive player in Spain too. Fernando, who we're said to be in for, could potentially become more attacking under Pellegrini as well. As far as more attacking options go, Fabregas is supposed to be on his way out at Barcelona, and if Yaya really does want to return, a trade could potentially be on the cards. Kroos is also meant to be looking for a way out at Bayern, and Juventus have said they might not be in the financial position to turn down a transfer for Pogba.

The evidence is as plain as can be. At no point did I say that ALL muslims are homophobes, I simply said that a majority are, which is a demonstrable fact.

Just look at the way gays are treated across the muslim world. In some muslim countries they are outright murdered by the state, if caught.

I know that there are some African Christian majority countries which are just as bad, and I am against that too. You can't simply deny the amount of homophobia in the muslim world because of personal anecdotes. The research of organisations like Pew has to be respected, and it is telling that you are so dead set on ignoring it.

You keep acting as if I am only bringing this up because I am prejudiced against muslims. That is absolutely not the case. I simply dislike people who are homophobic, sexist, and anti-semitic. It just so happens that these are all prevalent views in the muslim world. 

If moderate muslim groups want to up their game and begin combatting these sorts of views, and believe me, that is a mammoth of a task, I will stand with them in solidarity.

Free speech, has a limit in this country, yes. Whilst in an ideal world I would fight tooth and nail for my right to total freedom of speech, it's not an ideal world. 

Every week this preacher stands on his pew and provides a brainwashing session for his congregation, manipulating their views by spinning a web of false truths and misleading 'facts'. In the midst of a a spate of disgusting attacks on ethnic minorities around Belfast, the speech that he gave would only have encouraged more people to commit violent acts against ethnic minorities. He is raising tensions when tensions are already sky-high. 

The REALITY, something which you have obviously forgotten is much different than an ideal world of unlimited free speech. 

This is the real world, where there are nasty and vicious people who have used free speech to encourage and help people to commit suicide, who relentlessly bully people until they feel their lives are not worth living and who use lies and psychological manipulations to further their will. 

I'm all for free speech, up to the point where someone's words harm innocent people.

Yes, it does.
&gt;AR414 The Green Party would ban all experimentation and research which harms animals, including harmful procedures used to obtain animal-derived materials. 'Harmful' is defined in this context as 'having the potential to cause pain, suffering, distress, lasting harm or death in animals, except where it is designed to benefit the individual animals concerned.

This will essentially rule out all medical experimentation as there will always be the potential for harm.

&gt;AR420 Patents will not be granted on any animal and strict controls will be introduced to prevent genetic manipulation for profit or curiosity. (see ST363)

The blanket ban they propose on genetic manipulation would devastate medical research in this country - it would rule out the use of [knock-out mice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout_mouse), for example.

Despite that, I can't help but feel fairly meh about the managers whose names are flying around. FdB excites me more than Poch, but only just a little. I have said it before and I'll say it again, I can't  help but think he's had the benefit of being at one of the most cultured clubs top to bottom in the world. He is an Ajax man surrounded by Ajax men who are managing Ajax players who grew up playing the Ajax way and having learned it from Ajax men. I think FdB has done a fine job with Ajax and he did well to turn them around and get them back to being Eredivisie champions. That being said, I believe that the Eredivisie has been weaker in the last 5 years than it was the 5 years preceding that. PSV, Feyenoord and Twente just haven't looked dangerous for awhile. While I think he could be a very good manager, I think he's had some pretty good winds blowing in his sails. I just wonder if he'd be able to replicate the success that he has had at Ajax at a club like Tottenham given what a tremendous advantage he has had there. 

I personally would rather see us chasing after Martinez who I believe we were foolish in passing on the last time we were looking for a new manager. If not Martinez, who admittedly is a very long shot, then I also think there are a few managers in the Bundesliga who we should be looking at before Poch and FdB.

The current thing with UKIP is a reaction to this phenomenon, it's the disengagement that people have with the other parties that are propelling them. However, you may get your wish if the main parties realise that this disengagement is fuelling their decline, they will have to work harder to engage people and consider changing the system to promote that.

I agree that far more could be achieved by people taking action of whatever peaceful kind to directly solve problems. However, there is nothing to stop you doing both. I reckon I spend less than 10 minutes per year voting on average. It's no hardship.

I do want to ask though, are you doing any of those things that you note? If so, how much? I pick up the occasional piece of litter and have a couple of monthly direct debits set up for charities, but I don't think any of that is particularly extraordinary. If feel with this, like most things, everyone is waiting for everyone else to start doing these things before they themselves start - so it doesn't happen.

Going back to the voting, I live in a seat that has been with one party since the 90s, but that has been a close contest each year. My MP has a good attendance record, sends considered responses to my e-mails and makes sensible expenses claims. Also, my MP rebelled against tuition fees increases. When there is a strong local opposition, it encourages politicians to work hard for you.

Additionally, going back to your take action argument. I would say there are more democratic tools than ever before (3+ levels of elections, public consultations, e-petitions). There is a better opportunity to get opinions out there (blogging, Facebook, twitter). We have better access to the inner workings of the state (FOI requests, data.gov.uk, etc.).

Food is the key. You need to eat shit ^((not literally)^) that releases energy slowly. I.e fruit. I always have some fruit on a day of exams, and sometimes just before an exam.

Also keep hydrated. Caffeine is **not** a good idea. It's a good stimulant, but it releases energy fast, and you don't want that because once your energy levels come down, you'll feel even shittier than before. Plus (for those of you who have seen Inbetweeners), you might shit yourself in the exam hall. Water is preferable. Just don't drink too much. There's nothing worse than needing a piss during an exam, and there's nothing more awkward than getting up and going to the toilet during an exam. Plus, needing to go to the toilet affects your concentration. Obviously, in an exam, this isn't a good thing. 

Don't overdo revision. Just before an exam, do a bit of revision, but don't go over the entire unit. 

Just remember that a 2 hour exam is a pretty normal length for an exam, so doing 2 exams 1 hour each isn't really that much of a big deal. The History exam goes by so quickly.

No, quite the contrary.  (Relative) equality does.  You can't make a slave of an equal.

&gt;If you made money in your lifetime you should be free to dispose of that money upon your death as you wish

Much of our dispute probably lies in whether we believe that capitalists ""make"" their own money, or whether other people make it for them.

&gt;Inevitably, yes.

I wish it were inevitable, or even remotely likely.  I've not met too many right wingers who renounce all forms of rent, most of them fiercely defend it in one form or other.  What about intellectual property for example, do you support that corporate subsidy?  Or workfare and restraints on combination of labour?  What passes for privatisation and businesses which make the lion's share of their profits at the State trough?  R and D (nothing smart in the smart phone which didn't get subsidised by us working people via the State, etc.)?  There are many many ways in which the State subsidises corporations, the straightforward handovers of billions in public cash to banksters and CEOs are just the icing on the cake.

&gt;There is always a balance to be struck between freedom and security. Those who would sacrifice freedom to ensure security deserve neither.

Of course, but when the risk is always taken by those who are kept poor by the State and never by those who are enriched by it, excuse me if I find that aphorism a bit hollow.

&gt;The primary duty of the state is to provide security for it's citizenry. 

Whereas the primary role of the modern military and police is to protect corporate interests at home and abroad against the interests of its citizenry.

&gt;a limited free trade zone that prevents us trading with other partners.

You'll need to expand on how the EU prevents us from trading with no EU partners.  I'm not a fan particularly (the EU is largely a corporate sausage fest, but it gives a small bone to the workers sometimes), but I fail to see how the EU prevents us from trading outside the EU, since that's the whole point of it, it's about bargaining power.

&gt;Libertarianism isn't the province of the left or right, as the political compass demonstrates.

The only bit I sort of agree with is this:

&gt; I’ve gone from being ‘Gifted and Talented‘ to a number, exactly the same as everyone else and completely average. Seeing friends at other unis easily getting 2:1s and firsts and struggling to maintain a 2:2 is the most disheartening thing to happen to me.

If you are used to being at the top of your school, then it is absolutely a culture shift coming to Cambridge. Do not expect it to be easy. That said, I think one of the most important things I learnt at university is that getting good grades in exams is very far down in the list of important things in my life.

&gt; Am I getting my money’s worth? Hell, no. I’m paying £9000 a year to go to a handful of lectures and do a bunch of independent study.

By virtue of the supervision system here, Cambridge offers a lot more contact time than most university courses, and with some of the best academics in the world. £9,000/year is a lot of money, but is the standard cost of an undergraduate degree in England now. At the very least, you are not getting worse value for money than at other English universities.

&gt; Of those lectures, only 1 or 2 actually benefit me in any way towards my exams. I’ve had to have Skype supervisions because my supervisors don’t have enough time for me.

This sounds completely wrong to me, but it might vary depending on subject. In the sciences (specifically engineering, which was my subject), you will have 10+ lectures each week, all of which are directly targeted towards the end-of-year exams. In addition to these you will have several hours of lab work each week, putting into practice the theory from lectures. If the student is not receiving the supervisions to which they are entitled, then they should complain to the college, and to their department.

&gt; it frustrates me constantly that people don’t wake up and realise how obnoxious they’ve become

Labour, the Conservatives, and the LibDems would rather they stayed home (so would I, to be fair!)

As you said, you have a choice between voting for the least-worst/tactical option, or not vote. Voting for the least-worst, or voting tactically, tells those in power that you are not happy with them. Not voting plays straight into their hands. Look at local elections, where the voter turnout is very low. How much gets changed? How much hand-wringing about low voter turn-outs do you get? You might get a couple talking-heads saying it's a shame in the day or two after the election, but then it's quickly forgotten. One of the big parties is back in power, everyone is happy. 

I'd love to see a none-of-the-above option. If a candidate was running who says he will change election laws to allow that, I'd probably vote for him.

Remember that if only five people in the whole country vote, and three of them vote for party A, then party A is in charge for the next four years, regardless of turnout. A party gets its mandate NOT from the number of people that voted for it, but from the percentage of votes it received. Nobody gives the slightest shit how many votes were cast in total. 

I do agree with you that they are all useless wankers. So keep voting them out. It's literally *all we can do*.",0,1400708889,null,0,false,0,chnv12g,t3_2643z7,t1_chnv12g,t1_chnuod4,null,1433898432,1,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,1

At Thai is also an option, but if you are a large group, expect to put down a large surcharge (£50-100), which it's highly likely they refuse to give back to you, for no given reason. It's not the best option in my opinion.

If you want a decent BYOB curry house, go to Chutney's, which is Bill Clinton's favourite apparently! As someone who quite enjoys curries, this is by far the best bet for getting a decent one for a large group in the centre of town. Avoid Arzoo's and Mirch Masala like the plague, as the curries are pretty awful.

It's funny cos I hate UKIP... But I hate r/uk and the uk in general more than I hate UKIP. Everyone here seems so quick to be the least 'racist' and everyone is full of shit. The UK is inherently contradictory and full of bullshit.

I wonder how many of r/uk have listened to any of the discussions or songs by Akala (ms Dynamite's brother) because that guy is a bloody genius and seems to always hit the nail on the head with life in the UK.

We're talking people who think [this](http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/socialist-standard/election-manifestos) is an achievable goal.

To give an example, during the election campaign for a former SU president (who is now a vice president at ULU and recently got involved in a scandal where he exploited a loophole in the NUS system to secure himself a place that is supposed to be reserved for A-level students), he was queried about his economic view of the world - being asked how he thinks the government should be expected to handle he deficit, his answer (horrifically paraphrased from memory): ""We don't need to handle the deficit.  The concept of a deficit is an imaginary construct and thus can be completely dismissed, we should focus on just increasing spending on education.""

So yeah what you now have is an NUS which thinks that it can solve all the world's problems (and I seriously mean ALL the world's problems, it took a lot of anguish during one of our SU general meetings to make sure a motion for the SU to publicly support the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was defeated) by encouraging people to take the ""socialist"" answer, whilst having a knee jerk protest any time a policeman doing his job means he has to arrest a student.",0,1400710668,null,0,1400711552,0,chnvumm,t3_26571s,t1_chnvumm,t1_chntwan,null,1433898820,29,false,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,29

I say this for one reason and one reason only, He is injury prone...

People say he is one of the best DM in the PL and that's true, when he is healthy, but this is a player who the most PL games he has ever played in a season for Spurs is 23. [source](http://www.espnfc.com/player/_/id/147337/sandro?cc=5901)  That is only 60% of the games and that was during his best season for Spurs. So while people say he is the best DM in the PL, that he is a building block for this team, and that we would be crazy to sell him we are talking about someone who has missed an absurd amount of time to injury. Heck arsenal fans have been saying that Diaby is one of the best CMs in the world, the reality is it doesn't matter how good someone is if they never play. I realize Sandro is not really close to Diaby's level of injuries but I think people sometimes forget just how often he has been out to injuries. And i think its hard to build around players who are always hurt. For that reason I think cutting and running while his stock is still high isnt the worst idea in the world even though i would be sad to see him leave.",0,1400711302,null,0,false,0,chnw4yx,t3_265gw4,t1_chnw4yx,t3_265gw4,null,1433898955,22,false,coys,t5_2ryq7,22

”Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship Harman and accept that she was the most highly-evolved being the world has ever known, even greater than Marx himself!”

At this moment, a brave, patriotic, pro-life ukipper champion who had given out over 1500 VOTE UKIP leaflets and understood the necessity of mild racism and fully supported all statements made by Nigel Farage stood up.

”What is the age of consent nonce?”

The arrogant professor smirked quite Jewishly and smugly replied “14 you stupid racist”.

”Wrong. It's still 16. Harman failed in her campaign. Having sex with anyone under 16 is not only immoral it's illegal and nonces should be hung. Dig up Jimmy Saville and hang him.”

The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Ed: The Milibands and the making of a Labour leader. He stormed out of the room crying those socialist crocodile tears. The same tears socialists cry for the “poor” (who today live in such luxury that most own refrigerators) when they jealously try to claw justly earned wealth from the deserving job creators. He wished so much that he had a gun to shoot himself from embarrassment, but he himself had petitioned against them!

The students applauded and all registered UKIP that day and accepted Nigel Farage as their lord and savior. A kestrel named “NO TO BARROSO” flew into the room and perched atop the British Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. Jerusalem was sung several times, and Farage himself showed up and enacted a flat tax rate across the country.

Our SU used to be filled with moderately thinking people who focussed solely on trying to support the needs of the students on campus.  Aside from a rather humorous campaign entitled ""Keep Your Cap On"" against tuition fee rises which involved people posing nude using only a cap to censor themselves in 2008, there wasn't really much politics.

Then the coalition got into power and started announcing cuts and when the SU took the soft approach of just joining the NUS walk, a vocal bunch of students set up a campaign team called the ""anti-cuts alliance"" advocating more ""revolutionary"" tactics such as occupying buildings and protesting at Whitehall, and jeering at politicians.  This group then went from being an annoying minority to managing to completely takeover the entire SU exec team after the next elections..

/pol/ might be a authoritative racist shithole, but that doesn't mean that it reflects the views of all right wingers. In fact, it's mostly people trying to be edgy, and not a place for legitimate politician discussion.

I mean, you can't just blame right wing government for all the sins. slavery and colonialism was started under he monarchy, and was overseen by many left and right wing politicians.

Why does reddit have this view that liberalism is our saving grace? A healthy political system considers what is best as per required by the situation, and I believe a party that adapts to the needs of the people within reason is a good party. If the situation calls for left or right wing, so be it.

Anyway the way I see it, extreme liberalism is just as bad as extreme conservatism. A true democratic country needs a diverse yet non fanatical political spectrum.

Also, my two cents: just because a speech is xenophobic is no cause to downvote it. If anything, it should be upvoted, because even if you don't agree with it, there will always be people that do, and if you downvote those people, it'll only fuel their oppressed mentality thought process.

You have Monday-Friday 2 hours of lectures (9-11AM), although you can skip most of them without a hitch as lecture notes are on the department website and some lecturers really just read them out loud (depending on your lecturer obviously).  
You have 4 or 5 tutorials (5 in the last term) and you have to do a problem sheet for each of them. Problem sheets are usually one page, could be more but usually isn't less. [Here](http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/courses/material) you can go and find problem sheets for different topics etc if you like so you can see what you're dealing with.  
As for time spent? Well, my is awesome with Maths and had ~75% from both of her collections, and a problem sheet can take various amounts of time, from an hour to 2-3 I'd say.   
During term time, going to lectures, tutorials and stuff, she still finds time to go out and have fun(which means alcohol and hangovers, so she has at least a day lost), play sports (few hours a week, I'd say maybe 10 hours on average?), watch some movies on Netflix and relax. And this is even now with exams 
approaching! But then, she worked pretty hard during both breaks so there's that.  
It all depends on how well and quickly can you do your problem sheets, what are your revision techniques etc etc, but you can easily have a life doing Maths which is one of the more no-life courses (seeing that people doing Engineering do nothing 99% of the time is really frustrating) if you manage your time.

true,Woodentop_renegade,null,null,"The federation cannot be described as a union. It is in place of a union. In the police strike of 1919 about half of all officers who did go on strike were fired. It wasn't illegal then. It was made illegal promptly afterwards. It scared the Government and they didn't want a repeat. They realised that officers could make ludicous demands and they'd have to bow to them. They also recognised that officers should be able to have a say over pay and conditions. 

To get around this they set up the federation which would represent officers views. Taking any form of industrial action is illegal. In fact even talking about it even semi-seriously is an offence. The idea is then that when a dispute arises the federation takes it to the government and if unresolved it goes to the police arbitration tribunal (PAT) who then come to a decision. PAT has members from the staff side and official side.  It is up to them to come to an agreement.

The government, with the Winsor reforms has rather taken the mick and the PAT hasn't really worked out very favourably for officers at all because of Government bullying and a failure by the official side to concede on any points. This has caused a lot of resentment among the rank and file and that's why more and more police officers want the right to form a union and take industrial action. No one wants to take industrial action but since the government will just change the law at will to suit them and not respect the PAT process its a tool that more and more want to stop them doing that.

In the BF Story ""Sympathy for the Devil,"" an alternate Third Doctor is stuck in Hong Kong in the mid nineties (as opposed to England in the 70s-80s as happened in canon).  While their, he attempts to speak to what he thinks is a local in Cantonese...only to find out she's English, and switches over.  Furthermore, later in the story, when he is talking to a Chinese pilot, none of the other characters can understand the Doctor while he's speaking whatever Chinese language he's speaking at that particular moment, so it's not the TARDIS telepathically making his language understandable to all in the area.  Furthermore, the Chinese Pilot says a word that the Doctor can't understand at one point (basically a word for ""Monster in a Jar""), so it wasn't a telepathic translation for the DOCTOR either.

That said, it is a Big Finish Production, and one that isn't even canon within Big Finish's timeline.

All the uninteresting/ bad anecdotes, or more revealing stories that an actor might accidentally tell get edited out, arguably a more ""fake"" approach.

&gt;

&gt;___The Graham Norton Effect___ is a [talk show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show) hosted by the [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland) [comedian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian) [Graham Norton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Norton). The show aired on [Comedy Central](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_Central) from June 24, 2004 to September 16, 2004.

&gt;*The Graham Norton Effect* can be considered a [spin-off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media\)) to two previous shows hosted by Norton, including *[So Graham Norton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_Graham_Norton)* and *[V Graham Norton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_Graham_Norton)*. During the last part of Graham's [Channel 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4) contract, Graham decided to film a new show, NY Graham Norton, in New York. *The Graham Norton Effect* was filmed for Comedy Central later in the year. Since this show was specifically taped for an American audience, some of the games played in the show were previously played on *NY Graham Norton* or *V Graham Norton*. (For example, a game about the world's worst bathing suits which was played in the Alan Cumming episode was originally played during a V episode with Bo Derek, tying into her movie *[10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_(film\))*.) Also, some of the guests, who were only on *NY Graham Norton* a couple of months previous, appear again on *The Graham Norton Effect*.

true,nomsville,english,Hertfordshire,"Do you remember the last general election? They were hyped up massively before, running on the platform of ""we're not these other arseholes"", got massively fucked over by FPTP (First Past The Post, our voting system that means almost half of the people in marginal constituencies get silenced) and voter opinion divide, then jumped straight to the opportunity of a coalition government after there was a hung parliament (tories didn't win a clear majority in the House of Commons). A lot of people felt betrayed by this (most lib dems are generally left leaning and would sooner side with Labour than Conservatives) and felt their vote was wasted on them. They then did a lot of things the tories wanted whilst only managing to get a couple of their ideas through. The ones they did get through were piddly (a referendum on AV was never going to be popular when not much of the populace knows diddly squat about AV), and the things they compromised on were big (university tuition fees rising being the biggest). Their popularity fell massively, mostly the people caught in the Clegg hype from before the GE, and the image of Clegg being Cameron's whipping boy became a household fact.

That's generally why, however a lot of people see them as the people who sit on the fence and don't have the balls to take a hardline on anything. Personally, I like my politics to take the best of both worlds and be more considered so I don't mind voting Lib Dem. However I got pretty pissed at them after the last general election as I thought they were too keen to get to power and gave up too many policies in the process. I hate the way the Lib Dems are used as human shields for a lot of the torie's unpopular policies. I can't blame them for wanting a shot at the executive after being the 3rd party for so long, but they lost a lot of their integrity.

Finally, they have become increasingly popular, not just among normally Conservative voters (YouGov's final election poll, for example, put them at 27%: more than any other party).

This has led to a flurry of commenter seeking to point out that (a) they think being in the European Union is a rather good thing, and (b) UKIP is full of racists, homophobes, and people who all represent the very worst of the far right (including a series of stories fed to the press by people from the Conservative Party).  As a counter to that, a lot of people have said that point b is prioritised over point a, and that therefore point a may well be wrong.  They say UKIP is being attacked on personal grounds because the mainstream doesn't want to draw attention to an important issue.  Then the people mentioned at the start of this paragraph disagree and say that it's actually a combination of those reasons, and other people exaggerate, and Nigel Farage adopts a pretty presentable face as leader of the party, and so on ad infinitum:

true,Antsonfire,num18,,"&gt;Do you believe Soldado suits the style of footaball spurs played in 13/14?

It's a strange question to answer, pretty much because we played two different systems. Under AVB, his poaching skills were kept to a minimum because the midfield couldn't break through the defense in the first place. With Sherwood, he looked bad with a resurgent Adebayor. Fortunately, he's learning. That amazing cross to Ade at Southampton, the midfield shift against Norwich, these aren't things you'd expect from a player who looks so limited on paper. His first touch is magnificent for what he's supposed to be doing, and his assist record from last season is respectable. 

Do you believe Soldado will fit the style of play that any of the prospective managers play?

&gt;In your eyes is Soldado a flop? Why or why not?

Nah. 
Again, Soldado's willing to show that he can learn, even at 28. He doesn't have a lot of years left, and while it is true that we bought him to score goals, his work ethic and ability to play deeper than Ade in the second striker role means that he might succeed just yet under the right manager. 

&gt;What would you like to see happen with Soldado over the next 12 months (retained? starting? bench?)?

Retained, preferably starting. The Ajax system demands defending from the front, and if his shift to a second striker as opposed to a pure goalscorer this season is any indicator of how quickly he can learn, then I think there'd be a spot for him open. My hierarchy of strikers next season will be Soldado, Kane, and Insert Young Belgian Striker Here.

I think he's got a future here. Given that his wife had a miscarriage, I can forgive him for the bad times he's given us (that miss against Man U comes to mind).

The boy, who is seen in the CCTV footage walking with a friend, picks up the defenceless animal by the scruff of the neck and throws her to two dogs on the other side of the fence.

RSPCA inspectors said the black and white feline was left ‘severely shaken’ after the incident in Shetcliffe Lane, Bradford, and are now trying to identify the two boys in the clip.


‘The owner heard a commotion in her backyard and when she went out she saw her cat land on the paved area and run off in sheer terror,’ said inspector Rachel Oprysk.

'We believe these boys threw the cat over the garden boundary with the intention of her being attacked by the Rottweiler and Alaskan Shepherd on the other side.

‘Luckily the garden they chose was the cat’s home so the dogs were used to the cat and did not see her as an intruder.

‘The black and white female cat was shaken and scared but, thankfully, otherwise unhurt.’

The pros:

* vast range of cars to choose from, mostly fairly new (2-3 years old) and ex-fleet (= well-maintained)
* no pressure at all or hassling from salesmen while you're looking at the cars
* the price you see is the price you pay, you're not expected to spend half an hour haggling to knock a couple of grand off

The cons:

* most cars there are ex-fleet, which means if you're looking for something quirky or unusual your choice is very limited
* no opportunity to haggle the price down; the sales staff simply do not have authority to change the ticket price at all
* quite a lot of pressure to take out loan agreements and various insurances (this is where they make their real money, much like electronics stores with their extended warranty sales)

So if you just want a fairly ordinary car that's in decent nick, they'll do you fine. The price will be OK but if you're prepared to spend hours browsing around the classifieds you could probably get something similar for a little less.

They're really exactly what they say on the tin: supermarkets, so for people who just want a car, rather than people who love cars.

It's nice that the members get to vote on policies, in theory at least.  In practice it means that rational thinking goes out the window in favour of popularism.  They claim to support ""evidence-based policy"" and not ""policy-based evidence"", but I don't see how that can be possible when policy is determined by their membership, many of whom appear to be firmly against anything science because it has chemicals in it.

true,G_A,NoBike,'06 SV650s,"I can offer some advice specific to Gillingham, as I live and took both of my modules there.

Firstly, go with the training school. You'll not only be taught how to pass your tests, you'll be taught how to be a far safer rider on the road.

I initially used [Mid Kent Motorcycle Training](http://www.mkmt.co.uk/), then for financial reasons I went with a second  training body when I had to retake my first module, [A to Z Rider Training](http://www.atozridertraining.co.uk/) were significantly cheaper due to being based in Elmscourt Village, next door to the test centre.

Regarding Gillingham, and what you apparently had issues with, you have roundabouts. You have [Bowater roundabout](http://mymail.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/bowaters.jpg), which should be the one you first attempt to understand completely as you 100% WILL be tested on this one.

My module 2 ride from Gillingham involved a route that went down into the residential area of Gillingham between the river Medway and the top road ( the A2 ), with stop signs and one way systems.

If you go with a training school and mention you're training in Gillingham, they'll take you on a ride very similar to the one you should expect to take in the test.

The training school will also drill into you correctly executing lifesavers, and test you on what speed you should be doing, in addition to defensive riding.

What I'd suggest would be to retake your CBT, it should be a hundred pounds or so, and come next year when you've the funds, go for the full  A2 restricted license properly.

You will 100% need the funds for the license as you HAVE to go with a training school for the bike hire, insurance, and instructor ( all bundled into one cost ), and you can continue to use your current bike ( presumably a 125 ) on your full license. You will also want a bigger bike after having ridden something like a GS500 though ;)",0,1400747103,null,0,false,0,cho92f0,t3_264mtx,t1_cho92f0,t3_264mtx,null,1433905186,2,false,MotoUK,t5_2wf1v,2

I do the same, as storm drains offer good opportunities for the kind of long exposure photos I do, but after reading a few accounts of people in other countries drowning during unexpected rainstorms (mostly in the US and Australia) I pay special attention to the weather before going into one. 

Tidal interceptor drains can be the most dangerous, as they don't just allow the rainwater runoff, but also allow for tidal surges. This means they often have large chambers, which makes them appealing to drainors (that's the word used by people who explore drains as a hobby).

I know it sounds a rather ridiculous pastime, but sometimes some pretty impressive structures can be found underground. Like [The Death Star](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tigtab/8585266226/) in Melbourne.

The thing that makes draining dodgy, is the fact that they fill up fast when it rains, it's easy to forget how big the catchment area can be for a single drain which is channeling all the rain into one relatively narrow tunnel, so the currents can be quite strong.
